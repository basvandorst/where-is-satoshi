I certainly wouldn't buy BTC at that price since Kraken is selling BTC for about 405 EUR. You have the choice to ignore sellers who are charging too much. I think both BitStamp and Kraken deal in EUR-BTC exchange. I see BitStamp is currently at 403 EUR. If you can't deal with a real exchange like them then you may end up paying a premium for convenience elsewhere. Usually when I sell BTC on LocalBitcoins I get pretty close to a BitFinex price. You just need to check around more.

$100 into mining is a guaranteed losing investment. $100 into BTC has at least some chance of being worth more in the years to come. $100 into studying computer science is unnecessary as everything can be learned for free online with even a modest amount of digging - and learning to do the digging and exploring is as valuable as the content you'll find.

You can choose what units from the preferences. You can calculate how much you're short and send a second tx with the balance. Should be fine.
As soon as I saw your figures I thought you probably were using mBTC without realizing.
btw the other address should show up in your addresses list under the section labeled "change". It is a change address used for returning tx outputs back to your own wallet.

Did you ever check if maybe the QR code shown for every trx is not the one you intended but one his app substitutes with his own address? You should go back and try scanning QR codes for test trxs and see if they all scan correctly (on independent QR scanner). If it turns out that it replaces QR codes then this was not even your mistake but obviously a scam app that needs to be removed from the stores. And you have a much better case for reporting to authorities - though it also means he intended to scam and is likely in some country where he can't be easily found or identified. But even still it's worth knowing and reporting for future users sake.

I think the idea is that someone used leverage to buy a lot of btc hoping to sell when higher. If you do that and the price drops then you may be forced to sell them because you no longer have enough on account to maintain your margin ratio. I'm not convinced this is even known or factual. If you are in that position then presumably you wouldn't have to sell all btc but just enough to maintain your margin.
The real issue here is that exchanges like OkCoin that (IIRC) don't charge fees are obviously making money in other ways and one way is to use inside knowledge like margin call positions and stop-loss positions to "reap rewards" by selling btc to trigger these events and then buying back at the now much lower prices. I'm sure there's lots of tricky unethical ways they can "make" money from the sheep.

Depends on the trx as it may have several inputs but also this would be a bad choice as there is no way to know if the key is available or under the sender's control. The correct way is to request the sender to sign a message with a key used in the original trx, and provide a suitable return address. Just sending the pmt "back" could very easily result it in being permanently lost and possibly they could be held responsible.

Taint just indicates connection between addresses. It does not imply something is wrong or bad about the btc or the address. It's a poor choice of label as it really just means "connectedness". There is another meaning for taint which I have more affection towards.
I expect that Coinbase probably has their own in house evaluation methods and maybe you ran afoul of that rather than this thing called "taint".  As others have mentioned here Coinbase is like an hysterical PC anal probing school principal trying to make sure no one is swearing out back behind the gym. Better to just avoid them (which it seems you have no choice about anyway).

Hey, $13 is an improvement. Last week they wanted to add $20 to my $23 namecheap bill on top of the $3 miner fee I already was including. 
I understand they need to move BTC afterwards to an exchange to sell but that could be controlled better and given they have systems in place and programmers they should be able to do it for less than me, not 6x more than I pay. They could start with receiving on segwit addresses, and then batching pmts to an exchange to sell. 
LocalBitcoins is another one that's gotten really crappy at handling their internal consolidation txs, and feels the need to charge $20 for every deposit (on the last day I checked).
@_date: 2016-04-23 14:21:06
That's because it's a cardboard cut out.
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:24:09
And even for ones that do there are cases where you cannot use it. eg. Electrum does but you cannot use pay-to-many to decrease your tx cost by batching your payments. This was how I ran into the issue and it stopped me from paying namecheap and using Paypal instead. Is that the intent now of Bitpay - to make Bitcoin unusable? Well, it worked. But it was actually the $20 add-on "network fee" that really made me change.
@_date: 2016-04-13 15:44:31
Install Electrum. Create a single key wallet by importing your key from Armory. Then create a normal wallet (with seed words written down). Send btc from single-key wallet to normal wallet. Once confirmed then delete single key wallet and just use normal wallet from now on. Electrum installs in minutes and doesn't need to sync the blockchain. If you are dealing with a significant amount then look into tutorials on "Offline signing for Electrum" to use as more secure offline wallet.
If you are dealing with a small amount that you wouldn't worry about having on your phone then try a phone wallet like Mycelium. It can sweep your Armory key and be usable immediately.

Sure those are to blame too but when I'm paying 0.5 mbtc for a miner fee to deposit why should I also pay 3x as much just for the privilege of depositing? Is that how the business model works or are they taking a cut of the trade? That makes it terrible to sell smaller amounts - total cost to get btc in there was going to be 1.9 mbtc. And then have to deal with buyers and exchange rates. I'd expect if they're using segwit and saving some on internal tx handling that would be reflected in deposit fees rather than just benefit them in lower costs.

That's not a standard btc fee at all. It should be a few cents or so. But as to what Coinbase may be doing - that's another story. If they converted it to USD then they probably do charge a fee, maybe 1%. But if it's still sitting in your account as BTC (and only the display is saying it's "current value") then you haven't paid any more than a miner fee (a few cents usually), and the USD difference may just be an estimated based on current exchange rate (which changes constantly). If you don't actually exchange it to USD then they wouldn't charge an additional fee. Or, at least I think that's right as I don't use Coinbase, but have used other exchanges.

Did you get in touch with the Mycelium guys about how to recover your wallet and they confirmed that you cannot do anything? I don't use iPhone version but I know on Android it's impossible to lose btc because I wrote down my seed on day one and tucked it away safely.
@_date: 2016-04-12 02:14:44
Or it could shoot up and you'd be so happy. But each must decide for themselves. I keep a dangerously large percent of net worth as BTC (mostly because I also get paid in BTC every week and usually don't convert it). If you don't want to risk it, or all of it, then you're safer to convert to USD. Most places take a fee for that. It used to be that BTC would bounce around a few percent every day and it wasn't hard to offset the fee by waiting an hour but nowadays it's been too stable. $10 up and down for a while is only +/- 0.25% roughly. 
@_date: 2016-04-13 21:06:57
You wouldn't keep large fund balances on a LN account. You'd store them safely in a offline btc wallet and then use an LN account like a hot wallet for daily needs. At least, that's how I see it.Maybe once a week or month you might fund some spending money to a LN account for buying stuff online but most of your BTC would be tucked away in a long term wallet. I think that's what I'd do. I guess it depends on some fairly usable LN accounts to be available. For those who need more privacy or permissionless I think having BTC as a backbone still allows for that but you probably don't need that for coffee, buying gadgets and daily other stuff.

Not just in Russia of course - almost worldwide. Many laws are on the books simply for a revenue stream. eg. In Thailand you're fine to drive without a license or motorcycle helmet but if you come upon a police stop, well, that'll cost you a few hundred baht before you can drive on. It's possible that in Russia the eventual result will be that discovering you have btc will mean forfeiture and release, though I don't know how they usually play with enforcement there (so this is a guess).

Usually in an exchange like that you would "lock in" a price for some limited time. For example, most web sites would quote a BTC amount and then give you 15 minutes or so to complete the payment. It can be a bit problematic if it's going to take you a long time to buy BTC (eg. waiting for a seller or for AML verification) as you have to basically buy an amount you hope will cover the exchange even with a bit of variance. This is the same with any foreign exchange trade except Bitcoin does tend to move more than the larger more stable currencies and so time limits are typically short.

I wonder if they're profiting off it even. HitBTC certainly is. The other day I withdrew and they charged 1 mbtc. I checked the tx on a block explorer and it had 301 outputs, meaning they likely collected 300 mbtc for that tx. What was the fee? 26 mbtc - so they scooped up 274 mbtc at customers expense and when I complained they sent me a canned email saying the network was congested and my tx would confirm soon. It took a few hours and that isn't my gripe. My gripe is that for a slow confirm I should not be charged 1 mbtc when 92% of that went in their pockets. I'd love to see an analysis of who the worst offenders are in this area so we can choose where to do business because I'm totally out of HitBTC now and not going back. What's the best alternative for strictly crypto-only exchanges?

@_date: 2018-01-12 09:47:20
Well, actually they're making YOU pay for it (unless you use GDAX I guess). Many exchanges and services are now pushing this cost to the user without any choice about tx urgency, or fee selection. In cases where they have your BTC and you want it back you truly have no choice. And in my experience, as noted above checking the explorer on my tx, they pocket 90% of the fee anyway.

satoshis are the smallest BTC unit = 1/100,000,000 BTC or 0.00000001
bytes are how we measure ttransaction size. Well, actually it's now called "weight" but most estimators still treat it as bytes even though it's a bit more abstract now.
so the cost per byte is a measure of fee rate - bigger transaction size means higher fee. But transaction size has nothing to do amount being sent. It's determined by number of inputs and outputs in the transaction and whether they are segwit or normal inputs (which is where weight comes in and are discounted). Sending 1 BTC will cost more if it consumes 10 inputs compared to just 1 input. (And in case you don't know an *input* is simply the *output* from another transaction, ie. the one you received into your wallet with).

@_date: 2018-01-15 01:46:08
It depends of course. When I can I try to combine several outputs at once (batching) as that helps cut cost per pmt. eg. my last tx had 4 outputs (to both a vendor, an exchange and 2 others) and was only 380 bytes. Outputs take much less space than inputs so average down well. Not many wallets support doing that but Electrum does with menu Tools, Pay to Many.

Prevailing fees were 170 sat/byte. Then I wanted to deposit on LBC and you wanted ~$20 (1.4 mbtc) for the deposit. How is paying 5x the mining fee anywhere near reasonable? Do you actually expect me to believe it costs you 5x as many txs fees to "handle utxos"? Or are you overpaying by 5x and then laying the cost on users, blaming the network for your inability to pay fees correctly? Do utxo consolidations even need to be done asap next block, high priority?

A good calculator lets you put in a difficulty increase percent. Don't skimp on that because new tech is just hitting which will push it much higher.
Also, I'd suggest you just buy BTC instead of miner rigs. If the BTC price drops your miner output will be lower (go quickly towards zero) and rig value drops. If BTC price rises you gain directly and don't need to bother with hassles of equipment and mining. Invested miner capital will only depreciate, never increase. With BTC your capital potentially may 10x if halvening follows past patterns. That is a much better upside vs mining.

Your best bet then is to get the **blocks** subdirectory from someone else. If you get that and place **only** that in your local bitcoin data dir then start bitcoin it will re-validate and build a new chainstate without downloading. That means you have verified the perhaps untrusted data. I don't think you can do this starting with pruned data so you temporarily need more space, then you can set pruned=xxxx to delete old blocks once validated.
So, you could start with a usb drive containing most of the blockchain "blocks" only, validate it, prune it to, say, 5 GB. Copy that to your main SSD and continue on from that base keeping it updated.
As for where to get the blocks if you don't want to download via data plan? Well, IDK - get creative, ask friends, use someones ADSL connection. I have an old near dead hard disk kicking around and can send if you cover postage. That kind of thing.

A confirmation is when your transaction gets mined into a block. It is possible to get scammed with only a single confirmation and only looking at your single wallet but it's not something easily done for small amounts. After being included in a block each additional block mined after that is another confirmation and implies more difficulty in altering a transaction status. Even 2-3 is extremely unlikely but for large amounts it's good to be safe. I'd suggest being able to check your wallet or address status with two sources, eg. wallet and explorer web site, but I wouldn't worry much if only a few hundred usd value.
Also, before doing much more I'd suggest reading basic Bitcoin guides so that terms like this aren't baffling. It will help with confidence when dealing with others.

Do not just send it back. A test with small amount may be ok but you have no way to know the originating address is still under the owners control. It is entirely plausible it was sent and then deleted or key was temporary. 
There is no way to find out who the owner is. Someone may contact you but you must ensure they can sign a message with the originating key in order to know they were the ones who sent you the btc. If you don't know how to validate a signed message then seek help.

The actual seed format is different. Electrum seeds encode wallet type info where as BIP39 doesn't. If you could restore on Ledger with only a master private key (xprv) then the any derivation path difference could be overcome. I don't own a Ledger so not sure but I don't think you can restore with only the xprv. If you can then you could use the iancoleman tool with derivation path to get that and restore. But then you still need an airgapped system to use that securely.
Probably your best choice is to create a new BIP39 seed on the ledger or with dice and then move btc to that wallet. If the lack of airgapped system is the issue then you can create a usb linux boot stick and achieve the same security on a temporary boot of your normal system.
@_date: 2019-07-01 21:01:14
I wrote a small tool [(bip39chk)]( for that a while back that uses Electrum modules. Unfortunately they re-org'd some functions and changed it enough that it doesn't run with the latest version any more. I'll get around to either fixing or merging in code so it's independent but have not had time yet. I'm not even sure what the last working version may be. If this cmd line tool would be useful for others I can fix it.
**edit** - I quick hacked my old code so it works for validating seed chksum but disabled key info and address list output. At least this works partly. It can finish/validate a seed. I pushed up new commit to repo.
If you stick to a 12 word seed there is only 16 possible last words to check for validity so it's not as hard manually (8 trials on average). The [diceware bip39]( chart makes this pretty easy. 24 word seed has 256 possible words to check, 8 bit chksum.

I would verify in a known clean Electrum or alternate system/wallet to ensure you have been using addresses that match ones from the hw wallet. As long as you haven't been tricked into using the wrong address list you should be ok. If you already checked that then I'd say you're fine. You may have lost any privacy. The malware could have sent the mpk home allowing a thief to monitor your wallet but fortunately most malware is for "lowest hanging fruit", and probably can't deal with hw wallet and/or multisig.

For small amounts and convenience a mobile phone wallet is easiest. When installed it will provide you with an address that you can send btc to. The address will change after use but don't worry that normal. It does that to avoid re-using them and spoil privacy.

Electrum gives you an address to send bitcoin to on the "Receive" tab. You can also see many more addresses with "View, Show Addresses".
Wherever you are buying bitcoin, or anyone sending to you, will need an address to send to. On exchanges it's usually labelled as "Withdraw Bitcoin", and it has an address "TO" field.
Do not store large amounts of Bitcoin on a your regular desktop system. Malware and hackers make this not very safe. Electrum is a great wallet but it cannot stop malware or hacking your system. For noobs the easiest way to get secure bitcoin storage is with a hardware wallet like a Trezor, or Ledger. That's a small usb dongle that secures the coins. Next best for small amounts is using a mobile phone wallet - many options available but stick with well known apps.

That won't work. The 0.0.0.0 is a special setting for EPS that tells it to listen on the systems public IP (which in this case means the LAN IP rather than localhost, not the real public internet IP). So, basically you can listen on 0.0.0.0 but you cannot connect to 0.0.0.0 - you always have to connect to a valid IP on the LAN.
But when telling Electrum where to connect it needs a your LAN IP for the mining/EPS system. "localhost" means "connect to myself".
As exmaple, if your LAN is using 192.168.0.1 as router/gateway and the mining system is 192.168.0.10 and your laptop has been assigned 192.168.0.20 then using 0.0.0.0 in EPS means it is listening on 192.168.0.10. Electrum needs that IP for connect to EPS. It's own IP doesn't matter.
Going one step further you can lookup your router model online for details on setting up "port forwarding". If you configure that router to "port forward" to 192.168.0.10 (in my example LAN range), and same port# (50002) - then anyone on the internet that connects to your REAL public IP (that is assigned by your ISP to your router) will be forwarded thru to your mining rig at 192.168.0.10. That is how you get access to EPS from the internet. 
(BUT do not port fwd for a real wallet without creating your own SSL cert first and replacing the default one in EPS config.)

Wipe your system, or at very least clean it well.
The main thing you need to worry (other than installing fake Electrum) is always fully verify addresses on your hw wallet when signing. That is your final defense - that the address presented on it's screen is the correct one you want to send to. 
It's possible for malware to change addresses in your PC but if you verify on the device screen you'll NOT confirm any tx attempting to subvert / steal your btc.

It just occurred to me that I think EPS is using SSL by default but it uses a certificate they provide. So even in that case using your own EPS via internet means creating a self-signed certificate first otherwise anyone can intercept private data. Creating your own self-signed cert is not hard but it is another step usually done with openssl at command line. There's probably some info in the EPS docs and if not then I've seen tutorials on the net before.

12 words = 128 bits, 2^128 ~ 1 in 10^38
24 words = 256 bits, 2^256 ~ 1 in 10^77
But multiple private keys can map to one address meaning the actual chance of keys colliding is ~ 2^160 or 1 in 10^48. So regardless of seed there is no benefit beyond that limit. 
A 12 word seed is safe enough but a 24 word seed is more safe in a way that doesn't matter. A 15 word seed almost matches the limit of address space.
Actually, the worst case probability is a few orders lower. Consider the current utxo set is ~32 million. That represents an upper bound on number of wallets containing any btc (some not even worth stealing though). You'd need to guess a seed that has one of those for it to be gainful. So divide above estimates by 32 million, or to round it off say 10^8 - subtract 8 from exponent in above chances.

@_date: 2019-07-01 03:37:03
You mention setting 0.0.0.0 but not being able to connect. That's right if not within the same local network. If it has to go out via internet then that's not enough unless some form of routing is present, eg static routes, VPN etc. You could try temporarily connecting your laptop to the same network as the EPS system so that you can test connection. That would give you an indication it's setup properly.
There is ways to connect two networks so they can access servers between them. It really depends on the actual setup of your two networks. If they share some common gateway to the internet then it may simple like adding a "static route" on that gateway so that the IP range on one network is visible to the other network. If they have no common gateway (ie. have to use internet) then you can configure a VPN or other private tunneling but the best/easiest option depends.
When the two systems are in different locations with an internet route between them then you have some security issues to content with, and the configuration becomes more difficult. First, the EPS server would need to have it's listening port forwarded thru your router so it's listening on the main public IP (of the router), ie. your actual internet IP rather than a LAN IP. But doing this also requires using SSL for security. Maybe EPS is using that by default (not sure) but if not then it means setting up a self-signed SSL certificate. This keeps communication between Electrum and the server private. 
Electrum would connect to your routers public IP. But if you are on ADSL (or other dynamic IP services) then that IP can change so you then need to configure means to update the IP, which generally means using a [free domain name]( and Dynamic DNS updating. It's not hard for experienced network admins but can be a lot for beginners.
Another method for all this is using a secure tunnel. This is almost easy on Linux systems because the tools to do it are usually present on base systems. For Windows it's a bit more challenging as well. It still requires running an **ssh server** on either the miner/EPS or laptop system. It also still needs dynamic IP updating or a fixed IP (some internet providers give fixed IPs but many don't, so something you'd need to know first). Anyway, it's not simple either way. It is much easier to use EPS within the same network (no public access) even if it's only temporarily when eg. plugging in laptop now and then.

Yay. Finally.
I have a file server at home for media (movies/tv shows) and run my node and EPS on that. I leave EPS on all the time and only open Electrum when I want to check something or do a tx. EPS doesn't take any resources really - it just sits there listening, so no down side to that. I'm only using it locally at home, for now, so don't use port forwarding at all. 
Port forwarding is only needed on the server (EPS) side (not for Electrum side).
If you go on your mining system and use a browser to open a page like  that will show the real public IP as seen from that network. Likewise if you open it from laptop it will show real IP being used by laptop network.
Business customers often get a fixed IP from their ISP. But many home users get "dynamic" IPs. That means they often change everyday. So you cannot depend on that IP remaining the same. Whatever it is at any moment, you can use that to connect to your router from anywhere on the internet.
Most routers (which act as a gateway for your network) are not listening on any ports. When you config a "port forward" you are telling it to listen and forward any connections thru to a local system. That exposes that one port on that system to the internet at large. That's useful, but also can open it to vulnerability as well. 
If you port fwd for your mining system then you can connect to EPS from anywhere with internet access by using your real public IP at that mining system location in Electrum config.
If you know that IP changes often then the best thing is to run a dynamic dns (ddns) client on your mining system. I can tell you how but also there's heaps of tutorials around the web. In that case you use the chosen name in your Electrum config. eg. from [freedns]( you can get a free name like thatsmynode.mooo.com and set that in your Electrum instead of an IP value. The ddns client on your mining system keeps the IP fresh and Electrum uses the name to get the current IP using normal DNS lookup. Together with a self-signed SSL cert you can access your own EPS node from anywhere with pretty good security.

An address can have 0 or more utxos (unspent transaction outputs). Each utxo must be spent fully similar to how bills/coins must be spent and change given. When a sum of utxos is more than the required pmt output another tx output is added paying the leftover back usually to another wallet address. But the same address can be used.
In this case, from other info posted here, it appears this tx is for Omni coin. That is a 2nd layer on top Bitcoin. So the tx OP_RETURN output holds info linking the Omni tx. That's probably why it just pays back to itself. I don't know anything about Omni so I'm pretty much guessing at that.

You can run EPS on your mining rig if it has a full or pruned node. The system does not need any special configuration to be a server. EPS will need some options set for it to listen "publicly" (not really public but that term is used when not "localhost"). I'd suggest running EPS on whichever system is running the full or pruned node. That is the easiest way to setup, but not mandatory.
Is your mining rig also running a node? Is it a Linux system or Windows/Mac? Is it in the same local network or is it in a different location that requires the internet to get get to? Each of these affect setup choices/options.
As for those commands, yes, both. Each one sets a different option in the config file. oneserver only needs to be run once but the other can be run any time you want to update the IP to connect on.
There are 3 components overall: bitcoin node, EPS, Electrum. If all are on the same system then setup is pretty easy. If the node and EPS are on one system and Electrum on another then both systems need proper configuring. You seem to have Electrum config under control now and just need an IP address to finish.
The system running node+EPS will have an IP that needs to be given to Electrum. But also the EPS config file needs to be configured to listen publicly as by default it only listens (allows connections) locally (localhost, same system). 
In the EPS config file there is a section [electrum-server] which has a line "host=...". That needs to be set as "host=0.0.0.0" which tells it to listen public (any) and allows your other system to connect. This is the same file where you will insert your xpub (master public key) values.
If connecting EPS to Electurm via the internet (not local LAN) this gets much more complicated and I'd really suggest not doing that without deeper tech skills.

Ethernet cable or wifi won't matter if they both use the same IP range. 
In the router it has network settings for determining this. Sometimes they assign two different networks but generally in most cases the wifi and ethernet both share a common IP range and assignment group. In that case your can connect easily between them. If not then there has to be a static route setting in the router to bridge between segments. Unless you find otherwise I would assume the wifi and ethernet IPs can talk to each other.

I've been programming since the 80s in many different areas. Also, more than a decade doing admin on linux servers and network stuff. It's all just stuff I've accumulated over time probably mostly learned online via googling. But in the early years I learned mostly from books. Took one compsci course in university in '84 but otherwise physics/math so not really related. Nowadays just google and read your way through mountains of info.
There's no need to set a pwd on bitcoin core because it's watch-only, ie. addresses only, no keys. So it cannot sign/spend btc. That part is handled by Electrum and it should have a pwd already or use a hw wallet (better!).
Addresses work always even if not online or connected. Electrum will let you view history and address list even when it cannot  update via server. If you copy an address and save somewhere you can always send to it regardless of Electrum being open/closed. You just won't see any info in the wallet until it can sync up.
If using Electrum with a Ledger I think it will allow creating a tx even if not updated as long as you're spending an output already in the wallet. If it doesn't know about some tx then you won't be able to spend those btc until updated. You can do a tx from Ledger with their own wallet and Electrum will update later when you get it connected and sync. You just lose some privacy as you expose addresses to the Ledger servers.

Sorry about the delay. My internet actually was down for two weeks. Some ADSL issue out of my control.
Back in the 80s I worked for a while selling compaq "car top" clones (as we joked about them being bigger than "lap tops") in a retail store. I never thought about anything like Bitcoin until I read about it in 2011 and I was immediately enthusiastic about it but mostly about the opportunity of mining to make some income. It took me weeks of reading to actually understand it. I really enjoyed the first couple seasons of that show "Halt and Catch Fire" about computer business in the 80s. After that it kinda got boring and too gamey. I was never much into games but I did spend several years working for Disney Interactive coding kids games. All my co-workers played Doom/Quake etc. after 6pm but I just went home to the fam.
Not sure what question about pwd on bitcoin was. If it's working then I wouldn't worry about it. If not, describe what's wrong.
Yes, when not sync'd it cannot know about new txs and won't show them. As for privacy the main leaks are (1) using a service which logs IP, eg. Ledger web site wallet, public electrum servers, explorer sites to look up tx info, etc and (2) actual tx input/output tracking using heuristics of common usage patterns, and sometimes wallet defects, to associate addresses together as a wallet. This combined with (1) and/or pmts to vendors with address info. Ideally a wallet you want to keep very private would never be used to pay anyone who has location or ID info.
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:21:08
Not to mention tat every vendor selling stuff is likely to keep a float in their channel as they use it as a conduit to their exchange for cashing out for non-btc expenses. I mean they will decide it's worth keeping some btc in the channel so as new pmts come in it's fast and easy to move the excess to the exchange (one which is also LN enabled). I think it is this potential which maybe is most counter to the BitPay business model (though there is no reason, except more competition, lower take, that they don't offer this functionality).

It's mostly online pmts like hosting strangely that are problems now and that's primarily because BitPay services them and cannot get their backend more efficient, or maybe has other reasons not to want that. I could really use a Bitcoin debit card but all the ones I've seen charge too much. I guess they don't have much choice if the banking networks fees to issue a card are high.

Doesn't matter how much "business" you speak there's a certain segment that just cannot work with $20 being added to every invoice. Like hosting - one of the main online uses for BTC. I just can't see it as acceptable to add $20 "network fee" to a $20/mo. VPS bill (and I'm talking in addition to the miner fee you're already going to pay). That's a death spiral no matter how you talk it up and why? Because they can't figure out how to cheaply consolidate incoming pmts and get them to an exchange to sell they're adding on a 6x markup.

Most likely they don't even know they're doing it but are cursing that fees are so high.

LOL. Three development teams...
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:23:59
I noticed that too, but don't worry it just saves you the extra $20 network fee they're also adding on.
I wanted to pay two bills with one tx - pay to many using Electrum but cannot do that without an address. So not only are they adding extra fees but they're forcing me to make two txs instead of one. In the end I just dropped that one and used Paypal for that, but I did do a 4 output tx paying several others. 289 bytes for 1 in-4 out, saved me quite a bit in fees.
Hey, I'm outraged with how sucky their tech efficiency skills are. Most people see the fee and blame the network. I blame them.

Coinbase doesn't need to have enough because it's the buyer who has USD if they want to buy Bitcoin. 
When Bitcoin reaches 100K then that implicitly means the trades that occurred as it approaches are already for USD, or other fiat. are already happening at that price. You can't get to 100K without people paying that price for BTC. So maybe what you mean is will it crash again once it touches 100K? Oh, probably, most likely. People have this weird fascination with round numbers. But I'm selling at 99,876 so I can retire, again - ha, beating the crowd. /s

I don't think they remove code related to decentralized consensus but in practice they have so few operators that you can hardly call it that. I think they start out based on some principle and when not joined by the majority they devolve into a pet project run mostly to stroke the ego of those orchestrating the fork or, worse even, outright scams tricking people who don't know better. Especially if actively doing things like using name confusion, fake nodes or a single mining entity behind the scenes.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:30:08
They don't even need 0.5 (if you meant hash power). If they had 5% of current rate then they would find a block on average roughly once each day. If that block fills with low value txs that are also small or also Segwit (because, incentive) then it could have some impact. I'm not sure this is a good use of funds though. 
I'd personally rather see more uptake in LTC acceptance as a workaround. Sure it's an altcoin but it has two positives - 1. it's not Bcash so it's not actively trying to damage Bitcoin, 2. They have LN and Segwit already so they are heading in the right direction progress wise, and it can be used for test cases on smaller value txs. Maybe some support from the pineapple towards that would have more effect.

I don't know if many are dropping it but several key businesses are making it unusable except for high dollar amounts. BitpPay, the processor of almost all online places that accept it, nows adds ~$20 on to every payment on top of what you pay the miners as a "network fee". That makes it untenable for anything less than a few hundred dollars. LocalBitcoins has had a deposit fee of $25 for many months now making it hard to sell BTC there in the same dollar range. 
One of the mainstays of BTC use online has been hosting fees and domain names. Almost all of those companies that accept it now have to contend with $20 fees being added to their $20-100/mo. bread and butter VPS and small dedicated server range. If they haven't dropped it yet they will once use shrivels up.
IMO BitPay has become another BitMain/Bank controlled bad actor in this field and one that is very damaging to usability way beyond just the miner fee we pay when sending. If I want to pay a $30 hosting fee I can live with an extra $3 as miner fee (and grumble about how it used to be almost free) but when that is compounded with another $20 network fee? It's forced me back to Paypal, and since I get paid in BTC I really, really would rather pay with it. And IMO the "network fee" is because they have no way to cover their business model on normal 1% fees, and because they don't improve their internal processing methods (Maybe they need to send multiple txs for every one they receive? Is it really that bad for tx amplification? Or they can't manage consolidation txs on a slower confirmation timescale? Why do they need to charge 6x what I pay for a quick confirmation - riddle me that, except because they can't make ends meet on their advertised 1% take.)
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:48:53
Wait. Are they shipping cards out now or is this about getting on a waiting list for when maybe they will be available? I could really use a low-fee Visa card that allows me to spend BTC but I'm certainly not buying minimum ~$850 MCO tokens to get the option. I see a plastic free card but wonder if it's all vapour ware.

Thx for info.
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:10:48
It's probably borderline for now but they've taken the mouth-breather approach to business and are now charging customers 6x markup on txs as if they purposefully want to aggravate the situation in hopes of selling their other solution: BCH. It's almost as though they are cashing in while they can before going belly up, which is my ignorant onlookers opinion of where they're heading.

@_date: 2017-12-01 12:18:47
Sure, but to do that you are going to need a lot of disk space. The Insight API/Explorer was using about 300GB back when the blockchain was ~50GB. I can only imagine what it must use now that the blockchain is 170GB. Maybe 1TB? People forget this when they discuss "big blocks" but the size and cost to run an explorer site for big blocks gets prohibitive, especially considering these sites usually are free to use.
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:36:35
No. We will likely still need to increase the block size but LN will leverage the size by allowing unlimited numbers of txs in that blocksize. Those using LN will be paying a "high fee" very rarely, when a channel breaks down or when switching channels, whereas those avoiding it will be paying them for every tx.
The analogy isn't quite right because LN channels are non-custodial but it's kind of like a free-checking account - you wouldn't be switching banks every time you write a check, but you may have some reason to switch banks when you're not happy with them.

If it does what they or you say then it would be great. All the BTC debit cards I've seen charge high fees. I could definitely use a visa BTC card. If the ID verification isn't crazy hard and the fees are not too high I'd go for it. I guess there's a trust issue too and how it works as far as giving them BTC to hold. If proven over time I'd probably try it.
edit - upon reading it more it seems to be hooked into MCO tokens and a purchase. I don't know if I'd do that. I guess it depends on how much is at risk. Maybe not.

Free checking is usually not really free either. There's almost always some catch like minimum balance, monthly fee or something. It's quite likely that exchanges wanting customers will offer free txs with LN just as they used to do with BTC before it got too expensive for them. Also, they should be able to lock BTC in channels and then offer transacting throught the channels for their customers (on their behalf), meaning the fees to open/close for customer use would be negligible. I guess how what they do their remains to be seen. I'd expect there to be competition incentives though.

Sure. $20 for the pizza and $25 for the fees. Not the miner fees, but the add-on fee that BitPay charges and blames on the miners. Thank you BitMain (who now apparently controls BitPay). 
Where did that decentralized p2p transaction model go? Well, it seems most retailers/vendors can't deal with integrating Bitcoin directly, or still don't have the quick and easy tools to make it happen, or need instant conversion due to volatility.
Don't say I'm shilling. I've been a very strong supporter of the better long term road map and 2nd layer solutions. I get paid in BTC so I really, really want to spend it directly when I can. I don't own or use any altcoins and extra especially not shitcoin BCH.

Well, that's fantasy. Every crypto is consumed with price watching. I don't see that as bad. It's just that people doing actual underlying technical work are NOT on here talking about it. Programming work is inherently not blathering away on reddit. reddit is not completely suited to extended technical discussion anyway. Every day the same repeated topics come up and are endlessly argued over. Technical discussion requires and ongoing, long term thread that actually stays in place and doesn't drop out of scope because of the focus on "newsworthy" events.
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:04:31
Are we talking about the Bitcoin network or Coinbase accounts? Because on the Bitcoin network people use nodes and Coinbase users can already have zero fee txs if Coinbase wanted - no need for a network at all, just like Paypal. And with a simple agreement they could pull BitPay into the circle and probably cut down a huge portion of on chain txs today. No need for nodes in that model and it's already well proven with decades of past use.

Sounds like you want [payment requests]( and there is already a protocol for that in use since 2013. Many merchants use it. Take for example any site that uses Bitpay to accept BTC. If your wallet supports the payment request protocol then it verifies with a certificate on the merchant site and co-ordinates the address and purchase info.

If people would just damn well use segwit now then they could achieve near 4MB blocks today. It's already in the network - it just needs people sending from segwit addresses - something exchanges and other large tx creators could start doing right now. But they'd rather just pass on the higher fees to their customers.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:13:06
They wanted to charge me $20 barely 15 minutes after I sent a tx for $3 fee that confirmed in first block. So how is adding a 6x miner fee not controlling the fees? Are they really saying they need to send 6x as many txs internally that needs to be paid for in addition to my already paying for the miner fee. If they add BCH I will stand even more angrily against their practices as they have had LTC available for years and never worked on integrating that. Supporting BCH is directly the influence of BitMain and their desire to keep segwit from working (due to it preventing asicboost). They could work on improving their tx processing efficiency so they don't need to charge 6x the miner fee on every tx. IMO they're in a downward spiral now and adding BCH will just hasten it as they get boycotted by their own customer base. And the only reason BCH fees are pennies is because no one uses it. If it got more use you'd see the same shenanigans with it under stress but far worse because it would be controlled entirely by the main bad actor in Bitcoin today = BitMain and their cohorts.

I don't mind including a less known altcoin if it's been coded and submitted. I have not yet pushed up my changes to support altcoins. I have them locally and I'm testing on a VPS right now (litecoin, reddcoin for the moment). I have about 50 commits waiting but since most of them depend on a db schema change and upgrade I didn't want to push them up where others may be affected. I don't think there is many using it currently but who knows. If you want to test with my current fixes and upgrades (bech32, altcoin and more) send me a pm and I'll pass on v0.2.5 as a tar.gz. I'm also testing with mariadb on the new installs and would like to try it with TokuDB since it reportedly is much faster with random primary keys (very much the case for tx,addr,output ids). I'll probably have to leave that til next time. 
Depending on what changes CLAM needs it could be a matter of adding a few entries to a couple tables. There is provision for overriding the block/tx decoding or more with a python module and also for custom db schema changes via a override sql file (both of these only when detected).
sqlchain really does requires an SSD for main db / indices due to having hashed primary keys, but space requirements are quite modest (comparatively speaking), and there is options for dropping signature/witness data, and storing blob data or older historic data on alternate cheaper media (even s3). Just pm me to chat more.

You can fully verify your cold storage address exactly the same on your node. The question is why they need to send to one address so you can send to another instead of them sending direct - either way you can verify on your node. I mean your node can load an address as watch-only. I thought that was an ability way back in 2012 or before, right? No need for you to pay a fee again if your employer pays it.
But the real problem for Bitcoin right now is the major players have turned against it. The most popular payment processor is adding on outrageous extra fees on top of what we already pay for txs. BitPay is now adding on $20 fees even when we pay a miner fee already. They're basically saying their business model is so inefficient that they need to charge $20 to cover txs. I could easily bear paying ($4) to namecheap for a service directly, but BitPay gets in the middle and now it's a $24 fee. Afaik namecheap is just taking USD out to their bank so there's no need to cover an additional 6 more layers of txs. Far too many vendors are hooked into BitPay, and not accepting txs themselves, and BitPay is using tx fees as a way to mask their money losing business model.

See my tutorial last month on upgrading Tails.
You can do it easily but without persistence you need to keep the archive handy (on a usb stick) and unarchive it each time you need to use it. That literally takes a few seconds.
Also, if you load a tx from file and there is no Sign button it usually means there is a tx input that cannot be signed with the keys available. ie. wrong wallet or seed, mismatch. Or it could be version compatibility. It's pretty normal for old software to not be compatible with future versions, because, well, time travel and such, they didn't know the future when they wrote 2.7.9. That said, in my many times doing offline signing I have usually not had issues with wallet versions. There is as much compatibility as they can manage given circumstances.

I think it turns out to be hard. I'm not sure what these estimators are doing but they don't work well. Maybe they try to get too "theoretical" about it. I just look at the mempool chart and choose a fee in a band that is getting chomped on. So algorithm wise if they split the fee rate into bands and then chose the lowest one that had, say 20-30% accepted in the last block then that would probably be close to what I do visually. Piece a' cake. Apparently not.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:25:19
No, it's directed at exactly who is preventing me from making my own choice about what fee I can pay (which is not $25 btw). 
And it's directed at the people who won't implement segwit in their system and who are subverting LN and future Bitcoin expansion by supporting Bcash instead. This looks to me like another attempt to move Bitcoin users into a walled garden they have full control over, seeing as how they are in a partnership with the largest miner and would love it if they could run Bitcoin as a new Paypal. This smacks too much already of them being the gatekeepers of peoples transactions - it's a perfect example of how they want to control Bitcoin use.

Gotta have an excuse for BitPay to charge an extra $20 on every $5 pmt, ON TOP of what you include as fees.
They couldn't possibly use Segwit to reduce their internal transfers, they couldn't possibly use slower confirms for housekeeping, AFTER they get your BTC. I just sent one to my wallet for 170 sat/byte (confirmed in 5 minutes) and then they turn around and want 5x that on top of what I was going to include at similar rate to pay Namecheap. Payment canceled, sorry Namecheap will have to wait as I'm not paying for BitPays bloated transaction handling.

Not sure where you can check on BitPay. I know because I tried to pay Namecheap for some domain names and was presented with an invoice on the BitPay site for $42 (in BTC) on my $23 top-up. I think it broke it down as $23 pmt plus 0.0014... "network fee". But I'm already including a fee in my payment to them - so is "network" fee their way of offsetting their cost of doing business? I canceled the process. So I guess if you wanted to verify you can probably go to pay any vendor that uses them (almost all, it seems) and then see what they want to tack on to your pmt. At the time I did this I had just sent a Bitcoin pmt and had it confirm in ~10 minutes with a 170 sat/byte fee (~$4). So I fully expected to pay that again and even though it hurts a bit on a $23 domain bill, it's not as absolutely ridiculous as paying yet another ~$20 on top "for whatever".
I've actually paid many times on Namecheap before. They may have tacked on some amount I didn't really notice, so the actual process may not have changed. Not really sure, as it's been more than 6 months since doing a domain pmt.

I'm pretty sure, but not positive, that you would need to have funds in the channels opened and that pmts in balance pmts out so it stays fairly balanced, or maybe needs re-balancing from time to time. On the positive side it actually adds another incentive to lock up funds rather than just price rise.

What wallet is that? Right at this moment ([checking here]( you should be able to send for 120 sat/byte. On a typical (225 byte tx) that would be 0.27 mbtc or $4.32 and should get pretty fast confirmation. BUT, many wallets have poor fee estimation, over pay or don't allow manual entry. If you can manually set a custom fee then you can send for less, and if not then you may be able to restore the wallet seed in Electrum and use it's manual fee support. And if not that, then wait. It's not like you're going to die without $20 and there's a decent chance it will be worth much more when LN finally is usable.

No. We can deal with that but it's because of add-on fees. Fees to withdraw, fees added to miner fees to pay. Fees to deposit now. We are getting hit with fees on top of mining every which way you turn and that is not what Bitcoin was meant to be. It was meant to get us away from that and allow direct p2p transactions. Unfortunately the real world steps in and every business that deals with it adds on another layers of fees, and steep ones too, unless you're paying for &gt;$1000 items and can absorb it (even then with a grimace). Every online vendor that uses BitPay now has to deal with $20 being added to their invoice. Kind of makes the $.35 paypal/visa per tx fee look like the free we once bragged about.

It's only a few lines of code to verify for the public key derivation. It is simply a "point multiply" using some special EC math. I have a few small python utils on my github for this that I created for my own use. [Here is one]( where I break out the EC math so that it depends on no external libraries. That code is for generating from a seed using Electrum v1 method but that includes the pt multiply. I mainly used that to understand exactly what the math does under the hood. The rest is number base conversion and formatting.
At the level of deriving a public key and converting base formats there is very little code to verify. When it gets wrapped into a full wallet that gets more difficult as often so many more modules / libraries get pulled in to the mix.

You're going to find that unless you buy at the best exchanges on the planet, which is hard or impossible for most people, you will be paying a higher price. This is typical and will likely diminish as demand increases competition. 
On the up side you'll often find the price you can sell at is higher too. So the "spread" may be the same, though it depends entirely on circumstances, and your own intentions in using btc. 
If you are buying to hold long term then don't worry about it - it won't matter. You should be holding beyond the next major supply crisis next year (halving) at a minimum and 5-10% will be minor.

You can use Electrum offline for this and it's likely your best, easiest choice. There are several ways but maybe easiest is to download [Tails]( and make a bootable USB stick. Follow steps on their site.
- Disconnect from the net, Boot on Tails and start Electrum from main menu. 
- Create a wallet and write down the seed words. Also, if you'd like to monitor the wallet safely online, export the MPK (Master Public Key item from Wallet menu) and save that on another disk/usb stick. 
- Write down or print/save the addresses you need. It is possible to generate more than the default (20, if I recall) using the console tab the command: `wallet.create_new_address()` (use up arrow to repeat).
- When you shutdown Tails, the wallet will not persist - it will be destroyed and you will need the seed words if you want to access it again. But you can use the saved addresses. And you can use the MPK to restore a watch-only version on any desktop without worrying about exposing private keys.
You can also do this process using a second totally offline system, the cheapest probably being a Raspberry Pi (though the steps are a bit different).

Electrum installed on a raspberry pi ($35) is a good offline wallet that is seed based. You can also use the rasp pi for other things and swap the SD card when you need to access funds. Requires a bit more techie know how than a Ledger or Trezor. Just mentioning it as it's probably the cheapest offline PC and actually free if you use the rasp pi as a media center (with your TV). The SD card is the wallet and a 12 word seed written down as secure backup. There are several step by step guides for this kicking around the web.

With timestamping, like [proofofexistence.com]( your document isn't stored in the blockchain but a hash of the document is. This acts of proof because later a document can be hashed and it will have the same hash value only if it's an identical document. So on that web site you select a document file and it hashes it in your browser and sticks the hash value in the blockchain by creating a transaction with the hash embedded. You still need the original document if you later want to verify/prove that it existed on the date-time of the block.
Later, to prove your document existed you hash it again and then compare it against the hash already stored in the transaction.

A signature is a computed result that can only be had if the correct private key is used in it's computation. The miners and btc nodes check signatures for every trx before accepting them. So the protection is that any invalid signature is discarded by the network, thus preventing transfer of funds. When the correct key is used to compute the signature the signed trx is considered valid and accepted in the blockchain. There is some complex math involved and at a layman level this simply needs to be trusted (although it is well established and the same math is used in practically all online security/trusted systems - "elliptic curve cryptography").
You need to keep your private keys secure and that is the intent of the wallet and encryption. The highest level of key security is with hardware wallets, offline signing (keys are never on a system connected to a network) and multi-signature transactions (that require more than one signature for acceptance on the network).

I think it's easier to hash the work and use that as a private key, then generate the address and send to that. Of course, if the lyrics become public the private key is spoiled and you'd either want to spend it forward or make the amount trivial. But as stated already there is no legally significant treatment for blockchain transactions. It would be nice to see a legal precedent set that acknowledges the blockchain as a valid timestamp.

How about encoding the (encrypted?) key in the facets of the gem itself.

It depends on how he calculated that figure, whether tps or by size. And even though more outputs obviously is bigger the difference is very significant. A single output trx has approx. 33 bytes for output data out of a total of a few hundred bytes. ie. about 10%. So having a large volume of trx with one output is 90% inputs and overhead (though I do realize in the real world we'd need 2 outputs anyway). Now compare that with a 171 output trx that is 171*33 (5673 bytes) plus the same inputs and overhead - approx. 5900 bytes, or 34.5 bytes per output on average, only wasting 5% on inputs and overhead. Numbers are approximate but this is pretty far from "wouldn't do much".
edit: I seem to recall the limit being around 3000 outputs/trx, and if you paid a large number of people that way from a large input value then you get very close to 33 bytes per pmt (or person in this case), or for the absurd example of paying 60 million people non-stop that's about 2000 blocks, or around 14 days.

You can query some items using your node. It can be accessed using an RPC interface so you'd need some software to do that. To be very useful you need to have txindex=1 in the conf file (tx indexing enabled). If it's not then you cannot search by tx_id. You pretty much can otherwise only do stuff related to your wallet addresses. It's not a generic database of the blockchain which is why explorer sites always process the full node data into sql database to allow more flexible querying. A full node uses leveldb for key-value stores of the particular keys it needs for operation but was never intended to be a general purpose explorer.

I'm not familiar with that but a quick google on it turns up some posts about running  Picuntu linux on it. Presumably that's a version of Ubuntu for this device. If so, and I didn't read much on it, then you can install Electrum on top of Picuntu and then have an offline wallet you use by plugging into your (HDMI) TV. Not sure about keyboard (need for password) but maybe an onscreen keyboard. 
Here's the first link I got on that and seems to imply you can install linux on mk808 nand memory (or SD card). That would be a first step in using Electrum offline. I would then use [Aussiehash's SBC]( installer as the simplest way to get Electrum on that. And then you never connect that device to a network again (for security) and just use it with the TV.
Installing in Nand would be good as then the SD card can be used to copy on/off the unsigned/signed transaction when you want to access funds. If you want to do this and need help let me know. I don't have one but it would be pretty interesting if people could make an offline wallet with this device.
There is an Electrum for Android too but it requires installing the Android Python and isn't a popular wallet. I don't think it's been upgraded to &gt;2.0 either (though I may be wrong). I'm only personally familiar with Electrum on Linux (Raspbian on Raspberry Pi, or Ubuntu/Mint on laptop).

I think it allows de-seeding to make a watch only wallet already. I don't think you can import random addresses as watch only, or I missed it if it can. 
For an offline wallet it would be useful to have a tool to generate a wallet on a disconnected system that could then have it's xpubkey imported. It is BIP44 so maybe that's enough if a known compatible tool exists. Although I don't currently see any way to import an xpubkey. Importing the seed and de-seeding is not really adequate.
@_date: 2015-12-16 22:08:27
That's interesting and I didn't know about it. I guess it has a trezor cpu / circuit on it. I'm thinking of something that looks like that, fits a zero but does all wallet functions using Electrum on the Zero (or some other software, but Electrum is a big head start and has an api interface). You can pick up small color LCDs on ebay for a couple $ now. Plug one on a small board with buttons and connector. Not for your average user but I like small hacks like that.

A full node currently takes about 170GB. sqlchain reduces that to about 100GB. If you only need to query your own wallet addresses then you can use a pruned node and get away with about 3GB, but that has no info on the other peoples addresses or txs (except a small recent portion). I'm not sure what you really want to achieve. It sounds like you should just use a site blockchain.info, though probably not that one; there are many out there now.

Any address in your addresses tab will still work, forever, ie. not lose money. It's preferable to use one that hasn't been used as it reduces the ability to associate addresses to the same wallet, reducing privacy.
Something I do when giving out an address is edit the "label" field so that I know who I gave it to (or what I used it for), and that also makes it clear I have given it out, and next time I should choose one that has no label. Once a trx occurs on the address it ends up in the "used" list anyway, but until the trx it's nice to know it's out there.

Maybe you could have a small void with some grains of sand or tiny balls inside. Shaking makes them assume a random position and squeezing releases some epoxy resin into the void. Once squeezed the grains become fixed in position. 
But how to convert that into a key and address? A cheap webcam chip embedded with controller. It reads the grain pattern and hashes to form a key and address. Now the key is physically fixed but can be read electronically. The void chamber would be directly on the surface of the cam chip. Probably even the act of attaching a sticker to the surface could fix grains of sand in position. It would need a lot of testing and refinement to be sure it always read the pattern consistently even with varying light conditions.

Someone could probably develop a dedicated OS for RaspPi (bootable SD card) that gives you these capabilities. The easy way would be a customized Linux but that's also very hard to fully verify so the ideal solution would be a very small single purpose dedicated (open source) boot image where the entire thing can be audited (much as would be needed for this Entropy device).

Absolutely. According to a Frontline documentary I watched credit cards are already the industry with highest complaint rates at the BBB. Given peoples tolerance for abuse, fees, high interest bait and switch scams and so on, it seems unlikely people will really revolt. I'd love to see that. 
Imagine every credit card owner bought bitcoins to the max and then left the cards completely unpaid as a protest. It's just a thought experiment, people would never be so irresponsible, right? But maybe the world already has the means to throw off the yoke of banker control, bankrupt the system for a new one where they have control - they'll just never do it "because it's wrong". As if that ever stopped the sociopaths in charge.

You can export the private keys for any inputs to another wallet like Electrum and then send the transaction again with fee from that wallet. Assuming the first one has not been confirmed and isn't before this new one then the new one will get confirmed first and cause the original one to be dropped as a double spend attempt. Blockchain.info will resolve this within a couple blocks and the first one will vanish and it will record the second one as good.
@_date: 2014-07-12 14:23:12
When a block is orphaned the trxs in it should get picked up by a subsequent block since they remain unconfirmed. For some reason yours hasn't but it's still out there and could appear in any new block. It just needs a miner to include it.
You could contact the exchange as they have the ability to correct it by re-issuing a trx that uses the same inputs. That would force the original to be a double spend if it ever were picked up later. They may prefer to just let it wait as it's less work for them to fix and adjust their records. I don't think it hurts to make them aware of it and keep tabs on it.
Bad luck. It's like trying to use your ATM card when the system has a screw up and takes it from you.

You can sign a message with a key but that isn't so convenient if all your bitcoins aren't on a single address. Does he really need "proof", as in he doesn't trust you, or just a statement detailing activity and balance. The latter should be fairly easy to print out from whatever wallet you use. Most can export a transaction ledger that would also end with a current balance. 
If you need real actual proof then you can write up a text message and sign it sequentially in turn by each key that has a balance. The main problem with this is that anyone not familiar with Bitcoin isn't really going to know what it means and whether they can trust it.
Anyway, most wallet clients provide a method to sign a message. You type in text and choose a key to sign it with, provide your password and it outputs a block of text that can be verified by anyone that you indeed control the key. They would take the text and check it with a similar but opposite Verify function that needs only the address. 
By chaining an output from one signature as input to next you can prove a series of keys are in your control. Or you sign the same message with each key, print them all, and then they can verify each in turn. Either way.
One final problem with this is that it only proves a lower bound of ownership, and you could easily have more bitcoins in your control that you didn't include. One of the beauties of Bitcoin is it's quite hard to say you own more unless they actually find the keys in your possession. But the above signing process exhibits control/ownership without exposing the actual keys to anyone.
For info on how to sign a message just let us know what wallet you use and someone can help step by step.

I mean the BTC will be transferred from their holding to the ETF holding to back shares owned, but not resulting in market purchases. Of course, the ETF will have to hold BTC because otherwise it would be the equivalent of short selling - if BTC went up in value they would have to make good anyone who sold their fund shares. The ETF becomes a way for them to divest without selling BTC on the market and pushing the price down.

Loyalty cards always depend on the faith of the issuer anyway but this allows the issuer to set terms for expiry and claim back unused credits. The customer can't lose the card as long as they backup/write down the address, or the issuer allows for adding some ID to their copy of the address. eg. enter name, or snap photo of driver license when created, for recovery later.
Also, it allows the issuer to track the liability on their books.

blockchain.info is an excellent wallet site. I've use it myself for a couple years and I'm not aware of any serious security issues. A different league entirely from brainwallet.org.
You'll want to make a wallet backup in case there is access problems in future. Then you can still get to your wallet via the backup. Just remember with Bitcoin - your keys are everything.

I would highly recommend an approach using an Electrum seed and MPK. The MPK can be safely used on the server to generate addresses (see example I gave above), while the seed is safely not on the server. The last place you want keys/seeds is on a web server.
You can run a cron script that queries an online service to for each new block and scan your generated address db against the block to trigger an email with unique download token. This approach requires no blockchain or bitcoind on the server. It's lightweight enough to run on a free openshift / cloud control (PaaS) account combined with a static site.
There is old example code on [github]( and I'm working on a more flexible very small server api for this myself now that will be a backend to a safe self-hosted merchant wallet.

For a small amount of bitcoin you can keep it in the Coinbase wallet as long as you realize that they have custody of your coins. This means it is not truly in your control as they could freeze it, run off with it, lose it to a hack etc. This may be unlikely given they have proven to be reliable and have a good reputation.
For larger amounts it starts to be a more difficult question and you need to ask if you want to accept these risks. Several online exchanges/wallets have failed spectacularly in the past and people have lost their coins.
You can have your own wallet(s) and transfer bitcoins easily from one to the other. Wallets located on your desktop system or mobile phone are also often at risk of hackers due to special virus/trojans/key loggers etc. But you take over full control and don't have risks of freezing or other whims of authority.
Most knowledgeable users of Bitcoin will create an offline wallet for storing long term holdings. Since you don't need access every day it's not much hassle to move funds there. An offline wallet is one printed on paper or created and stored on a computer that has never been connected to the net. Many prefer BIP38 paper wallets and that's a great choice. I use Electrum on a Raspebrry Pi ($35) computer that doubles as my media centre (TV). By swapping it's SD card and disconnecting it becomes offline. There are many favourite ways people around here like to use. The Trezor device is another - being a small hardware wallet which stores funds securely without being net connected.
If you just have a few coins and want to learn more then go ahead and try out some of these ideas. But if you don't want to bother and it's a small amount then just leave them on Coinbase. One of the fun things you can play with is a mobile phone wallet like Mycellium. It even has a "Local trader" feature where you can buy/sell with people directly in your area. 
There are many Bitcoin exchanges in various countries which people use to trade. The price of Bitcoin is entirely market based, like corn or soy beans, so varies based on supply and demand, and speculation is a major factor. The price is typically very volatile (moves up and down a lot), often having dull periods followed by explosions and then falls as the excitement wanes. Some like to trade, or gamble, play the game, but also many just hold and like to watch the whole thing mature and focus on the technology and where it's heading.
@_date: 2014-06-27 12:12:02
The message, signature text and address are enough. Adding the balances and a total probably is a good idea. Another thing, if you send all your btc to a single address in your wallet then you just need to sign once and state the balance, and it's much easier to verify (can be done by anyone on blockchain.info). Much simpler but assumes you don't mind consolidating and having them all on one address.
If you use the same message text for every address then you would only need to state it once at the top and have only two columns.

Someone could make a feedback bot. When you post an item for sale, or WTB, it sees it and posts a feedback info record. When a trade occurs the bot can be called leaving feedback, eg. +1 "great trade would do again", or fb requested for a user. Of course, you'd have to trust the owner of the bot and it would have to have smart rules and be able to verify trxs. Probably would need to be run by some escrow agent of some sort. It's pretty much similar to the OTC market (is that still going?).

There is no message stored in the blockchain. The message you read is created and stored on the explorer web site only. You should go learn about the protocol. blockchain.info is simply an explorer app running on top of the protocol but it doesn't send the message anywhere. It just stores it in it's own database for it's own users. If you view the blockchain on another explorer it can't show you the message. How I know this is I'm a developer who has read the source code and written apps to parse block data.

Or maybe it's not a chain but a distributed tree structure. Each leaf is redundantly stored but only considered valid if it has X number of trusted signatures, similar to confirmations.

Is there an open description of how the confidence is determined? If so, does it depend on a massively connected node to evaluate whether the trx is well propagated?

You mean they're paying 10 cents for each transaction - and that transaction could have hundreds of outputs. 
If you ask me blockchain explorers could cut this out simply by only showing text messages when a certain minimum value is transacted. The message isn't part of the protocol so why should they pay to store and show messages when it's for such trivial reasons.

The device could generate and print the password, with instructions, which the user then cuts off and stores separately or memorizes. Not ideal but an option.

For a decent programmer, relatively easy. I don't know if there are any drop in widgets for this on Wordpress but certainly a bit of python coding can achieve it.

As far as I know the lender simply gets a fee / interest on the loan. I don't think he sees a difference when it's sold. Well, except if borrowed longer he gets more days of interest.
The short seller can add more float cash to hold his position. With deep pockets he could hold it off quite long. But if he doesn't cover his "loss" (difference between price he borrowed at and current price) then the exchange will issue a margin call and soon after use his float to buy back btc to return to lender. That is the "squeeze", where he has no choice but to buy bitcoins.

IP isn't really relevant as it is not contained in the data. You probably need address as unique identifier but it would depend on what you intended to show and how.. The advanced way to do this would be running a full bitcoin node and making api calls on that. It's not hard to set that up and code it. (I no longer have one running here or I could easily dump the data you need)
A simpler approach if you wanted to use blockchain.info is to use their "block" api not the address one. Each block can be requested and then parsed fairly easily. 
I have some python code here for that I wrote for something last year that can access data using either method. You start at block 0 and step through the chain where each block has a time stamp and a list of transactions in that block. Each block (or group of blocks) could become one frame in your animation (depending on desired length and frame rate etc).
We're on block 324716 now so that's still a fair number even at the limit of 700 per 5 minutes. (quick calc, that's 39 hours to grab) They have an api code request process (which I have not tried) to override the limit.

If you had an unecrypted old copy of the wallet.dat sitting around then the malware didn't need the password.
If your node fell behind or was stopped/disabled in background then you wouldn't have noticed the loss until now. It's also possible the malware had no opportunity to send the recovered keys until recently, or that the crook didn't realize they had actually found an unencrypted wallet.dat until recently.

This seems like kind of a naive and slow approach to doing this. From what I recall with using vanitygenocl it could gen addresses much faster than 1000 per second. And there should be no need to use bitcoind at all. There's only 3 million addresses with a balance. A smarter way would be to modify vanitygen to load those 3 million addresses in a tree in memory and then scan that tree for each test address it generates. You only really need to check the top 500K addresses ~0.1 btc or more.

Be aware that the private key you imported now exists on your system with Electrum. I don't know if you gave the wallet a password (encrypted) but if not then it is exposed (to a virus etc). So you'd want to decide how to clean up now - whether to continue using Electrum or wipe it and continue on blockchain.info. It looks like your change output went back to the original address, which should be fine.
@_date: 2014-09-29 03:55:50
If I recall correctly there is an output section which has the keys that are held in reserve for future use. I don't recall what terminology they label those with. If they weren't active (didn't have addresses yet), then I guess you would have to look at those keys to see "future" addresses and the ones you were using would be amongst them. So look for that section of approx. 100 keys and try to generate the address for each. bitaddress.org can help do that. How easy that is will depend on how many transactions you've done over the last couple years. It's also possible that old wallet.dat is not even the same one as your recently active one but if you want to know for sure you'd have to check amongst all the keys reserved in it.

Some thoughts:
* the tree could be recursive/fractal structured, a node being an index entry or a link to another tree
* tree-stores would try to optimize for best quality taking into account signatures and feedback/reputation/utility
* indexers that produce consistent good entries will get added to tree-stores, others dropped
* reward is for indexing, signing (verifying), providing tree-storage and responding to queries
* some sort of market/feedback mechanism to determine allocation so that network nodes can decide how much indexing/verifying/storing they choose to contribute - they may specialize
* an index entry would be the data that a query engine needs to match against search terms
* a search request may decide network nodes to ask depending on a burned coin stake ie. put up a bond that you will perform, let results determine repeat usage

After I posted that I decided it wasn't a good idea anyway. Better to not even have the key with you in a place like that to avoid both the urge to spend and the rubber hose. Not to mention I personally wouldn't want a tattoo.  I would work out a few redundant long term places to hide a BIP38 key and then just rely on memorizing a modest password.

You can and should have many addresses. They are just "end points" for transactions so not usually associated with your identity. They can be associated if you put an address on a web page or tag it along with ID info, but that's generally considered a poor practice. It works, but has some down sides.
The blockchain ledger is fully public so having addresses associated with you means people can see transactions you have done and balances on these addresses. The best practice is to generate an address for each use, and not link it with your identity. In this case the blockchain doesn't reveal personal info (but people you deal with still know the address is yours obviously). Most good wallets today are HD (not high def, but hierarchical deterministic) which means they can generate any number of addresses from a single "seed" value. In this type of wallet the seed is the **critical value** you need to backup and keep safe, and key/address pairs are created as needed from the seed. Hierarchical implies that it can have accounts and  sub-accounts, though often one is only used, and deterministic means it uses an algorithm to derive keys from the seed value.
Trezor, Electrum, Mycelium and many more all support this type of "modern" usage. By safely backing up the seed "phrase" (or hex value) you can restore dozens, hundreds or any number of key/addresses pairs derived from the seed (like a key chain you could say). The generated key pairs actually behave exactly the same as if created individually but since they are so easy to manage, it becomes practical to use a new one for each transaction, making privacy much easier to manage.

Normally an HD seed is just a random number so there's nothing to stop it being derived entirely from the parts making up a multisig wallet. The problem is only if you want to do this without exposing the seed value to any one of the part holders, which would nullify any independence. 
You could use a scheme similar to the third party vanity address gen scheme where public keys are combined to create a new secret private key. Each party would keep their private key safe but provide the public key to be combined (EC add/multiply) to create a master public key (MPK). This can be used to generate addresses which can only be spent by combining all users private keys ("key chain"). (I don't think an M of N scheme is possible this way).
Once you have the MPK you can generate addresses easily as needed - only some hashing and a single EC pt multiply operation (tools are around for this).
Keep in mind the address balances are only related to the original multisig but not controlled by the multisig process. To spend you need to combine the private keys to form a master private key, which can generate derived keys matching the addresses. Also, it's a one-time process - once the master key is derived and used you cannot re-use it securely. You would need to sweep funds to a new "key chain".
I'm not aware of any tools for doing these steps but it should be relatively easy to write them up to work with existing BIP32 tools.

You could figure an upper bound. Add up set of addresses in use which were only sent to once and had no activity again, and probably more than a year ago, That's not rigid but it probably is in the ball park. Maybe a table of oldest unmoved coins, and then choose various cut-off periods.

Not necessarily a blockchain. More like a protocol for distributed scoring / sourcing of referral data. Lets say you index a page (link) or document (content stored) to a set of terms with scores. Combined with a multi-sig transaction model that releases and returns the referred data when each agent has it's conditions met. How the scoring, storage and matching of data is done could vary and through a feedback/reputation system may weed out poor methodology and reward usable results.
I'm thinking if you enter search terms and media type you may get back a sorted list of hits, scores and costs. That could be filtered by past success, either locally and/or collectively. It may not be as general purpose as Google, but it may work to some extent and through refinement over time approach the utility of a general search engine.

Being able to sign with a key does demonstrate having control of the btc but in scenarios like embezzlement there is the opportunity to copy keys allowing ability to control btc even when you no longer shouldn't be able. A CFO could head off to Brazil and once there move all the btc into new addresses - no bank to stop him or return funds. Additional controls will be needed. A business will want to work this out and probably rely heavily on  multi-signature addresses, ie. 2 of 3 need to sign to spend.

According to that BIP the comment section in the user agent is implementation defined. That appears to imply that any node could include a donation address without breaking any rules. To build a tool like the oniontip one could simply use a regex to extract any btc address from a user agent string and traverse the network capturing addresses. Then it simply depends on individual node operators deciding to modify their user agent string to have a btc address in the comment. If there is a donation pool sitting ready then that would probably be incentive enough for those not worried about linking a btc address to their IP.

This sounds totally abhorrent for Bitcoin. It sounds like you're saying you'd go to your bank and buy Realcoins - easily, because your bank **is** totally into that. And once you have Realcoin you could move them around quickly and easily, and maybe go buy Bitcoin on some decentralized exchange - because everyone trusts that some bank has the actual underlying asset locked down. But if the Realcoins are easy to move around then a lot, if not most, people will just use them and not bother with Bitcoin anyway. And if they're managed by banks by being backed in their vaults then how is that different from just using banks as people do now? So it uses a Realcoin transfer protocol instead of ACH? I just cannot see banks getting behind this without also wanting to control who can send what to where - in fact, it would be very quick that regulators would want to clamp down on it unless it's tracked in detail. USD funds held by some entity could become seized and cripple the whole system (just like LR), but even worse the world is once again back to TRUSTING that banks have what they say they do in their vaults - the core of money problems ever since "paper slips for gold on deposit" (and similar to trusting that banks are offering you a great mortgage-backed security). In fact, why not just make GoldCoin and everyone can trade slips of digital ether for Gold ETF holdings. GoldMoney tried something similar and quickly had to backtrack on that.
It sounds to me like some bankers sat down with Brock and discussed how they could usurp and gain control over this new-fangled idea called Bitcoin.

There is a utility online called pywallet. If you get that and use it to dump (json text) your wallet.dat without entering a password then so could anyone who managed to get the file. The dump will have your keys/addresses and you can check if they are the same ones that had your balance.
Another easier option - I think the blockchain.info wallet can import a wallet.dat file. Maybe. I'm not sure now but if it does then you could import it there and if you can see the addresses in question (without providing a pwd) then same conclusion.

I suspect that when the US govt  froze their funds last year they started selling BTC off to maintain fiat liquidity. They knew that not being able to do withdraws would shut them down fast, but increasing delays and hassles would allow them to get by. Now we've reached the point where lack of BTC on hand is causing them to scramble, taking more time to maintain the facade. The approaching result is that most remaining account funds will be realizable dependent on US govt determinations on those frozen funds.

I think you could make it so that squeezing would close two contacts and apply power. So it would use none until you need to "read" it. An LED typically uses 10mA and the uCtrl even less. The LED would not be on 100% so it would use on average only 5mA while squeezed for a few seconds. I don't recall off hand how many mAh a button cell holds but I'd guess you would get at least a few hundred uses. 
My main stumbling block with this is confirming if the key was read correctly. The device can't tell and it can't depend on the user to confirm. Once the LED flashes the key it has to reset even if the reader may have had a problem.

Coinbase isn't even a real exchange. It's not bad for buying BTC but after that you should move it to a real exchange where you can buy/sell in an instant at market prices. Real exchanges will allow you to trade any amount, effectively getting money out at a given price, and only later when you withdraw (fiat) funds to a bank do you deal with delays and hassles with the banking system. On a real exhange you set the price for your trade and are not dependent on what the exchange offer rate is.

What would stop you from selling them. 15,000 btc traded today on bitstamp alone and that's only one exchange. Is it that you don't believe it's real? Go try to sell some to test it out. You can buy them back again. The way the price bounces around you may even come out ahead slightly.
How you store them is up to you. You have the power. What is small/medium depends on you. I personally store anything more than 1 btc on an offline wallet using Electrum. But a paper wallet is good. I would say online wallets are not all created equal so you need to research a bit how much you trust them and how much you can afford to risk for the convenience.

I haven't read enough about U2F yet. It could make no sense. I did think about OTP a bit and see now it would be useless for Electrum or Keepassx. In any case where you have an encrypted local database having a OTP as barrier doesn't help (the file is already available). But doing HMAC challenge response can be used to generate the encryption key and Keepassx has a pull request on Github that someone is using successfully for that. 
My initial understanding was that the U2F has a private key store internally and can be used in some challenge response way, which may allow it to fit into a database encryption scenario without a server. It's a bit unclear as I read that there are two levels of FIDO where a basic one does not store keys and a more full one does.
Since there is working Yubikey challenge response for Keepassx it could be adapted into Electrum. It varies the encryption key for each db save based off the Yubikey response. My main problem is I'm a cheap bastard and don't want to spend $25 when the U2F key may work for $6. In truth you can double those numbers as typically you want a backup key in case of damage/loss. 
If it turns out a U2F key cannot do a form of local challenge response then I'd be interested in adapting the Keepassx Yubikey code for Electrum, but would still need to get at least one Yubukey for testing. It would be pretty great if Electrum was safe from key loggers on desktops. I want this for Keepassx anyway as I store hundreds of passwords locally (excepting my offline Electrum on purpose) and my main worry is still a local threat like a key logger.

You have attempted to spend the same outputs twice. Only one of those trxs will be accepted by a miner and be confirmed.
You cannot **actually** double spend, you can only trick some recipient into believing temporarily that you paid them when you haven't because after a block or few the network will resolve your attempt and correct it.

You only need the address for mining not the private key. The problem is that most mining pools do not disperse shares directly from the generation (coinbase) transaction, so for most pools you would get some mix of non-virgin coins. As mentioned above Eligius and P2pool both directly split the coinbase into shares paid. The downside is this takes 120 confirmations before they can be spent (unless that was changed, I haven't really followed it). In any case whether you or someone else mines, the coins go to an address provided.
If you wanted to provide a service selling virgin coins then you would accept a customer's address and mine to that address for them. If you wanted to pre-mine such that they can just buy them (without waiting) then they have to trust you as any split key method would requires they provide a public key such that you generate a shared private key that is trustworthy. In which case why not just mine to their address.

You cannot successfully do it. That's the whole point of the Bitcoin network.
But attempting to do that can **re-write** a stuck transaction which is what I thought you wanted to do originally - you had a transaction without fees that was not being confirmed and you wanted to send it again with fees to get it confirmed, rather than wait for a long time for either confirmation or discarding.

If an old wallet.dat did not have encryption then that is your problem right there. Someone only needed to find that file to get your coins. No password needed.
A wallet.dat is literally keys to your money. The transaction data doesn't matter. Only that a set of unencrypted keys was sitting on your system.
When a wallet.dat is created it contains a block of the first 100 keys. This means even the keys for future new addresses are already embedded in the wallet at the time it is created. Even if you encrypt later you left an open copy of keys laying around.
Always "securely wipe" any open copy of the wallet. I'm surprised you didn't read about this in all the time since it was discussed often when encryption was implemented. Google about "secure wipe data" for future reference.

As replied already, it's the Master Public Key. Just a 64 digit hex string that you can get from an Electrum wallet (menu: Wallet, Master Public Key). It's derived from the wallet seed value and allows creating any number of addresses tied to that seed, but not the private keys. Since the private keys never exist on the server no hacker can get in and steal them. 
Generating new addresses is safe and very easy this way and that makes this useful for web servers. A single "elliptic curve point multiply" is used to generate a public key from the MPK, and then that is converted into a new address (which requires a couple hash functions).

@_date: 2014-12-15 08:37:52
No. "Key" is probably the best analogy itself. If the address is like a "safety deposit box" then the key allows access to the box (ie. spending from the box). Someone sends (any amount of) btc to an address by creating a transaction in the blockchain. Due to the special relationship between a key and address, when created, only the key can be used to send btc from (out of) an address. Anyone can view the btc sitting on the address, but only the key holder can sign a transaction from the address. This is enforced by the math behind key/address creation and the miners, who check each transaction is mathematically valid.
Anyone can create a key/address "matched pair" but that itself does not do anything except generate a "super big number". It is the step of creating a valid transaction that puts some value into the "box" which only the key can "open". The beauty is that you can give anyone the address and they cannot reverse it to get the key. But you have the key, which allows spending from the address. A wallet can generate any number of key/address pairs, give out the addresses, but restrict the keys. 
Bitcoins are truly "virtual" in that they have no separate location in themselves. They are merely transactions in the blockchain ledger in the form of inputs to an address and outputs from an address. The critical step in all this is that these transactions need to be "signed" by the right key, and this signature can be verified by anyone even without the key, but only created by using the key.
You cannot create multiple keys for the same box, but there are special "multi-sig" boxes that require more than one key to open.

I noticed that as well, and I hope it will eventually show up in a user chosen currency, whether that be btc or USD or Thai Baht. Some control over how conversion is done as well, either by seller or buyer. The most important thing is that the seller can choose a fixed value in his choice of currency because being restricted to btc under current volatilities is a no-go for any serious selling. It's more than just an interface issue - it needs to be in the contract what currency settlement is valued and btc cannot be the underlying contract value.

Due to poor regulation and control it wouldn't surprise me if MtGox was able to do short selling on their own exchange. It would be risky but they have quite a bit of internal control over how it plays out. Sell customers BTC, announce suspension, wait for drop, buy back customers BTC. No one can actually remove BTC in the suspension so they protect themselves from not having enough on hand. 
Maybe what we just saw was them finishing their testing and now knowing they can re-open tomorrow, they cover their borrowed BTC.

If you're talking about number of outputs in a transaction I don't believe there is a coded limit. How many have been tried or can be done without reaching a size limit I'm not sure. I had a quick look at the bitcoin-qt source code and it uses a list to encode the outputs, meaning it's not some fixed size. If there is somewhere else in the protocol a transaction size limit that would probably determine how many outputs can be added. You do pay a higher fee for larger transactions.

Bitcoins can "exist" outside the blockchain - just not safely. Take any of the current exchanges today. They hold BTC balances in ledger entries and have a consolidated offline cold storage. If that offline amount doesn't match the sum of deposits on the ledger then you have room for corrupt use. As long as users don't require auditing of actual BTC holdings, exchanges (or banks) could play many ways with the holdings in the same way they did with gold when it backed paper bills.

You don't even need to embed it in the blockchain. You could just use the blockchain as is.
Remember a few block  Then take those block hashes and sha256 them together. Include a password if you like. Now use the output as a key.
To crack that someone would have to select the group of block hashes you chose and encode them the same way. They could be arranged in any order so that means 350,000^3 (say, we're using 3 hashes), or roughly 56 bits of entropy. 
Of course, this is just a tongue in cheek example. You could remember just one block# and use several hashes from the merkle tree, or transactions. Looking at it that way the search space is much larger, and the memory demand much shorter, especially if the block is linked to some important date/time.
Write down the block # so it looks like a GPS co-ord and you'll have someone digging in the desert for your treasure.  
edit: Also, it need not be a key. The result could be a seed. Remember a while back someone was asking about how to store a wallet for 20 years? This is it. If the blockchain still exists, then your key still exists.

There's no need to even write them to file, though I guess you could if you want to recheck them again later. It's probably faster to gen new addresses than to read old ones from file. Not sure about that.
I recall vanitygen doing about 20 million addresses /sec on my 5830. I'm pretty sure even on a modest pc you can check almost that many per second, much faster than loading from file. I think vanitygen can't output them from the GPU that fast so it's rate is likely much slower when you want to get each one to check. So that would be what limits it overall.
The way I would do this, without using bitcoind, is to get the most recent bootstrap file and run blockparser on it to output a list of addresses with a balance (you don't care about old or future ones). There is an full address list posted online already up to Jan3/2014 so that's even easier (no need for 20G of data). Then run a python script that gets each block (from blockchain.info is easy) to add/remove addresses that have changed. So now it's an up to date list.
Then run a modified vanitygen that loads the list into RAM indexed as a tree for fast lookup, and scan addresses as it generates them. Ideally you would add a signal to vanitygen so it can update the list (add/remove addresses) every new block. That would be much faster than killing it every time a new block is found. Also, you can run multiple GPUs with vanitygen and check them in parallel. You really should be able to check millions per second.

You could generate addresses in a pool of size equal to gap limit and then update the pool by triggering on received payments. This wouldn't be perfect but would reduce reuse without being open to an attack that generates beyond the gap limit. You need to monitor payments anyway so it wouldn't be much work to remove the address from the pool. It would make the code fairly simple for a plugin/extension.

I think he's talking about this current trend of saying the blockchain technology is awesome if we could just have it without bitcoins in it - you know let's have a blockchain run by banks full of registered fiat transactions where users are fully known. You need the mining mechanism and actual creation of bitcoins to make it secure - so without that creation/distribution there is no blockchain - it's useless. You can't have half the system.
My take is that for many mainstream thinkers they need this stepping stone of saying, "well, the blockchain is cool but a new currency we can do without", before they can finally take that next step of realizing they go together. Eventually they have to figure out you can't have your cake and eat it.

Calculating the hashes only benefits the security of blockchain data.
Calculating the hash of a given set of transaction records means that we can determine quickly if any of the records have been changed and reject those changed records. Part of that hashed record is the previous block's hash, thus making a chain of records.
We could calculate the hash only once to verify the records. We repeat it over and over in mining to create a competition in selecting who will receive the reward for the computation. This creates a randomness that distributes the control of building the blockchain. This ensures that one "privileged" miner cannot censor/control the blockchain. 
Every node in the network can verify each new block is valid, by hashing just once, but the competition to create the block ensures it is not censurable.

As an example, right now on bitstamp it says you can move the price to $398 with a 2990 btc BUY. Right now it's $369, so that's a $29 price move @ 13 million btc total. That means a purchase of $1,190,020 raised the market cap by $29x13M = $377,000,000. For a moment anyway, as the absence of more market orders would cause the price to fall back to near $369. The market cap does not reflect the total money paid in to the market but only it's theoretical value if the market remains undisturbed.

There's probably some way of inserting header bytes into packets such that nodes handling the packets can strip and combine the bytes to form a private key as pmt. If the Tor client (or wrapper) sees increased speed it continues to insert key info. If it doesn't then it changes routing or doesn't include the key data. I don't know how the data would be shared by nodes in the circuit but someone smarter and more knowledgeable in Tor could likely figure out some way to combine it into the existing onion layers. It would need some negotiation sequence to form a contract.

I believe it verifies your info is included in the total. If people who have a balance try to verify their info and it fails then they know they were not counted in the total, and can disclose this failure. This tool doesn't check the blockchain. The exchange would post separate proof that their blockchain holdings are sufficient for the total expected.
The problem I see is that people could claim to have a deposit that is missing without actually having one. So they would need to prove they did deposit funds and may not want to disclose their balance publicly. Otherwise this could be used to tarnish an exchange that is holding legit funds.

But we don't want to deal with looking at real addresses otherwise this doesn't solve the problem. In 99% of cases I never type a bitcoin address into anywhere. It's always copy/paste or QR codes.
Why not add a checksum digit to the number? Would 1 digit be enough to detect anything but very rare typos? I'm not sure how to calc that. If the last digit makes the sum of digits equal zero then you would need to mistype 2 or more digits such that they still sum to zero. ah, but this doesn't help for reversed digits. So you would need an order dependent checksum method.

Seems they're copying Mycelium with a dumbed down approach. This allows them to not have to monitor more than 1 unused address.

Mycelium does allow adding new accounts based off the seed, which I have not tested, but presumably that would allow generating at least one new address for each account.

Mining serves as proof of work. The necessary hash calculations could be done only once and in a fraction of a second, but the repetition with a special outcome proves work was done. This distributes the control of block creation (it becomes a lottery) and makes sure that no "privileged" miner can take over, which is a vitally important function in Bitcoin. 
There are several aspects to doing external work that make it hard to implement. 
1. The result of that work must be something which could be checked easily as having uniquely occurred given the input conditions, otherwise you cannot verify it was done.
2. The result must be incorporated into the block created, and verified by all nodes, not just miners. The network is open and code is freely editable so any external work would be removed by miners if possible, and computing power diverted to multiple instances doing only required work (reverting back to what we have now).
3. Work not securing the blockchain is not something bitcoin users should be forced into subsidizing. Bitcoin users pay the fees and suffer the inflationary aspects of the reward, and from their perspective it is money wasted if not applied to network security.
There have been several external-work coins but they have not gained much footing. If coin users valued that function more than security then they could choose to use those coins.

You can export the private key from QT and import it into Electrum. If you do that I'd suggest then sending to a native seed derived address in Electrum after. This is just so you only need the seed phrase as your backup and not worry about the wallet file itself, or any exposure of the key. 
Electrum is quick to install and doesn't need to download the blockchain, but it's main strength is all keys are based on the single seed. It has nice support for offline trx signing as well.

Not likely unless he managed some unusual deal. I don't know what commercial rates would be but regular rates are fairly high. Around USD $0.14 / kWH now. It's probably convenience (lives near Bkk), or some funky situation. Lots of weird stuff happens. It's not uncommon for a meter to be overloaded, blow up and not get fixed for over a year. They just short the meter out until it's fixed. But that's just for a single house, so I couldn't even guess for large buildings.

I'm not a Schildbach wallet user but a quick look at their github turned up this info about recovery where it talks about recovering when a phone device is destroyed. 
Since you have the backup file it looks like it's encrypted with openssl and you can follow the decrypting steps given there. Once decrypted you have a file in protobuf format and there is a java tool for dumping it.

[Electrum]( is open source python code hosted on github and forked by currently 273 users. That means there is 273 public copies of the code on github alone. You could go copy it right now and save it on your own. As long as you have that code, even if the original vanishes, you can access your coins. 
The actual important code is also quite short - less than a page. The whole thing reduces to a dozen or so lines of EC math / SHA256 functions to generate keys from a seed. If that gets proven bad then unfortunately the whole crypto world crashes down.

Once Electrum is installed it will create a wallet on first run. Save your seed phrase if you plan to ever use the wallet again. On blockchain.info you would export the private keys related to the stuck transaction (ie. the private keys for the input addresses, not including the dust one). Then in Electrum import those keys and they will show in the wallet, along with the available balance. Since they are not used in any seen trx in this wallet you can click the send tab and enter the address you want to send to and the amount. It should add a suitable fee and once sent it should confirm as usual. The old stuck trx will eventually be dropped entirely (as double spent).
Note that any change returned from your trx will go to a change address in the Electrum wallet. So don't just delete the wallet after.

This is true. I live in a "developing nation", where people work 12 hours for $7/day, and smart phones are very common now even amongst people who cannot afford them. A few things everyone buys here - TV, nice phone, nice clothes, and for some weird reason, satellite dishes. Seriously, most of the homes in this small, poor village have them. People here aren't blocked from using Bitcoin due to not having a phone. It's because they've never heard of it, and probably wouldn't trust it even if they had.

One thing better than making a fee for translation is getting a cut of everyone else making a fee for translation.

I don't think they start out with that in mind. More like they want to shut down, get out, and then find out after, well, there is some interest in taking it over.

I've been thinking of writing a Bluetooth plugin expressly for passing unsigned and signed trx between desktop and Raspberry Pi Electrums. Seeing what they did with AirBitz made me think this is workable and would make offline signing easy.

No one has mentioned it so I will: **Electrum**. Light, fully featured, secure, easy to use. Not a lot of docs but fairly easy to get going and no blockchain download. Looked over and trusted by many long-time bitcoiners, and easy to get help on the forums. Excellent for both offline highly secure and online convenience. Make sure you check it out before deciding.
You can run it on a standalone offline system, create the offline wallet, then copy the MPK (master public key) to your connected system so you can monitor it online without risk. If you need to spend funds from the offline wallet (eg. to refill a daily use wallet) then it has a secure process for creating a trx online, signing it offline and returning online to send without exposing your keys. Since it uses a **seed** you only need those 12 words as backup for your whole wallet.
It's only failing IMO is that it really doesn't have a satisfactory Android app.

I'm not running a node right now but I did last year. I believe you will want a VPS with something like:
**1GB RAM** (pretty much decides VPS plan cost)
**30GB hard disk space** (that allows some growing room)
**50-100 GB data xfer** (most offer more in this price range)
Many VPS offerings like this will run around $7-10 or so. If there is a firewall you would need to open a port 8333 (if i recall correctly).
I'm not aware of any way to earn some kharma but you could run an info / api site on top using something like the bitpay code and then run adverts to give you some small income. It might pay for some of the hosting.
You could run an Electrum server on top as well. There's already quite a few but I guess more is better and that's a useful service. When you do that you provide a console message which allows you to beg for donations. I did that but never got any so your mileage may vary.

GPUs stopped being profitable over 18 months ago, and even before that they were barely worthwhile for another 12 months. Even now ASICs are only profitable if they are the latest gen and deployed in bulk in low-rate electric areas, and with low capital costs. If you want to be a part of Bitcoin growth with little money then your best bet is just buying bitcoins and holding until after 2016 when the supply rate halves.

The site cannot do this. It would need to store the users seed on the server to use it for the next user. That would provide the site owner with access to all wallets generated. 
It should use mouse movements as seed value and ask the user to randomly move the mouse before clicking - this is how bitaddress.org and some other sites do it. 
Alternately (and maybe less secure) it could request a value from random.org (which specialises in true random numbers derived from atmospheric noise). I say less secure only because someone monitoring traffic could scoop up that reply and know the seed.

Phone credits are used in many countries, though probably to a lesser extent. Here in Thailand it's not uncommon to trade credits. And there are ATM like phone credit dispensers everywhere. If a local phone company like AIS, DTAC offered bitcoin convertibility the phenomenon could expand to international trade fairly easily. I don't know that they have incentives for that. Possibly for taking a cut of online shopping they'd be interested. They have a wide dealer network (including 7-11) with easy access so offering some exchange function would be very forward thinking.

288,242 addresses have 1 btc or more.

You cannot get any real indication of adoption rate from that as any user could have any number of addresses. Sometimes the reverse holds as well - one address could hold many users combined balances. It is possible to have more users than addresses.

This really depends what kind of "interacting" you want to do. Write an Android app, make a web site, program for a specific OS or what not. Javascript is good if you want to create a web app where the smarts run in the user's browser. At the server end you could use Javascript but there's many other topics you would need to be familiar with and it's not a typical choice. It's a good language to know, generally speaking. 
For Android apps you would learn Java not Javascript, though it is possible to write HTML based apps using Javascript.

19697 GH/s on a GPU on a laptop? I think you have some numbers wrong. Maybe you mean KH/s?
In any case to answer your question it will take a really long time to make 0.01 BTC on a laptop (never if you count electricity cost). The current total network rate is 280,580,115 GH/s so divide your rate into that and multiply by 25 for 10 minute btc rate. If you are doing 19697 GH that's 0.252 btc/day. More likely you are doing 0.000000252 /day. ie. 39682 days for 0.01 btc.
See here,  and plug your numbers in but then subtract electricity costs.
If you want to know what you need to make money now, see [these google images]( but ignore anything that looks like it's in a bedroom...

Regarding  It's such a hard question to properly make sense of. I bet you could also ask them if they have ever lost cash. A lot of early bitcoin users didn't treat their wallets as having any value and regularly lost them or wiped them by mistake. And then there's a been a steep learning curve for more non-tech users as many didn't take seriously that they needed backups. Combine that with a real wild-west attitude as users did stupid things with their coins like lending them to get rich quick schemes, crappy web wallets and exchanges. It's definitely been a rocky road and it's so good to finally be getting some competent well funded start ups on the scene.

This isn't so. The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks, to ensure that blocks are created at near steady pace. Difficulty can go down as well as up. It has been going up because of faster, cheaper, more efficient hashing technology (ASIC chips) has been coming online. But just as a few years ago when GPUs came online difficulty rose, and mining eventually became saturated, then difficulty plateaued and dropped. 
The relationship between difficulty and mining power utilizes a feedback loop. When hashing becomes too fast the difficulty increases to slow it down. When difficulty becomes too high and unprofitable, miners drop out, cutting hash rate, which lowers difficulty again. 
Shocks like new tech cause large disruptions but the long term trend is always towards minimal **acceptable** profit for miners, maximizing security for available tech and network cost. This current cycle started back in January 2013 when Avalon ASICs shipped out (after more than 6 months of eager waiting). Since then the chip die size has dropped a few times and ASICs are far faster, less power consuming then that first batch. 
Mining can only be profitable long term for those with the best tech, lowest electric cost, and cheapest access to capital but disruptions can give opportunity to those quick to adjust, which is why so many are angry over scams like Butterfly Labs.

Yes, that's true. Even 1 minute intervals would be more than adequate and if you did manage to use the same address twice in a minute it wouldn't be catastrophic, just non-optimal.

Keep the keys and put an expiry date on the wallets. Anyone who knows what it is, or who learns about it, will know to sweep the key. It's standard practice any time you receive a key with balance.
And it means if only 1 in 10 sweeps the key then you can send the unused btc to the bright kids who did sweep it. After all, you'll be able to see where they swept to.

Using BIP32 the master key is 256 bits but also uses a 256 bit chain code in the deriving of child keys. It uses HMAC-SHA512 based off a seed value that is generally 128 bits long. 
So simply stated it starts with a 128 bit seed, extends it out to 512 bits with SHA512 and cuts it so that one half is a master key and the other half a "chaining" code. Kind of a more complex version of above where you add the chain code instead a fixed value of 1.
The legacy Electrum wallets are not BIP32 and closer to the idea of adding 1 for each key, though they don't use the value 1 - they take a simple set of values and hash that to add.

Anomlaous - I don't think it is. It's what I would expect. Difficulty rises until it's barely profitable and then backs off to a level where the most efficient miners can survive. To get some idea what to expect go back to late 2011 when the btc price was in the doldrums for over 6 months and slowly sank to $2. The difficulty turned down and everyone was talking about how they were getting rid of GPUs and mining was a fools game. And yet if people (me) mined right through that down turn and accumulated cheaper coins, then later they would rake in huge gains. Not that we can say it'll happen again. I'm just saying you should expect difficulty to turn downwards and the less optimistic bitcoiners are, the lower it'll go.

I wanted to use a d16 / hexadice but couldn't get one easily/cheaply where I live. Even d20s here are hard to get as D&amp;D is not popular in this region (Not USA). And then you know only high quality sharp edge dice test well for bias. I even offered to pay someone btc to send me a couple but no takers, and no site I know of that will sell hex dice for btc. Seems like a good product to offer.
Using 4 coins together means that each toss is like a d16 throw. Having a small hex table written down means you can instantly convert the 4 coins into a hex digit. It's not so bad for a one-time seed but I wouldn't want to do it for each 64 digit key.

If you export the key you can import it into any client and set a zero fee when you send. The fee is unrelated to the key but to the value set during the send in your wallet/client. Many client allow zero fees but I'm not sure all do. Electrum is probably a good choice, though I noticed a bug last time I tried changing the fee - it went back to the default. So maybe set the default to 0 will work.
With zero fee you may wait a long time. If you are doing many then you're better to bundle them all in one trx with a fee. eg. Electrum lets you read a list of &lt;address,amount&gt; from a file and combine them as outputs in one trx. (Tools, Create, From CSV)

I've read the FIDO overview doc now and how U2F works at a introductory level. The device does provide for storing keys internally or a cheaper version which encrypts a origin (app?) specific key in a key handle returned to be stored externally. I think either can work for Electrum. It responds to challenges with signed data specific to an origin, which in this case would be an Electrum wallet instead of a web site.
When you first register an Electrum wallet against they device it will generate a "key handle" for that Electrum wallet which is stored in the wallet file (not further encrypted). When the wallet is opened the key handle is provide to the device and signed in response. The wallet seed needs to be based on this signed response. This means you cannot register an existing wallet with a device but must always generate a wallet against a specific device. The problem is that in an insecure environment it is always possible to alter the Electrum code to capture the seed value. So any device offers protection against key loggers but not against any more sophisticated app-specific infection. That seems to be as good as we can get without going to a secure trx signing device.

Each of the little balls is a file, and the clusters are directories, which make up the project.

I turn off the labelling of file names and directories because it gets really messy looking.

Right. There are some optimizations to help ensure being first. You would increase your peer count so that you are listening to more nodes and will "hear" it first. Store your address/key list in a tree in memory. That makes it very fast (only a few byte comparisons) to match. Then, relay the original transaction and your spend directly to several of the biggest pools since they are most likely to mine it and you want them to arrive in correct order and before others.

You could use a BIP38 key (truncated, first 128 bits) as the seed for a wallet. Then print the key and tell the lawyer it's an Electrum seed not a key. That way you get the advantages of a deterministic wallet but the safety of BIP38 encryption. 
This is also another way to create plausible deniability / hidden wallet. Store a few mBTC on the key but use some truncated or manipulated portion as a hidden seed.

So 31357 could be a block number, and 10,16,88 could be trx numbers to hash. This is only one reading and you could interpret it many ways. Here the location and how to read it make up the brain wallet. Like any brain wallet you need to spend some effort to commit it to memory. 
You could use any number sequence in this fashion. A phone # read backwards. Your birthdate in linux time, transposed. The distance to the moon. I guess my point is that a brain wallet need not only be a sequence of words. Anything could form an index into the blockchain.
But I don't think I would use a single hash. It would be very easy to scan those in bulk.

No. With Bitcoin the reward is created in the block from nothing. You cannot do that with USD. They could only collect the fees but the fees for the first 5 years, and even now, are much much less than the reward. Unless you plan to have large fees like $10 each trx, you will not get enough miners to secure anything.

There's absolutely no point in running a centralized blockchain. You may as well just use a SQL DB for the data. The only way having a blockchain makes sense for them without bitcoin as incentive is if they share the responsibility amongst a group of peers - like banks, and other financial companies that all work together as an "association", of sorts. Then they could use the blockchain as a way for every member to have equal shares, control, and transparency. And that would likely not be public. As soon as you go public the blockchain is open to attack and an incentive is required to secure it.

It sounds like all you really need is a very simple web form with form-to-email function that can display a new payment address for each order. I can code that for you and it can be hosted on a free service, backed by an your own Electrum wallet (you keep the seed for security, wallet is not on the server). 
This isn't more than an hours work, since I've mostly done it  already, and I'll help out for no cost. I'll tell you which free service can host a script to do address generation and form-to-mail, and explain how to upload the python script, which I'll give you. It's very easy with no coding skills needed. If you know a bit of html/css then you can spiff it up with images and styling as you wish. I can put the basic script on my github so it can be reviewed and used by anyone.
You will need an email address, Electrum wallet and provide an MPK for address gen. You may want a domain name as well, but that's up to you. One from freedns can work or you can just use the free host's subdomain. 
The two free services I know do not require any sign up info but will likely log your IP address, so you would need to be careful about that if you value privacy. If you get fancy with lots of images and have heavy traffic you may need to move it to a host that offers more and costs something.

The network won't accept a transaction with an invalid address so if they record it as sent that means their system is gorked and they removed funds from your balance without it actually creating a valid blockchain trx. Just ask them for the trx id proving it was actually sent.

There is [Electrum for Android]( It's an older version but they are working on an update after 2.0 that should be much better.
It's still Python so that means installing the scripting layer first. A bit cumbersome and not as pretty as newer apps but I believe it still works.
There was also work on a Kivy version that would provide a native Android version of Electrum. I don't know how that's going. I tried building it but couldn't get a working version to fly.  See,  (kivy branch) but expect a lot of work for that.
With 2.0 there should be some compatibility between other HD wallets and Electrum. It would be nice to be able to share a wallet between the desktop and the phone.

I commented on the other thread as well. I've written code for this and will be posting it on my github before too long but it's not ready for use yet. 
It works like this:
- you plug in an MPK you create off server (with Electrum), and with a single api call you can generate unique addresses for insertion in web pages / checkout etc. Stores addresses in a sqlite db with order/pmt details. Supports either pooled addresses (to comply with gap limit) or sequentially unique addresses.
- daemon that taps a websocket feed of pending trx and new blocks from an external service, either your own or one like blockchain.info or insight - watches for new pmts and matches against sqlite db above to update status. When status is correct (cfms, amount) it triggers whatever action you need to take for payment.
- provides a manager api/web app for viewing status of orders/tokens etc.
- supports multi-merchant use to track many MPKs, and their use, as a service or in a marketplace. So an api call can also add an MPK to the db and associate it with a token for use in scripts that request addresses.
- python source code will be on github and will be easy to clone it on a server and have it independently running in minutes. Can use from any language including client side js.

It would depend on how they secure it, but maybe it's possible to secure. They could hard code all nodes IP but even then with the right attack they could be spoofed. So I guess they would need verified keys for writing acceptable blocks but even then there's a chance of keys being hacked, leaked etc. Maybe it's doable but I wouldn't be keen on a system like that as it nullifies the beauty of the blockchain anyway - which is that it secures itself despite being publicly transparent.

They seem to be talking about "accounts" not addresses, presumably meaning users at web wallets and such. There's really no need to estimate the addresses in use as we can count them in the blockchain - there is about 3.5 million addresses with a non-zero balance (as of today). Your argument about having 10 addresses yourself is correct, as I do also have about that many, but that would only mean that the upper limit on users is 350,000. Except that many, in fact most users, use Coinbase and similar "accounts" where their coins are consolidated into only a few addresses. Which brings us back to estimating users being non-related to address count itself.

The same openness which provides for public accountability is exactly what lobbyists and powerful interests require to ensure that their money is well spent on congressmen. 
The transparency is much more useful to powerful interests since they can afford to pay for provable results as compared to the general public who aren't able to understand the complexity of the legislation being produced, nor able to afford to change outcomes.
I don't know why you would doubt that it matters. It's pretty damn obvious when you look at the incentives and trends since the "sunshine laws" were enacted. The congressmen themselves have stated explicitly on the record how it works but are blind to discussing how it should be fixed. And why would they - they benefit hugely by the massive increases in lobbyist funding since those laws.
If you can't be bothered to spend some time finishing it then I'm sure as heck not going to spend time digging up research for you. I'm quite sure it would be pointless anyway.

Going to sound like a broken record here.
Use MPK address gen code in your pmt web page creation and store each address given out in a db. Have another bkgnd process which monitors the db addresses against each new block using blockchain.info (or other site) "getblock" api call (or use a websocket feed). Trigger on suitable payment match to create download token and hand to user, or store in user account if you already maintain that for them.
The MPK (master public key) is generated by Electrum away from your server and pasted in the server code as generator for any number of addresses safely without keeping a wallet on the server.

It's programmability that references the blockchain for validity and truth. Decision making that looks at the blockchain to determine how or if some function should occur. Without the chain of trust given by the blockchain you would not be able to automate the decision to provide a service, or function, because it would require human intervention. The transactions on the blockchain also contain script primitives that affect how the blockchain itself behaves, which integrates with how external programs respond.

Not much to do now, unfortunately.
I created a "key file" plugin for Electrum to thwart key loggers. The key file can be on a usb dongle thus requiring it to be plugged in (2FA)  to allow any spending. Until key loggers get smart enough to also monitor the filesystem for accesses after password entry this should work, and is easier than full offline storage (for suitably smaller amounts).

He says it sat there for months so I'd expect it's the bad RNG. I recall reading before that the site uses the date/time to seed the RNG. That means someone (maybe even the site author) could likely copy the code (javascript I think), and then cycle through date/time seeds until they gen keys that have value on them. I'm guessing it took a few months to hit his and who knows how many others on the way thru. In fact, if it's the site author he can use his server logs to focus on date/times around the logged accesses.

I'd try out using a loyalty card as a "coloured coin" asset tracker. So for example, you maintain the keys and for each coffee they buy you add 1 bit to their address. And when they buy a coffee you remove 1 bit. They can check their balance at any time counted as coffees (bits). For every 10 they buy you add an extra bit free.
I could see it being useful to have an Electrum plugin for this to make a nice simple interface for managing the cards. It could automate free coffees by tracking trx history etc. And allow for printing cards in batches. Or simpler to start you could do it with an mobile wallet like Mycellium, where each account you create is a coffee card.
To get even nicer I could make a simple Android app that provides a super simple coffee card interface, but is really a watch only wallet underneath. It shows you how many coffees you have left, and a QR code when you want to buy/fill up so the barista just points their phone at it to transact. Dead simple because no keys or transactions occur on the phone. (Actually this is a pretty cool idea).
This avoids issues of price volatility and makes it closer to a traditional coffee card where you count coffees and not dollars.
Even better if you have a chain or network of cafes and it works all over town.

I had a look at the Flash Programming manual for this chip. It has good protection levels but unfortunately it still means we have to trust the initial programming.
There are 3 protection levels. According to my reading of the docs:
Level 0 has no read protection. 
Level 1 has read protection via debug/JTAG and forces a mass erase if reset. ie. you would have to reprogram the device and could not see what's in it (code hidden).
Level 2 is also read protected, but cannot be reversed (to levels 0,1). This seems good but even in this mode the internal program can rewrite flash memory, just not via debug/JTAG. So there could be update code present allowing changes. External re-programming (but not option bytes) is still possible if not explicitly turned off.
If you set option for level 2 then you cannot verify the device contents. But if you set level 1 then the device can be mass erased, allowing reprogramming. Write protection is a separate option and presumably would be prevented. In order to verify device code you need Level 0, but that also opens it abusive reprogramming.
This is just a quick reading by me and I could be wrong. It appears the bottom line is in order to read/verify the chip you need to also allow it to be erased/reprogrammed. To prevent an attacker from reprogramming the chip also requires hiding the code, hence, trusting the initial programming.
This seems typical as mostly these devices are designed to protect copyrighted code from being pirated, whereas in this case what is needed is the ability to read/verify code without ability to rewrite it.

You can set a password for Electrum and it will encrypt your seed, requiring password to send. You can also de-seed the wallet and have it as watch only (cannot send until you add the seed again). It also has good support for generating a seed offline and copying the MPK to your desktop so that the seed never exists on a net-connected system. With this method you create the trx on the desktop but sign it offline. All in all Electrum offers several high security options if you use them.

As if a permission slip means you can't commit fraud. There's been just too many examples of that. The only benefit is that permission slips create records for knowing who is who. It's harder to just slip away in the night, or it should be if the permission is recorded and checked properly. They knew who to arrest for Enron but it didn't stop many years of fraud.

It is a plugin. You can enable it or leave it disabled. Even if you enable it you can choose to use the key file button or ignore it. It simply appends a hash of the keyfile onto the password. The password is used to AES encrypt the seed but not generate the seed.
I don't believe there is any process memory protection in Electrum as it's written in Python and even though I've been through much of the code I've never noticed anything like that. It's a good idea that I don't know anything about. Maybe I'll dig around and see if there is a way to implement that for Electrum. I don't know if root is needed for accessing arbitrary memory in Linux but if so then an easier approach would be simply patching the Electrum source with a couple lines that send the seed upon decryption. That would be trivial with root access. 
I have considered writing Electrum seed store and signing code for a PIC microcontroller so that it could be self-built and programmed as a tiny Electrum dongle. I have past experience to do that but so far have not decided to commit the time. It would cost a hobbyist about $2 to make their own. It could work with a plugin for Electrum so that new wallet software need not be written. Use Electrum as watch only wallet (with MPK) that needs special dongle to sign trxs. Dongle optionally gens seed from static ram noise, gives MPK to Electrum via plugin, and signs trxs via plugin.
I know there's Btchip and others but so far I haven't bought in mostly because I just don't really trust them yet. Building my own would be fully self-trusted and some great tech fun. I'd open source it on github if I did.

There's actually only a very small amount of code needed to extract keys from a seed. Here is an example of generating the master public key from a seed. Barely a dozen lines of python. I think the private keys are not much different but this particular code isn't enough. It has the master key but needs to derive the chained ones. Also, this simple code is not for the new HD seeds but the legacy ones.

Electrum, sort of. It will work for the server but on Android it's still only a Python version which is less than completely satisfying. But if you don't mind putting python on Android then it does work.
It's still overall less than perfect in my opinion. Generating addresses for customers can be cumbersome due to the way HD wallets use sequential addresses. You need a large enough gap limit to avoid missing pmts. 
I've been working on an HD merchant API wallet that uses sparse addresses for this purpose. It can generate many addresses, monitor them, notify of trx, and create unsigned trx that need to be validated elsewhere and signed. Due to other work cutting in I'm a bit stalled at the moment, but I will get back to it.

I've wondered for a while if using traffic attacks could lead to locating servers.

Just checked - send online CAD &gt; AUD. Give them $112 and get $99.46.
They charge currency conversion at 0.9946 when according to both Yahoo and XE $1 CAD is worth $1.03 AUD. So they're tagging on 4% in currency loss. Overall it's costing you (103-99.46)+12 = 15.54% to send $100.
When I compare Yahoo to my ATM converted rates it's usually only off by about 0.3% so having a transfer be 4% off is why I never use WU now. Ripped off once (12 years ago) was enough.
BTW I'm not that excited about Bitcoin for remittances in it's immature state today but I am excited about what it could become. Today I view it as the most fun way to send money because you can play the market while sending funds and actually make money doing a transfer. Or lose. But with WU you've got a guaranteed loss before you begin.

You can use a FIDO U2F key. [Amazon sells them for $5.99](
It works with Google and other sites that are starting to support this new "Universal 2 Factor" standard. I believe it self registers upon use but I may be wrong - I haven't got one yet. It looks like a nice low cost, more private solution than Yubikey or GA. Well, yubikey now makes a U2F as well but it costs $18.
BTW If someone wants U2F support for Electrum (or Keepassx, which I also use) I'd love to code support for it and submit as pull request. I'd only need someone to send me one of these cheap things. I'll pay (with btc) but I cannot easily order from Amazon due to my location.

This type of thing has to happen as covering arbitrage across exchanges.

Given many countries have currency controls I think the arbitrage is most likely to be done by people with too much of the local currency who want to move it out/offshore into USD or other hard currencies. I would think there is a demand for that and even a desire to discount but first it has to be trusted. So that will take time, probably years, to seep into regular usage.

I see what you're saying but the idea is that trading a similar amount in USD would have similar effect to what 150 btc does now. A couple years back trading 15,000 btc was around $150k or so, and now it's $6 million. We want to be able to see a few billion USD per day and not have it move much.

Also, vital is the account used to push Electrum to the Ubuntu (or Debian?) repos. I guess that's the launchpad one but I'm not sure about that.
But even beyond that. Any package on Linux that is installed potentially has root access during installation and could be used to change the Python source code in Electrum. It would take a single modified line to capture the seed when being decrypted and post it to a server somewhere, or to mod the seed gen code to create compromised seeds.

Use a key for login. It really depends on the situation. 
You need to assume the public system is compromised and it can connect via the tunnel and send abusive/fake data. The listening end must be able to handle anything and drop it. If events are continuous you could use a tunnel but if they are only occaisional you should probably connect to a pre-set shell to handle data. If it gets something that is wrong it should probably stop listening and flag an alert. Even if valid data, it needs to check it against limits for rate, amount, destination (eg. is the address one that you generate or just some other random one). If you generate the wallet for them, and give them the key, then do not use HD methods (unless hardened) but do make sure you only send to an address for a key you created.
You should probably design in some mechanism where you batch them or manually confirm them as a fall back or for test mode. If unknown data is detected you can fall back to that but be aware it can lead to DOS attacks.
note: I didn't fully research your example briefcase thing so didn't think this through for your usage fully. You'll need to explore all the ways things can go wrong. Above is only very generic suggestions.

A wallet is a managed **collection** of key and addresses. Your wallet will manage them by creating new key/address pairs and using change addresses when needed. Viewing a single address can give misleading results due to how the "change" mechanism works. 
Assuming you are not using some crap/scam wallet then you should believe the wallet balance rather then relying on simply viewing a single address.
If you don't trust the balance provided by your wallet then perhaps sending your remaining balance to a wallet you can trust is a good option. 
On Android the Schildbach, Mycelium, and Blockchain.info wallets all have good reputations, but there are others. It's crucial to stick with ones that are well known, well tested and open source.

Not sure if you're just trolling here. What you say applies to any market - such as the stock market. Bill Gates could manipulate the price of MSFT easily and send it tumbling. Large gold holders could dump on the market and make gold fall quickly. Generally they don't because they're more interested in holding and not destroying value. But with any market the value is determined at the margin. Everybody cannot suddenly sell their MSFT shares and hope to get even a fraction of what they trading for at this moment. And actually the same holds for currency trades as well. If the Chinese govt suddenly started selling USD into the market you'd see exchange rates collapse.

Actually, if MtGox has been taking full advantage of their position then those 750000 we're probably "borrowed" from customers and sold over the many months that the price was always at a premium. Imagine, with Mark's PHP prowess he rigged the pricing engine to always keep the price up higher, while disposing of the btc being held in trust. THIS is the real reason that fiat withdraws were so slow. The longer they could keep them back the longer they could liquidate BTC. No BTC destroyed at all, no scarcity.
Mark probably got the idea from the US Govt. Heck, if they can just freeze MtGox funds at will, then why can't he do the same, and then start his own country with the proceeds.

Cool. 
I did something similar a couple years back. A small python util that takes hex chars and makes a WIF private key. I also did a longer more flexible version but it's less simple to audit. Here's code for anyone interested.
BTW I created my electrum seed by flipping coins, 4 at a time into hex chars. I'd have preferred d16 dice but they're hard to get around here.
     python
    #
    # a simple filter that reads 64 HEX chars on each line stdin and outputs the WIF format on stdout
    # good for bulk conversion of random data into Bitcoin private keys
    # 
    # eg. hexdump -v -e '/1 "%02X"' -n 32 /dev/urandom | hexwif
    
    import sys, binascii, hashlib
    
    for line in sys.stdin:
        line = line[:64]
        alphabet="123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
        chksum = binascii.hexlify(hashlib.sha256(hashlib.sha256(binascii.unhexlify('80'+line)).digest()).digest()[:4])
        bn = long('80'+line+chksum, 16)
        
        out = ""
        while bn &gt;= 58:
            bn,m = divmod(bn, 58)
            out = alphabet[m] + out
        print alphabet[bn] + out

There's really no *problem* here. You need to keep your seed words safe no matter what and it needs to be **redundant**. Anyone who trusts an SD card for storage doesn't know what they're doing. Whether you use a Trezor or RasPi or whatever you should always be thinking about **redundancy** because no piece of hardware or any single file, piece of paper or device is reliable enough. Not ever.

I think Bitcoin Qt hides the "change" addresses in your wallet. Some others like Electrum and blockchain.info show them, or allow you to toggle visibility.
Since your balance is correct you know that address is actually included in your wallet.
This happens because transactions can only be made up of whole "outputs" being spent. Very often the total of outputs is more than you want to send and the extra is returned back to you as "change", into a "change" address.

If you're the handy type and have a drill then:
Use Electrum. View the seed as hex value. 
Mark a grid of 16x16 dots on a small piece of metal with a centre punch.
Sequentially read the hex digits and mark the 1 positions on the dots with a pen.
Drill a small 1/16th hole for each 1 position.
If you want to get tricky then make several with random holes but that only go fully thru when aligned on top of each other. Store separately.

Replace bitcoind wallet above with an MPK and generate addresses from that. The rest works the same but you have Electrum elsewhere with the seed to manage the funds. The code to generate addresses from an MPK is literally a few lines (assuming an ecc library available in your language choice).
Here's an example from a server api I coded recently (python, but equally doable in php):
    def mpkgen(mpk_str, idx):
        mpk = ecdsa.VerifyingKey.from_string( mpk_str, curve = SECP256k1 )
        pubkey = mpk.pubkey.point + seq(idx, 0, str(mpk_str)) * generator_secp256k1
        pub_key_str = '04' + ecdsa.VerifyingKey.from_public_point( pubkey, curve = SECP256k1 ).to_string().encode('hex')
        return public_key_to_address( pub_key_str )
I run this api on a "cloud control" free account to provide addresses on demand for web pages. I was going to post it to my github sometime but haven't got around to it yet. It will have some trx monitoring code when I get a bit more done.

**The First Day in the Life of a Paranoid Bitcoiner**
6:00 am - wake up, have fruit museli with soy milk and mocha.
6:20 am - roll 2 hexadice 16 times to create a 32 hex digit seed value and write down on paper, keep triple safe.
6:22 am - power off my XBMC Raspberry Pi, remove the SD card, attach keyboard and mouse, and replace with new Raspian SD card to boot a clean linux system.
6:25 am - booted up and have Debian desktop on my HD screen. Run commands to install Electrum as described [here]( Disconnect from network and never connect again while booted on this SD card. (If you know the tech details you could even remove networking drivers and binaries).
6:30 am - generate my new wallet with command: 
    electrum -o restore   (-o tells it to stay offline)
enter password, accept defaults, and seed hex digits I rolled earlier. Double check values.
6:31 am - insert USB stick, and save the MPK to take to my desktop system with command:
    electrum getmpk &gt;/path/to/flashstick/mpk.txt
(could also do this instead using notebook webcam to scan MPK and is arguably easier and more secure too)
Optionally get the seed phrase, verify again and write down as extra backup.
    electrum getseed
6:32 am - shut off system and remove SD card to keep safe. Maybe make a backup too. Remove keyboard and mouse, re-insert XBMC SD card and boot to watch TV again.
6:37 am - open notebook and insert USB stick with mpk.txt file. Create a new "watch-only" wallet with desktop gui: File, Restore, copy/paste MPK value. This wallet can be used to send coins safely to the offline wallet and monitor balance. Send a few mBTC to the new wallet from my ChangeTip account - copy/paste address, click send. Watch it come in. Nice.
6:40 am - go for a motorcycle ride and get a bagel and coffee.
10:30 am - Decide to test out moving funds from my offline wallet to my Mycelium mobile wallet. Swipe phone, open Mycelium click QR code to make it big. Open my Electrum watch-only wallet and click "send" tab. Click "Scan QR code", and hold phone up to webcam, snap. Verify address start/end chars match up. Enter amount. Click "Show Unsigned TxQR", so QR shows on screen.
10:31 am - Do the XBMC poweroff, net disconnect, insert Raspian and boot sequence, but with a webcam attached. Open Electrum wallet and click "send" tab. Click "Scan TxQR", and drag webcam over to point at notebook screen. Snap QR. Confirm details and enter password to sign the trx. 
10:32 am - On notebook click "Scan TxQR", and point notebook webcam over at HD screen. Snap signed QR code. Send. Power off Raspian system and swap SD card back to XBMC. Tuck away SD card again. 
10:33 am - watch Mycelium confirm money arrived on phone.
10:42 am - kind of bored now, so spend the rest of the day reading reddit and posting witty replies, while getting progressively more zinged up on caffeine. 
8:43 pm - Check my wallet balance. Still there. Nice. Gotta go eat something.
I case you can't tell, I like Electrum for my secure offline wallet and there are several variations on using it.

I think so. It's easier to remember than a long password. Well, to me at least. Anything like this you have to periodically refresh it, at first every day and then weekly or longer. If it has great value then I think you would refresh it in your memory often. I'd worry perhaps the GPS co-ords of the city may change. I mean not really change but maybe some day they change the location of city hall or whatever they use to decide the official location. But it could be anything special to you, like a tree nearby home or whatever. Maybe something other than a city location would be better, but I think the idea of some memory item that maps onto a numeric index into the blockchain is feasible. 
For me, I still have seed words written down for now, but I'm thinking about this, maybe.

Maybe you can make friends with a local merchant who accepts btc and doesn't mind selling a bit on the side. As a minor, or even as an adult, I'd be careful of any back alley type dealings.

As requested here is the steps I used to create this (for Ubuntu, you can likely do this on Windows too but I couldn't say what changes are needed).
You need to git clone the repo. So that means you need git installed if not already.
    sudo apt-get install git
    git clone 
    cd electrum
You'll need a package called gource to do the visuals
    sudo apt-get install gource
Do a test render first with no options. It will pop up in a window. Press Esc when you've seen enough. Use a different render size if you like.
    gource -1280x720
To render the gravatar icons so programmers look nice you need a script that is on the gource wiki. The perl one did not work for me but further down the page there is a python one which worked fine but needed pip3 installed first. 
So copy-paste the python script on this page into a file named git-gravatar (somewhere in your path so it can be run easily):
    
To make it easy I stuck it in a pastebin:
    
So once you have that file 
    chmod +x git-gravatar
    sudo pip3 install --upgrade requests
Or if you get pip related errors then you may need something like
    sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
    sudo easy_install3 pip
Run the git-gravatar script and it will build a collection of icons. You'll see it access the gravatar files and lots of urls and crap spew out.
    git-gravatar
Run gource again, piping to ffmpeg, to render into a file. If you don't have ffmpeg then you will also need to get that package, and it needs to be a good new one with h264 enabled. On Ubuntu that may mean using a PPA instead of the normal package.
Here's the final command I used with my desired bitrates etc. You would want to change the title and filename probably.
    gource -1280x720 --auto-skip-seconds 1 --seconds-per-day 0.1 --hide filenames,dirnames,progress --user-image-dir .git/avatar/ --date-format "%B %e, %Y" --title "Electrum - Easy To Use Bitcoin Wallet" -o - | ffmpeg -y -r 30 -f image2pipe -vcodec ppm -i - -vcodec libx264 -profile:v high -preset ultrafast -b:v 2000k -maxrate 3000k -bufsize 4000k -pix_fmt yuv420p -crf 1 -threads 0 -bf 0 electrum.mp4
Last thing I did was choose an audio file and trim it to correct length. And then I used mkvmerge to combine the mp4 and audio into a final mp4. There's probably lots of ways to do that including ffmpeg again, but I had this handy and it worked.

What process would he suggest for developing the technology to a point where it's suddenly universally usable and released upon the world? The whole 5 year history of bitcoin is an experimental process of starting from nothing and incrementally approaching a stable state. Many bitcoiners have been very clear from the beginning about how this is an experimental and developing creative process. Anyone who is jumping in now and risking money should be very aware that volatility is a given, that failure is a possibility but that the underlying technology and direction has great merit. 
He could do a small thought experiment about how one might create a new money from nothing without a central authority enforcing usage; how it can come to have value organically, globally, and reach a mature level of usage such that the price is stable. You don't just announce one day that this new thing is IT and everyone is going to use it without question.
He may have issues with the underlying algorithms. But he is always welcome to create a coin that has his mechanisms and present that to the world to gain support for his ideas. God knows hundreds of others have already taken their stab at a new currency. 
If people like Paul Krugman had any creativity left in them they would already be designing their own "proper" currency, but he and people like him, are quite content with the status quo. You cannot re-invent finance by spending twenty years at the drawing board and then forcing it upon the world. Bitcoin succeeds by succeeding.

No. I think the idea is that the "bitcointip" site (to paraphrase "oniontip") would scan the network getting btc address info from every node it can detect and creating a database of addresses to distribute the total tips out to. It doesn't seem like there would be a way to determine nodes that are more worthy and so I guess each one would get an equal portion. 
Kind of makes me wonder how oniontip detects the worthiness of a particular Tor node. If it depends on the Tor node to not lie about it's bandwidth then I could imagine people hacking and rebuilding Tor to earn a larger portion by misreporting.

Govt and businesses are particularly at risk for this type of event because it's entirely plausible that an employee can infect their systems and never be detected. They already have access, they know what data is critical, and whether backups aren't in place, and the can arrange it so other employees can be blamed. Seems like a perfect storm waiting to happen.

I thought your explanation was fine for average people. It gives a rough idea of how it works without complex functions. I only wanted to answer the question cypherdoc2 asked but then found myself filling in more detail. Adding the number 1 or some very large number still creates a repeatable sequence.
When I first read BIP32 I thought it was brilliant how the sequence step was also derived from the seed such that an attacker doesn't know either that or the first key.  There are some radically smart cookies doing the background math work in Bitcoin.

Yes. I'm not up to date now, as I quit last fall after 2.5 years, but I can say that miners bought last summer were obsolete by November. The other issue is that ASIC miners have no use beyond mining. You can't turn around and use them for rendering graphics, or serving or cracking passwords even. Whether any miner will ever pay back it's purchase cost entirely depends on how quickly the difficulty rises and bitcoin market price (and electricity cost but you have an edge there). So you have to make an accurate projection of future difficulty, and future price, or you will lose. Even in the case of solar electrics you have a cost for wear on batteries. I haven't done any recent calc but you'll want to do that. And check in on where they discuss this a lot more than here. Better yet - read the [bitcointalk.org]( mining section.

That should be covered by the exchange. If the exchange is doing what they should then he is not able to "not pay you back". ie. you trust the exchange to make sure they can't run with the cash before buying back the btc, either at a profit or loss to them. 
If the btc price rises then at some point their loss exceeds their funds available and the exchange issues a margin call and forces buying back the btc (the infamous short squeeze, wiping out their account).

There are different kinds of cars. Cheap cars would be like gold trading for it's intrinsic value at roughly 5% it's price. An expensive Porsche is an example of a car which has most of it's value in status, and is like Gold actually trading for massively above it's intrinsic value. Porsche ~ 95% status, Gold ~ 95% fear/safety myth. 
You can only accept Gold having intrinsic value if you also accept that it trades well above it's intrinsic value; so far above that it is truly 95% speculative value. 
Peter Schiff's whole (unspoken) argument rests entirely on his belief that Bitcoin holders are more likely to dump their coins than Gold holders are to dump their Gold. That's really what matters in speculative markets. They're both quite similar except whereas Gold looks back at tradition, Bitcoin looks forward at innovation. I know which one I prefer but it's not that surprising that a lot of people feel comfy sticking with tradition.

This is how I made my Electrum seed, which in turns gives me any number of keys.
Anyone doing this should be aware that not all dice are created equal. Most low cost dice (toy game) dice have rounded corners and tend to favour "1"; they have bias. But high quality casino dice having sharp edges roll very close to unbiased. We discussed this some months back in the crypto reddit.
Also, d16 (16 sided) dice are quite useful for keys/seeds as it's easy to hex digits directly. Treat 10 as being 0, and 11-16 as A-F. Then theirs the Hexadice but I haven't been able to buy one and check it's edges and bias.

People have asked about this before and reported that the raspPI can't handle a full node. But I wonder if anyone has looked at writing the hash/crypto routines to use the GPU. While not fast enough to be useful for mining it may enhance the verification steps enough to be be workable. 
As mentioned by someone above it's also worth starting with the last torrent checkpoint on a fast machine for initial syncing and then moving the drive to the raspPI for ongoing blocks, because otherwise the raspPI is so slow that you basically never get caught up.
Another thing to explore. I wonder if enhancing the crypto functions would leave the disk as bottleneck, and then using a large RAM cache / swap space for that would get to a workable solution. Or a RAM disk "overlay fs" on top of a slow (usb) drive for the read-only data underneath, with periodic write-thru, after some blocks.

Look into using Electrum in offline/online mode. Online wallet for small amounts and a watch-only wallet associated with your offline wallet. Electrum allows having multiple wallet files you can select.
I used Electrum on a RaspPi connected to my TV to create the offline wallet and then transfer only the MPK (master public key) back to the online watch-only wallet. The offline wallet resides on the SD card, stored securely, for convenient access but also write down the 12 word seed as backup. It allows recreating the wallet in case the SD card is lost/damaged/stolen.
There's several variations on this but Electrum makes it easy to create a trx with the online wallet and copy it to the offline wallet (via USB stick) to be signed and returned to broadcast via the online wallet, without exposure to a keylogger or virus.
Part of the beauty of this is that you can generate new addresses for your offline wallet while online, and send funds there, without exposing the key or pwd.

There is several ways to associate an address with an identity even beyond what is obvious by disclosing directly. 
With current wallets all inputs to a transaction are associated. Say an address is used to pay someone known (eg. a business with your info) and then at another time is combined into a transaction with the address you desire to be secret - that associates them. A common way this happens is with "change" outputs, which feed btc back to your wallet and often get pulled into a new transaction. "Change" is easy to re-associate between trxs.
You need for every input to the trx to be "clean", only used once and from an unknown origin, and to make sure any change is not reused in an unrelated trx. Managing this requires careful attention. Some wallets offer "coin control" for this purpose but many  hide this mechanism for convenience.
Web wallets (like Coinbase) use common pooled addresses and so may or may not mix inputs in random ways. But this isn't useful anyway since they very obviously know who you are. 
It is possible to make a wallet which combines inputs from unrelated owners. I think Dark Wallet may have some functionality like that but I haven't really researched what they're doing beyond obviously some mix capability.
@_date: 2014-01-06 05:21:32
This is not true. You do need to know that change may be sent to a third address depending on what client you use and how the transaction is formed. Unless you are hand building a transaction they typically do not send the change as fees. Some users have done that by mistake when hand building a transaction, eg. by using an unsafe tool like brainwallet.org (that does not safety check for user errors).

If you mean in a fantasy where everyone suddenly stops at once, then no, transactions would stop too. But if you mean in any real world scenario where miners turn off over time due to non-profitability, then yes, the difficulty adjusts and mining becomes more profitable again.

You should have a separate unrelated system which takes care of signing transactions. So the keys are never on the publicly visible one. The signing system should have a set of checks for detecting abuse and only deal with a very simple protocol of receiving an unsigned trx and replying with a signed trx, or broadcasting without reply. There should be no other functions, or ways to use the system, for other reasons. Keep it as simple as possible and fully sanitize the receipt of unsigned trxs. Probably pass them through a secure tunnel as well, using ssh. That's very easy to setup and limit in function with a special shell.

I've only just started thinking about it and it would take some very careful figuring to reward those providing a useful function. So far I've been thinking of nodes that crawl and index independently and build their own index. Then users submissions are via portal nodes (which may be themselves) that encode terms and distribute them to the network. The indexing nodes return results which are consolidated by a portal node and ranked. Portal nodes might then be able to judge utility and downgrade index nodes that provide poor results, reward those that provide useful ones. How that works and what algorithms a portal uses may determine the utility of that portal as well. Anyway, it's just a stab in the dark so far and maybe after thinking it through more it will prove too unwieldy, or not. IDK.

I agree with your intent here except that owning BTC doesn't reduce fiat in the system.

Contracts like futures and options always include some part of the price as risk for volatility. It doesn't come for free as no one will risk having the price move against them without some chance of gain. With bitcoin being so volatile the risk factor is high so the cost of an option or future should also be high, relative to an underlying asset that is stable. 
Typically options are priced using  something like the [Black-Scholes equation]( (there are others), which relate a cost for risk given volatility or vice versa. There are online calculators but also this model only fits certain circumstances. I doubt it would work out well for bitcoin.
Enforcement of contracts like this is part of what an exchange provides - ensuring funds, or underlying asset, are on hand to cover the contracts. Doing this between friends with no collateral is not a good idea unless you want to stress the relationship and end up sore enemies. 
In your example, your friend is offering you a call option (saying he will sell you btc at X price) but it has to have a date range where it's valid, otherwise he is taking on unlimited risk. He needs to price that option according to his risk over the given time period. Given btc volatility that price should be high, not free as in your example. 
So bottom line, convincing your friend to buy/sell btc to hedge your risk is not a good strategy.

Just had a look, after at least several months away, and see they have made changes. The old wordlist is no longer in the mnemonic.py file and they now use a language selectable wordlist that appears to be 2048 words, starting with "abandon ability able".
The older legacy word list was within mnemonic.py and started with "like just love... unseen weapon weary" and is 1626 long. I still have it on my system.
However, a comment in the current version says seed derivation does not follow BIP39. I believe this is 2.0 (future) code as release notes indicate it supports BIP39+32+44. I don't believe 1.9.8 does but could be wrong.

The nodes with those ledgers would show the "bad info", but the remaining nodes would not accept their transactions and still use their "good" chain. 
Which means the "someone" running those bad nodes would only affect themselves or users they could force to use their ledger, eg. an online wallet also run by that "someone". The rest of the network would not accept transactions that were based on blocks in the bad ledger. Essentially the network would split in two.

Two factors play together with use/demand. Velocity and adoption interact. If more people adopt and use BTC then they need to buy/accept it first. How long they hold onto it relates to velocity. More people buying and holding must push the price up. More people buying and using, but it being sold by the receiver doesn't have the same push on price unless the volume increases enough to make the short hold period significant. So the interaction is complex. However, there is a slowly increasing supply of BTC, so adoption/holding that increases at a quicker rate than that supply will on average push the price up. I say on average because the daily news here still causes radical swings in price as people try to play the market.

With Electrum the cold storage is deterministic (w/seed). So change gets sent back to an address generated in the same wallet.
You generate the wallet offline (eg. I use a Raspberry Pi that doubles as my xbmc TV by swapping SD card), and copy the MPK to the desktop (online) to create a watch-only wallet. This wallet monitors the addresses as deposits occur. It can create an unsigned trx which is copied (usb or QR code snapshot) to the offline wallet for signing. Once signed it is returned same way to be sent on the network. The steps are simple and integrated into the gui/menu now (are shown in watch-only wallet).
Since the whole wallet is offline you don't worry about individual keys and change being lost. You can write down a paper copy of the seed words for backup. Or an encrypted backup if preferred.
It is possible to make a BIP38 encrypted seed by using only part of the key as the seed value when creating the wallet. This can also act as a plausibly deniable (hidden)  cold storage by placing a small amount on the key.

They don't need anything like that. 
All they do is watch transactions as they are sent on the network with a simple bitcoind node. When they see a transaction that matches a list of known addresses (that they have keys to) they submit a transaction that spends from the address. It will most likely be included by the miners AFTER the one just seen and therefore be later in the same block. That is why it happened in the same second - it was mined in the same block. Anyone else getting there later will be treated as a double spend because this one was logged first.

I'm with you. I don't like "bits" at all and I feel a unit around the mBTC size would be better, at least until the price reaches over $10k each.
I've been avoiding the whole thing because there seems to be a group of people who constantly want to force this idea and I don't want to fight about it. I'd rather see a new unit for a larger count of satoshis.

Just "Gigabyte" - as in a fixed amount of data of some large size - large enough to look random but small enough to be much easier than a full brute force attack. I'm just taking a naive approach as I'm sure there are methods requiring less data and more math.
It may not even need to be that large. Let's say you take a fixed set of known binaries that ship in linux. These are always present on the system. My naive broken RNG generates a random number from /dev/urandom as usual but then indexes that number of bytes into this set of binaries and extracts a sequence of 256 bytes. It runs that through SHA256 to generate a very plausible random byte sequence to give the user.
Problem is, anyone knowing the list of binaries has only to search the space of SHA outputs of that fixed data set. Plus, they can apply updates as they come out to stay in sync. Using that input to seeds/keys would give you a very small search space.

Your passphrase/password is hashed to create your private key, which is what secures your bitcoins. A brain wallet is only safe if the phrase used to generate the key is sufficiently random and a major problem with this site is the randomness is highly suspect. 
Anyone, anywhere in the world who is hashing phrases like this could find your key. Given that the phrase isn't truly random and that people are attacking hashed phrases at such high speeds now, it's quite probable bitcoins on such an address will be swiped.

Isn't there supposed to be a way to drop all spent outputs. I haven't run a  node in a long time but that was much discussed even 2 years ago so why hasn't this become the norm yet? Also, I thought there was some talk of this again for the next version.

I wrote some python code that I think is probably the most efficient monitoring method. New addresses are added to a db table on demand. It then checks each new block (with a lag for confirmation count) and looks up each block unspent output in the db, which should be very fast if indexed correctly, and only done once every 10 minutes (on average). From that it can trigger a pmt db update. So it bypasses the normal wallet altogether. When you need to consolidate for an spend, it uses paid address indices to generate keys to build that trx. However, so far I have not tested it for real world use. It is fairly simple code.
@_date: 2014-11-23 05:02:33
Well, sort of. The actual blockchain has the second one and the first one never gets confirmed but blockchain.info will drop it and your account will show your balance correctly since only the second one actually occurred. 
But to make it more complex I see that your second transaction actually used a different output than the first one. So likely even if the second one confirms then the first will remain pending and you would need to send again to use that original output. If you hover over the "output" link on each transaction input you'll see it refers to a different trx output in each of the first two attempts. It gets more complicated when you spend from change returned to the same address.
My guess right now is that if the second one confirms, the first will remain pending since it uses output /0 not output /1 used by the second one. A bit of a rats nest you've got there now.

A private key is 256 bits (and the address is generated from the key). An Electrum seed is 128 bits and is used as a generator for any number of keys/addresses.
There are several ways to use various types of dice. One simple way with normal 6 sided casino dice is to roll 2 dice and only use 1-4, discarding any 5,6 rolls. You need a zero value for converting to bits so the easiest way is treating A 4 as a zero. ie. 1,2,3,0 are represented in bits as 01,10,11,00. If you roll 2 dice then you get 2 x 2bits per roll, which conveniently is a "hex" digit that you can enter in Electrum (or bitaddress.org for keys). Hex digits are easier to work with and using the small table above you can convert 2 x 2 bits into a hex digit as you roll them and write down hex digits.
256 bits is the same as 64 hex digits, and 128 bits is the same as 32 hex digits. 
Example using Electrum.
So let's say you roll 2 dice and get 3 and 5. You would roll the 5 again and maybe get 4 (treating as zero). 3 is "10" and 4 is "00", so you could write down "1000" or use the table and write down 8 (hex). Repeat 32 times and you have a 32 digit hex value to enter into Electrum. Open Electrum and choose "File, Restore". Choose "from seed" and type in the rolled 32 hex digits. It will create the wallet and you should write down the 12 word seed as backup because knowing those 12 words will allow restoring the wallet any time in future if your wallet is lost or corrupted. Keep them safe and secret, of course.

Holy smokes. I see you've got 5 transactions dependent on unconfirmed outputs nested back to your first attempt. I really don't know if you'll be able to skip over those but to do it you would need specific control over selecting the original outputs you used back in the first one. I'm not aware of a wallet that offers that ability but I believe it may be possible by manually assembling a trx and pushing it via a "pushtx" service. That's not easy and very prone to mistakes. 
Your trxs after the first indicate high priority so your best bet is to wait for one of them to confirm and see where the dust settles.

ChangeTip only needs an account for posting confirmations. To be quiet they could agree not to do that and leave it to the users tip page, or perhaps only do it the first time to request sign up and then be quiet. 
It's the confirmations that add a lot of bloat and can be annoying. Does stackoverflow have private messaging? It could use that.
They would be dicks if they just started banning users who simply use the word in their posts but even that could be worked around by using intent monikers without the changetip word, eg. "have a coffee on me.", where "on me" found by a registered tipper triggers the tip. It would be very hard to ban a read-only non-polluting service.

Bitcoins are recorded as transactions in the blockchain data held by every node around the world. So the value doesn't depend on any one entity. Having the right private key is enough to access and "spend" that value later.
So your task is finding a good way to keep the private key safe for 20 years even from yourself. There are many ways you could figure to do this but you'll really need to think it through as anything or everything could change by then including whether Bitcoin still exists and what value it has. 
A private key is essentially just a very large random number. It's security relies on the inability for someone else to guess a very long random number easily (and by not easily I mean all the computers in existance for much, much longer than your lifetime).
You could simply use a BIP38 key with password. Then you are caught with having to save the key somehow, tattoo it or whatever. Assuming you don't want a point of failure or trust then it has to be **not** on yourself but somewhere you can access someday. And the password you just memorize - it prevents another person from using it. 
The key need not be written as numbers. It could be a pattern of dots (dice faces, bars, binary, whatever) notched into a bridge girder or multiple places. What matters is you can re-create the number again and that it will still be there in 20 years. Same idea goes for an Electrum seed, which is good as well. Try not to get too complicated as this can easily go awry over time.

If there is a lot of new short selling then they'd better be very careful because when it comes time to cover they are going to be trying to do that in a market of strong holders - all those true believers holding and doubling down won't be flipping on the way up. When it comes time to cover the price will explode and some may find themselves being forced to cover (squeeze).
The nightmare for short sellers is true believers - something you don't find so much in other markets. The best outcome for price is if the OTC buyers-right-now eventually tighten up and force all short sellers to buy back on the exchanges.

You can use a single miner. But honestly it doesn't make any sense. The whole purpose of mining the blockchain is to secure the transactions in a decentralized manner where no one has privileged control. If you are centralized then it's much easier to use a sql database to store the same info - and give people tokens called coins. As a black box, from outside viewers, it make no difference.
And to clarify in your question - Bitcoin mining does not ever stop. The block reward simply halves each four years until it becomes zero. Miners receive two forms of payment - the block reward and the transaction fees. The expectation is that as the block reward diminishes the transaction volume will increase and fees take over the role of compensation. The mechanism is always a balance between reward and mining difficulty. When difficulty is too high for the reward miners drop out, which causes a drop in difficulty. So this feedback means that over time the mining profit always approaches the minimum acceptable to miners.
@_date: 2014-10-08 10:50:32
Who's going to pay the miner reward? It can't just be created out of thin air like Bitcoin. As soon as you have an exchange the USDCoin price will diverge from the real USD price, ie not 1:1 any more, to account for the risk that you later cannot change back. As soon as the value diverges you are back to a floating currency that may as well be called ShitCoin - because without miners being rewarded it won't be secure and very easy to double spend.

I think using Electrum is one of the easier, more felxible, wallets. It allows easily maintaining several separate wallets and switching between them. Since it uses a "seed" to generate a sequence of addresses it's also easy to extend (for a programmer) into automated address generation. Using an MPK, addresses can be auto-handed out to any number of people that will all belong (mathematically) to the same wallet. Keeping backups is also easier with a seed. I won't explain it all here but it is worth looking into in more detail.

@_date: 2014-11-25 02:01:51
If you stored the MPK in the tag and the reader used the current timestamp as it's index on that then it could create a unique address at any time. However, to find the address and transaction again the "owning wallet" would need to track timestamps, or scan all of them in sequence. 
It's not too hard to scan them all if it is online and monitoring blocks as they occur because it only need generate addresses since the last block, for each new block. But if it's offline normally and only connects when viewed by the user it has a lot of checking to make sure it finds all possible new trxs. It's much simpler if the knows expected trx and times, which may be feasible depending on how this may be used.

Check here, for BIP32 specification.
There is a list of implementations at the bottom which may help locate independent code. eg.
Also, note that Mycelium is open source. That means the code can be cloned from [github]( and saved for future use, or for modification. I don't know of anyone extracting the core code and making a simple cmd line recovery tool but it is feasible. Has been done for Electrum (legacy seeds) - a totally independent key gen tool requiring only core python. 
I do believe the word list is not standardized and varies by language. So it's not a bad idea to tuck away a copy of the codebase for future use. I'd like to see a BIP38-like encrypted seed format that is independent of word list. Maybe someone is working on that?

I had a quick look at the source and see that BIP14 is coded in but the comment string is blank (at least on my outdated local code). It looks like a simple change but it would require building bitcoin from source. It's not so hard but not something your average user is familiar with.
Another approach that is easier is to run a proxy that can filter and substitute the address into the comment's place. Then configure bitcoind to communicate via the proxy. That requires no re-building and runs with any current install. I haven't explored it but there are some simple proxies pkgs around and perhaps even a fairly simple python script would work well enough.

"The URL on each address"? What does that even mean. The bitcoin addresses and transactions don't have an URL or a message. You're talking about messages stuck into a database at blockchain.info which has no connection to any user unless blockchain.info was to log IPs for people who come to look at the message on their site. 
Lets say some 3-letter agency served a warrant on blockchain.info requiring them to log visitors and then the agency spammed the network to try and locate people with interest in particular transactions.

The old modem type sounds are nasty but for something as small as an address it would only last less than 1 second (even at 300 baud). Alternately musical tones could be decoded fairly easily by an app but would take a bit longer depending on the minimum duration that an app can detect for each character. There is 58 chars, so mapping each to a note across 5 octaves is feasible, though a naive approach.
Another issue is that you would need to have it listening at the right moment or it's missed. I suppose the app could be started early in the programme and just sit in listen mode, or even be always listening.

But it doesn't have to store the whole chain at any point, right? I mean, is the chosen GB size a sliding window of the last blocks, and as you move up the chain, even from zero, the older ones are discarded?
I ask because in situations where you have to pay for storage, like a VPS server, you don't want to have to start with 30GB even though later you'll discard 25GB and run with 5GB. You'd want to use 5GB from the VPS provisioning right until you're caught up and functional.

For starters, your answering that question of coercion would probably put you in contempt. You would need to have that aspect also unprovable. So a good example would be two passwords, one which releases funds and a duress one which locks funds, or releases different lesser funds.
But you can do the same with Electrum or any deterministic wallet and be just as unprovable. Keep your seed words safely written down but change one word. The court demands your seed and you provide it, and it discloses a wallet with a small and innocent balance. That is your duress wallet. But change one word (or some better variation, reverse several) and you have access to the hidden key balance. 
Your defence is that the address they think you control, you do not control.

Unclear what you need here. You want something that takes a USD price and converts it to BTC at current price and then prints a paper QR code for use as a tag? Or something else?
The QR code is easy to create as it simply contains a text string in a standard (BIP21) format like "bitcoin:1xxx...xxx?amount=1.234". So all you need is a very simple script to grab a quote and output a string to a QR encoder/printer. What is your input data? 
But if this is your intent then do you plan to reprint them often as the price varies? Or maybe you want something completely different.

I think the reason there was always a premium price at MtGox is that they were adding demand buying BTC to cover BTC withdrawls to delay the failure. After all, it was customer funds that would eventually be depleted and price was less important than delaying failure. This notion puts the cover up starting when the price ran up from $100 to peak at $1254. During this time until BTC withdrawls stopped the price was usually significantly higher on MtGox than other exchanges.
Anyway, we'll never really know aything much until independent investigations happen and I expect the entire purpose of filing for bankruptcy re-org is to delay/avoid outside exposition.

There is no "site". You use an app to tap into a network. How it looks to users is going to depend mostly on the app and how the user "filters" the available buying choices.

Usually the password encrypts the private keys. If they manage to get a plain text version of the key then they can spend the funds controlled by it. There is no password control on Bitcoin or the block chain itself - the key acts as this.

The BR would only sell all it's coins if the price were too high. Which isn't a problem, it buys them back as the price falls. It only ever needs to buy enough to keep the price up, not worry about selling too many.
Next, the market already is a natural crowd-sourced BR because of all the people who hold btc. At any moment only a tiny fraction are available on the market, when the price falls the BR aka "TrueBelievers" step in and buy. 
But I do think selling junk for bitcoins is a great way to shore up reserves that would otherwise be sitting idle. Maybe Bitcoin User groups should organize **Bitcoin Swap Meets** where once a week people meet up and sell stuff for bitcoins. Bring a few ATMs along and the general public can buy idle junk, while the TrueBeliever sellers can shore up the de-centralized BR.

Not entirely relevant. 
The IP address is not recorded in the trx. When you send a trx it is relayed thru nodes. If the first node it's sent to is recording IPs for an authority then it could get captured. But if it gets relayed before it hits a recording node then it's the last relay IP which is tracked. 
If you send thru an Electrum server, which normally doesn't log this data, then the best IP that can be tracked is that of the server. If you run your own server then you can control that. Some Electrum servers and regular nodes offer Tor access. If you send through a web wallet then most likely your IP is logged. If you use a VPN or SOCKS proxy then it's less likely to be logged. 
There's numerous ways to make sure your real IP is not associated with a trx but the most naive approach has some probability of being tracked.

I have a couple suggestions to try if it's worth the time for you.
First, the word list for electrum is,
I have previously extracted and sorted this to get some idea how many words are similar. It doesn't account for different first letters but otherwise you can quickly see words spelled almost the same. Copy and paste the word list including quotes/commas into a text file (eg. elecwords.txt), then run it through sort command (linux) as follows,
sort -i elecwords.txt &gt;elecsorted.txt
Now view that sorted list for closely spelled words. eg. deep and deeply
( edit: notably: begin, began, begun )
Second, consider that you got distracted part way through entering words and may have typed one twice without noticing. So if you're trying variations try some with sequentially one word doubled.

There is some sample MPK code for server use in the [Electrum github] Electrum is made up of modules which you can easily import into any scripts you write. It makes it moderately easy to build custom systems based around a deterministic seed / wallet.
You can generate new addresses on the web front end using an MPK. And then on some totally unrelated server you can monitor the wallet (with that same MPK) for decision making or reporting. That server could generate transactions for winners and send them (still a net connected wallet). 
There are many ways to approach this depending on what you actually need to do and how complicated you can get. Even the front end could make decisions about winners but instead of signing/sending payments it could generate unsigned transactions which are queued for offline signing (email can be used a queue but using gpg to encrypt may make sense, or a proper message queuing system). 
An admin user on a distinct computer could be monitoring this queue and checking validity before signing and sending. The signing step is possible offline using a usb stick if necessary. You would want to figure out what type of validating to do - maybe ensuring payments are below some percent of receipts, or match up with existing received funds, and of certain amounts only. You want to ensure if the front end is compromised someone cannot issue fake payments that you blindly sign.
Electrum is written in python but it wouldn't be hard to translate the address gen code into PHP for a front end server if that is needed. The actual address code is quite small. See [this github]( for examples of simplified address gen code - small enough to convert to PHP. I'm sure there's many other git repos with code for deterministic wallets as well.

Ya, it wouldn't be a useful attack if only one Tx was included in a block. To lose funds there has to be more than one with same output amount to same address within a time period allowed by the automated resend. 
It wouldn't be hard to make a script that scanned the blockchain for Tx that matchthis criteria for any given time period N hours.

Here's a simple idea. 
All you need is a tiny microcontroller embedded in the object. Most micro-controllers have some SRAM which initializes in a random state. The startup bit pattern is fed thru N rounds of sha256 (simple enough code) to produce the random key. First power up it generates a key and stores the key in flash memory. It needs to generate the address as well, which may be slowish but not too hard.
Next, you need a way to query the address to verify the balance. Simplest I can think of is a single LED on the object. You show that to a webcam and an app can read a high frequency pattern of flashes and decode the address.
To extract the key you need to trigger some special state like a pin inserted and held to trigger spend mode. It can flash the LED to send the key in the same way - but of course, once done must reset to a new random key since the device has been swept. 
Or it could be designed to go dead - the LED no longer flashes, meaning it has been swept. Or it could be a dual colour LED which flashes RED when dead and GREEN when containing the correct balance. That way you can tell by looking that it has correct value. But you still need to prevent fakes from being made that always flash GREEN.  ha ha.
Another approach could be to make it usb shaped so that it can be plugged into a usb port, which can read the address or key (but again the key must always reset once read).
The cost to make one of these would be about $1.20 even at low volume. This is easily doable now.

I think the typically 4% currency conversion might make that really hard.
@_date: 2014-10-20 17:31:44
I think I'd make sure any relevant blocks wouldn't be in the last 1000 or so. That's roughly 325,000 to choose from that won't ever re-org, and then there's typically 100-1000 trx in each block. So it's a really big space to choose a few hashes out of. And then you can salt into the hashes too - concat your birthday or a password. Whatever methodology, I don't see at all why you would need to specify it publicly.

I also thought entropy was a pretty specific measure. At least it doesn't seem very difficult to me.
Another thing. She mentions that a pronounceable generated word is better than a random word phrase but I would argue that if a program can generate pronounceable words then it can just as easily guess them and such words, while easier to remember, would be much easier to brute force. Their search space would be much smaller than same length random chars.

Exactly. People don't realize that the RNG on any system could be feeding them from a GB pool of random looking data.

The U2F dongles now coming out should help a lot with this. It has a secure key store in the dongle and registers your site specific public key at the site, and then verifies using a challenge-response on subsequent visits. Each key is derived from site url and certificate data and your own random value. You still need to ensure you register with the correct site initially. They are available on Amazon for $5.99 and already supported by Google for 2FA. Hopefully we'll see major take up of this by sites.

Yes. It will restore a wallet from either. 
You can also give it the 64 hex digit MPK (master public key) and it will restore as watch-only (cannot spend). This is great for offline secure wallets. Create the wallet offline with dice, save the seed "on paper", and copy the MPK to your online system via usb stick to allow keeping an eye on it. You can generate new addresses online and send funds to them - and only spend if you have the seed. 
This is how I use Electrum with my Raspberry Pi connected to my TV.
BTW using the hex key is good if you want to use "Shamir Secret Sharing" to split it into many parts as the parts are much smaller than using the words.
@_date: 2014-03-13 09:21:09

If I recall, as it's been a while, on blockchain.info there is an "advanced" tab which enables the export function. You would look at the addresses used as inputs to your trx, hopefully only one or two, and then export the private keys for those. These are long number strings starting with 5... You don't exactly need to export if you can copy/paste the values over to the "import private key" entry on Electrum.
If we are talking about more than small amounts then you should be aware that viewing/exporting or copy/paste does expose the keys and is vulnerable to any attacker who could have access to your system. So there is some risk dependent on how secure your system is. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 14:09:29
It sounds like this allows people to fund their investment with BTC, which means it's a way to sell BTC. So unless they just bought them for this purpose, which would be neutral, it offers BTC holders another avenue for divesting.

The 2.0 version in the repo now has some support for Trezor. I don't how well it works with other wallets. I also believe it's still pre-release, though the code is there for testing. I tried it today a bit but still mainly use 1.9.8. I did notice that opening an old wallet in 2.0 upgrades the format and so it's good to make a backup first to allow rolling back. 2.0 adds a number of new features including multi-sig and payment requests.

@_date: 2014-10-10 09:03:07
If you buy in bulk then you need to adjust for the risk of the price moving against you. Given how volatile BTC is that would mean a hefty percent you would need to charge just to hedge the risk. This is one reason why private trades are often so far off market rate - even executing offset trades every few hours means hefty fees when the price can move 10-20% in a day. It's easy to think you will be on the winning side of any hedge but if you believe that then you soon find out that you are just inexperienced.

I found the movie entertaining but I've lived through much of this and so it's cool to see a summary. I don't think it is the right approach for a more general audience. It focuses too much on mining and is too hit and miss in scope. I've never been a fan of personal stories and there's no personal climax. It just kind of ends with $1000 price and fades out. A lot of people are immediately going to react by thinking "ya but didn't I hear about it crashing after that". 
IMO It's better to focus away from price and towards what it can enable for global commerce. But obviously that is a different movie hopefully we'll see someday. Hey, are you listening BBC - how could Bitcoin impact Africa/Asia and it's relation with the world thru grass roots direct commerce?

I'm going to say it in case you don't know and since no one else has: **Electrum** for both offline and desktop wallets. Offline - generate seed on a clean booted system (or with dice) w/o net connection and write down seed words (redundantly). Desktop for watch-only using MPK and also another for daily working wallet. 
Not trying to be a dick, but having the **seeds** for a deterministic wallet is great comfort when dealing with keys, passwords, wallet files etc. It means you always know you can go back to basics and regenerate the wallet. It means your wallet depends on math rather than a thousand intricate gears and cogs hidden in software and user behaviour.

The ability to delegate and revoke is equivalent to the ability to spend. Whatever process is put in place to validate this delegation/revocation must be just as protected as the ability to spend. If you don't want to break the decentralization then this reduces to something which is equivalent to multi-sig addresses, which spread the spend privilege over several valid keys. One key can be held by a revocation agent preventing use of the other key, or requiring another third party to consent (depending on the M/N setup).

You might look at serving a Bitcoin option geographically where you get very poor conversions via PP/CC.

@_date: 2014-12-15 07:53:08
Example of "just don't do it": selling via Paypal, ebay or any reversible method. You receive payment, send bitcoins, but then they file a claim to reverse payment. But you have no way to reverse bitcoins once sent. Anything with a bank in the middle is probably also reversible so beware unless you actually fully trust the buyer. Using an escrow (third party) can mitigate some issues, eg. when using localbitcoins.com
btw, regarding a response you posted above. You don't actually "buy" a key or address. These are things you can create yourself as needed, but once you create them (usually in a wallet) you fund the address via a transaction. So when you pay someone $$$ for btc they will "sign" the bought btc into your address using their private key. That transaction is verified and logged into the blockchain as definitive record. 
The blockchain is completely public and maintained by thousands of bitcoin clients worldwide. You can look at transactions (in human readable form) via a viewer site like blockchain.info or blockr.io but the actual blockchain data itself is only updated by miners using the bitcoin protocol.

If you have your backup seed you should immediately create a new wallet and send the btc to that wallet. The laptop robber, assuming they have any clue, can brute force your wallet. It's security depends on the strength of your password used to encrypt the file. If you used a long (20-24 char) random password you may be safe, but if you used a more typical 7-10 char password non-random chars, then it will be short work for any capable brute force attack. The thief may not bother for just 0.25 btc but wouldn't you rather be safe against any future compromise of the stolen wallet? He could just sell it on to some hackers.

Electrum servers can log address lookups. Mostly the operators say they delete logs but anytime you deal with a server it is possible for logs to be kept that would associate IP with addresses. Those logs are only available to whoever runs the server unless for some reason they shared them with others. Electrum can support Tor so if you are worried about that you should use Tor to connect to the server. I don't have an updated list of Tor Electrum server nodes but probably you can find one by checking on bitcointalk forums.

I actually saw that. A couple days ago I went looking for an alternative to Yubikeys and came across this on the way to finding the FIDO U2F and HW-1 as well. I didn't read about this one beyond using as an auth device. I'm now thinking more about sidestepping auth-only devices for something which can sign trxs. I'll have a look again at how it could be programmed app specific for signing. Maybe look at the underlying chip (STMicroelectronics ST23YT66).
edit: oh, had a look at tech docs. It mentions built in crypt accelerator but seems only for DES and SHA1.
edit: I'm familiar with PIC asm, have the prog. tools and some chips laying around so it's pretty easy for me to explore using this. It's also widely available to others without middle men (buy from microchip) so I'm leaning this way.

There is a set of rules base on several factors and trx size being one. See that link I gave as it mentions it briefly and has a link to the wiki page with details. I believe the bitcoin client calculates the fee and asks for your confirmation before sending. Other clients may differ but in the end the miner will prioritize depending on fee per KB size and put the best paying ones at top and only include lower paying ones if there is space. So if you don't mind it taking a while you can send for lower or no fees.

Bitcoin is caught in a real "wait and see" state right now. On the one hand it's easy to be negative given it's decline over the last year, and on the other it's easy to be positive when you look at the investment in building out related products, services and ideas. 
One of the most compelling use cases is getting no attention at all as far as I can tell. Unbanked potential users in developing nations are not going to be looking for high priced yuppie stuff from expensive web sites in the USA/EU. What they need is access to cheap Chinese products shipped direct (as they can see on ebay but have difficulty getting). I live in one of these developing countries and often, even with shipping, it's cheaper to buy off ebay from HK or China, than locally, and for me it's not a problem because I have a cc and US bank etc. But for others they have several barriers. Language, trust, suitable accounts and documentation. Bitcoin could really tap this for some enterprising sellers but it's going to require a substantial investment in marketing the idea that people can pay this way to people who barely conceive of ever shopping online, and it probably won't happen until some established market takes the plunge - ebay or aliexpress, and then promotes it to users in places that currently have trouble buying. I once paid for $2300 worth of product from China with bitcoin, but I had to go via a trusted friend who sent a bank transfer for my btc. Quirky scenarios like this aren't going to build an economy. I really hope someone cracks this open.

Even if you generate new addresses you will need to be online to create the transaction since it needs unspent outputs info. But you don't need to take the seed online. You get the MPK from the offline wallet and create a "watch-only" online wallet that will update with all past transactions and restore the needed unspent outputs. Then create your trx there and save it (or show qr code if you can capture a qr offline) to usb stick to take to the offline system for signing. I've done this a few times now and it sounds harder than it is - the save, go offline, sign, bring back, only takes a minute to do.

@_date: 2014-06-27 12:23:36
You need the original text, the signature and the address. The verify function needs all three to say "Valid". It's not technically encrypted. It's simply "signed". It's similar to signing with GPG. Normally you would use the public key but in the case of Bitcoin they arranged it out so that only the address is enough.
You can play around with this using a dummy wallet on blockchain.info or other wallet sites.

Actually if they had chosen a random number you could not trust it as it could only look random and you would not know if it had special properties. By choosing a known simple number you can be sure that it's extremely unlikely to have special unknown qualities. Do a bit of historical research on why the numbers were chosen. There are many independent cryptographers that put little merit in these numbers being weak. 
It's the kind of thinking that people like Alex Jones come up with to scare monger. Not that the NSA doesn't have very real powers, it's just it 's very unlikely to be a trick in SHA256 operation that has so far been undetected (not for lack of trying).
Hash initial values: first 32 bits of the fractional parts of the square roots of the first 8 primes 2..19. Initial Constants: first 32 bits of the fractional parts of the cube roots of the first 64 primes 2..311. These values are better than choosing "random" values since random values could truly be weak by choice.

Rough numbers?
There's roughly 2^160 possible addresses. So to have a 50% chance of finding a specific matching key within 100 years you would need to check 2^160 / 2 / 100 / 365 / 24 / 60 / 60 keys per second, or 2.317195645×10³⁸. Each check involves a EC point multiply, a RIPEMD hash and 2x SHA256 hashes. So let's ignore the multiply and RIPEMD and assume they can be paralleled fast enough to keep up with modified hash hardware (super unlikely), then at a current (double) hash rate of 297,831,258 GH/s (2.97831258×10¹⁷), you would still need **roughly** (2.317195645×10³⁸ / 2.97831258×10¹⁷), or,
7.780229854×10²⁰ times the entire current miner network. And that's only 50% chance in 100 years... Hmmm.

A wallet created with a seed cannot be watch-only. To create a watch-only it has to be created with a "pubkey" or MPK (master public key). I presume when you say "created a new wallet" you mean "restored" because on the File menu it is the "Restore" option you need to choose, and option "restore a wallet", and then type in the seed words.

Most merchant sites will quote a time-limited price in BTC using some rate they accept. It's then up to you to send the requested BTC amount. Whether they convert at some higher/lower price or don't even convert is not your problem after that.

They would process all the transactions that the cartel isn't, and confirmation times would slow for most transactions. The cartel would be processing almost no transactions and become useless to the network. Quite possibly seeing this a majority of nodes would exclude their IPs and not relay transactions to the cartel, and not accept their blocks, cutting them out of the network and their income. This would be by consensus. I recall how last time a bitcoin-qt upgrade caused a hard fork and within hours by consensus for the good of the network the miners had sorted it out and moved on.

I would guess from what's said above that they chose to back track to the point closest after the Chinese forked legally and changed the license there so that others could not in future fork newer versions. ie. minimize versions available with old license. I'm not sure that makes sense given how many other users have likely already created forks on github after that date.
I would also note that while changing the license may not change behaviour of the Chinese, probably nothing will, it may create a basis for preventing future clones made in or sold in developed nations where laws may be enforceable. I would guess they consulted lawyers who said best to do as much as you can now to minimize future issues. 
They may be able to create sufficient legal standing to prevent the Chinese selling clones on eBay, or Amazon or other sites, which is significant if the market becomes more then just enthusiasts.

I had a similar 4 core 4gb vps and it also had very sluggish performance in any sort of db use. It's probably mostly due to throttling of your resources as they like these vps to only be used for light web serving so they share well with probably 32+ others.
If you are paying more than $20/mo. for that (which is highway robbery) then consider moving to a dedicated server where you at least know what you're getting. I did that and for $29.95 (takes btc) have 120 GB SSD, 2x4 core (16 thread) older cpu and 16GB ram. Much, much better for high intensity db work.
Incidentally what I'm using it for is to test, partly, an alternate electrum server / explorer / api implementation using mysql = 57 GB db + 65 GB sig data (which can be held on HD space or even S3). I will be hosting a new explorer site soon(ish), and then start testing the electrum server code (which is working but has seen very little testing). The electrum server on mysql can update a block in 2-3 seconds and uses gevent concurrency for client connections.
Let me clarify. My mysql db bitcoin node layer runs on a pruning bitcoind node. So it uses ~3GB for the node, 57 GB for data/indexing and segregates 65GB of sig data to read-only low speed storage. I currently put this partly on S3 (only very old blocks) because that is cheaper (0.023/GB/mo) than paying for another hard disk on the server. So overall I have a fully indexed sql layer that uses ~50% of a normal non-txindex bitcoind node. I call that a win. It is an open source project on github: [sqlchain](
I tried running it on a cheap vps but the indexing is just too much. It will run well on a Vultr 2GB vps (takes btc)(and index a new block in 2-3 seconds) but only after full-sync-indexing on one of their high end dedicated vps instances. It just takes too long to catch up otherwise.

There are licenses they could have used that allow inspection but not producing a copycat product. See [MS-RSL shared source licenses]( etc.
Not that those licenses would prevent Chinese copying but at least there would be a handle to hold onto for moral arguments, and maybe someday (too late) there could be some enforcement available in China.
Maybe it could be a basis for preventing import into some countries, as they do for other knock offs.

And I'm saying that thousands of MtGox customers withdrew through Dwolla during that time frame. So you cannot link all cash outs to Karpeles or MtGox itself unless you split out the ones actually their own and not their customers. At that time it was one of the only ways of getting USD out of MtGox and many people opened Dwolla accounts for that purpose. Maybe they have a list of 1000s of pages of transactions that were specific to MtGox but I highly doubt that. It is almost certainly a list of their customers if it is that long, and they would have to filter it down to names that are connected with Karpeles (or aliases) cashing out. That may be hard as the large customer activity makes a great place to hide his own activity.

A solo miner (or a pool, but not someone mining at a pool) can alter the mining code to select transactions as they choose. But that only affects the block they (try to) mine and any other miner has the same control over their blocks, so statistically the result depends on the overall fraction of miners choosing to select by any given criteria. ie. if only one miner chooses to not include some trx then it will have negligible effect unless he happens to be a large pool. Hence, if ghash.io decides on some criteria it has significant effect, but even so if others choose differently then the net result is only a delay in trx confirmation.

How much effort you put into this depends on the amount involved and how much that amount means to you. My preferred way is to use Electrum on a Raspberry Pi offline. You can import the key, pay it to a regular seeded address or anywhere else knowing the change will return to your Electrum wallet and be safe. This isn't hard or expensive. Write down and keep the seed safe. But I can understand if the amount isn't large then simpler methods may be fine too.

If I understand your question you are wanting to do this from a public key without knowing the private one. And that won't work with most key standards available, like SSL, GPG etc. 
If you know the private key, and it's 256 bits, or adapted/truncated to 256 bits, then you could use that as a private key for generating a bitcoin address. But since Bitcoin uses a different EC curve than the other standards you will not have the same private key for the known public key, and hence any signature would be different. The key owner would not be able to spend from an address based off such a known public key.
I guess you were thinking of a way of basing public addresses off existing public info. Given the problems with address re-use that's not a great idea anyway. 
It may be feasible to use a known public key as as form of MPK for generating deterministic addresses. I haven't explored that. Perhaps using a different curve (as first step) for that may work since the MPK is typically combined with sequence inputs and hashed to create chained key pairs. 
In such a use case you would generate addresses until an unused one is found and send to that. The key owner could generate the private keys to match and claim the funds. But as said, I have not explored if that works out.

When entering an existing seed mine was slow but not that slow, and it got the wrong addresses. But for a watch only wallet from xpubkey it went away forever. Gave up waiting to see if it would come back. Copying a wallet file from desktop to mobile and then opening was pretty much instant (after app start up) and had correct addresses. Copying a watch-only wallet file over also opened quickly with correct addresses.
Incidentally creating an unsigned trx on mobile and scanning the QR code on my desktop (for signing) seemed to work. It got the data right but I didn't actually finish the signing. I'll have to test that soon.
@_date: 2016-03-09 16:39:23
I figured maybe that was the case. As long as the program works correctly I guess it is more secure (unless someone roots your phone after stealing) but also much less functional right now. 
So, how can I delete a wallet now? There is apparently no option in the program and I'd like to remove an older watch-only wallet.

Ctrl/Cmd-N is correct but then after you give it a wallet name it will ask if you want to restore or create new. You would choose "restore". But the determining factor whether it is watch-only is whether you give it a "seed" or "master public key (pubkey)". A seed will look like a bunch of words (and restores a full wallet) but the latter will be a string of encoded digits either starting with "pubkey" or sometimes older ones are just hex digits (which gives you a watch-only wallet).

I've not heard of a device like that but I could build one for you. The parts would be pretty cheap but my time less so. I don't mind saying how you could do one if you wanted to spend the time.
I'd buy an ESP8266-12E module on eBay for ~$1.50 and interface it to a small LCD module also on ebay for about $3-5 depending on size. The ESP8266 is a small wifi based 32 bit processor module. You can program it in C or Arduino style Lua on NodeMCU. Lots of info about both ways online. It needs to query your address on a blockchain API and update the screen. There is ready made LCD output software around as well. It would be a nice little project tying together a few different but fairly accessible bits of code. You'd probably want either a micro usb port for power or a small battery (probably a Li-Ion as it takes a bit of power unless you purposely have the cpu sleep and only update once every minute or so; buy a 1-cell usb power bank box and attach to that, $1.30 plus battery).
Anyway, that's a very cheap way using wifi. Much cheaper than a Rasp Pi with LCD but maybe more work to throw together. It could be made more fancy too, like cycle thru several addresses or use an Electrum MPK and sum up all addresses in the wallet (asking an electrum server). You could manage it with a small web app front end on your browser much like a router control panel.

BTW those IP addresses on blockchain.info mean nothing and aren't related to your own IP. They are the IP of the node that they first saw the trx. Which means it's the node where your trx may have possibly been first relayed or maybe 2nd relayed or maybe 100th relayed. They try to peer with many nodes to get the first IP but even then it's not your IP unless you run a node and peer directly with them. Slim chance for you.

If you really want it you could create a wrapper script that does it.

In Electrum you have a seed which is usually written down or presented as 12 or 13 words. With this you can restore your wallet even if the wallet file is lost.
If you have the wallet file then you need a password (if one was assigned when created) to gain access to the encrypted seed that allows you to spend.
You can also use a menu option to view a "master public key". That can be used to create a watch only wallet. That allows generating new addresses and watching transactions but is not enough to be able to spend.
Addresses are not private keys and are not seeds either. Private keys are always kept secret otherwise funds could be spent by anyone with access to the private keys. With Electrum both private keys and addresses are generated from the seed.
It goes like this:
Seed -&gt; Private Keys -&gt; Addresses (only addresses should be public).
You should look for the 12 or 13 word "passphrase" to regain access to the funds. Or if you have the wallet file and password that also allows access to the funds. But a watch-only wallet file has been de-seeded and is not sufficient for spending funds.

Not really sure why you're telling me that as I already do it that way. I wouldn't say it's more expensive though. I use my rasp pi for a media center and just swap the sd card for my wallet when I need to sign a tx. Zero added cost (well, I have a lot of memory cards around so don't count that). However, the trade off is that it is a bit less convenient than a Trezor. I was going to get a Ledger HW.1 to see how that works in comparison but I only want one with an Electrum design and they were already sold out.

Electrum is great on the desktop but I think they're having issues initially on Android. For me at least, address generation is taking... forever. Someday it may be great on Android too but I'm seeing a lot of complaints about crashes and speed. I hate to say it but I'll have to uninstall because I simply cannot wait ~forever~ for addresses. Even app start up is very slow.
edit: another thing - entering seed words from the desktop version doesn't create the same wallet on the mobile - different addresses. But, copying the wallet file over does allow using the same wallet - same addresses. Weird. May be different seed versions / word lists.

In actual fact the address it goes to is determined by the software used to create the tx. So if that software is a typical wallet then it will usually send the change to another address in the wallet. 
You can form a tx that sends change back to the same address but most general purpose wallets don't do that because they are designed to manage a bundle of keys/addresses and using a new address provides better privacy. With a deterministic wallet the change address is generated from the same seed as the origin address (on a secondary sequence) and so you know that it will end up going to an address you also control.

Safer, not technically really, but less prone to user error, yes. 
If you have the seed and know which software generated the wallet then you can always restore your wallet even if all the keys and addresses are lost. In theory you can make up a seed from any value (it is just a number after all), preferably very random. Your seed could be a grocery list. In practice for most people using readily available software like Electrum, Mycelium, Copay or many other "HD" wallets is best. 
I like Electrum because it's easy to install on a usb boot offline system, create a seed, write it down and keep safe. Then export the "master public key" to a usb drive and import on a desktop (or Android Electrum) and use as a watch-only wallet. I've been using an offline wallet this way for several years and it only takes a extra few minutes when I need to spend from it.

They get transaction fees even now but currently it is a small part compared to the reward. Eventually as the reward decreases the fees will be the major part of their revenue. The expectation is that by the time the reward drops the volume will be high enough that even low fees will pay well. And of course, difficulty drops as miners drop out so that it self corrects to be easier. If the fees are too low you get less miners, if too high, you get more miners. So you should end up paying fees appropriate for the implied security.

Yes, it's a brain wallet. Brain wallets are only bad in so far as how easy they are to find. Choosing phrases from literature, songs or whatnot in the pubic domain is poor because it's not random, it's easy accessible, and constantly being scanned. And probably now the blockchain will be searched too. 
The number of hashes in the blockchain makes it a much, much bigger search space. You're choosing data from what may be the biggest collection of random data, permanently stored and instantly accessible, in existence. The main advantage is that you cannot lose it without also losing it's relevance. And there's an infinite number of ways of combining and layering the data.

All nodes, including miners, get all txs. Miners can choose which txs they wish to include based on size and fees or whatever they like. They can even mine empty blocks if they like.
It is possible for a tx to only hit one miner but it's very unlikely and not a good thing for the tx sender (as they will wait longer for cfm). It would require the miner to not relays txs and for the sender to direct it at just that node. That is not normal behavior for bitcoin nodes and the node would need special patches to cripple it.
Typically txs get relayed around the whole network within seconds. Some miners may not immediatley start mining it but include it in their next midpoint calc. Almost all miners now are pools because the odds of finding a block solo are incredibly low. By pooling resources each pool member can get a more consistent though lower income. Each gets a portion of a found block based on how many shares they mined towards the pool total. This reduces payout but increases odds of being paid. The odds are so low now that GPU mining is pointless (costs more in elec than possible payout) and even small ASIC farms make only small amounts.
It has almost always been the case that holding BTC makes more than mining except in a few cases when buying in at market peaks.

Just tried to create a new watch only wallet from mpk QR code and it failed. It took a long time to generate addresses, ended up with a blank history and then closed suddenly. The QR code was from a watch-only wallet on my desktop Electrum 2.6.
After re-opening the program and selecting Wallets, &lt;name&gt;, Open it stopped a while and closed the program again. I really hate to say this but this program is not ready for general use. And it's not functional without being able to copy wallet files currently. Sorry - deleting for now. I wish I could help with dev work (as I did a few years back) but I'm too busy now.

@_date: 2016-03-05 07:55:28
I just tried it again. I opened my desktop wallet and selected Wallet, Seed. After password it showed the words. I entered them in the Android wallet and double checked them. It took about 30 seconds to generate addresses. The history was blank and next address did not match the desktop wallet. There should be quite a long history. Unfortunately this is an active wallet so I cannot give you the seed. The same wallet when opened as a file copied from the desktop does work and provide the same history. It's a shame the history list in limited in length - if I scroll down it always stops at about 8 entries instead of several dozen that should be there.
After doing this the wallet closed itself after a short time. I re-opened it and selected the test wallet I had created above. It has some history entries now. But they are half unverified and the program shut down after a short time again. This repeatedly happens. The screen just vanishes after a short time, maybe about 30 seconds. The restored test wallet is 46k but the copied file for the same wallet is 95k. Sometimes when I open the test wallet it has verified some history and they are old trxs from last summer. The generated next address is in fact one from my desktop history in the past. I would deduce that perhaps it is crashing on the restore/verify process on old trxs. The test wallet file size is not increasing so maybe it cannot get past some particular old trx.

Not sure what you're calculating with: t? 215,000? /2? But whatever those are I'd expect you're way far off because the first thing you'd do is build a frequency tree of words in the book and then work thru those, most used first, exhausting each word count and then adding one and repeating. It probably wouldn't take long at all with a GPU (or few) doing the hashing.
@_date: 2019-03-27 21:08:36
The first tx in every block is mined coin outputs. If you click on a block# in explorer you should see list of txs in it and first is "coinbase" mined coins.
If you are asking if you can tell if you can identify if someone has sent you coins they mined themselves you can never really know that. Almost all miners mine for a pool and a pool generally mines coins to itself and then splits later for payout to it's members. It used to be years ago that Eligius (sp.?) pool split directly mined coins to members but I know of no other pools that did that. Mined coins have to wait 100 blocks before being spendable so most pools mine to their own account and payout from existing btc holdings. It's a pretty safe bet that coinbase outputs are to an address owned by a pool.

An unconfirmed transaction is in limbo. The btc have not "moved" until it's confirmed, and nodes will drop the transaction from their "mempool" after some period of time. If you send another transaction using the same inputs with a higher fee then it's possible, likely even, that it will get confirmed first and the original one dropped. Most wallets won't let you send a second transaction while the original is still being monitored but it is possible by using a second wallet or other workaround. There is no process which reverses transactions - it's simply a matter of an unconfirmed one not being accepted by the network as valid until it's confirmed, and under certain circumstances the network can change it's mind (read up about forks).

To your second question - the sequence of words that some wallets give you is not generally for a private key (thought that is in theory possible too). Usually the words are for a seed which is used as the start point for algorithmically generating a sequence of keys. This is called a deterministic wallet and is much preferred nowadays for flexibility. 
Since you can generate a whole wallet (many keys) from the seed you are safer with regards to "change" from txs. And you can generate a master public key from the seed that allows you to safely monitor the whole wallet (key sequence) from online. You can create new addresses online for receiving txs without having the seed or keys. 
While writing down or printing a single private key is not totally terrible you gain quite a bit of flexibility by using a deterministic seed instead. The only real downside is that there are a few incompatible formats for the seed and you need to remember which software you used to create it. Electrum is an awesome wallet that uses seeds but is not compatible with many others.

@_date: 2018-10-19 03:17:00
You can't. An xprv is a master key derived from a seed and is used to generate a sequence of private keys. If you have a WIF / Base58 key then it could have been generated from an xprv but you cannot get an xprv from it. Not a meaningful one anyway. 
If you got the WIF key from a wallet then you'd have to go back to that wallet to get xprv that was used to generate it. For example, in Electrum you can use menu Wallet, Seed to see the seed and depending on the wallet type also an xprv. 
An xprv needs to be kept secret so don't ever enter it online or give it anyone as they could steal from all keys that are generated from it (not just a single key). An xpub is a different matter. There are cases where you may need to give that out or used it to create a watch only wallet.

It will depend on which hardware device but for Trezor One I can say that it works fine with Linux and Android (I use both). Being online depends on which wallet software you use. For wallet.trezor.io (the one made by the company) it's a web app so you'd be connected. For Electrum you can use it on Linux even without being connected (but won't see current state from network of course). It maintains balance even when the hardware is not plugged in and you can use it "watch-only" (that is, view balance, addresses, create txs but not sign/send). Other wallet software that supports a device may be slightly different in function but usually pretty similar. I've used Electrum extensively and trezor.io just a few times. Both work well enough. Electrum is more advanced but trezor.io is simpler and tailored to the device rather than being more general purpose.
All the hardware devices I have seen so far do not connect directly online themselves but depend on some software. It's certainly possible to make a device that goes online but also unnecessary when almost everyone has some computer or phone.
You wouldn't add it as "wallet" on bitpay and don't need to. I think there are some web sites that provide for that but I'm not sure if that's just as login device (to prove credentials) or possibly as a wallet. I mean, it's possible for them to build a web app into their site that can use your device to sign any outgoing txs. I guess that reduces the need for wallet software but also ties you to that site. In general though you use wallet software provided by the hardware company or by a third party like Electrum or Mycelium (which both can work with Trezor and other devices). So viewing balance and feature set are determined by the software. For specific info on a device I'd look at info on the hardware wallet site.
The main purpose of the hardware is to keep the private keys (actually the seed) safely stored where no malware can access it. It needs to have a small screen so you can verify details when a signature is made to spend btc. Most of the interface and transaction tracking is done in software as doing it there isn't a security breach.
@_date: 2018-10-27 20:39:54
It's hardly a lie. I'm certainly not a bcash'r and have never even owned any, nor want to. The fact is to push a double spend on the network you pretty much need to broadcast them simultaneously into differing nodes. If you have ever tried waiting even a short time and sending a 2nd changed tx (and I've tried this myself several times) then you quickly see it always gets rejected as most nodes already have a conflicting one in their mempool. RBF provides a way to bypass this, and that's fine and sometimes useful, but it means a merchant then needs to allow that nodes won't by default be dropping the conflicting tx.

Yes. Either by the device checking it generates the same wallet or by wiping the wallet and recovering from scratch over again. Either way you get the same wallet with balance proving you didn't make a mistake writing down the seed.

Yes. He means get familiar with how it works and prove to yourself it does work before you start adding significant funds. The Trezor One (and maybe others) have a recovery verify function that allows entering the seed words and testing it matches the one in the device. You can also just wipe the device and enter seed words  again to verify the funds are still shown in the wallet. These are all good things to do to gain some trust in your understanding and the wallet functioning. You don't want to be doing something for the first time when big bucks are at stake.

Some time after you created that wallet they upgraded wallets to be an HD type of wallet. I don't know what you have to do but I'd suggest contacting their support. Presumably they have some way of getting access to old wallets. Maybe there is a "legacy wallet" page somewhere on their site. The old wallets were a collection of private keys whereas newer HD wallets generate all the keys from a seed value. I used to use their wallet briefly many years ago but have not kept up with their service. Best of luck though. It should be feasible to recover that wallet or even just a single key that has the btc stored on it. I'd be careful about where you type in that recovery password though - don't trust any third party site or offer.
@_date: 2018-10-24 20:43:02
Possible. It was sent from my Electrum Android wallet and I think it may prompt asking if you want RBF but I don't recall what I chose. If so, then the POS system should let the vendor know it's been detected but not a sure thing rather than just not seeing it at all. The poor checkout guy was flummoxed by what to do. Make my burrito or not, others waiting in line. I waited aside while a half dozen others were served before the manager came and was confused too, because she thought I already had my food and wondered why I was concerned it hadn't been paid. Being at an airport with an abundance of cameras and security you'd have to be nutty to try a double spend for a $9.90 burrito.

You are so wrong in almost every way, both about LN, and how Bitcoin works. 
Forks have nothing to do with confirmation or tx calculation times. For one thing miners can recalculate the midstate for new blocks instantly - less than a fraction of a second because all they do is add new txs to the block and update the merkle root - probably less than a few hundred hashes and they can still mine while they update, so it costs zero time/effort to add new txs to a block.
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:53:53
Most likely you will be prevented from sending the second tx with higher fee unless the first one had RBF (Replace By Fee) flag enabled. This is because the second one will be seen as a double spend (it spends the same outputs) and the node you send on will reject it.
When you mark a tx as RBF then nodes will relay the second one and miners who support RBF (which is probably most now) will replace the tx with the higher fee one as soon as they see it. RBF is not usually default and many wallets don't even support it.

A phone isn't the only way. Copy [Tails to a usb stick]( and boot on that. Make an Electrum wallet and write down the seed words and store safely. Or make a paper wallet. Many good tutorials around and both these methods take mere minutes longer than a phone wallet.

Ya, there's a lot of info out there. I'd suggest hands on doing it with small test amounts and then once you've "got it" figured move on to using it more fully. It works beautifully and easily once you get it.

With a hardware wallet you NEVER type the seed into a computer or online. That would defeat the purpose of the device. I know the Trezor provides a way to recover from seed without typing it into the computer by selecting options on the teeny screen.
A balance as shown on screen by your wallet is simply the sum of "coins" your wallet knows are not yet spent. Same with real life. You keep various bills in your leather wallet and the sum of those bills is your "balance"; what you can spend. But with Bitcoin the bills are not $5,$10,$20 values but actually the amounts of your previous transactions (called "outputs").
So if you rec'd 1.2btc and later another 2.1btc then those are the "coins" associated with your addresses. The wallet sums them up to show you 3.3btc balance. When you spend, say 0.5btc it will select one, probably the 1.2 output and create a new tx with 0.5btc going to the address you tell it, but also 0.7btc coming back to you as "change", just like in a store when you spend a $5 bill for a $3.50 item. So after that in your wallet you have two "coins": a 0.7btc and the 2.1btc one, totaling 2.8btc (as expected).

I already wrote a Python compatible [Insight API]( that uses half the disk space based on mysql. I posted about it here (below) as well because even though, sure, lets have many, no one ever paid any attention to mine or gave me much feedback on it. But it has been up for 2 years as I slowly improve it. Now it supports Segwit and multiple interfaces including an Electrum server layer.

That sounds like a real node not a testnet one?

I don't know how you figured that but with pay-to-many txs and careful fee paying you should get away with a lot less than that. Certainly a lot less than if you went to your bank or Paypal and tried to pay 150 million $1 transfers. 
Off the top of my head with todays fees and assuming you don't need next block confirmation (as if you could get 150 million txs into a block anyway) I'd expect more like 1-2 cents per output and the max outputs (assuming segwit of course) you can have is roughly 32,000. So it would take 4687 txs - which would take on average 32 days of single tx full blocks to confirm (and really have reddit going nuts plus fees would go up as others fought for space, so this is purely theoretical).

With 50:1 margin and bitcoin volatility your "investment" is your fee. So, yes, they'll find another way to make money but I'm not sure regular old honest commissions are how.

Bitcoin was not designed to pander to miners needs. They either quit or mine by their own choice - it's not up to the network to keep them profitable.
Mining was always a marginal profit business where efficiency is the edge that allows some to remain while others quit. Tx fees have almost no bearing on this. At best it affects when the less efficient will drop out, and once difficulty adjusts the remaining are more profitable as before. I'm saying this as someone who mined for 3 years and designed and built my own ASIC hardware.
Miners do not enforce anything on the network - it's the nodes who form a consensus by **choosing** to relay or not relay blocks. 
And in the case of Segwit your premise is wrong anyway. Segwit will allow many layers on top of bitcoin that will all require fees. It enables the expansion of the range of uses for Bitcoin to world wide scales and that will only increase overall tx volume.

Now blocks are usually almost full so miners choose to include txs with higher fees first. That means those paying less have to wait on a space available basis. I remember sending zero fee txs many times but no more.

Those internet costs make me choke. I pay $18/mo and certainly don't intend to multiply that just to run a node.

Not sure about that site but many Canadians use [QuadrigaCX]( in Vancouver and they aren't that bad... just had a glance now and spread is $8 CAD (but obv depends on vol traded).

blockchain.info is a bit of a hybrid between web wallet and user controlled wallet. Their problem is a history of poorly written code, vulnerabilities, and being already targeted for MITM and phishing attacks.
Most of us who have been around for years would highly recommend getting btc off that wallet and into an offline/cold wallet alternative. 
It's not so hard. Stick some linux variant (eg. Tails, Ubuntu, Debian whatever) on a bootable usb stick. Boot and create an Electrum wallet. Write down the seed words and store safely. Save the xpub (master public key) as well because you can use that on your desktop to create new addresses and monitor your offline wallet.

No, you understand correctly - you just underestimate the incredible size of 2^128 as a probability. Even all computers on Earth guessing faster than possible would take far too long to find a single btc output. Amazing what you can do with a few coin flips!
Imagine 1 billion computers guessing 1 billion seeds/second (they may guess faster but they can't verify if they hit a known address nearly this quickly). That is 10^9 x 10^9 seeds/sec or 10^18 s/s. 
Now divide 2^128 by the current count of known addresses with btc (~1 million) to get probability of hitting any btc at all (and assuming many don't share a seed, which many would be). Then divide by our guess rate 10^18,
2^128 / 10^6 / 10^18 = 3.4 x 10^14 seconds
Or, about 10,790,283 years. And that is chance of finding even one seed with a balance carrying address. Hope someone doesn't spend it before then. ;)
But there is another way - you need an [Infinite Improbability Drive](

My node just crashed. After a week of syncing, and ~60 blocks staying in sync. At 449395 it just got an Exception and went screwy after that. I didn't notice and then shutdown for some other reason. When I started up again it couldn't continue. Now it suggests using --reindex or --reindex-chainstate. This is a pruning node. Is reindexing going to mean downloading from block 0 again? I have the debug logs and thousands of error messages in there but no idea how to interpret. God. I really don't want to spend another week syncing again.
btw my pruning node had 408 MB of blocks and 2.6GB of chainstate. Tried --reindex-chainstate and now that is zero. But seems to be stuck, getting many network unreachable errors, and on block 0.

Trezor 1 will work on Android with cable (maybe not even OTG as I have used a normal charging cable and it worked). The problem is Mycelium is the only software that seems to support it and it only has "Legacy" accounts (non-segwit). They say this month Mycelium will update and support Segwit. Who knows. They used to be good and now not many like it but it still works ok. I wish so much the Electrum-Trezor connection would be ported to Android but it's not my expertise niche to do it.
@_date: 2018-10-31 05:21:39
I guess I threw a bit of jargon in there :) This is "under the hood" but good to know for clarity as how Bitcoin works.
The way your wallet knows it's "balance" is not by storing a balance as such but by calculating it every time using all the transactions it finds connected with the addresses it knows are yours. So it goes online and gets tx data. Then it checks the txs that have not already been previously spent (we call them UTXOs - Unspent Transaction Outputs) and sums them up. That gives it a list of "coins" still spendable and the data it needs for creating a new tx (send some btc), and that sum is your balance.
When you send some btc the wallet selects which UTXOs to combine into a new tx and then signs that data and broadcasts it to the network. With a hardware wallet that signing step is done in the device because it never lets the keys get out (for security reasons). In normal software wallets the signing is done in your main cpu and because the keys are on the system they are potentially accessible by malware also running hidden on the system.
If that's not coming clear then don't fret. It will eventually make sense after a month or two more reading... just kiddin. But ya, back in 2011 it took me a while to really understand how it works. From a user perspective you may not need to really know except it's not the same as a bank. The "transaction ledger" is in the cloud and your wallet only knows where to find it and how to do it.

That's very interesting because I'm working on a sql layer over bitcoin. And before my node crashed I had the entire chain indexed in mysql on several indices and total space (with pruning node) was 122GB. I'm building an explorer and new electrum server code on top of this. Once it syncs fully the mysql db keeps up very well. Each new block takes less than 1-2 seconds to update. I wanted above info to make some comparisons about disk space with full indexing.

It's fine if this is based on the open source Trezor hardware but users/buyers should be aware that isn't enough to mean it is "as safe". You would have to verify the hardware and load the bootloader  yourself to be sure that it isn't hacked in some way. That requires a small $5 tool and a bit of time to compile/download plus some tech savvy. Otherwise you are trusting this maker and that's not the same as Trezor's history and reputation.

A hardware wallet is just like a normal software wallet except you need the device plugged in when "signing" (sending) a pmt. A hardware wallet will use software (either on your system like Electrum, or web based like trezor.io, or Android/iOS app) to manage the actual hardware access and normal uses.
So, just like using a software wallet you will have an address you give others to pay you. It will change after each use so they aren't normally re-used (though they can be if privacy is not paramount). Also, when paying others you will get an address from them and paste it into your software to pay. The wallet cannot send until you plug in your hardware, confirm PIN, then verify tx details on the device.
There are other ways to safely use Bitcoin but a hardware wallet is the best combination of safety and simplicity for most non-tech users. If you plan to eventually save and have a lot of BTC then I'd suggest you get one. Trezor makes a good low-cost unit (which I use) and others are available at higher costs.
Regarding Visa and Bitpay - I don't know how that works but presumably you send BTC to their address to fund a Visa card, or withdraw BTC from them to your address. Holding BTC in their card or wallet is dependent on them behaving. Holding BTC in your own hardware wallet only depends on you. 
Always make a seed phrase backup when setting up a new wallet. Keep it safe on paper stored securely as that is the way you recover from lost/stolen/damaged devices.

Actually seeing fiat price according to my choice of exchange is best. I can immediately see if the amount the *vendor is charging in BTC* is close to my idea of market rate or way off. It lets me double check that it's close enough for me or back out without having to get out the calculator and manually verify (which is more prone to error even is less trusting). I don't expect it to be exact; only close enough I'm not being gouged.

That's a crazy price. 
If you're handy with electronics you can build your own Trezor. I was going to do it but it's not worth the time unless you can sell some to friends or something. My parts cost from mouser here in Australia would be about $25 AUD each including PCBs, CPU, display and other parts. Not for everyone of course but I've built a few SMD projects over the years and know how. All the PCB files, firmware code etc. is on github and here's [someone]( who posted his experience. This way you have ultimate knowledge of what's in the box (helps to have a 3D printer to make the little case). Even the old Trezor is pretty functional and easy to use.

Partly, maybe. It depends what type of email. If a Gmail account then it's sitting on their servers even if you delete it, and may be recoverable. And if it's a local email client then there will be remnants of it on your hard disk even if it's deleted in your email client folders. But certainly deleting it is better than not doing that. 
I guess you're using Windows (not linux), since you mention notepad, so there's probably untold ways it may be lingering somewhere. I have knowledge about how to scan a drive under linux to detect any remnant but not under Windows.
Honestly, if the value is significantly high for you, then I'd recommend creating a new wallet where the seed words have never been online and sending btc to that wallet. I'm not sure if Copay has offline options.

If txs can stay in the mempool for 2 weeks (default) then you don't need to increase at a high rate to accumulate a lot of dead crud propping up the minimum workable fee level. My math may be off but 2 weeks ~ 2016 blocks, so to maintain 50,000 txs steady never confirmed txs you only need to add 25 per block.

Install Electrum, select menu File, New. Type a new file name. Select Standard, "I have private keys". Paste your keys in there. This creates a new "import" wallet holding your old keys. You should see your history sync with any txs you have done on those keys. You need to backup the wallet file. 
Ideally you would create a Standard wallet (create new seed) and move your btc there. That way your new wallet is entirely secured by the seed words (which you write down) and doesn't depend on the wallet file.

Don't waste your time. A typical fee per input now is about 100 bytes * 70 sat. = 7000 satoshi. So any inputs smaller than that are costing you money to spend. A faucet will fill your wallet with tiny tx outputs that you won't want to spend because they will cost more than they are worth.

What a load of bunk.
I mean it starts out with a conjecture that an IP address associated with a tx has any connection with actual users. That's wrong right off. Even if you could listen to all nodes at once, which you can never assume, it ignores that any node could be relaying for an another, or injecting txs from dependent clients, as would Electrum servers, Mycelium servers, or any push tx page on an explorer, or Tor nodes which they may find quite impossible to connect to anyway. 
There are definite ways to associated addresses with users by having information provided by merchants or exchanges and associating addresses across txs (as shared inputs or change outputs). Maybe all the equations were trying to make some clever mathematical basis for that - I don't know. When I saw the article start out with a wrong basis for connecting users to addresses I didn't try to look deeper at the math, and I'm somewhat sure there was a bunch of equations sprinkled about to make it look like it all was valid and had some academic basis.

I doubt it. I very much suspect this is miner collusion. They can send txs and then purposefully never include them in blocks. All they need to do is throw the txids in a db and track them for exclusion. Click the 300 sat/byte legend to exclude lower fees and then you see that only above 350 sat/byte get included and only between 200-1000 txs/block, even after a big drop it does not include lower fees.
When segwit activates these txs will still be there. Since the mempool now holds txs for 2 weeks they will only need to resend such txs once every 2 weeks. As long as they don't include them in a block they cost nothing, and the chances of a new colluding miner including them appears to be very low now.
**I'd like to suggest someone resourceful do a malleability attack on some of them and resubmit with differing txid and see if they get included.**
But anyway, I'll be happy if you turn out to be right.

Short answer - currency controls. In China you have to sell for Yuan. Then you have to either buy btc or find another way to get your Yuan back into your home currency and out of China.

I think there is. LN nodes have to commit btc to at least some channels to be functional as a relay. That means having some btc to tie up and the opportunity cost and risk of not being able to sell it when a market panic  happens. That's great for bitcoin as a whole.
Eventually miners should see that LN holding btc in channels could be a stabilizer for the price and good for them along with everyone else. Nodes have to weigh the loss of fee profits against selling btc on the market - so in a sense it adds dividends to holding btc. Market forces should eventually equate the fees to the cost of tying up btc.

Dealing with US customers for any bank worldwide opens up a lot of hassles for reporting and tracking. Many banks prefer not to deal with the US govt and so deny US business. I don't know who BTCe does banking with. I'd guess it's some Eastern European bank(s) maybe in Ukraine that doesn't want to deal with the US govt. Or maybe it's the exchange themselves who just don't care for US scrutiny and oversight.
Also, I think there are few roundabout alternatives for getting money onto BTCe but they probably all take time and cost more. So that loss and time-risk (price could swing while waiting) probably accounts for much of the price difference. 
But mainly I'd say RISK aversion for anything but small sums being traded. You could think of it as maybe only the site operators and close associates really want to risk their fiat there and that limits the buying power.

It may initially be a disadvantage to tie up funds, but as the network gets established and more useful your funds will be more useful tied up rather than not. So it seems likely initially LN will lead to more txs on the chain, and later to both more on chain but much more off chain. And it looks plausible that tying up funds in a channel could also be revenue generating to a small extent. That aspect, probably far off, is attractive.

Except that's not how hostile takeovers work. They only need to gain a controlling interest not all outstanding shares, and usually not even close to that. Think 30% or so but it depends on who owns big chunks and whether they side with the takeover or against it. Plus they can acquire proxy rights on chunks of shares if a percent of shareholders agree.
In this case if a significant percent of amzn shareholders think amzn should accept bitcoin and thinks mgmt should be changed to support that view then they may assign proxies to the takeover company allowing them to have higher controlling interest without actually buying their shares.

The pmt protocol is a good thing as it helps to validate addresses to prevent MITM attacks. And Bitpay sucks in general, though they were at one time years ago at the cutting edge - now they are run by people who would rather you used non-Bitcoin alternatives (which suck of course, but anything for a buck). 
They should have a button you click to get the address and warn you that the address you are seeing may not match the one they intend you to see.

Private keys can be used no matter where they are. If they are still in an old wallet that was lost or stolen then they can be used by anyone who finds them any time. They don't expire or become unusable. 
You can always generate an address from a private key using math. You only need an address to send btc to it but you need the private key to spend from the address. 
So if you find the private keys you lost then SPEND the btc on them to a new address (not just import the keys) that you are sure ONLY you can get access to. If you cannot find the private keys, you cannot spend them but anyone else who may find them certainly can spend them (to their own address). Possession of private keys is full control.

Tx fees are market driven, they go up or down depending on how many others are competing for the same block space. Any gain from segwit will be a reflection of overall size reduction by overall user take up. 
You choose your fee and the miners select txs to fill blocks from the highest down. In the past they used fee per byte size as the selector to maximize return. With segwit the calculation is more nuanced as they measure witness data at a lower rate than other data. So segwit txs can be larger for the same fee as legacy txs, or cost less in comparison to legacy txs, but it's still the sender who chooses the fee and if they all choose higher fees then you are still competing for space against higher fees.

Only about a half hour before I discovered I needed it. This is all on a vps so no easy way to unmount and try forensics. So I guess it's just sync again then. Blah.
Pruned node state isn't that big so definitely worth having backup copies always.

Opening and closing is just a special tx on the blockchain. Presumably an enabled wallet would ask you for an amount to commit on a channel and then build and send the tx for you just it does now for normal txs. The wallet would need to manage the channel state, that is update the balance remaining and timeouts for closing, as you use it.
You wouldn't open a channel for a single pmt as that would just end up being 2 txs instead of 1 (open and close). But you might open a channel with a node you intend to use a lot (maybe a coffee chain, grocery store, petrol station) and commit some funds. The expectation is you would use it fairly often and that if it's well connected to other LN nodes you could pay anyone anywhere on the whole network via your open channel. The more complete that connectedness is the more useful your open channel, the more likely you would just keep it open and add new funds to the channel as you use them up.

You should make a QR code of the address and put that on the video so that viewers can point their phone at it to pay. And put the address in the comments where it can be copy/pasted. Very unlikely that viewers will enter it letter by letter while reading the screen. I've seen a few videos with a QR code at the end asking for support.
Use a different address for each video so you can track which ones pay. Take all video addresses from one HD wallet like Electrum (which gives you QR codes you can save to file) and then now and then move totals to another personal wallet (to a different address each time). Users can see you moved btc but don't know where or if you sent to someone else, an exchange or spent them. If you avoid re-combining outputs after they are in the second wallet then they cannot tell they went to only one wallet.

Electrum - choose File, New/Restore. Enter a filename to use, then Standard, then "Use public/private keys". Give it a password if you like.
For private keys it will make an "imported" wallet, not an HD wallet. You can create a tx from this wallet. You can do this offline on a linux boot usb stick for max security, or just on a desktop if a few minutes exposure isn't a worry (but once keys are on desktop they are no longer offline, of course).
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:21:19
Maybe, if there is demand. I think Electrum can do it already using locktime on cmd line, which should be fairly easy.
If chain A is faster and gets 20 blocks ahead you do a `payto address` cmd with `--locktime` at current block. That tx won't be valid on the slower chain B. Once confirmed on chain A it is then safe to do it again without locktime on the chain B, to a different wallet. The second tx will be valid on chain B but invalid on the faster chain A because it's a double spend.

I may be mixing something up (not yet fully clear) but here's my understanding of the situation. 
I believe in either case (FPGA/GPU) the processor would always be waiting on memory. The only performance gain you can make is to parallel the memory access to cut "effective" latency. On a GPU I think there is an established connection architecture (which I'm not very familiar with and could be wrong about) where you want to trade off bandwidth over latency because you have a given chunk of high bandwidth memory. If you have the memory wired for bandwidth you have already invested in that arrangement so the best choice is to maximize that. So naively I would guess the GPU can increase it's processing by using all 2.4GB and hitting 2.8x the simple latency based speed. I think I'm using the figures mentioned. This works because the GPU already has that memory connected that way. So for a given latency of, lets say, 9ns the best case is 9/2.8 (3.2) effective latency. I'm using 9ns as a stand in for whatever the real world value is but it's in the ball park and has not improved much over several generations of DRAM. 
In the next part I am assuming that an FPGA core design can keep up with memory. That would depend on a detailed look at the cuckoo code and I have not really done this yet. I did browse over it some time ago. Maybe the code is best "rolled out" as dedicated logic rather than using a sequential core, or some optimal combination.
On an FPGA you have the option of connecting DDR memory in a more optimal pt-to-pt layout (you cannot properly utilize pre-fetch and burst anyway due to non-sequential access). This is also how an ASIC would best connect to memory. If we assume the same 9ns latency memory but use 256MB chips (assume 2^30 mode, 200MB as you suggested) 4 deep (4 internal cores share one 8 bit bus to 4 DDR chips, each chip with a 200MB graph) then each group of 4 cores achieves 9ns / 4 effective latency but only at a cost of 1GB DDR (4x256). 
I mentioned that a cheapish XC7A35T ($30) can hold 25-30 risc-v cores. I reduced the count somewhat in expectation that also 4 simple-DDR controllers need to fit. So I came up with 16 cores as feasible. Maybe 20 or 24 could fit but I don't yet know. Lets' go with 16x for now. Then one FPGA has 4 x (4 core + DDR controller to 4 DDR3 chips). The overall performance would be 9ns / 4 / 4 (0.56) effective latency at a cost of 16 DDR chips and one FPGA. Using an estimate of $3/DDR we get something in the ballpark of $78 chip cost for an improvement of (3.2/0.56) 5.7x GPU speed. I don't know what a suitable GPU costs in comparison but probably much more. This is just a first step and rough plan. I should post a diagram to make it more clear, if it's not.
On the ASIC front the primary gain in this design is improving the cost/efficiency of the 16 core grid with mass production. And I agree it can do that but it is limited because much of the cost is in the RAM. From that perspective it would be limited even more by increasing RAM with a larger graph.
I would posit that an FPGA is a more ideal target platform than a GPU because any small company world wide can use off the shelf chips to produce miners whereas with a GPU it's more centralized at a company like AMD or Intel. From that angle it is better to use more RAM rather than less because it keeps the advantage more towards an FPGA design than optimizing further to an ASIC. If RAM required was 768MB then 3x the memory cost vs core cost reduces the gain of shrinking cores. In the original white paper one estimate was that the hashing processing accounted for only 5% overall performance. I think it's best to try to keep that as low as possible. An ASIC design could build RAM into the ASIC but to really advance it has to find a way to cut latency otherwise commodity RAM will be cheaper.
Anyway, I've run on and written too much now. Just wanted to make more clear why I think an FPGA design could out perform a GPU but not lag far behind an ASIC.

The silly thing is that if more BTC users just sold off their BCH the price would drop and it would no longer be profitable to mine BCH - problem solved for BTC (well, one problem anyway). Also, Coinbase holding onto user's BCH probably has a huge effect. There must be so many users who simply cannot sell their BCH even if they wanted. I'd love to see them implement an option to sell which users can click and verify by 2FA, that takes care of that step for them.

Not just connect to Tor but in the plans is onion routing of the LN circuits so that payees, payors and intermediate nodes will not know who each other are. Think about that, regardless of IPs being hidden, which is only one level of identity, now most of the economic activity goes dark and unprovable. That would be a huge reason for some actors (especially those doing analysis or interfacing with traditional banks) to try their best to bad mouth and discredit LN. 
One of the biggest failings of dark net markets has been risk of users losing funds due to exit-scams and take downs. With LN you avoid mixing, trusting the market wallet (still need some escrow agents), and risking your funds being confiscated.

Yes, I do think it would very much outperform any GPU in cost/performance. I'm not sure that an ASIC would greatly out perform an FPGA.

I think you know this but for others reading: the discount was based on the reality of memory usage cost. Witness data can be discarded once validated or even stored on disk whereas other tx data often needs to be in memory, or cached at least, at greater resource cost. So the idea was to ease the requirements for nodes so that it can still be something that is done without reward (unlike mining) for personal reasons / supporting the network. 
Maybe the real reason to attack the discount is that it helps keep Bitcoin decentralized?

It would be interesting to know. And if mixing is the reason we all have to pay high fees then the sooner some form of TumbleBit/LN/Onion Routing or similar privacy enhancement is brought online the better for everyone.

He's saying if you own BCH then you cannot get any "free" S2X coins (because that chain won't split). But if you sell BCH and get BTC, then when S2X happens you will have both BTC and S2X, and just need to do a split tx to protect/claim them.

I haven't looked at HBM2 details. At first glance it seems like it's designed to improve bandwidth. Since it costs more it would have to also decrease latency significantly to be worthwhile. When I first looked at cuckoo I didn't appreciate the difference between latency and bandwidth. It is critical because every access is dependent on the previous one. Most modern RAM is designed for increased bandwidth (pre-fetch/burst) but it's latency is almost the same as decades ago. If HBM2 reduces latency then it would possibly be ideal for cuckoo at some price. Both GDDR and DDR have non-page hit latencies of ~16 cycles which is the limiting factor. SRAM can do much better but is too expensive, and HBM2 would have to give some latency/price advantage.

I see from your other questions that you need to read a bit more Bitcoin primer material - how it works. It is not like a traditional bank account at all. 
At least you should know that wallets store keys that are used to sign transactions (txs). But the actual bitcoin ("coins") only exist as tx outputs on the blockchain. That is, they are not stored in your wallet. Your wallet has keys/address info that are used to check the blockchain and view existing tx data "out there". The blockchain is stored on thousands of connected nodes worldwide so that's where your coins are; duplicated records in every one of them for redundancy.
So your wallet software uses the seed to generate keys and then keys to generate addresses. And it checks online to see any unspent "coins" on those addresses and sums them up to give you a balance. You can recover your seed in another city to generate the wallet again and it will check online to see what "coins" are out there you own. That's why your seed backup is critical.
Once your wallet has a balance (sum of unspent tx outputs "UTXOs") it is able to spend bitcoin by taking some and "signing" a new tx with your keys. The only thing that is super important is the seed and your hardware device provides a place to store it and allow convenient signings (spends). You could simply keep the seed written on paper and stored safely but that wouldn't give you the ability to sign new txs. As soon as you type the seed into a computer it is potential at threat of malware designed to find and steal it.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:30:34
No.  Any node that drops a bad tx is preventing other nodes from having to likewise validate them. It spreads the load and short circuits bad data, plus it also greatly helps with privacy because any listening nodes cannot assume that the node sending them a tx is the originator of it. In preventing chain analysis not being able to accurately assign an IP address is good. 
I don't know where this new idea that nodes not doing economic activity are useless came from but I'm guessing it's a talking point for combating privacy and trying to stifle decentralization. In my 6 years here I've never heard so much effort to denigrate full node operation - so there must be some new reason.

I wrote a password scanner for Electrum. It's for standard bip32 wallet, which is what you'd have by choosing default standard wallet. You need the xprv value from the wallet file, and an example password with ? for missing values. It will find password fairly quickly for 2 chars but much longer for more. pm me and I can give you program and help you run it. If you have a reduced set of chars then it's much faster, eg. you know it's not full A-Za-z0-9.
It's a very simple script you can inspect before running - very few lines that loop over the aes decrypter call with correct data. I've tested it with 2 missing chars and it finds password and xprv value in a couple minutes (on a pretty slow old latop). You can manually set character set to scan and wildcard (?) to substitute.

Nation states could, and do, block the internet in their country but it would be very hard to block it tightly enough to make Bitcoin inoperable. They could make it a hassle but very likely not make it impossible. 
As one very simple example - it's very easy, and completely common, to open up an ssh connection across the net. Admins do this all the time to carry out work on servers or routers. But ssh supports secure tunneling (and proxying) as well that you can use to bypass any filtering because it's totally encrypted traffic. You can do tunneling over https as well. 
So the only feasible way is to totally block the internet, and I suspect that even then some users would find routes in/out of the country.

I think exchanges and node operators should really be looking at what opportunities they will have as potential LN nodes. This should be a reasonable revenue stream in future and another way to participate in Bitcoin other than being a miner. And miners are not excluded - no reason a miner cannot get involved in LN transaction relaying and make fees on top of simply mining. 
All three of these operators are already running nodes, interacting on the network and employing technical staff (paid or not). This looks to me like a far better decentralized outcome than just bumping block size and making the burden (without reward) on nodes and exchanges greater. Maybe some day block size needs to be increased but efficiency should be the first step because it lets more users and businesses participate at lower cost.

Mining a block stops when a certain number of zeros are found in a hash. So block hashes will always have a number of zeros determined by their difficulty. That's what makes it hard enough to take 10 minutes even when doing 6,284,351,807,000,000,000 hashes/sec as miners are today.
So why? Because it must, by definition.

It'd be pretty easy on linux. I guess on Windows too but I wouldn't have info handy.
On linux there's easy traffic shaping utils around which you could add to a cronjob to change parameters at 2am and 9am. I use one from core devs called bwlimit which I made a few changes to for my own use. I've stuck it in a [github gist]( if anyone wants it. You just need to adjust the limit values for your own needs. If you add this to two cronjobs, at 2am and 9am, you'd probably want to uncomment the "delete existing rules" lines, and duplicate with different limits in each copy.

Let's see. 
If a miner sends a single satoshi to many wallets, some portion will be never spent and some will. It costs approx. 34 bytes in fees to send but can be done when very cheap. 
Dumb wallets that do not drop these will spend them and add approx. 148 bytes in fees to a tx which may occur when fees are high especially on dumb wallets that don't estimate fees very well and lower them as demand eases.
**So it's very likely that 34 bytes @ 10 sat/byte cost (340 satoshis) will be repaid by 148 bytes @ 300 sat/byte (44,400 satoshis).** 
Any miner with less than 340 / 44,400 = 0.7% of hashrate is statistically likely to come out ahead and those with higher portions much more so. Combine that with percent of wallets that are too dumb to drop these inputs, which I have no idea how many do or not. It is possible to scan the blockchain and analyze how many of these tiny random outputs are actually spent compared to dropped.
PSA - Electrum allows users to freeze an address which is useful for making sure they do not get used as inputs. Unfortunately you cannot freeze specific outputs so if they piggyback on a address with a large output it's not as easy to prevent. I'd be curious if these tiny random outputs are not actually random but targeted at using an address that has a recent significant new output. 
Food for thought. This is basically having **users spam themselves** by leveraging dumb input selection in wallets.

You can create an Electrum watch-only import wallet from the address (scan QR code). 
Then you can create a tx to your friends address and save it to file. If there is any change, be aware of where you're sending it.
Then use an clean boot (usb stick) and install Electrum. Disconnect and boot offline. Then use the private key to create an Import wallet and load the tx from file. Sign it and save tx to file again.
Finally go back to your normal desktop and use Electrum to load the tx again and click Broadcast. That is totally offline and only 1 fee needs be paid.

I haven't heard of a specific meaning for Bitcoin. In general investment/speculation terms it means how much risk is being taken. The more some event will impact your position the more exposure you have. So if you hold no btc then your exposure (to btc related events) is zero; and if you hold 90% of your assets as btc then your exposure is very, very high.

If it's a miner expecting to make fees when spent then it costs zero fees plus only 1 satoshi. When you spend it your fee will be 148 bytes x current sat/byte = nice profit.

It's probably a matter of some user interface changes and then testing on mainnet to make sure things work as expected. But it's good to test thoroughly as no one wants to see buggy screw ups. And then we're bound to see tx volume increase as some people move btc and test out segwit wallets.

Nodes only relay **validated** txs and blocks. That is a useful function and helps the network by preventing propagation of bad data. The difference between injecting new txs and not is only it's utility for the node owner whereas filtering bad data is useful for everyone. The more nodes that better. 
Also, note that having relays greatly improves privacy as block analysis can never be sure of an originating IP address when it likely was relayed. For agencies trying to improve analysis of tx origin I can see that promoting the idea that running nodes is useless make sense but for users wanting more privacy it is useful.
@_date: 2017-08-07 13:45:03
If you want to keep it on a paper wallet then you should create a new one and send it there. The key you loaded into electrum is no longer a paper wallet - it's on your system and a compromise (malware) of your system could gain control of it even if encrypted either by key logger or by sending the key elsewhere and brute forcing the password.
There are other choices too. Like an electrum offline wallet or a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 02:13:52
If they know the private key then the btc on that address are not "safe", but without having more info (like the xpub or MPK) then they cannot calculate other keys you have. So they are safe. 
Your only worry would be if someone was generating BIP39 wallets and sending test txs to see if the wallet was in use. That would be a dumb ploy because once generated they can already just check addresses to know if some are being used, and with that you would already be wiped. Anyway, the chance of generating a random BIP39 wallet is so extremely low as to be zero.

Once you open a channel the funds are held on a timelock. Each tx is like writing an IOU on those locked funds. You pass that to the other end and at any time they could close out and take their funds (up to the amount you signed), so they don't have to risk being paid (and you refunded the balance) as long as they have a valid closing tx on hand. 
And your locked funds will get refunded automatically if the receiver end never sends the IOU you gave them. It's a last resort too because if you co-operate you can say you're done and they can close you out with the last total you signed.
So nothing hits the blockchain til the closing tx is posted but at any time before that a current channel state is held allowing closing. And there could be any number of those intermediate "IOU" signed txs, thousands even - they're just bits of signed code easy to transfer quickly.
Note - I'm trying to keep the language simple but there are write ups and videos on youtube that go into details more accurately.

This is why it's so very very important that a small group of business interests, like NYA signors, do not demonstrate control over the network. The only thing that gives Bitcoin global independence is the lack of central control. Once one country can exert control over the protocol it no longer is attractive to others due to interference with sovereignty; that is, no sovereignty is only acceptable when it is universal. It is in all users interest to ensure that a subset cannot exert their specific business interest, and today this manifests as demonstrating that miners do not control the network otherwise miners will be the tool govt uses to control Bitcoin. Nodes must HODL control by defining an actually decentralized network.

2FA adds a fee to each tx so if you expect to use it much keep that in mind. Personally I'd never even consider it. Even though you give 1 key to TrustedCoin you have two more that give you full control, but in that case why not just use multisig yourself and not pay any extra fees.
Multisig is safer, but mostly if one signor is an offline wallet. 
Standard is fine for small amounts since (of the 3 options) it is most at risk of malware. You can also use standard offline and just keep a watch-only wallet on your system. In that case it's pretty close to multisig in offline safety but a bit more convenient.
If this is just for you and no other signors involved then an offline standard wallet is probably best. You can create one using Tails or another linux usb stick to boot. There's many detailed tutorials around.

Seems the "evil plan" doesn't even need layer 2 services. It's profitable to carry out now as long as `fee sat/byte &gt; total_hashrate/(0.68*148*miner_hashrate)`. 
In fact, if miners filled their empty space with such txs it would be a major headache until wallets are fixed to ignore them.
Those charts are cool. The light blue utxo count is the one of interest. What I noticed is that from June 2016 to current it doesn't change that much, and is in the same ball park as my db query results. Wha's crucial is utxo count vs. txo (all outputs) to indicate how many are spent vs. ignored. As of June 2016 it was 68% - a value I find really points out how bad wallets are at ignoring utxos that cost more to spend than to drop. 
Eventually my db will sync and I'll have up to date figures. I should do some graphs of how the ratio changes over time to see if wallets on average are treating them differently. Right now I feel users are being "tricked" or "abused", since they aren't able to ignore the spam otuputs.

Geez. I already wrote a Python **[Insight compatible API]( that focused on using much less space (as low as half!) than the Bitpay one. It's been up for 2 years on Github with updates now and then. It's built on top of MySQL because that lets you do almost anything. I have a demo Explorer and Electrum server already written on top of the basic DB and API.
It hasn't seen enough testing but **it does work now** and a few users have forked it (maybe to test). No one ever cared or gave much feedback so I never put all-out effort into it. I did upgrade it for Segwit a couple weeks ago, and I'm testing that aspect on testnet right now along with Electrum server layer. 
If anyone checks this out and thinks "hey, we should make this into something better with more resources and effort" please get in touch. I haven't had the resources myself. It could be useful for some business as a backend with more testing and support.
It doesn't currently do payment processing - just the Insight API calls. It would be nice to extend it to manage a xpub based server wallet. I just haven't had time to focus on that.

Rushwallet is an odd kind of wallet. I only came across it yesterday when trying to help someone recover theirs. It uses the url (with text code) as it's "backup". So you save as bookmark.

Generally with LetsEncrypt you setup a cron job that calls "certbot renew" every so often (daily). This checks date and renews some time before expiry, an automated backend process. I don't know if that is handled in BTCPay maintenance and if not then you may need to dig through some admin tutorials for LetsEncrypt and set that up yourself. Once configured it just keeps you always renewed in time. On some linux packages (repo install with apt-get...) it adds the cron job during install so you don't have to manually do it if the correct settings were made for your web server (nginx,apache etc). There would be a job showing in /etc/cron.d which you can check for.

I have also thought of nutty ways like going down to my local bridge and scraping grooves into the cement post in a pattern that could be interpreted as hex digits. Now that's pretty crazy but very public and depends only on obscurity - 32 marks where the distance in cm between is the hex value - combined to make a 32 hex digit seed value for Electrum (it does allow creating a seed from random 32 digit hex value). You could do the same but on a tree in a local forest (as long as they don't cut down the tree).
In the end it really depends on the value involved and just how secure you really need it to be.

Right now there are 70,000 txs in the mempool which will probably not be included in a block and yet the fact they exist pushes up the price for everyone else. If you were a spammer and knew that only a small fraction would actually need to be paid it would make sense to do it. And if you were aligned with one or more large miners so that even if they were included you'd get a large part back, then that would be a strong incentive - one which the miners benefit from as well.
I really wonder if some miners started including the mid-low fees instead of highest if we'd see it suddenly collapse. That's probably a sacrifice they wouldn't make but it would be very interesting to see.

Fees are based on tx byte size and demand (block space). If you don't need the tx to confirm quickly (&lt; 1 hour) then you can pay very low fees. For over a month, up til the last few days, fees were very low (pennies) but now it seems either spam, or some other tx generation, is pushing fees up again.
Before sending btc consult one of the many fee estimator sites to check what you could be paying in case your wallet is overpaying.

Electrum is good. Recent versions have good fee estimation and should work. Your problem is that you are just sending too little to have enough for a reasonable fee. Either wait til you have more or try to send for free. Electrum has a "Max" button for calculating the max you can send with fee included. Older versions don't have the button but putting a ! in the amount value will cause it to auto calculate. The recent versions also have a "Preview" button that allows seeing tx details. You can alter how it estimates fees from the Preferences and enable manual overriding.

Your problem is so many inputs. Each input adds bytes to the tx making for a large tx size. Fee is based on size not btc amount. Your size is 4206 bytes or about 53 sat/byte for fee paid. That's a bit low now. Current estimate for that fee is 5 - 100 blocks - so it may take quite a while.
Not sure how you got so many tiny inputs but my guess would be faucet payments. This is the real cost of small payments - when you go to spend them you pay a much higher fee.
edit - You can expedite this tx using CPFP but you would have to pay another 0.0006 btc to get it confirmed quickly. What wallet did you use? You need to use a wallet that allows spending your unconfirmed change output again.

But the official rate is highly restricted and so the black market rate is what any real person has to pay. At least that's been the story I've read in the past. Isn't that rate much higher (like 2-3x) so it would be less satoshi / VEF? 
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:58:48
**The nonce is only part of the input.** 
The input being hashed is the block header and it contains a merkle root which is generated by the txs in the block. Every miner has a different set of txs in a unique order, producing a different merkle root. Also, each miner inserts a different coinbase so that the reward goes to them (their address) so each miner has at very least always one different tx per block.
You are describing a mining pool but even a mining pool hashes the block header partially to produce a midstate which it gives out as work for the individual miners doing the hashes. If you wanted to combine every miner existing into one big mining pool then you forgo the ability for ALL miners to choose tx inclusion and order. ie. You are back to a centralized authority, as I already explained above.
Your main issue is you do not fully understand the mining process. You think you do because you read a little bit about it. You obviously do not - so study more about that and come back when you do.

By "almost same" I meant that the cost of miner hw is predominantly memory chips. So you gain little by making an ASIC that is cheaper than a similarly capable FPGA. As example maybe a $5 ASIC may perform better than a $25 FPGA but the memory that each needs to function may be $1000. Even if you could assign 4x as much memory to that ASIC the effective difference is small. With cuckoo the processing component is much simpler than sha256. One rough estimate I did was that 32 such cores could be instantiated in a XC7A35 FPGA (~$30), or $1 each. Each one requires a set of RAM chips costing much more. Truly you could fit many more such instances in an ASIC but you are limited by both pin count, connection wiring, board layers and also the same number of RAM chips per core must exist. You can manage pin count by multiplexing RAM access but you still need the RAM. You may be able to reduce the core cost from $1 to $0.01. Then you could build custom RAM ASICs with a core built in but can you do that anywhere near the cost of commodity RAM? It has to give you significant gains to be worth designing and producing.

Electrum probably just blocks free txs now to avoid user complaints. You would probably have to do it manually on a site like [coinb.in]( (raw transactions). It's been so long since I've played with this. If you do use that site notice that you may risk exposing the private key. Not that it really matters for such a small amount but for larger amounts it's not advisable. In theory it's safe because the key never leaves the browser but in practice you trust the page and have to be careful about malicious pages / mitm attacks.
I don't know about G2A. Maybe some other wallets don't block free txs.

The fee depends on tx size. So a fee of 0.000562 on a typical tx of 250 bytes is 224 sat/byte - which is very high. But on a tx with many inputs/outputs would be much lower.
If you had selected "replaceable" in Electrum (also called RBF) then you can easily raise the fee from the tx history list with a right click. If not then see below for CPFP method.
Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) - You can bump the tx less easily if you have at least one output under your control, eg. a change output coming back to your wallet. In that case you spend that output again to yourself but include a higher fee. A miner will see this new tx depends on the stuck one and combine fees to confirm them both **if** the total fee for both txs is high enough. If you need a step by step for this just ask.

I prefer using Electrum offline to create a seed word list and then store that safely. There are many methods though. 
A BIP38 encrypted private key printed out is also very good because even a short password takes a lot of resources to crack - so you can go with something you can remember easily.
Once you have a seed or key you can think of various ways to make it fireproof but I think the best is just redundancy. Paper stored in 2-3 locations is better than depending on a single backup even if hammered in steel plate.
I also use the Ledger HW.1 hardware wallet as it's the cheapest at ~$15 (euro actually). It works well enough. I can have both a daily wallet and a multisig long term wallet on the same dongle. But with hardware wallet you still **MUST** save a paper backup of the seed, so it's really just a more convenient way of transacting with a paper wallet. You can get the same result with an Electrum seed created offline and written on paper in several locations. It just takes a few minutes more to access funds.

@_date: 2017-01-05 00:04:37
Good. Ideally you have created the Electrum wallet offline (on a bootable usb stick with no internet connection is fine) and written down the seed. That way it is very close to impossible, even if your offline boot is infected, for the seed to be sent anywhere. But if you are very certain you are not already infected and securely delete the wallet (wipe/shred) then that's an ok second choice.
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:48:49
There are definitely still some gotchas in the system. Some situations need expert knowledge to meet expectations. A good wallet would have estimated the correct fee, even in your situation, for fast confirmation. If for exmaple you use blockchain.info on basic mode it will do poorly. Electrum would have suggested a higher fee.

The problem is that you have no idea what chip and other hardware is inside. It's pretty easy to emulate a known device but not even be the same cpu. In that case it won't matter how you reset it or install firmware as it will all be a simulation and say what it needs to say for you to believe it. 
If cost is a big factor then you're better off with Electrum on a usb boot stick or used laptop as offline wallet, or raspberry pi doing same. All are pretty solid within reason though not as convenient but more trustworthy than random unproven devices.
@_date: 2018-10-27 19:18:23
If you want a technical reason it's because an RBF tx can be altered before confirmation by upping the fee. If done maliciously this could reduce the paid amount. So many merchants (maybe Bitpay too - I didn't check this but seems likely) won't accept RBF until it has 1 or more confirmations. 
Not many wallets give you RBF support anyway but ones like Electrum take the bumped fee increase from the change output (when possible) not the pmt output. The issue is that until confirmed a user could use RBF to change the tx and the one finally confirmed may be different from the one the merchant accepted.
With low fees on the network it probably makes sense to turn it off when paying merchants even though it can be useful under some circumstances when fees are hard to predict reliably.

These memes and shit posts are a fun way of focusing users when the technical details are often too much for many to really feel strongly about. Many people feel rather than think, and this gives them a place in an otherwise technical argument. The fact they often get upvoted so much demonstrates this function.

The design I saw (for Litecoin) still used external regulators for each chip.

I guess I'm unclear on that. I thought you had some tx that needed to be broadcast before a timeout and in the event you became unable it would lead to loss. You must have the tx pre-signed already or you would be trusting the counterparty but you do need to execute it even if already signed. So the failure mode is only when you cannot broadcast it before timeout.

But that was damn stupid. Of course you need to backup up, write down or at very least store the key somewhere before sending significant funds to some random number. 
The keys are not stored anywhere - if they were it would be insecure and someone coming along after you left the room or the site could steal your keys. If the keys depended on the web site url then someone could use the browse history to get your keys. So basically if you can find them anywhere now then it would be a huge security failure.

You're missing that every miner could be (and is) including different txs in their block, in a different order, and therefore every miner has a different merkle root, different time stamps, different coinbase inputs to the hash function. They include the ones that are relayed to them and that varies from miner to miner. If you want to agree on a standard set and order of txs then you are back to having a central authority choosing and potentially censoring txs.

If you use the figure 2.2 (which I don't know if that was final value but I think at one point I read this) for average equivalent block size of 1 MB segwit block, then assume the same total fees (probably a poor assumption) for a block then each tx on average should be 2.2x less.

They are valid when the current block is larger or equal to the locktime value. So when you use the current block on the faster chain it can accept it, but on the slower chain the locktime is in the future by N blocks and is rejected. 
You just want to ensure there is enough time to confirm before any possible catch up. So I guess if the fast one suddenly stopped due to miners mucking about you may get unexpected results like the wrong one confirming.

Go to your history list and right click the stuck tx, choose details. See the output section and if there is one highlighted in yellow then that should be a change output returning to your wallet. Make mental note of that address beginning chars. 
Now go to the address list (Ctrl-A) and click the small triangle on the "Change" address line so it opens a list of addresses. Look for the one noted above. It should be there and may have a balance on the line next to it (not sure, but good confirmation is right one). Now right click and choose "Send From". That will add this address to your Send screen as an input. Go to the Send tab and look for it as input to a new tx. Add a destination address from your address list so this tx will go back to your wallet. Now set the amount to some value less than output amount on the address, and set a fee as below.
To set a good fee you need to know the combined size of the stuck tx and this new one. The next Electrum release will have that info on the tx details info but for now I think you need to work it out another way. You can look up the stuck tx on a block explorer like blocktrail.com (which shows tx size). Since the new tx is only single input and output it will be minimum size of about 225 bytes. Add up the stuck tx size and 225 bytes. Let's say eg. it adds up to 750 bytes - right now you should pay about 90-100 sat/byte to get confirmed fast. So that is 750*100 = 75000 satoshi, or about 0.750 mbtc, or 0.000750 btc. Don't use this figure as the reason your tx was stuck may be that it's much bigger than usual - so use the actual size found by looking it up. 
If you set blocktrail.com as your default explorer in the Electrum preferences then you can right click the tx in history and choose "View on block explorer" to check size quickly. Once you know a suitable fee enter that and click "Preview" on the Send screen. Make sure it all looks good and fee looks right. Click Send. It will cost you the higher fee but once a miner sees you are paying a higher fee they will include the stuck one to get the high new tx fee. It may still take a few blocks to get confirmed because not all miners support this CPFP feature.

It is possible to abuse the system with unconfirmed txs but it's generally not worth bothering for small amounts.
If the purchaser does a double spend that gets broadcast to miners who include the tx before the real tx gets relayed to the same miners, then the store can be accepting it as valid until the new block is found and relayed to the store, at which point it drops the tx it accepted as a double spend. 
To do it without getting detected within seconds is tricky but under certain network conditions or with miner collusion could work.

There's lots of places that accept bitcoin. I've used it for buying domains names, shopping at fasttech.com, renting VPS server space, and buying a few items at other sites. There's plenty more. Maybe have a look at overstock.com. I've never shopped there but I hear they have lots of stuff. 
Maybe you're just not the kind of person that could use internet money? There are physical stores that take it but of course that type of usage is going to be pretty limited for your average person until a lot more people are holding some. 
I've been paid 90% in bitcoin for over 3 years so I always first look for places that take it. Saying it hasn't changed in 4 years is simply to ignore a huge amount of progress that's been made - not in all areas but in some important ones.

It's just a hexadecimal view of the data making up the block. It starts with 01 00 00 00 as version number, 32 bytes of zero is hash of previous block (non-existent),  merkle root, some other fields and then actual tx data.

To brute force the seed would be comparatively slow. BIP39 uses PBKDF2 with 2048 rounds to go from mnemonic+password to xprv and then for each key some EC math. Even on a large GPU array cracking system I think PBKDF2 (x2048) probably would be less than 1 billion tries/second. So the strength of your password is important but not as critical as less hard algorithms. If you used a 9 char simple (a-zA-Z09) password then at 1 billion/sec it would be cracked (on average) roughly in 90 days. But no one would use just 9 chars, right? And hopefully you're going to miss your Trezor before that long.

You must be watching the wrong videos. It's just math programmed in the software. You could change it but since there's thousands of other nodes validating transactions your change wouldn't be accepted by them.
Bitcoins are just numbers in a transaction ledger much like dollars in your bank ledger but controlled instead by a network of thousands of computers following rules - rules defined in the software running on each node, and rules the miners use to update the ledger.

Buying/selling btc isn't a problem but transferring the fiat currency to re-balance that is slow and often costly. Many other reasons too - capital controls, AML delays, risk; you can be sure if it were simple then the prices would be close as people would be doing it. Some markets are fairly easy and have close prices. You can watch bitfinex or bitstamp track China very quickly - both have liquidity. Many others not so much. 
Don't take my word for it - go try to buy cheap and trade the difference.

Segwit and a reduction in tx size (resulting in more tx/block) has almost nothing to do with channels. All you need is a segwit capable wallet to push block capacity forward and many/most wallets already have that ready. Sure, later, having LN will give us potentially huge scaling increases but initially it's going to be segwit capable wallets and people moving btc onto segwit addresses that helps, and which lowers fees for users.

That's not true. There is already an algorithm that makes the advantage of an ASIC minimal. It's [cuckoo ~~hash~~ cycle]( and has Bitcoin implementation [test code]( already. This algorithm would run on an FPGA with almost the same effectiveness as an ASIC and could be mfr'd by small outfits easily. This POW depends on memory latency (not bandwidth) as limit so you gain very little by increasing processing ability.

He's in the hard spot of having to satisfy govt regulators so it's not too surprising that if Bitcoin got more privacy enhancing features over time he may be forced onto less opaque blockchains. But that doesn't mean the rest of us will be - it could be quite an epic battle.

It seems you simply paid too low a fee for the current network conditions. I checked it on blocktrails.com and it says 0.00030157 btc/kB, which is 0.30 mbtc/kB, or  about 29/sat/byte. Right now according to  to get into the next block you would need to pay ~ 100-120 sat/byte, which is fairly typical now.
You can fix this with CPFP using method in this post above. You need a wallet that supports spending from an unconfirmed tx, and you need an output to spend from in the tx. You only have one output to 1EEZc6PFcCU9RDHsj7bG1u5e5DZ1BhjY2E - so if that is not your own address you won't be able to use CPFP. It may eventually confirm at that price or it could be dropped by nodes and never get confirmed. If it gets dropped your btc will show up back in your wallet. So depending on who you sent to and whether you can get back an overpayment you may want to think about sending again, and cleaning up after if it does go through.

I completely discount China volume to the extent that the only component that matters is that reflected via arbitrage in other markets. If China goes up $10 on 5 million volume and only 1000 btc pulls up on Bitstamp or Bitfinex a similar price then I treat that as the net volume.

It's quite a bit of money so if they won't help then you do have a last chance option to try and spend the unconfirmed pmts to yourself with higher fee. You may want to ask bitgo support and explain you have two txs unconfirmed and want to try CPFP to bump them. They should understand that and maybe can suggest a workaround. The sender was either clueless or purposefully trying to scam you by hoping they would be dropped. Doing the CPFP may get you that btc but it does depend on the txs still alive on the miners mempools.

Do you mean BTC-e not BTCC? BTCC is Chinese and at or above other markets, but BTC-e is typically lower because of difficulty in USD deposit/withdrawl. They are based in Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Slovenia? Not sure now.) and shrouded in a mysterious holding company (registered in the UK?) so many people are not confident in taking the risk of sending USD there. That reduces buying pressure. It typically catches up after a while. If you don't mind sending USD to unknown untraceable strangers then you can make some easy money buying on BTC-e and selling elsewhere.

This is all pretty typical for shell company and offshore company registration. There are businesses providing corp registration services in various places that for a small fee will put their names on your company for privacy reasons. The UK and USA both have many businesses that do that. In USA it's big in Nevada and [Wyoming]( You pay a fee and register your company, they put token directors and members on the papers but due to articles structure have no actual control. Many other countries too of course but since the UK/USA banks want the cashflows they target those ones for scrutiny.
Bottom line is you have no idea who runs this exchange and that was the intent. Doesn't mean they're going to get hacked but doesn't mean they won't either. Just that money you sent there could disappear with little recourse. Well, that seems to be about par for all the other exchanges too.

Electrum server admins need to make sure they set the correct chain for their server instead of assuming it works as before. 
But the deeper question is about moving forward trusting in a server implementation being run by someone prioritizing BCH because LN support is already being worked on in Electrum and it won't be relevant to BCH (without segwit). So before long a fork of ElectrumX will be needed to ensure LN support is a priority.

Yes. You need to write the seed words on paper for safety - especially with Tails.
Remote possibility:
If you are using a bootable USB stick there is some remote chance the wallet file is still on the flash stick in unallocated space due to how flash sticks erase data - that is, even writing over may not erase. 
You might try this process just in case. I don't know if tails scrubs the usb space.
1. use dd command to copy raw blocks of entire usb stick to a file on another storage device. eg. with usb stick mounted at /dev/sdc
    dd if=/dev/sdc of=usbimage.bin bs=4M
2. Use a binary search tool to search for the known address string in usbimage.bin. If you locate that by some chance then record it's position. Use dd to copy out a chunk from 64k before to 64k after to a smaller file and open that in a hex editor. I suggest this because opening a huge 4GB image file in a hex editor may not work well. Look for any data that may be the seed value. eg.
    strings -a -t x usbimage.bin | grep -- 1youraddress
If you're lucky this may work.

With iostat I would use something like
    iostat 1 10
That will give an update every second for 10 seconds. That should give you a little snapshot of activity. If the disk is reaching near the limit of USB speeds on pi3 (20-30 MB/s max) then I'd hazard a guess that is the limit rather than CPU. It probably is disk limited from what you said above - high disk i/o low cpu usage.
(If the iowait value is high then it's definitely disk bound)
So even if not cpu then getting the hard disk onto a better system with SATA connection and fast cpu will help greatly. Even fairly old hard disks on SATA can do much better than 30 MB/s but USB 2.0 won't, especially on a pi.

Send From only shows up if the address has an unspent output (balance). It must have a balance if you chose an address from the unconfirmed tx details outputs. Double check address has balance and matches one in tx.

@_date: 2017-01-05 13:45:15
No, because when you combine small inputs into a new tx you can have as little as one output (two is more typical: one for dest, one for change). So like this tx as example - it has 20 or so inputs but only two outputs, one being over 1 btc.

I would also clarify something important (also for any onlookers).
A seed is a word representation of a 128 bit random value used to generate private keys. Anyone having the seed can re-create all your private keys.
A password is used for encrypting the seed value in your wallet. So a password is needed to get access to the seed in the wallet. 
Having a password requires also having the wallet file but having the seed requires nothing else.
Just to be consfusing - there is also an option for a seed password when you create the wallet. This option appends your chosen passphrase on to the seed when it generates the private keys. This is independent of the wallet password above. The purpose of this is to protect your hand written seed word list from attackers. 
It makes having the seed alone not enough to generate the wallet again. 
It also can be used for deniability or a "duress" wallet. You can create one wallet with passphrase X having small token funds, and another wallet with passphrase Y that has substantial funds. When forced to reveal a wallet no one can prove there is more funds on "other" wallets when you reveal passphrase X.

My point is that it would likely only be marginally more efficient because no matter how cheap you made the processing component 90% of the cost and the speed determinant is in the RAM latency. If you tell me that you have looked at the algorithm in detail and don't believe the latency bottleneck is enough then I'd have to reconsider because I know you can grasp that. But if you haven't looked deeply at it then please do before assuming that an ASIC could be multiple times more efficient.

A key file is an option in Keepass that requires having a specific file present in order to gain access. You can put the file on a usb stick and that then means you need both a password and a usb stick to be plugged in for access. Keepass does a hash of the file and if it's not present or the hash is wrong then it doesn't open. It's a simple form of 2FA ( something you know and something you have).

There are two issues here. Exchanges need that info thanks to your government for KYC/AML requirements. Bitcoin sellers on places like localbitcoins.com need it to reduce fraud risk. They are subject to scams involving payment fraud and chargebacks, ie. stolen cards and hacked accounts.
Bitcoin itself has no such requirements. If you want to avoid strenuous ID requirements you'll have to meet in person and deal with cash, or use a payment method that is irreversible like Western Union, money orders etc. Bitcoin is irreversible and that makes it incompatible with forms of payment that can be reversed. Too many have found that out the hard way and once bitten won't deal with possibly fake payments.
I've sold btc many times on localbitcoins without any ID requirements but buying btc is much more burdensome.

Most likely you will need to upgrade your wallet software after the activation because even though most wallets support it they only have it active on testnet. You will need to create a segwit compatible wallet and send funds to that wallet. The segwit addresses will all use 3xxx... addresses, so if an address is 1xxx... then you know it is not segwit compatible. And if it is 3xx... then it could either be multi-sig, or segwit, or both. Once you have funds on a segwit address you should pay less to send from there because the calculation of fees will be different for segwit capable inputs.

Because it only serves to keep the creation rate constant. I don't mean the inflation has no effect - obviously new coins minted has downward pressure. But difficulty going up or down, changing, has little effect. For a two week period there is some variance, the hash rate changes slightly time between new coins. Difficulty may double or halve but the coin creation rate will stay the same. Since the last halving the new supply added is 12.5 btc/block but the difficulty has gone up every two weeks by whatever, 5-10% or so. It could be going down each two weeks and we'd still get 12.5 btc/block. We had difficulty drop in the fall of 2011 for months on end.

Most of the btc came in very few large steps from early 2009 coinbase txs. I'd guess either an early miner personal holdings or an exchange cold storage wallet. An early miner could easily have sold to an exchange and it just became part of their long term storage.

It's only really a problem when you are tracking the txid to update your system as to whether it's been completed. The tx still goes through but if you are a business and your software cannot tell it completed it may be possible to scam a refund or re-send of a withdraw. MtGox infamously claimed their software was using txid as tracking id and so when users requested a re-send it did just that, paying out many times.

I don't have a link off hand but it is explained in some tutorials with a more technical slant. It's not obvious to new users as they tend to think of their wallet like an account with a balance but that is not how Bitcoin works. A wallet is a collection of keys for signing txs, and the blockchain is of blocks containing txs. There are no balances in the blockchain - just txs made by consuming past outputs and creating new outputs. Outputs get combined and re-split as needed.

There will be no ASICs with cuckoo hash because there is almost no benefit to speeding up the processing time, and **memory latency** is already fully optimized due to mass market competition. An ASIC will perform almost identically with an FPGA in this situation and so a very flat playing field exists for miner production. Xilinx, Intel and Samsung probably stand to benefit most but it would be a small part of their overall markets. Every small electronics mfr worldwide can make miners with off the shelf parts.

No worries. I'm not trying to bash you or argue either. Only to clarify why I think you don't have to worry about it.
Thinking about it more I see two situations. (1) where you open the channel and make pmts and can receive pmts where the net balance doesn't exceed your lock. And (2) they open the channel and lock btc so you can receive pmts.
In (1) if your system crashes you don't need the LN to do anything to be safe. Either they close the channel and get what they expect (your balance settles to your address), or they let it expire and you get all the locked funds (which is worse for them so they should not let it expire). You're all good.
In (2) you do need some way to make the close tx (they signed for you) safe and redundant. Not sure what the plan is here. Maybe your wallet will keep a backup of the close tx hosted online (electrum server?). I guess it will depend on how the wallet works. But I do see a worst case here that you cannot send the close tx and some entity needs to do that (not the node because they have incentive not to).
Or I may be unaware of some bi-directional channel trick they have already figured out. I know they have moved way beyond where I am in understanding the details.

The recover should work regardless of anything like that because it is creating a new wallet with no connection with the old one. In theory, they cannot even know about it because the seed should never leave the browser and never be sent to the server. So it should not be possible for them to alter or prevent recovering the wallet. If it creates a wallet with different addresses then the only possible reason left is an incorrect word or different word list - that should only depend on the math involved, not their server.
@_date: 2016-11-04 01:48:08
Coinbase uses a shared wallet and only shows your balance in your account page - they hold them for you. If you want your btc in your own address then you need to create a wallet with software like Electrum (or Mycelium or others) and then withdraw btc from Coinbase to that wallet. Then you have full control but also must take proper security precautions to keep them safe.

Likely no difference. You'll see a change when blocks start to fill up again and the pressure is on. But this time you'll have another tool in your chest - you can create a segwit compatible wallet and send your funds there. Now your txs fees will be discounted according to segwit rules. You can do that right away too, though I think I'd wait for a bit of feedback from users on the cutting edge just in case.
Segwit addresses will be 3xxx like multisig (P2SH) so as you see more of those around you'll know it's taking hold. You can't tell an address is segwit or multisig by looking at it, and only when you spend from one will you see a discount (I think that's right, unless I got mixed up).
@_date: 2016-11-22 07:02:24
That wasn't my understanding of CPFP - from what I read the miner will base the priority on the size of the tx plus the size of the unconfirmed tx it tries to spend.
@_date: 2016-11-18 02:05:52
Yes. It puts used addresses in a "hidden" list and shows you the next upcoming unused addresses. Ctrl-A in Electrum will give you the address tab where you can view unused/used regular/change addresses. It always gives you the next unused one as your suggested receive address but any of the ones in the unused list can be used. Most wallets do this now.
In fact you can use the console to have Electrum generate 1000 new addresses if desired (no point generally). 
You will probably ask about "change" addresses next: 
When you create a tx you take some UTXOs (unspent outputs) and combine them as inputs to the new tx resulting in 1 or more new outputs (to the address(es) you intend to pay). But outputs cannot be partially used up like a dollar bill cannot be partly spent or a check partly cashed. So when the total of inputs is summed it typically exceeds the amount being paid to your destination address. That extra amount that needs to be used and is sent back to an address in your wallet as "change". Electrum keeps a secondary list of change addresses and you'll notice as you spend btc some of it ends up on those addresses instead of your regular ones. 
Also note that the difference between inputs summed up and outputs summed up is a small amount left hanging - that is the fee taken by the miner. It has no address but the miner is allowed to "sweep" it into their "coinbase" (mining reward) tx.

You must be mining for a pool. In that case what you are doing is hashing data the pool supply's (called work) to fill in some missing bytes that make the work match a target value. If you get the bytes that satisfy the condition then they get sent back to the pool and the pool inserts it in a new block that is relayed to the network. 
If the block is accepted by the network then (after 100 blocks) the reward and fees are received by the pool. Usually they add your share of the reward to your pool account before that because who wants to wait so long.
"Hashing" is a complex one-way math operation on data.

You are apparently trying to trick noob users into exposing private keys. There is really nothing fascinating about this anyway. It's just numbers, sequential numbers, random numbers, whatever. If you really want a search bar you should limit it to 5-6 first chars and then calculate pages from that subset. Without a user typing in a private key you are very unlikely to ever show an address with a balance, or any txs,  - hence, it's entirely pointless. Without the search it would be a bit of a joke but with that it becomes dangerous for noobs who may not know better.

If Multibit HD is BIP39 compatible then you can import the seed into Electrum. In theory, but I haven't done it myself.
Choose File, New/Restore. Then Standard wallet, I already have a seed. Then paste the word list in and click options. Select BIP39 and if you used a BIP39 passphrase then choose the other option about extra data. Continue on. Choose defaults. Set a new password for this wallet. It should generate the same addresses as in MultiBit.
If that doesn't work then use the tool at  (preferably copy offline if substantial funds) to explore and check the seed list and addresses. Maybe the derivation or xpub values are being used differently in MultiBitHD. That tools lets you dig into the key chains and get actual keys which can be imported.

I don't think that's true. Actually OB could make the ability to safely manage channels when users aren't online part of their services. I saw them being a privileged node with regard to LN &lt;&gt; OB interaction and taking fees but perhaps their eventual plan is some structure that allows them a more exclusive cut, kind of like how PP and eBay arose. 
I see LN as a potentially more flexible and private for OB users and if they're not willing to support it eventually the market will provide.

No. Other than your interest cost and risk of exchange hack/exit (which IMO are significant) you have locked profit at price you short at but forgo any further upside. The main advantage is not creating a taxable event yet, and only will if required by future events.
As the price rises your gain from holding btc is offset by loss from shorting. As price drops your loss from holding btc is offset by gain in shorting. As a strategy it may not fit all purposes but it's worth considering when tax is high (short term gains) to defer an event, and if the market is volatile but you want stability. But as mentioned the main risk is exchange counterparty - how much can you really trust some of these exchanges.

If the problem is tx malleability shouldn't it be feasible for early versions of LN to work in coordination with a sympathetic mining pool (Slush?) to directly inject txs ensuring no alteration? It would be slower for settlement but seems like a start to bootstrapping LN and as the network uses LN more it becomes an incentive to pass SegWit so other miners can share the revenue of those txs. Just an idea.

I didn't look at GPU architecture at all. When I first read the white paper (not that long ago) I immediately started thinking about FPGA implementation. I have an Arty7 FPGA dev board here and wanted to code up a Verilog test. My initial thought was using a RISC-V core I have already ([picorev32]( and that ~25 cores can fit on the Arty. The Arty only has 256MB of DDR3 so I would have to code a smaller version initially but my idea was that eventually I would lay out a board with the XC7A35T and enough memory chips to utilize maybe 16 cores (so 12 GB DDR). Something like that anyway. I think groups of 4 siphash/cuckoo cores could bus to a RAM bank (3x4x256MB)(48x256MB DDR3L chips total). Anyway, this is a rough initial sketch. I have not had time to dig into this more. The picorv32 has a gcc compiler and if the reference code can be fit in ~4k then it can be placed inside each core as BRAM. I'd need to spend a lot more time to work it out.

There is no reward for nodes to spread (other than the personal security/privacy reward of running your own node).
With pruning it's not a problem to run a node on a low end device even with low disk space. A raspberry pi can run a node and that's roughly comparable to phones but cheaper. They can take a long time to sync but some people sync on a fast desktop and then copy the full sync data to the rasp pi after for ongoing low power use. A pruning node can run with only a few GB of disk space.

Miners are always working on different blocks because there is never any canonical ordering of txs. They can arrive at different times for each miner and so will be ordered differently - hence, different blocks. But it doesn't matter (efficiency wise) because which ever ones get "found" first will get relayed and either accepted or not. When nodes get a block and accept it they remove all it's txs from the mempool leaving those not included to be in the next block. Same with miners, they remove those txs from the block they are mining.
@_date: 2016-11-07 14:26:45
As long as you haven't lost the private key you swept (and it hasn't fallen into someone else's hands) then you haven't lost your btc. 
You can try sweeping the key again into another wallet. I'd suggest Electrum as it's easy and lets you set the fee. If doing it again gives an error then likely the tx is still in the mempool and won't go yet. 
There is a second option. If the tx shows as unconfirmed in your wallet then you can send another tx using the unconfirmed balance. Not all wallets allow this but you can try. You send using the unconfirmed balance to another address in your wallet and include a double fee - enough to cover the last tx and this new one. This is called CPFP (Child Pays For Parent), and some miners support this feature and will mine both txs by treating the fee as covering both. Since not all miners do this it may take a while still until a CPFP enabled miner includes it.
edit: note an adequate fee depends on the tx size, not the btc amount. The tx size mostly depends on the input/output count. Good wallets now will suggest an adequate fee but not all are so good. So be sure to check the fee. If you need help deciding on a fee and don't need privacy you can post the stuck txid here and we'll have a look and suggest what fee to use.

Any trade that involves different markets where there is a price difference. The result of the trade is to narrow the price difference. This is exactly how exchanges like Bitfinex or Bitstamp follow OKCoin or Huobi or vice versa. 
Buying low selling high causes the high price to drop and the low price to rise re-balancing the difference (if continued to it's limit). It's generally considered to be a low risk trading strategy but of course that depends - in Bitcoin it may not be as low risk as it seems due to a history of exchange failures.

Bitcoin's blockchain is currently about 100GB and increasing at about 144 MB/day (1MB block size limit). Larger blocks would increase this rate and increase node cost - probably forcing some nodes to shut down. Core devs have been working for a few years on various ways to make the network more efficient and add 2nd layer protocols on top of Bitcoin to leverage the limited storage space. This seems to me like a better approach then just making bigger blocks. But it is a huge ongoing source of debate within the community.

I think it would depend on how full blocks are. If nearly full it takes less txs to create a backlog that causes users to increase fees.

There is no fee value recorded in btc txs and they have not calculated and added it in the json output. So you would have to do it yourself. Add up all the input and outputs values. Subtract total output value from total input value. That is the fee.
To detect if spent or recd you check the addresses. If address is an input then it's being spent and fee is relevant. If address is an output then it's being recd and fee was paid by other sender. If address is both input and output then presumably is same wallet tx and fee may or may not be what you want to track.
edit: looking again at json data I notice you only get scripts for recd pmts. Those fees are paid by sender so no worries. You only need to sum and subtract ones where you spend from the address and those have the details.

Your seed acts as a generator for a chain of private keys that make up your wallet. An address is generated from the private key and used for receiving btc.
You don't generally need to work with the private key as the wallet will take care of that. It will use the private key to sign transactions it sends on the network. It doesn't store the private keys as it can always generate them as needed for any address in the wallet.
When you use an address to receive btc the wallet will always generate a new address for future use because addresses generally should not be re-used. They can be re-used but doing that reduces privacy.
As long as you back up your seed you don't need to save and backup private keys. They can always be generated from the seed using math (by the wallet software).
The btc you own are technically "Unspent Transaction Outputs" (UTXOs) that exist in the blockchain distributed across the nodes of the network. A private key is required to sign a new tx using UTXOs as inputs to create a new output to the address you spend to. So there is no "balance" as such - just a collection of outputs on your addresses signable by your keys. Your wallet tracks these UTXOs and adds them up to give you a balance.
Save and protect your seed. That is the critical part. Anyone who gets that can steal your btc.

There ought to be a white list of Coinbase friendly exchanges. Places where you can send your coins and know that it's now out of Coinbase's AML/KYC purview. I'd suggest sending to Bitfinex, BitStamp or a few others (there are so many non-US ones) and then withdrawing to different wallets. But I don't know if that is effective or even just going to raise an alarm. I'm not aware of any solid research on this.
The thing about exchanges is that, AFAIK, they all use shared wallets. So btc coming in is disjoint from btc going out and there is a sizable pool (swamp?) in between.

In Canada you might also look into quickbt.com and flexepin. You buy a flexepin at a local convenience store and then enter the code on their web site to send btc to your address. It requires a phone # because they send an sms message to confirm. Not sure what the exchange rate they use is but like an ATM the flexepin has a fee.

Well, if it doesn't confirm then it gets dropped and the btc will end up back in your wallet. If it does confirm, which it should eventually (at 21sat/byte, as long as the mempool doesn't get hit again soon), then it will end up where you sent it. You won't lose the btc into a void.
The only other option is trying a double-spend on it. That's possible with Electrum but a bit of a hack (you have to make a few wallet file edits and then create a new tx before connecting to the server again). I've played with this a couple times and was able to make the new tx but never able to get it to be accepted by the network. If you see your tx id no longer valid on blockchain.info then it may be possible to save some time doing the double spend rather than waiting for miners to also drop the old one. Odds are you will just need to wait. The default drop time for nodes is 72 hours.

Yes, that is correct. I was looking as well and found the same page. As long as the green certificate (padlock) in the url bar has correct ID info (can click to check) it should be good. This recover should work for you but note it will create a new wallet with new user id code and I presume you'll have to add an email address and set options like 2FA etc. again. The seed words can generate the new wallet but cannot restore any options or details like descriptive titles, notes. It should allow you to access the wallet and send btc. 
edit: I just tested it with my own test wallet and it did ask for email and password for a new wallet. It did give me the same address list matching my test Electrum wallet too. But again if it doesn't have your history then that would inidcate your word list is wrong. (It must be in correct order).

The block size does not affect how fast they solve a block. Once the block is built the hashing takes the same time regardless of size. Miners usually incrementally extend the block as new txs are added.
It does affect how quickly new blocks gets relayed across the network. A larger block may take a few seconds longer and in that time another miner may find a block and be relayed quicker beating out the larger one. It's currently not such a big difference that miners cut back (unless maybe they have a poor connection).

Depositing more won't help. It has to be an output from the stuck tx for this to work. It's not enough to be from the same address - it has to be the output indicated in the tx details screen. If you did this once already and it is also stuck, then use the output from the child tx again.

In that case use Electrum offline signing. It gets very close to hardware level but only needs a USB stick. It's slightly less convenient (2-3 minutes to reboot and sign tx) but nearly free. It's far better than a paper wallet as you can reliably make transactions and it's more flexible. Of course, you still write down and safely store the seed words just like a hardware wallet.

It was announced hours before they became illegal tender. And banks will exchange for new bills (up to a per time limit) or for deposit (which obviously is reported for tax investigation). 
Problem was the new bills had not been printed in adequate supply so were hard to get even by banks, new bills were a new size and didn't fit ATMs, so they were backlogged, and people have to exchange old bills within a period of a few weeks. And the withdrawn bills were a huge part of the entire Indian domestic economy - hundreds billions of dollars equivalent.
Then, consider any rich person would have long ago converted to something more solid like gold or USD. So mostly it was middle to poor people savings being hit along with black money. And people quickly figured out convoluted ways to game the system like exchanging bills for others at a discount (apparently 10-20% fee). Some paid others to wait in line all day and exchange bills for them. And retails stores pretty much closed because no one had cash to spend.

Electrum will restore a seed from hex data value. So you can generate a 32 digit hex value using 4 coins very easily, totally offline. Use 4 coins because then they form 4 binary bits which is easy to add in your head and type in as hex. That's truly random with no hardware to worry about being compromised.
For those who don't know how easy 4 bits as hex in your head is just add coins as powers of 2. eg. flip 4 coins on table in front of you, left to right
    Heads Heads Tails Heads
add tails as 0, heads as 1+2+0+8 = 11 but above 9 use ABC... so 11 is B. Enter that. Repeat 31 more times. Done. Random seed.

Not sure what you did - no details, but a $0.15-0.20 fee is usually enough to get a typical tx in the next block.
Are you using a recent 2.7+ version of Electrum? Older versions may not calculate fee as well given market changes over the last half year.
Another thing that can really mess up fees is if you received a lot of very small txs in your wallet. That can bloat the tx size when spending, leading to higher fees.
See 
If you have a change output coming back to your wallet from the tx then it is possible to bump the tx and get it confirmed quickly.

Changing the time to cover the recent surge:
What I find interesting here is that further down the page we see graphs of fees/tx and fees/byte. During the surge we see fees/tx increase greatly but the fees/byte only a little. That would seem to suggest that during these times some txs get larger, consuming more space, but pay the same fee/byte on average. If that's the case then the tx/sec accepted would barely change and discovery of attack would have to be by analyzing how/why the size changes during these periods.

As long as you have your seed words safely written down then whatever you do with the wallet, even delete it, can be recovered from. You can enable encryption without problems. It will only protect you if your system isn't already compromised, and it won't help if you get malware with a key logger. To be safe against malware you need an offline wallet - that is one you create on a system never connected to the internet. You can do that with Electrum or you can use a hardware wallet. eg. Trezor, Ledger, Keepkey. Ledger has the HW.1 which is the cheapest at only about $15. When you start to have more btc then you feel safe with on your desktop then you should research these options.

Brief outline:
Keep only an HD master PUBLIC key (xpub, like generated from Electrum) on your server.
Generate an address from that for each user sale/invoice. Store it in db linked to user and invoice id. (Use pmt requests BIP70 if you want better user security)
Present address to user for invoice.
Monitor new blocks for addresses in your db. Add a pmt record when you see a tx match. Record block  
After each new block check db, pull pmts N blocks behind current as confirmed and update invoice status and processing.
Most of this is pretty easy but it gets much more complex if you need to handle outgoing pmts/refunds online. For most small businesses you can probably handle any refunds offline, or at least not on a public facing server, using wallet software (like Electrum). You can automate it to some extent by having the system generate a refund tx that is sent by email (or how you like) to admin for offline auditing/signing.
I use Electrum as an example because all the code for this in Python is open source but also they have a daemon mode that you can interact with in any server scripting - offloading all the crypto/wallet stuff to the daemon. You can also build it on top a full node if preferable.
edit: I missed it above but when new blocks arrive you also need to handle re-orgs (if you do this yourself). This means tracing prev-block hashes back to a known good one and reversing any dropped pmts from orphaned blocks, before re-adding on the valid chain.

Child Pays For Parent - miners optionally can now (as of 0.13.0) choose to mine a tx based on the fee covering any unconfirmed parents of the tx. So if you spend an unconfirmed tx output in a new tx and pay a fee that is enough for both txs it has higher chance of being mined.

When you restore a BIP39 seed in Electrum you can specify an account number before it generates the wallet. Each account number will represent an entire sub-tree of keys for the same seed. However, Electrum doesn't normally create a BIP39 wallet by default so you have to use some alternate method to get the initial BIP39 seed. eg. hardware wallet, Mycelium, some utility etc. BIP39 also allows for a passphrase as extra seed word and Electrum supports that besides account number. You have to check a box in the options when restoring a seed.

Presumably once Electrum supports LN you will have control of that. It's just payment channels extended as a relay network. You seem to be doubting me. Let me explain in a simplified example and maybe a lightbulb moment will occur. Keep in mind it can be more than this and your wallet would make this opaque, ie. it just looks like a pmt to you.
1. To open a channel with a LN node you time lock some amount to an address you control - that could be in electrum, on paper, wherever. Once the lock expires the btc are usable from your address.
2. You want to pay someone via LN. You sign a tx paying your btc to their address and pass it to the LN node. If that tx is broadcast the pmt occurs and change goes to you BUT the node doesn't broadcast it. It holds it simply as a state of the channel and it waits. It can broadcast any time before the lock expires and still get it's pmt.
3. You can send more pmts as above by sending a new tx with revised total amount paid - again only held by the LN node for now.
4. Finally one of two things happens. (i) The node decides to close the channel by broadcasting the last tx getting it's channel total pmt, change returned to you or (ii) the time lock expires and all funds are available on your address.
Keep in mind you are the one creating and signing the txs here. So you can make sure nothing funky happens. The node also checks the txs it holds open and doesn't treat it as paid if it sees a funky tx. 
Now extend this scheme. The LN node has many channels open with users and is tracking their states (stored txs) and some of those are to other LN nodes. As long as a path can be found between you, the nodes, to a final pmt receiver you can pay that receiver. 
Net on-chain txs are (1) lock funds (open) channel and (2) close channel. But in between may be a thousand temporary hold txs never broadcast by the node - all potentially could have closed but didn't. It is also possible to extend the channel in time or add more funds.
I'm not a LN dev so I'm sure there is more finesse in the details but this is the basic idea. They are working on routing protocols and even onion routing so that nodes don't know final dests or srcs. It's pretty amazing.

The first tx in each block is called a "Coinbase" tx. It is allowed to create the reward out of nothing paying whatever addresses the miner sets. The fees come from the difference between each tx inputs less outputs. The consensus rules for each node verifying blocks on the network allow this to occur. Anything different would be rejected as invalid.

Probably not but it helps. If you have something go wrong it may be hard to figure out what and why without some knowledge. It's also kind of easy to get into trouble without some understanding.

Probably not much. These super computers are generally not very efficient at hashing compared to even small "cheap" miners. There is no easy conversion between petaflops and GH/s but it usually isn't exceptional - and outright poor when including power and cost.
One estimate I googled suggested 50 petaflops ~ 10500 GH/s &lt; Antminer S9. If that's even in the ball park then this machine would be like 3 Antminers costing $7000 total. Not the best use of funds to mine with this behemoth.

In most cases you cannot re-broadcast. If it's still in the mempool of the node you broadcast on it will be rejected. Trying a push tx page on a block explorer site may work but in cases I've tried it was always rejected.
You can try using CPFP but it depends on being able to spend some part of the original outputs (eg. change, or received output). That can work as long as miners supporting CPFP haven't dropped it.
@_date: 2016-11-21 12:01:32
When you open the channel you are sending funds to another address you own. So if your system crashes you at least know at time X your funds move to there.
At some later time you sign a tx where part goes to them and change goes to your address. Again if your system crashes you may lose state knowledge but they have incentive to close with your last tx. If they let it expire you won't lose anything.
In the case of bidirectional pmts, which I'm a bit unsure having not thought about it, I think it's the same. You would sign a tx where the paid amount is lower (deducted rather than raised), but again they close the channel even if you crash.
However, the node (pmt hub) needs to be pretty damn robust to not lose out. I guess they would need redundancy to ensure they don't let channels expire if their system crashes. At least thats my thoughts on it but I'm not expert on the inner workings.

Thank you for your input. I take it this is temporary then.
If I understand correctly then after a next firmware release we will be able to use the Nano/HW.1 with the mobile app without forced re-init or periodic key card validation? If so, then very good. 
I would hope you have gone one step further and removed or disabled the keyboard text output (basic mode) as well, ie. only support mobile app validation in future. You are likely already be aware but I believe there is a way to compromise that mode that works on initial insertion without any user interaction (not sending a tx). If not then I can disclose it directly to you as I do not want it to be public. As it stands the dongle can be set to key card/secure screen mode disabling basic mode anyway (which is what I've done).  
I was working on Electrum mobile auth because I believe it is the only secure choice after spending a couple days investigating how the dongle actually works (something one cannot do from reading the online info). I'd also like to later upgrade it to not require a third party websocket server but for now that is still the best choice. Later on the basic text and key card modes should be removed as well.

You could give those addresses out but generally that's not how they're used. The addresses in Receiving section are meant for that. Technically they are all just addresses but change ones are meant for internal use much like "change" when you spend a $10 bill and get $1.34 back when the amount due was $8.66.
Bitcoin tx inputs are made up of outputs from previous txs and they cannot be partially spent - so often the total tx spend is more than the amount due and some must be returned as change to your own wallet.
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:50:52
Yes. But address space is more like 2^160 due to ripemd160 hash being used. There is one public key for each private key but then that is hashed by ripemd constraining it's output to 160 bits.
@_date: 2016-12-03 00:19:13
You can use CPFP to expedite the tx. It doesn't depend on a wallet option as it's something done by the miners. I looked at your tx id and you have two outputs. One is to 15taVS... for a small amount which is presumably the change output (back to your wallet). You need to spend that unconfirmed output to "anywhere", but typically to your self. 
Your wallet needs to allow spending an unconfirmed output - some don't or they have it as an option to enable. Also, phone wallets don't usually allow choosing outputs to spend so the only easy way is to spend the entire balance (less fee) to yourself.
You need to include a tx fee suitable for both the new tx size and the stuck tx size. Your stuck tx was 373 bytes so you should add about 0.3 mbtc to the fee. I'd suggest just doubling it to 0.6 mbtc fee.
The idea here is this: you spend this unconfirmed output with a high fee and miners see it and recognize that it depends on the stuck one. To gain the high fee they also need to include the stuck one with low fee. Not all miners do this but in my few times helping people do this it usually gets confirmed pretty quickly - within a few blocks.

Value (price) is not based on cost of mining but market driven supply/demand.
But nonetheless QC will require changes to mining algorithms (and all of bitcoin really) if it ever gets far enough to matter. Bitcoin doesn't use encryption at all but it does use hashing (sha256, ripemd) and signatures (ECDSA). It's a technical point but people shouldn't be thinking data is encrypted in Bitcoin - it is entirely in the clear and transparent.

You mean do the EC math to generate a public key and address from a private key? That is the only step you could speed up with an ASIC as private keys can just be enumerated by a counter.
The process of private key brute forcing is one of comparing generated addresses against an in-memory list of UTXOs. So you could add DRAM to an ASIC and pipeline the lookup process. I'm not sure you would gain that much but I haven't done any timing estimates. Maybe less than an order of magnitude over CPU/RAM based lookups. Obviously the UTXOs should be in a tree to make comparisons fast and that's probably almost as fast with a CPU.
I have a good sized FPGA free that I could apply to this but have never even thought about working on the VHDL (though I could). Never thought it worthwhile.
**edit:** On second thought there is quite a bit of fast SRAM in the FPGA and that could hold a reduced UTXO table of medium-high value address prefixs. Each FPGA is about $25 and can probably parallel several conversions. So an array of these would be cheaper than CPU farms.
This FPGA can run at 400 MHz and maybe a conversion could be done in one cycle. Maybe, but I haven't thought it out. So a $25 chip could maybe do 400 million lookups/sec. If you wanted to throw $25,000 at it (I don't) I suppose you may be able to check 400 billion addresses/sec. 
2^160 / 3000000 utxos / 400x10^9 / s = 1.21 x 10^48 s = 3.86 x 10^40 years.
To answer your question: it doesn't seem like an attractive use of money to develop an ASIC for this purpose.

Nowadays there is a minimum fee for using the network. It used to be easy to send for free but now you'll find free txs don't get confirmed. You need to have about 10 satoshis/byte now at least. For a typical 250 byte tx that would be around 2500 satoshi or 0.000025 btc.
See  for recent fees. If you're willing to wait more than a few hours right now then you may get a free tx confirmed when the network isn't busy.

A light weight client, if you mean by that a wallet like Electrum, doesn't blindly go along with miners - it blindly goes along with whatever server it's using, which would be running on a full node. Any economic activity will be on the network the server uses. 
So as a light client user, not running your own full node, it's vital you should check and select what server you use according to what node software they use and network they run on, when any split occurs. Right now you have to kind of use detective work to figure it out. I think it should be more obvious a choice in Electrum.

The only way I know of to get micro-payment low fees is going to be with Lightning Network. Fees should approach near zero as txs are simply bits of signed code and there is no overhead of storing globally every tx every human/machine makes. 
This is why LN is considered such a big thing by most technically savvy devs. Basically you get the efficiency of storing txs in sql databases but close to full security of on-chain txs. It will get exciting when exchanges figure out how to do trading on LN because it will mean user funds (except fiat) are not at risk of exchange failure, exit scams, seizure. Dark markets should be more reliable.

So being able to simply use rpc to signal that I've processed block N and don't need it would be nice. I just saw the PR yesterday and thought, oh cool someone did that.

I don't think you need to although I haven't gone to read specific T&amp;C, and whether they allow foreign accounts (though you could probably bypass that). In theory you open an account and send btc to the account and sell at the premium price. Just hold a rupee balance for now. Then when the price has retreated or become balanced with other exchanges you buy back your btc and withdraw them. Of course, there is risk holding rupee but you would have that if you could open a bank account too, and risk the premium gets higher. The premium offers a form of short selling - it naturally corrects the over pricing.

But on any of the major exchanges you'll find much lower than that. eg. just checked Kraken (since you are using Euro) and atm their spread is about 0.40 EU.

Miners will charge fees as they do now dependent on tx size and block capacity. 
The pmt fees made on LN do not go to miners but open/close tx on the channel do as they are just normal txs. So you could do a thousand very small txs on a channel and close/finalize the channel with a single mined tx. 
The point is if you are sending ~$100 to a friend/business you probably would do it as you do now. But if you are sending 10,000 x $0.001 txs for GBs downloaded from various services over a month, then you would pay by LN and only pay for 2 txs mined to open/close the channel, and maybe some small channel use fee. It wouldn't even be worth doing those small txs on the blockchain due to fee costs and delays. And we wouldn't want to store 10,000 txs per user per month forever  on the blockchain anyway no matter how super huge the blocks could get.

This has no bearing on cold wallets. I think you're missing nearly everything about how this works. It's certainly not correct - you don't need to make big txs and miner fees may go up or down, depending on LN uptake, but they will certainly leverage a far higher volume of much smaller value txs on LN - the type that are not going to be feasible on the blockchain anyway.
If you are sending a single large amount you will likely still do it on the blockchain. But if you are doing thousands of very small amounts, like paying by page read, or MB downloaded, or minutes used, then you likely would use LN. I think where the line falls between which method is something to be seen depending on how LN develops, how many LN node operators there are, and how competitive it gets. 
It could well be that many full nodes now may run LN software as well and commit btc to channels between nodes, in order to make fees. In that case being highly competitive fees should be very low.
LN is a network of channels. So the idea is you can commit btc, according to your expected usage over some period, to one node and by the connections between nodes, be able to pay anyone else in the network by node relaying.
@_date: 2016-12-20 07:51:26
That's a very low fee so it's not surprising. Fee doesn't depend on amount sent but rather on tx size in bytes. If your tx used up many inputs it would be larger than one using only 1 input.

That sounds like a very suspect design choice given that it's the Security Card that offers poor security and the phone app that is actually more secure because it uses an encrypted channel for validation. The security card should be disabled and destroyed but we have no choice on a closed source dongle.
Is this purely a play to force people to upgrade to the most costly solutions?
I have an HW.1 which I bought under the misguided belief it was actually a secure hardware wallet option. In fact both the low end validation options are poor and the phone option is the only one that approaches the security of their other expensive choices (which I'm sure they'd rather you buy).
I have just been working on updating the Electrum Ledger plugin to add a better user interface and to **support the mobile app validation** because that is the only half decent security option for an HW.1 or Nano. It's not finished yet but I do have it pairing and validating txs and just need to tidy it up and it needs more testing. I'll be very pissed off if they are forcing users to use the lousy security card method instead of the phone app.
The security card is a **terrible method** that is not safe against targeted malware on any device. It is known already that malware only needs to collect about 10 pin entries to build a table that allows faking a tx validation. But that can also be reduced through some other techniques and user laziness to a high probability of success in only 0-2 pin entries.
If what you say is true then I'd consider Nano/HW.1 products to be severely compromised by any targeted malware, but I'd also never trust in the company again and certainly wouldn't consider future products. I always considered the non-open source of the dongles to be a real problem as you are locked into their design choices.
I think it's long overdue a cheap solution like the [U2F Zero]( be created for a low end hardware dongle that is truly open source. The claim of a closed source secure element being better is now demonstrably wrong. I have a preliminary stage design based on the U2F Zero that would cost only $3 to build using an Atmel secure element and SAM D21 Arm core. It could do U2F as well as being user upgradeable with new applications or adding altcoins. It was a back burner project as I thought the HW.1 was cheap enough. But not if the phone app is a degraded option. **That really, really pisses me off.**
One should also note the phone app depends on ledgerwallet.com for a websocket channel. Having been through the source in detail now I see it also uses Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) and pushes pairing ids up to the ledger web site for wake up via GCM. They can track all validations using this method but should not be able to view details or intercept txs. But it is a dependency. An open source solution for a dongle could use a local p2p method like bluetooth or local discovery so that validations are not sent across the internet and susceptible to both traffic analysis and DOS.

When your unconfirmed txs get finally dropped, the btc you sent will show up again in your wallet. You cannot lose btc by sending if the send is dropped/canceled. They don't go into a black hole somewhere.

No, unless you can find a way to privately give a miner the tx. eg. if the pool or miner had a push tx form on their site that only included it in their block. With some co-ordination it may be possible to distribute to segwit miners only. It kind of defeats the intent of the network though and no one would see the tx as unconfirmed - it would only be visible after confirmation.

The only option is if you own the 1LSH... address. If so, you can spend that output with a fee high enough to pay for both stuck and new tx.

This tool let's you explore and view keys on BIP39 chains:
It can be copied offline to be sure your seed and keys are safe. 
I think on this tool you should select BIP32 tab and use derivation m/0'/0 with "hardened addresses" not selected. It should give the same address list. Even if the seed cannot be imported into Electrum then the relevant private keys can be imported into a non-HD Electrum wallet (choose standard wallet, I have private keys) that will allow sending a tx.
Also, this is true for the xprv. You may be able to restore a wallet in Electrum using an xprv even if seeds are not-compatible. This tool above can let you check and fnd the xprv that matches your address list and then import that.
Note - never enter an xprv or seed into an online block explorer.

Each new block includes hashes that can be considered random since no ones knows who will find it first. So you can use the block id or other tx ids as random numbers and base lottery on matching some part of that. eg. first 8 digits of block id on block N is winning ticket. Or build something more complicated if needed because simple method like above may not be adequate. Depends what you want to do.

I personally would use a wallet that let me adjust the fee but it did seem to choose an appropriate value. I haven't used it but breadwallet has a good reputation.
Generally if the fee is lower than the bulk of txs waiting then it can take many hours. If it doesn't get confirmed after 72 hours (default, but changeable on each node) then it gets dropped and the btc will eventually show up again in your wallet.
If you wanted to expedite it there are basically two choices. First and easiest is to use a wallet that supports RBF (Replace By fee). That requires setting the option before sending and it allows increasing the fee after sent if you find it's got stuck. Electrum has that feature but I don't know which others. 
Second is using a feature that some miners support called CPFP (Child Pays For Parent). This is done by sending a second tx that uses one output from your stuck one and pays an extra high fee to cover the byte size of both. For this you need an output in your wallet from the stuck tx. That means either you're receiving the pmt or you have change coming back from a sent payment. It also requires a wallet that allows spending an unconfirmed unspent output. Many phone and simpler wallets don't allow that but again Electrum does and is probably the most versatile wallet available for many other features it supports (though not the Android version which has a simpler limited interface).

There's probably a way to get a nice compact tcpdump. Many options but I haven't played around with it much. If you did a watch cmd on netstat -ntp you would get something with active tcp connections. Probably a way to filter by port.
    watch -n 1 netstat -ntp
    watch -n 1 "netstat -ntp |grep 8333"
A mempool visualizer would be kind of cool. I haven't heard of one before but it wouldn't be too hard as you can attach notify calls using config options. Mostly it would be figuring out a nice visual layout that's time consuming. I could see maybe small blocks, based on btc amount, tetris style floating down to layer across the bottom. And when a block is formed some portion get zapped in a poof and swept into a block stack on the side, with summary info, pushing down the stack. Or something like that maybe - everyone probably has their own ideas.

It's not you. Whoever sent you the btc decided on the fee.
You can use Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) to bump the fee. That will get it confirmed faster than waiting around. To do this you send some btc to yourself using btc from the incoming tx. Maybe a bit tricky without a better understanding of how txs work. It requires a wallet that allows choosing tx inputs like Electrum, and paying a double fee to cover the new tx and offset the low original fee.

No. You will need info from your existing wallet to manually create a tx there. Here's a rough tutorial. Normally Electrum does all this for you so this is simply for educational purposes.
A transaction takes 1 or more outputs from previous transactions and combines them to form 1 or more new outputs. So you will need to look at the addresses in your wallet that still have a "balance", ie. unspent output. Hopefully not too many or else this gets time consuming.
On the coinb.in raw tx page you will want to copy/paste the address (or WIF private key (5xxx...)) and click the "load" button. It will add unspent outputs for that address/key into the inputs tab of the tx. You can get the WIF private key by right clicking in the Electrum address list for any address still having a balance. It's also possible to manually enter each input but more time consuming and it needs the key for signing anyway so "loading from key" is faster. (If you have several inputs you want to click the "advanced options " button and disable the "clear existing inputs" as otherwise it probably can only load one key).
When all are loaded you should check they add up to the balance you expect. Then paste a destination address into the tx page and enter the output value (same as total inputs, which will show in the fee field). Whatever is not sent to an output will remain as fee so if the output value matches total input values then the fee should be zero.
Click submit and it should create a raw tx (hex data). You can proceed to Verify tab (copy/paste hex data, it doesn't seem to do that for you) which allows decoding it again to check it matches what you expect. And then to Sign (requires WIF key(s) here) and to Broadcast. 
If that all works then you should see the txid and look it up on a block explorer and it will show as unconfirmed. It may or may not ever get confirmed.
**edit:** If you "load" outputs from address to create the tx first, save the tx data to file. Then you can save the coinb.in page to a local disk and work offline (disconnected) for the signing step to be sure that your keys aren't sent off to someone. The last step of broadcasting needs to be done online again but that step isn't dangerous. Just copy/paste final signed tx hex data and paste in the Broadcast page online. For the amount you are dealing with I'd just do it all online.

Then this is probably a matter of a unconfirmed tx being dropped by the network after you saw it. Was it sent from blockchain.info? They seem to be dropping txs quicker than others and some complain of txs being dropped even when shown as confirmed (buggy). If you have the tx id or even the address then check it on other block sites like    and see if the tx still shows up.
If the tx has been dropped then it will be as if the tx was not sent and show up again in the originating wallet / address. It may take a while as it showing up depends on it being dropped by the node that is handling that wallet (origin) and nodes all make their own choice about dropping txs - the default time is 72 hours but it's changeable.

Not sure what you mean by "only allow me to access my funds". Yes, that's what wallets do regardless of having the blockchain or not. When you have the blockchain you can verify valid txs yourself, independently. When you use a "light" client wallet you depend in some way, to various extents, on another agent to verify the blockchain, and therefore the validity of txs. But both methods support creating key/address pairs, signing txs, signing messages, sending and receiving bitcoin.
Electrum connects to a server that keeps the blockchain. And it verifies block headers against alternate servers to help double check that fake txs are not accepted by it's server, and therefore it is more trustworthy. The server asks for addresses to get tx history and monitor for incoming txs. So the server does know what addresses are in your wallet (not so private), but by default the servers do not log address-IP relationships. It is possible for some server operator to modify it to track addresses.
Some people run Electrum over Tor (it supports that use) to get more privacy as this ensures servers don't associate wallet addresses with real IP addresses.
**edit** - oh, you may be asking if the wallets keep your own private keys locally for you. Yes, all these wallets generate and store your own keys. You actually control your own funds. Just be absolutely sure to write down your seed word list - that allows restoring a corrupt or deleted wallet if ever need be. Also, all these wallets depend on system security for secure keys. If your system is hacked your keys may be at risk. The only way to avoid that is to use hardware wallets or offline/paper wallets - highly recommended for high value wallets.
Electrum supports working with all the well known hardware wallets, eg. Ledger, Trezor, Keepkey. These wallets store the keys in physically secure hardware to be malware proof. They do actual tx signing in the hardware but allow Electrum to manage addresses and tx history.

I have some BIP38 code that could be easily adapted to brute forcing in about 20 minutes code changes. But BIP38 uses scrypt and even with very limited variations it will be very slow. If you have no other choice then pm me the type of variations you need to try, eg. number of digits and char ranges, and I can adapt a cracker script for you. I have one for Electrum which with minor tweaks would work for BIP38. Expect to let it run for hours,days,weeks maybe.

I guess if you want to redefine CPU. But no, having done FPGA designs in VHDL myself I do completely understand what a CPU is. And an ASIC may or may not have a CPU in it. Mining ASICs generally speaking do not have a CPU - that is they do not fetch and execute generalized instruction sets. They may have some logic for handling support functions like communication but in large part most of the ASIC design is pipelined dedicated hashing units which cannot in any way handle instruction sets.

Oh, that's weird. I'd guess some buggy sync issue then. Not supposed to happen like this.
Maybe try a different server in case the one you're on has rebooted and cleared out it's mempool and cannot provide data on the unconfirmed tx.
I guess I'd suggest trying to restore the wallet fresh in a new file. 
Or, if me, I'd probably go into the wallet file and hack out any json records related to the unconfirmed tx_id but that may be a bit too technical and error prone (make a file backup first). And then get it to re-sync again and it should show up properly.

Txs sent with the intent of clogging up the system. There is no flag or special condition that says "I'm spam". In practice there is no difference and no reason for miners to reject spam as they are paying fees too. Indication of attack is a sudden jump to 5-10x tx volume in a very short time. Those users promoting big blocks use it as justification and pretend it's not spam but organic natural growth (that just happens to hit suddenly).

Saving data online is only as good as the login password for the service you use. If you keep your password on a local system (or worse on paper) then someone only need get your paper and the password. So actually you are building security by obscurity - which is a no-no in the security world, though better than nothing.
Even worse - lets say someone hacks your online presence and gets both the 12 words and your home address. Now they know where to come for the other 12 words. Would they bother? Maybe, if they knew the value was high.
IMO it's too bad they didn't have enough forethought to build in BIP38 style encryption to the BIP32/39 scheme, even as an option. Having that standardized would have made it more widespread to save a word list that also needed a password to decrypt. Electrum does now optionally support this for it's default wallet but I don't think that is a BIP standard and not supported by hardware wallets.
If there was a small BIP39 utility for generalized binary &lt;&gt; word list conversion then you could easily use Shamir Sharing to create M-of-N word lists where each part is both encrypted and hand writable. A word list is only really an advantage for hand written storage.
**edit:** Having browsed the BIP39 docs I now see that they do incorporate BIP38 (PBKDF2) style encryption as an option using an appended passphrase to the word list. I don't know if the Nano supports this but if it does then you should definitely use that option as well. Maybe that's what Electrum is now supporting but haven't checked that out yet.

Electrum (on Tails or not) is depending on a random Electrum server. He is describing how to run your own node on Tor and then connect to it with an SPV client to gain the benefit of a mobile phone wallet with anonymity. Running your own node gives you a higher level of certainty that you have reliable tx information.
The two main disadvantages of using Electrum are that (a) the server can log your IP and associate it with addresses you use (mitigated by Tor with Tails), and (b) a malicious Electrum server could send you false info about your addresses and txs. It cannot alter txs or steal funds but could cause you problems based on bad info. I've yet to hear of anyone actually having that happen but it is in theory possible.

Electrum and Core may differ in how they estimate a suitable fee but they should both be pretty close. I know Electrum gives you a choice to set fee dynamically (using a small slider to choose how fast you need it confirmed) or manually set it yourself. Not sure what Core is doing now but I believe they give you similar options.
Coinbase - as far as I know they pay the fee but I'm not sure how much they include or if it ensures fast confirmation. I'm not a Coinbase user.
Both Core and Electrum support HD wallets. Electrum always did (it was the first to offer this type of wallet) and Core started in a fairly recent version. HD = Hierarchical Deterministic, which means they use a **seed value** to generate a chain of key/address pairs in the wallet. The seed is a random 128 or 256 bit number that for ease of use is usually encoded as a sequence of words. As long as you safely store the seed words you can recover all keys in the wallet using the same generation method in future. It's critical with HD wallets you write down and keep safe your seed word list. Non-HD wallets require that you keep updated backups of the wallet file which contains all your keys. So HD wallets are a big improvement in ease of use and most software uses this method now.
The actual generation method varies according to wallet software. There is some standardization but it's not very rigid and interpretations vary. Electrum, by default, uses their own method but does support restoring some other wallets seeds. In Bitcoin-land standards are usually referred by BIP number (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals). BIP32, 39, and 44 refer to different aspects of HD seed methods. But within those there are various options that sometimes make compatibility tricky. The details are very technical but bottom line is it's best to not assume a seed from one wallet software works with another, unless you test it or have a reliable report it does.
As mentioned above Electrum can restore several types of BIP39 seeds which makes it useful as alternative to Mycelium, Copay, Trezor, Ledger and others. If you want to explore technical details of HD seeds you can read the [BIPs]( or play with this [BIP39 tool](

If the tx wasn't sent then no need to deal with eGifter as they never received anything - if they had, the timer would have stopped the countdown. If not sent then the btc are still in your wallet but you may have a software issue to fix before being able to see the btc. Only critical thing here is that you have a backup of your wallet/keys. You can only lose btc if you lose the keys (barring malware/hacker theft). If you have the xpub for your wallet then I'd suggest using that to check btc on another tool. Some explorers allow checking an **xpub** (never enter an **xprv** online though) eg. blockchain.info does.

That's right. It sounds like the Electrum wallet was not created correctly and isn't matching the blockchain.info one. If you know one or more of the addresses you had in your blockchain.info wallet then you can check them against the Electrum address list (Ctrl-A). They should be there and if not then that confirms it's not showing you the same wallet.
Try following the steps again:
1. File, New/Restore
2. Enter file name you want for the new wallet
3. Choose "standard wallet". Next.
4. Choose "I already have a seed". Next.
5. Click "options" and select "BIP39 Seed". Ok.
6. Enter the 12 words and make sure they are spelled correctly (US spelling not British). Next.
7. Leave value 0. Next.
8. Enter a strong password (nothing to do with blockchain.info password). Next.
Electrum should generate addresses and synchronize your wallet history. It should show addresses the same as your blockchain.info wallet. If still nothing then there must be some other reason like maybe an older version wallet seed that is not supported (ie. not BIP39) or something else and doesn't indicate anything about your real wallet status.

Stop using this wallet. It's too damn easy to get phished and they have had too many problems in the past. Get your own wallet software on your own system and if you have a large amount of funds then get a hardware wallet (or use Electrum offline signing if that's too costly for you). If you use blockchain.info then sooner or later you will regret it. Just look back on this reddit history for examples.
BTW you can create an Electrum wallet from the blockchain.info backup seed phrase. That wallet will allow you to operate entirely independently of the web site (and also show your history) but I would not consider it "secure" since the seed phrase has been "online".
To do this install [Electrum]( from the official web site and select menu File, New/Restore. Choose "Standard Wallet", "I already have a seed". When prompted for seed words select options and check "BIP39 Seed" and enter words. It is possible to get the master public key (xpub) and use that for a watch-only wallet for offline signing but since this seed has been online it's not the best practice.

Arrgh. Silly me. Re-calc @ $700:
14000 / 2141432449 * 6 * 12.5 * $700 / 1.471 = 0.234 US$/kWh
Not taking into account time(?), capital costs (~$2300), pool fees (2%).
But lets say you bought equipment on a credit card and paid off from revenue over a year @ 15.2% (simple) with no down time:
$2300 * 1.152 / 8760 hours = 0.302 US$/hour
Revenue with pool fee:  0.234 - 2% = 0.229
Subtract capital cost: 0.229 - 0.302 = **0.073 loss**
ie. doesn't matter what your power cost is you will lose money dependent on how you finance the equipment. You may get away with break even at free electricity but if you're planning to hold btc until they go up you are better to apply capital to btc directly.
The other huge factor this ignores is increasing difficulty - that makes revenue drop every two weeks unless trends reverse.

The obvious way is to sell your btc in India and buy them back in USA for a lower price. The problem is the cost (and delay) of sending from your India account to your US account to re-balance to your original state (so you can repeat it). Other than the risk of money tied up in bank transfers you can negate trading risk by executing both trades at (or very close to) the same time. That is, you know your profit going in based on your bank fees and exchange price differences (less fees). You do have some risk related to briefly holding btc/fiat on exchanges.
The alternative, which adds more risk, is to hold the rupee on the exchange in India hoping that other people arbitrage the premium away (like you did) and when the price gets close to the US price again you buy back your btc again. You have three risks here:
1. The exchange gets hacked and you lose btc and/or rupees. Or the exchange decides to put a hold on your funds.
2. The buy pressure increases and the btc:rupee price increases instead of falling.
3. The rupee falls relative to other currencies and that forces the btc:rupee price up.

Wallets typically handle QR codes easily. I'm not sure many have tap-to-pay support but maybe it's possible. I think NFC is supported by a few maybe. 
It may be possible to pass receipt info via BIP70 pmt requests but it's not (easily) possible to embed the info in the blockchain tx. If the info was in the pmt request at POS then wallet software could log it. The times I've had pmt requests with my mobile wallet I haven't seen receipt info - just vendor name and amount.
With SegWit activated removing malleability the tx id would be safe to use as a link for receipt info. There would just need to be a way to communicate it at POS. It seems it could have some privacy down sides though.

The address still holds balance with no tx pending:
I'd suggest doing a private key export for that address and then a sweep on your new HD wallet. I don't use MultiBit HD so I'm not sure it has that ability but it should. I use Electrum myself and have never had issues like this. You may want to switch. If so then install Electrum and create a new wallet. Write down the seed words safely. Choose menu item Wallet, Private Keys, Sweep and paste in the private key for address above. Make sure decent fee is included. Send tx. That should sweep the balance on your old address into Electrum regardless of Multibit Classic not showing it for whatever reason.

When the account holder disputes the pmt Paypal will take the pmt back from you but you cannot take the btc back.

Selling btc for credit card entails a high degree of risk. All else being equal that risk must be paid for or else the trader will soon be out of business. In most cases the risk forces extra work like ID verification, residence confirmation, phone calls etc. Not only does this take time and money but it slows down trade volume.
The second reason is that with credit cards you have one or few trade parties. Few parties means a smaller market and small markets typically have higher spreads than larger ones due to more competition. On an exchange you have potentially thousands of trade parties standing ready to trade at some price. The cost to move in and out of positions is low, therefore the spread can be low and still be profitable.

That's odd. I helped someone a few days back with a stuck tx and he was able to spend the unconfirmed output. I've never had to do it for myself and haven't seen a setting for that. 
The address you are trying should have a triangle at left and when clicked show the tx_id:index. If not then it's not the correct address. You can right click the unconfirmed tx in the history screen and choose "details". It should show the output address highlighted in yellow. If you don't see the unconfirmed tx in history then that would also explain not being able to spend as it has not sync'd. Typically closing and re-opening Electrum 1 or a few times will fix any sync issue.
Otherwise, not sure why it doesn't allow spending unconfirmed outputs.

Bitcoin doesn't have either of those issues, and it's been made very clear by US law enforcement that bitcoin is not illegal even though it may be used by criminals in illegal ways (just like any other currency).

It seems like it would be worthwhile creating an open source FPGA based block/tx processor. I was thinking of this earlier as a co-processor that may speed up verification for eg. a raspberry pi but it may make even more sense as a secure tx verifier. I'd imagined a Xilinx Artix7 35T (~$25)(I have a cheap dev kit) mounted on the expansion port of a raspberry pi (could as easily be a PCI board for x86) with SATA phy/core to dedicated hard disk. bitcoind could handle peering and receive blocks and writes to the FPGA where the hardware verifies and commits to disk.

Another thing that plays a big part, which I read about but forgot before, is that until it reaches the last checkpoint it doesn't do actual signature verification, and then after that it does. So on a raspi the EC math for that is very slow, and won't kick in til much later. I think maybe the last checkpoint is at 295000 so it should be much slower on a raspi after that.

You shuld ask your customers if they'd consider paying with BTC and maybe offer a discount to get them started. Maybe they would save money on transfers too. Probably most of them haven't even considered, or heard of it, so it may be a challenge to bring them on board.
In Canada for conversion to CAD$ you may want to look at QuadrigaCX exchange in Vancouver. They're well known and have been around quite a while. I've sold btc there and had it deposit via Interac to my bank without hassles at all.
One of the nice things about accepting it is once you have btc you don't have to worry about it being reversed / charged back.

I've done this myself recently with an HW.1, Electrum and an offline boot usb stick as a 2 of 3 multisig long term solution. I don't have a tutorial for you but can answer questions. I gave 1 of the 3 seeds each to a parent in case something happens to me. I need the HW.1 and my offline boot to sign a tx but if either or both of those get lost/corrupted I can fall back on contacting parents, or using backup seeds.
It was pretty easy to setup. I simply chose New, Restore then Multisig wallet option, once on my desktop with HW.1 and twice on my offline boot without HW.1. Each time on the offline boot I wrote down the seed and saved the xpub to usb stick. Then I came back to the desktop wallet and pasted in each xpub in answer to prompts for a cosignor. Electrum then generated the final wallet. I have 3 seeds written on paper and have tested out the wallet with txs in and out. It's up to you how you deal with the seeds but you need to be sure at least 2 are recoverable in an emergency, but preferably not stored together.

Ah, yes. Just realized it only shows Huobi and you cannot alter what exchanges show on top line. I kind of wanted the USD price too. So I wrote up a small greasemonkey script for showing USD on bitcoinwisdom when it's on a Chinese exchange. I happened to already have a script running on this page so for me it was just a simple tweak (though it took a while to get it right).
If anyone cares here is the greasemonkey script which I have tested and am using on this site for myself. If you have the greasemonkey addon then adding this as a user script will give you CNY = USD in the price area. Pretty nice actually. It has another bonus but that's up to users to uncomment. ;)

Don't send again unless you want your friend to have 2x or 3x the bitcoin. Showing up in your wallet has nothing to do with whether they are received by the receiver. If your txs show up on a [block explorer]( with confirmations then they are done, received. Not showing up in a wallet is a wallet issue like not sync'd or something else. What wallet software is not showing the txs?
Double spending bitcoins is something different from just sending bitcoins again. Double spending involves sending bitcoins that make use of the same inputs so that only one of multiple txs gets confirmed. If you have multiple confirmed txs then they cannot be double spends. Double spends cannot be confirmed - one will always be invalid and dropped. Wallet software generally will not allow double spending and the network will usually prevent it unless it happens quickly and via different nodes.

That's going to really gum up LBC. It's really in LBCs interest to find a workaround like using CPFP to bump the fee and send back to same address or next one in users address list. Unfortunate you cannot do anything because not your key. Your counterparty can use CPFP on the change but I'm guessing doing that is DOA since they don't even understand about fees.

Empty blocks are possible and still happen even now. Miners still get paid for empty blocks as technically they're not empty but have a "coinbase" tx by definition that pays the miner. A lot of the early blocks were empty and at that time bitcoins had no monetary value so transactions were just about testing the system not carrying out trades.

I wouldn't laugh too hard. When you go to spend that output you'll also probably pay more than it's worth in fees. You might want to hold it until someday when Schnorr gets activated. If you use Electrum you can freeze that address to prevent it being used in a tx.

Now you're using Electrum it is possible to fix this with CPFP tx. I explained this to another user at this link:
@_date: 2016-11-12 01:54:15
Most wallets will try to estimate a suitable fee. Some better than others. The fee does not depend on the btc amount but on the byte size of the tx. This varies mostly according to how many inputs and outputs it has. If you are sending your entire wallet balance (no matter what actual amount) then you likely have 1 output. But if you received tiny payments in your wallet then all those combining into one amount means many inputs, and that increases the size.
What wallet are you using? Does it allow you to dee the tx details - inputs and outputs, and maybe byte size? 
There are no doubt some calculators around (google). I've never bothered looking. It's simply bytes*cost_in_satoshi_per_byte (eg. 250 x 10). 
@_date: 2016-11-07 23:32:10
Hardly enough compensation for this but better than nothing.
@_date: 2016-11-22 08:57:19
And being a multisig wallet it's not simple to import to another wallet like Electrum. I'd say you probably should complain to whoever sent them. They should re-send with higher fee but probably won't want to until they're dropped. 
The txs will eventually get dropped by the network and you will not receive them. Otherwise wait I guess; they may eventually get confirmed but kind of unlikely.

Flip 4 coins at a time making a 4 bit word, eg. 1011. Convert to hex, which you can do easily in your head, eg. 1011 = 8+2+1 = B. Write down 32 in a row and use as a seed for Electrum offline. Take a photo of the xpub QR code (menu Wallet, Master Public Key) and shut down.
Open Electrum on your desktop and select File, New/Restore, Standard, "I have a private/public key". Click the QR icon and snap the photo you took. You now have an online watch-only wallet for the entirely offline coin flipped seeded wallet. Much more flexible than flipping coins for each single key you need.
If you really insist on single keys then no problem - just flip 64 x 4-bit hex digits, same way, and plug into an address converter like bitaddress.org (offline).

Yes, though while doing the initial sync you're not going to do much else. I'd suggest downloading and syncing first on a faster desktop system and moving the data (or hard disk) over to the pi. Once sync'd it uses little cpu and other things can share the resources. Not sure how well a game emulator will work as it may get choppy when a new block comes in and sucks up some cpu. I used to have no prob running a torrent client and wifi router at same time. It's probably better if it isn't real-time game stuff. Anyway, bitcoin will run on raspbian fine. Just install the armhf version from debian repo. Same for tor.

I don't think there is any way to add the paper wallet key you have to a hardware wallet. They are expressly designed such that the keys never leave the chip. Provided software likely can sweep the paper wallets but only on a live system. The best you can hope for is to use an offline boot system to spend the paper wallet btc into the new hardware wallet. 
I would do an offline spend like this:
Install Electrum on your desktop and create a watch-only wallet from the address(es) of your paper wallet(s). That is File, New/Restore; Watch Bitcoin addresses. Paste any addresses you have on paper. Your keys are not exposed at all. It will create a wallet containing only those addresses and sync them with current unspent outputs and total. Create a send tx to your hardware wallet address. Click "Max" on Send screen to sweep all btc, check fee is suitable, then Preview and Save. Store the unsigned tx on a usb stick.
Now create an offline boot usb stick (a second one) and install Electrum as well (or use Tails which already has Electrum). Disconnect and boot on the air gapped system with this usb stick. Start Electrum. Select File, New/Restore, Standard wallet. This time select "I have public/private keys", and paste in the private keys matching the addresses you used before. This will create the offline wallet with addresses matching the saved tx. Now choose Tools, Load transaction and load the tx file from first usb stick. Sign the tx, and save again to the tx usb stick.
Shut down air gap system and return to online system. Open Electrum wallet and select Tools, Load transaction, select signed tx from usb stick. Click "Broadcast". Open your hardware wallet to monitor the incoming btc tx.
The only potential risks here are Tails (usb boot) being infected (be sure to verify iso file when downloading), or bad usb firmware, which is much less likely than an infected live system. Either way, at worst it can only alter destination address - so visually double check it before signing.

If you start working with single keys from a BIP39 wallet then you are more likely to screw it up than simply using your wallet as was designed. Using single keys is taking a step backwards to the days of paper wallets. One of the issues that caught people losing money was not handling change addresses correctly when spending from single keys. But there are other problems like mpk exposure with a single key exposing the entire chain. Also, if a seed is found or forced out then all is lost anyway - little to gain.
I would recommend using a BIP39 seed with three levels of passphrase. 
1. No passphrase for coins you expect to be taken if the seed ever gets exposed. Consider it daily use like the one in your pocket.
2. A passphrase for more substantial btc that may be forced upon duress but is likely safe to any seed discovery. This passphrase may be something you remember.
3. A long secondary passphrase for long term substantial btc you want to keep secure. This is as good as having another seed phrase wallet. Just store that passphrase hidden safely.
Hammer your seed words into metal for fire safety.
Creating your seed words with dice is a good idea. [Here's a way to do it]( that's been around for years and without any software. I also wrote a [post]( about doing it for 24 word seeds.

I doubt it. There's been little talk of node rewards happening and pruned nodes probably don't warrant it even if there was.
If you're thinking of LN fees as a reward then a phone isn't really the right place to do that. You'd need a more stable connection for reliability. Probably a VPS server at very least and some failover / redundancy. LN nodes will have timelock contracts that need to be monitored and executed, so unplanned dropouts could be costly, not to mention reputation loss.

The security card is needed for regular (non-multisig) wallets. It can also be used for pairing a mobile phone which is a better authentication method. Right now Electrum doesn't support the mobile auth but I am currently writing and testing an update for that - so maybe in a week or so.

If you're going to do this you might look into support for a method that is more flexible and private such as [paynyms]( or BIP47 reusable payment codes.

@_date: 2016-11-22 08:47:03
Ok. I haven't used bitgo. To be able to fix this you would need to be able to spend again to yourself from these two txs. If you have other btc in your wallet that may not be possible to do in your wallet (it depends if it allows selecting spend from address). If this is your only btc in the wallet and it allows spending unconfirmed tx then it may work. It still depends on txs being in miners mempools.
You make a pmt to your own address and include a fee that is enough to pay for previous unconfirmed and current new tx. So in this case I'd suggest (60 sat/byte x (223+370+500) = 0.655 mbtc = 0.000655). Better to go a bit higher - maybe 0.0008 (which is about 0.58 US$ - quite high but you're overpaying for all 3 txs to try and make sure it gets enough priority to be mined soon).

No, not without serious hacking. It's not really a full hardware wallet. It has a private self generated key stored in the Atmel secure storage chip. It can sign messages to prove it has the key matching the address it exposes. 
It just behaves like a read-only USB mass storage device.
With some hacking you may be able to remove/replace the chips or re-program them but they would lose their manufacturer key proving genuine origin, and unique private key. 
I'm not sure how it signs a message if read-only. Somehow you must tell it the text to sign, or perhaps it generates random time-based data, signs it and then you can verify using the address only.

Personally if the price difference is low I'd buy from Singapore to avoid being in the US tracking system and hassles with KYC/AML. I'm sure Singapore has that too. I'd just have a look at which is more draconian before choosing based solely on price.
In the end bitcoins are bitcoins and if you invest a substanial amount then be sure to create an offline cold wallet or buy a hardware wallet (Trezor/Ledger/Keepkey etc.) and move the btc to that wallet. Any of these web wallets on exchanges are prone to hacking and freezing your btc at any time.

So with no change and assuming the tx didn't send to a another wallet you own then you cannot fix this using CPFP. However, if you say 0.000 but that's only because the phone doesn't show enough digits for a tiny change output then it can work.

In your case the tx has 3 outputs. That makes it bigger and the fee is dependent on byte size. So for you 0.20212/407 bytes = 50 sat/byte. That's not too bad normally but right now the network is being pounded and txs don't go through quickly unless &gt; 80 sat/byte. You can fix this with CPFP as explained above.
@_date: 2016-11-23 11:34:35
Your comment just made me realize you may not be able to do it. If the address 1AwEMx1szGmdnGDi6EWfpUYN7545hhVWmD is not in your wallet (you cannot send from it) then CPFP won't work. I take it that you sent your entire balance over to that address? With no change output, and no control over that address the only way left is to double spend the original tx, and that is not likely to work either.
The problem with CPFP is that you need control of an output from the tx. Usually change back to your wallet allows this. Or if the tx was going into your wallet then that also allows fixing it. By sending the entire output to the other account you have no more control over it. Let me know if that address above is yours as then it can work.

Electrum has the ability to sign messages, menu Tools, Sign/Verify message. So you could create a text declaring you are holding X btc on Y address and then sign it with the key of that address.
They can verify the message using the address alone. The problem is that their underwriter won't know how if they haven't done it before. But even worse they probably won't accept btc as collateral anyway because it is not held by a third party - that is, they cannot take them from you if need be. 
That's the bottom line with collateral - it's useless if they cannot take them and they won't trust that you'll just sign over the funds when things go sideways.

Bitcoin started with absolutely no value. What makes him or anyone think that "a wide group of people" would bother wasting their time to obtain this worthless item? Bitcoin actually came very close by allowing anyone who knew about it and was intersted enough to run software making worthless tokens take part.
The argument is pure hindsight is 20/20 baloney. Even today anyone who wants worthless tokens can start mining for near zero cost and make their own - so what's the difference? If Bitcoin had started by distributing it evenly to everyone then it would never have gained value except by some small group buying them up for near zero cost and you'd be back at the same result. It's fantasy.

Use Electrum. It has coin control.
Select address with balance in the address list (Ctrl-A) and choose right click, "Send From". That adds the output of that address to the tx (if there are multiple delete all but one). Send half to your self by copy/pasting another address from your address list.
If you want to get fancy then choose Tools, "Pay to many" and add multiple addresses from your list to split N ways in one tx. One address, amount pair per line. You can split an address to whatever number smaller amounts in one tx alone.

Yes. I helped someone with this yesterday. You should have exported your keys using the option on the settings menu but if you didn't then you can visit the wayback machine at  and search for rushwallet.com. There is some recent copies like one on Jul 8th. Open that page and then save it on your local system as "complete web page". Now when you open it as a file locally you can add your hash-id to the url ( reload, and it will recover your wallet. Close the archive.org header at top and click the little gear icon (settings). Now you can use the Export private key button. Save that private key safely or import or sweep it into a new wallet depending on what you want to do. I verified this works yesterday.

If you do nothing they will either get confirmed or be dropped and return to the originating wallet.
If your wallet allows spending unconfirmed balance to yourself then it can be fixed but in this case it sounds like it is not letting you spend. Some wallets (like Electrum) will let you create a tx using unconfirmed outputs which could fix this.

It's pretty straight forward. I'll just give you and others a brief overview of how this works.
When you want to receive a pmt a new address is generated. Whatever you receive then sits on that address (as an output). Mycelium doesn't provide you with the address again (it steps forward to the next one) but it's still valid so you could later send more pmts to that address. You would have multiple outputs at that address. The wallet simply adds up the outputs on all wallet addresses to create your total balance.
When you spend from the wallet it selects some of those outputs to become inputs on your tx. The ones not selected simply remain as is. Typically the sum of selected outputs won't exactly equal your requested pmt amount so a new address will be generated for the "change" (left over from total selected outputs minus pmt amount). So in that way sending a pmt can also add another address to the wallet, not just receiving.
The sequence of addresses generated is "deterministic". That is, starting with a seed it will always generate the same addresses in the same order. That's why you can restore from seed. The wallet only need remember the count of how many addresses have been used and it can always generate all used addresses from seed.
When you restore from seed it doesn't know the address count. So instead it keeps generating addresses as long as it finds existing outputs on the blockchain. It may do extras just to be sure. This extra count is often called the "gap limit", ie. the gap between last used address and final address checked. 
In Mycelium it doesn't show you "future" addresses so the gap limit only needs to be 1, but other software like Electrum gives you a list of 20 unused "future" addresses (though they are now hidden in the addresses tab), ie. the gap limit is 20.
The wallet doesn't care how much is sitting on any address or try to combine or alter that. Spending from the wallet may use some up but the total address list is always recoverable so it doesn't really matter how many are there, used or empty.

I think many people think of hardware open source meaning simply they can buy parts and build. They trust the datasheet fully describes the inside of a chip. When you start talking about nation states backdooring chips it's actually quite unknown.
I'm not really familiar with the FE310 but I think I saw the flash is external. If true then that means it's impossible to embed secure data. You're pretty much back to using a secure element.

You would only lock btc if you were going to send pmts. You're telling the node you have that btc, they can count on it.
If you are only receiving then they would need to lock btc for you. At least, that's my understanding right now. And in that case you need some way to be sure the close can be executed before expiry. I guess that is worked out. It will need to be robust whatever happens (including possible hacks, MITM attacks etc).
With my current understanding it seems sending pmts is safe but receiving them needs failover redundancy. That is ok for vendors but in the case of transient home users it may need a helper. Maybe that aspect is covered in the LN white paper but I don't recall off hand. I read it but the details are a bit boggling.

The way I would do it is either install Mint Linux (others ok too) and use that or alternately, and probably more flexible especially if you aren't really a linux user, is to create a bootable usb stick or "live boot" Linux (many tutorials around). Boot on that on most any system temporarily. In both cases download and verify the [Electrum AppImage]( for Linux. 
It's important to disconnect from the internet before booting in Linux and to make sure that system (or boot usb) does not ever boot while connected later. Wipe after use or keep securely stored if planning to re-use. If you simply want to generate the xpub string then wiping it using secure-delete package or shred is better.
@_date: 2016-11-03 20:34:24
Just normal internet access; not even especially fast. Most miners would connect to a pool website. It's simple - you sign up with a pool, get some login/connect id and then configure the miner to use that. In that case it's the pool that builds the block and submits it to the network. The miners connected to the pool just do hashing on the block. This is why people complain it's too centralized - there are not that many pools. Pools allow many small miners to share the proceeds of a block which otherwise they may never find alone.
@_date: 2016-11-27 04:43:21
Nodes could just have an option to prioritize txs when the connected node is version 0.13.1? Nasty I know. If nodes held back txs for old nodes until a new block is found then chances are txs would be included by 0.13.1 miners before being seen by old version miners.

Electrum can now also restore a Mycelium seed allowing the same wallet on desktop and mobile. That may be handy for some people. I tested it out a couple weeks back but I think it may only be in newest versions.
And Electrum integrates Ledger and Trezor which makes it even more useful as a primary wallet choice. The only down side really is you trust random Electrum servers with address lookups. You can run your own server on top a node to offset this but it's resource hungry so it'll be great when this aspect is improved.
@_date: 2016-12-20 07:54:10
Electrum doesn't decide if txs confirm but it can have issues with showing the actual state on the network if it gets behind, doesn't sync, or the server chosen is lagging. I'd definitely update to 2.7+ as it fixes some issues and adds worthwhile new features like RBF.

Depends on whether that is worthwhile for you. It need not, but also if reliability and independence are critical then you probably should. Pruning can be used as you only need the UTXO set for this. You actually only need to pull new blocks for this (~1MB every 10 min. from an existing API like blockchain.info, insight.io, blockr.io etc.), but that does make you dependent on whoever you get the block data from. Running a pruned node is probably a good idea but not strictly mandatory.
Running a pruned node has the advantage you can hook on to the new block notification to trigger invoice updating db scan - which is very efficient, rather than polling some external service (a websocket feed is another option). A pruned node is as little as 550 MB but you may choose any size that you have space for.

Ok. If you sent the entire wallet balance out you may not have any or enough left to do another tx. In that case CPFP won't work for you. But if you do have some left now it can work quickly enough. 
If you plan to delete the wallet be sure that you shred/wipe it rather than simply delete (assuming there is some balance left). If very little remains and you never will use those addresses/keys again then it's not important. But if eg. it's the same wallet as your Trezor (not a great idea anyway) then it must be securely deleted otherwise it is possible to undelete the wallet later.

Backing this up with numbers, I've been working on my [sqlChain]( project to create a compact sql layer on top of bitcoind. In the process of syncing on a VPS (using manual pruning mode) I started out with both running together but bitcoind got so far ahead, and my intent being to keep disk size usage down, I ended up pausing it so that sqlchain could catch up (as it catches up blocks are pruned so total disk space goes down or stays about the same). 
Here are my results at a couple points:
    both together - 11 hours run time (4 vCPUs)
     197098 / btc 350559
    pruned 21 out of 251 files
    dux /var/data
    1.8G	/var/data/mysql
    776K	/var/data/www
    34G	    /var/data/bitcoin
    1.9G	/var/data/sqlchain
    38G	    /var/data
    bitcoind port blocked, sqlchain only - 9 more hours 
     304297 / btc 350559
    pruned 146 out of 251 files
    dux /var/data
    12G	    /var/data/mysql
    776K	/var/data/www
    16G	    /var/data/bitcoin
    12G	    /var/data/sqlchain
    39G	    /var/data
My intention in this project is for a fully indexed DB that uses less space, but not to worry about sync time, so this has been working reasonably well. This is also testing for PR# 7871.
The sqlchain sql DB can be used for an electrum server, explorer type web site, or whatever. I used every trick I could think of to reduce data size without actually throwing out anything. In the past the sql layers I found used up to 10x the disk space of the blockchain. The /var/data/sqlchain directory is signature data in a blob which can be easily stripped, but tx,address,utxo data is all in sql tables (with indexing).
Part of the slowdown is my vps operator probably throttled my available cpu as it ran high for so long. Not sure but probable. I don't have access to a dedicated server in a data center to get consistent measurements.
Anyway, posted this to show real world how much longer syncing takes with sql. It hasn't even hit the hard part yet (after 350k blocks ~ 50%).

Electrum can restore a BIP39 seed, which I think is why he wants an offline BIP39 generator. He could use that and restore the seed in Electrum to have a fully compatible BIP39 wallet.
The BIP39 word list is in the Electrum lib/wordlist directory (and github) so if you can roll dice to get a value from 1 to 2048 then you can manually select words and write down a seed. 
2048 = 2^11 so that's (2 x D16 dice and 1 x D8 die) multiply the numbers together to get a index into the word list. You could use (3 x D16 dice) rolls and divide by 2. As long as you don't have unused values it won't be skewed.
edit - Actually now I think about it you can't just multiply the numbers. You'd need to multiply the first by 128, next by 8, add last (or by 16 instead of 8 if using 3xD16).

If they are on that address but the address is not in your wallet then presumably you somehow sent them to the wrong address. There is malware and phishing sites that will alter addresses "in flight", ie. on clipboard or in transit when SSL not used. It's worth carefully determining how the address you sent to ended up in the transaction, and whether a mistake or subversion occurred. Trezor cannot prevent a bad address being presented to you (before it sees it).
BIP70 helps a lot with verifying correct address but many vendors are not using it yet. I can only guess without info about address presentation.

Yes, using the public key but not the address. Electrum provides this function on it's menu (select an address, right click, encrypt/decrypt) but in general you're not going to have someone's public key so I'm not sure how useful this is. You can not derive a public key from an address.

What wallet software are you using? Encrypting your wallet should not affect any use of the keys or addresses but I cannot speak to your particular software without knowing what it is. If, for example, encrypting forced you to create a new wallet with new keys then you should not delete the old one. 
With the wallets I'm familiar with, eg. Electrum, adding a password encrypts only the seed in the wallet file and nothing else changes. 
As long as you can get your keys and use them any addresses given out will work. Wallets don't contain actual Bitcoin - they contain either a seed or keys that allow signing txs on the network. You can still receive btc if your wallet is deleted, but without the keys you cannot spend them. So rule  in Bitcoin is keep your seed or keys very safe. 
(A seed is used to generate keys; most wallets now use a seed rather than storing a bunch of keys)

Somewhat, but not really. It is the secure element in Ledger that is closed and you have access to source code that operates around it. Since it is the only code on the device you have some assurance the secure element cannot bypass that code and communicate externally. But in a Samsung there may likewise be a secure element that is closed, and you may likewise have a wallet that uses it that is open source (someday?) but you also have a generic device which is running many other programs, and an OS which you have little insight into, any of which could be malicious by accessing the secure element or a back door within it. 
Of course, with any device physical control changes things. On the Trezor there are ways to hack it when in physical possession, and on a Ledger the firmware could be replaced with one that knows how to access a back door in the secure element. But then physical possession of a seed word list is also possible so nothing is perfect (an added passphrase is  necessary for any protection against physical control).

**Malleability** (since not covered above) is the ability to create two functionally identical txs with differing ids, making it impossible to unique track txs (and bind in contracts). Bitcoin currently allows this but it's problematic for many advanced uses where tx ids must be determinate.
**Schnorr** or Aggregated Signatures is a different signature method that allows collapsing many inputs into a single one. This would save space and fees on large txs.
**Script-versioning** (better) is part of the SegWit update that enables an easier way of handling protocol changes in the future.
**MimbleWimble** is a mind blowing alternate crypto system that can be implemented as a sidechain or altcoin and allows massive pruning of history and blocks (but gives up scripting).
**Sidechains** are separate blockchains, usually with different properties, that are grafted to Bitcoin where locking btc permits moving value onto the sidechain and back again.

0.0000408 = 0.0408 mbtc or about 16 sat/byte (small 250 byte tx) is very low but if you have a tx with several small inputs then likely it's even less and maybe below the minimum fee level for the network.
So bottom line, probably just too low a fee for the given tx byte size, more so if you received many small txs into your wallet. Besides being below the minimum your wallet is doing you a favour by not letting you send a tx that may never confirm.

Bitcoin is priced entirely by the market - supply and demand. Differences in exchange rates mostly reflect differing costs in moving fiat currencies into or out exchanges, perceived risks of an exchange platform, time/delay risk and fees. 
For one exchange to match another there needs to be arbitrage or "makers" who will buy on one and sell on the other. When one platform takes a long time to withdraw from, or has high bank fees, that makes it less attractive, slower, less profitable to re-balance between them. Some exchanges may be less trusted and that also is reflected in pricing. There is also, of course, speculation and some manipulation as always. Sometimes it just comes down to demand, or lack of, in one nation by users who do not have easy access to other exchanges. 
It doesn't stay constant either. Some days one currency is more favorable than another and others times it may reverse. It's no wonder Bitcoin is volatile and there are many opportunities for trading it.
Also, price varies according to convenience and anonymity, eg. Bitcoin ATMs and LocalBitcoins tend to have a premium for that.

Hardware wallets are really just paper wallets with better convenience and reliablity for signing transactions. Paper wallets have issues related to spending that hardware wallets fix but hardware wallets always have paper backups. They have to because otherwise it's too easy to lose one or have it stolen.
If you need a cheaper hardware wallet then Electrum offline signing is an option that gets close to the same security while still having paper backup and convenient spending.

Note that you can generate a seed offline (a computer that will never again connect to the internet before being wiped clean) and copy the "xpub" (master public key) to an online computer for safe use with Electrum (or others that support "watch-only").
This allows you to have a paper seed and still manage, track and receive pmts on your desktop with no risk of btc being stolen. Transactions cannot be signed with only an xpub. Only when you need to create a tx someday will you need to deal with restoring the seed to sign the tx. Research "offline signing" and "watch-only" wallets.
This is essntially what a hw wallet does anyway. It keeps the seed (prv keys) safe but allows the desktop software to use the xpub to manage the wallet. When the dongle is not plugged in you have a "watch-only" wallet.

Use the right click menu on a transaction to view it on a block explorer and verify it's status. I've noticed that sometimes Electrum doesn't sync fully. I've had times when it was confirmed and even hours later the history list still didn't show that.
If the block explorer shows no confirmation then you have an issue with fees. If your wallet has many tiny incoming payments you may be underestimating the fee needed due to large outgoing tx sizes.

Some did. The ones who held on to their btc. But by large most miners sold as they mined. I mined for years but sold most of my btc monthly before 2013 and got &lt; $10/btc. There was a time I was selling them at $2-3 each. And before that others would have sold for &lt; $1 each. But sure, some probably held on and still do at this price because they believe one day they won't need to sell - everyone will be using them.

Good you found it on a block explorer. 
If you spend about 0.001 (0.73 US$) from balance on 1KN8T3RPWxoSsFrkr6x83KGGof3JNEw4J5 in your wallet **as fees** in a new tx to another address in your wallet then it will pay for your other unconfirmed txs pending and they will get picked up quickly because of CPFP - probably within a few blocks.
Looking at your tx history - the reason you are having a hard time is because you keep using the same address for chained txs. This means if one of the chained txs is dropped all the successive ones fail. Seems like maybe a paper wallet and you keep sending change back to it. That will not do well when txs are backlogged.
Looking again - you would have to choose the right unspent output above to fix it. Too many circular txs.

A reusable payment code is a combination of xpub (seed) based addresses and key exchange (Diffie-Hellman typically). You can do bidirectional pmts by doing a key exchange with a vendor to generate a private address chain such that only the two parties know what addresses are involved, and they are not associated in any way with other addresses. So a vendor could publicly publish a code that can be used for payments without at the same time exposing their pmt history since the actual addresses used are based on private values from each customer.

If your key is encrypted then presumably it's BIP38 format. I don't know about breadwallet but I think Mycelium handles BIP38. 
If breadwallet says it's an encrypted key then yes you would need to know a password too. Both types of private keys are possible. Non-encrypted start with 5 or L but BIP38 encrypted ones start with 6. If you have a paper wallet with a 6xxx key then it was created with a password and BIP38 is very, very hard (pretty much impossible) to brute force.
You don't need the address though as it can be derived from the key.
BTW bitaddress.org can create both type keys, normal or encrypted. I think it is just a check box or pwd entry field to choose which.

You should absolutely use your own node. If you want to save time then look at running a local API on top of your node eg. Insight API. 
I wrote an [API layer in Python]( that's open source and it's not much work at all. Mine isn't much tested yet (so not robust, but you're welcome to build on it); it only took a few days (and then I got distracted by paying work).
Running an exchange immediately makes you a target for hackers. They will quickly find out what weaknesses you have. Using an API is a big weakness as they can circumvent or corrupt your API access. 
If you think you will throw together an exchange in a couple weeks then you're mistaken. But please let us know the name so we can avoid losing funds there. Look back at Bitcoin history and it's abundance of hacks and learn from that.

Bitcoin uses "elliptic curve" (EC) math for signing transactions. A private is only a very large random number (with some restrictions). A public key is calculated from the private key with a "point multiply" (special way of doing multiply). In Bitcoin the public key is used (via more math) to create the address you share publicly. The private is used (via more math) to sign a transaction (add signature data) in a way that can be verified (proven) with the public key and thus address. 
In most current wallets a seed value (encoded as words for human use) is used as a generator for creating a sequence of random numbers (private keys). This process can be repeated at any time consistently getting the same values (deterministic). As such your wallet can use a given set of words to repeatedly generate the same set of private keys, public keys, and addresses. The addresses are looked up on the blockchain to get a full history of transactions.

Difficulty doesn't matter and doesn't "accumulate". It can go up *and down*.
You mean "work", or more accurately "chainwork".
But even so, during a fork there is no *selection* as such. They both exist and continue as long as being used. The one that most nodes doing real transactions use  is the one that matters (to those users doing transactions). No matter how annoying the fact is the other chain exists, to the extent it is being mined on and used. 
Around here we all wish BCH would die off but some twat(s) still keep using it (for show anyway).

SegWit still looks like a 1MB block to old nodes because the signature (witness) data is moved outside the "block". The block has been kept structured such that old nodes won't notice but cannot verify signatures for p2sh tx types, because they are hangin outside. This is why the number of txs that fit in 1 MB is variable - it depends on the mix of p2sh txs. 
So old nodes think they have 1MB blocks but are ignoring the signatures of p2sh txs. SegWit aware nodes will know about that and they can verify both p2pk and p2sh signatures. 
The mix has recently been re-estimated that with current levels of p2sh usage we would get the same tx count as 2.1 MB blocks. But realize this is split into a 1MB compatible block and an extra sig-block that only new nodes can fully verify.

I don't know specifically about your issue. I'll suggest something that may help as a workaround to avoid having to re-sync the entire blockchain. 
I would either move the hd to another (faster) system (or attach a second one) and copy the **blocks directory only** to a different location (under a new blank bitcoin parent directory). Then start bitcoin with a datadir option pointing to that new location. It should revalidate the full chain and build a new chainstate. When querying this new temporary bitcoind with bitcoin-cli you need to pass same datadir option.
If that succeeds and is up to date then remove the original bitcoin folder and replace it with this new one, and copy/move back to raspi. I'm suggesting doing this on a faster system because even validating again will be slow on a raspi. 
Something I've learned to do over the years is periodically making a backup of the bitcoin or blocks directory on alternate media. It has saved me much time now and then. By using **only** the blocks directory you are discarding and rebuilding the chainstate data, which possibly has been corrupted. The blocks are much less likely to be corrupted as they are simply sequential logs of downloaded blocks written once only.

The method I use for re-spending is a few simple edits in the wallet file.
1. Backup wallet file. Always have your seed words written down but it's quicker to restore a backup wallet file.
2. Close Electrum. Find and open the wallet file. 
3. Look for the last tx in the **verified_tx3** section. Note it's first few digits so you can recognize it. 
4. Now look in the **transactions, txi and txo** sections and remove the records that follow this noted one being careful to get the trailing comma on the previous one so the JSON syntax isn't broken. That should clean up the unconfirmed tx. 
5. Save the file and disconnect network so it cannot sync to update again.
6. Open Electrum and check the unconfirmed tx is not shown.
7. Create the tx you want again with higher fee and save to disk. 
8. Optional: Sign offline (or online) and save to disk. 
9. Reconnect network and load the tx from file. It will let you send but probably gets a spent outputs error. 
10. To send using a pushtx page: You can open the saved tx file and select the hex raw tx digits (without quotes) for pasting into a push site. All the sites I've tried have also given spent outputs error. The old tx needs to be dropped from the mempool on the pushtx site and at least some miners for it to get confirmed.
Once you reconnect the sync will update with the unconfirmed tx again but if you do manage a successful re-spend then eventually it will drop the invalid old one and show the new one confirmed. 
Hope that helps.
@_date: 2016-12-02 05:14:22

In which case you should look at [Tails OS]( for Tor use and it has Electrum included. It's a bit older version but still good. It's just missing a few new and nice features. Most important thing in this case is to write down and safely store (in multiple places) your seed words when you create the wallet. Tails will wipe your wallet after you shutdown so without it written on paper you will lose any btc in the wallet.
You should also be aware Bitcoin is not anonymous. It is possible to track where bitcoins move if you are not careful. Never re-use addresses and be careful about re-spending "change" mixed with other funds. Be careful where you buy bitcoin as places like Coinbase are known to watch usage.

An ATM is just what it sounds like. A machine (eg. in a mall or coffee shop) that takes cash in and pays btc out to an address you provide. Easy, convenient but also a bit above market prices.
A flexepin voucher is just some bit of paper printed out at a convenience store cash register eg. 7-11 receipt, that has a code that you can enter in a web site as payment confirmation. They're used for many things and btc is only one item you can buy with them. It's good for low values because they have limits and besides who wants to pay such fees on high amounts. For high dollar amounts you're best to go the full route of ID verification on a real exchange because they offer proper market trading bid/ask prices.
Bitcoin is traded world wide by dozens of exchanges / web sites. So naturally there is a lot of variance in methods, users bases, reliability, rates etc. You can wire money to an account in Ukraine and buy there if you want but I'd suggest you are probably better off to start locally at home and get familiar with how btc works.

I'm not familiar with BitWallet. Most phone wallets don't provide info about outputs but if you can tell that some btc were sent back to an address in your wallet then you would need to spend from that address. Again, most phone wallets don't allow much control over choosing addresses to spend from. There are two ways around this I can think of. 
The first is to spend the full balance of your wallet to a new address in your wallet. This ensures it uses the change output in the new tx but has the downside that if you have many unspent outputs in the wallet the tx size could be quite big and need a higher fee.
The second is to restore your wallet seed (assuming BIP39) into Electrum (desktop wallet not phone) having better control there - it allows viewing details and choosing the address to spend from. That would allow making a possibly smaller tx with lower fee.
Right now according to [this site]( you should pay about 80sat/byte for a fast confirm. At 436 bytes this would be 0.320 mbtc or 0.25 US$. But if you use CPFP then you should probably double that to pay for both txs. If you paid 0.00006269  that's 14 sat/byte - far too little.
@_date: 2016-12-15 13:49:02
It would depend how you arrange things. In my case I need 2 signors to send a tx. So I plug in my HW.1, open Electrum, enter the pin and create my tx as usual. In the case of multisig the HW.1 (and Nano) do not require confirmation, so the tx now has one signature. 
Since my second signor is offline (which need not be the case such as when you use another system or eg. a partner in business) what I then do is click Save to store the partially signed tx to a usb stick.
Then I disconnect from the net, reboot on to my offline usb stick and start Electrum. In Electrum I select Tools, Load Transaction and choose the tx I saved. I click Sign, enter a password for this wallet, and click Save again to save the final fully signed tx back to usb stick. I pull the usb stick, shutdown, reconnect and boot normally to my desktop. Last, I start Electrum, once again choose Tools, Load Transaction and click Broadcast. Done.
Sounds like a lot but it actually takes about 2-3 minutes in total. And I only do that for cold storage.
The HW.1 also can be used as a normal (non-multisig) at the same time. So in that case you just confirm the signing and click Broadcast. With this setup I can use the HW.1 as a daily wallet that's more secure than a password based one, and also as a offline multisig wallet that's more secure than just a single usb stick method.

I've been over it many times and still have to gloss over parts or it fries my brain. When I started above I was trying to keep it really simple. After going back I realized I'd forgotten all about using 2of2 multisig funding / commitment txs. And it goes on for pages covering various combinations.
Near the end it does make note of your concerns. Section 9, says cold storage is feasible for end users, 9.4 and 9.5 about data loss. Bottom line seems to be there has to be some form of backup storage for state. They mention mitigating "forgetting to broadcast in time" with OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY. I don't know how that works. 
It kind of reminds me of how Electrum used to backup labels on a server so when a wallet was restored you could get all that descriptive info back which a seed could not save. I expect something like that will have to be built into wallets but it should be a small amount of state data to know the close tx and it can be encrypted using a key derived from the seed.

Maybe you did something tricky like wrote them in reverse in case someone found them? I don't have any more ideas. If the seed words don't work then you'd have to deal with support. They won't be able to recover the seed but may help getting into the existing wallet.

Hard to figure out what you mean but it sounds like your problem is you didn't backup a wallet and then deleted it ("reset blockchain"), ie. just user error. Always make backups of wallets. 
But perhaps you mean that you are re-syncing the blockchain - in which case you won't see your existing wallet funds until it has sync'd to the block where you first sent money to it. So, then you just need to wait for it sync again.
By "variable address" do you mean that you can have many addresses for receiving? Since having many addresses is not anonymous it follows that having one address is not either. Bitcoin is not anonymous; despite what you may read in the media.
@_date: 2016-11-23 09:25:08
The easy way is to just wait. If you're concerned about time, or about not being able to get it re-sent if it were to be dropped completely, then it's worth doing CPFP. 
What wallet are you using?
CPFP just means spending some part of the unconfirmed tx with a higher fee in order to "boost" it. Some wallets make it easy and some not. In this case you would send the unconfirmed output to another address in your wallet and include a fee covering both the old and new tx size. So at, say, 100 sat/byte x 400 bytes (both old and new size) = 0.4 mbtc ~ 0.30 US$ it would likely confirm in a few blocks.
edit: 80sat/byte = 0.3 mbtc ~ 0.23 US$ may be adequate now. Seems main glut is passed by. Otherwise 31 sat/byte still looks like a hundred blocks now.

LN funds are NOT off chain. And they are not in anyones custody but your own. The only down side is that the funds are time locked - that is, you cannot spend them elsewhere until the time lock expires. How long? You choose a suitable time.
Maybe you should understand how it works before being critical.
Actually I think once this is up and working many people are going to want to lock funds in LN because it offers better privacy, faster speed and lower cost. 
But beyond that it could be a boon to the dark markets. Potentially it will be safe to lock funds in dark channels that could be used on many underground sites without fear of loss, exit scams, and site take downs. In fact, a dark market site being taken down with locked funds may result in a full refund if LE cannot settle in time.

You need Electrum 2.7 or newer. Select Tools, Preferences. Check box "Enable Replace By Fee". Now on the Send screen there is a checkbox for "Replaceable".
RBF - Replace By Fee - when a tx is marked as replaceable it means after sent you can update the tx fee to a higher value to expedite the tx. You can do this from the unconfirmed tx context menu (right click).
Also, it occurred to me with your original question you can preview the tx now in recent versions as there is a Preview button. It should tell you exactly the actual fee it will include and then you can click "Sign". However, on the down side it doesn't tell you the sat/byte value - which would be a convenient and welcome bit of info. (I've added a feature request for this now.)

The xpub is only needed for a watch-only wallet. That is a wallet that does not allow spending. If you created a wallet from your seed words then it is able to spend and will already have all the functions of the watch-only wallet plus the ability to spend.
If you created a wallet from your backup seed words then it should show all addresses and transactions that occurred in the blockchain.info wallet. If the balance is now zero then that would mean a transaction occurred that spent funds. Do you see that and did it happen today (or recently)?
Reading your other replies here it sounds like at some point today you may have entered your 12 word seed into a page requesting that info. I'm unclear if you did but if that is the case then it may have been a phishing page (an email link that sent you to a website that mimics the real one but is fraudulent) and in that case I'm sure your funds were stolen by whoever sent that email to you. As far as I know blockchain.info will never send you an email sending you to a page to enter your seed words. At least they should never do that. 
This is one of the serious problems with blockchain.info (and any web based wallet). It is too easy to fall for fake websites when you are not expert at knowing what to look for. 
I'm hoping this did not happen to you. If your Electrum wallet shows your real history and that ends with a transaction you didn't make that clears the balance out then that is likely why. If your wallet just shows no transactions or history and that is why it is zero balance, then most likely there was a mistake in the steps to create the wallet and does not indicate a theft. I'll wait for you to check and reply as to whether I can help further.

There's a good chance you may make more return over the long run with Bitcoin rather than stocks. As long as you can afford to lose it you'd be better adding $10/month to your bitcoin wallet.
No, not web wallet. Setup and learn to use Electrum as "offline signing cold storage". Tutorials are around. For small amounts an offline wallet is mostly to deter you from spending or selling at random crashes that happen often enough. Electrum offline can be done with only a USB stick (booting on Tails or other Linux when net unplugged).

You can bump the tx by spending one of it's outputs. If you sent to someone else then you probably have a change output back to your wallet. So on Mycelium, since you cannot control input selection, you would need to spend the entire balance to your next receive address, and pay a higher fee - enough to cover both the stuck tx and this new one. 
So it is doable, but it may be cheaper, and easier to do on Electrum. If you are not too worried about malware on your desktop then you can install Electrum and restore your Mycelium seed to that. 
Then you'd check your stuck tx in the history list, right click, details and determine the change output. Go to the address list (ctrl-A) and spend from only that address (right click it and Send From), to any address you own. That makes the spend as small and cheap as possible, something hard to do in Mycelium (depending on how many past txs you've received in Mycelium there could be many unspent outputs making for a pretty big tx size).
What I just described above is a CPFP - Child Pays For Parent tx. You can do that in Mycelium or Electrum but since Mycelium doesn't have selection of single outputs to spend the only way is to spend the entire balance.
@_date: 2016-12-18 15:02:05
Electrum does support BIP39 restore but it does not create new seeds that are BIP39 compatible. You can restore Mycelium seeds and xprvs in Electrum. I have tested it myself to be sure. When you choose Restore there is an options button and you can select BIP39 there. It also supports "extra words", or passphrase extension for BIP39, and you can choose any account number in the derivation as well, which gives it a lot of flexibility. 
I have also tested restore of seeds and xpubs from [this useful tool]( which can be used offline to generate a BIP39 wallet. And it can be used to check Mycelium wallet accounts.

I guess a distro with fewer packages is good but I don't think it's going to make much difference. Maybe something like Tails which has more auditing and selective pruning of unnecessary packages. Many people like that choice but you'd need to install the most recent Electrum as it comes with an old version.
Yes. If you just install after cloning you'll get the development code as per changes made since release. So you should do a checkout of last release before doing the install. eg. `git checkout 3.3.8` You can see tagged releases on the repo "releases" page or by doing `git tag --list`. Anyway, 3.3.8 is current one. You can also use the tgz file and unarchive it and do the install steps but the thing about cloning is you are getting what is in the repo instead and anything possibly changed during packaging. I've been suing the dev version for years.

I didn't and wouldn't suggest he rebuild on the pi. He may as well just start fresh in that case. If the chainstate is corrupted then I haven't seen posted any other way to fix it.
I've never had issues with rsync myself but I have never used it with Windows. afaik it does crc checks while copying by default. I've mostly used rsync either on same system (backup) or only across my gigabit lan between linux systems. 
edit - googled and read up. It seems rsync does use md5 to check files during transfer but depends on OS for  write level error checking. It does not read back after writing.
I keep a backup as a matter of policy but nowadays my node is on a ZFS filesystem with built in redundancy. In the last 18 months I have never had an issue. ZFS is set to scrub the data once a month. That does a full binary data check and reports any bit rot. On these 4x3GB HGST Ultrastor drives not a single bit bad in that time (knock on wood).

Technically you could start with someone else's 250GB `./blocks` directory and the node would revalidate it and build a new chainstate. But yes, if you start with a pruned data set you cannot rebuild (except by starting over) and must trust the source. 
Given a full (250GB) blocks folder you can re-validate and then prune to a smaller size.

It's permissionless, though a LN node need not deal with you, and btc locked in a channel cannot be stolen because both counterparties always have on-chain txs that can be broadcast to settle. Also, the current 5 LN implementations have made plans for standardizing the protocol so hopefully will be compatible. The sixth implementation (Thunder by blockchain.info) I'm unsure about since they were not involved with the meetup but they have a github with code as well.

Only on average of course, ie. for longer time spans. If used for short term prediction it could be far off not only due to variance but also because miners can potentially be quite far off "network" time as well. Going by vague memory I think the code allows something like a 2 hour window for acceptable time mismatch.

A micro sd card is one of those tiny memory cards that can be put in phones or other small devices. They are simply storage like a usb memory stick except they generally need a small SD card adapter to plug into laptops, or maybe a usb adapter for a desktop system.
It's possible there is some data on one of those cards laying around, hidden or in a desk drawer, or safety deposit box. It may be encrypted (requires a password to open and read), or it may simply be a text file containing a list of words. Most bitcoin wallets nowadays consist of a list of 12 or 24 words. But not all - some people use other methods to store the important "keys" for their wallet. 
The first step would be trying to locate and figure out what you have. If you can do that you can post here for follow up but do not give actual data (words/text) to anyone. Once you know what you actually have you may be able to get more detail on how to deal with it.
Unfortunately if he did not leave instructions for access it may be impossible. There are just so many variations on how to store bitcoin. But start by collecting together what you think is relevant and keeping it safe. You may end up needing the help of someone but be absolutely sure it is someone you can trust - your lawyer, estate executor etc. 
There is an online service called "[Dave's Wallet Recovery]( you may try dealing with as he has been around a long time and earned a solid reputation - though he charges a percent fee for recovery. It's probably better to deal with a "trusted" family member who may know about Bitcoin.

SegWit is designed to be compatible with old versions so they can continue to operate but not verify SegWit type txs. But those same old versions do not accept blocks &gt; 1 MB so it's not possible to continue with them in the network if blocks &gt; 1 MB are mined.

You only need to set a fee high enough to compete with other users to get into the next block. Paying more doesn't improve your speed. To get an idea of how many txs are waiting and what fees they're paying you can look at a site like [this]( but a good wallet will estimate a suitable fee based on network state (and tx size in bytes, of course). 
Electrum offers some nice features but the main difference compared to core is downloading the blockchain - time and space. It uses a different HD wallet derivation method so the seeds are not compatible. 
Electrum can restore BIP39 seeds from apps like Mycelium, Copay, and HW wallets like Ledger, Trezor. I don't think it can restore a Core wallet (BIP32) but I may be wrong - never tried it. Core is not compatible with most other wallets either. IMO Electrum is a bit more flexible but Core offers true trustless verification.

You can make a CLTV address without too much hassle using coinb.in. I described the steps [here]( But satoshi didn't have that available back in the day and I don't think he was thinking about how to get a new lambo each year from bitcoin.
I'd suggest if you try using coinb.in you do some test runs first to be sure of the process. It's actually not hard to setup but offers no safety net whereas a better wallet might use script code that allows alternate retrieval options.

You won't get any results for addresses if they are relatively new. That is you first used them in a tx within the last few months (guess) then they won't yet be in the blocks you have sync'd.
If you look at the Electrum tx details (right click) then it says how many cfms. Subtract that from the current block # and if you have not yet sync'd that block on bitcoind then you won't see it.

In the Electrum console window enter:
    wallet.storage.put('gap_limit',100)
You can also edit the wallet file manually but above is the preferred method. Not sure if maybe you need to close and re-open the wallet.
Another way to handle server payments is to add new addresses to a mysql db (which maybe you have for your site already) and then instead of setting a hook on for address you set a hook for new block. When each new block comes in you parse and check each address against your db locally. When the address list is very large this is a more efficient way, doesn't depend on perhaps too many address hooks or having to expire old addresses, and also works well when you run your own node as you can "hook" new blocks directly not depending on another service.

Best option is to update your Electrum. 2.7 has better fee estimation and also very helpful for this is RBF (Replace By Fee) - allows marking a tx as RBF and then later if the fee is too low you can increase the fee a bit and get it confirmed. It should just be a matter of installing the new version again over top. 
If you are using an offline install that is harder to upgrade then an older version can still sign a tx created with a newer version on your desktop.

Not in any accurate universal way.
LN is basically a network of private ledgers containing un-broadcast btc txs. When a settling tx is broadcast it may represent any number of aggregated LN pmts between any number of end users and/or nodes. Only the parties to those pmts would know how many and for what amounts. Many of the LN pmts will be between LN nodes as intermediaries, ie. internal to the network for relaying of pmts. So even if self-reported a meaningful total would be unknowable.

From what I've heard the exchanges in India are limited to only dealing with btc from customers within India. So they are pretty much playing within a limited supply there. They can't buy btc from outside India without breaking capital control laws. So that probably means the flow from their customers is limited by remittances as wages/trade, and obviously there is much more demand than that input can supply. Someone who can export goods or labour from India and get paid in btc currently can do very well.

Electrum allows spending from an address. Go to address list, find address and right click it, choose "Spend From" (it has to have an unused output for that to be available).

There is a risk profile difference though as I mention in my other post about Thailand it's very unlikely locals will know about it and I never felt unsafe because of btc. 
The risk difference is that with a normal debit card the bank will limit the daily amount that can be taken. With btc if someone knows and understands it then they know they can force the info from you that will allow a full sweep of all btc you have. 
To offset that I'd suggest splitting large amounts into daily, short term and long term using 2 extra passphrases on a BIP39/hw wallet. But as I said, unless you go blabbing your mouth off about how rich you are or other obvious displays of wealth, it's unlikely in most places that locals will have any idea that btc means you are a ripe target.

I'm not sure as I haven't tried sending from two wallets in sequence. You can certainly have several wallets open at once and then send from one of them. I've done that a few times. 
It only talks to the hw wallet for signing a tx but I'm not sure if it can reset that session and then a second wallet can start a new session. You don't need the hw wallet for just opening and using a wallet. You can create a tx right up to the point of signing (or save it for later) and then plug in and the last step needs the dongle.

Maybe you know this but Electrum supports using watch-only on servers to receive pmts in the same setup you have. That works the same except doesn't store the seed or keys on the server - which is much safer. You just restore the wallet using MPK (xpub) instead of seed - otherwise no difference except cannot send tx from that wallet. If your server is compromised you will lose btc regardless of encryption and/or password because they can replace Electrum source code to mimic normal operation but spend to their address.
Also install Electrum on your laptop and restore from seed and then it instantly shows all tx on your server as they happen and you can spend without needing to sweep at all. You can even do this offline for max security if you like. Install a watch only on your laptop (like server) for monitoring and creating txs. Then moves unsigned txs to an offline system for signing. 
Just more options... but unless you are dealing in small amounts you don't worry about losing I'd get that seed off the public server. Anyone gaining root access can steal the btc there.
If you really need to use vanity addresses then at least only copy the addresses and not keys to the server. You can just add them in advance to Electrum on your laptop. ie. batch vanitygen on laptop, add keys to Electrum, copy addresses to server.

That may be nifty - like the tx details pop up, but more info on cfm status and an expedite button at bottom.
Maybe it can check if it's in the server's mempool as that would prevent re-spending. Also, don't think worth estimating over 72 hours as that's apparently the default drop time. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:01:36
It looks like you already tried a double spend. That was not the right way to fix this. You should have used a CPFP (Child Pays For Parent) tx to expedite it. The problem with double spends is most nodes and miners will reject them. It's showing on blockchain.info so presumably it was relayed by some nodes but that doesn't mean it will get mined. There is a much higher likelihood with CPFP.
edit - and you only doubled the fee to 0.2mbtc? Why bother.

I can tell you about my experiences in Thailand. It used to be easy to sell btc on a web site and go to a normal atm and enter a code to get cash. They shut that option down a few years ago. Then I could only sell online and have it go to a Thai citizens bank account. That was ok as my gf let me sell into hers and I could just go take it out of an atm. Easy. I did that for a couple years and when I left it still worked. Apparently there was a way to sell online and pick up cash at a bank branch by showing your passport. I never tried that. I never had any hassles with bitcoin as far as being a target because almost no one knows what it is or understands how they might target you. Don't blab a lot and no one will know you have any. The bank pickup method sounds ok since you aren't exposed outside. I've heard of foreigners being robbed at atms but that was just normal debit card withdrawls anyway. On the whole I found BTC easy to use in Thailand from 2013 to 2018 and never felt unsafe. I mined btc while there as well for several years but that's way back, 2011-2014.
Now a year in Australia and there is BTM machines around but I have not tried using them. I just sell online to my sister's account and she gets it out of an atm for me. It's not large amounts anyway - few hundred $ now and then. I suppose if you know locals you could do that anywhere that's not so draconian as the US.

In the recent interview I think Sunny Ray said they were working on an exchange. I don't know when that's supposed to open. I also don't know for sure if there is a real exchange in India. I'm only talking above in general terms of what you can do on other exchanges. On an exchange you have fiat and btc balances and can place orders for whatever price you want it to fill at. So they have an order book. With a broker you have one price available and you take it or leave it. You may not have account balances as the trade may settle directly to your bank (which I guess is how Unocoin works).

It's 95% of blocks in a 2016 block adjustment period. So it would need to be enough new hash power until enough blocks (1916) are found in that period. There is also variance so even with 92% hash power that may be enough, though I haven't calculated if variance could reach that much over so many blocks. I'm sure someone has figured it out and will post.

At that price, depending on your kwh rate, you may want to get a raspberry pi 3 (or 4) to run your node. My calcs at $0.08/kwh are it would use ~$6/year. (10W * 24*365 * $0.08 CAD). 
Of course, if you leave the system on for other reasons then be honest and share the cost of node operation. Mine doubles as my kodi media center, home file server so would be on 24/7 anyway.

If there is dev support I am more inclined to this than putting up with current miner control shenanigans. Look at this shit going on with mempool attacks and miners jumping between chains. It's already destroying Bitcoin and it's just a matter of time before the market realizes it. I'd prefer to see the price fall than miners acting as proxies for state control and a lobotomized Bitcoin; it's already looking like the walking dead, and I absolutely will not be using some crap coin that defeats the core tenets of decentralization.
I've been in this 6 years and done some past serious dev work on ASIC mining boards and firmware. I'd love to work on cuckoo hash FPGA implementations but I'm not going to put effort in that unless there is more widespread support. Nonetheless, I'm ready for a reboot when it happens. If that sounds like nonsense then I'd question why you are involved in Bitcoin.

That's one way to make the seed without depending on the RNG in the Trezor. Roll dice, make seed, restore in Trezor but you'll need to use wallet software to do that. I prefer Electrum over using the online wallet.trezor.io wallet. You make up your own passphrase while restoring the seed and the passphrase is not stored in the Trezor (well, if you trust the software then it's not).
Most people don't roll dice but if you don't want to be open to any potential bad seed generating "issue" then that's one way to do it. The problem with this is that diceware only supports 12 word seeds and I prefer a 24 word one (though technically 12 is more than strong enough). You can use diceware to create 24 words but the last word will be invalid - unlike a 12 word seed with 16 possible valid ones to try, there are 256 to try for a 24 word seed. So usually you need to use some offline system to calc the last word or try many more last words - a nuisance because ideally you don't want to go to the bother and if setting up an offline system you can skip using the Trezor altogether. I wrote a post months ago about how to do it. No easy answer except use a 12 word seed.

You should use Electrum. It supports "pay to many" txs. You can either simply paste in several addresses and the btc for each, comma separated, or load from file. Plus it has an api/command line interface so you can actually script how you want it to work potentially making auto-split not too hard.  It also supports multisig if you want to do that and works with most hardware wallets directly giving you better security.

Impossible to say accurately. We only have on-chain tx records and some part of that is churning between same owner addresses. You could go by exchange volume but that's off-chain - and exchanges without fees can have arbitrary volume. If you go by blockchain.info charts (at todays tx volume) then roughly $66 billion btc is "moved" each year.
@_date: 2016-11-24 12:56:24
Sorry to hear that. If the tx is dropped it will revert to your wallet. If it ends up in the marketplace wallet you should be able to get it back or be credited with it.
If you believe they will not treat it like your btc (ie. steal it), then you can make a last ditch effort to double spend it with a higher fee. Miners will drop the first tx if they see a second one paying a higher fee using the same inputs. The problem is that the double spend may (likely) not be accepted by the network and relayed to any miners. It is worth trying if you are sure the btc will be stolen upon late arrival.
You can do a double spend in Electrum but it is a hack requiring a few wallet file edits and then creating a new tx with higher fee and pushing it through other nodes/servers.

It's probably going to take a bit of reading to wrap your head around Bitcoin. It's not a product in the normal sense of Starbucks with a Starbucks cards or a company that runs it. 
Bitcoin is like cash for the internet. And like cash people can use it without any third party between themselves and who they are trading with. So users can spend bitcoin at your business without involving any entity besides you and them. Some businesses may choose to use an intermediary to make it easier, like Bitpay (not the only one), but you'll find that for gambling most of these intermediaries have restrictions according to the laws wherever they operate. 
If you choose to use Bitpay to make your website integration easier you would follow their T&amp;C available on their web site. But that is a choice. You can add software to your web site that allows users to pay you directly into your own wallet without any such helper company and without any T&amp;C. It is simply software that talks to other software using a protocol.
For gambling you are likely going to need a programmer to integrate Bitcoin software into your existing payment handling. And once you do that you don't have any T&amp;C to follow other than any laws you are subject to. If you want to convert Bitcoin to another currency you would have to work that out yourself and may need to work with exchanges that may be fussy about where bitcoin came from in the same way a bank may ask. Bitcoin itself doesn't care - it's just software.

Online storage of an encrypted file it's only as good as your password. Use at least 20 random chars to be safe. But then you have to write that down on paper anyway. Using a BIP38 encrypted key is preferred due to it's hardening and you can get away with shorter easier to recall passwords in that case. This would be best choice if you don't want to write down the password.
But my overall preference would be a HD wallet seed. If you have to write down something then a seed word list is best as from that you can maintain a watch only wallet online safely. Also, a Ledger HW.1 is only about $15 and takes this one step further with full usability.

You can do that. I doubt it would affect tracking at all. You just make a transaction with multiple outputs each one being to an address in your wallet. Not all wallets have that ability but Electurm does.
If the amount on each address is small then you'll end up combining them to make a payment anyway. Doing that will tie the addresses together as being in one wallet again. Even if the amounts are larger you will create change amounts in the wallet which later will be re-associated when used as inputs. Unless very careful you will eventually re-associate most of the addresses again.

mpk  = master public key, also called xpub. This is derived from the seed and allows generating all addresses (derived from public keys) but not private keys. Exposing the mpk is a privacy risk (whoever has that can see all your addresses, balances, and txs) but not a risk of losing btc (cannot sign txs). However, exposing the mpk along with one private key can allow calculating other private keys.

A hardware wallet is like a dedicated system HD wallet. You still write down the seed words and safely store them. If the hardware is lost, stolen or breaks then you use the seed words to create a new wallet and move the btc. 
The main advantage of a hardware wallet over a paper wallet is usability. A paper wallet is not very good for making transactions and ideally should only be used once in a sweep operation. A hardware wallet allows keeping btc offline **and** still allows quick and easy spending.

I'll have a go: 
A blockchain is a distributed data structure consisting of cryptographically signed data records arranged as blocks in a chain such that each block also includes a hash of the block it follows thereby creating provable ordering and immutability. 
Bitcoin is the prototypical blockchain but many copies and variants have followed. Of critical importance is the software rules that define how blocks are added, who can add blocks and what data is actually in each block - a blockchain in itself does not create anything secure or immutable if the controls around it's operation are weak. 
Blockchain has now become a buzzword meant to signify some secure new way of storing data but whether that has any significant meaning depends entirely on the implementation details.

IMO if you're going to go multisig (which I did for a couple years) there's little reason to also use hw wallets. Storing a seed on paper/metal in multiple locations is about the same security. Signing on several different systems protects you against any viable malware threat. You can use a mixed combo as well, eg. 1 hw, and 2 paper seed or desktop/mobile wallets. I wouldn't trust only flash memory for long term seed storage even in a 2 of 3 situation.

I have a Trezor One and it's completely fine for your expected uses. I think it's physically a little smaller too. So it's a bit easier to hide if you want. I'd also suggest using a passphrase (have to enable), and "advanced" mode when testing or recovering a seed.

Electrum encodes the seed type into the words and the xprv/xpub so you can't create a mutlisig from normal seeds even though technically this should be possible. If you want to mess around you may be able to re-encode the prefix in an xprv/xpub and it may be possible but there is really little point as you will still need to move any btc to a new address anyway. 
Electrum does support using BIP39 seeds/xprv/xpub as multisig signors so if you have that you should be able to add it to create a multisig wallet. Just choose "I have a master key" instead of "Create a new seed" at that step. This is what allows using hw wallets for signors. It has no support for single key ("import") wallets being combined as multisig.
For passphrase: When creating the wallet click the "Options" button on seed word screen and check the "use custom words" option. This is the same as passphrase. Note, if using an xprv/xpub the passphrase has already been used to create the master keys so it is not used in addition.
Bitcoin core wallet can do multisig from single keys but only from console/rpc. I think you can also use  but I'd suggest copying the web page offline for that. It only uses pubkeys for the address but to sign a tx you'd need multiple privkeys and I've never tried that with their interface - so, test first.
@_date: 2019-10-11 01:19:06
You can create an "import" wallet in Electrum with any address. Just choose File, New. Standard wallet. I have a public/private key. And it will create a wallet for you that tracks any address/key in it. No one can spend without the key so if you paste addresses in then they are watch-only.
Coinbase uses internal addresses and moves btc from your deposit address to their own addresses. You can't depend on any balance on that address - your balance is what their database says you have as they are custodians. Move them to your own address generated from your own key if you want to have real btc you can control at any time. Otherwise it's up to them if and when they let you sell or withdraw the btc.

In Bitcoin history every time the price rises strongly an exchange gets hacked causing a crash. It's traumatic for all those holding their btc on the exchange, plus they need to hear a hundred times over how they should have done what everyone said and moved the btc to their own wallet.

I agree with most of your comments except maybe we can't know that it won't be less safe. That depends on how it's done. For glitching I would think that maybe on-die capacitors could prevent strange power behavior and that's something perhaps STM could do (well, I'm no expert on that). But if it means switching cpu to another mfr / model then who knows if it's easier or harder, and attackers may find similar issues.
I don't know how much info the wallet.fail guys made public. I recall it took them ~3 months to figure out the right timing parameters, method and iirc they used a readily available fpga dev kit (Arty7, one I happen to own). It's the kind of thing someone in organized crime could probably set up and then use for targeted thefts but not something your average joe will set up and be able to do in a few days poking around after they find one.
I don't have so much at stake that I'd buy a new one for this threat. My daily/decoy wallet only has ~$20 typically.
@_date: 2019-10-04 23:17:15
Timing isn't really an issue if the firmware replaced a change address. It was already lost when he did his last tx and it just sat there until the hacker detected it and moved it. Though I doubt this how hacked as he made several txs and if the fw was compromised this would imply he couldn't spend from his first change address.
It seems to me this may be an unsophisticated local seed compromise. The hint is the hacker probably isn't auto-monitoring the seed. New deposit late at night and didn't know there was substantial btc in the wallet. When seen in the morning what btc remained was moved. If it had been more sophisticated then likely it would have been monitored by a script and taken the full 5.x btc immediately upon deposit (even before cfms).
Given that a unsigned fw update should have wiped the seed it's more likely someone local discovered the seed. I'm not sure the fw can't be checked by usb port but it should be readable via JTAG by trezor or someone with suitable hw tools/knowledge.

Initial steps:
1. What OS is the system running? Linux, Windows? This determines how to check the system and where to look for files.
2. Was full disk encryption used? You probably cannot tell without decent tech skills. If you power off the system with full disk encryption and cannot find the password you likely will never get access to the files ever. If he used this you will need to gain login access before power off in order to look for files. There is no real reason to use encryption on a mining rig but he may have had other reasons for wanting it encrypted.
3. In many/most cases the mining system is not the wallet used to keep funds. Most miners will mine for a pool and that pool pays out to an address in a wallet that could be anywhere. He may have his wallet on his phone. Don't assume there is a wallet on the mining system, though that is possible - it's not very secure, and most miners probably would not keep a wallet on their mining system.
4. Look for wallet software (Electrum, Bitcoin-qt, etc) on his desktop system and his phone. If you can locate that you may have a better idea what to do next. Most of these programs will allow viewing the wallet without password (which they only need for spending usually). This may help with knowing if there is even any funds to bother with. It also will indicate what for the backup wallet or seed may take.
5. If you have access to his regular desktop system (more important than the mining system) then look at his web browser bookmarks or history to find what pool he mined for. Then try to login to that pool. Did he use a password safe? You would need to do a fair bit of detective work to figure out how he worked. Gaining access to the mining system is not necessarily what you need to do.

I guess you're worried about an offline signing embedding keys that is then taken back to an online system. If that's it then I'd suggest decoding the tx using **bitcoin-cli** before taking it online. There was a [post here yesterday]( about using it to [decode signed txs]( Still, realize that whatever you do if not your own code then you trust whatever you use.
An actual raw tx does not have extra fields as may be suggested by the json decoded output. Any key insertion would be instead of required tx data. A tx validator/decoder should detect this mismatch of data since a signed tx has be exactly right to work.
I wrote [sqlchain]( - "a compact sql layer on top the blockchain", which has tx decoding functions to parse tx data and insert in a mysql db. If you are inclined to read python code you could take the tx decoder function and make a simple cmd line tool that decodes and checks data.
Personally I use Electrum with with a trezor and trust that it signs correctly. Paranoia can sometimes go to far and become a big time waster. I've been down that road too. You are more likely to lose btc due to sloppy screw ups than far fetched remotely possible attacks.
**edit** - other posts have correctly pointed out that a key could be used as random input to signing the tx and even using a tx decoder is not going to detect that. I feel very confident my trezor isn't doing that but I guess if I had more at stake it would be wise to use multisig and different signors.

The hw wallet provides the xpub to your web wallet for generating addresses. So if you use the web interface then the xpub is retrieved and used within the code. As long as you never use a fake or hacked version of the web wallet your'e fine but if you accidentally load a hacked version one day or someone puts some code on your system that can communicate with the hw wallet or intercept the web wallet then it may gain your xpub. That would still not be more than a privacy issue if you trust they cannot gain a private key from a used address. If someone gains your xpub and has old re-used address pubkeys then they have incentive to try and crack the private key so they can gain access to other keys in the same address chain.
I'd say it's fairly remote but certainly not impossible. Creating a new seed with a hw wallet is very easy and gives you more clarity as a starting point. You would do a test recovery of your current seed to ensure you can recover. Then wipe the device and create a new seed to get a new wallet address. Probably want to test recover that too. Then recover the old seed and send btc to your new address. Then recover the new seed to go forward with your new wallet. 
Or, as I mentioned just turn on passphrase support and use that new wallet. Keep a bit of btc in the un-passphrased one as canary or "rubber hose" wallet. 
You really should be using a passphrase with a hw wallet anyway for any significant btc amount.

You can use Samourai (if you must) as it supports BIP39. You just have to do it bass-ackwards. Create the wallet on Samourai and then restore the seed on Electrum. When restoring be sure to click the Option button and checkmark "Use BIP39". It supports passphrases too but they call it "extension words".
Just don't store a large amount of btc in either of these "online connected" wallets. If you have a lot the easiest way is using a hw wallet and using Samourai or Electrum as watch-only wallet for that. Otherwise, more complicated but free method is learning how to make an offline Electrum. Any connected wallet is always open to malware threats, mistakes and poor opsec. For small amounts it's not a big deal but be smart if you have a lot.

Your txs have probably been dropped. So btc will remain with the wallet they were sent from. If they aren't there now they should be updated before too long. Not all nodes drop txs at the same time so it's possible to appear gone until sync'd on sending node. I looked the address up and it has no txs on several explorer sites.

You can't use "native" Electrum because Samourai is BIP39. It uses the words in a different way to get the master key. So when restoring in Electrum choose Option button and click BIP39.

A hw wallet is primarily a convenience device. You still have a paper backup and that is the item that needs to be secured. A Trezor is vulnerable to attack by knowledgeable thieves who gain possession but only if you don't use a passphrase. Security conscious users would always have a low value default wallet (no passphrase) and a second (or even third) wallet with passphrase. This helps with deniability and rubber hose attacks in addition to making it much slower (years) for any kind of brute force even if the device itself is stolen. 
Finally,  since you are basically happy with paper but looking for more convenient spending you can still secure your seed word paper backup and wipe the trezor (reset seed). That way if the device is found you cannot lose btc. Restoring the seed when you want to spend is much easier than an typical offline signing process.

The private key is a random number (with some excluded values not allowed) and the public key is the private key multiplied by the generator point.

Yes. As new blocks are added it periodically checks space used and deletes old ones.

No. You spend one of the outputs of the stuck tx. This creates a dependent tx - a tx that depends on the stuck one. Miners will see the dependence and in order to collect the fee for that will include the tx it depends upon. 
If you sent a tx from your wallet to someone else then you cannot spend that output but if there is a change output back to your wallet then you **can** spend that.

An old device will still have keys and is a security weak spot unless you wipe it clean. Same goes for your backup seed word lists. Anything that has the seed words can be used to re-generate the keys and address list to access coins.
Have you not tried Electrum yet? It works great with Trezor and though I don't have a Ledger it is supposed to also work. You can use Electrum alone with connecting to random servers or run your own bitcoin node and electrum-personal-server to be completely independent of any outside service. This is how I use my Trezor and it works great. The only thing is you'd need other software to work with altcoins and I'm not up on whatever may be available.
You say above that you want your btc stored out-of-sight out-of-mind. You don't even need a hw wallet for that. It is only an additional access point focused on convenience. Your seed words are your ultimate backup and store of keys. Keep them safe and you can wipe your hw wallet or reset it and update software. Later when you actually want access you can restore the seed words for access again. A hw wallet is designed mostly for convenient access but ultimately your wallet is the seed words on paper or metal (good for long term, fire safety).

Electrum does support BIP39/44. It just doesn't create a BIP39 wallet by default. It can only restore one given a word list or xprv/xpub. But if you use a HW wallet it will let the HW do the creation and work with it.

LocalBitcoins is completely legitimate and is one of the oldest companies dealing in Bitcoin. 
What you need to be careful about is who you exchange with. When buying your btc will be held in escrow by the site until payment is complete. Generally buying btc is safer than selling because you don't take a risk that later on payment can be reversed. In fact, for the seller you are the risk. Whatever payment form you use it must be something provable to the site for escrow release. 
I've done a dozen or so exchanges there without any problem and they've all been selling btc where I was at risk of later reversals. My main rules are (1) look for long term 100% reputations, and (2) keep the value of each trade low so it's not worth running off with funds, (3) they shouldn't even hint of flaky terms.
Another method I've heard is easy but have never tried is available if you ever travel up to Canada. You can use QuickBT to buy using only a phone # for sms verification. They send you a code and you enter online, and I think you buy vouchers at any of 6000 stores across the country.

Yes. You can do that. 
Ideally you'd want to get the xpub from it too so that you can use that to monitor the wallet. That's what Electrum gets from the Trezor via usb to allow it to manage the wallet even when not connected.
But if you just want a seed you need not buy anything. Just [roll dice]( and make a seed - many users do that for a totally random truly offline seed. The problem is you cannot do much without some software that calcs the xpub and uses it to generate addresses. You can use Electrum, or [iancoleman]( (saved offline for use). 
Assuming you just don't trust using Electrum offline I'd suggest using the BIP39 dice rolled seed, get the xpub with iancoleman (offline) and then plug that xpub into Electrum (on desktop is safe). With Electrum when restoring a BIP39 seed: on the seed page you have to choose the option button and click "BIP39" or it will not recognize the seed). If restoring from xpub then you choose "I have public/private key" when restoring. 
If you are trying to be super safe and not trust any mfr/dev then many users now use multisig with two different seed sources, eg. 1 trezor, 1 electrum or other, etc. That way any single bad entity can't spend btc.
@_date: 2019-08-30 03:45:15
Another thing that occurred to me is you just aren't giving it enough time to rewind and load blocks. It does this at start up and while it's doing that you get the error you see. That is a generic error shown whenever it's busy after start up. I noticed you get to the obfuscation key in debug.log. In mine after the the very next steps is rewinding and verifying blocks. That will be very slow on the pi. You have 6 minutes between shutdown and restart in your log. That is not enough. If you haven't given it a few hours and then queried with cli then try that before anything else.

Electrum's default wallet is different but it supports restoring BIP39. So if you generate the word list elsewhere, eg.  then it works fine. I'd like to see an option for BIP39 creation built in, but I'm not sure ThomasV is open to a pull request for that. 
Incidentally that tool above is useful for exploring the various derivation paths and keys. As you mention not everyone is on the same page, but mostly they're reading the same book at least.

The next best alternative to a HW wallet is an offline Electrum wallet, and the main reason to use it is cost savings.
You make a USB boot dongle, or dedicated offline system, and boot it with no internet connection. You can have internet when installing the OS and Electrum but it never sees it again after that, ever. 
When you boot on that you create your wallet. Save the xpub (master public key) to usb stick for taking to your desktop later, or snap a QR photo to scan later. Write down the seed words on paper, as you would with any HW wallet. Now when you want to sign on this wallet you boot offline load the tx, sign and save it again.
On your desktop Electrum you restore with xpub and get a fully working wallet without ability to sign. You can receive btc and monitor txs. But to spend you create the tx and save to usb stick, then either shutdown and reboot, or go to your dedicated offline system (which could be as cheap as a raspberry pi hooked to your TV), load, sign, save. Bring it back to desktop, load, broadcast. Your seed is never exposed on a system with net access.
I did this for a few years but have a HW wallet now. The time saved is typically 3-4 minutes per tx. I still use this method with multi-sig and HW wallet as signor for deep savings, but HW alone for daily wallet.
@_date: 2016-12-23 02:47:49
You won't be able to see the txs offline so write down the first (or first few) addresses to check. Successful restore will generate the same address list. Another way is take a photo of address list before wiping and compare to one after. Or compare xpub, same starting point for both. Comparing xpub or addresses doesn't even require sending test btc.

 can create one but afaik it's not compatible with other wallets (meaning you need coinb.in to spend from address). Given this I'd suggest anyone trying do a short term test tx first and then create the spend tx now and save for broadcast later. 
btw I did a test tx and it worked fine for me. It just could not be used (spent from) in Electrum so had to be managed separately. 
It would be nice to see a CLTV tx facility in Electrum. I was going to create a plugin for that, and did for creating the address, but could not figure out how to code the spend tx without having to alter a lot of existing code. So it sits half working now.
@_date: 2019-10-20 07:58:13
There is a solution already - it's called a pruned node. The only thing it doesn't help with is bootstrapping new nodes onto the network since they don't store all the blocks. Validating txs for your wallet and relaying txs and blocks to peers are things it still does fully.

I would posit that when people buy BTC they are thinking about how much fiat they will put in not how much BTC they get out. So if a certain amount of buying is going on each week then it's clearly valued in fiat. When the existing new supply drops then it will be felt by the market to the extent it interacts with that fiat amount currently balancing it. I see it making sense to estimate market impact in fiat terms rather than in percent bitcoin supply terms. I think it's why the last two times most thought it would have no impact or was priced in. 
I don't think it can be priced in because unlike other commodities btc is not required and consumed by anyone. Even when you buy in advance to sell after the event it turns out that the new supply drop still causes a rise and you want to hold until that is fully played out (FOMO). So it drops harder, faster when it's breaking point is eventually reached.

There is many many wallets that don't need the blockchain. The best well known one for desktop is [Electrum]( But also all phone wallets: Mycelium, Copay, breadwallet don't need to download the blockchain. For general desktop use I'd highly recommend Electrum - it's proven itself over the years since 2011, and has many nice features, including hardware wallet support. It connects to random (or manually selected) servers for tx history and verification. There's about ~30 servers all run by volunteers. All entirely free open source.

Ya, if you had received many tx in your wallet and not spent them then you could have a lot of inputs to a full balance spend, making it pretty expensive. And if Mycelium doesn't calculate fee well you could end up just as stuck again. You'd definitely want to choose the priority fee rate. To work quickly with CPFP you need to pay enough to cover both stuck and current size tx at a suitably high rate.

One property of SSS is that the size of each piece does not exceed the size of the original data. So if you use the 256 bit value used to construct a seed word list (which has some extra checksum bits) as your input then you should have multiple 256 bit output pieces.
These pieces could be checksum'd and converted to words as would have been done by the original, giving a more friendly way of storing the parts that can be saved on paper rather than raw binary data on some digital media. 
But I have never seen an implementation done following this scheme for seed storage. Is there one like this out there or a reason why it's not been used? 
Should I write a python tool that takes a BIP39 word list and spits out N parts encoded as words and can also recombine parts?

You're so abrasive I'm sorry I ever tried to make any suggestions or help. You've got it all figured then. With an HD wallet you will be able to recover all change keys from the seed - do that and check your address is there. Funds recovered.
Any two output tx will look like you suggest from the wiki. You cannot tell a change output from a non-change output. The difference is that change will not show in the wallet as a second tx when the address is known as a change address. Yours does. Hence, it's either not change or your wallet has lost track of it's change addresses. The latter should be recoverable from seed if it is indeed generated from the same seed. And if it's not, no conspiracy involved, simply not a change address from your wallet. I'll leave it at that since you think hacking is impossible.

Not sure what you mean. Any extra steps are optional. 
Most Electrum users probably write their seed on paper and store in a safe place, and use a password on the wallet.
Additional steps are purely up to you if you feel you want or need additional levels of security. 
Ultimately your bitcoin is only as secure as the protection you place on your seed whether it be in a wallet file or on paper. Wallet files have been hacked many times in the past and most people are not very good at securing their PCs. So for large amounts it's wise to take extra steps like offline signing, cold storage etc.
Most of us probably never have to worry about duress passwords and such but there is probably some people out there who would find that useful.

I don't know which ones are good. Electrum allows selecting coins manually, though probably most users don't pay attention to that. I'm very keen to get updated figures. 68% as of June 2016 isn't very promising given that perhaps some may still be spent in the future. I gather that most wallets do not select based on that calculation.
There is somewhat of an issue as we would want the dust spent to reduce utxo set but obviously users lose out by spending them. It seems like at some point utxos below some given threshold should just be voided, or maybe relegated to low cost storage anyway, if wallets are ignoring them.
As far as sweeping - well, I guess the answer is to wait for Schnorr signatures as that could make it cheaper and maybe there's a way to collectively donate them to charity so they can be included in relatively few combined txs.

I could but I'm not expert enough to know if they'd work or what ramifications they'd have.
eg. when a big block node is relaying a new block to an old version node it could provide it as two (or more) consecutive 1 MB blocks. (but how would it chain properly?)

Blocks get much bigger later in the chain so early estimates according to block speed become very misleading as you get closer to the end. It gets slower and slower after about 250-300k. What many people do is sync the chain on a fast desktop and then move the hard disk or files over to the raspi.

I've never had to re-plug when signing a tx. But the prompt for passphrase in Electrum is a normal text field. So a fake/malicious Electrum could capture the passphrase. So that's a vulnerability only fixed by going back to offline signing. I'm pretty sure the passphrase is forgotten as soon as sent to the dongle but I have never checked the code to be sure.
Just to clarify - I've had my non-passphrase wallet open and used it to get an address, then opened my passphrased wallet and sent to the copied address. Electrum doesn't need to talk to the trezor until it wants to sign the tx, so it doesn't ask me to re-plug when I wanted to sign that tx.
@_date: 2019-10-02 04:36:10
I'm just poking around at info given and coming up with a reason what may have happened. You don't seem to know why your change address is not in your wallet. A hacker would do this because (1) they need your pwd to create the tx, and (2) they don't change the actual output or you wouldn't sign it, so they alter the change output - you're likely to not notice and finish the tx. Maybe that didn't happen - maybe you somehow screwed up your wallet so that change goes somewhere else. One thing I know is I do know how wallets work and change outputs work - I've been coding and working with them for 8 years.
I don't see how this is "conspiracy level shit" - people get hacked and have btc taken every day here.

That's actually a fairly simple method to remember but has a couple issues. Why didn't you choose Ace as 1 - that seems obvious to me. And it could require more than one deck, which I think is a show stopper, as you can easily require more than 4 of some digit even for much less than 12 words.
I was thinking of a product-sum approach. Sets of 4 cards where the first 3 are multiplied and the last added. I'm not sure you can represent any word with available cards as the deck is diminished but it seems there should be a combination that would match any 12 words. I don't think 24 words could work as a deck only has 225 bits entropy. (A=1,J=11,Q=12,K=13)
Q54A = 12x5x4+1 = 241
edit - forgot there is a 10 already in deck.

The price has nothing to do with what wallet you use.
I don't use Bluewallet but from quickly browsing their info it seems like a typical and reasonable mobile phone wallet. It's probably fine for small amounts up to some limit that you're happy carrying around on a phone. Beyond that it's better to use a hardware wallet or offline wallet. 
Any wallet connected to the internet has an inherent vulnerability to malware and design flaws. With an Android wallet you are always trusting that an update pushed later thru the play store isn't malicious, and that they have not made mistakes in securing the seed/keys in the app.

As long as you have kept the xpub (master pub key) private you should be good. If someone were able to get the private key for your old reused address and also your xpub then you'd be in trouble.
Situations where your xpub may be compromised are various watch-only online monitoring tools, desktop watch-only wallets like Electrum which have been hacked, or online hacked web interface for a hw wallet.
The only reason I can think that you wouldn't just make a new seed is that you spent a lot on a metal based backup you wish to keep. In that case it may protect you better to add a passphrase to your seed to generate a completely new wallet.

I used a raspi for years as my offline wallet using Electrum. It's easy and very doable. I just had an uSD card with raspbian and Electurm installed. At that time I was using the pi also as media center hooked to my tv screen. So to boot my offline (pseudo hw wallet) I just powered off, disconnected ethernet, swapped uSD card, connected keyboard, and booted to desktop. Did my tx signing and powered off again. Back to media center use. 
Now I have a better media center with ZFS disk array and do my signing with a Trezor. The raspi would still work fine as a hw wallet replacement. There have been projects over the years for wallet with LCD screen - that's cool but a lot more work. Your wallet is the uSD card. You can plug a raspi into any tv set and access your wallet. 
They do make small hdmi LCD screens too so that's another easy way. Electrum has a modular user interface layer so it'd be nice to have a small screen optimized front end. I'd see that as a nice project - hdmi screen with electrum and coding up a small screen UI module (it's python).

Electrum can restore a Mycelium seed because it supports BIP39 but Electrum's native seed format cannot be used by Mycelium.
The best way for offline cold storage (assuming you don't want to buy a hardware wallet) is to use Electrum on an air gapped offline system. But if you want to also "watch-only" on Mycelium or other BIP39 wallets, and therefore be BIP39 compatible, then you have to create the BIP39 seed outside Electrum. Then you can restore in Electrum or take the xpub to other wallets for watch-only. 
Here is a handy [BIP39 tool]( that can be used offline by copying the html file to an offline system. Then you can write down the seed words, restore in Electrum and copy only the xpub to online wallets. When restoring be sure to click "options" and check BIP39 box.
It's kind of non-ideal that Electrum can restore a BIP39 seed but not generate a new BIP39 seed.

IDK. I wasn't trying to imply that's absolutely what happened. It was more a suggestion that if he can't figure out the address origin then maybe it was inserted by malicious code. Maybe the hacker wasn't skilled or maybe he replaced change addresses in the wallet in the past and later the wallet was deleted. Can only guess. My intent was simply to warn that if something like that happened he should be careful about further txs on that system. Seems like he took it as offending his perfect opsec skills.

I wrote about this around a month ago here:
Now a bit out of date because difficulty has increased to 2,516,308,546 or ~20% and price has risen. But you can follow the same steps to get an idea what you'd be looking at now.
At todays values:
14000 / 2,516,308,546 * 6 * 12.5 * $950 / 1.471 = **0.269 US$/kWh Revenue.**
If you buy the Antminer S9 on a credit card at 15% depreciated over a year, it costs about 0.302 US$/hr. Then subtract electricity cost, pool fees and how little your time is worth.
Even with free electricity you're barely covering hardware cost. ie. over all things haven't changed much over the last month - better to buy btc unless you really need them untraceable.

Why is there two txs? If you sent $10 in a tx then the change part would not show up as a second tx. A second tx means another spend was made. If not by you then possibly malware on your system grabbed your password and created that tx at same time.
Check your $10 tx on an explorer and see where the change went. Then check the other tx and see if it spends from that same change address. If so, then your real lesson here is that online connected systems are not safe - they get malware all the time; which is why so many recommend hardware wallets.

You an create a CLTV address on  Sending btc to that address will be locked until set time/block. It's not a beginner process and you should probably do a short term (hours maybe) test with a small amount to be sure you understand and can spend from the address after expiry. 
Also I'd suggest saving and using the page offline for security reasons if the amount is significant to you. The CLTV script behind the address afaik cannot be spent from using other wallets. I tried once with Electrum and it couldn't handle it. That means saving the page so that you can use it to spend later, or creating a spend transaction now and saving that for broadcast later after expiry (probably best option but requires you know eventual destination address).  
*** And, always save the private key and redeem script for later use. I think the script can be recreated from key and time/block but still I'd save it anyway. You need the private key to sign the tx.

If you're exploring possible ways then pick up an [Arty 7 dev kit]( for the Artix 7 series FPGAs. It's around $100 and you can program it to do hardware sha256 and EC functions. There is open source cores out there, though maybe not optimized as much as a commercial one. That was the first step in bitcoin mining moving to ASICs anyway and the original FPGA miner core is available. I worked on it on my dev kit and it's not too hard to change it to single sha56 and then change further how it operates - well, not too hard if you have some knowledge of logic and/or logic circuits. You can do it all with free tools and using an HDL like VHDL or Verilog. It's actually a very cool little board for many uses in Bitcoin and cracking/hacking etc.

There was a post yesterday asking about this and I posted [this one]( (btw it's kind of old so screens may be changed now). I don't know of others but that I found using google anyway so maybe try that too.


Using paper can be bad if you aren't clear how things work. It's easy to get mixed up and have the change output go back to your paper. But it's not paper any more if it's been entered on a connected system, so then it's not safe. Over the years there have been posts of people screwing up when trying to spend from paper wallets and so the general consensus is they are safe until you need to spend and then easy to mess up. Also, hw wallet mfrs like to down play them for obvious reasons. It's not bad if you know what you're doing but otherwise, and if you think you may forget stuff when that day comes, it's better to use a seed based wallet even if that is still simply written on paper. 




An old style paper wallet with just a key and address does not have an xpub. Usually the public key is not even printed on paper wallets. An xpub is a term for the master public key generated from a seed and useful for further generating any number of addresses. It is companion to an xprv (master private key) and a step between the seed and useable key/address pairs.
While you could make a single key using rolled dice it's not often done. The most common method is to roll dice and enter the roll values on an offline system as input to sha256 which will use that entropy (dice) to give you a fixed 256 bit key value. What I mentioned above is using dice rolls to make a **seed**. Using the paper method (chart with words and values, diceware) means not having to run the dice value thru sha256 and you get words direct from dice value by lookup on chart. In this type of wallet you create a seed. And then you need software to take the seed and calc the xpub and then addresses from that. Unfortunately there is no way to get an xpub and addresses from seed without a computer as it's simply far too math intensive. I mean, there has been youtube videos of the process by hand but it's ridiculously slow and error prone. Anyway, with a seed based on dice you only do the rolls once to make the seed and then all addresses come from the seed (via math).




By far the easiest way is to use a Trezor. The next easiest is to make a linux boot disk, disconnect, boot and install Electrum and use that. The hw wallet saves that extra few steps but they are not so difficult. I've been using Electrum since 2011 when it was first created and also contributed code over the years so I have a high level of faith that it's good software. I've also been using my Trezor for years and the creator of that was an early bitcoiner (slush) who has a solid history in bitcoin being the first to write mining pool software and open a pool. Not that either means perfect trust - just that I feel better with that then many other options floating around. You probably shouldn't really trust but if you can't self verify due to knowledge base then you end up trusting someone, even if just random reddit users for input.
Having been around this community a long time I've seen a lot of poking holes in security and models for attack that are very unlikely to occur. You want to protect yourself from the 99.9% likely and not worry so much about the extremely unlikely - unless you are actually a person who is of interest to authorities and likely to be under surveillance - then all bets are off, you probably can't protect yourself anyway.
My suggestion from years of bitcoinning: use a Trezor, make the seed by rolling dice, restore on device, then you have offset almost all remotely probable attacks. Use it with Electrum on your desktop once to pass the xpub to Electrum. Then store it away or even wipe it. Keep the seed safe on paper and metal. Use Electrum as watch-only wallet to monitor and create new addresses. If you can manage the techie steps of creating a linux boot usb then do that and save money for Trezor - it works just the same. I did that with a raspberry pi for years before getting a Trezor. Don't get caught up in very unlikely things like usb hacks. I'm not aware of anyone ever reporting lost funds from that even though it's possible.
Using the hw wallet doesn't come with perfect security but it does reduce the chance of making mistakes - which is the most likely way of losing btc for noobs.
If you have a lot of money in btc (depends on what you consider a lot, for me it'd be over $10,000) then I'd suggest going multisig as an extra layer of defense.
Absolutely make sure you verify the Electrum download signature file and only get from official site.

Ask yourself where they might buy these from that they can sell them at that price and make a buck? To be remotely safe you would need to open it and check the hardware carefully. It could have a different cheap cpu inside programmed to mimic genuine Trezor behavior including faking firmware install/upgrade messages. It could generate seeds which are derived from their own "super-seed". It's not worth the risk and hassle for what amounts to peanuts saved.
If you really want to go cheap and you have a bit of DIY skill with a frying pan or toaster oven then make your own using the fully [open source]( plans. You can send the pcb file to china and order parts off mouser. I estimate it can be done for about $25 plus a lot of fiddly technical work.

If they had actual keys your funds would already be gone. They can  of course see and spend any funds for any key they have.
How can you pay someone to supposedly remove a key without exposing the key? And once a key is exposed the funds can be moved immediately.

@_date: 2019-10-02 23:26:04
I'm pretty sure they've explored this option in depth and decided not to, or not yet anyway. There are a few issues I see with it, and I'm likely missing others.
- updated hardware may not be much better - it just hasn't been proven vulnerable yet and may require different methods.
- it would piss off a lot of users that would now feel like their hw is unsafe and they need to buy another new one, which they'll perhaps see as a marketing ploy to sell more units (because see above).
- it draws a lot of attention to them, while they already state that all hw is hackable and only ~6% of their users view physical access as a threat they seek to prevent with a hw wallet.
I'd rather see some research into a user doable process that might make the current chip harder to glitch, eg. grinding some pins off or whatever. Not that I know that would help, but if something could be done so that a chip would need to have it's top sliced off to do the attack it would elevate the requirements beyond even well equipped lab status. Or, maybe I just don't care as I already use passphrases.

It's not a general use hardware wallet. I know it seems similar but it's not. It's single use, throwaway. At $12-15 each my main complaint is cost. To be usable for other than high values it needs to be cheaper and for high values it's going to be hard to trust it. 
For physical trades like, say, a drug deal in an abandoned warehouse, it's great as long as it's trusted. You can stick it in a usb slot and check it but it takes significant tech know-how to really trust it. Your average thug is going to be: "like wtf dat?".

They don't explain anything so that makes it hard to know but it is easy to do. I put here for others reference. Best do offline but I just tested with 25 cent tx to verify (except I have to wait an hour now to spend).
1. Create a new key pair (normal address). Save private key (you need it).
2. Create a Timelock address using pub key from above. Save given redeem script.
3. Send test btc to address. 
To spend:
1. Create a new transaction. Paste the redeem script. Click Load (needs to be online for this step).
2. Enter send to address and amount. Make sure remaining amount used as fee is correct or add more outputs to use inputs. Click Submit to get raw tx data.
3. Copy-Paste tx data to the "Sign" page to sign now.
4. Copy-Paste private key. Click Submit to sign tx. (ideally done offline)
5. Save signed tx data for later broadcast. Or Copy-Paste to broadcast page and send. 
If timelock not expired you get an error 64 - not final. I'll check again later that it broadcasts ok after timelock expires.
EDIT - Broadcast my signed and saved tx a few hours later and it was accepted on the network without problem. Total cost of both tx fees was 7 cents.

I don't think they have specific support for BIP39 passphrase extensions, if that's what you mean. Also, you cannot specify the account number yourself for deriving alternate chains. But in my testing you could add an account and then delete it, and then add it again and it would have same addresses the second time. So presumably accounts are sequential and deterministic. That would mean you can add a couple accounts of low value and then have one of higher value. Delete the high value account and one low value as well. Leaving just the base (0) account. Any casual observer wouldn't see the hidden accounts. You could verify them on a BIP39 tool to be sure they are indeed account numbers 0,1,2 etc. as that would ensure you could later recreate them whenever needed. All kind of a round about way of hiding key chains. 
Another way is to create your base seed on Mycelium, import it into an offline Electrum to create a hidden passphrase variant and send funds there. That way you only need one seed. The down side is you cannot see that account on Mycelium even though it is always there. 
In that case Mycelium acts as a key store for the seed/xprv that you can export to recover offline funds in Electrum. And incidentally sending the xpub to Electrum, or other apps, would allow sending btc to that hidden wallet, and watching it, without risk of any spending from it.

I'd agree if every mobile had an ASIC mining chip in it. Otherwise the fact that an ASIC mines about a million (billion?) times faster than a mobile cpu even at same temperature/power use makes it very unlikely. I don't have current figures so I just made up that number. It's not worth my time to go dig up the current ASIC rates vs. ARM CPU rates. I mined for 3 years but stopped after 1st Gen ASICs and we're now on ~~4th~~ 5th Gen is it?

I believe you can do the CPFP on bitcoin-qt as well.  Not sure about double spend though. I don't know if bitcoin-qt will remove the tx if bitcoind restarted to clear the mempool or if it holds on to unconfirmed txs anyway. I suspect it does and you'd have to do something else.

This is secure as long as on SSL link. But using an address for login is a nuisance. 
A similar but better way is the take a username and passphrase and hash that to create a key pair. Then use that to authenticate. No need to bother with address - just sign up with public key (stored on server) and authenticate by signing server supplied random value with private key, and retuning for server to verify.

Your btc will either get confirmed or end up back in your wallet - there is no other outcome. blockchain.info seems to be dropping txs but not showing them as dropped in wallets. Weird and buggy but fortunately the actual Bitcoin blockchain works better than their web site.

It need not be a single instance. I mean if you have three people in different places they can create multisig wallets. Each one has it's own (different) word list and you need to send your xpub to the others in some way to finish creating their wallets. I was playing around with it yesterday. 
The only hassle I thought was that you needed the xpub from your co-signors at wallet creation time which kind of means you need to all do it at the same time - unless I'm missing something about that.
It has a couple sliders where you choose N of M for the wallet. I tested with 2 of 3 and had to open 3 instances of Electrum to complete the wallet. But all 3 did create identical address lists. Actually it was kind of cool seeing the list of 3xxx... addresses.
It also supports multisig with one (or more) hardware wallet as a signor. I didn't try that but will soon. I think maybe a Mycelium wallet could be a signor but I'm unsure about that.

Yes, your seed is all you need to recover your bitcoin.
Many private keys can be generated from your seed using complex but repeatable math. 
All bitcoin are recorded in the blockchain (on the network) but your keys are needed to update the blockchain by signing transactions. 
So your wallet does two mains things - it stores your seed (allows generating all your keys), and it accesses the blockchain to show you your transaction history. It does the math for signing new transactions and broadcastng them on the network.

All you need is a corrupt/bad random number generator (RNG). Android had that for some versions until fixed (years ago). People were able to use the knowledge of the bad RNG to deduce a set of likely keys and then scan those in much less time than the entire 256 bit range.
Ideally you'd roll dice to choose the value for your seed and many have done that (including me to create a seed I restored on my Trezor).

If you can spend money overseas for mining hardware then you should carefully consider the ROI compared to just buying btc. In my calculations even with free electricity the return of mining is lower than the cost of money. Tying up capital in equipment returns less than tying it up in btc, plus it's even more of a risk because difficulty is still going up. Calculate based on increasing difficulty and also consider you need to get equipment back across borders without hassle or loss - something you don't need to do with btc.

Since no one has helped you out, guess I'll give a summary.
HD = Hierarchical Deterministic
**Hierarchical**: means the wallet has a hierarchy of multiple accounts and chains of keys within it. More flexible than one set of keys.
**Deterministic**: means the chains of keys are mathematically determined in a repeatable way. So one seed always gives the same set of keys.
The most common standards set is BIP32, BIP39, BIP44 with each of those detailing different aspects of the wallet structure. For simplicity users often just refer to BIP39 but in most cases this also builds on the other two. This is not the only way to make a deterministic wallet and indeed the Electrum default wallet algorithm is different.
To give you a simple idea of how to determine a chain of keys from a seed (but not the way BIP32 works) imagine a series of integers 1,2,3 - that series is always the same. Now combine that with a seed value and hashing eg. 
    seed = '123456'
    series = '1','2','3'...
    
    key  = hash ( seed + '1' )
    key  = hash ( seed + '2' )
    key  = hash ( seed + '3' )
    ... and so on, as many as you need.
Of course, such a simple scheme may not be very safe but this does work. You can generate a keypair from any random number 256 bit number as output by the sha256 hash.
Actually, BIP32 has more complex math and sequencing along with 512 bit hashing and ways of hardening the different key chains (otherwise knowing a private key and master public key could lead to calculating all private keys). 
For actual details read the BIPs mentioned above. Just google BIP32 for starters.

This is because there are several bitcoin address types and paxful has not upgraded to support the new type that your wallet is using. Electrum supports several address types but only one type per wallet. So the answer is to create another wallet of older type - choose  legacy when creating it. You can have both. If fees are low now you may want to send on again to your segwit wallet once received. You'll save fees later (when maybe higher and worth saving) if it's in your segwit one. Also, you might give feedback to paxful to upgrade. It's quite pitiful a couple years on to be negligent of Bitcoin advances.

I have a Trezor One. The operation of the device is determined by the Trezor plugin which I believe is created by Satoshi Labs (open source). It's not actually Electrum that implements the passphrase handling. So I guess it's Satoshi Labs who decided it was adequate to type it on the computer - or simply there was little alternative given how much of a burden entering a long string on the device would be. It would probably cause users to choose short passphrases for convenience. The main purpose of the hw device has always been against online theft and capturing the passphrase is useless without the seed/device. Since seed words should be written down there is always a vulnerability with physical access. But I agree it's less than perfect if you are trying to get ultimate security.

You can create a multisig wallet in Electrum using your existing seed. Combined with the seed from the new Trezor it will give you a new wallet and different addresses. Then you can use your old wallet and send a tx of full balance (or less if you want to lave a decoy amount) to a new address in your new wallet.
These hardware wallets use BIP39 seeds which do not encode the wallet type in the seed. Unlike a native Electrum wallet you can use the same seed as a signor on multiple wallets.
As long as you have your seed words written down safely you can try this out without worrying about losing btc, though you may want to verify your words by doing a test recovery first. I know the Trezor has a test recovery option, not sure about Ledger.
You can also use the base seed and add a passphrase for the new wallet signor. In fact, you can make a multisig where each signor is simply a different passphrase instead of devices (though it's a bit trciky as you have to re-plug the device for signing). 
If you want to use a new seed on your Ledger then as long as you can do recovery (have the old seed) you can wipe it and create a new seed, then create the new multisig wallet. Then go back and recover the old seed, send btc to the new wallet, wipe again and recover the new seed for the new wallet. I'd only do that if you have some reason to believe the current seed has been exposed or compromised because of the unnecessary steps.

QuadrigaCX does allow withdrawing through Paypal. It has USD exchange as well as CAD and apparently supports both for Paypal, though I've never tried.

If the second address is not in your wallet then it's not change. Change doesn't show up in tx list as another tx - it is ignored as part of your own wallet. But a hacker could modify a tx (alter wallet software) to send change to their own address as a form of theft. Unless there's something we're missing here as to why change would go to an address not in your wallet. I think you said you have an HD wallet and in that case change is always derived from the same seed and should be there even if lost you wallet file and had to recover from seed.

Assuming the master public key is not kept private, it can be used with a private key to calculate others. You're better off to make him his own wallet and send btc to it. You can keep a copy of his wallet for your own use (let him know, of course). You could use multi-sig but if you don't want to both be co-signors then it has no benefit (well, other than normal hacking issues).
Also, another trick is to use different accounts on the same seed. There is key hardening between accounts so that private keys between them can't leak info. In Electrum only with BIP39 restore can you create multiple accounts based off a single seed - so that would mean using an externally created seed. Probably not worth the extra hassle unless you really see an advantage in having a single seed.

The basic idea is that the block size stays the same so that old nodes can still accept them - that's why a soft fork works. But outside of the block is more data - the witness / signature data. And now it's summed up differently. So with 1MB we can now fit more txs in because some data is moved outside (but not thrown away). The ratio of how many txs can fit depends on the type of tx and number of signatures / inputs. The last estimate reported a few days ago said that SegWit could likely have the equivalent tx count of 2.1 MB blocks. So 2.1x as many txs fit in the same 1MB because much of the data is outside, and not counted. 
Only a special case of a block being filled with txs having many signatures would it be equivalent to a 4MB block. That is an extreme which doesn't typically happen.

The Android Electrum is pretty limited and sluggish but mostly Electrum is known for it's desktop version and that has many useful features, eg. offline signing, send to many, fee controls, child-pays-for-parent, rbf, viewing coins (utxos) and coin control (choosing which coins to spend from) and more. It's more suitable for advanced users although not hard to use if you ignore the extra features. It works well as an interface for most hw wallets, and can be used with electrum-personal-server (and your own node) for more privacy than many other wallets.

You don't use that option during the install. You can use it after installed to force which server to use but you can also just start from desktop as usual and then manually set the server in the network dialog options. Or edit the menu/icon start command to have the extra option. You should probably add --oneserver as well if you want to prevent any requests to external servers.
Anyway, if you want to start it from terminal then it seems from your tries that it is not in the system path and so you need to prefix it with the path to the program. You will need to find the location for the program and then add that path to the front of the electrum command. Without experience using terminal on a Mac I'd suggest just starting from desktop. 
It also occurred to me (not being a regular Mac user) that the reason you are having trouble is you may need to quote the option value as it's being misinterpreted. If you can run the program from the terminal then it should also run with option. Try adding "" around the option, eg. `--server "localhost:50002:s"`

I'm not sure this image really is a good metaphor but I guess you can kind of see it as meaning 2 out of 3 is enough to succeed.
Multisig is a type of address that requires multiple signatures to spend from. The number of signatures can vary but one popular option is to have 2 out of 3 signers needed to spend. So you create an address using 3 keys (often held by 3 different people or entities) and only 2 of the 3 keys are needed to sign a transaction spending from the address for it to be valid on the network.
This is often used for security (need to hack at least 2 separate keys to steal), or for asset control (business partner needs to approve spends).

Ya, the newer Electrum has some nice features. You won't gain this time from RBF but you could still fix the stuck tx by using CPFP.
An adequate fee used to be pretty low and didn't change much. Nowadays the fees are more dynamic and change according to network load. Larger size txs need a higher fee and Electrum will correctly calculate that now based on byte size and prevailing network load. Right now about 80 sat/byte or more will get fast confirmation.
CPFP - means Child Pays For Parent. This just means using a new tx which depends on an unconfirmed one can pay for the unconfirmed one by adding more fee. So here is a step by step as I can't find my earlier one. For Electrum:
- right click unconfirmed tx and choose details.
- make sure there is an output you control - will be highlighted in green
- note that address in green and find it in your address tab (Ctrl A) (may be in change/used sections)
- right click the address and choose Send From - this adds the unspent unconfirmed output to your send screen
- choose a new address from your wallet and copy/paste in your send to field
- set a fee that covers the size of your unconfirmed tx plus the size of this new tx (the dynamic fee slider moved to right is usually enough)
- set a tx amount less than amount available on address 
- send new tx.
This will only cost you the fee because the btc sent will go back to your own wallet. But when a miner sees this tx covering the cost of the unconfirmed one it will add both to the next block.
@_date: 2016-11-05 12:44:46
Is one of the output addresses one you own, eg. 15XHV78nD7sHJGUeiGYL4EvgNqAnDzFJrf or the other one? Do you have the private key for that change address? If so, then I think you can use CPFP to get it confirmed. You may also be able to do a double spend as many nodes/miners may have dropped the old tx even if some others are showing it still. One or the other should work.
To do CPFP you don't need a special wallet. For example, install Electrum and create a new wallet. Write down the seed safely as backup. Once you have the wallet choose, menu item Wallet, Private Keys, Sweep. Enter change address private key. It should create a sweep tx to this new wallet. Make sure you set a good fee to cover both the old tx and the new one - so double whatever seems good for one tx in this case. Send it.
With CPFP the miner should see the new tx depends on the old unconfirmed one and assign the new fee to pay for both. Cross your fingers and within a few blocks it should confirm but it does depend on the old tx being still present in the miners mempool and they support CPFP. So it's not a sure bet. 
If it doesn't confirm after a while then you can probably do a double spend instead. In that case do as above again but instead of the change address private key you sweep the original address (14rKNREzmPNvHcayyqNh7Ua1X9Fpf7JP5n) private key with a decent fee. You can try that first if you prefer to not send btc to @_date: 2019-10-13 21:11:23

There's various open source software around for this. You can have a look at mine ([sqlchain]( written in python, if that interests you). 
Most require a lot of disk space beyond the blockchain size (2-3x or more) but mine can actually run in ~50% less space than the blockchain (using pruning node, rocks db engine and throwing away signature data). They all require a fast SSD and good CPU to perform reasonably. sqlchain is more a db and API layer and leaves it to you to provide a nice front end that uses the api. There is a simple example included. You can customize the api and it supports some altcoins and extending for others.

You don't need the wallet.dat if you have the seed words. But having the wallet.dat is faster for restoring and will include any details like descriptions etc. Restoring from seed will require rescanning the blockchain whereas wallet.dat would just load as usual. 
Treat wallet.dat as a normal backup but the seed words as emergency backup when wallet.dat is lost or corrupted.

You can verify the hardware and build the firmware yourself a lot easier then you can verify any OS and wallet/util software you may use otherwise. You can also use it on an offline system so there's no way for it to call home. And again, I'd suggest rolling dice for your seed since you're super paranoid. For peace of mind it's the only way to not depend on RNG code you'd have trouble verifying (the Trezor has a hardware TRNG built in the STM32 cpu chip).

To make your Electrum wallet more safe ensure the seed is written down on paper and stored safely. Then select menu Wallet, Info and copy the **xpub** value to the clipboard. Then select menu File, New/Restore, choose a filename, select "Standard", "Use Master Key". Paste the **xpub** value in there. Make sure the new wallet created has your addresses and balance. 
Now use some shred/secure delete utility to permanently delete the original wallet file. This gets your seed off your computer and leaves you with a watch-only wallet. There is some chance your seed has already been compromised, in which case too late, but if it hasn't then this protects you going forward against any malware that may later be a threat.
Your seed word list is the ultimate backup for your wallet. It is used to generate all keys for signing btc transactions. You can make redundant copies if you like but be aware that any of them found by others allows theft. So any copies made must be safely stored, well hidden, or properly encrypted.

Try Electrum. Choose File, New/Restore. Enter a file name. Choose "Standard Wallet". Then "I already have a seed". Enter words.
If the seed words won't work at first try then choose the "Options" button and choose "BIP39 seed". Many wallets use that format and Electrum can restore it but it's not a default setting. Also, if a passphrase was used in creation then choose the "Use custom words" option. It will prompt for the passphrase after seed words screen.

For me the issue would be more about data cost. It's just too high for me still. I run a  node at home and it would make more sense to have a mobile wallet that takes advantage of that.

Probably. I know on the Trezor the firmware can be reloaded. I just wonder at the reliability of doing that. In theory a cpu inside could be programmed to act as if it has been wiped and reset when it actually just keeps it's current code (and seed). If you open it and verify the chip and program it low level using JTAG (or dedicated) pins then you'd have a lot more confidence. But doing that is more work than the savings would be worth.

Blocks are relayed between peers. If some peers get a different block then it doesn't matter (as long as it is valid). The next block will get built by a miner on one of available current blocks and when that new one is found it will get relayed as well, orphaning the one that was not built on. It is possible for some nodes to be on the "wrong block or chain" temporarily for some time. That's why the correct chain is always the longest one (or more accurately, the one with the most "work"). There is no central arbiter of what is the right block. It happens by selection based on most work on any potential chain. Most "re-orgs" (as these are called) happen naturally within 1-2 blocks but there have been a few longer ones. I don't recall now the longest ever.
You might think of it as evolutionary with survival of the hardest working. When Bitcoin finally makes sense it's like a light bulb exploding in your brain.

Using a number or email address like that would require a central authority to manage the number/address assignment. That would remove most of the good aspects of Bitcoin: decentralization, no central controller to shut down and censorship resistance. 
The way addresses work now is a result of how public key cryptography and hashes (one way functions) work in Bitcoin. Changing that has many security and privacy implications.

If you mined some then they should have a very short history before stopping in a coinbase tx. BUT if you mined for a pool, which I'm guessing is likely, then they may not stop that quickly as some pools don't share the coinbase directly to miners. They may sell the coinbase as virgin coins and recirculate older coins as payouts. There were some that did that but I have no idea how common it was. Eligius (LukeJr's pool) was the only pool I know that paid out actual coinbase as a split. Most paid to an address and then later paid out or mixed with other coins.
If you **can't** trace back to a coinbase within a few hops then I'd say you probably can't be sure either way. To trace just plug an address into an explorer and hit the previous input button a few steps back and see if it stops in a coinbase.

Are you sure that wallet.trezor.io won't work on your Chromebook? I thought they designed that all around Chrome stuff anyway. It should work with WebUSB and if it's not right now it may only be due to a bug in recent Chrome browser (due to be fixed, but you can downgrade for now). Check your browser version. If you're using a ledger, well, I don't know about that at all. Gave up after buying the Nano (original) and it being useless.
@_date: 2019-10-17 07:47:33
You can do it by having the address on a connected system and then sending the tx offline to sign, and back to online to broadcast. This is how any offline signing wallet works, eg. Electrum - watch-only using xpub (master public key) to generate addresses and create txs. Electrum with seed/keys offline that only takes tx data and signs it. The offline Electrum works very much like a hw wallet in process, just more complicated for noobs to set up. But it is free.

I worked with the original Avalon chips at board design / firmware level. When they found a golden nonce they would shift that out serially while waiting for and starting the next midstate to hash. So that was the only output possible from the chip. Later gen chips may have changed but probably more in xfer protocol then function. The sha hasher was a rolled out 64 stage pipeline which makes it only fast when doing sequential hashes as the input at each clock cycle could be a counter increment, whereas normally data had to be shifted in for a start state. In your case you need to wait 32 clock cycles before the output data can be fed back in. So right away you are at least 32 times slower, but only if the internal design could be changed. So an FPGA solution is possible as you can alter the output to go back to input but you still need 32 clock cycles for a full hash. Well, if the FPGA has enough logic you could roll out several full hashes and only feed back to input after that. So if 32 full hash rolled out cores can fit in the chip then you could approach near single cycle rates. Not sure what will fit in the low end Artix but higher density always costs more. Still likely cheaper than GPU if going in without worrying about dev time. FPGA rates are much, much lower than current ASICs.

Others have answered your question. I would just note something you say is a bit off and I'd just clarify this.
The blockchain is a ledger of blocks of transactions maintained by nodes around the globe. Most of those nodes do not mine at all. They run a node to ensure their wallet and transactions are independent requiring no trusted third party.
Some do, and typically they are pools used by miners to share rewards for their small mining contribution. Often these miners may not even be running a node or have the blockchain on their system (though of course they are free to do so if they want, it's not required). These miners rely on the pool to build blocks and relay on the network.

It's all quite a bit to explain. I'd suggest using an old/spare system or a usb stick and installing Linux there. There are many tutorials around and I won't repeat again. Once you have a booted Linux system (say, Ubuntu, Mint, Debian, Tails - all pretty similar) you can proceed by opening a terminal window to run some commands. You typically find the terminal program in an "Accessories" menu as with other programs.
Follow these steps for installing Electrum from source (press &lt;enter&gt; after each boxed command). 
1. Install git at command line (terminal). `sudo apt-get install git`
2. Use git to clone the Electrum source. `git clone  (that will create an electrum directory with source code).
3. Change to that directory. `cd electrum`
4. Install according to instructions in electrum readme.
        sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
        python3 -m pip install .[fast]
5. That installs python modules and puts everything in the right place for importing into other scripts like the one I gave as example. Now you can try creating my script and running it. Use a text editor like `gedit`, and copy-paste the script source into it's window. Save it with some filename eg. `find_seed.py` in your home folder.
6. In the terminal if you are still in electrum folder you'll want to get back to home. eg. type `cd ~`. Now you can finally run the script with `python3 find_seed.py`. As is, with no changes, it will use the example seed words and start listing valid seeds that are possible. Press `Ctrl-C` if you want to stop it running.
If that works then you will want to change the seed words to your own and try running. Anyway, if you get as far as all that or have issues then just msg me or comment here.
I realize this is all a bit of a challenge to do for a non-technical user. The alternative is to have someone else do it but that typically requires giving them seed words and that's not a great idea either.

When you want to send btc it will prompt for the passphrase right before the Trezor shows the confirm details. It is needed when the wallet is created as well but otherwise the wallet is "watch-only" and uses the xpub to manage without needing it.

Their customer is the vendor and the vendor should be covering any internal tx costs as part of their fees just like CC fees cover all the business expenses and fraud costs of their operators.

@_date: 2019-10-16 06:56:22
Umm. No. You're thinking of a password for a file but I'm talking about a passphrase on the seed itself. In that case even if they have the seed they still need to brute force the passphrase. If you make it suitably strong that can be very difficult.Maybe read up on BIP39 more so you understand. That is what most hw wallets use and they all support adding a passphrase (well, Trezor and Ledger do anyway).
@_date: 2019-10-08 00:25:52

The RNG in Trezor is a hardware circuit built into the STM32 series cpu. Here's a report of it's testing to [NIST]( standards.
The Trezor code that uses the RNG is it's firmware and I think that is verified during the firmware upgrade process. That's not perfect but it's reasonably good. I'm pretty sure a device with replaced cpu and suitable code can probably emulate that process (with a cpu containing more memory, or alternate, and a lot of dev work). I have not seriously gone deep on that so I could be wrong.
If you don't want to trust the built in RNG then you should probably use [diceware](  to generate a BIP39 seed and restore that.

And even if you were a director of a foreign business you would be taxed in Canada based on your residence and net income.
You can actually do whatever you please but if you get investigated/audited then they will use their rules not your idea of the rules. I'm not sure why your accountant or lawyer can't answer that.

The only non-in-person way I'm aware of is using irreversible pmt on localbitcoins.com or similar sites. I haven't checked recently but sellers did used to deal with buyers without ID as long as pmt is assured, ie. postal money order, cash in mail, maybe still western union or moneygram (though now I think even they need ID, but that may be better than unknown sellers). 
edit: I do see there is cash-by-mail in Norway on localbitcoins. You could try that at. The seller has to escrow the btc with the web site so that you know it can be released. I'm not familiar with how you prove delivery for localbitcoins so you should check that first. A bit risky no doubt.

As safe as without pruning. 
It is only as safe as your overall system. If you are doing other daily stuff like web browsing on that system then you are always vulnerable to malware. For small amounts that's not a big deal. But as you get more btc you are very much recommended to keep them in an offline wallet (cold storage). 
A hardware wallet is an easy and convenient way to have it offline but they currently do not work with bitcoin-qt so a better choice would be Electrum, or the software that comes with the device. 
There are several ways to setup an offline wallet that are free but require more learning/tech skills (old laptop, or usb linux boot stick). If you are just dabbling for now with small amounts then go ahead and use bitcoin-qt with pruning. It will be worthwhile understanding how a node works.

The simplest way is to have a watch-only wallet on any device, like a tablet or phone, and use it to display QR codes. Electrum is good for this but others work. You just create the wallet with an xpub (master public key) generated by you offline on your own wallet. Whoever has the watch-only wallet can accept pmts but never spend from the wallet.
You can get more complex with btcpayserver and other solutions. In all likelihood pmts by btc will be so far between that a simple watch-only wallet is adequate. Maybe look at Coinbase commerce as that gives you a similar ability to display QR codes for pmts but lets you control your wallet. It only needs an xpub to work in same way but maybe needs to be embedded in some web page that could be a static page on a tablet or phone.

It's possible it might (though properly verifying should make it unlikely). Which is why it cannot ever be connected again. As long as any key info is stuck on the offline system it cannot be sent back to the hacker. You do need to check your tx details whenever you sign (and before broadcast) to be sure they are not changed. But you need to do that even with hw wallets or else you are also at risk.

Just write down the seed and safely store that. The master key is derived from the seed so it's not needed. 
Note that to delete stuff on your computer securely you need to wipe/shred it otherwise it may be findable later, though without a password it may not be useful. And with an SSD / memory stick even that may not be adequate.
The safer way would be to use an offline (not ever connected to the internet) system to create a new seed and then store that. Then send your btc balance to that wallet's first address. But it's only safer if there is any chance your system is already compromised and if it were chances are btc would already be removed.

I'm not sure why that post uses 4096 for Trezor seeds. Both BIP39 and Electrum now use a 2048 words list. Electrum v1 used to be the shorter 1626 (and very little hardening) but that hasn't been the case for years.
An important difference is that BIP39 seeds use PBKDF2 w/SHA512 hardening which makes guessing seeds much slower than guessing private keys. Checking also depends in both cases on how addresses are looked up in a utxo table. If that table is in memory then it can be fairly quick but likely not anywhere as fast as simple sha256/ripemd hashes or even the EC Pt. multiply for pubkey generation. 
Also, each xpub &gt; pubkey &gt; address sequence requires more work and an attacker has to decide how many are worth doing for each (seed+passphrase) combo. If you don't use the first N addresses in your wallet an attacker may not even detect your wallet if they only check N-1 pubkeys per seed.
All of this means attacking a seed is much more work then just private keys, hashes for mining, or AES encrypted data alone.

You glossed over that they are also co-insurer. So they self insure and do not indicate what exposure that is, what percent of third party vs. themselves. The part they self insure is basically them saying "trust us, we'll cover your loss". Is it 90% or 10% or ?.
And I'd like to know if USD amounts are actually covered 250,000 per user or once per overall custodial account? If they are licensed as a bank or have banking agreements in place per user then I suppose they get FDIC per user but if they are just plunking it all in their own (segregated) bank account then isn't that the total coverage for all user funds?

As long as your wallet lets you set the fee you can set any fee. Miners take highest fee first so if there is less volume they fill up with lower fees and that is slower.
BUT, you said something about Bitpay. Did you mean using their wallet? If so be careful and check send options first. They are not very supportive of btc and their wallet may purposefully limit the fee you can use. ie. not allow very low fees. And they have not enabled segwit (which lowers fees by 50% or more). So if you have a choice I'd suggest using a better wallet.

That adds redundancy. It's weakness is systemic in the hw wallet chosen. If one fails due to some inherent device problem the others may do likewise. But it does protect against loss/damage of 1 or 2 devices.
I personally think you should consider a found device as fairly soon compromised. The passphrase is the only real security then. This may not be always true but if looking at lower bounds (worst case) on security it should be considered. 
Also, if using hw wallets for redundancy without paper copies I see little difference between that and using 3 usb sticks with encrypted word list. Or, perhaps a combo of one hw wallet (easy to access funds) and 2 encrypted usb sticks (redundant seed backup). An encrypted usb stick is probably more secure than a seed stored in a hw wallet (assuming proper strong encryption, of course). A usb stick is cheaper and less conspicuous, easier to hide, or obfuscate data presence.

The BTC should be held by LBC in escrow. When he gets paid he should release it. That's normal but I don't think you should cancel the trade unless you are also sure the pmt you made will return to your account. He may be trying to receive pmt but have the BTC he put in escrow return to him. That's dangerous for you as then you'd have to trust him to send it.

You can make backups, or you can use a redundant filesystem like ZFS with multiple drives. Making backups is easy but if you require "always up" then a drive array with ZFS is better as you can hot swap a failed drive and have it rebuild. The advantage to using ZFS is it can do periodic scrubs that verify all data is intact and/or repair any bad bytes while notifying you a drive is starting to fail.
I've run ZFS on my home media server for 18 months (also bitcoin data) with scrubs once a month. Never had even one bit failed data - love them HGST 3TB drives. I went to this after years of failures with WD drives losing my videos and bit rot cropping up unexpectedly.

The problem with SSS for use with hw wallets is you cannot easily do it without setting up a temporary air gapped system and working out tools to use, which must then be documented and on hand for later. Probably you want decode the words, run thru sss and then re-encode as word sets so that it's easy to write down and store on paper. Ideally a wallet would have this all built in as, eg. an Electrum plugin.
I see multisig as a more useful approach since you can also do M of N but stay in the realm of word seeds and wallet software. You need wallet software for getting the mpk for each part to create the actual wallet. This is all doable with Electrum but still requires a temporary air gapped system.

If you run a full node you can connect Android Electrum to it as well (via EPS). There are some other mobile wallets that can connect to your own full node. I think Samourai comes to mind but also others I don't recall off hand.
A light-client isn't "unsafe" as such. It's depending on other servers for validation and wallet history. Most use SPV methods to ensure a pretty high level of verification. They can do things like deny service, or prevent you knowing txs have occurred but they cannot steal btc or alter txs. They can track your addresses and link it to your IP address thus leaking privacy info. If you are doing anything you want to keep private then mobile/light wallets are probably a poor choice unless configuring and using with your own backend/server.
A mobile wallet is possibly safer than a desktop wallet for users who aren't careful with security on their desktop - and that's probably most users. Android and iOS both provide better app/data separation than most users can maintain on their desktop - especially those likely to share desktops or use torrents or access questionable web sites.
There are ways to get almost everything. For example, you can use a Trezor wallet on Android with your own node as backend providing mobile, high security and privacy. It's a bit of a deal to setup and I haven't gone that far myself.

Possible, but useless. You could define an address standard that incorporates SSN as part of it's definition. But I doubt very many would run the software (nodes) that accepts that address type. You could optionally include such data as OP_RETURN output in txs, cluttering up the blockchain, but as the protocol exists now it would not pay any attention to that data. I suspect any service that required that for btc deposits would be shunned and what would be the point. Anyone who knows some random SSNs could just plug them in and the service would need an out-of-band verification anyway. ie. useless.

If you're buying a computer to destroy then make it cheap one like a raspberry pi. It can hook to your keyboard and hdmi tv set for display. Install raspbian and create your keys/seed there.

It makes a pretty decent kodi media system too (for watching movies). Just destroy the uSD card. It can be an old 8GB one you'll never need.

That's why you use an offline machine. So even if the script has the key (which it does otherwise it can't encrypt it) then there's nothing it can do with it. It can't send it anywhere or create and broadcast any tx.

A hardware wallet is a small dongle like device which stores a seed value used to generate keys/addresses in the wallet. It can sign a transaction when given the data (via usb). 
The advantage is that malware cannot infect the device and it usually has a small screen to present the details like address and amount for confirmation. This screen is critical as it means that your host computer cannot present fake details on your desktop to trick you into signing a different transaction in the background.
You still need to be sure that the address presented matches the  payment address provided by a web site or person you are paying.

I understood the xor idea right away. Just wondered if there was an easy to use word based tool someone might use. I think it would be easy enough to make a BIP39 compatible xor tool. It's kind of a nice idea except it doesn't support M of N. Although it seems like some variants like 2 of 3 may be doable with partial word combos together with xor. eg. each has (16 words-bits)+filler_rand_bits (haven't quite worked it out).
edit - oh, I think can do 2 of 3 with just 16 words each, no xor req.

Electrum is an open source project on [github]( currently having 1794 forks. That means 1794 other people have made their own copy and in many cases pulled down to their own computers. If the original project was shutdown today there would be that many users worldwide (likely many more who just cloned it locally) who have the code and could continue the project on their own or in groups that formed around them. This all makes it highly resilient to any kind of shutdown. 
As long as people want to use it, develop and enhance it Electrum will be there. It is so popular it is one of the only wallets forked and modified for many altcoins. It also currently has 235 contributors - that is coders who have added their work to it. I am one of them (though a couple years ago now) and always have an updated copy on my system. A few dozen of these likely have a fairly in depth understanding of the code.
If there is any wallet out there, other than bitcoin-qt obviously, that is likely to live on through it's user base this is the one. But besides that for multisig to function you don't even really need Electrum. The specific seed format Electrum uses is unique but also clearly documented and it does support BIP39 as well. Multisig only depends on having several private keys to function. It just happens Electrum has a flexible implementation that is popular with many users.
If you are worried about the non-compatible seed aspect I'd suggest using a BIP39 seed to create your multisig wallet. Electrum supports multisig with BIP39 seeds (though it cannot create the seed - you need to use another [tool]( / [wallet]( / [dice]( along with all other popular hardware wallets and most mobile wallets.
The one obvious downside to Electrum is dependence on servers for access to the bitcoin network. Even that is offset by using [EPS]( to use your own node as the server. This makes it a feature rich private wallet on your own bitcoin node with hardware wallet support.

Personally I would run a node. In fact, I do for my own dev uses. I don't think any of the free online explorers offer a RPC compatible interface but maybe a paid one exists. I'm not sure either way.
The problem with the API method is 1) trusting the data, 2) reliability issues, they can drop out sometimes, 3) rate limits, it's hard to to hammer them for a lot of data over time. 
They are good for quick and easy uses. If you are going to code something that needs reliable data, repeatedly, then I'd suggest using your own node and direct RPC or if real time data then use the ZMQ facility a node provides. If you want examples of coding in Python around a full node RPC and ZMQ then browse my [sqlchain]( project. It's a "compact SQL layer" over top bitcoind and does all the typical block/tx processing to fill a MySQL DB.
@_date: 2019-06-15 04:20:16
That version supports pruning so there must just be something about how you enabled it. I don't know about on a Mac but probably similar to Linux. You should find a bitcoin.conf file (in the bitcoin data folder) and add a line `prune=value` where value is the number of MB to keep. I'd suggest a few GB if feasible, eg. `prune=3000`. That keeps 3GB (~two weeks) of blocks plus ~3GB of utxo data.
Then restart bitcoin-qt and it should start deleting old block files. It may take a few minutes or so.

It's a bit wordy for a comment but I'll post some details. It really needs a blog write up but there are many generic blog tutorials out there. 
Assuming you have a server hosted then you can use a reverse tunnel for the listening port and socks proxy for the outgoing. It would be two ssh commands to setup. 
(You don't actually need the reverse tunnel. It's like having a home router port forward so if you aren't doing that then it's the same if you leave it out: no listening, bitcoind still works fine.)
The model for the first ssh command is:
    ssh -NTR 8333:localhost:8333 &lt;your_server_name&gt;
(This is a reverse proxy that listens on your server and passes all traffic to the same local port where bitcoind is listening)
The model for the second ssh command is:
    ssh -NTD 9080:localhost:9080 &lt;your_server_name&gt;
(This is a socks tunnel that relays all connections on local 9080 (arbitrary) out to your server. The connections appear to come from that server's ip.)
Now tell bitcoind that it should use the socks proxy for outgoing traffic. Add this to the bitcoind conf file:
    proxy=127.0.0.1:9080
That's basically it. But...
The trick is to make this all super reliable. I'd suggest installing **autossh**, adding some small config changes and using a systemd service to manage each ssh command. The useful config lines locally (add to /etc/ssh/ssh_config) are:
    ServerAliveInterval 15
    ServerAliveCountMax 3
    ExitOnForwardFailure yes
And on the server I'd also add the first two lines above to the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file. These make the timeouts between both more resilient.
You can run those ssh commands at the console for testing but what you really want is to automate them at bitcoind start up. 
Here is an example systemd service file I use for running my btcpay server backend locally. I've modified it and removed my server name. If running two ssh tunnels as above then the simplest thing would be to duplicate this and edit so each runs the appropriate ssh command. Replace SERVERNAME with yours.
    [Unit]
    Description=BTC Reverse Tunnel Service
    ConditionPathExists=|/usr/bin
    After=bitcoind.service
    
    [Service]
    User=btc
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/autossh -NTR 8333:localhost:8333 SERVERNAME
    
    # Restart every &gt;2 seconds to avoid StartLimitInterval failure
    RestartSec=5
    Restart=always
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
I've found the combination of autossh (which just wraps ssh and restarts when connections fail) and systemd to be very reliable at keeping the tunnels open. 
One final note - the reverse tunnel above is limited to opening a server-local listening port (ie. localhost) not a public one. That can be fixed with sshd permission changes on the server but I'd suggest a better, more secure way is to simply use iptables to add a port forward so public connections get fed to the local port. I haven't done this myself because only my server gets access to my backend node. A quick google turns up the following iptables forward to add this final touch:
    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 8333 -j DNAT --to-destination YOUR_SERVER_IP:8333
You may need to change eth0 depending on your server. This may all sound complicated but it's not so bad. Actually a few config lines and creating two service files.

If your have BIP39 seed words then you should be able to restore the wallet to Electrum which does support "pay to many", either directly in the interface or by loading text or file with one address,value per line. 
If you restore from xpub then it's safer to create a tx because seed not present. But in that case the tx needs to be signed and I'm not sure if Copay or other wallets can sign such a tx.
I know a Mycelium BIP39 wallet loads into Electurm but have never tried a Copay one.
edit: I just tested with an old Copay seed I had. It created BIP39 wallet from seed without problem. I copied xpub form that and restored another watch only wallet which had same address list. Seems to work either way. No funds in my test wallet so could not verify if a tx created with xpub could be signed elsewhere.

You can find which block id matches the start of your period using an explorer, then query by rpc using `getblock &lt;id&gt; 1` and iterating over `tx` entry with `getrawtransaction &lt;txid&gt; true` if you need detail. Continue using the `nextblockhash` value until you see a `time` value beyond your range.
If you don't have a node to query on then you can use an explorer api in the same way. blockchain.info does have a day query if you have a time value (epoch time) and there are epoch-date converter sites.
*note if using your own node you must have txindex=1 in your config. You can set that and restart it will create the tx index allowing lookup of txs not in your wallet. It uses ~25 GB more space.

What "app market"? The only place you should ever get Electrum from is the official site because any other source could very easily modify the code to steal btc. I would be very cautious about your system if you have run a non-official version. It could well have malware now which will monitor your wallet and wait for btc to steal. 
Unfortunately, bitcoin wallet software is such a ripe juicy target that it requires the utmost care. Malware can do some very inconspicuous changes that lead to theft. eg. it can alter the random number gen code to produce non-random data and that will allow someone on the other side of the world to generate your keys and steal your btc. Any significant amount of btc should be stored on offline wallets or hardware wallets, both of which Electrum does support. Just a warning not to trust large btc amounts with your desktop system especially if potentially compromised by untrustworthy software.
Between Jan-Mar this year Electrum users lost over 6 miilion USD due  to fake Electurm software upgrades so this isn't an unlikely threat. Don't be a victim.
edit - Oh, it just occurred to me you mean the Ubuntu Software Center. Ya, do NOT use that. It was maintained by unofficial people and has never been vetted by the devs as far as I'm aware. I thought it wasn't even updated. You need the latest 3.3.6 version from  or from github.

Sure, but someone owns it. Which brings up another difference I neglected. Revenue. You can rent out your property but it's much harder to get a decent and trustworthy income from your btc.
I'd never argue that property is the best investment or even that I'd own some (I don't). Even if overvalued, which it may well be in some places, people will always need it to some extent.

If you're going to use an offline system I'd suggest using Electrum offline. You can create a seed offline and write that down. Then bring the xpub (master public key) to your desktop system to create a watch-only wallet. You can create new addresses as you like and watch txs easily. You cannot spend without going offline to sign but when you do you will bypass some issues with change addresses and figuring ut how to spend without compromising your key or remaining balance. This type of offline wallet is much more flexible and just as safe. This is why paper wallets with a single key are obsolete, not hw wallets - though hw wallets make this process easier.
See, 
You can transfer the xpub as a QR code to avoid any chance of compromise via media.
This has the advantage you don't depend on a single key. You can have multiple deposit addresses that prevents links between deposits and allows for better privacy when you go to spend (coin control).

The answer from `bitcoin-cli help getaddressinfo` (or maybe can do in gui console too, not sure).
**isscript** means it's an address created from scripthash (ie. P2SH, 3... or bc1).
**ismine** means it's one generated from the wallet seed (if HD), or a key in wallet.
**ischange** means it was used for change output.
All three should be true if you have a segwit or p2sh (multisig) wallet and the address is change generated from your wallet. With an HD wallet it can't forget a change address (well, unless a bug). 
But if older non-HD wallet then key/address pairs are pre-generated in batches and backups would have the same list, except in one situation - when you use the last address in an old wallet, the backup would not have the next batch generated upon next need for an address. I think batches used to be 100 keys but not sure if that changed when HD became the norm. To lose a key/address you would need to have used approx. 100 addresses and then not backed up the new wallet.

Of course you can. You can write code that makes rpc calls to the node for any data needed.

Most btc owners are not the ones needing food, water and basic items. They're tech nerds and early adopter wealthy who bought with money they can risk or bought so little it won't matter.

It's the channel states that cannot be restored and that's not something there is any way around as it depends on your actions and not the inherent properties of the seed. Since the state is "off chain" you cannot recover it by knowing only addresses. The addresses still work as now. One of the beauties of LN is the tx history is off-chain and  private but the downside of that is you cannot recover that history from public data.

I'd suggest keeping it real simple. Like install a (watch-only) wallet app on a mobile phone and just use that (present a QR code) for any pmts. 
You can do a lot more fancy POS stuff and get all setup properly but for the number of actual btc paying customers you'll get it's overboard. 
If you do a big Bitcoin promo you may get a few pmts, and you may have one or two that come back ongoing, but don't expect droves of customers lining up to pay with btc. Most places that start out this way end up a month later with one person who knows how to work it and everyone else clueless so customers often can't even pay.
So use an old tablet or phone with a watch-only wallet (no seed/private keys, keep those secure elsewhere) and keep it near the checkout. Teach several staff how to enter an amount and show the QR code. If you start to accumulate more than you want then send it to an exchange, or just be a hodler long term (best option). The amount at risk is likely going to be irrelevant to your bottom line.

Even a plain old hard disk is fine for this. It doesn't need an ssd. You could use an external drive on usb port if you have one. Just add the -data-dir option to tell it where the data is located.
If you use prune now and later change to non-pruned it will have to download the blockchain again. One way to only do that once is to use a temporary usb hard disk, sync the blockchain, copy it to backup folder. Then set prune option. It will truncate the blockchain and you can move that onto your system. You still have the full copy on the usb drive that you can copy later if you get a bigger main drive. Anyway, just ideas.

Only regressive countries are looking at banning bitcoin. If large more free countries started down that road it would have an initial price hit but long term Bitcoin would just grow more organically and it's price would reflect a more stable use-value rather than speculative fluff. It would still function as now. So one has to ask, why do that? Just to wipe out investment value? To force it's use underground and invisible to authorities? 
Even if Bitcoin fails there will be next gen coins that are more covert. Any regulatory gain is always temporary. Right now authorities have it pretty good with an open, fully public blockchain. Maybe smashing that is a step backwards.

There is no difference. Every node operator decides what node software to run. What matters is the nodes actually doing useful transactions and the software they use. A million nodes doing no (or few) transactions is just maintaining a copy of an unused ledger. Look at Bcash - it's there and working but irrelevant. 
What matters is that users with btc are able to transact on a network between them using the software they choose. The only way to stop that is to shutdown the internet. There will always be ways to subvert and code around partial blocks and laws.
@_date: 2016-12-05 07:36:49
Can you give an example of how a full node can be attacked to corrupt the blockchain? I'm sure EM could do something but I'm just wondering what. I guess the process of verifying could be altered so that fake txs get accepted while the node operator thinks the software is in control and it's not - if enough nodes had the subverted EM behavior then the network is corrupted overall. In fact this could even be done by disk firmware rewriting blocks it recognizes and wants "fixed".

blockchain.com has a long history of security failures. I'd suggest for that amount using a good mobile phone wallet and if you get more later then transfer to a hw wallet or learn how to make your own offline wallet (usb stick). 
You don't mention what wallet you are using now but if it provided a (bip39) seed word list as backup then you can restore that into many mobile/desktop wallets available without doing a transfer. Any decent wallet that allows you to set the fee, and given no hurry, should only cost pennies to transfer.

There are a few "true random" generator methods. Some aren't suitable for use in hw wallets because of complexity but the simpler ones are.
For example, static RAM when powered on often has a random state depending on thermal noise in the supply up ramp. A chip can use the initial RAM state as input to a hash function to give a good random start value - but only once per power cycle. 
Diode junctions are sometimes used for thermal noise. I've seen video sensors sometimes used for randomness because there is a fair bit of low bit noise in them, and often a large array of bits, so it can create quite a stream random bits. 
Quite a few [usb dongles]( have been made over the years as True RNG. Some chips (like the one used in Trezor and Ledger) have built in RNG circuits for using noise (analog ring oscillators) that has been tested in various ways ([NIST]( for randomness.
There's a lot more info kicking around too.

Don't assume that. Most today are BIP39 and may work but not all do and some may use variants or differing derivation paths. Best to test first - you can use words created the same way (BIP39) instead of your real wallet.
While BIP39 supports word lists of 12,15,18,21,24 length - most hw wallets use 24. Electrum uses a 12 word seed of it's own design (not BIP39) but also can restore BIP39 seed words.
Longer word lists are a bit more secure against brute forcing but even 12 words is considered safe enough.

Some wallets have a button to click on fee or next to fee that allows setting the value. Right now ( it seems like fees are low - even 3 sat/byte should get confirmed fairly soon. For a typical tx that should be around 250 bytes x 3 sat/byte or 750 sat. ~ 6 US cents. 
If you can find out how to set a fee manually that may be the simplest option. I would still move btc to a wallet where you don't depend on a third party as signor. It's fine to use multisig - it's a good option, but it should have fallbacks for when one signor (ie. block.io) fails. Or be fully under your control for all signors. I used Electrum multisig for several years where one signor was my desktop and the other was a usb linux boot stick.

I haven't used that one but I had a quick browse of their faq. It seems to be a multisig wallet. That's fine as long as they do it properly. It says your private keys are available via the settings menu. That probably means it's not a bip39 compatible wallet and you cannot get the seed words. Even if you could you would need the other signor seed as well to do a restore without their participation. That is a serious downside unless I'm missing more details of their wallet setup. There is no mention about 2of3 multisig that allows you to recover without them. So I'm assuming it is 2of2 and requires their signature. That is a real problem if they vanish or get hacked. 
Anyway, your current problem is fees. So I assume they do not let you control the fee. If they do let you manually set the fee then you can choose a low fee that will confirm more slowly. If possible do that and send btc to your own wallet. If not, then you have no option but the lowest fee rate they allow. 
If you have one or more private key values (K..., 5... data strings) in your settings page then you can import or sweep using that data into any decent wallet software you install. eg. Electrum mobile, or desktop, or Mycelium, brd or others. That allows you to set a fee on the receiving wallet rather than on the block.io wallet.

Someone asked me this via chat so I'll just post my reply below:
I print a template grid and use that to align dot positions to an alphabet line. Then I place a dot pattern in each grid location indicating letter order. It looks similar to braille but is not the same. It's simpler. I made an [svg file]( in inkscape for this (preview not aligned right but is fine in inkscape). It's easier to view rather than explain. Here is an image that shows the layout but many size variants possible.  
The dots on top line are just a reminder of order 1,2,3,4. You need four letters per word and each letter is depicted by a 1,2,3,4 dot pattern. eg. word "move", one dot in M column, 2 vert dot in O column, 2 horz dot in V column, 2 diag dot in E column. Sometimes you get combos, eg. "tooth" letters 2,3 are both O, so combine 2 horz and vert dot to make 3 dots. And so on.
Other methods (eg. Blockplate [reviewed by lopp]( use a single dot for each letter but need 4 lines per word. Mine only needs one line per word so is 4x more compact. I made mine credit card size. If using a photo 4x6 size then there is enough room to just use single dots and 4 lines per word.

AFAIK the ethernet connector on a raspi is not wired for POE itself.
If the switch can handle the power then you'd need a POE to USB type C power splitter. It takes the POE and splits the power out to a separate USB connector. PI 4 has type-C power according to specs. Not sure I've seen any such splitters yet but micro USB ones are common, though usually not rated for &gt;2A.

Since Electrum is written in Python (it's not compiled, it's interpreted) a deterministic build would refer to the packaging of source and libraries into an installable unit which can be replicated by any user and have the same result. Having this allows confirming that the installation file (AppImage, Installer image etc) provided on the web site is the same you'd get if you packaged it from github source code. 
They likely haven't done this because anyone who wants to be sure they aren't using differing code could simply clone the repo and run the python setup installer. What would be more useful is having people who regularly audit the source code for irregularities or vulnerabilities. 
Bitcoin core is different in that it actually is provided as compiled binaries for most non-dev users. Being able to validate the releases against the source by having many devs compile to identical binaries is a way of ensuring that the provided binaries aren't compiled from some alternate source code (to the extent that anyone building the source and getting a different binary makes a lot of noise).
In either case it is still possible for code to be altered/patched/replaced after it's on your system by any malware/program that has suitable privileges when run (generally root on linux or similar admin on others). If you really want to be sure you run verified code you need to run it in a secure environment where no unknown software is run with admin rights.
Even on Linux you are trusting all those packages that are managed by your update process (SoftwareManager, Synaptics, apt-get etc) because each package runs install steps (eg. deb pkg script) with admin rights, and any one of them can be modified to alter your wallet, your RNG or libraries without any notice to you. You are trusting your OS, any installed packages and their author/signors when running any wallet software.

There was a time zero fee txs would be mined but not any more. Fees vary according to network demand and are mined on a highest fee first basis to fill blocks. When blocks are pretty full then users must pay higher fees to get confirmed as they outbid others waiting.
[Here's]( a nice graphic real time view of the fee market. It show various fee levels and the notches are where txs get taken up (confirmed and removed from queue). Once you understand what this graph shows it takes only seconds to decide what fee to use at any point in time to get confirmed. You want the lowest color band that was largely impacted in the last block (has a notch). At the moment I'm posting it looks like 50 sat/byte will confirm quickly. You can pay less if you don't mind waiting. Often you can pay as low as 3-5 sat/byte making for cheap txs - it's just a matter of time sensitivity.

It's just too porous otherwise and people are constantly getting malware and hacked when they use their regular desktop/laptop.
A better choice is to make a Linux usb boot stick and boot on that to do offline signing only when needed for a transaction. Read up on Electrum watch-only wallets and offline signing. That is a much more secure but cheap way to go. If it's too much hassle then get a hw wallet for use with Windows.

The core bitcoin-qt wallet requires downloading the full blockchain. That's great for privacy and fully validating your btc but also requires a good net connection and downloading around 240GB of data. You can use pruning to avoid storing all that data on your hard disk.
Electrum is a "light-client", which means it connects to a server which holds the blockchain. That makes it "instant on" with no large data download. You are safe using it as long as you are careful to download the software from the official site and verify the gpg signature. It has a more features than bitcoin-qt from a user interface perspective but you lose privacy when your address list is shared with servers to provide wallet updates and history.
You can run Electrum as a front end for a bitcoin node using [electrum-personal-server]( Basically you wrap your own node as a server for Electrum giving you the benefits of full validation and similar privacy to bitcoin-qt but with more features of the Electrum interface (but again requiring a large data download). It's a bit more setup work but not so hard overall - though more suited to users with some tech background.
Both wallets when used on a desktop are vulnerable to any malware infections. Electrum supports working with hardware wallets to secure against these threats. bitcoin-qt is still behind in that respect though they are taking steps in adding some support. For now if you want both malware security and privacy you would need to use Electrum with EPS on a full (possibly pruned) node either with offline signing or with a hardware wallet.

The Artix 7 can do in the ballpark of 400 MHz clock so with single cycle hashing it should approach that (400MH/s).

1. A random number is generated from entropy - often thermal noise in hardware but other methods as well (like dice rolls). Lengths vary from 128 to 256 bits but 256 bits is most common (will correspond to 24 words in next step).
2. The random value is broken into 11 bit chunks (in the case of  [BIP39]( Each 11 bit chunk is used as an index to a list of 2048 [standard words]( Different language versions exist. There is usually a partial chunk left over.
3. A sha256 checksum is calculated for the random value. The first bits of this (length determined by random value length) is added to the last partial data chunk to make a complete 11 bits. That is also looked up in the word list to make the final "checksum word".
4. That word list is given to users as backup.
5. The original random number is fed into a series of math processes ([hash functions]( to create a **master private key**. It is deterministic - meaning the same input value always gives back the same key.
6. That master key is passed thru another sequence of math processes to generate a sequence of single private and public keys (again deterministic). These make up your wallet address list.
The whole process is standardized in [BIP39]( and [BIP32]( These docs give more complete and accurate details of math and example code. Various other BIP standards come into play for variants, derivation paths - things like segwit, bech32 etc.
About now you're thinking: "**wtf? how can a random number be all there is to this**"???

You can send to old addresses without reliability issues if they are your own and you know your wallet still is usable. 
The problem is assuming that old addresses are still functional for others. Many sites maintain old address watching but you should not count on it unless explicitly stated. It is always possible that some address you sent to before has now been "lost", ie. the private key for it is not kept or the owner is no longer tracking it and will not see the pmt.
There is also a slight security issue with old addresses that have been spent from already because the public key is exposed on the blockchain. While it is a bit less hard to brute force when many spends are known, I don't think it is a large concern.
For what you asked, multiple deposits to your own address, it is not a worry and you can do that without any real problem. If the deposits come from multiple sources then you are losing some privacy in that now every one of those sources knows the same address but that info likely leaks when you spend even when using unique deposit addresses (unless much care is used with coin control).

Yes, actually they do and have for several years now. They charge the buyer a (so called) "network" fee and also take a cut from the vendor. It's very far from peer-to-peer payments and the sooner BitPay fails the better. And yes when you, the buyer, send the pmt you will also add the actual miner fee as without that the btc tx will not confirm.

The first step would be to check that the node is listening as expected. Use `netstat -lntp` to verify that both 8332 and 8333 are bound to 0.0.0.0 (public). 
EPS only needs localhost so it doesn't confirm this on it's own. For port 8333 you need to have listen=1 in your config (not req but can be disabled by other settings). RPC calls on 8332 need user/pwd but peer connections on port 8333 do not. That's why some wallets need auth values or not.
If that checks out then try to connect manually from another machine using a simple tool like curl or simple python script doing rpc call. Here's a generic example I found by googling (replace user,pwd,IP):
    curl --data-binary '{"jsonrpc":"1.0","id":"curltext","method":"getblockchaininfo","params":[]}' -H 'content-type:text/plain;' 
If that cannot connect then likely no wallet can either but maybe you'll get a better error msg to track down why. For port 8333 you can try using telnet to open a connection. 
Probably not the issue but I'd advise using rpcauth now instead of separate rpcuser,rpcpassword config lines. You need to use the rpcauth util to create the auth value but the former method has been deprecated and will be removed (don't recall what version).
edit - oh, almost forgot. Check your .bitcoin/debug.log for any perhaps useful errors or info messages at time of your connection attempts.

I would suggest 12-16 mixed group letters but for me as it's important to memorize I actually used a phrase I will always remember even though it has much less entropy.

btw blockchain.info is a wallet with a long history of security failures and losses. It's a poor choice and I would not store a significant amount there. Most likely you've hit upon another failing - poor fee estimation, though you don't provide any info so who knows.
(Just checked and 2 sat/byte fees are being confirmed so it's likely not that issue now. Maybe some other failure now.)

As long as both seeds are random then the combination of parts is fine too. However, you will need to manually determine the last word. It contains a checksum validation (last 8 out of 11 bits for 24 word seed). It's easier to do that with 12 word seeds as there are only 16 to check but for 24 word seeds there are 256 possible. I made a small tool ([bip39chk]( for doing this - it can find the last word given the rest. It has a few other useful features like generating seeds from entropy (dice rolls), outputting addresses, etc.
A more usual way to have honeypots is using one or more passphrases. This is just as safe since the work required to check a passphrase is near the same as checking one without.

Electrum is safe but only as safe as the system it's stored on. You need to use with competence to maintain security. I'd suggest reading up on Electrum cold storage and offline signing if you want to know the right way to use it. That's not only to do with Electrum but any desktop wallet.

When a transaction is included in a block it is called "confirmed". After that every new additional block added to the chain is another confirmation. After a few confirmations it's extremely unlikely to ever be changed or dropped but initially with a single confirm it sometimes happens do to a block re-org and it's possible for something to cause a transaction to be changed or dropped in favour of another competing one. The general rule is the higher value of transaction the more confirms you should have before considering it safely irreversible. Many sites use 3 as the safe point.

There have been fakes made. It is, after all, fully open source hardware with pcb and schematic available on [github]( Why don't you buy one and take it apart to review? You can let us know if it's the same chip and circuit. If it is then you can reprogram the firmware and be good to go... 
I did my own cost breakdown of buying the parts off mouser.com, and ordering pcbs cheap from China, about a year ago and it would cost roughly $35-40 US to buy wholesale 10 qty and make your own, not counting time. 
So Trezor are not ripping people off when you consider all the overhead and many costs other than device parts, assembly and packaging. It's actually a pretty decent deal at their regular list price. If you want to be safe I'd suggest buying direct.
Anyway, if you do buy it then be sure to wipe and reinstall the firmware and create your own seed - don't use one already setup. Probably better to use [dice]( and restore actually. At least then you aren't using some internal possibly fake RNG code (which is one way to subvert the original device specs).

Most fiat currencies are already digital. Banks don't move stacks of bills around when they send funds between them. The most interesting aspects of Bitcoin are exactly the things that central banks (and governments) don't want.

So as long as they don't want that they will never build a currency that has what Bitcoin offers.

They could be in a wallet file, in a hw device, written on paper, stamped in metal.

It's an example based on normal small tx sizes. If your tx is larger then it could be higher. If you want an accurate estimate you would have to post your tx size in bytes of the unconfirmed tx. Tx fees depend on byte size and current network market rates, so they can very greatly depending on tx formation (number of inputs and outputs and tx type) and what everyone else is willing to pay for the next block.

Fees are high right now because half the miner hash rate has moved to the BCH chain until it re-targets it's difficulty. They'll be back when it's 4x harder on BCH and we'll see this backlog clear up.

You can try my [sqlchain]( project. It's a fairly lightweight mysql layer over top a node.

I'm still working on it. Like I just added bech32 support. Segwit is on there as of a couple months back. I'm extending it for altcoins now; currently testing with litecoin and reddcoin.

I think around 80 bits entropy is considered very good but of course it depends on the brute force complexity and the capabilities of the attacker. BIP39 passphrase cracking is fairly slow comparatively speaking so you may be fine with somewhat less. 
But assuming 80 bits how do you figure that as passphrase words? Well, first you have to use random words. Any pattern or known text is intrinsically non-random and defeats any entropy score. Then use the possible search space and calculate the log base 2. So, examples:
BIP39 word list size is 2048. So using 6 words, 2048^6 = 7.37 x 10^19
log( 7.3 x 10^19 )  / log(2) = 66 bits entropy 
(it's common to use the 50% probability as measure so subtract one bit (half) = 65)
Another example, use common English word dictionary and **randomly** select words. Say, OED length of 171,476 word count and again 6 words.
171,476^6 = 2.54 x 10^31
log( 2.54 x 10^31 ) / log(2) = 104 bits entropy.
So, obviously your dictionary matters. 
How to select random words? You could use a random number generator and convert using simple math but another easy way is the BIP39 [Diceware]( word chart. Roll dice.
Or get your home dictionary, check page count, column count and words per column and do your own math to convert dice rolls into word choices.
Incidentally, do not multiply dice rolls to get numbers (uneven probability). You have to treat as digit columns so multiply by powers of dice face count, eg. 6:  x1296, x216, x36, x6, x1 for each roll to create decimal numbers.

If your EPS is running on the same system use "localhost". If it's on another system in your network then find it's IP using any method you have and use that. I think the config will accept either a name or IP, as long as the name can be resolved (by your router or whatever).
The two lines are examples for editing the config file. If using the setconfig command then no need to edit the config file. I'd suggest just using the setconfig method. I didn't remember about that until after explaining the file edit but setconfig is easier and does the file changes for you.

It works. But one location compromised leaks 16 words and leaves 8 to be brute forced. That is 88 bits, minus 8 bit chksum, or 80 bits of entropy to attack (plus 1.6 bits if not marked for order). That is moderately achievable with significant resources but not by your average family member alone.
There are other solutions like using Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS) to split the seed in a more secure way (doesn't lose entropy). This is more complex to setup and re-acquire later especially for non technical users. 
To my knowledge no popular wallets have built in an SSS function to make this easier. Nor the more simple XOR method for N of N type splitting.

Use a [RiscV]( processor on an FPGA board like an Arty7 ($99)(just as a demo/dev idea, at least you know exactly what is in the design). There's also [SiFive designs]( and chips.
There is one or two companies now making ASICs based on the RiscV. It seems like someone could make a deal with them to build a RiscV chip with integrated secure element - maybe when the market is big enough.
Granted, even if you made the chips yourself you'd never know what they may do at the fab. There will always be some level of unknowns. And for the most part the number of people interested in such extreme security in principle is limited.

Butterfly Labs made an FPGA miner for a period before transitioning into ASICs. It was one reason why people started out with such confidence in them, as they had a track record, which they slowly eroded with their trademark "in 2 weeks" marketing slogan. Another early FPGA miner was the one (forget name now) from the guy who later made the Avalon chips/miners (in China). Pictures on google, search "fpga miner", many available, here's a sample of the pre-Avalon one (I think).
FPGAs are available off the shelf and can range in price from $1-2 up to hundreds of $$ each depending on density and technology, speed and special functions. You can get one cheaply and develop for it with free tools, whereas with an ASIC you pretty much have to hire professionals, at high cost, and pay for a specialized fab facility to make them for you and the process takes months (at least).

***(reposting this info here since it seems comment I replied to was deleted and I think it's important)***
There are a couple ways to secure yourself.
With any script, whether simple wallet gen or full wallet, you have to either check the source code yourself or rely on others who have checked it for you. I would suggest not using any script/wallet that has not been well reviewed by the community and stood the test of time (assuming you can't read the source code and confirm for yourself). 
I have been using Electrum for 8 years, have read the code, even contributed to development, and have a high trust level with that software. Others might use it because they heard it was well respected and safe.
The other thing you can do is use your own entropy as source for any private keys or seeds, and then reply on the simplest tools. This is actually good advice if you are worried about false randomness spoiling keys. For seeds you can use a [BIP39 dice chart]( to convert directly from roll values to seed words.
For dice to private key conversion you can use simple open source sha256 and format conversion tools that are short enough to check for any malicious code. The  most common generic sha256 tool is probably "openssl" as it's widely used and well tested. You roll dice and enter the rolls as data to be hashed. The output is a 256 bit value which can be used as a private key (random due to dice). You then just need to trust conversion code to get it in WIF (base58) format. 
I have a conversion tool written in python [I wrote myself]( years ago. It is short enough to read (100 lines) and make sure it is not doing anything weird. The info there even shows how to use the system to generate random input but dice will work too (even better). 
If you want my suggestion for safest way for an average guy to not trust any code or company: 
1. roll dice and use [BIP39 diceware]( word chart to make a seed. 
2. write it down keep it safe. make a [metal backup](
3. restore seed on offline Electrum or a hardware wallet to use it. I prefer [Trezor]( because **everything** is open source, even the hardware (you can even make your own with some electronics skills).
For privacy, run your own node and [EPS]( with Electrum and Trezor. That is exactly what I do.
Stay away from random unknown web pages that offer to make your keys.

You could try the [iancoleman]( site. But copy it to an offline system first. It allows trying many different settings with BIP39 seeds like accounts, derivation paths etc. It's like a swiss army knife for seeds. You can play with values until you get an address you recognize.

It should work for any variant of a Mycelium seed and you can change account # and see what the addresses are.

That's called a double spend and as long as the first tx is in the mempool the second one will be rejected. You'd have to do that double spend within seconds of the first and broadcast it to different nodes not connected to the first one. ie. it's doable with or without RBF, which has no bearing on double spending, and hard enough to do that it requires a lot of setup and knowledge to pull off. And then most merchants that accept zero-conf txs would be setup to detect double spends. And anyone not accepting zero-conf would not be affected. So in short - that's all baloney meant to confuse noob users.

No. He means buying BTC from an exchange and sending to the  address in their wallet - which is actually a BCH wallet. Now the Bitcoin are sitting on a BTC address and do not show in his wallet. So he complains to the exchange and they say "we sent it and here is tx id". So they check that and it's there but guess what - it's not in their wallet so they think it's failed, lost gone! 
Or this happens the other way around where you pay someone and they say you didn't because the BCH didn't show up in their BTC wallet. Maybe everything gets sorted out with some expert help, creating a new with same keys or maybe they all call each other scammers and give up. It's easy to see how this will cause a lot of headaches - MUCH more than some high fees now and then.
This gets even more serious when the destination wallet is an exchange or business that can rightfully claim you never paid and then you cannot get a refund because they have no intention of creating a BCH wallet just to find missing BTC. There will be so much flack from that kind of screw up.

If you have Electrum installed (not as an Appimage or binary but as source from github, and installed) then you can just run it like `python3 find_seed.py` (assuming that is filename you saved it to). 
To be honest it's probably a bit much to do without some basic background in installing and using python. It's easier in Linux (python already installed) and I can be more help there than in Windows. If you already created a Linux usb for using Electrum then it's not much more after that.

Adding to old comment, I came across a paper on PBKDF2 speeds. 
It is using SHA1 (seems sha512 about half speed) and only 1000 iteration count and  gets best case approx. 1700 pwd/s on CPU and 1710 Kpwd/s GPU (hashcat). I'd guess then that BIP39 would be roughly 4x slower, or best case about 400 KH/s given a fairly high end GPU. I have not yet seen any info on EC multiply speeds on GPU. I'd expect it may benefit similarly at 1000x increase perhaps. The final address lookup probably still needs to be done on CPU and in-memory utxo tree.

Seems it may be possible to gain perhaps 100x speed increase.

That works too as long as your home port is forwarded or exposed on the internet. I prefer to keep my home closed. I'm not sure why you say not encrypted. I don't see a flag to disable that and by default ssh always encrypts forwarded traffic. Your -L is the same as my -R but in direction of opening the tunnel. 
The socks is for outgoing connections. In your case any bitcoind outgoing connections are made from your home IP. Part of the intent was to not expose the home IP on the bitcoin network. I personally don't bother but if you want to be undetected then it would be needed (or use a VPN).
BTW for your method it also requires your home system to be running sshd server. That's hardly different than not running a home ssh command. It requires an open port whether the usual port 22 or some alternate one. Mine requires no sshd server at home and you likely already run one on the remote server, or at least I do as I do all my admin that way. No panel.

If we are talking about brute forcing BIP39 seeds then the passphrase adds as much as the entropy it contains because every guess of (seed) vs. (seed+passphrase) requires the same work. When not provided the passphrase of "" (empty string) is used. Each iteration requires 2048 rounds of PBKDF2 with HMAC of SHA512. This is enough to add a reasonable slow down. 
~~You can reduce the seed work by 256 (with a 24 word seed) because the chksum calculation is faster but with a passphrase you have no further reduction.~~ Each passphrase requires the full work.
Plus if you avoid using the first N addresses then any brute force would need to check at least that many before detecting the wallet. While the EC Pt multiply for each address is pretty fast it still requires some form of utxo lookup on each address. All of this makes brute forcing seeds quite a bit slower than, say, AES encrypted data.
edit - added strikeout for part I think is wrong after some thought, chksum is additional 8 bits not included in 256 bits entropy.
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:32:32
What's more interesting is if there is a way to show that key generation can repeat a key as that would indicate a loop. After that it would generate the same limited number of keys over and over. 
Barring that, a seed can generate all keys - unlimited, given enough time and energy.

@_date: 2019-06-12 02:48:01
Yes, but brute forcing the passphrase requires checking the seed+passphrase combo and checking addresses for balance. That means it's fairly slow (PBKDF2 + several EC multiply, lookups). It's the same as brute forcing seeds themselves. You cannot brute force only the passphrase. 
You still need a decent passphrase but not as long as with eg. simple AES encryption or linux logins. I would suggest random 6 words or more from good sized dictionary or maybe 10 chars if using upper/lower/digit/special chars. Also, by not using the first few addresses you make it less likely to ever be detected even if someone was brute forcing the seed (they likely check only a few as each check requires EC multiplies, which are slow). 
If you choose a passphrase similar to 12 bip39 words entropy (~80 bits) or 6 dictionary words, then the brute force difficulty is similar to one half your 24 word seed being exposed. I posted some figures [here]( a few days ago.

I believe the wallet.dat file uses AES encryption which is probably easy to run on this or other GPU based solutions.

A year ago I helped someone find a missing word for a seed and recover their wallet with $18,000 assumed lost. I wrote a very small script to try possible words and found the correct one in a few seconds. 
The script uses Electrum and should only ever be run on an offline system. I include it here in case it helps you or others as a start point for quickly finding word errors. It won't help for any real brute force as it's just too slow. 
It may help if you know how to use and adapt for a simple missing/wrong word situation rather than having to go to some third party. 
Note in my case it was a 2FA wallet but I added a couple lines for BIP39 instead and checked it still works ok. Try it with 23 of known words and it will find all words in any position for the remaining ones that make a valid seed. Or adapt to suit.
     /usr/bin/env python3
    #
    #   check all seeds for valid when one word unknown
    #
    
    from electrum.mnemonic import load_wordlist
    from electrum.keystore import bip39_is_checksum_valid
    
    # example 11 word partial seed to test
    known = 'balance friend witness world next tube valley force leisure essay border'.split()
    
    words = load_wordlist('english.txt')
    
    for w in words:
        for n in range(0,12):  # chg 12 to target size of seed
            chk = known[:n]+[w]+known[n:]
            is_checksum,_ = bip39_is_checksum_valid(' '.join(chk))
            if is_checksum:
                print("Found valid seed: "+' '.join(chk))

I can give you a short python script that can check your words in all orders for checksum and print out the ones that validate. But it's only useful if you can setup an offline system with Electrum because it uses some routines from it's modules for the checksum. If you think you have the time and chops to do that I'll do it to help out. It requires modifying my script since it currently does something a little different (checking all variants when a word is missing). I originally wrote it to recover btc for a client and it did work well. If you aren't able to use then I won't bother as it's likely 20-30 minutes to change and test.

Solo mining is pretty much impossible now without a huge investment to gain a substantial hash rate. The whole thing is statistical in nature and a pool makes the probability workable for small miners. 
You can figure out the odds of finding a block solo mining. Lets say you have 10 miners at 13 TH/s - that's 130 TH/s. The current total hash rate is ~64,000,000 TH/s. So you have a 1 in 492308 chance of finding a block. Given an average of ten min/block you can expect to mine for 3418 days before finding a block on average. It could be less or it could be 3 times longer, ie. never in your life. Meanwhile you are paying for electricity.
Now compare that to mining for a pool where you get a percent share of every block the pool mines. If the pool is 1000x higher total hash rate then that's some income every 3 days. Reducing variability means steady income instead of a crap shoot where you quite likely never even get paid.

Another issue is that for small business it forces them into using co-located hardware because paying for such large storage on VPS or dedicated servers gets prohibitive quickly.

I think it's pretty similar. I don't use that "Bitcoin wallet" but it's been around a long while and well known. It's too bad it has such a generic name as it makes it hard to know what people are referring to. I thought you were initially talking about the bitcoin core node client but I see now you are talking about Android only. 
From what I recall the Android Bitcoin wallet does provide a way to connect to your own full node (via port 8333). If that is true then it's pretty much the same as using EPS with Electrum in regards to privacy. 
You only want to connect to your own node, or one you explicitly know and trust. Any random node could as likely be run by blockchain tracking/analysis companies or malicious actors so should not be trusted. You probably only risk privacy by using random nodes, but possibly there is other ways it could affect you.

No. It doesn't because while you may want to have two wallets in one the business you pay tomorrow very likely does not. They may simply say "Never paid, Not shipping. Bye!".

Exchanges have an order book made up of bids and asks. Those are buyers/sellers wanting to trade. A bid is someone offering to buy. An ask is someone offering to sell. When a bid matches an ask then a trade occurs but those bids and asks are canceled by the trade and only the others on the order book remain. The price is the last trade but the next trade is determined by the orders remaining or newly posted. It may be higher or lower depending on the flow of bids and asks happening. 
More buyers need btc they can't get - they raise their bid. More sellers want to sell but can't - they lower their ask. At some point the two match and a trade occurs. This is how all markets work - even the ones that are super slow, like at your supermarket. When something doesn't sell at the asking price it gets discounted to move at some lower price. 
With Bitcoin, trading is spread across hundreds of small markets around the world, each having similar basic qualities. A lot of trading is between these markets (called "arbitrage") which keeps them fairly closely tied. Traders buy where the price is a bit lower and sell where it's a bit higher and that closes the any gap between exchanges around the world.

I've developed an Electrum server that I'm currently testing on my full node. The main advantages are reduced space and sync time.

There are a couple ways to secure yourself.
With any script, whether simple wallet gen or full wallet, you have to either check the source code yourself or rely on others who have checked it for you. I would suggest not using any script/wallet that has not been well reviewed by the community and stood the test of time (assuming you can't read the source code and confirm for yourself). 
I have been using Electrum for 8 years, have read the code, even contributed to development, and have a high trust level with that software. Others might use it because they heard it was well respected and safe.
The other thing you can do is use your own entropy as source for any private keys or seeds, and then reply on the simplest tools. This is actually good advice if you are worried about false randomness spoiling keys. For seeds you can use a [BIP39 dice chart]( to convert directly from roll values to seed words.
For dice to private key conversion you can use simple open source sha256 and format conversion tools that are short enough to check for any malicious code. The  most common generic sha256 tool is probably "openssl" as it's widely used and well tested. You roll dice and enter the rolls as data to be hashed. The output is a 256 bit value which can be used as a private key (random due to dice). You then just need to trust conversion code to get it in WIF (base58) format. 
I have a conversion tool written in python [I wrote myself]( years ago. It is short enough to read (100 lines) and make sure it is not doing anything weird. The info there even shows how to use the system to generate random input but dice will work too (even better). 
If you want my suggestion for safest way for an average guy to not trust any code or company: 
1. roll dice and use [BIP39 diceware]( word chart to make a seed. 
2. write it down keep it safe. make a [metal backup](
3. restore seed on offline Electrum or a hardware wallet to use it. I prefer [Trezor]( because **everything** is open source, even the hardware (you can even make your own with some electronics skills).
For privacy, run your own node and [EPS]( with Electrum and Trezor. That is exactly what I do.
Stay away from random unknown web pages that offer to make your keys.

From my interaction with ThomasV I think Electrum will stay native only because he feels it is the best way to reduce network congestion and fees. BIP39 will maintain compatibility with hardware wallets so if Trezor/Ledger support bech32/native then I expect Electrum will as well but probably not before then.
I don't think native Electrum follows the same derivation path methodolgy as BIP39 but to be sure I'd have to dig into the code to see. I suspect it's probably not a hard hack to make native segwit with BIP39 work but until there is industry hardware wallet consensus on how to do it, independent hacks may not be compatible.

That's all gibberish because miners use dedicated ASIC SHA256 double hashers that cannot do anything at all except that. It's nothing at all do to with "security by obscurity", you simply cannot do PKBDF2 nor SHA512 on mining equipment and even on GPUs at nowhere near that rate. And to top it off to be cracking at all you still need to do EC Pt multiply and RIPEMD hashes for every address and then "lookup" every generated address in a utxo table to detect if the address has any balance. It is nowhere near the same as miners hashing; many, many orders of magnitude slower.You have no idea what you're talking about.
@_date: 2015-08-04 01:51:41
Even if you have 95% of the hashrate, if you mine invalid blocks they do not get relayed. And changing the reward would make a block invalid. Hash rate only matters if the block is valid and it's validity is determined by the network as a whole. A miner cannot force the network to have a higher reward no matter how high it's hash rate.

Hey, but if they ran their own servers it may be harder to claim "hacked" when they exit scam.
Seriously though, any decent exchange should have their own servers in a  locked cage or premises. There was an exchange years ago running on a popular vps provider (sorry can't recall which now but was very well known) and they got hacked. Many figured it was likely an admin at the vps provider but who knows. On a third party server you literally never know who is poking around in the system.

I don't know of a service for that. You could script it fairly easily using bitcoind or electrum (if you don't want to run a full node) and then add it to cron for regular checking. With electrum, since it's HD, the sweep to addresses can always be fresh ones in your wallet.

I think it stands for mining or AES but based on those numbers privkeys vs seeds is not much different. I'm not very sure of those numbers.

To be accurate you'd need to use fastest available implementations of each. It would be a lot more work than I'm ready to undertake.

I use a raspberry pi too. I have one uSD for Kodi (TV media center) and another for minimal rasbian desktop with Electrum. When you disconnect and swap uSD cards it's a whole new clean system. Just add keyboard. The Electrum system is never connected except for initial install. And the only added cost is one uSD card.
If you add a [camera module]( (or usb webcam) then you can sign txs without even using a usb stick, which some people think is also corruptible. Electrum supports QR code tx signing and if systems aren't conveniently placed you can use a mobile phone as snapshot intermediary. Faster also.

It's not the devs who decide this. People choose to run software and by that choice select what rules they follow. Sure, devs may write code and offer options but there are always other devs who can write other code. The supply limit is the result of the reward per block and the fact it halves every 4 years. If the majority decided tomorrow to run software that accepted higher reward or didn't halve the same time period, then we'd all be accepting a higher limit. You can go to github and clone bitcoin and change these values yourself and compile your own copy that accepts higher values. It won't change the system until **most** users do likewise.

That's not a 0-conf tx. It's either no tx at all or a sweep because they can't leave it on the paper wallet. I suspect they'd sweep it which means it still ends up on the blockchain. So it's a dumb idea but not for the 0-conf reason; for the "no way I'm trusting this key hasn't been copied" reason.

It's reasonably safe for smallish amounts. It's not super secure but is likely better than using a Windows desktop. I'd suggest if amount is over what you'd keep in your regular pants wallet then not safe enough.

As long as the premium is consistent for selling as well as buying it doesn't really matter. It's not like you can sell GBTC for actual BTC and would lose the premium. That's why I'd be looking at historic premium trends to see if you can discount it's significance. Now I'd be worried that eventually Fidelity coming online (for smaller investors rather than special cases) could impact the premium on GBTC as it loses preference. Have you already looked into Fidelity as an alternative? I'm pretty sure it's not there yet but they are potentially competing in that "staid broker" market.

If you don't want to spend the money for a hardware wallet then you have two other offline safe options. Use a clean bootable USB stick Linux OS and create your wallet and only boot and use when disconnected from the net. Or, do the same using a raspberry pi or old laptop, system that once installed and setup never again connects online. Barring some pretty far fetched and unlikely scenarios a system that nevers connects online has no chance to send your BTC away.

No. To push the averge higher you actually have to pay a fee higher than the average, higher than most others are already. So the real problem is that some wallets over pay. They pay 600 when 350 would have worked fine. And when many do that then some have to pay more to get ahead of them. Things cycle up and up. 
The only way this can be an attack is if you are paying yourself - if you are a miner in cahoots with other miners in a deal where you all agree to settle each other fees and balance out to zero. If a large chunk did that they could send high fee txs and recoup the cost, while pushing everyone else up too. Is that happening? I haven't seen any evidence yet. But maybe something like that could happen.

Oh, I'd agree with that. And it would be nice to see more of the P2WPKH than the P2WPKH-P2SH variant. Electrum is leading the way there by offering native wallets. And what we need now is either some compatibility address conversion options or every other wallet and exchange to get on with native addresses. I don't think it's very hard if they are doing Segwit to tweak it for native or both types. Looks like we need both because BIP39 wallets seem to be defaulting towards wrapped addresses (for now anyway).

I tried this out but could not find the correct way to make a BIP39-multsig-segwit. It won't accept the normal (non-multisig) m/49' as derivation and doing it with m/44' creates a non-multsig p2sh (not p2wsh). I'm missing something and looked around for the correct way to create p2wsh-p2sh wallets and could not find any BIPs or info. I'm baffled for now. Presumably Trezor/Ledger must be doing it somehow or are they not doing segwit-multisig? Hmmm.

The block times are set by the miner who need not be using accurate clocks. Some blocks are even out of time order as that is not used as criteria for valid blocks and ordering. Basically the timestamp in Bitcoin is not important and has a wide allowed variability range. I think it's something like a couple hours allowed to be off. Also, the received time is not part of the tx format so it's meta data added by any software on top of the node. The block does have a timestamp in the format but it's not required to be accurate.
Maybe [this]( is a better explanation.

When creating the wallet you will write down a **12 word seed** as master backup. Put it safely in multiple places (if the value is high). Anyone getting that seed can restore the wallet and take the btc, so keep it safe and private. You can use it on any system any time to restore the wallet and sign a tx. You don't even need to keep the usb stick around after creating the wallet as you could make a new one later and restore the seed. For HD wallets like Electrum the seed is everything.
As long as your usb stick is disconnected before you create the wallet and it never connects again it is extremely unlikely any infection on it could do anything with your seed. Don't plug it into another running system. Always disconnect and cold boot from the usb stick only. The offline system would have to find some way to send data without being connected. It's possible to imagine ways but they start to get into the realm of super-tin-foil-hat theories. Are the NSA outside in a van with highly sensitive receivers focused on you picking up your cpu signals?
It is also fairly easy to encrypt your seed words but then they're not so easy to write down and probably need to be stored on a usb stick. Pros and cons to both approaches but human readable words on paper seem like the best long term plan to me as long as you can keep them from prying eyes.

The data that makes up the transaction (including input reference, output addresses and amounts) is signed by the private key. Then both the signature and public key are added to each transaction input so that it can be verified. The signature must be valid and the public keys must hash to the addresses used as input. This is done for each input to a transaction.
btw the hashing isn't obfuscation. If it were you would gain by knowing how it's done and could reverse it. With hashing the pubkey to address it cannot easily be reversed, so isn't simply obfuscation, though it may appear as only that to casual users.

I've thought about this myself from an FPGA engineering standpoint as I do work in this area. I have the tools but have not pursued it to actually writing code. I think it's quite feasible to create an FPGA circuit that can mimic the Trezor cpu as far as accepting an updated firmware and giving correct results to screen and usb confirmation, but then switch to a malicious behavior for actual seed generation. The reason this is relevant is that it would not be hard to place an FPGA under the screen on otherwise normal looking pcb. They cover the cpu chip with a qr code so it need not even be the somewhat costly original cpu soldered in place. An FPGA is nice because you can do a lot of funky cool stuff without fancy dev tools, licensing and are very generic to buy. 
So basically I'm saying it's not hard for a technically competent person to subvert at a circuit level. Probably a bit harder to fake the case and packaging.

Too complex to remember or pass on to family so most likely failure is inability to recover. Using a OTP is pretty close to using a good passphrase. If someone gets your pad wallet then the work required to brute force the shifted wallets is very close to the same as just brute forcing a passphrase on the pad wallet. Each iteration of passphrase is the same as each iteration of OTP. A passphrase is only poor to the extent it has less entropy than the OTP.
I personally wouldn't trust any safe deposit box at all. Since I'm not concerned about recovery by family I just use a medium difficulty but memorable passphrase on the seed and store the seed encoded as dots in metal, well hidden.

Yes, things have changed. The network has become more congested and your fee pays for "space" (actual byte size) on the blockchain in competition with others, and the price has risen so much that even small btc amounts like you used to pay are worth a lot more now.
If you want to "play" with it to get familiar I'd suggest installing Electrum on your desktop and starting it with the `--testnet` option. That gets you onto the test version and you can get free test coins (tbtc) and do as many txs of any type between wallets as you like. Other wallets may support testnet as well but I don't know about breadwallet. Free tbtc faucet:  
Testnet is primarily used by developers to test code without risking real btc.

I don't much care for the taint coin approach due to the wait and dependence on B2X miners. What if they hold their coinbase coins tight?
It seems to me an nLockTime method doing a split to your own wallet (on BTC side) should be safe. If a re-org occurs your BTC at worst will still be in your wallet, and as a bonus you may sell your B2X and end up with them back again, which I don't feel too bad about as it damages that chain's reputation.
ps. I did read the comments mentioned and they helped form my opinion on the taint.

Until the owner sends his BCH to a Segwit address (unbkownst to him) and that's it - funds gone poof. Sucker. 
And if he sends it to a BTC address he is dependent on the receiver having to go create a new wallet to recover the BCH funds. I know that many will simple say "Never arrived, not shipping". 
It's like sending the wrong currency to the wrong bank and then expecting some business to go find it for you. Ha ha ha. Sucker.

It's my understanding from reading BIP143/173 that every bech32 address can be represented as a 3xxx address. I think the tx has to be unpacked differently but Electrum can already do that for BIP39 wallets. So it should be feasible to have a wallet option to select whether you want either address type and/or right click convert type to give out to payors. I have not heard anything about whether this is valid and if Electrum devs could add that feature but if it's true then it would go miles to helping with compatibility for Electrum users (like me) who really want to use native Segwit. 
Anyone with deep address tech knowledge able to verify address mapping conversion and/or why we cannot have that option? I'm keen to have a native segwit wallet if I'm still able to hand out 3xxx (p2wpkh-p2sh) addresses.

No. That is an added fee charged by BitPay to make BCH seem like a better currency because they backed BCH and got burned by Seg2X failing. Think, man. You add the miner fee when creating the tx. BitPay adds another fee to the bill before you even pay it.

BIP38 is a standard for encrypting a private key. You always start by generating a private key and then using BIP38 to encrypt it. So nothing you said sounds wrong or abnormal. The public key and address derived from it is not encrypted anyway. When you decrypt a BIP38 key you get a private key which can be used normally. 
Some wallet generators are untrustworthy. I don't know what you used but any tool for that needs to be used offline (on a computer not connected to the internet). Never generate private keys on a web site and never enter a private key (BIP or not) into a website. You have no way of easily confirming they aren't stealing your key.
Besides all that using single private keys on paper is less than ideal now. It's better to generate a seed word list offline and use that as your wallet.

Mostly yes. You won't be able to just drag the bitaddress.org html file onto the usb stick because it won't be "visible" once you boot on it. Just save the bitaddress page onto some other clean usb stick and then after booting you can plug it in and open. 
The main security of a clean offline boot is that it won't get access to the net **again** later. If it ever does then any malware present can "call home". So actually you can withstand one single net connection after booting for doing updates, installs, page saves etc. But after that disconnect, and once you do any sensitive work like making a wallet or keys, it must never see the net again.

As long as you've fully done the calculations, know that hash rate will climb and if it works for you then go for it. A lot of people jump in without knowing what's going on and find out later they were clueless. I'd suggest using a good mining calculator that lets you project future hash rate increase as percent and maybe price changes. Run through several scenarios and print out if you can to compare. I haven't mined for years because it just became too capital intensive and more risky. Don't expect high margins because as the price goes up it becomes more profitable only briefly as the hash rate goes up due to more people getting in or expanding.

In the meantime you should learn how to use Electrum offline as [cold storage]( It's almost free (usb stick) and just as safe as hw wallet but not as easy/convenient.

In Electrum (2 of 3) each signor wallet will contain one seed and 2 mpk. So each user should store those, either as a file backup, or manually on paper in order to restore the wallet. The mpk is maybe most easily stored on paper as a QR code (saving as png and printing perhaps). Admittedly more effort than just writing down words but not so hard either. More reliable and easier to restore.
Regarding splitting seed words: it's generally thought better to use multisig (more flexibility) but in the specific case of 2 of 2 with 2x12 word parts IMO it's not outright a bad idea. Each 12 word part is very secure on it's own. It's easy; easier than multisig. 
Multisig is more flexible if the wallet will be active because each signor can create/sign txs without having to get together to combine seeds and restore. Split words falls short except in the situation where the wallet will never be used (your case).
But when you move beyond 2 of 2 then splitting words becomes increasingly dubious. eg. 2 of 3 requires 3 users each with 16 word groups and then each user only has 8 words to brute force, or about 80 (88-8 chksum) bits entropy. Same for anyone finding one word set. For 3 of 3 it's quite a bit better at 8 words each but you cannot withstand one person vanishing or losing data as you would with multisig.
Even though it's a bit more hassle I would tend towards 2 of 3 multisig myself. But for the simplest approach for 2 of 2 and non technical will executors I can see the merit in split word lists.

@_date: 2019-06-15 23:04:42
When you receive btc it is an "output" from a transaction. When you spend that output it becomes an "input" to a new transaction. The protocol has no defaults itself but most wallets will usually create two outputs from a transaction you make. One to pay who you choose and one returning excess to your own wallet on a new address. The latter is called a "change" output, just like in a store when you pay a $4.34 item with a $5 bill. 
Change occurs because "outputs" cannot be partially spent. You use them as a whole and when not sufficient amount you combine multiple outputs (as inputs) in a transaction. When an output has not been spent yet it is called an "unspent transaction output" (utxo). All the utxo in your wallet add up to your wallet balance. Some wallets call these utxos "coins", which makes sense as they are like metal coins you can add together to spend but cannot cut in half and spend.
The difference between the total inputs and total outputs of a transaction is the fee collected by miners. This is determined by the wallet when it calculates how much change is returned to your wallet.
A transaction can have any number of inputs and outputs (within some block size limits). Those with many outputs are often called "batched" transactions and are commonly used by exchanges to pay out withdraws, or often for pool miner payouts. A coinjoin transaction is another example of one with many inputs and many outputs whose purpose is to obfuscate wallet ownership assumptions. The inputs and outputs are from different user's wallets and a protocol is used to co-ordinate building the transaction.
Some wallets, eg. Electrum, allow building transactions with many outputs. You can provide a list of (address,amount) pairs and it will build one paying all those plus a change output back to you. This saves fees over paying many separate transactions because fees are generally based on transaction byte size ("weight").
edit - fixed batched tx description.

The most important factor is the password length, whether it's totally random or made up of tokens/words you may have chosen. By random I mean generated by a pwd generator designed for that, not random like you pulled chars from the ceiling. The latter is much easier to crack, the former requires brute force. If you chose words or bits of data from your world (birthdate, friends name, fave food, numbers) etc. then you can cut down the search space immensely. You can give an extensive word list of everything you've ever been involved in or thought of to the cracker and it will have much less work ahead than brute force. If it really is true random then the longer it is, the worse off you are (obviously) and if it's truly 26+ chars then goodbye, you're just gambling on poor odds. If it's possibly shorter then you can knock them off pretty quick and get up to maybe 12-15 chars and have some decent chances maybe worth paying for.

sorry - quick check indicates it was AES-256 with multiple rounds of SHA-512 hashed pwd. So each test would require both those processes, which is pretty fast on current machines. At least they didn't harden it with PBKDF2 or something as that would make it much slower. I guess the number of rounds was stored in the file and the faster your CPU back then the more it used.

You cannot detect Segwit when you send. It is a hash of a script which isn't revealed until it is spent from, like all P2SH addresses. So BCH users will have to forgoe all P2SH addresses for fear of loss. Hence, Multisig is effective disabled on BCH. They may have to do a soft/hard fork to change the P2SH prefix for BCH so they can continue using P2SH without fear.

Revenue depends on difficulty as well as price. Whe BCH difficulty adjusted downwards miners started mining that coin instead of BTC because it was more profitable - lower price but more blocks due to lower difficulty. With BCH price rising it became even more profitable. The price pump on BCH was an attempt to keep miners on that coin but it could not be maintained. After all, you need to keep buying to pump the price up. So when the BCH difficulty adjusted upward again (because they have stupid adjustment code) it suddenly became less profitable on the BCH chain and miners once again moved back to BTC to mine. That not only chews through tx backlog but also helps restore confidence that BTC is supreme and BCH was just a pumped up attack on BTC. With restored confidence the BTC price is rising and becoming even more profitable for miners, making it even harder to attack. BCH are going to be hard forking again in 2 days to try and fix their difficulty adjustment problems.

I have a BIP38 tool I wrote years ago and altered it to mimic the buggy bippy by forcing uncompressed on decrypt and disabling the chksum test. So like yours it returns the correct WIF key for OPs BIP38 example. He's lucky the error didn't mess with actual aes/scrypt bytes.

Ok. I'm unclear where your btc are verified to reside. Are they on the address that's part of the Mycelium wallet? You say they were moved from the Electrum wallet to Mycelium. 
Electrum has 12 word proprietary (non-BIP39) seeds. Mycelium has 24 word BIP39 seeds. If you have 12 words then it's not the Mycelium wallet. You'll need to locate the seed words for that wallet. You can restore a Mycelium seed on Electrum but it would be 24 words, BIP39 only.

Spot instances are good because much cheaper. You can get booted off with little warning if someone else demands instances (at higher price). If you make an AMI (image of your config'd system) then you have a custom cracking image and can use the control panel to set a spot request for a given bid price and it will keep some given number of instances running. They'll start up when the bid is low and shut down when outbid. To do that you need some way to save state like a small EBS disk mounted which keeps data even when the instance is shut down, so that when it starts again it continues on. Hashcat has some options for splitting work over networked instances as well.

Running a full node is great but if all you want to do is look address balances why don't you just use Electrum. It needs no "power" and very little disk space.
But anyway you can run a full node on a raspberry pi 3 so I highly doubt that any amd/linux/windows issues have bearing on running one. Maybe you're actually talking about mining? In which case just don't even bother with any GPU at this time. The days of GPU mining ended 4 years ago, and now will only waste your money.

Coinbase Commerce actually uses an xpub to direct pmts to your own wallet. Well, unless they've changed since I last checked. I was curious last fall as the company I bought my Trezor from was using it. At that time you signed up with only an email, no coinbase account required, and provided an xpub for pmts to go to your own wallet.
Other than some privacy loss it seems like an easy but decent way of accepting btc. Certainly a big step up over Bitpay. No fees either.

So a bot buys btc repeatedly pushing the price up. And the btc are taken from customer accounts but actual fiat doesn't exist, except on their account screens. So following that sequence everyone has difficulty withdrawing fiat blamed on bank issues, and whatever, because actually the fiat never existed. But Mark has all that real btc which he can sell off or lose some other way. Perhaps his intention was to drive the price up and sell to profit and replace fiat funds, at lower cost, freeing up withdrawls again. But then the US govt seized funds, or expected momentum didn't happen and he was left puttzing around trying to fix things.
edit - So essentially he created a reverse ponzi where the bag holder is the person holding fiat on MtGox. People came to MtGox to sell for the higher price but when they couldn't get their fiat they would be forced to buy btc instead, forcing the price higher, and passing the fake fiat onto other buyers. In the end whoever held sold for the highest price was left holding fake fiat and couldn't never withdraw.

I don't think it makes much sense to do unless you have some scenario where it helps you, eg. testing pruning or some other functionality. You can also use the -connect option to force one to only connect to the other one so it won't double the network load.

The problem is that in order to buy post-fork mined B2X dust you'll have to wait at least 100 blocks. It may be by then the price has been pushed low by those willing to use nTimeLock instead. It sounds like there may be some chain re-org risk but if you split to your own wallet before selling B2X then I think that should be averted.

If you own the unspent output address (39Lj...) then you can bump the fee by creating a CPFP tx. It means paying a higher fee for both this tx and the new one you create. What wallet software?

Hey there. I managed to mimic the bippy code by introducing errors into my own code. I can reverse the BIP38 key `6PYMN8WT4CW7xLYczLvYfXZCtQWND7XEesk32QbXujMgKhf2v5A2ZQANpL` you provide above to get the input WIF key  `5Ka1Bv4RpKayZygPhZbBcREejqeYwq2iSRzWPKsg49SPgVRTnpW` you used.
This leads me to believe if you used my "buggy" version of keyfmt with your own BIP38 key you should get back your original key.
The problem is that bippy always encodes as if compressed even if not, but always decrypts as uncompressed. But it sees the error in the address hash and barfs. So I skip the addr chksum verify with uncompressed forced and it returns a key that should be wrong but is in fact correct. Geez. 
If you are still working on this then pm me and I will give you the bad keyfmt script to run. It's very short so you can check it in a minute for any bad stuff.
If you want proof - give me another BIP38 key that's bad without WIF and I'll give you back the WIF you used to check.
edit - oh damn. I see fpgaminer beat me to it. Well, he's amazing so I guess I shouldn't be too miffed. Getting it within an hour of the master is something.

Miner revenue depends on more than just the reward amount. It depends on price, which is tied directly to scarcity, and it's tied to difficulty, which adjusts according to hash rate. If miners start mining blocks that aren't accepted by other nodes then they will soon find themselves on their own. If the reward+fees isn't high enough then they will be forced to turn off, or operate at a loss, as we were back in the fall of 2011.
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:39:54
Wouldn't that be a mistake? Not the selling but moving BTC to an exchange. Then you are dependent on the exchange for splitting the BTC and they may not do that for weeks. I've not followed GDAX but you should at least verify any statements about post-fork split delay. Even if they say they will split right after the fork you are still trusting them to follow through and not have "issues". The safe bet most have been taking is to have control of your BTC so that you can split them right away and send the B2X to an exchange to sell. 
I haven't heard that Coinbase has even split BCC coins yet from Aug. 1st. They said it would be in the new year.

I just saw your other post where you mention why you want to do this. I would add that using new addresses is still preferable for privacy and not hard to do even with a Trezor.
Your Trezor software (or Electrum) can show you a master public key (xpub, ypub, zpub depending on address type). You can use that to create a watch only wallet on a phone or laptop/desktop that can be used to monitor and create new addresses as needed. This watch-only wallet does not need access to the Trezor to work and cannot spend. 
In fact, with Electrum when the Trezor is unplugged it works normally using this master pub key for all aspects except spending. Other apps like Mycelium also have this watch-only mode I believe. Certainly Electrum Android does. 
With this type of wallet there is no real reason to re-use an address for deposits. It's not a huge deal but this does provide better privacy.

Since any key is as probable as another there is no point in re-testing because you will never test them all anyway. Not even the tiniest fraction.
The highest probability of success is to test as many as possible in any time period. It's faster to generate keys than read them from disk. Ideally all addresses currently holding a value should be loaded in memory and then as many keys should be tested against those. There are about 786,000 addresses with &gt;= 0.1 btc, so that's only about 16MB of (sorted) lookup table memory.
Not that even the fastest hardware could even make the slightest impact. Just the other day in response to a post I calculated that the entire mining hashrate right now turned to address mining (which it can't do) would take 14 million years for a 50% chance of finding a single key.

Well, it does and doesn't. You can't create a BIP39 but you can restore one. So you have to create it elsewhere, which isn't hard. And just to be nutty the only way to get a widely compatible Segwit wallet in Electrum is by using BIP39 instead of the native type. !!?!!
But the main good and best thing with Electrum is you can create an offline wallet and do offline signing for txs created in your watch-only wallet. That is zero cost and very near hardware wallet security.

The current proposal is for aggregating multisig txs (reducing the signatures required on chain for this), and not for aggregating signatures from multiple inputs, or multiple txs.

BitPay charges a network fee ON TOP of the miner fee you will pay when sending the tx. Think about it. They cannot charge you the miner fee because you need to add it in your allet when your tx is created or the miner won't get it. That $2 fee shown is a fee they add on top of the vendor charge as part of the final bill. BCH doesn't have that fee because BitPay have long been supported of BCH from the time of the Seg2X failure.

Oh, you need to provide the options each time unless you set them in a config file. Not sure where the config file is on Mac but on Linux it's in the home electrum directory which is `~/.electrum`. If you go there and see a file called `config` then it's possible to edit that and add the options so you never need to pass on command line. It would be something like adding/editing these lines in file (with your own ip obviously, or localhost if on same system):
    "oneserver": true,
    "server": "192.168.0.1:50002:s",

So, you mean without coding? Then you would install software that gives you a view of the data. The bitcoin-qt node is meant for operating a wallet so it only presents the data for your wallet. But you can install explorer software on your node that gives you an explorer type view of the data. That doesn't require coding but you need to be able to install software. It typically takes a lot more disk space as well due to indexing. There are several programs around for that, [one]( of which I wrote.

In Electrum you have to create a new wallet to get Segwit. It is an option during the creation steps. But wait, there's more.
If you create a normal Electrum wallet and choose Segwit then it will be a "native" Segwit wallet using bech32 addresses. These are not yet supported by other exchanges/wallets so at this time only another Electrum wallet can send to this type of wallet. You may want to hold off, or if you still want to help Segwit become the norm and save a bit on fees while at it then wait, there's more.
If you create a BIP39 seed in another wallet or tool then you can restore it in Electrum. When you enter the seed words you click options and choose BIP39. When prompted with a "derivation" value you change the 44 to 49, and wham, it will make a Segwit wallet with 3... style compatible addresses. 
Either way you'd have to send your BTC to the new wallet. And only when you spend from the Segwit wallet would you see lower fees. Native Segwit (bc1...) would have fees about half of  Transition Segwit (3..) fees, and these ones would be lower than Normal fees but probably not by half.

You could do this by supplying only the `blocks` directory. A new install can use the `blocks` directory and re-verify the data and build the chainstate from just raw blk*.dat files. 
The thing is you may not save much except download bandwidth as the verify time may be almost as long as normal sync time depending on connection speed. But this method can help if you have slow internet. Especially if you have access to a fast machine for verifying and then move the verified data to the slower one.
Anyway, without your node verifying the data you are trusting that whoever gives you blockchain data hasn't altered past txs.

With a large tx size it will be hard to ever get it very low. You can wait until the network is not busy but that could be a long time. A week or two back was perfect. Even 5-10 sat/byte txs were clearing quickly.
Another thing you can do is look at the coins tab and check all the outputs listed. You can select (ctrl-click) some of the biggest and right-click to use only those in a tx. By not including many small ones you reduce the size of the tx. So you won't be able to send 100% all BTC but you may find that 90% of BTC balance can be sent for much, much less. It depends how many small, medium, or large output amounts you actually have. Manually selecting allows ignoring tiny ones that may cost almost as much to send as they are worth. Electrum does not use outputs that cost more to send than they are worth but it doesn't drop ones which are marginally borderline and those may be better left for some day when fees are cheap. So play with that and maybe you can send a good portion for very little and leave the stuff that's inflating your tx size for later.

Sounds like it's not a BIP39 seed then. If you can export or get the private key for the address from the wallet then you can create an "import" wallet in Electrum that gives you control over the btc on that address, and then send it for low fee. Other than that I don't know what will work.

There has been a few stories this last week about how high fees tied up someones tx moving coins to sell and by the time the tx got confirmed it had recovered and they now wanted to hold. Saved by the fees. But don't blame me. I've already shown perfectly how well I can see the future. :)

There was a tool someone wrote for scanning raw disk partitions for wallet data. I think it's on github but don't recall the name now. You might try a search on bitcointalk.org for posts related to hard disk wallet recovery.

You can replace the fee while it's still unconfirmed. I guess that's obvious - no need to replace once it's in a block. There are some rules about fee going up and not down.
Also, there is a way to bump your tx still from Electrum under some conditions. It's called CPFP (Child Pays For Parent). You need one tx output going to your wallet. eg. either the amount you sent or the change back from the amount. 
Check the unconfirmed tx details in the history list. See if one output address is in your wallet - usually coloured in green. If it is then make mental note of it. Go to address list (Ctrl-A) and look for that address. It may be in change/used section. Right click and choose Send From. 
It gets added to Send screen as input. Now choose a send to address from addresses in your wallet. You will send from that unconfirmed output to your own address and pay a higher fee. Choose a fee that covers the (original unconfirmed tx size plus this new size) x 80/sat/bytes or more. If that is worth it to you then send. 
Miners supporting  CPFP will apply the higher fee to include both the unconfirmed and new tx in a block based on the new fee and total tx pair size. With a good fee should be only a few blocks to confirm.

This sounds like a case where Schnorr sigs will help. I'm not certain of specific details but I think when you have many input signatures it can reduce them to one. I know this is down the road a bit but it's another item that depends on SegWit to work.

I'm sorry, but running a node on AWS is just dumb. It defeats the purpose of independently validating your node when a third party has control over it. I did it 8 years ago when I first got into Bitcoin and soon realized this and closed it down in favour of running a home node. I've had no issues with a  node over the years but if I did I would just tunnel the listening port to one of my hosted servers rather than moving the whole node. Many advantages to this method. 
Or use a satellite dish if truly worried about your IP.

It doesn't need any confirmations. Most wallets show the tx and balance even when unconfirmed. Is that address posted yours, in your wallet? If so then the btc in that last tx are being spent from the wallet and it has a zero balance. Anyway, all txs to do with that address are confirmed and should be showing up in any wallet you're using. So what wallet are you using that is not showing the received btc?

There could be an ongoing canonical hash of the blockchain. That is, every block in order hashed to one master hash. I don't know if that can work but I'm sure the Core devs have thought of it and any downsides. But anyway, it doesn't help a pruned node except in the case where it has a new wallet and doesn't need any history to verify txs, which may be pretty common for new users anyway. And in that case you can get away with some agreed upon hash of the UTXOs only, or chain state folder, a much smaller but changing data set (~ 2GB now).

In summary, for those not wanting to click thru: You run a program that manages a special wallet which posts offers to mix coins for a small fee. Many "makers" running such a script form a market of ready to mix coins for anyone looking to mix their coins. Since the script verifies the details of any trx before signing, your btc remain safe and only ever move between addresses in your wallet. Once started it's entirely automated and you simply view the log to see what "joins" you took part of and fees you received. The fees are very small because it's competitive.

Yes. But when you pay someone are they responsible for creating a new wallet and finding missing funds? Or are they legally correct in saying the BTC never arrived because they aren't on the blockchain and not in his wallet? 
It's like sending a bank draft to the wrong bank. Is the recipient required to go open a new account at the wrong branch in order to get paid or do they simply say "Never Paid, wont ship". 
And guess what the BTC are lost to the sender because it's NOT his private keys to reclaim the funds. Is he going to take the vendor to court to demand they create a new wallet and refund the missing and wrong currency funds?

A passphrase is not included in the checksum. It is totally outside that and can use any alphanumeric data. That's why I didn't know what you meant by that.
As for my other words they are valid BIP39 checksum but I wasn't bothering to try and do proper haiku as I have no idea what that even means. I think you missed the joke in my word selection though.
edit - Oh, wait I see you are treating the whole seed word list as "the passphrase". That is a non-standard use of the term. It usually means an extra value in addition to the seed word list. At least that's how BIP39 is defined and used by all wallets I've seen.

3... is P2SH address which may be several things but the main two are either multisig or segwit (wrapped). P2SH (pay 2 script hash) means the address is a hash of a redeem script rather than a public key. Sometimes that script is the code for handling multiple key signatures but in the case of segwit the script is pushing a public key hash. It provides a way to use segwit but remain compatible with older clients. The downside is that it doesn't save as much in fees.

If websites like that can't get it right then no wonder coinbase can't either. At this moment there is a 50% chance of being in the next block for between 10-20 sat/byte.
Click on the legend fee value 10-20 - see that the last few blocks have been including ~half of all txs in that range. In 20-30 it's more like 90% of txs included. 
But it's great that these exchanges keep their fees higher as that lets people who manually set fees get in fast and cheap. As of this block a moment ago even &lt; 10 sat/byte txs are starting to be included.

Yes, but that's some serious hardware you get use of. I just took a look and even the g3.x4large - that's an Nvidea Tesla M60, cost ~$6000. The old g2.2xlarge was a GRID K520 at ~$1000. A benchmark I found shows ~1.8x gain, M60 vs. K520, so cost wise it's not efficient, but it's fairly close to spot price/hour increase. On the other hand that same bench showed mining btc (sha256) at 5x faster on the M60 (not that anyone sane would do that). Just interesting. And then the M60 uses about 300W so you'd have to account for that cost in the hourly rate. If you pay 0.12/kwh (not unusual) then subtract 0.04 from 0.29 spot price because even if you could amortize a $6000 GPU over some given hours you'd pay for electricity anyway.
Regarding the EC2 quote - I bet they are pricing at On Demand rather than Spot Prices, and also the p2.16xlarge is older generation. If you use spot prices it's $3.20/hour. The p3.8xlarge is close at $2.58/hour and being several years newer I wonder if it's more than 1.8x faster. Worth a trial probably as if you create an AMI you can probably spin one up on both choices to compare. My guess is the p3.8xlarge is the better deal.
edit - I'm not sure the diff p3 vs g3. Either way, should test variants for short periods to see which is most efficient. Even for buying hardware yourself you can use EC2 as test bench for what is best to buy.
edit - oh, I see. V100 vs. K80 vs. M60 GPUs...

You can usually judge visually where things are at. The zig zag notches are blocks being mined. The color bars flat and straight means they aren't getting confirmed so pay more than that. The ones getting good notches / drops are getting included in blocks. You can click on the legend values and it removes the lower fees which acts like a zoom on the fees above. eg. right now click on 10-20, and you can see right away that 20-30 are getting partly included each block but above that is almost a sure thing.
There are a couple sites that try to estimate the best fee but I've found they pretty much always suggest too high a fee.

He doesn't need a script - they can all be generated from one seed. So he just uses a wallet to watch all his customers funds and when it gets nice and juice he does a single sweep tx to another wallet. In Electrum it's as simple as hitting the "Max" button and all outputs will be added to the tx. Or he could snipe them and only hit the ones with worthwhile amounts.
I once coded a plugin for Electrum that would print paper wallets from the keys in the wallet so you could hand them out as trials but sweep back any one not used by the recipient.

I know very well about the spec as I've programmed it several times. The checksum only covers the seed words and not the passphrase. But read my last edit above as you seem to be using "passphrase" in a non-standard way. A seed word list is not a passphrase even as defined by the spec.

If you don't want to spend daily from your Electrum wallet then you can convert it to a watch-only wallet, removing the seed completely. That makes it impossible to spend from. Then it doesn't matter about your password and is easier to just monitor your wallet and receive btc.
To do this select menu Wallet, Information and copy the xpub value to the clipboard. Then File, New/Restore. Enter a new filename, choose Standard, Use Master Key. Paste the xpub value. Continue. This creates a wallet that can do everything but sign txs. You can still create a tx and sign on another offline system if you ever need. 
If this new wallet matches addresses and shows your correct balance then you should use a shred/secure delete tool to delete the original wallet file.
If you have a watch-only wallet then a Trezor gives you no additional security. If you stay as is then you are still prone to malware that may intercept your clipboard, alter Electrum and/or get your password. If it also has your wallet file then it can swipe your btc. The strength of your pwd doesn't matter if you enter it on an compromised system. 
The main issue with your current wallet is you need to enter the pwd just to open it (unless you chose not full-file encryption at setup). Entering that pwd is a risk if the system becomes compromised. Another option is to choose not to use full-file encryption. Then you only enter the pwd to spend and not on every wallet viewing.
btw I commend you on getting this sorted out while you still have only a small amount of btc. It's not rare to see users trying to figure this out after they sent thousands of $$ to a wallet they haphazardly whipped up and maybe didn't even write down the seed. ������

Yes. It's definitely titanium. This is the [one I bought]( I got 1mm but wished after I had got 0.5mm as it was a bit thick to be a credit card. There are a few tests you can do and IIRC the easiest one is noticing the bright white fiery sparks when cutting. I cut mine down to make two cards and rounded the corners. I've cut a lot of aluminum too and it's much different, plus feels different when hit and flexed. Totally non-magnetic too (but so is AL).
Here's the [spring punch]( (since I'm adding links, not same seller but heaps available). I thought this tool was going to be a flimsy joke but actually after using it for several metal projects I'm pretty impressed with how well it works. So much better than using a hammer.
Use the punch with metal on hard surface like tile bench. If on soft wood then it hits strong enough to make bumps that show on opposite side.

Except, of course, if this were plausible then China would be monitoring it and be very likely to outstrip the US in buying up Bitcoin with it's soon to be worthless dollars.

The best option in Electrum is to set a low fee manually but enable "replaceable" so you can adjust it later if it turns out too low or the rates go up.
Also, totally ignore any block count estimate. It'll say 25 blocks but it means "Unknown". You cannot predict anything beyond a few blocks.

He comments on building his own software but with Trezor you can compile and install yourself. Heck, you can build the hardware yourself too and only trust that ST Micro hasn't made malicious silicon (or some intermediary replaced the chip). 
I priced out the parts once and it ran $25-30 US @ 10 qty. No wonder no one bothers as the savings aren't worth the time to even think about building one unless you just like playing with chips and toaster ovens (like me).
I thought I read they had deterministic builds (not sure now) and if so then you would be able to build the firmware to verify the mfr. firmware signature matches. That's a decent security step for those so inclined.

Cannot be done in Electrum as far as I know. They chose Segwit 3... type to be compatible with hardware wallets which are using that. And native Segwit (bech32) for native Electrum because it reduces size by 50% over 3... addresses txs and so reduces fee the most.
Native Electrum encodes a wallet type and version info into the seed words so you cannot use the same BIP39 seed for native wallets. You would have to create a native Electrum seed and send your BTC to that wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:33:03
Do you know what rate it's using ( sat/byte )? Some wallets are especially bad at estimating fees. I guess you're using LedgerWallet? You can choose Custom Fees and then enter a sat/byte rate. Right now ~ 260 sat/byte will confirm fairly soon. If you don't mind waiting a few hours you could try lower. It's still high but working it's way down.
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:57:21
I think I read somewhere Jaxx is BIP39. If so, then you got a seed word list when you created your wallet which you wrote down. You can install Electrum on any desktop and restore from your seed words to see your wallet, it's transactions and balance. Electrum is a reliable wallet with many features including offline signing for better security. And it's used by a large community of advanced users who can help with issues.
If Jaxx is acting buggy then you should believe what you see on a block explorer more than Jaxx. 
If you do restore on Electrum then on the screen where you type your words in you must click options and choose BIP39.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:02:39
I would recommend using Electrum and if the amounts are significant learn how to do either offline signing or make a multisig wallet with an offline signor. Offline signing is a bit more hassle (1-5 minutes to sign a tx depending how you do it) but worth it as a barrier to malware.

Maybe flaky hardware (disk, mem). It shouldn't need to reindex unless it's detected something corrupted. I have the full chain on a Celeron, 4GB RAM, large ZFS array and had power outages several times and never even a hiccup. We had a power out two days ago and so it's fresh in my mind that it just started up and kept on going. You need about 230GB of space so make sure you have that. It shouldn't take more than a few days even on fairly low end hardware and mediocre internet. I think on mine it took 4-5 days with a crap 7Mbps connection and sluggish Celeron. Only on a raspi with USB hard disk is it likely to take weeks.

I read where ThomasV said that native segwit was implemented because p2sh segwit was a waste of space and the impression I got is "no way we're doing supporting p2sh segwit". So I wouldn't expect any changes to support compatible addresses. Current best use for Segwit on Electrum is the BIP39-49 hack (that hardware wallets use) and that may it for a long time til bech32 is widespread.

A trx is broadcast by a node on the network to it's peers. But usually you cannot get access to a node unless you run one yourself. Most users do not directly expose the interface publicly.
Some companies like blockchain.info and bitpay have either a web form or api you can use to pass the trx data to their node, which will send it out to it's peers. These nodes are also typically well connected. Peers receiving your trx will store it in their "mempool" (trxs waiting for confirmation), and also relay it onwards to more peers. This way it gets out to all nodes. Some nodes are miners and they will (or can, depending on their own choice) include it in a block. eg. 
To build a trx you need some software that is capable of collecting up unspent outputs you have keys for and creating a specific data structure, and signing that with the required keys. That results in a small block of data often expressed in "hex" format (transmitted across the network as binary data). This trx data is typically a few hundred bytes but could be longer if it's complex (has many inputs / outputs).
Programs like bitcoin-qt and Electrum can create a hex format transaction. I think there are a couple online tools as well. Maybe  - I haven't used but seems to allow broadcast as well.
edit: and of course, I'm leaving out that the main task of "wallet" software is to manage your keys and create/broadcast trxs, which it does in various ways, either through it being a node (bitcoin-qt) or servers operating a node (web wallets, android wallets, electrum etc).

If one of those output addresses is yours, in your wallet, then yes you can spend that unconfirmed output to another address in your wallet and put a higher fee on it.  And it should confirm more quickly or may even confirm when it might not as is.
But two issues: 
1. Is it the $0.74 one? Really? Why bother as the fee will no doubt be as much or more. But hurry as fees are going back up and even 30 sat/byte may not be quick.
2. You need a wallet that can spend unconfirmed outputs like Electrum (which can also simplify the CPFP with a right click on the tx line).
To do CPFP you need to include a fee to cover both the original and new tx size total at a suitable rate. eg. that one is 373 bytes plus your new one at maybe 225 bytes, total 598 bytes @ 30 sat/byte = 0.1794 mbtc or ~$1.31 and that may not be high enough now.
BTW An unconfirmed tx is not on the blockchain yet. It is in the mempool (many nodes and miner's mempools) until confirmed and can vanish if left unconfirmed long enough. When I say vanish I mean the tx is dropped and the btc remain where they are now.

Definitely **Multisig** using an offline wallet (Electrum) and a hardware wallet, and maybe just a paper wallet too (seed written down). You can work out what combination works best for you. I've used 2 of 3 multisig with one being my Ledger Nano, another being a usb stick (or uSD card) offline Electrum, and a third being a backup seed written only on paper. This would require 2 of the 3 to sign which normally would be my Nano and my offline usb stick. Bit if either of those fails, is lost, burned up or stolen then I can go get the paper and complete a tx. You could use 2 of 4 and have two paper seeds in different locations so that even if both "devices" failed you could fall back on paper. You'll want paper backups of the devices anyway so I see this as overkill. Or whatever fits your circumstances.
Oh, and test out a few txs when you create a wallet to make sure you know the process and that everything is as expected.
Some people like to spread their balance across several addresses too on the chance that one being randomly cracked doesn't wipe out everything. It's a long long shot but I guess no harm in spreading the risk, however tiny.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:56:26
NO It fucking isn't. It's on a different blockchain and cannot be spent across chains without going to an exchange and trading it. Hence it is NOT still Bitcoin.

Practically speaking, you can't. Yes, in theory you can multiply the random binary value by the generator point using elliptic curve math and then take that public key and convert it to an address but in reality this is such a long process to do by hand (and incredibly error prone) that you would never succeed. You'd probably want to do it twice to ensure you get the same result as a test against making a trivial error in one of hundreds of steps.
In practice your best bet is to make a linux boot usb stick and boot up on that as an offline system and run some simple utility to do it for you. [Here is my ultra simple elliptic curve python tool]( that shows you in simple steps what math is required (4 basic EC functions, no EC library, just hashlib). It's all simple enough but incredibly repetitive and by hand you would very likely make errors.

Transactions are instant because they don't settle on the blockchain until the channel is closed. The channel is to a network so you can interact with anyone else on the network with your channel. You may end up keeping it open and adding/removing funds indefinitely; that would mean only rarely having to settle on the blockchain and wait for that process. It leverages the blockchain as guarantor of the funds in the channel without clogging the blockchain with all it's transactions. There are a few good youtube videos that explain with graphics and are worth watching to understand the many advantages.
@_date: 2019-12-14 10:41:33
You can use Electrum from command line with bash script to poll and create a new tx. Or import electrum into your own python script and code it that way. This is a bit more elegant probably than bash but certainly bash is feasible too. Electrum has a command line interface and since it's written in python the library code can be imported and used directly by user python scripts.
Probably most elegant would be reading up the docs (or just digging more like) on Electrum plugins and writing a plugin that does this. It can set a hook on new tx notification and then create a tx when that occurs.
If you're open to running a pruning node then another way using a small python script is hooking on the zmq rawtx messages and having that trigger an rpc call to create a new tx. That's also fairly easy to write, though granted if you don't code you'd be looking at having someone do it. I have code around that can be mashed into that, I guess, in a couple hours probably.

Apparently hashcat may be faster, though I haven't tried. You may find [this article]( interesting - about using Nvidia GPU instances on Amazon EC2 to run hashcat.

He says that's on a 1xGPU instance and they offer 4xGPU instances that should scale linearly. I had a peek at prices and his g2.2xlarge instance cost $0.65/hour. Cheap for a test run but that would cost a lot to run for long. BUT as a spot instance (which is great for this stuff as long as you create an AMI for your task) it's only $0.15/hour. And I wonder how the newer g3.4xlarge performs and what GPU it has - it's $0.29/hour.

The different colour bands are just different fee levels. I simply look towards the right side at the most recent (most right) band that is impacted by notch (new block). For example, right now the yellow 120 sat/byte band has a big notch indicating a lot of txs at that fee level were mined. So that is a good fee to use.
You can also the mempool size method instead or as second opinion. Hover over the far right edge so the popup fee-tx counts table appears. Scan up til you find the fee that's less than approx. 2000-3000 txs. A typical block mines about 2000-3000 txs. So the fee next to that count is likely to confirm fairly soon. 
Neither of these methods can predict the future. Right now, it's terrible. 120 sat/byte. Look at that super long slope in middle - no block for almost an hour. That messed up the confirmations and pushed the rate up.
edit - oops. Found a new block and now fee dropped to around 4 sat/byte - the blue band which has a deep notch now.

This works but dealing with the result may need adjusting the query, eg. counting result rows, ordering or summing them etc.

That indicates yet another directory level further. The 'd' as part of 'drwxr' for each entry means "directory". Meaning that "Contents" is yet another directory.

You can use with OTG cable or adapter. I have a tiny one that inserts inside a normal usb A end so it goes in micro usb but there are heaps of variants on ebay that cost only a few dollars. The phone has to support OTG and most new ones do but some low-end or older models may not.
After that it's just software. The trezor.io wallet supports it when opened in browser (I tested) and also Mycelium (untested by me). I'm pretty sure Electrum mobile does not though would be great if it could.
edit - OTG is "on-the-go". It's a cable with extra sense pin grounded which allows phone to act as host instead of being a device to another host.

Hmm.  I'd only be guessing. Let's say I assigned relative time units which I have not in any way tested but very roughly based on these hash/ecdsa [benchmarks]( (very cpu dependent).
1. Single private keys:
Privkey incremented (1). EC Multiply (2000000) to pubkey. sha256x2 (500). Ripemd (1000) to pkh. Lookup (1000). Total 2002501 units.
2. BIP39 - Specific seed words or passphrase: Word alteration (1). PBKDF2/SHA512x2048 (500*2048). SHA512 mpk (500). EC Multiply (2000000) to pubkey. sha256x2 (500). Ripemd (1000) to pkh. Lookup (1000). Total 3027001 units.
3. BIP32 - Binary seed (skip words direct to BIP32): SHA512 mpk (500). EC Multiply (2000000) to pubkey. sha256x2 (500). Ripemd (1000) to pkh. Lookup (1000). Total 2003001 units.
So ratio, single key vs. seed passphrase ~ 150%. 
But if you skip words and go from binary seed to mpk then it's near equal. You get a 33% speed boost by bypassing words and just brute forcing binary seeds on BIP32 scheme. Note if you know a seed / partial seed word list you have much fewer tests compared to simple binary seeds.
I'm a bit surprised the EC multiply is so very slow but maybe I'm wrong, or missed something. This is by no means rigorous. It's not based on secp256k1 (not available in benchmarks) but another close EC curve 233k. I used 1000 for utxo lookups but I don't know if that's reasonable.

I'm a Mycelium/Electrum user and gave Android Copay a look. I haven't used it except to see how it looks. I didn't like their backup method via email. It's encrypted but I think a lot of users won't use a long password and that's important for anything sent by email. I gpg encrypted the backup by passing it thru OpenKeyChain first and then via email. I would have preferred to just save it to file and copy that over bypassing public channels. Actually I really prefer a word list like Mycelium and Electrum but I suppose that's hard when they store more than just the seed. A word list is easy for paper backup, whereas their method it seems you would need to manually make a QR code of the backup and print that. I'm not very trusting of electronic-only backups as I've lost so much stuff over the years.
As for operationally I need to do some actual trxs but the interface is certainly a clean minimalist approach and looks good.
As for your error it may be due to having or not having the **bitcoin:** prefix. I've seen general disagreement in how different places do this and it's best for any qr reader to allow for either case.

You can connect and use your current wallet with Electrum. And you can create a bech32 wallet as well. It's actually useful to have both for any cases where someone cannot send to your bech32 wallet, though that should be less and less of an issue over time.
I think Electrum supports creating a bech32 wallet without any experimental settings. I'm not totally sure because I actually use a Trezor but I think they are pretty similar in what support Electrum provides. I know on Trezor only one seed is stored but you can have different types of wallets off that one seed or also use passphrases to create many wallets even of same type.
It would make sense to wait for a low fee time before sending any btc to a new bech32 wallet. IMO the main advantage you get from Electrum is wallet features and better privacy when using EPS. I'm not sure the fee savings with bech32 are significant though perhaps if you do many txs or if things change in future.

You always take a risk using any wallet on an internet connected computer. But risk comes in degrees - for small amounts storing your keys on your desktop is no big deal. For large amounts you should use either an offline system (not connected to internet ever again after created) or a hardware wallet. Bitcoin core is not any worse or better than other wallets with regards to malware that steals btc. 
A more safe approach (whether core or other wallet like electrum) is to keep private keys offline and only import the address to your wallet on your desktop. That's a "watch-only" wallet that allows monitoring your btc but for spending you need to create a tx and sign it offline.

She says "for payments", and that's something you do not need to use a central company for at all. You just use Bitcoin or if you're trying to automate it as a merchant you can use one of many choices for integrating Bitcoin into your merchant processing. I mean actual Bitcoin vs. an online wallet that converts to USD and keeps your btc for you. Though Bitpay does have some sweep ability that moves pmts into your own wallet it's entirely possible to bypass them and use your own wallet directly. 
(edit: Coinkite has some pretty good stuff.)
But if you are interested in exchanges to get in/out of fiat money then the current best bet I know is still localbitcoins. It is centralized but it's currently the closest to being able to deal directly with users to trade (that is actually working). Well, OTC has been around for ages but is quite hard for most people to figure out.

The two numbers are completely unrelated. 21 million is how many bitcoins will exist when all have been mined (over 100 years away) but any number of bitcoins can be sent to an address, as little as 0.00000001 btc (called 1 satoshi). If you're interested in some current address amounts check out this site which lists the [Top Addresses]( See the "search" tab for how many addresses contains given amounts. 
Even if you could spread 1 satoshi each on unique addresses 100 years from now only about 1 in 6.9 ×10³² of available addresses would be used.
Also, we can distinguish between "can't be used" and "won't be used". Any address potentially can be used but most won't ever be used. You cannot know if an address is used unless you guess a private key and generate the address for it and then check it on the blockchain. This process takes time and energy and I've seen estimates that the amount of energy to check every key/address pair is beyond that available in the universe or some such absurd amount.

Not wrong or right really. Gold isn't used for payments much any more but people still buy it as a safe haven. There's nothing wring with Bitcoin taking on that role. It may eventually prove to be the most important. No one really knows. But one thing that makes it better than Gold is that it can also be easily used for payment when needed, instantly world wide. I think there is still years ahead of discovery where we will find out what function Bitcoin fills, and what things it can enable that we don't even know yet. Like looking at early '80s PCs and trying to predict what a 2010s smart phone or notebook will be like.

How could a miner collect more than he "invested"? Best case is he mines a block and gets back his own fees but more typically he will mine &lt;50% blocks and get back only &lt;50% of fees he "invested". Or is some other sucker paying the fees for the miner? Fees would have to increase by more than 1/ (percent blocks mined) to even break even with not doing this. So only maybe the biggest miner has any hope of that.
(Currently F2Pool or Ant @ 17%, 1/.17 = ~6x fee increase to gain at all)

Partly true. You still need some secure device to use Electrum. A raspberry pi, or an offline system. A Trezor makes a pretty convenient device, even if more costly than a raspi it's simpler and more convenient.

You are better off buying btc. For miners to remain profitable the price must move up but if the price moves up you will make more by holding btc. The only reason to mine is if you need "virgin" coins or have no way to buy them without KYC.
Before the previous halvings users always worried about the same thing, and both times the price adjusted to keep profitability. If not profitable, miners drop out leaving it profitable for the more efficient ones. Buying a few thousand worth of mining gear will give you such a slow trickle of income that it will take years to come out ahead and even then only if btc price rises. So skip this and just buy btc. It's the same bet but so much easier.

Humans aren't very good at picking random words. It's generally going to have much less entropy than using a RNG the way Electrum does it. Anyway, you can pick your own words and enter them except for the last checksum word which needs to be calculated (or tried manually until it works). 
Electrum creates a seed word phrase from a  totally random number. There is some very small chance it will generate the one you select but that's the way all keys and seeds work. Your main issue is that your human selected list is likely to have less randomness than one picked by the computer. So much so that cracking software may find it much more quickly than a truly random one. It is very much recommended against. 
If you want to do this then use the [diceware BIP39]( method with dice. That way ensures you get max entropy (true randomness of the full 2048 word space).
To understand what I mean by weak human randomness imagine sitting down and selecting words until you can't think of any more random words. For them to work they have to be from the standard BIP39 2048 word list. If you write down only a few hundred before repeating words then you are essentially using that much smaller word space. Any software that scans this smaller space can more quickly brute force such seeds.

I wrote a [BIP38 python tool]( for encrypting/decrypting as well. You may want to compare some of the code to see where it may be wrong. As far as I've tested mine I think it does work. Is it possible it has a flaw related to proper handling of compressed/uncompressed keys? I know I updated mine back in 2015 to handle compressed and early efforts often didn't. I'll dig into what you linked a little and see if I can see what may be wrong.
I also wrote a [simple BIP38 cracker]( tool. It's slow but very simple and easy to see what how it works. Same decryption code. Maybe it will help somehow, probably not.
Do you have a rough date for when you encrypted with Bippy? I ask because maybe they fixed an old bug. It would be good to go back and checkout a version from that date and diff against later fixed ones. 
edit - I tested my python tool with your example key above. Mine produced a different BIP38 key: `6PRUE3irsMm7ibQENKPjkpuB8JVovcBErGzQTtVN4bCgSJzjdVFsnGzEPB`
When I feed it back in with same pwd it does give me back the correct key.

With so many trxs waiting to be confirmed it makes it hard for new trxs to be confirmed quicky unless they pay a higher fee. The miners use an algorithm based on fee and priority criteria to decide which trxs to include. It's not simply first come first served. So new trxs with a low fee will sit for a very long time.
But I did notice that both BitFury and DiscusFish mined a block with very low new trxs. Maybe they were trying to clear up a backlog of very old trxs.
Anyway, the impact is that it slows down confirmation times for many users.
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:05:42
The problem is that you probably click on "pay out" from the mining pool fairly often and so got a lot of small pmts in your wallet. Back in the old days when the blocks were mostly empty it didn't matter because big tx size was still very cheap. But now every byte is precious and costs so much more, and then BTC is so much higher in price that every satoshi is actually worth something.
You have many small outputs in your wallet and in order to send them all of those small outputs need to be included with signatures to prove you "own them". That makes your spend tx much larger in byte size. You should try to find a balance by spending only the largest value outputs in a tx and leave the mish-mash barely worth it ones for some day when they will be cheap. If you leave them until signature aggregation (Schnorr) is merged in Bitcoin core then many input txs will cost about the same as single input txs because signatures can be merged. That is still some ways off though - come back in a year or two or whatever the roadmap is for that.

You need to create a new wallet and choose "SegWit" option. But don't rush ahead yet as the native segwit mode Electrum has chosen won't be usable by other wallets/vendors for some time yet. Right now the only immediate way to use SegWit with Electrum is to create a BIP39 seed elsewhere and restore it to Electrum and changing the derivation code from 44 to 49. Then you have 3... type addresses that can be sent to by other non-native-segwit wallets/vendors. 
It's great the Electrum devs are thinking long term but right now they are ahead of the pack and cannot interoperate with anyone. So Electrum is not going to have much impact on SegWit uptake for now.
Today the only popular wallet that can send to bech32 addresses (native segwit) is Electrum. So you could use your current wallet as an intermediary to send to a native SegWit cold storage.

The device in this case is the SD card (with OS and Electrum and wallet file) not the raspberry pi which contains nothing and is not unique. You can plug the SD card into any raspi. As long as you have a paper seed backup I don't know any reason not to use one wallet. You could use multiple addresses if you like but I don't really think it makes any difference (statistically). It's important to keep copies in multiple locations to avoid risk of fire. The SD card is pretty safe from theft if it has a strong password. 
There's nothing wrong with spreading across several wallets as long as you remember what you've done when you come back many years later. I'm terrible with stuff I did years ago so I'd tend to keep it as simple but strong as possible.
One thing I've considered is creating a BIP38 paper wallet. Keep that in a few places. It has a password and is hard to crack even if the paper is found/stolen. And then use the decrypted key as your seed value for Electrum. So you have both convenience and strong paper backup. If the SD cards fail or get lost/stolen then you must remember the password for the papers. BIP38 just makes it easy to deal with and doesn't require long difficult passwords.
I'd like to see Electrum support reading a BIP38 QR code when restoring from seed. Alas, it does not and you'd have to deal with it manually using a BIP38 converter util (which I wrote...).

They cover entirely different aspects of key and wallet use. 
BIP38 is a standard for single private key encryption using AES and scrypt hardening. In the past some tools have had erroneous implementations so that's something to be careful about, and it's not a very popular method nowadays since it was never extended to encrypt seeds (that most wallets now use). It is used by many paper wallets generators (now also out of favor).
BIP39 is a standard way of encoding entropy (random bit data) into a word list usually used to encode a seed. The random value encoded is used as the base for generating any number of private keys in a repeatable sequence - covered by companion standard BIP32 - for hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets. Most wallets use these two BIPs  but not all do. eg. Electrum is very popular and can restore a BIP39 seed but creates it's own seed word encoding using a proprietary method (but still uses the same BIP39 word list).

Best you can do now is figure out how it got compromised and not repeat. For starters, that wallet is crap. It has a long history of failures and hacks. Your case may be different but that wallet doesn't give you a good start point for security. The only real secure way to store btc is offline wallets - look into hardware wallets (easy), or air-gapped Electrum (usb boot stick)(more work).

Almost all mining is done by a [dozen pools]( But each pool has an unknown number of actual members. Each pool knows it's members and some info may be  shared. If someone collected public stats they could probably come up with an estimate based on that. I haven't seen any fact based estimates myself. 
Back when I mined I recall there being perhaps a hundred members in my pool that had the majority of shares. So based on that, if it holds still, you may be counting 1200 miners that do most of the mining and have substantial equipment investments.

A private key is 256 bits long. In non-tech-math speak that's "1...+77 zeros". Even with 7 billion users each person could have more than "1...+67 zeros" each. The likelihood of randomly guessing each others key is so low that it's completely infeasible. But you are right that if you do guess or "find" a key that's not your own then you can take those bitcoins. Which is why the critical thing in Bitcoin is to secure your private keys.
A transaction is a small data record that is "signed" using your private key. Every bitcoin node verifies that signature using the public key and only accepts the transaction if valid. Since a transaction can only take inputs that have not previously been used, as verified in the blockchain (ledger), it is not possible to "double spend".
Of course, the details of this are more complicated, using cryptography, and you should read up or watch some of the Bitcoin 101 videos on Youtube.

Besides not being able to import an xpub I think it uses a different scheme than Electrum. Your simplest bet if you want to use an Electrum xpub is change your gap limit and pre-generate a bunch of addresses and import those into bitcoin core. It will behave as watch-only. If you don't mind installing and using [electrum-personal-server]( that's another way that is more automated but essentially does the same thing under the hood.
If you want to try that, in the console:
    wallet.storage.put('gap_limit', 100)
    ... close and reopen wallet ...

If you don't want to wait then you can use Electrum to create an "import" wallet, import the private key for at least one of the inputs used, and then send a new trx with fee to one of your own addresses (or to your original dest). When the new trx confirms the old one will be discarded as invalid.
Securely delete the wallet after completed as leaving the key laying around is unsafe.

The block reward is a simple calculation that is made for every block when created and verified. It is the constant 50 (initial value) binary right shifted by the block number divided by 210000. The right shift is the equivalent of dividing by two for each bit position. 
block 256:  50 &gt;&gt; (256/210000) = 50 because 256/210000 is zero (as an integer) and 0 right shift is no change.
block 340000:  50 &gt;&gt; (340000/210000) = 25 because (340000/210000) is 1 (as an integer) and 1 right shift is same as divide by 2
The arithmetic result is reward halving every 210000 blocks automatically. No other fancy rules, forks or algorithms are needed. It's super elegant and simple. It is determined by two initial values (50 and 210000) and the block number. This series sum also determines the total maximum btc that will ever be created. (50+50+50... +25+25+25.... +12.5+12.5... ... 1 sat +1 sat + 1 sat + 0 + 0 + 0... forever)

You can create a transaction with a future locktime (say 1 year) that pays to a given set of addresses and then keep it safe (not broadcast it). In the event you die then that transaction can be broadcast by someone alive, or perhaps a timeclock web service that posts an http request (I think I've seen that before). It cannot be accepted by the network before it's locktime. If you don't die then you can roll it over with an updated one with a later locktime and delete the expired one.
A signed transaction with past locktime can be broadcast with very little technical knowledge. Basically you paste the text in a [web page]( and click Send. It can be automated if you have some way to know you died. It cannot be altered at all unless someone gains access to your private keys and can make a new different one.
However, this method requires knowing all wallet coins in advance. You can't have it spend coins you get later. You'd have to update the transaction every time you got more or spent any btc.

I've done this on my home server. My main storage is a 4 drive ZFS pool but it uses HGST drives that are pretty noisy. I could hear each block arrive due to the burst of drive activity (all 4 drives at once). So I moved the chainstate to the boot ssd and now it's quiet. This is on Mint 19 (Ubuntu), works great.
OP also asked about changing to a pruned node. You can simply add a prune= config option and it will automatically delete block files to get to a pruned state. But you can't go back without re-downloading again. So what I do is run a pruned node on my laptop that has a connect= config option pointed to my own server. That way it only connects to my node and creates a secondary pruned node. I like this because my laptop has limited space but I wanted it to be able to stay sync'd when I take it away. Or, you can make a backup of blocks directory and then add a prune= config. That way you can easily revert to full chain if desired later.

You sent BTC to an exchange. Regardless of whether BTC or BCC it's the exchanges address and private key so they control and hold/move the BTC without any need for permission from you or your key. If they are honest and can find and reclaim the BTC you sent, which no doubt takes someone time to track down and fix manually, then they will probably eventually credit it to your account. But don't mistakenly think that an address on an exchange is yours or under your control.

This is a popular method for using Electrum offline. It's good as long as you don't connect to the network again. Using the Entropy means you are trusting in that device to create truly random keys, which seems to be acceptable. I'd personally prefer Electrum and dice (you can create a seed that way and gen keys/addresses as needed). The advantage to Electrum is you can also have an online (desktop) watch-only wallet for generating new addresses, watching incoming trx, and creating unsigned trx that you can sign on the raspi. So it's both offline/cold and usable online.
If you try out Electrum there is a nice [install script on github]( to do it in one-step on raspbian. For this you do connect once to do the install but never connect again, before creating the wallet.
Whatever you do make backups of the sd card and preferably have paper too as they are not long term safe from corruption.

You don't need to be worried but your tx will not be confirmed. Your BTC will eventually end up back where they are now. That is, they were never moved but your wallet has to give up and show them as still present. Yes, fees have been too high but they are dropping and nothing much can be done for the time being except pay a higher fee or wait for the network to clear.
Check out this site,
Click on the legend value 60-80, see how some portion is getting "eaten" every few blocks? That fee rate is about as low as you can reasonably go and expect something to happen soon. Now click on 20-30 value in the legend. See the layers of other txs above? Those txs need to get confirmed before you can expect yours to be chomped up in a new block. 
Also, click on 2 days or 4 days and see where we've been while you were waiting for your 25 sat/byte tx to confirm.

That's cool. You may be interested in my [sqlchain]( project. It also parses the blk files and creates a MySQL database from the data. Well, it is optional as you can enable it or just use rpc calls to get data. I wrote it so the database could be sync'd while bitcoind itself was syncing. Normally while bitcoind is syncing it is very slow at responding to external rpc calls but with the blkdat parser enabled it can process blocks into SQL data much more quickly. Written in python as a daemon it keeps the database sync'd to bitcoind and can use pruned mode so that once in SQL the blk data is discarded to save space. It is possible to have full data (without signature/witness data) in approx. 50% the space of blk data using the [rocksdb]( engine (which uses compression and a log structured backend).

This would be a great idea. Or using Electrum servers would be much more redundant and empowering (even if as a fall back).

That's pretty close. When you get more technical bitcoins are actually the *inputs and outputs* of transactions. Hence, simply numeric values in the ledger much like in any bank. Whereas a bank allows it's employees to alter the ledger, in Bitcoin the program code enforces control. An address is a label as to which private key currently has control of an output value. In a transaction, moving (spending) bitcoins is using the correct private key to sign data consuming an output, and creating a new output under the control of a different key. 
Instead of torrent files the network relays blocks and transactions. Some "miner" nodes collect up the transactions and try to build blocks from them. But all nodes check each transaction and each block for validity before adding them into their own copy of the ledger. 
It's quite possible to have your own node which does this in some "corrupt" way (eg. lets fraudulent transactions be created/relayed) but when relayed onwards other nodes would discard these "bad" ones, maintaining network integrity. When a large portion of the network doesn't agree on the ledger contents we call this a "fork". Single block forks happen quite often and usually by the next block the network will discard one block (then called an orphan) continue using the other. This is why having "confirmations" is important - it makes sure your transaction is still agreed upon after several blocks and won't be discarded in the future.

In general mixing refers to processing trxs such that the originator of the btc cannot be determined. In the case of CoinJoin / JoinMarket this done by combining inputs from unrelated users into a trx providing various outputs where a specific output cannot be linked back to any specific input. In more typical trxs you would assume all inputs were from the same entity but in "joined" trxs that assumption becomes invalid.

What QR code did you scan? Was it one the ATM gave you or one you created and gave it?
If the ATM gave you one then I gather it was a *private key*. You would need to scan it on your wallet using a "sweep" function. Many wallets don't have that but Electrum does. If you didn't store or scan or have lost that QR code (or data) then you will have lost the btc.
If you printed or displayed a QR code for the ATM to scan then I'd assume you got it from your wallet and it's for an address you own. In that case the ATM should be sending it to your wallet and once confirmed it should show up in the wallet balance.

I'm a little confused by what you've written. When entering the command at terminal do not type "open option" before it. To run a program in the terminal you simply enter the program name and options. The exact error msg you get is important as it tells us what is wrong. eg.
`Electrum --server "localhost:50002:s" --oneserver`
The order of the options shouldn't matter here. But exact spelling and spaces do matter. Now, I work on Linux and here it's not `Electrum` but `electrum`. That may be different on Mac so I hesitate to correct it. If you type that and it doesn't work then copy/paste the error msg you get here so I can help.
To run from desktop you just start as usual by clicking a menu or icon on desktop and then make changes within the program using the "Preferences, Network" dialog box. There is no `oneserver` option from inside the program. But both of these options can also be set by editing the config file for the program and then just starting it normally. The config file is in the ~/.electrum/config file on linux and probably similarly in some Electrum data directory for you.
Anyway, I think to help out I need exact text for specific error messages you are seeing.

A checksum means that the last word depends on the choice of first 23 words. For a valid BIP39 seed you can have any choice of 23 words from the BIP39 word list (even same word multiple times) but the last word must be mathematical match based on the first 23. For any set of 23 words there are possible 8 correct valid last words. Someone posted a tool for finding the last word. That would allow creating a valid seed given your specific choice of words.

You would have to do this a specific way for it to work well.
1. Install Electrum (be sure from the [official site]( on your normal desktop. On first run you will create a wallet. Choose "From address or private keys" (bottom option I think). Copy paste in the address of your wallet - not the private key, which would be obviously unsafe on your desktop. The wallet will be watch-only and should sync to show any txs previously made and the current balance.
2. Using this wallet you will create a new spend. You now have to decide what to do with left over part. Do you want to send it back to same address or create a real offline wallet (a full HD wallet containing many addresses). The latter is better for future use and can still be kept entirely offline. Sending the change back to the same address will work also if you want to keep this simple as possible. 
    Assuming the first case (let me know if you want to create an offline HD wallet instead) you can simply create the tx on the send tab, pasting the address you want to send to, setting a suitable fee and clicking "Preview" to view the tx details are correct and show the change going back to your same address. If it looks right then click "Export" to save the unsigned tx to a usb stick.
3. Save the downloaded Electrum (AppImage binary according to your offline OS type) to your USB stick along with the unsigned tx file. Take this to the air-gapped system. Install or just run the Electrum program there. As before you will create a new wallet (don't save on USB stick though) but this time use the private key to create the wallet. This wallet will not show any tx history. Use the Tools, Load Transaction, From File menu item to select the unsigned tx file. It will show the same tx preview screen as before. Make sure destination and change addresses are correct and fee is same. This is the most critical step - ensure nothing is wrong with the tx. Click "Sign" and check the status changes to signed and no errors are shown. Once again click "Export" and save back to USB stick as "signed tx file". You can now exit and delete this wallet or leave for future use if you like. 
4. Take the USB stick back to desktop and in wallet once again choose "Tools, Load Transaction, from File". This time it should show the signed tx details. Again, make sure correct and click "Broadcast". That's it.

The true power of being a node is that you are choosing what network you are on. If some super powerful actor sets up a billion nodes they are either using new rules or the same rules - the latter is fine and welcome, but the former is a different network by definition and doesn't affect bitcoin unless you change your software to accept those rules, ie. join their network.

When you have a wallet on your desktop/phone it maintains an encrypted file with keys. This is generally fine but if you get malware infected with a key logger you are still susceptible to an attacker capturing your password and access to your wallet file. 
By maintaining a wallet on a system **not connected** to any network it becomes much, much more unlikely for an attacker to be able to get at your btc even if they gain control of your desktop system. So offline storage generally refers to keeping a wallet on paper, special hardware wallets (Trezor, Ledger), or non-connected systems. This is recommended for values large to enough make you fear their loss. 
One way of doing this is to install Electrum on a second system (or second boot usb stick) and then make sure that system is only booted while not connected to the network. I use a raspberry pi for this which is normally used as my XBMC media center. I just swap boot sd cards and pull the net cable, and boot up as a standalone wallet. But there are various other ways to do this.
Electrum supports this operation because it allows you to create a transaction using a "watch-only" wallet on your desktop. This is a wallet that has no seed / keys - so it cannot spend bitcoins. Here are the basic steps:
1. Install Electrum on a secondary system. Disconnect and never connect again on this system. Create a wallet and write down the seed. Export the MPK (Master Public Key) to a usb stick.
2. On your desktop system, plug in the usb stick and choose "File, Restore" wallet, pasting in the MPK. This create a "watch only" wallet. Now this wallet can view activity on the blockchain and create transactions but it cannot **sign** them.
Below is how you safely spend using offline signing:
1. On desktop create a transaction and save the "unsigned" transaction to a usb stick (only option on this type of wallet). 
2. On your secondary system plug in the usb stick and choose "Tools, Load Transaction". Verify the addresses and amounts are correct (not fiddled with by malware on the desktop before saving). Click "Sign" and enter password. Save the "signed" transaction back to the usb stick.
3. Back on desktop, plug in the usb stick and choose "Tools, Load Transaction". Check it's still correct. Click "Broadcast" to actually send it on the network.
In this model your seed/private keys are never exposed to a net connected computer. It's a bit more hassle, but not much. After you've done a couple test runs it becomes very easy. Obviously you wouldn't do this for pocket change amounts like you may have in your real life wallet but for amounts like you may keep in a bank or safe. You can use such a process to replenish your phone / desktop wallet as you need.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:20:37
It's not bad for small-medium amounts but if you need to trust it for a significant btc stash then maybe it's worth spending some time/money on better solutions.

To the extent you chose a long random password. If you used a crap password it won't take long to be brute forced.
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:27:05
If you have your seed the you just use File, New/Restore.
Enter a new filename. Choose Standard. Choose "I already have a seed". Enter the seed words. Enter the new pwd you want to use.
That creates a new wallet file that is able to spend. If your system is exposed to malware you could lose BTC by being keylogged while entering a pwd, or by stealing the seed while restoring. Using Electrum offline is defintely safer but also quite a few more steps to set up and use correctly.

It's very unlikely to be on the sim card but why care? You should never use that wallet again anyway. Typically wallets are kept in phone internal flash storage. So they'd have to wipe/factory reset the phone itself (without "accidentally" backing it up first).
Also, why didn't you just keep the sim card. I don't know about where you are but here they're worth &lt;$2. I'd be more worried about them selling it for fraudulent use linked to your id.
@_date: 2019-06-02 01:48:08
It is as safe as the system you run it on. You leak privacy (address/wallet correlation) to servers but they cannot steal your btc. Malware on your system can and does. For more than pocket change you are wise to use a watch-only / offline wallet setup or Electrum with hw wallet or with 2FA or multisig. Many options for secure use.
Electrum is a great wallet but it cannot prevent any of the attacks related to malware, clipboard address swapping without correct safe usage. I'd suggest not using it standalone on Windows desktop because users have a hard time keeping their system clean.
Most btc stolen from Electrum is entirely due to user mistakes like installing the program or updates from malicious fake sites.

Electrum can still open and use old version seeds. It is compatible. I'd never recommend memory as a sole method of storing a seed but it is possible and some people seem to think they can remember that many words easily. Certainly there are plenty of other places it could be stored rather than scribbled on a pad next to a computer or on a hard disk or anywhere so obvious as to be the first place checked. Anyway, you'll note it was not me who recommended memory.

It's one of the oldest most well thought of and proven wallets available. Many "experts" use it around here. Version 2 introduced a lot of new code and support for new features so you could say it is not as well tested but I think it's been put through it's paces over the last 6 months.
For larger amounts you should explore using the offline signing functionality with a secondary (non-net-connected) boot like on a raspberry pi, or even your main system with boot usb stick, eg. [Tails](

You could but why? If it's easy to remember then it's easy to crack, and if it's hard to remember then you're better off using a HD seed word list anyway.
An HD seed is just a random number at it's root and the word list is a convenient way of storing it. If you want to generate that random number using a hash of some other data then you could but it will likely be less random and therefor less secure. ie. It has less entropy then a true random value.

I actually put the project on [my github]( back in April.
It reads raw blocks and txs from rpc. It can actually re-verify them although I recall commenting that part off temporarily. The idea was that with a p2p front end it could be a standalone sql node without needing bitcoind. It could be faster if read direct from dat file but that wasn't the bottleneck anyway.
Some things I did to save space: 
* index addresses on prefix bytes accepting that they could be non-unique and fixing up (slight speed loss for fairly good size reduction)
* a similar approach for txids and outputs, not as simple to build a query but smaller db
* store raw script data in an external blob file so that it could be pruned easily aside from sql 
The sql schema is in repo. Not sure I've updated to latest. It's all work in progress. It's multi-threaded and tries to queue rpc results so it's never waiting on rpc.
Not sure what else now. It's been a while. My github readme says I'm waiting on a new SSD and I did get a new one some time back but have not yet got back to processing the remaining blocks. I was then going to build an api on top for querying similar to blockchain or bitpay but also allowing more complex sql base queries (read only), perhaps for a small fee. Unsure of direction and partly why I have not got back to it.

It's critical to remember that (sum of input amounts) minus (sum of output amounts) is the fee. If you don't **add a change output** back to yourself you'll be giving it to miners. If you leave -json off it will give you the hex tx data but that's not very readable so I'd suggest using -json (the last field has hex data for input to bitcoin-cli for signing).
This [online tool]( is also useful for checking hex tx data you create and some [other pages there]( are useful for manually building txs from inputs. That's a bit easier than using command line but does same kind of thing.

Here's my method using dots and it costs about $2 for titanium and same again for punch, both on ebay. Using dots was tested by JLopp and he commented it was easier than using punched letters and held up well in abuse/fire tests. My use of dots is logically simple (easy to figure out after 10 years) and compact - credit card size for 24 word seed.
I'd highly recommend a spring loaded punch over simple one with hammer (assuming you don't already have, in which case: use what you have). It's lighter and easier and if you don't have a hammer it's much cheaper.

Yes, they would see it tagged RBF. Their main concern would be that you could increase the fee after they accept it and thereby short change them. But you wouldn't get the BTC back. For a large purchase any store would require at least 1 confirmation and probably 3 anyway.

Create another tx that spends the same outputs but with higher fee. Miners will choose to include the tx with higher fee and it will cause the first one to be dropped.

If you're talking about mining then the hashing acts as a kind of lottery. Each miner keeps hashing until they get a valid result - anyone can do that and the likelihood of any hash being a winner is uniform, much like a winning lottery ticket. Only faster/bigger miners make more tickets.
The math behind (sha256) hashing acts as a trap door / one way function that prevents reversing, ie. easily creating a block that matches a known winning value.

Sure, but tons of low fee txs is not what pushes the fee to 600-800 or higher. The mempool could be 99% low fee txs waiting. You still only need to pay a bit more than a low-fee to get in. No one needs to pay 600 s/b to out bid any number of 10 s/b tx. So even if the mempool is 90% full of &lt; 10 s/b then you only need to pay 11 s/b to bypass all of them.

You can select any addresses you want but for this method you do need to know the addresses when you create the transaction. You could choose some specific charity donation addresses. If not that then only other way that doesn't involve a third party (eg. lawyer) is to write a script set to run at a future time that creates and broadcasts a transaction. That's not very robust.

The economy growing is unrelated to mining. 
If you want to mine to help Bitcoin then that's fine but you will lose money at it unless you invest a huge amount in next gen hardware in a location with close to zero electricity cost - because that is who your competitors will be in China or Iceland etc.
So the opportunity cost is that you tie up your money in something that will make close to zero profit vs. buying btc which you have a 50/50 chance of making much more or losing some portion.
You can still support Bitcoin by running a full node on very modest hardware - even a raspberry pi 2.0 will work, though a little beefier cpu is better long term. Also, you can run an Electrum server or build/run other support services on top of that. And buying btc does add to upward price pressure.

Not without the addresses being in the wallet (could be watch only) and requiring a rescan (lengthy process). Or not that I'm aware of. If you run with -txindex then it builds a tx index. I don't think there is a similar addr index option. 
Some months ago I wrote some sql table building code for use on top of bitcoind and at that time the address sql table alone was 2.7GB (with index, using mysql). I'm still interested in working more on that but haven't had time lately. My db schema was pretty good as it actually took less space than the blockchain db and most sql implementations I've read about seem to expand to huge 300+ GB databases. I used several techniques to keep the size down, and with spent output pruning it could be quite a bit more compact than the blockchain. However, building the sql db is incredibly intensive and only feasible on faster SSD drives. 
edit: btw I think the bitpay api uses a ~~sql~~ backend that is much, much larger than the blockchain alone but I've never seen specific details of that.

Whoa. I'm really surprised how slow that is on Bitcoin. It reports 36030 H/s. At that rate forget it even with not so hard passwords. I wonder if that is for some newer and more robust wallet type maybe using PBKDF2 because it seems slow enough for that.
Despite that - Amazing looking system and not something I could afford. Ha ha. I don't know how a GTX 1080 compares to a Tesla V100 or M60. 
I have 3x HD5830 here left over form my mining days. I know they can generate bitcoin keys at ~ 18 Mkeys/s each but they haven't been in a system for 4 years and I never tried them for hashcat (they should work). Cost: &lt;$30 each used now on ebay. Ha.

If your system is questionably compromised you definitely aren't safe by just disconnecting it temporarily. Don't do that.
Get yourself a usb stick, download Ubunu or Mint and make a Live Ubuntu or Mint OS usb stick. Then boot on that. Ideally you'd do it on some clean system but if that is your only choice then go ahead. 
Now you could download and save bitaddress.org and disconnect. Use it to get your key/address but make sure you never connect online again with that usb stick.
However, a better and more flexible choice would be to download Electrum from the official electrum.org web site and use that to create an offline wallet. Again, never connect that usb stick system to the internet again after the initial download.
With the Electrum wallet you can use the offline usb stick for signing txs when needed - something that is hard to do well with a paper wallet. Then save the "xpub" (menu Wallet, Master Public Key) to another usb stick and take that back to your desktop where you can create an Electrum watch-only wallet (cannot spend, safe for possibly compromised systems). This wallet can generate addresses (only, no keys) and receive and monitor btc. It can be used to create a spend tx but it needs to be taken to your offline usb boot stick for signing (while disconnected).
Ideally an offline system would be clean but the next best would be a usb boot stick. If all this is too much hassle then just go buy a hardware wallet (Trezor or Ledger) and be done with it. Safe and easy to use on compromised systems, but more costly.
If you need more detail then google "electrum offline signing" and "tails electrum offline". Tails is good but the pre-installed Electrum version is old and you'd need to upgrade it before using.

Regardless of leverage you cannot make more than the amount you buy (options) or sell (shorting) and there simply isn't that many takers on the market for that. You say $100 million - how are you going to sell $100 million of btc before severely impacting the market, or buy put options of that amount when no one is selling them? Currently on Bitfinex there's a total of roughly $4 million in BTC swaps outstanding. You'd have to somehow sell the entire USDBTC market volume for 10 days running to be able to pull in $100 million. People *might* notice.

Electrum fully supports Legacy addresses. You can very easily create a second wallet that has legacy (1...) addresses and then once sent there just send it on to your segwit wallet.
Also, if you have the private key(s) from your blockchain wallet you can direct import them to an "import" wallet in Electrum and then send from there to your segwit wallet (only one tx fee). You have to prefix the keys when creating an "import" wallet. Choose File, New then "Import bitcoin address or private keys", then when pasting the keys you have to prefix them correctly. Click the "Info" button for how (most likely "p2pkh:").

In theory yes, but no ones does that. Usually private keys are represented in base58 in a standard WIF form. But a key is a 256 bit value and it could be encoded as words. 
My old [keyfmt tool]( could be useful for that. It can take a WIF private key and give you the hex value which could then be passed to a BIP39 encoder to give you words. Note you can't use Electrum seeds because they encode type info whereas BIP39 only adds extra chksum bits (as part of last word).
My [bip39chk]( tool can take hex input and give you a word list.
All of this is at your own risk - check carefully that it works as expected.
Something like this (untested):
`echo -n "5HueCGU8rMjxEXxiPuD5BDku4MkFqeZyd4dZ1jvhTVqvbTLvyTJ" | ./keyfmt "%h" | ./bip39chk -e 24 --`
(on second thought and checking code that actually hashes the hex input so the program would need a minor mod to do what you want).
**edit** I added a new option for direct entropy mode [ -d ] and pushed to github. Now it can do what you want. Use the -j -d options as well as -e. You'll get output like this for example above:
`echo -n "5HueCGU8rMjxEXxiPuD5BDku4MkFqeZyd4dZ1jvhTVqvbTLvyTJ" | ./keyfmt "%h" | ./bip39chk -j -d -e 24 --`
    {
      "derivation": "m/44'/0'/0'",
      "entropy": "0C28FCA386C7A227600B2FE50B7CAE11EC86D3BF1FBE471BE89827E19D72AA1D",
      "seed": "parade position rich border exist champion tent either water wise hawk silent cat clog fossil topic grass lens beauty kick assault cigar elevator alter",
      "seedhex": "7601bbce8fb93ccab8a7cf72d42763f3f9ee2eafd47ee477de3a67d78f19ecaff8b3c9e8e5aa39126fbe4e9e39724df3c7c7e9472a161945ed60d6a4d97aaf4a",
      "type": "p2pkh"
    }
Use the words but ignore the seedhex value. It is the entropy value that's encoded.
The hassle is converting the word list back to WIF key later. You'd have to take the entropy value from above and feed it back to `keyfmt` to get a usable private key again. This looks to me like asking for trouble unless you take some of the code above and make a dedicated tool for going both ways.

So, you'll take something with high entropy and encrypt it with a passphrase of lower entropy so you can remember it? Or you have to safely store your passphrase. If the passphrase is as safe as your seed then why trade your seed for a passphrase you now need to secure, and if it's less safe than the seed, you now have reduced security plus it's in a location where brute forcing may be viable. It's a bad trade off. I'd recommend keeping your seed on paper and metal offline in multiple safe locations and avoid the temptation to store it in online where you must trust others privacy policies.
@_date: 2019-12-08 11:47:28
Most wallets will complete the words with only 4 letters during seed restore. I know Trezor and Electrum both do.

I don't recall off hand if Mycelium has a way to export a private key. But if it does then one way to resubmit is to export the key and create a temporary Electrum wallet and import that key. Then create a transaction spending from the key in Electrum with higher fee.
There are a couple downsides. 
1. If your original trx used more than one input then you need to export/import all the keys to resubmit the same trx, or instead just invalidate the original trx by creating a new one using one key (but presumably with a small amount).
2. Once you export a private key from a HD wallet you risk that key being compromised somehow and that may risk the whole HD chain. So you need be pretty sure you don't have a compromised environment, or only do this with a low value wallet. (Ideally you could use an offline Electrum to import and sign the trx, then broadcast via push service. No doubt more safe.)
Delete (shred) the temporary wallet afterwards as the trx will get picked up by Mycelium when it gets confirmed.

The BIP39 seed (a standard of sorts even though it's quite variable in practice) does not have any version info in the seed. ThomasV felt that was a poor design choice and wanted to allow future wallet software to be able to detect and know what version of a seed was being used. Without version info the wallet needs to either guess or support all possible variants or ask / expect the user to know. So the Electrum seed format is more future proof.
@_date: 2019-06-12 08:32:51
Much of the info presented is good but there are some errors. 
The PBKDF2 / HMAC-SHA512 algorithm actually does 2x SHA512 for each iteration. But counter to that there are optimizations not present in most libraries that can increase the speed for specialized code so that it's nearly even with 1x again. There is a good paper on this [here]( Bottom line is with a high end GPU you can do about 400,000 pwds/s. (I've taken the paper's value and divided by 4 due to SHA512 ~2x slower than SHA1 and 2048 iterations vs. 1000 in paper).
The EC multiply speed is not negligible compared to PBKDF2. You'd expect it is but actually PBKDF2 is not that slow a hardening method (fastest of the 3 main ones). Using optimized GPU code (beyond the libbitcoin highly optimized but side-attack safe code) you can approach 500,000 pubkeys/sec. See another GPU paper [here]( curve). And optimized CPU paper [here](
Based on this my current guess as to brute force speed is probably ball park 200,000 passphrases/second/GPU (given you have to add 2xsha256, CPU-GPU queueing and lookup values in a large memory utxo table in CPU time).  I'm not aware of a paper that combines these parts into one system so my guess is just that - even a bit wild ass really.
IMO the bottom line for a strong passphrase is still minimum 4 words large dictionary, or 6 words BIP39 word list, or 10-12 chars (uc,lc,digit,special) and they need to be random (dice) not user selected. So the article is not off in it's final suggestions.

Every seed can be represented as a QR code. Print it out stick over a small sheet metal piece. Now drill the white spots (or black if you like) with a suitable drill to match the tile size. Spray paint it after, or just leave it white/metal. Now when you want to scan it later you place it over a black/white sheet of paper so the opposite colour shows through.
You can encode/encrypt before making the QR code if you want it to be safe from prying eyes. On linux, 
    echo "seed seed seed" |gpg -c -o -|qrencode -s 9 -o metal.png
prompts you for a password to use, and outputs a png image.

You could do that but eventually you'd be paying high fees and it would cost a lot to carry out the attack (unless you are a miner with collusion deals as I mentioned above; but you still lose on opportunity cost, lost fees).

There are a few ways to spend from that but the critical thing is to be careful about how change (the part left over from your spend) is handled.
Generally people recommend importing the private key into a wallet and then spending from there but not all wallets allow for importing a private key and in most cases the wallet is no longer offline.
My preferred way of doing this and allowing for better future key management would be to create an air-gapped Electrum wallet and import the key into that one, create the transaction and then broadcast it using an Electrum wallet on your normal desktop. This method allows for keeping the key safely offline while still having the convenience of a watch-only wallet on your normal desktop. I can give more step-by-step details if you like.

This uses [Shamir Secret Sharing]( to split a key and later recombine some parts to regain the secret. It's based on polynomial math. I wasn't sure what bitaddress was doing but when I looked at the source code I saw the polynomial math funcs and guessed this is what it's up to.
So... how to use. Generate your parts, say 3 of them, and store them separately or give to multiple people. They are useless on their own. But later you can paste some number of these parts (say 2 of 3 people come together) into the bitaddress window and they can be combined to give you the key again. 
This used to be a bigger idea before mult-sig came of age but now I think mostly people prefer to use multi-sig addresses. But SSS does work and you can do it locally on your computer with various utils around like `ssss` on linux.

Get a Trezor. Currently won't directly work with coinjoin (mixing) but support is in the road map (wasabi, joinmarket). A hardware wallet is physical but the seed word list you write down and store safely ensures that any loss, theft or damage can be recovered from easily. It is much more secure than blockchain.info (which historically has been a crap wallet). It can be used with Electrum, or mobile phone apps, or [web based trezor wallet]( and still maintain security. It is easy to setup, and use and less prone to noob mistakes than other choices.
Bitcoin are always "on the blockchain", not in your wallet. A wallet simply stores private keys used to sign transactions on the blockchain. The critical part is keeping keys safe and that is what a hardware wallet does. 
I recommend Trezor because the people who run it go way back in the Bitcoin community and have a history of being on the right side of debates, trustworthiness and technical advances. But do your own research and learn more before dealing with significant amounts of btc.

Yes, air gapped for security. Raspberry Pi 2.0 is the way to go. Many uses and only about $35 or so. It uses a micro-SD card so very small to hide away somewhere. Make a couple copies and be sure to write down the seed as last resort (eek, my sd card failed!) backup.

Here in QLD, AU they used to give 52 cents/kwh for solar credit and charge you 28 cents/kwh. You could come out ahead. Now if you don't have a grandfathered account you will get at best 20 cents in and similar 28 cents out. So it's pretty much lose/lose now. Some providers give only 8 cents in. We have solar panels so this is from my bill vs. previous owners bill. Anyway, in Vancouver it would be insane because they pay something like 8 cents/kwh and solar would give you little and only 5 hours/day. When I Iived there they didn't have feed in credit and that means double the cost for batteries.

Yup. Your btc is on the address waiting for you. Just import the private key into Electrum and you will be able to spend. 
Or you can use Electrum as your actual wallet.  But if you do that I'd suggest creating a new wallet (default on start up) and send the btc to that. Just be aware that if kept on your desktop/laptop you need to keep that system secure. Don't go opening/running unknown programs, email attachments etc. Also, if you do that be sure to write down and store the seed words somewhere very safe.
It's not worth it for $40 but if you get more then it's worth buying a hardware wallet.

Most routers (without user changes) will assign an IP when a new computer powers up.  Many will try to keep the same IP for same devices unless they run out of them in the range allocated. When you add the port forward in your router settings also have a look for a section called "static leases" or similar sounding. By giving your bitcoin node system a static lease it will always assign the same IP to that system. That ensures the port forward you configure will indeed go to the right system.

A hardware wallet is a convenient way of getting good security. You can get similar security with less convenience by using Electrum offline on a usb boot stick or raspberry pi.

Even a mobile phone wallet is safer than keeping btc on your desktop/laptop internet connected system. Oh, and ya, get rid of shitcoins and stick to btc.

Not laser cutters. Just hand center punch to mark dots in grid thru paper onto metal.
My main "improvement" is using a 1,2 dot pattern to encode letter order in each line. That uses 4x less area. I put the dots for 1,2,3,4 on top each card as reminder of order. In cases where two letters appear together you can just combine dots to make 3 dot pattern. I guess there's a few more "hits" needed but less space.

LocalBitcoins.com is a web site that enables people to trade directly with each other (more safely than just trying to find people on your own). They can enable trades online or in person physically in your local area, ie. at a cafe. This is one of the fastest ways to exchange bitcoins. 
They have an escrow service. So you send your btc to a wallet on their site and when you decide to do a trade it will hold them in escrow until the buyer pays you. When you are happy with payment you click a button to leave feedback and release the btc to buyer. 
For a newbie trying to trade asap this is a good choice but only do Paypal with buyers who have deep feedback and a solid reputation. There are many scammers who join up there and try to entice newbies with a high price for a quick trade. If they're offering you $20 more per Bitcoin then ask yourself why they'd pay you that - oh, maybe it's because they will charge it back and the price they pay doesn't matter.
Good luck.

It sounds like in reverse but that's because the terminology is transaction centric.
A tx output creates a balance on an address (may be only one or one of many). A tx input is the spending of that balance. It's not input to an address but input to a tx, ie. amount being spent by the tx. Checking for inputs is looking at spends from an address. Checking for outputs is looking at amounts being deposited to an address - some of which may not yet be spent (called utxos, unspent tx outputs) making up it's remaining (current) balance.

One way to get it done faster is to plug your disk into a faster machine and let it do the initial sync. Then put it back on the pi for ongoing blocks as it can stay up to date on it's own then. A machine with a good CPU will burn through the verifications much faster.

I've written a plugin (Time Machine) for Electrum to do timelock addresses derived from your normal seed, and also support changing the locktime to make postdated txs that can't be spent until later. It's quite far along and can create the addresses but not fully ready as some issue getting the signing to work right when spending (prob won't work with hw wallet).
You can use [coinb.in]( but be aware you need to use the same tool to spend later - so back it up or pre-make a tx with locktime for the spend so you can simply pushtx it after the timelock expires (without any special tool). You also need to store the privkey and redeem script data.
I think my plugin will be the first simple dummy proof tool I know of. The main issue is that you need to know the time/blocknum in addition to seed to restore the wallet if lost so it is not "seed only" safe. It has a blockchain scan function to allow finding timelock addresses when you know roughly the time/date range as a helper for the case when the wallet file is missing.

Yes. If you do it for yourself it's CPFP (Child Pays For Parent). If you have the option of asking the receiver to spend it with higher fee then that will work too. Maybe you cover their fee later or something. 
The new spend (the child) must pay a high enough total fee to pay a suitable rate for the size of both parent and child. So if your tx is 200 bytes and they are going to spend to a new or even same address and it's 200 bytes, and you wish to incentivize the miner to include both txs by paying 60 sat/byte then the new tx fee should be (200+200)*60 = 24000 sat, or 0.24 mbtc. They must include the parent in order to include the higher paying child.

You don't need proof of work for all blockchains. It's needed for Bitcoin (and others cc) because it's competitive and open/public. 
You do need some consensus rules for a valid blockchain. If the blockchain is being run by non-competitive members then the rules could be different. 
As an example within a group of co-operative members the next block may always be consecutive round-robin based as long as data is valid. That is, you have some data being stored that needs to be immutable. The members storing the data can agree on rules and will enforce them by only adding valid blocks. Bad data is discarded so the record is always consensual. You can come up with any number of schemes for this type of application according to needs of the members. The advantage is that the data is provably immutable - so no member depends on a central record keeper. That aids auditing and fraud detection.
I'm reminded of developing countries where land deed records are often subject to fraud and local official bribery. Many times people can steal land by simply bribing an official to change title and back date records etc. This kind of thing could be put on a blockchain because every local land office can be forced to use validation rules for adding records. They can all have copies of the records but no single office can alter or reverse/back date records. In a case like this you don't need competition to add data. You just need access and consensual validation of following a set of rules.

I did a bit of reading up on MultibitHD wallets. It is BIP32 and uses m/0'/0 for regular addresses (m/0'/1 for change addresses). There was a compatibility bug in early version pre v0.0.8 where seeds were not generated properly. That was about March 2015. If you created the wallet before than and never fixed it then it could still be a problem. It sounds like after v0.0.8 they fixed that issues and wallets should be compatible with BIP39 seeds as well.

I wrote a program that can do that but only with pre-2.8 Electrum. It's on my github [here]( for reference. There is also other tools out there that are faster but afaik only for Electrum and are more complicated to use. 
If you know the 12 words then finding the combo is a fairly small space to search. I wrote a BIP38 cracker too but not sure I ever played around with BIP39. I could probably write one but it's only worthwhile if you cannot find one already available. I have a vague recollection I did write something along this lines so give me a few minutes to look thru my old code here. I'll post it for free if I did.
edit - Ok. Checked my code and what I dug up was a python BIP39 chksum validator using the electrum libraries. That code could be wrapped into a test loop because most of the word combos would not give a valid chksum. The chksum is a pretty fast sha256 test. It can be used to reduce the number of checks that need full "derivation to seed and address" thus reducing search time greatly to something very possible.
@_date: 2019-04-21 08:31:55
I tend to agree with the other post that Electrum makes a better paper wallet than what is typically thought of (single address). It's more flexible than having a single address. Having seed words written down is easier to use later when you want to spend. No worries about sweeping and with change outputs. You get more than one address to use which helps with privacy. As long as the seed is stored safely then your coins are safe. Whatever method you use needs to be done on an air-gapped/offline system so may as well go for this method.

That's interesting. I just ran it on my node and got 53603640 txout count. I guess I would want (txid,n,address,amount) for each. That would be ~60 bytes each or 3 GB, which is about the size of the reported disk size. That doesn't seem like a reasonable amount of data to return thru an rpc call. If that data is stored on disk I'm probably better off accessing it directly. Plus I wouldn't have to use a patched node.  I'm not sure yet how committed I am to doing this but thank you for the info.

The fact you have 3.. segwit addresses as input and only 1.. legacy addresses as output is enough to know the second output is not change.
Are you sure you downloaded and used the real - official Mycelium app? Double check in case someone has made a fake one and it's similar enough so as to confuse users.
Otherwise, it would appear to be a rip off wallet. Mycelium only lets you pay one address per tx (afaik) so it's it's not change then it's malicious code and something people need to know about. It would not surprise me to find out they sold the app or company to get out of the business now and the new owner is 
BTW it's not MyCelium (as in My Wallet) but Mycelium as in the mushroom. So check that when looking at app validity too.

But u/rassah used to be on here a lot and I'm sure he has stated he no longer works for or vouches for them. He is still shown there as if trying to make it appear this team still runs the show. I find that pretty suspicious along with them now listing their Annroid app under the "Mycelium Establishment" company based in Leichenstein rather than the London based company. Maybe it means nothing more than they are structured differently now, or maybe it hints at legal barriers to protect hidden new owners.

You don't need to open an ssh port.
A better way to do this is to use a dynamic dns entry for your mobile laptop/system and configure a reverse tunnel on your home raspi node. Then no open ports and it connects out to your laptop to open the tunnel. Use key auth, not pwds and automate to make robust with systemd service. I use this for btcpayserver but it would work for electrum too.
Another way instead of opening a port is "port knocking" but it may be harder to do depending on home router/network setup. I prefer a reverse tunnel to keeping an open port at home.
btw, electrum-personal-server is easy to setup.

Mycelium seeds are randomly generated and not the same as the usual meaning of a brainwallet, which is a phrase that is hashed. ie. not random at all. A random seed is as secure as a random key (given adequate bit length) but the important thing with seed generated wallets is that you don't expose private keys generated from the seed as one key can be used to calculate others on the same "chain".

The password doesn't matter. It helps secure the temporary wallet you are creating with a single private key. 
It occurred to me you are using incorrect terminology. Do you have a private key or are you talking about a seed word list? A private key usually starts with 5 or K and has many random letters. A seed word list is a list of words but is not the same as a private key.

It is random - actually random, with a statistical average of 10 minutes. This is because the time it takes for a miner to find a valid hash is a process of calculating hashes until a good one is found and there is no way to predict a specific time for a block.

Can you get the address again from bluewallet? Try in in an explorer to see if a transaction exists on the bitcoin network. If it shows up then you are likely waiting on confirmation. If not, then it should be in your mycelium wallet still. 
If that is crashing then either something got bunged up or maybe you were using a fake Mycelium. Try to verify that you have the real app and not some fake. If valid then I'd suggest trying to get the MPK (xpub) from it and restoring that in Electrum or another wallet to see if you can verify history and balance.
Hopefully that adds clarity as to wallet balance. You can restore from seed in Electrum if need be but be careful about system security. Ideally do it offline, or maybe use the Electrum Android app. It can restore a BIP39 seed too. Anyway, try to verify the wallet history/balance before going to the stage of restoring from seed.

Your wallet should show the tx as unconfirmed. Not all wallets allows spending outputs from an unconfirmed tx but the bettter ones do. So what you can do depends on your wallet. If you are not using Electrum or another one that allows spending unconfirmed txs, then it may still be possible to fix but it depends on compatibility and being able to move the seed over to one that can. In any case, all you need to do is spend some amount from the unconfirmed tx to another address in your wallet and be sure to include a fee high enough to make good for both the new and the unconfirmed tx. When the miner sees the new higher fee it will include both txs in order to gain the fee.

Is it full wallet file encryption or just seed/xprv encryption? I think this became an option at some point and before that full encryption was not available. 
My recollection is that electrum takes the pwd, hashes it, maybe adds hardening with pbkdf2 and then uses that as AES key. I'm not 100% sure but I think that even knowing both input and output data you can't reverse AES. Even if feasible it would only work when not using full wallet encryption. It would then give you an intermediate state (key) which would require custom code to re-use on the second wallet. It's a long shot and I don't know enough about AES to say it's possible.

I believe back then there was no full wallet encryption but I am not sure. If you knew the version that created it then it should be possible to check the release notes going back. But still, even so, I think it's pretty unlikely to work.  
You are probably better to spend time and effort on figuring out the correct pwd. If by luck it was a version 1 wallet then there are cracking tools that support that. It was much less secure and armed with hints on the pwd tools like Hashcat or JTR may work.

People here can't help you with your email access so they are responding the only way they can - telling you not to use this wallet in future. Besides the problem you have now this wallet has also had numerous bugs and failures over the years. It's not well liked.
You said you have a count down time on a 2FA request. I'm guessing that is a request using your email since you never mentioned other 2FA like GA/Authy/SMS etc. In this case I'm also betting that it's waiting for you to respond to an email for 2 days, 2 hours etc. If you can't get into email then that will just timeout and you will be back to square one. I doubt the company will help as that would be the same as helping out a hacker. Other than email they have no way to know who you are. Allowing some new email to gain control would allow a hacker to do the same.
Doesn't blockchain.info give you a seed word list as backup nowadays? I know they didn't in the past before they became HD capable. But they should have done that when creating the wallet and if you didn't write the seed words down you basically only have one way to get in - get control of the email account again. This is, comparatively speaking, a moderately costly lesson in the unforgiving nature of bitcoin security.

For the expense of a steel wallet it's probably a better idea to store a seed value for a deterministic wallet (Electrum, Trzeor etc). But you can't really give that to a third party safely. You could use a BIP38 (encrypted) key and then decrypt it with password and use the result as a seed value. That way it's flexible for long term use but also safe for a third party to make as long as the password is sufficient.

Not sure why you say that. You can place the data dir files provided for bitcoin1.conf and start that node. Then create a bitcoin2.conf and start a second node that only connects to the already running node (using connect= conf option). This one will sync from the first one. It will have it's own new data dir and build a new blockchain that it has verified. 
Once the second node has fully sync'd you can stop the first node and delete it if you like. You can alter the bitcoin2.conf to run as a normal node now with internet connection (instead of single connect). 
Or since the second node has in fact verified all blocks of first one you can now trust the data dir of the first node and just delete the second node instead. This makes more sense if the second node is pruning (saves disk space as you don't temporarily  need full second copy).
I have actually done the above setup for a dev need I had a while back. I had a full node but needed to test my software with a pruning node. But I didn't want to fully download the blockchain again. So I ran a pruning node which only connected to my full node and had it sync locally (no internet download). The connect=... conf file option tells the node to only talk to the indicated node rather than to more peers. It gets all blocks from just the given peer.

You may want to look at my [sqlchain]( project. It parses blockchains and builds a mysql db. It's written in python and supports multiple coin types with a plugin type setup. It also can use about half the space of blockchain and works with pruned nodes. It does take a long time to sync to sql and needs an SSD for decent speed. There is an installer with several coin types available but it's also easy to extend to more by adding a few values and possibly sql schema overrides etc. Also provides an api layer for building custom apps, explorers or whatever. It can read the blk*.dat files directly so that it can sync even while node is still syncing (which normally stalls rpc calls). Can also use ZMQ to keep updated for light overhead. New blocks sync in less than a second typically. Also tested with MyRocks engine which provides smaller db size and faster sync.
I have tested  several years ago with sqlite3. You will find before it gets near 70% thru that it becomes unbearably slow. It cannot handle large datasets very well due to index insertion (as best I could figure out- I'm talking &gt;60GB data). I should update mine to also use Postgresql but just haven't got to it.

You can write a fairly simple script to iterate all txs and add addresses to a mysql db. Then you can use the %like% comparison operator to match on address prefix.

Sweep can work but it is not the same as sending. It will only sweep into your current wallet. If what you want is to simply send it to some given address then follow these steps.

2. Choose menu File, New/Restore.
3. Enter a new wallet name. Doesn't really matter what, eg. "oldcore". Click Next.

5. Paste the private key. Click Next.
6. Enter a password if you want one. If you don't intend to use this key again then don't bother.
7. Electrum will sync and show any tx history and balance. Click "Send" tab.
8. Paste your destination address in "Pay to" field. Select a suitable fee. At this moment I'd suggest between 6 - 10 sat/byte. Click "Max" button. Click "Preview" and check all looks good. It should have 1 input and 1 output going to your chosen address. Click Send.

Anyway, the blog post gives details but since I use this with my server I didn't need dyndns to keep the name lookup fresh.

That's not what it means at all. You can have all the entitlements in the world but with bitcoin the whole point is to "not trust but verify". So NOT depending on outside authorities to support your rights. 
Other than "nice ideas", "rights" are only useful to you if force can be brought to enforce them. The idea of "Not your keys, not your bitcoin" is that you have physical control and never need to depend on authorities or claim "rights". 
It's come about because of years of bitcoinners getting burned by supposed property rights at exchanges that fail, exit scam, hacks etc. But it applies also to legal situations where clients have no recourse other than very long lawsuits costing thousands paid to "others" to help enforce their rights.

Ok if it starts with a K then it should be a proper key. If it syncs (green ball icon in bottom right and status line says "sync'd" or similar - and has no balance then it has somehow got the wrong key. 
If it's not syncing (red ball icon) then you can try several servers until one does sync. The network is quite poor now due to DDos attacks on Electrum servers.
If that's not the case check that the single address in the Address tab matches the one you have from your old wallet (that you also pasted in explorer). I presume it is wrong or else it would show your balance.
Assuming wrong address then it seems you pasted the wrong private key. In Bitcoin Core you can use dumpwallet command to show all keys in the wallet. I don't have it in front of me so cannot recall now the correct way to dumpwallet and check which key/address has the btc in question. The private key pasted into Electrum needs to be the one that has a btc balance. There can be multiple keys in core wallet.

If this is for security reasons then you want to have **no private keys** on the server. From my looking around (which is out of date perhaps) there is no way to do that with a seed (HD) based wallet as it needs the xpriv to generate addresses (hardened). 
But you can do it by generating addresses elsewhere and importing them into the wallet. Since you are talking about a pruning node you need to import them before any txs occur or else rescan back to whatever height to get txs. You can import addresses with the **importaddress** rpc/cli command. You could import a batch of thousands if you like to allow for some future time period.
One way would be to setup an air-gapped offline Electrum (perhaps using a hardware wallet) and safely store the seed. Then generate as many addresses as you like and import them using a script into your pruned node. You can also use the xpub in a desktop/online install of Electrum to monitor transactions (assuming you are ok with privacy loss or that you use EPS on your node). 
Of course, running a full node with EPS and Electrum on your desktop is another way to do this without bothering with generating/importing because that is exactly how EPS works anyway. You give it the xpub and it generates and import the addresses into the node. Then you use the Electrum client to monitor and provide a GUI for the node's wallet.

There is a number of ways. The way I would probably use is to ssh into the cheap one and then from there do an rsync from the other one. This only requires knowing the user/pwd of both systems and having ssh running on the servers. That is usually the case anyway. For a simple example, lets say you are logged in to "cheap" using ssh and want to copy data from "fastcpu" to "cheap", and that data is in the current default location of /var/lib/bitcoin. You probably need to do this as root, so:
    sudo rsync -arP fastcpu:/var/lib/bitcoin /var/lib/
(the a means keep file attributes/status, r means recurse, P means show progress, so it will list each file being copied, speed etc). For the size of data involved you probably want to do this with servers in the same data center that have a gigabit backbone. Doing it across the internet in different cities is likely to be much slower. If you don't have "fastcpu" in your hosts file or assigned a DNS entry then you can just use the IP address in it's place.
If you need to do it using a gui interface I'm not sure if there is sftp clients that can do that - maybe not. I always use ssh anyways, so not sure.

Transactions do not contain IP data. So the only way to see who sent a tx is by actually being connected to every node and recording the one which first sent it. After sent it gets relayed by others. So if a node gets a tx and relays it to 8 more then very quickly the origin IP is lost. Spy nodes try to record first seen tx IP info and presume that is the original sender. That may be true or it may be implicating the relaying node when the original node is not tracked. By having a ban list more nodes are not being tracked and the lower chance that a first seen tx IP is the actual original sender. So it does not require that ALL nodes ban these spies but only  enough nodes that it becomes statistically useless to claim any tx originates from a tracked node.
But anyone truly wanting to send anonymous txs would definitely use an onion node anyway. So really this just enhances the overall privacy of the network rather than specific users desiring anonymity. An onion node uses other means to hides it's origin IP.

I thought of that too but the idea is to not need any software or computer when viewing your word list from a hardware wallet screen. I came up with a [4x improvement]( in density. By using a two dot indicator of letter order, eg. 1 dot = first, 2 vert = second, 2 horz = third, 2 diag = fourth. Sometimes you get two letters the same in word and then can just combine to make 3 dots. This uses one line per word, so easy to fit 12 or more on a credit card. And easy to "read back".

The closest thing to "sold out" is when holders get so tight fisted as to not ever sell. Well, as you'd expect there is always going to be some who will sell at a high enough price.

If you create a native segwit (bech32, bc1...) wallet then there are still many services that cannot send to you. It is improving but will take time. 
Of course, you can create two wallets in Electrum and give p2sh (3...) segwit addresses to those who cannot use bc1 and then send the btc on to your native wallet. As for sending from native segwit there is never any problem.

Vultr.com - I have used for a couple years and been very happy with performance and reliability. And they take bitcoin. You can start a large VPS (per hour billing) and quickly sync the blockchain and then remount the data on a smaller node for $5/mo.
With a pruned node you only need small disk (SSD) space but it is useful to use a faster CPU/RAM allocation for the initial sync. Their control panel is easy to use and allows starting/stopping VPS as you need, billed per hour. In fact, you could only run the node for a brief time each day if you wanted to save money. That would require uisng VPS snapshots, which are free.

Fraction of addresses having a balance = 2.1 x 10^15 /  2^160 = 1 / 6.96 × 10³²  
You would have to test half this amount for a 50% chance, or 3.48 x 10^32 addresses.
Current hash rate = 397,920,877 GH/s = 3.98 x 10^17 double hashes /sec. Which is meaningless in address mining because to find an address you have to do a EC point multiply, ripemd and two hashes. But since we're being silly let's just say the point multiply and ripemd can be done as fast in a pipeline as the hashes, and therefore we can generate addresses at the current hash rate.
Then we could test 50% of addresses in,
3.48 x 10^32 / 3.98 x 10^17 seconds, 8.74 x 10^14 ~= 27.72 million years.
Accounting for 2% current growth every 2 weeks, 1.02^26 or 67% / year lowers this somewhat to **6.48 million years**.  ( 1.67^N = 13.86 or log(13.86) / log(1.67) )
And it assumes you can look up and compare addresses as quickly as hashing, which given the database size of 2.1 x 10^15 entries is very, very unlikely (but maybe somewhat possible with a gargantuan memory store and banks of futuristic ASIC comparators operating at a combined 4x10^17 cycles/second). 
All for 1 satoshi potential gain. ***Inconceivable!***

I checked the code. Would you be ok with me submitting a pull request that wraps the bitpay request, along with playnice, into a single call that can use rpc or the api? 
On second thought it may not even be feasible using rpc. It seems to require a full address index and a full node doesn't have that (unless eg. you build a separate sql index, which I did but have not updated for months). So using this locally probably requires a sql extension on top of a full node.

If you go to the address list in both wallets the list should match or something is wrong. The address shown on the "receive" tab could be different perhaps but both should be amongst the address list. If "Addresses" doesn't show as a tab then choose menu "View", "Show Addresses". Also, "Show Coins" is useful as the Coins" tab shows which addresses currently hold the outputs making up your wallet balance.
Ideally, for security, your seed will never be entered into any computer connected to the internet. Your watch-only wallet allows creating a transaction (tx) but it cannot sign it without the keys. So doing "offline signing" means creating the tx in your watch-only wallet and then saving (click "Export" on "Preview" tx screen) to usb stick and taking to an offline system for signing. 
An offline system is one which is not connected to the internet. That could be an old laptop, desktop or simply a usb linux boot stick (cheap) that you plug in and boot on while fully disconnected. I've used the latter for years but also used a raspberry pi connected to a TV. You install Electrum onto your offline system and restore the seed there. That system can sign a tx but not broadcast on the internet. So you once again save (click "Export") to usb stick and return to the online system to broadcast.
It sounds like a lot of work but it's not. It takes more time to exlain than to do. It's worth doing a few test runs to know how it works and see that you can do a signing in 2-3 minutes typically.
@_date: 2015-07-28 02:21:31
There really is no individual coins involved. When you make a transaction you are combining various inputs (previous trx outputs received) into a sum total value, which is then distributed as outputs. You sign the inputs proving your ability to consume them, and create new outputs indicating the addresses which will have the same ability. Typically one output may be under your own control (in your wallet) as "change" (think in a store when you spend a $10 bill and get change for the overpayment, but with Bitcoin there are no preset amounts). So the blockchain maintains a ledger of transactions not of coins.

If you don't want to d/l the blockchain then I'd suggest installing Electrum ([official site]( You can import the private key into that and will be able to send easily. It is also a good wallet for general use (better than an online wallet but only if your system is secure from malware). Once installed just choose File, New Wallet. Select the last option "Import wallet - addresses or private keys" and paste in the private key. It will sync quickly and you can send.

Electrum works very well offline on either old laptop, raspi or even just a usb stick.

@_date: 2019-04-13 23:13:33
You can do this easily with Electrum. You may have to do it in several batches as I'm not sure you can do a single tx with that many outputs due to total size.
Put many address,amount separated by comma in a file one per line. In Electrum, click File icon in Pay To  field on Send tab (you can copy/paste too if you prefer but I'm guessing you have a db you'd export from), and then select filename. It will add as outputs and you can fill in other details. 
In older Electrum versions it was a separate Tools menu item but you shouldn't be using older versions now.
Oh, and do this when fees are low. They tend to [cycle up and down]( and you can save a lot by waiting for a good time.

You can (and should) save bitaddress.org to your local system as html file. Make a backup too. Then it's available regardless of what happens to the site. This page is wholly self-contained and can be opened and used from your disk.

If you can get the initial blockchain some other way it may work good enough to keep it sync'd but unless you don't want to use the internet for anything else for a month then "No".

I guess I could see it being attractive to some users if it was a heavily pruned chain, say 5GB download. If you're going to download the whole 250GB I'd say just do a normal sync.

This sounds like a terrible way to hide keys. It is simply security by obscurity. He claims "experiments" show it is secure but there is no security.

@_date: 2019-04-12 03:11:22
Can mix. Should help.
I doubt you can figure out algorithm from list of addresses.
As long as algorithm is deterministic it should work. The usual algorithm (say bip39) allows finding a key/address for any index N, but it need not be that way. By making the key N depend on key N-1 you would have to generate all keys for &lt; N to get the key for N. Which in this case means needing to know the seed key for  to get the rest. So if that is destroyed and only the hacker knows how to generate it then there's a high likelihood the list could not be recovered later (assuming it's destroyed after being used).
Headlines just occurred to me as possible (partial) input for a seed. Maybe not a good choice. I suppose the blockchain itself could be used along with some other data. The problem I was trying to solve was how to generate a unique seed or limited set of seeds without having to store it in code or call some server that could disclose identity info. I mean maybe some bare bones tor code could be integrated and then a hidden service used but then why not just use that and never generate a local address list... I'm sure there's many creative ways and I haven't given this more than a passing thought in posting here.
@_date: 2019-04-23 23:46:09
I agree. But in the case of a platform like TDA it goes a step further. If they don't allow you to withdraw BTC then you have no way to be sure the trades executed have an impact on the wider market. So millions of clients can buy BTC and it doesn't move the price up. Since they can't withdraw any sell they make also is with other TDA clients so it doesn't move the market down. At very least there needs to be settlement to the wider market or else it's fake. TDA won't get rekt because any trade is always with other clients at "external" prices. But customers are pretty much trading derivatives at this point since their trades can't impact the market. It's probably a lot more complex and risky for TDA to settle trades to the market so there is some incentive not to do that. At least that's my figuring of why it's important that clients can gain physical control.

I used that for 9 months until it was so pitiful I had to turn it off. I also had one of those USB dongle miners. Still do, and still have the GPUs tucked away in a box with the dusty ASIC board.

Not sure. But I know the raspi can take a very long time (weeks) to do the initial download and sync and a fast system can do it in 5-6 hours. It's fast enough to keep up with a block every 10 minutes, on average. Anyway, the "on disk" data is the same. So if you create a bitcoin dir and sync into that then later plug it in to the raspi as long as your directory setting is right it should just keep working.

First, for clarity, there is no encryption involved.
Your wallet has a seed which is used to generate a sequence of private keys. Those keys are used to generate addresses. When you receive btc what you actually have is a tx record on the blockchain with "outputs" (or **utxos**, **u**nspent **t**ransaction **o**utputs) on one or more of your addresses. Your private keys can be used by the wallet to sign txs that spend those outputs. 
So what the wallet software does is combine as many utxos as needed to cover the spend amount as "inputs" to a new tx. The outputs of the new tx will be the destination address you give plus one of your addresses for change (left over, because it cannot split utxos, much like you cannot rip a $5 bill in half). All that info is formatted together and "signed" using your private key (one per input). Once signed it is impossible to change. It is then broadcast to the network where other nodes and miners will validate the signatures and add to the blockchain. Rinse and repeat.
So a wallet balance is the sum of the utxos of the addresses in your wallet. It doesn't matter whether your wallet has millions of addresses (like exchanges do) or just one or two addresses. A transaction (tx) is simply a bunch of inputs and outputs, signed. A signature is a mathematical operation involving EC (elliptic curve) math that can be checked for validity without having the key.
Once you get a significant amount in btc I'd recommend getting a hardware wallet and keeping your btc yourself rather than depending on an online wallet. There has been a history of online wallets failing and custodial wallets (where you do not have the keys) are prone to theft and lock downs.
Your best source of more detailed info is the [bitcoin wiki]( It provides details of tx formats, how signatures are made, op codes for the scripts etc. Also there is a [dev manual]( that is useful too.

Maybe you just have a "brainwallet". You can try it on bitaddress.org as that site was popular back then for those. But ideally save the page locally and open on disconnected system (if you think it's valuable). Anyway, you can also just run sha256 on the words at command line or with some utility. That will give a private key value which could be converted and imported to a wallet. Well, prob just easier to try bitaddress and then plunk the address into an explorer to see if it has any btc on it. If it does then move it right away to a new wallet, eg. electrum, as brainwallets aren't very safe.

It doesn't look different but on the same line there will either be another pattern for 1 (one dot) or another pattern for 2 (2 vert dots). Which ever one is present tells you this L is the other. ie. there cannot be two first or two second letters. So you can use the exclusion to assign the L to the opposite. If one dot on line then L is 2,4 but if a 2-dot-vert on line then L is 1,4.
To be honest I have not checked all words for any possible collisions. I could throw together a python script to do that. I did convert and check my 24 word seed and found no collisions there. Only one word had an L as above.

A wallet is software/hardware for holding your private keys so that you can create/receive transactions. 
You do not need to register or open an account with any third party or service to have a wallet. Some sites would like you to do that and be custodians of your bitcoin. That is an option but not the best choice and certainly not required. It is the worst possible choice if you want to maintain privacy.
On the other hand most exchanges, which let you trade bank money for bitcoin, will require ID verification. But even so you can withdraw bitcoin after buying it and send it to your own wallet. There are ways to get bitcoin without giving up ID info but you will need to do more reading and it depends a lot on where you are located as to how easy it is.
Others have already posted info about recommended wallet software and I don't disagree.

See the bitcoin wiki [transaction]( page for actual format. There is a signature required for each input to a tx. Validation is done by first checking the format is correct and then using EC math to check each signature is valid. It can only be valid if the correct private key matching the address was used. Every node receives, validates and relays txs onward. 
For the most part, many here don't have strong technical knowledge and cannot clearly answer your questions. Those that do may not bother or aren't online now or didn't see the questions.

Addresses (and private keys) are generated from your seed value (word list). They can always be generated at any time because, well, *math*. So they are good and always good but re-using them associates transactions with each other and so reduces your privacy.
Not just with your Nano but any HD (hierarchical deterministic) type wallet.

You only have taxes due if a gain has been realized. So if you bought it for $10 and then later sold (or spent) it and got $80 for it then you have tax due on the gain of $70. If you just bought BTC and then spent it at the same value there is no tax due because you presumably bought it with already taxed income. Sales tax is a different thing and may be charged by the vendor depending on whatever laws they have to follow. In many cases online it's not charged but that is changing.

Yeah, No. It will be done by using cracker software, either ready built like JohnTheRipper or custom coded. To give you some idea of numbers involved - normally the BIP39 list is 2048 words. So having all those in your book means maximum 2048^12 possible combos (allowing for re-used words, which is typical). That is 5.45×10³⁹ variations - a really big number equivalent to about 132 bits entropy (if I did that calc right). So lets say your book only uses 120 of the BIP39 words available. That means only 120^12 variants (less if no re-used words), or about 8.9×10²⁴. That is only 82 bits entropy, which is considered fairly breakable. Try to have more words than that out of the 2048 available. Or add a passphrase of some catch-phrase/slogan or relevant text from the book, eg. "winter is coming".
I suppose I could throw together a small python script to count BIP39 words in your text if that would be useful and if you know how to run a python script. A  bit easier on Linux than Windows... but then, what self-respecting bitcoiner uses Windows?

Simply stated a raw transaction is just the binary data (sequence of bytes) that make up a transaction *as it would be* when broadcast on the network. That means having the data allows it to be simply broadcast at any time when desired. There are web pages online where you can paste a raw transaction and click to broadcast without having a wallet or node or anything.
A transaction depends on inputs. If an input get used in another transaction then it cannot be re-used in the pre-made raw transaction  being held. So to ensure the transaction data can later be broadcast it is necessary to make sure new transactions using the same input(s) cannot be created. This is done by destroying the private keys.
As for purpose of doing this - it sets up a situation where only a pre-agreed upon (signed) result can occur. Since keys get destroyed it is not possible to change the outcome. Of course, that means being sure or trusting the keys really are destroyed. Depending on multi-signature setup that may be hard. eg. 2 of 3 signing means that if 2 collude to not destroy keys then they could later create a transaction to alter the result.
There is another situation where this can be useful. When using a timelock address (CLTV) you can create a raw transaction for later use that spends btc after the lock expires. Then if a certain condition does not occur that would move the funds as expected you can force the result you pre-made.
I'm sure with a bit of creative thinking there are more situations but they are not the normal everyday uses. You wouldn't do this for just buying items or sending money home to family etc.

If you mean blockchain.info then I haven't heard much lately. I used them back in 2011 when it was quite different. Over the years they have had some serious breaches and bugs that have caused people to lose money. I don't have specific links at hand. I'd suggest doing some research on past hacks/failures, or maybe someone else with links will chip in here. It is not a preferred wallet by most long time bitcoiners due to past fails, large bank or venture capital funding, qualms about ownership (though I don't know if Roger Ver still has a stake) and general bad air.
The most popular open source wallet and the one I've used since 2011 is Electrum. It gives you a lot of control and features, is open source (verifiable), community developed and supported. It may be a bit confusing for noobs but that fades with more btc knowledge. It can be used in many ways, eg. desktop, mobile, offline cold storage, hardware wallet. Due to it's popularity it has recently been target of DDos/malware attacks. So if you use it be absolutely sure to only download from [official site]( and verify file signatures to ensure you haven't received a fake. There is a reddit for it: I use a Trezor with Electrum as my preferred choice after 8 years using Bitcoin and never losing a single satoshi to theft/hacks. I also connect it to my own full node with electrum-personal-server for better privacy and validation of transactions. There are many wallets and almost everyone has their own preferences. It's probably not worth buying a hardware wallet (~$69eu) unless you intend to have much more in value stored in it.

There is no way using only Bitcoin. You would need to use a third party service to push pmts. 
The closest on your own is to pre-make raw transactions and then broadcast them at future times. You could automate this using scripts and timers on your own system but it depends on that setup being robust. ie. power or system failure or hacking or just internet outage may result in no pmt. 
I'm not aware of any software for this. In theory (non-robust) it's easy enough to pull off. You have a string of raw transaction data and you need to post it to a "pushtx" url at some future time. There may even be a generic "future url call" web site out there. 
If you set a **locktime** in the tx it can be prevented from being accepted on the network until a given block/time. If you use CLTV in the tx you can prevent it being spent until a given block/time. Neither solve this situation on their own.
Even setting up the raw txs is a little complicated. You cannot use an input in future that has already been used. So if you were going to make 6 future pmts you need 6 inputs ready that will be intact in future. You could make a tx to pay 6 addresses in your wallet (split) and then make 6 txs spending from each of those in future.

So is the 3BU... address yours? I mean does it show up in your wallet? Because the btc are still on that address so if they aren't showing in the wallet then it's just a case of not being sync'd / updated to the network. If that address is not yours then it would appear you sent to a wrong address. It could be a clipboard malware if you copy/pasted it. Anyway, the btc are shown on that address and either it's yours or some thief/error. I don't use a Ledger so not sure what you do to list addresses but I'm sure there must be some way to check the address is part of your wallet.

You shouldn't have a fixed single address. Your wallet lets you generate a new address for each payment coming to you. That's not to say you can't re-use addresses, just that it's better not to as it leaks wallet info to others.
Most wallets now are HD (hierarchical deterministic). That means they use a seed value plus math to generate a sequence of as many addresses as needed. The same address set will always be generated from the same seed value. Since there is no cost to giving out an address for each tx it is better to do so.

The people I see as conservative seem to always want to control things more, restrict more, stop people from doing whatever makes them happy. Aren't religious nuts usually conservatives?

Hard depending on word count. The first step is to reduce the 80,000 words to a unique word list - probably only ~2000 words or so, total (guessing). Then you have to choose between two options - either you used BIP39, so you can throw out all words not in the list, or it's not, in which case you keep them and don't use BIP39 for the seed (ie. non-standard).
In the case it's a normal BIP39 wallet then the difficulty depends on how many boiled down words are in the BIP39 word list. So the best way to make it tougher is to check [the list]( and make sure you use as many as feasible in your book. I've no idea how many are already used but they're pretty common words so it's probably easy to mix a bunch more in. Also, I guess you could add a passphrase to the BIP39 wallet and that would make it tougher - then they can't throw out all the words not in the list but have to cycle thru them as well. Harder.
If it's a sha256 hash based key (a brainwallet) or seed then the cracking is probably much faster but the difficulty depends on the total unique words in the boiled down list. I'm guessing you didn't go this way (non-standard) but if so then add more unique words to your book as sha256 cracking with GPUs is very, very fast. Maybe hundreds of billions hashes per second depending on power thrown at it. Crackers can start up cloud GPU arrays on per hour basis for this.
edit - I guess a third option would be using an Electrum seed (which is not BIP39). In that case the boiled down list could be compared to the Electrum list and go from there. I think it's more difficult but not sure. There is John the Ripper and/or Hashcat modules available for Electrum cracking but I believe it's still pretty slow.

Yes, it could do that. But statistically you'd have to be very, very lucky to succeed. What is more likely is generating passwords/phrases to brain wallets as the search space for that is much smaller, and often very limited by users poor password choosing skills. The problem with using GPU farms for attacking addresses simultaneously is that it takes far longer to check the address "hit list" than to generate a key (in such a farm).

It doesn't really need to be printed metal if you just laser print the layout. I have one of those spring loaded center punches so may just go free with scrap metal.
One bonus to this is you can use scrambled letters as very simple encryption - one time pad. But don't lose the pad then... I'm curious though. Usually a one time pad is secure but when there is a limited word set I think it may not be hard to crack the pad.
edit - Holy crap man. $62 for a couple pieces of metal. I guess that's for people who like nice stuff. Here's [my solution]( (doesn't preview right but text aligns in Inkscape) - 12 words per face on credit card sized hunk of metal. Free, if you have scrap and a drill / center punch. This is more high density because encodes letter order as simple pattern. One line per word.

From my reading you could encode anything, though maybe it's limited by reasonable image size or resolution during retrieval. I'm pretty sure you can store a seed. 
If it's encrypted first, and assuming the encryption is strong, then sure, it makes a pretty way to store a seed and not have it look like it's a seed. You can hang it on the wall and people unaware it could contain data will not know. As long as the method is reliable for retrieving the code from the image then it's fine.
There is fairly simple steganography tools for storing data in any image. So you can print and hang a picture of the mona lisa and it could have an encrypted seed too. I don't think all methods can work like that. Some depend on pixel data being intact and if printed then they likely would lose their data as scanning will depend on light conditions etc. Anyway, just some thoughts. I'm no expert on this.
@_date: 2019-04-12 03:59:36
Ah, I see. Yes, a good coder should be able to figure out the algorithm from the code. And assuming you know the one address used for theft you should be able to find all in sequence after that. But if the malware used a unique seed then you probably can't link addresses from other thefts - well, perhaps a group could combine all the known addresses with same malware. The smart thing for the malware to do would be to destroy it's algorithm code when enough addresses are generated, and destroy those  after use too. That's on the assumption that once stolen from the user is going "fix their system". If the addresses are stored masked/encrypted then I guess just destroying the mask/key is enough and much faster. I don't think anything like this is full proof.

Yes. From what I've read this will allow automated signing when a tx is presented that outputs to the wallet the same amount as sent (minus some fee). A tx like that would be presented by a mixer as part of ongoing mixing rounds thus not requiring a user to be manually confirming txs (which wouldn't work for some common use cases).
The benefit here is funds are kept secured where currently a hot wallet is required. Likewise for some automated processing on LN.

Yes. You can write a fairly short python script that reads the addresses and checks them against the blockchain. Ideally you'd run your own full node but it's also possible to use the api of some explorer like blockstream.info. They likely have a usage limit and you'd have to stay within that or spread it over several explorers. But best way is to install and sync your own bitcoin node and then pass the addresses to the rpc interface. Anyway, it does take some coding but nothing extraordinary.  
I wrote a compact blockchain [explorer in python]( that runs on top a node and can be used to do this but use ~50% less disk space (takes longer to sync fully). It uses a mysql database and you can query that directly for address history/info. I guess it depends what kind of output you want.
I also wrote a script for doing much this task for a client. It allows adding a huge list of addresses to a sqlite database (import, say) and then it monitors them for any txs. It has a web interface for adding addresses in bulk, showing tx history and plays sounds when something happens. But that isn't open source as it was contract work.

And they'll be frustrated by how slow it updates every time they start the client, especially if they don't start it very often. I'd suggest a short list of both well known hosted wallets and thin clients like Electrum, and then a note about supporting Bitcoin with Bitcoin-Qt, why, and expected behaviour.

That msg appears to be related to a java module in the code as found in the [github repo]( That makes me curious if building the github code to make your own Mycelium would result in a wallet that shows the correct balance?

I presume he could run a second bitcoind connected to the first one and have it sync from block 0. I mean I've done that myself here and it gets every block from the local connected node and then verifies the whole thing over. After that he can delete the first. Granted it takes double space (unless the second is pruning in which case he could delete the pruned copy after it verifies the full one).

Electrum has quite a few features that the core node is missing. HW wallets support is one but also many extras built into the interface. Also a compatible Android wallet.  
You don't have to use Electrum but if you are using it then running your own EPS allows you to use it with your own bitcoin node for more privacy, supporting the network more and not being susceptible to problems like the current DDos.

Bitcoin addresses are not tied directly to a real world identity. After all, they are derived from a long random number - a private key.
Potential methods for making that link include:
* the address is posted publicly somewhere, eg. forum, web site
* the address was used in another transaction that leaks identity, eg. a merchant
* the address is in a wallet with others and becomes linked via change outputs
* a pmt made from the address is recorded in server IP logs, eg. electrum log, web wallet etc.
* an eavesdropper on your net connection records transaction data
* a bitcoin node records transaction data source IP (altered code)
Off the top of my head - anything else I missed? There ought to be a well thought out comprehensive list made somewhere with specifics and not hand waving.

For block verification you'd be talking some huge size because right now a block on average every ten minutes only takes a few seconds to verify. So not being able to verify would mean some staggering block size. It's hard to imagine a block that takes ten minutes to verify (before another one comes) but I suppose it could happen. If they get queued then it should catch up. It may not handle queueing now but if blocks were large like that, then this would be a useful improvement. I'm running two nodes now and both on low grade hardware but neither spend much time verifying. I thought the bottle neck would be relaying transactions, or for miners, listening for transactions to add to it's block, and that's the case where it would just drop some when too busy.

I don't think it could scale out very well as is. But I do believe with steady growth the developers can find ways to enable higher volumes. I doubt that it will ever be the largest part of a world economy but I could see it being comparable to a medium sized country eventually. It could be a backbone that glues together many different systems.
I think limits on network communication and data storage may come into play before the 8 decimal point limit. I expect as that time approaches developers can evolve the code to handle it.

It'll be interesting to see how that pans out. I somewhat doubt the CC companies will understand enough about Bitcoin to validate the key, but also even with a key it's easy for a recipient to claim the funds were removed by someone else. The seller still needs to be trusted as they could empty the key after delivery.
What they really need is foolproof delivery using the split-key method used by vanitygen. 
I programmed a web site based on this and it does work, and is easy to use. A customer can login with their pass phrase which, like a brainwallet, generates a key-pair in browser. The public key is sent to the server as identity token. The site generates a seller-key based off this public identity-key, then funds the address, and provides the resulting seller-key to the customer. 
The pass phrase provided by the customer generates the identity-key which is combined with the seller-key to allow transferring the funds out to their possession. It's impossible for the seller to steal back the funds and only the person holding (or compromising) the pass phrase can access the funds.

If you mean how many hours for the initial sync then it depends on which level VPS. It was over a year ago but I seem to recall it taking around ~8 hours on a fairly high end one. It would be longer now as more blocks are added. Looking at their plans now, I think it may have been the 4 CPU/8GB one at 6 cents/hour. I also ran it on their bare metal at 18 cents/hr, which was faster. I'm not even sure now but they only have those in some data centers.
The process is to simply start a high end server costing, say 6 cents/hr. Set up the node with pruning set to some size that will fit on a small VPS. Run the sync for whatever hours. In the same data center start a small node, copy the same config and adjust it for less memory. Copy the sync'd data across to that node and let it continue. Then shut down the high end server.
Once on the small node you can do a snapshot whenever you want and power off. Then later start a new server using the snapshot and it will continue syncing from where it was. I've used this method for dev work on and off as I needed. If you want it always up then it's $5/mo. (which is 0.7 cents/hr). But if you only need it now and then it can be pennies/hr. as needed.

Not just possible but in most cases likely. Transactions very often have multiple inputs and multiple outputs. If your collection of inputs all have small balances then it can take many of them to make a useful output. In that case a fee is usually required to offset the size of the transaction.

It probably matters more about how much you buy. I could see someday the govt auditing some exchange and being quite interested in users depositing and buying large chunks of coin.

Personally I think developing the person2person exchange network like localbitcoins and otc is very important to keeping bitcoin going under adversity and I'd like to see that develop. eg. It seems like a natural fit for every pawn shop out there. I could see people take in their stuff and get bitcoin in exchange. 
And there's lots of other scenarios. I used to run a used book/record shop 20 years ago. I guess that kind of thing isn't as popular in a digital world but if I had it now I'd offer to buy books/records/cds for bitcoin.

vanitygen has an option -P that allows you to provide a public key as input. vanitygen will generate a vanity key derived off this other key such that you cannot use it, but the holder of the original key can. 
The process works like this:
1. Joe wants a vanity key but doesn't want to trust you will destory your copy after generating for him. So he creates a key pair (using bitaddress.org for example), saves the private key and gives you the public key in hex format.
2. You pass it to vanitygen with -P option. vanitygen generates an intermediate key. You give this to Joe.
3. Joe plugs it into a re-combiner app like "keyconv" (that comes with vanitygen, or bitaddress.org again (see vanity wallet tab, which can be used offline for security). This tool "multiplies" the original private key and the intermediate key forming a new key (that you never saw and cannot know). This final key magically has the vanity address requested.
Is it a bit convoluted? Yes. But it does work.
(I created a point click easy web interface to this that requires no trust at all to generate vanity addresses. I was going to run it  as vanitycoin.com but after polling interest on the forums it looked like no one really wanted to use it anyway. Project canned, for now, but I have the working code still.)

What if you rolled 3x for each hex digit and applied mod 16 to the sum?
Well there is base number converters online. So you could just write down 99 dice rolls and then plug that in to give you hex. Good for when you're on a desert island and only have a pair of dice. Of course, you'd be better off rolling pairs 50 times, and jot down base 12 values.
And then there is this:

Thx for posting. I know you aren't to blame for this list but I'll comment anyway.
Some of the figuring in that chart is just wonky. eg. What's $14.99 fee for ATM xfer? I've never had anything so high and I xfer to foreign ATM often. It usually costs me $2 plus the local withdraw fee, and the exchange rate is always better then WU, balancing part of the fee. What a poor attempt to clarify the costs. I disagree with comparing to "best value" rather than listing actual total cost for each method.

I can think of two off the top of my head. First, they could pre-generate them and fill hard disk free space. Then just look up the address when needed. 
Or, they could do the same elsewhere and then do the look up remotely via simple query (probably use fake  DNS lookup with udp to port 53 - unlikely to be blocked).

With a deterministic wallet (like Electrum) you can backup all your wallet keys/addresses with just 12 words, probably less than 100 bytes total. If you like you can jot down those 12 words on paper and put in your safety deposit box (if you're the type that trusts banks). Then whatever happens to your wallet in the future is easy to restore no matter how many addresses or bitcoins you have, no matter what happens to your wallet. You'd be wise to encrypt it to prevent a hack accessing the wallet but when you use the seed (12 words) to restore the encryption doesn't matter so you can *forget* the password. It's pretty darn amazing.

Aren't we talking about someone or some company that's running a web site and could accept donations via Bitcoin. At least I thought that was what I talking about. The decision maker can just tell whoever admins the web site and it should be very easy for him. Easier than, say, registering a domain name. And this is in the context of whatever security they implement for their other donation methods - they should be able to secure a small piece of text. But granted even some web admins have been proven incapable in the past.

It seems to me another way to tell is by the significant digits. A lot of the time the payment value will be a small number of digits (eg. 0.1, 0.53 etc) whereas balances quite often have more digits, especially when originating from pool mining. 
Since we now know most 2 output transactions have change in the first output it is feasible that analysing this would tell us other differentiators that can be used going forward, even after the bug is fixed. So an analysis may be able to state with X% likelihood that the more sig digits, the more likely it is change value.

I thought the question was "can we revalidate the blockchain data given someone on a hard disk" and this demonstrates how it can be done.

blockchain.info has an import key feature. You should be able to just copy/paste the hex string in there. In the wallet select the import/export tab and paste the hex string into the "private key" field. (Just tested this and worked fine). It will show up as a new address in your "receive" tab. If you export or backup the wallet that address/key will be included.
bitcoin-qt has an import feature as well which on the recent version can be accessed via the debug console (and I haven't used that for a while so forget exactly how to get at that now).
electrum has a cmd line option for importing keys as well.

As is common they mis-use the term money laundering when they should actually say "money hiding" or "tax evasion". Bitcoin doesn't help at all in terms of making income look more legitimate - which is what laundering actually is (ie. cleaning the money). 
Privacy is illegal when it comes to money - that is the underlying ruling that the big banks want applied worldwide despite all sovereignty.
The root of all the hysteria over "money-laundering" is that the big Wall St. banks depend on the reserve holdings of Joe Public, rich and poor, worldwide, and any competition is hugely detrimental to their survival. Any method of holding, hiding, transferring value outside their control is tantamount to economic terrorism.

Just use the standard bitcoin core wallet. You may want to make the external drive bootable with a Linux OS. That way you plug it in, boot on it and it's entirely independent of whatever the system is running. Otherwise you can install software to the drive but it will need to match the OS of a system you plug it into, and it won't be as secure or independent.
It's pretty easy to install, say, Mint or Ubuntu onto a hard disk. Then install bitcoin-qt and let it sync. Each time you boot on it later it will take a while to catch up (sync) but not that long if it hasn't been offline for a long time.
The bitcoin-qt wallet is not known to be the most flexible and full featured so if you want a bit more capability I'd suggest installing electrum-personal-server on top and then Electrum wallet. You still have a full node but with the added capabilities of hardware wallet support, and more. Plus you can access the node from android Electrum or other desktop Electrum clients (world wide if you configure suitably).

They often have "labels" you've given to addresses or comments. Sometimes other preference info is stored. Typically only the private keys are movable between wallets and even then not so easily.

Or maybe something like the tipbot here. Users deposit a small balance on your site, you take a small cut, and they can "one-click" tip songs they like.

You have to have a private key (64 hex digits) to match and control an associated address. But sure, yes, get to it. See how many collisions you can find before you die, frustrated and worn out.
It's not immediately obvious to non-math types just how big a 256 bit number is. And hence to guess correctly the same one matching another address is incredibly difficult. As I mentioned above if you can correctly guess every outcome of 128 rolls of a 4 side dice then you can have the money.
To give you some idea of scale there are programs (vanitygen) for generating key/address pairs. You can run them on high GPUs and generate millions of keys per second (mine does about 20 million and I have 3, and there are faster ones than mine). And this program gives you a time estimate to find a given address pattern. If you ask it to find more than about 7 or 8 digits of the 31 digit address then it will estimate many years. eg. I just plugged in this,
1Frankenstein... as the start of the address I want.
It tells me I have a 50% chance of finding it in about 6373331 years. And that matches only 12 of the 31 chars in any known address.
The final point here is that it's very easy to create a BIG number but it's very hard to guess an existing unknown one.

What do you mean by "ping the list"? Do you have the list data or is it on the net somewhere? If you have the data it's probably easy to figure out if you also have the malware code. It could be encrypted or just obfuscated in some way but probably boils down to records of fixed 20 byte binary data. That is what addresses are in most compact form (ie. not base58 encoded text). To save space it's also possible to store as a tree structure, though exactly how much that would save given the effort to traverse the tree is questionable.

I don't think it's that far different. Spending dollars for bitcoin makes the dollar worth less because there are now (even more so) too many dollars supporting the economy in dollars. Once that economic value moves into bitcoin the Fed would have to remove dollars from circulation to balance the lower economic value, but they won't do that, which compounds it's inflationary bite. The more bitcoin subverts fiat currencies the more the central banks will mistake the parameters and be already inflating more than even they think. 
I see it as two sides of the same coin. When people are willing to buy a Bitcoin for $1,000,000 it will be evident that they don't value dollars much any more.

It's calculated in the client - see main.c line 1055 of reference client.
Clients that do not agree with your client will ignore your blocks. So a majority decide when blocks change difficulty by each client extending the blockchain only with the blocks they accept.

You can use Electrum over Tor as it has socks support built in. Also slush operates a hidden service Electrum server node. (Or at least he did, I haven't checked in a while) The info on that is below. I tested it once and it worked. Electrum can be used via cmd line if you have server tasks to automate. It can also be run as "cold" wallet by de-seeding the wallet enabling a watch only mode where a hacker could not send money from it.

That's exactly why many have taken the risk of pre-paid pre-orders. They want to be the first to get them and reap that advantage before others. As soon as they are put to work the hash rate will rise, and within two weeks the difficulty will adjust for the rise. That narrow gap is when the first owners can mine at the lower difficulty, and after that it will jump up and balance out over time. Eventually everyone will use ASICs because GPUs will be comparably slow as to make diddly squat. By that time the difficulty will once again fully reflect the spped of ASICs in use and *should* make the proft margin comparable to the past. 
With ASICs the electricity cost is less but the difficulty will eventually balance this by making miners need more hash rate for a given profit value.

I think you're making an argument from the perspective of Bitcoin being the sole mandatory currency. It isn't and will not be. Bitcoin is not good for banksters who want to exploit usury to feed off the work of the people. I'm quite happy if they never find it profitable to use Bitcoin for this. 
The entire foundation of Bitcoin is to be a **fixed supply** currency and *store of value*. There has never been any kind of coercion involved to make it a mandatory or sole world currency. Let the banksters continue to milk the fiat currencies into oblivion. If people want to continue borrowing fiat money and spend their lives paying into the coffers of the rich, then I'm not going to stop them.
This currency is one designed to be good for those holding it, and like gold/silver were it will be used for trade when appropriate, but given it's design why would you not complete your purchase of 100 btc?

Given that Bitcoin-Central doesn't hold any license at all and has just partnered with some third or even fourth party that does, and that this party is actually already and has been a bank - I don't see this much different than any past exchanges like MtGox, etc. Don't they have a partnership with their bank as well. 
The only difference I see is that instead of a single account they have arranged a deal where customer funds are segregated into their own individual accounts at the bank. This is good, of course. But the real news here is that there is a bank that was willing to undertake this type of arrangement when most just want the exchange to be like any other customer.

Retailers need to mark up more in an inflationary currency to account for the loss of value of the currency. In a stable currency they would mark up for less. In a currency increasing in value they could sell for the price they bought at and still be ahead since the currency has increased in value. By holding stock and trading in a deflationary currency the stock becomes a store of value, assuming it does not spoil or lose desirability, which is what I would want as a retailer. Really this just about people being so used to an inflationary currency that they have fixed their whole world view around it and work with prices and markets as though this were the only possible way it could work.
I'm happy to use a currency that the rich and powerful cannot continually meddle with to their own advantage. If other people want some then that naturally increases it's value. Anyone who truly believes in free markets would naturally be drawn to Bitcoin as one of many available currencies. Eventually only the ignorant would hold their wealth in a continually inflating currency.

It's not that every satoshi has an id. But when a block is created there is a transaction that invents some btc (now 2500000000 staoshi). The ledger tracks every split and merge of that btc as it passes thru every following transaction. Since the smallest countable unit is satoshi that is in essence what the ledger tracks over time. They transfer from address to address over time, some may be linkable to people, most are not.
An address has ownership in the sense that it's private key is required to validate transfer from the address. Any bitcoin value transferred to the address is therefore controllable by the holder of the key. But counting past numbers has no relevance. You're free to count as high as you like, it won't help with manipulating bitcoin value.

Speed isn't a big factor. Looking at recent stats a client only transfers around 500k/hour, so on average that's about 140 bytes/sec. ie. not going to require much overall bandwidth.
24/7 isn't going to make much difference (for you) either since when connected you will update yourself fully, and you'll still maintain a copy of the blockchain. But more hours is better in general for overall connectivity.
It's good if you can have your client "listen" and on a home connection you typically have to port forward from your router to your bitcoin system to enable listening. By listening you become a node that others can connect to and query. Without that you have to initiate connections out to others. I'm not sure how much that lowers your service level to others but I believe new clients need to connect to a listening node to get going. Right now about 25% of nodes are listening on average, and it's better if this is higher.
btw although a miner creates new blocks you do act as an archive and relay for blocks and pending transactions. So your presence helps ensure overall integrity to the extent that your client behaves "correctly".

You should check LocalBitcoins.com if you haven't. They have escrow to prevent fraud.

Even the ones who don't pay for electricity will have a hard time continuing. Just how much noise and heat, wear and tear, will they put up with for a diminishingly small reward? Now, I'm only getting about 3 btc/month. But if ASICs do come out and this dwindles to a measly 0.1 btc/month, even with free electricity I wouldn't bother. Well, unless the price went way up. I'd be better off selling ten dollar bills on eBay, or whatever.

That's a pretty serious cut. I think there are one or two exchanges that offer WU withdrawls. MoneyGram is as good as WU (and cheaper) if you can find someone to send that.
You might try to make a deal on bitcoin-otc with someone that has a solid reputation. If you trust them and send btc first then you shouldn't need a reputation of your own there. You can usually find an email address for trusted people there via their gpg key with a key server. Or you can chat directly to arrange it.  on freenode. 
With that high a value you would want someone with a good solid history. There are a fair few there but the person would have to be willing to do the WU stuff. It's a bit hit and miss as sometimes it takes a while to contact and arrange something with a reliable person. You don't want to just trust any user with that amount and no backup plan in your position.

They don't even need to do that. Since they woudn't get any Bitcoin anyway there is no harm in just **posting an address** and letting any donations sit until they feel like bothering. By that time maybe the price will have gone up. But if not, well, without the address up there they would never have got anything. 
It's not like, right now, having an address is going to divert much from other methods by users who don't know about Bitcoin. If I were any of these sites I'd just add an address to the trailer next to copyright info. Anyone who wants can donate.

I think BIP38 had some implementation flaws back in the day. Not sure that bitaddress had a problem but some software/sites did. Your best choice is to make a new offline boot usb and test that you can decode the key and re-generate the address. You may even want to make a test signing to be sure. Personally I would move the btc to an HD wallet (Electrum) or hardware wallet.

Just visit bitaddress.org. First page has a random address. Copy/Backup the private key. Copy/Paste address into web page. I believe that is the most minimal simplest way. 
Or you can paste in your favourite lengthy phrase into the brainwallet tab and get an address derived from that. This way you just need the phrase later to get the key when you want to spend or cash in the donations.
No need for any account or wallet, or downloads etc. 
("maintain that inbound address indefinitely" - no such thing or need for that, as long as you have the key or can generate it you can always access the address balance)

Fastcash4Bitcoins has sent me money by ACH quite quickly many times w/o hassles. They even have overnight if you pay something like $10 extra.

@_date: 2019-04-12 00:39:44
Sure. Sounds like a good way. The addresses generated from a MPK are as random as any and so should have as good a "spread" of target addresses. I mean if I were doing this I'd maybe do it this way. The only thing is exposing the MPK in the code is not ideal. When inspected, even with an encrypted MPK, the full address list could be found which may make it easier to track funds. I guess after a theft succeeds the data could be written over to prevent tracking or it need not follow any standard algorithm and each address could be generated from the last so that the MPK is only needed for the first (and then destroyed). It's unlikely after a theft the same ploy would work again on the same victim. Of course then you'd have to generate a MPK on the fly so as to not have it encoded in the deployed malware. It could be generated from public data that changes (headline hashed) but is the same for both hacker and victim at certain time intervals. Anyway, just ideas.

If you're going to transfer them right away (which obviously you need to do) then why bother with a key when an address is just as good and much easier for a newbie to deal with. To use a key they need to import it somewhere and send to another address. 
If they import it into their own wallet then there is the potential for future re-use of the address. So they should use a throwaway wallet for that. It just all seems like more hassle and no benefit.

I think they had bigger issues with IP blocks. But otherwise assuming they wanted to continue I think they made a mistake. They could have put some energy into truly helping their customer base transition to Bitcoin. They could have explained why they may shutdown and downsized instead, offering help to users. No doubt they would have lost a large percent of their users, but some would get it and using the simpler Bitcoin tools like Coinbase and Blockchain.info or BitInstant or BitPay they would continue and over time their business would build up again and they would be at the very forefront of something that ALL download sites are eventually going to have to deal with. The writing is on the wall from Paypal and CC companies.
They took an opportunity to lead rather than follow, and threw in the towel. Maybe they already made enough and didn't want to continue, or couldn't see downsizing as a bridge strategy to later growth. I expect within a few years there will be a BIG download service using Bitcoin and/or Tor because that's the only way they can side step financial censorship. It won't be these guys.
I know of a way around IP blocks for file transfer and hope someday to get it working coupled with a Bitcoin pay-per-file hidden service.

There's been a few attempts on the bitcointalk.org forums to demonstrate how big the 256 bit key space is. It's huge. And its' true that as more people use Bitcoin and more keys are generated that the chance of collision increases. But the point is that this chance, even after all that, is incredibly tiny. I think a few of the more amusing comparisons were in the Deep Space Vagabond thread, though I haven't gone looking thru again. You may want to browse that thread for amusement. It's about a screen saver someone made to spend all it's time searching for collisions.
2^256 = 1.158×10⁷⁷ or
1,158,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000... plus 47 more zeros... 
If everyone one had a billion addresses that would be ~ 6,000,000,000,000,000,000 addresses.
Meaning the chance of guessing any other persons address would still be,
1 in 193,000,000,000 plus 47 more zeros.
So if you check 193,000,000,000 keys / second then you'd still be in for,
3,170,979,198,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years to hit a used key in this key space.
Now maybe the scale hits home.

Well, I agree with that. Unless they value the anonymity of mining coins it's silly to do it below market price.

Bitcoin is NOT pegged to the dollar. It fluctuates on it's own and has risen over the last year. A currency is only "pegged" when some external entity can act in the market to maintain a fixed price. eg. Most fiat currencies. 
Just because Bitcoin can be traded for dollars does not make it pegged, and it will always be the case that as long as people use fiat currency they will need to trade between them and there will be a price expressed.

@_date: 2012-12-02 05:38:56
Not for long, and not unless you have already pre-ordered.
Once ASICs come out the pre-orders get shipped first. Those users will push the total hash rate up causing the difficulty to follow. The higher difficulty will force most GPU mining to shutdown since they'll be losing money. Expect the difficulty to eventually be 30x or more higher than now. 
Right now most GPU miners are borderline profitable unless the price goes up or the difficulty down. So if you haven't already been mining and paid off your hardware then you should probably just buy Bitcoins from someone else rather than mine. At least until ASICs pre-orders are all active and you can re-evaluate the profitability.
When I plug my hash rate and electricity cost into a mining calculator today I get a cost per BTC of $10.21. With current market being $12.56 I'm using my investment in hardware to save me $2.35 per coin. But I've had my rig for 18 months and it's long paid off.

No. You would put the miner in an air flow box outside so the wind can cool them. Using the air con would only increase the fuel bill to mine. 
In physics we have a law that says you don't get anything for free. If you are using 2500W of power then it's coming from your fuel bill. You can use conservation of energy to determine exactly how much. 1kwh = 3600 kJ. 1 gal diesel = 146000kJ. So approx. speaking 2500W is using about 2.5*3600/146000 = 0.06gal/hr. (I used round numbers and hopefully didn't screw it up) ie. 1 gal/16hrs mining. 
I doubt very much at that energy cost you can make any profit at all. Mining is finely tuned to be barely profitable at the world's best electricity rates and this is not that rate. According to google diesel is on avg. $3/gal now so your effective rate is $3/16 or $0.19/hr or $0.075/kwh. I heard that in China they pay 0.02 but not sure if that is still the going rate.
ps. I neglected efficiency as well, which is pretty bad. This is a best case and it could easily be double or more.

After reading some others here I'd like to add a few comments.
* A Bitcoin is a metaphor rather than a specific thing. The closest to physical I can think of is that it is a **"quantum of satoshi"**. It is created as a transaction output and consumed in a transaction input but only exists as values associated with an address.
* A wallet is a collection of private keys. Since the public keys and addresses can be derived it's not strictly necesary to store them. Each client may have different other details, such as transaction history, and labels in it's wallet but the only critical data is the private keys. A deterministic wallet is one where the keys can all be generated from a single seed, thus allowing it to be saved/copied as a single value. A brain wallet is a misnomer for a key that can be generated from a memorized text string (usually by using it's hash). A paper wallet is one where the keys are printed out (typically for storing in a safe place or passing manually between users offline).
* The balance on an address is derived from the series of transactions involving the address. There is no single balance value recorded except as calculated from traversing the blockchain.
* Electrum is an excellent light weight client that allows new users to get started with Bitcoin without the burden of a blockchain download and has many features. It isn't as fully independent as running Bitcoin-Qt but it is less centralized than using an eWallet. 
* Hopefully going forward you'll have better experiences with Bitcoin. It can be daunting at first. It's so diverse and "wild" because one single entity doesn't define and control it. It's the opposite of an Apple product that is designed from scratch to be soft and cuddly. Often the problem is that new users get dropped into the deep end with Bitcoin-Qt and are expected to swim when it would be much smoother if they were introduced via Coinbase or Electrum.
@_date: 2012-12-04 04:28:35
It's going to be some time before you can get your hands on one of those. It may be a month or even two before they ship. First the pre-orders will get filled and that will drive the difficulty way, way up. So you won't be able to evaluate the power vs. return correctly until after that point anyway. My guess is that it will eventually balance out to moderately profitable but you will be competing against professional miners who may live in regions with low electricity costs.
Possibly you could buy someone's pre-order and get in early. I'm not sure how many miners are selling theirs but you should be aware that some people believe the ASICs being hyped up now either won't come out, will come out very late, or with lower specs than expected.
The current situation with GPUs is that you may break even or make a little depending on your cost but this is something you can currently evaluate. Now you would want to run a GPU rig undervolted at lower than max clock speed to get efficiency. If you primarily want to learn about Bitcoin and mining, or just a few btc, then using an available GPU is an ok idea.
As an example data point I run a small 3x5830 rig, undervolted, getting 760 MH/s @ 375W. At my cost of 0.13/kWh and $12.50 market price I make $4/month net. Woohoo. 
The heyday of mining is over. Unless the market price takes a sudden jump up, in which case the gamble pays off.

The character set is not all chars but rather a special base 58.
eg. from a python convert function, 
b58 = "123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Legacy addresses start with 1... P2SH/Segwit addresses start with 3.. and bech32 start with bc1...
The length can vary a lot. Even short ones can be valid so I wouldn't set a minimum length. 
bech32 long fmt can be up to 90 chars and is not base 58 but rather alphanumeric excluding 4 chars.
I don't have a full list of other address types but there is a page listing many altcoins. I'll see if I can find and post here.
[This page]( gives more info on bitcoin and all prefix letters.
edit - [Altcoin version mappings]( Note text table near top extends far to right so I'd select and copy out as text file for easy viewing. At least that helped for me.
@_date: 2018-11-08 03:09:24
I guess there's some semantic distinctions needed. 
Most altcoins are created by copying the Bitcoin node software and making a few changes to identifiers and rules. Some make more changes and deviate further from Bitcoin. Running that software creates a node. When many users run nodes it forms a network (the node software handles peer-2-peer communication).
You can also write software that interacts with a node, doing pmts, writing contracts or just information manipulation/lookup. 
I don't know much about eth but I believe the contracts are actual script code that take the place of transactions. I'm probably a bit off or maybe too simplistic there. I recall reading that in eth the scripting allows for branching (turing complete) whereas bitcoin does not.
Bitcoin does have simple "contracts" as well. The P2SH tx type allows multisig, which is a simple contract allowing for M of N signatures to send pmts. A pmt is a type of contract allowing change of ownership of btc by a valid key holder (signor). Applications can automate these things dependent on the network to validate and accept txs.
I think with eth (or maybe other coins) they depend on an "oracle" for contracts to make decisions. That is, some external software running somewhere which is trusted to provide correct answers about real life conditions.

I've used both but always felt a bit safer and more in control with Electrum. I don't know it's any better so it's probably just a subjective thing. I also figure using Electrum is one step closer to supporting the bitcoin network. Both rely on a server but Electrum allows for many independent servers. This implies running more nodes on the network, and I run my own on my server (just for fun, not because I have to). Also, using Electrum means that my wallet is getting backed up every day with my automated backup system, so this is part of having more control.

The network hash rate is currently 55,180,134,658 GH/s. That means a full nonce range is fully scanned approx 13.8 billion times every second by the network (in aggregate though - it's not like miners coordinate exclusive ranges, they actually are mostly hashing differing arrangements of data). You should view it as a statistical problem rather than the input values being important (well, it has to be valid of course).
Hence, your chance of finding a valid hash in any nonce range is very, very small. You are mostly concerned with changes in other input data but you still need to cycle each range. In practice letting the fast hardware cycling the nonce range gives some time to build and hash the other data. You would have each chip in a large bank doing one nonce range and assign differing extranonces across chips, or banks of chips. Or whatever scheme works as long as little time as possible is wasted between changes.

I don't think it was ever done because BIP38 got a bad rep because of poor implementations and vagueness in the spec. BIP38 encrypts 32 bytes and MPKs have 78 bytes. It could be modified slightly to simply encrypt more bytes. I'm not sure that's the best way to do it and maybe the devs who work on BIPs aren't convinced either so never put forward proposals. It would be nice to have a way to standardize encryption, I guess. 
But on the other hand it doesn't really matter what method, even BIP38, as you still need to leave instructions. No lawyer doing this is going to inherently know what to do and if they by chance were expert in Bitcoin they'd probably tell you what they like doing.
I personally just write down the seed words but if I were to want to encrypt I'd probably just use GPG and print a QR code (and test the reverse). I think it is important to keep it simple and use common standard tools. BIP38, though a standard, is not that commonly available. I mean it is findable (eg. on github) but it's not installed by default on all linux distributions worldwide like GPG. Well, I'm a 100% linux guy so this suits me and I don't have a lawyer.

Ultimately code changes are decided by node operators not coders. Central bankers have no input there, and they have little say in anything. Which is why they will choose to make their own shitcoin before using Bitcoin. They could make their own node version and try to get people to run it in hopes of overtaking the network but I see little hope in that being effective.

True, and I don't know what chip he's referring to specifically. It's fairly unlikely the SHA hardware would be highly optimized and adaptable to the double hashing pipeline required. Generally a chip like that would be designed to optimize encryption thru-put as the hasing for most applications is not like mining. What may work is a second generation of mining chips that use a newer technology, though I'm not even sure what the current crop are actually being based on - it's probably not Intel's latest.

This site works by associating addresses via trx details. That is, in many cases you can algorithmically determine which output is a "change" address and then assume that change is returning to the same wallet. Repeated trx using same addresses can leak associations. Also, it assumes all inputs to a trx are from the same wallet. Using CoinJoin / Mixing can disrupt such assumptions. There is no built in value in an address that indicates which wallet it belongs to. Careful manual selection of trx inputs can help prevent associating addresses as a wallet.

Oh, bitnodes won't see you because it cannot connect to you without an open port. You still connect out to the network nonetheless - by default usually to 8 nodes. Your node will build a list of peers and use that as nodes it can network with. 
I guess if you want to be counted on bitnodes then you'd need to fwd a port. I'm sure there are way more nodes out there not counted.

It never gets created. You can create up to 12.5 btc in current blocks but if you only have a coinbase output of 5 btc then the other 7.5 btc never gets created and never will be. It still would validate as a block since rules only limit the coinbase output value.

Install Electrum. Import the address and use it as a watch-only wallet. It will sync it's entire history, which may take quite a while with so many txs, and then in the history tab you can see on any date what the balance was. That's about the simplest way to do this that comes to mind.
On the Wallet, History menu you can export to csv or do other stuff like Filter txs by date, or even "plot" them.

Use Electrum. It's great. 
Lightweight, nice interface. Actively developed and getting better.
Encrypted wallet but also can be regenerated from seed only (as long as you don't import addresses from Qt). So if you save the 12 words seed then later you can re-enter them and get the wallet back even if wiped out due to crash etc.
It has SOCKS support and can be used via ssh proxy or Tor.
Also has some cmd line functions that enable using offline.
I switched to it a few months back because I could no longer put up with the blockchain size and delays every time I started it. I'm very happy with it. Just always be sure to back up any wallet and/or seed.

The way bitcoin signatures are created they contain the data needed. When a signature is checked the result is the address which signed it. So you would compare that to the expected address. I was unsure about this but checked it in the code on brainwallet.org and this is how it works. It's also how the electrum code verifies a signature. It only uses the address as something to compare the result against.

(2) There is no guarantee or even likelihood of an valid block in any given nonce range. 
(3) This is true if you update the block data you are hashing but doesn't matter except if you stopped hashing to update the data and so lose time doing hashes. Since a valid hash is unknown with a statistical likelihood the chance of it occurring in any data is the same. You are as likely before the hash input changes as after it's changed. In practice miners don't update the block they mine so often that it truncates nonce ranges and would sync new txs arriving in the block and push them down with either time or extra nonce changes.
To clarify too on your original statement. When you find a valid hash meeting the criteria you don't get automatically confirmed. You broadcast the block to the network and other nodes validate and add it to their chains. It's entirely possible and often happens that other miners find a block at nearly the same time and also broadcast a new block. Some nodes may have your block and some theirs. Only when another block is found may this be resolved and one of the two gets orphaned. This is why it takes 100 blocks before the coinbase (miner reward) is spendable - to allow for short term chain splits but also as a defense against more sustained attacks by miners.
Also, only the merkle root is hashed not the whole tree, but same effect.

You have some confusion there regarding paper wallets and deterministic  wallets. They are not the same. A paper wallet is simply a printed version of the key pair, sometimes arranged in a nice graphical form and /or with QR codes. A deterministic wallet is one where a seed value can be used to create all the keys in the wallet which is quite indepedent from whether it is printed or not. You could print the seed (either the hex value or word sequence) to have a paper deterministic wallet, but as generally used paper wallets are usually printed key/address (often with QR codes to make re-entry easy with a camera).

Vultr.com - accepts bitcoin. I've used them for a couple years and their servers have been solid and also perform better than AWS for less money.

Plus they're been pretty easy to deal with and helpful support wise. Quite a few nice features like snapshots, local DNS, cheaper block storage.
My only complaint bitcoin wise is they use Bitpay and last year when fees were high I had to use Paypal because Bitpay add-on fees were ridiculous. If they switched to their own Btcpay server (I mean they have some to spare) then they'd be close to ideal/awesome.

If we can trust that X number of devs get the same result for the compiled program, why can't we trust when X number of the same devs publish a hash of the same blockchain?

A good way to make it more efficient would be to design a miner that outputs a high heat per unit area so that it could be useful for heating water. However, that would require a technology that can itself withstand high heat and silicon (afaik) can't reach 100C and still function effectively. People have hot water tanks (except much of asia/europer where they are more efficient with point of use heaters) with resistive elements that could be replaced by miner bars. It would be strange to see steam powered devices that boil water with miners but it would actually put that energy to work.

There are a few ways. None are really ideal. I understand why Electrum doesn't support it but I don't fully agree and think it would be better if an option. I've done it myself two ways. My current one is using a hardware wallet. In the past I have used [iancoleman.io]( offline and I've also used dice to roll one using [diceware]( With that method you can roll dice and choose words, then finish the last checksum word by trial in the Electrum restore process. It works, even if unconventional. At least it's random. 
After that I went for a year with an Electrum multisig offline+online pair. That was a hassle so eventually I just got a Trezor when the price dropped. 
I'd only suggest BIP39 if someone is worried about compatibility. Personally I think an Electrum seed has enough longevity and is fine. I always seem to redo wallets within a year anyway.

Yes. It still connects out to other nodes and relays txs and blocks as normal. What it doesn't do is listen for unknown/random peers to connect to you. This means new nodes starting up cannot connect to you directly. You should use less bandwidth and don't provide as much to the network as you could. Your blockchain is still fully valid and will update as quickly as any other node. If you have great unlimited net speed then it's more helpful to others to fwd your port but it does not affect your node's functionality.

You could do that but at this time it would make very little profit. If you want to get bitcoin then this is one way without going to buy it. This is assuming about 0.13 USD / kWh electrcity cost. 
A 5870 typically gives about 400 MH/s and at todays difficulty level that would net you about 0.06 BTC/day, 0.4 BTC/week, 1.7 BTC/month. You would want to decide depending on how much you pay and plug 400 MH/s into a mining calculator.
Also you may want to run at below max speed, under volted, to get better efficiency. This will lower the cost per BTC but generate less total coins.

If it were happening the price would go up. The reduction of supply that would have made it's way to the open market will increase demand on exchanges. If it's happening now then it's being moderated such as to keep the price steady and absorbing what otherwise would be price drops. From the recent market you can only infer that it isn't a more substantial buy in.
It's not instantaneous so it's hard to tell until afterwards. Like after each halving it takes quite some time for the reduction in miner supply to show up as price increases - months or longer. Larger randomness in the market can hide or offset the effect.
Well, that's my theories anyway.

You could use a pruning node on a smallish vps. CPU speed will matter more than disk space and ram, though usually a VPS ties them together. You don't even need to do it in advance. Just record the block number at the date-time required. Then any time in future you can sync a node to that exact block and stop. You will have a network snapshot as of that block time. The utxo set is in the chainstate directory. Whether you can prune or not depends on exactly you want to query and how.
I have written a [sql layer]( on top of the blockchain and that may come in handy if you want to query the network state at the that block. It does take a long tme and fast ssd to sync the sql to the blockchain but if you are only concerned about recent txs for some time period before the snapshot time then it now has support for only doing sql sync on recent blocks and that is quite fast. If you have more questions just ask. On the plus side my layer can store a sql version of the blockchain in about half the space of the full blockchain.
edit - I'd just add that I'm not aware of a way to stop a bitcoin node and keep it active for queries except by blocking the network. There is a small script in my repo for doing that. It uses iptables to block network access. It could be adapted quite simply to check current block number and set iptables blocking rules when reached. That would enable stopping a node at a preset block
OTOH If you have a sql db of the network you can do more complex queries and don't need to stop the node as you can add a block# condition to any query you make.

I believe any BTC withdraw is going to first be the result of a trade. That is, they don't have a fixed price and guarantee you get BTC. Like MtGox it is an exchange as well so you would deposit fiat, buy BTC and then transfer those somewhere. Hence, any BTC comes from other customers selling their BTC. 
Arbitrage will fill in the gap and with IBAN and direct access to banking networks the arbitrage should keep price very close to MtGox. In fact this should enable this exchange to compete furiously with MtGox and split the market into two large exchanges instead of one.

When you login the web page code in your browser gets the encrypted wallet from the server. It decrypts it and uses the addresses locally to generate your transactions and balance. 
When you send bitcoins it uses the private key locally to sign the transaction and send only that data on to the server. The bitcoin network can verify the signature without private keys and never needs to know them.
The primary concern with using a wallet like blockchain.info is that the web page you access could be altered or intercepted by a hacker. The creator of the site offers a browser plugin that knows how to check the web page code against the master copy at github.com. 
Installing that verifier plugin gives you an extra step of ensuring that you don't get tricked into using hacked code and that under the hood things are working as intended.

[Vanitygen]( can be used without prefix to generate normal addresses. It even supports GPU use and on an old HD5830 I was able to gen about 20 Mkey/sec. Newer ones must be even faster. On a low end cpu I seem to recall more like ~50 Kkeys/sec. 
And, wow, such an old program now. No update for 6 years.

Didn't you just ask this a few days ago or was that someone else?
You record the exact block number at that time/date. Thereafter, you can sync a pruning node to that block number and have a complete image of the chainstate at that exact time which you can then query as you need. A minimal pruning node will have the UTXO (chainstate directory) plus 550 MB, in total about 3.5 GB of disk space.
To sync to a given block you would block network access when the block is reached. A simple script can achieve that by making rpc calls to check block number and adding an iptables rule to block net access. The `jq` program can be very handy for this.

In general,
- reliability varies, if going this way I'd suggest at least a round-robin failover approach.
- dependent on their servers being correct, some have had bugs in past
- loss of privacy depending on how you use eg. subscribe to addresses
- dependent on their server not being hacked and spoofing events
That all said, for non-critical uses you'd probably be fine. If you are going to write a small script to process based on a web api call then it's practically as easy to base it on bitcoind zmq interface. So as mentioned it's mostly a disk space / cpu load issue. A node doesn't use much cpu on average but it's hard to use less than a few GB even for a pruning node.
Here's an example zmq handler written in python I hacked out of my sqlchain project (which supports zmq for a sql data layer):
    def getTxsZMQ(cfg):
        try:
            import zmq
        except ImportError:
            log("Warning: Could not find pyzmq; ZMQ disabled")
            return 
        zctx = zmq.Context()
        zsck = zctx.socket(zmq.SUB)
        zsck.setsockopt(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, "rawtx")
        zsck.setsockopt(zmq.RCVTIMEO, 1000)
        zsck.setsockopt(zmq.LINGER, 0)
        zsck.connect(cfg['zmq'])
        log("Connected to ZMQ on %s." % cfg['zmq'])
        while True:
            try:
                msg = zsck.recv_multipart()
                topic,body = msg[0],msg[1]
                if topic == "rawtx":
                    # do something with the tx - filter and call web hook
            except zmq.Again:
                pass
        zctx.destroy()
        return
You could hack that a bit and run it on the pruning node to call a web hook. For security I'd suggest adding an otp library call to authenticate for the web hook.

Maybe what you were seeing was accounts. That is usually the last digit in the derivation path. You could try Electrum to restore with the seed, choose "Restore", "Standard", "I have a seed", then choose BIP39 when you see the options button, then when given the derivation path try changing the final digit from 0 to 1 or 2. Don't alter the tics ( ' ) next to digits. Each account has to be restored separately (Electrum doesn't show multi-account in one wallet) but each wallet address list should be accessible.
Also, I seem to recall in Mycelium you can restore the initial seed but if you then go to the HD wallet options you can also add new accounts there and that should allow you to add the same  and  accounts (which are entirely separate wallets). 
edit: Another way you can do this, perhaps more easily and quicker, is to save the [iancoleman]( site offline and then try the seed words and explore various account values until you see the address lists you are expecting. That only works if you know an address from each old wallet to check. That tool is also good for understanding how the various wallets and types are derived from a single seed. 
You should not type your seed words into it while connected online, or really, to be safe, same goes for any wallet while connected.

This is partly what leads many to believe Bitcoin will be more of a settlement layer with higher fees and most trxs being done on Lightning or side chains/secondary layers. But we've seen in the last years that the fee market is a lot more complex than simply miner rewards. In an ideal world the mining gets re-distributed across millions of users who aren't particularly sensitive to profiting off the mining aspect, more like how nodes are run now. Technology may move that way as cheap asic chips become commodity items.

Among the broader population certainly hardly anyone uses it. But within technically aware people who are into Bitcoin I think quite a few use it occasionally. I get paid for contract programming in Bitcoin and so I have a reason to use it for things. I've to some extent been living off it for 5 years. I first got paid for work in 2013 and much of my work since then has been paid in Bitcoin. When I see something I want I'll check if it's reasonable to buy it directly with Bitcoin. Usually it's not but sometimes it works, like for hosting or domain names. I bought a mexican burrito at Brisbane airport once but usually it's for technical items or stuff I've bought on fastech.com. I can withdraw from an ATM in Thailand for less fees and better exchange rates than if I use my US bank card.

Especially for high amounts as a "savings account". You can print out a paper wallet today with ready to use addresses. Make copies for a safety deposit box. Then later, when you feel like you're getting too much money online, you send some to the paper address(es) to tuck it away safe.
The real paranoid will use the **bitaddress.org** html file while disconnected from the net with a LiveCD so there is less chance of infection. 
Another method that doesn't require printing is to take a long text passage (perhaps from a book on your shelf) and use bitaddress to create a "brain wallet" key pair. You don't need to store the private key if you can reliably get the text passage later. Send coins to the address. Monitor the address online without loss of security.
Bitcoin is great. There are just so may ways you can do things.

You would have had to mine them at that point. And even though fairly easy with a CPU before mid-late 2010 you would still have needed to mine almost every block for the whole year to get that many BTC. So... fantasy actually.

It really comes down to your specific needs and how robust and secure it needs to be. You can use an online api like that or even several to give some redundancy and spread load. They're not bad but also not that reliable either. So if money depends on events being triggered I would shy away from being dependent on them.

The 4G link on your phone would be fine for running some miners rigs. I don't have current data rates but going off vague memory I think the mining protocol may use around 10KB/s - that's about .01 MB/s x3600 x24 x30 = 26 GB/mo. Still quite a bit to pay for (if not included) but not beyond reach. And it may be less as my memory is foggy on that.

That's right but it would help return to more decentralized mining, assuming they sell the chips to everyone and not just some select group. The energy efficiency is purely a competitive advantage for Intel. It would be a weak product if it was less efficient as they would have to sell it for a lot less to compensate (probably too cheap to be profitable). If anyone can push miner efficiency to it's limit surely Intel can. Bitcoin is best served by commodity chips much like DRAM chips so any of a thousand small companies can make miners.

If you mean the blockchain then - yes, it keeps every transaction record back to the genesis in 2009. But it has no user/id info at all. Anything like that is tracked by other monitoring, eg. vendors, nodes watching IPs, exhanges etc. The blockchain does not contain IP data at all.

Why use an inverter at all? You want to kick it up to 120/240 so that the power supply can drop it back down to 3.3/5/12V again. Just find a regulated way of going from 12/24V to the systems power. eg. there are 12V based ATX supply blocks on eBay and other sources like PicoATX etc.
Also, for mining you do not need much bandwidth. You do not need a full node. You only connect to the pool server and transfer relatively small amounts of data. So just a regular 4G mobile data plan should work, though specifically how much I'm not sure now. I used to mine years ago 2011-2014 so actual numbers are forgotten.
But I'd hazard to guess this is all wasted effort anyway as the space required to do any worthwhile amount of mining is going to exceed the trailer you're pulling. You may think you'll make some bucks off a few small hunks of miner but you will actually make pennies.

A pruned chain will still download all txs but only keep the last portion as it rolls forward. You can choose how many MB/GB to keep. Minimum is 550MB but you can set some amount like 2GB. It always keeps the UTXO set anyway and that takes ~2.5GB. So your overall minimum is about 3GB. 
Whether you prune or not depends on your needs. If you plan to have a wallet and it will be starting fresh then pruning works fine. But if you want to restore or import an old wallet or keys then you must do that before syncing (before any old txs) otherwise you will need to re-sync after. A pruned node cannot check old txs, but if starting new then it will sync your wallet fine as new txs occur.
If you need it for more general tx look ups (not just your own wallet) then you cannot use pruning and probably will need the tx index (which takes an additional ~20-30 GB as well). If being used as some external backend doing RPC calls then likewise pruning most likely not workable.

I think most newer wallets, or those that are actively developed (like Electrum) support and even have preference for segwit. I was happy when I got my trezor to see it's strongly slants towards the default being segwit and only keeps non-segwit around as a legacy wallet for compatibility. Kudos to them. 
Without even actively making effort I've already benefited from lower fees.

When you've ruled out your input errors then you have to start looking at what else is possible.
If the coins are on the same address and you don't have that address in the wallet you restore, and you are 100% sure you are giving the same input data, then the algorithm (code) it's using to generate your address has changed. Maybe a fix for a bug that was affected by your input (eg. double spaces or who knows).
This requires some technical detective work to figure out. Go to the samourai github and look thru commits until you see one that has changed the wallet/key gen code. 
If you find that then maybe talk to the devs about it because it will take some android dev skills to build the version before the commit where older code is generating the wallet.  
Anyway, this is the avenue I would start working on if I was sure I was giving it identical seed data.

Are you sure it only costs 3% using your normal method including currency exchange rates? I regularly do ATM transfers internationally and due to Visa/ATM fee increases a couple years back it started costing me more. The exchange rates seem to always be quite a bit worse than (local) market and I lose about 1.5% alone.
I don't think there is a prudent way to reduce your fees with Bitcoin at this time. But there is the potential to take advantage of price differentials (arbitrage) to time your transfers and cancel out fees.

Not exactly true. The difficulty adjusts both up and down according to the network hash rate. It has already gone down for a period of months last year until around December 2011, where interest started to pick up, pushing the price up and causing miners to start to turn on again. 
I expect the difficulty will make a big jump when ASICs start mining but it's entirely likely that it will also drop again for some periods as miners find it's not as profitable as expected. The bitcoin price is a leading indicator for mining. As price rises miners turn on as electricity remains constant. As price drops miners turn off as some aren't making money.
Here is a graph of difficulty over time.

There have been a few btc hook services out there. If you're just casually playing around this can work but as far as security it's not good at all. Anyone can trigger your webhook unless you build in some otp/token or ssl+pwd capability.
Anyway, I think it's pretty easy to do with electrum as it has hooks for various events and you can add a few lines of python code to have one trigger a webhook call. I'd have to go find a sample if that interests you. It has the advantage you can use a watch-only of a hw wallet. With a few extra lines it could do an otp/token to prevent spoofing the webhook.
For max robustness/security you'd likely best use bitcoind and it's notify/zmq events interface.
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:52:55
Definitely. You could make these even cheaper because the trezor uses a cpu that costs $15 (retail) and for the task of capturing PIN you can use a $1 cpu (depending on just how much you want to mimic). The question is how would you get the PIN out? You don't want to have to swap it again. If you used a ESP8266 as cpu it could make independent wifi connection. I guess ideally you'd want a 3g chip and there are some around. Otherwise you need something on the system to act as relay... well, perhaps you can act as HID device and somehow feed commands in thru opening a hidden terminal on system.

You can download on a fast machine and then copy the sync'd bitcoin directory over to a raspi or slow system and continue. It will have no problem keeping up. It's just that downloading and processing the initial 206GB of data takes time. I just finished on a Celeron 3930 media box and it took 8 days. On a recent fast VPS I did it took less than one day.
Better yet, just put the hard disk in a fast system and then transplant back to raspi. It's usb anyway. You don't need to buy new hw - just temp access to something fast and a good net connection.

Also the firmware isn't installed until you get it. That doesn't make it impossible to have a malicious fake but it does raise the bar as the hardware would have to behave like it's real, accept the firmware and report back correct hashs. Not impossible but a higher level of competence required than simply copying or hacking existing firmware. 
IIRC you have to confirm the hash on screen after installing firmware so they would have to pre-compute the hash in fake firmware. What I am unsure about is if each user's firmware is customized to give a different hash or if everyone confirms the same value.

You can't be sure when .cookie is created so this seems most reliable.

    while [ $? -ne 0 ]
    do
      sleep 1

Every full node has a copy of entire 206GB. Some nodes are pruning and only keep limited recent blocks (GB amount set by user), plus data for their own wallet addresses.
All nodes keep a "chainstate", which is a record of every unspent output. This is needed to verify new txs are valid.
Not sure exactly how many full nodes but thousands anyway.

You can export it as csv (commas, no quotes, addr/amnt pair per line) and then open that file in Electrum using Tools, Send To Many menu item. It will create a multi-output transaction. The total sent and fee should show and you can Preview the whole deal before sending. Copy/paste also works if you can manage to get it into comma separated pairs.
If you want to totally automate so no manual actions then you can do using the console scripting features of Electrum.

After much digging I found there is a way around this which unfortunately is not flexible enough to be useful. The -sysperms option allows using system default permissions. Except the system default is 022 and so the .cookie file is created 644 and anyone can read it. It would be so much more useful if sysperms could take a mask value to use. Then you could set sysperms=027 and get a cookie file with 640 perms (allow anyone in bitcoin group to read files but not write). So for now I seem to be stuck with the systemd service hack.
Although I have one more possible avenue. Maybe I can set the system default permissions in the service file for just this single case.
**edit** Yes. I found this last idea worked. In the service unit set the UMask=0027 value. Now when started the default system perms are 640. So just add sysperms=1 to your conf file and it works without the extra script. No. I didn't spend the last 5 hours finding this out. I did other stuff too. :)

Not if you consider electricity - and you should, considering how long you'll need to generate addresses for.
As an example only (because I'm sure someone can do better) on my old GPU (HD5830) I could do 20 Mkeys/sec. There are currently 58 million UTXOs out of ~2^160 addresses so on average (evenly spread) you would need to generate (2^160 / 58x10^6) keys to hit one, or 2.5×10^40. On my GPU that would take (2.5×10^40 / 20x10^6) seconds, or 4×10^25 years. Since my GPU uses 300W (0.3kwh) even at super cheap Chinese $0.02/kwh that is $7x10^27. Now granted you can maybe do it a million times cheaper with a custom ASIC so let's assume you made a custom keygen chip so you can find one for $7x10^21. Not counting chip dev or mfr costs and the fact you'd need to make more than you could with all the silicon on earth to find one within your lifetime (and all the power).
TLDR: You gonna spend all the money in existence to find a winning ticket this way. Big numbers are glorious.

I'm not sure of the details but this scenario has been worked on and solved by JoinMarket and similar. They create some sort of tx / contract where all have to sign for it to be valid and accepted on the network. But that's for automated cases.
Maybe it's a simple as creating a tx with inputs from each funder and then passing the unsigned tx around for signing? You can try that manually with Electrum. Also, I think coinb.in provides a manual tx creation function where you can enter address to select inputs.
I think this may work: 
- Create a watch-only "import" wallet in Electrum with the fund-from addresses of your 5 persons. That will show all the unspent outputs on those addresses in the coin tab. 
- Use the coin tab to select an output from each address to spend from and the amount. Not sure you can choose amount from each but if not then you'd want to have persons pre-fund an address with exact amount ready for this use. 
- Add the destination multisig address on the spend tab. Click the preview button and check all details. 5 inputs with amount from each person. Someone/all have to cover fee too. 
- Save the transaction to disk. Now send that transaction round-robin style to each person for signing. They would load the tx from file (menu Tools, Load tx) in their wallet (having the address they gave you), and sign, then save the new partially signed tx back to disk to. Send that file to next user.
- When all 5 have signed it should be possible to broadcast the tx funding the address.
In this scenario if any address has been spent before the tx is broadcast then it should not be accepted - making it all or nothing. 
You can verify this using Electrum on testnet before having to risk any btc. Start electrum with the --testnet option, create some test wallets, fund them from a testnet fountain.

I sync'd bitcoin on an Celeron C3930 (only 2 core). Not sure how that compares but it took 5 days. It should use more CPU than that or something is limiting it. I usually saw more like 30-50%. It does a lot of math to verify blocks and it could be on Celeron it doesn't have the oomph to do it in hardware. I'm not sure about that. On a fast VPS it sync's in 8-9 hours. Also, poor net connection can limit as it is downloading 220 GB total. That's avg. of 500KB/s for 5 days.

There are two programs you can use for cracking older type electrum wallets. btcrecover is one and JohnTheRipper is the other. Both can be run yourself without too much work. JTR is more versatile and faster but btcrecover is easier to set up and use. I wrote a [small tool myself]( but it's somewhat limited. It takes a word list + template and tries all combinations. It works too but is slower.
JTR can be done for you by someone else (even me) without giving up your seed by only giving out the first portion (some initial number of bytes can be used for cracking the pwd but not used to steal funds).
Neither of these tools works well for later wallets after Mar 2016 (v2.8.0 iirc) due to hardening of the encryption method used.
Do not give your wallet file to someone else even though you may be tempted thinking your btc are lost. Given time and a bit of effort you can recover them.

You're forgetting that the 7 BTC he gets for his goods is also **worth more** for other goods on the market. It is worth the same as when he paid 9 BTC for it. The drop in price is not the same as in an inflationary currency.
This is only a problem for those who cannot think of money in a new way. People who know the currency value is increasing will expect to sell and buy goods at lower prices, knowing full well it's because the currency is now worth more. Again you are assuming that Bitcoin would be a sole mandatory currency, and that is not true and never will be.

It is possible as long as you aren't worried about association between transactions. ie. merchant A can see that you dealt with merchant B and C etc.
In practice it's not doable with Bitcoin-Qt because it will send any "change" back to a new address in the wallet. I believe blockchain.info allows choosing the same address for change.
If you're not familiar, change is a normal part of bitcoin transactions as the txout being used as input to your recipient is usually not the exact value. So a remainder portion is sent back to you as change.
Another option is Electrum since the single wallet seed is easy to backup/manage. It is a sequence of 12 words, so it can even be written down. If you ever lose the wallet then Electrum will automatically regenerate any used addresses from the seed value. 
It's a good idea to choose to encrypt the wallet. Then you need to remember/save the password. However, with a seed you do not need the password since the wallet is regenerated from only the seed. In fact, using a seed you can restore the wallet any time you need and potentially wipe the wallet file after use (useful for public computers or LiveCD/Tor situations).

Huh? Arbitrage is the method by which markets balance themselves. We never want to get rid of arbitrageurs as they perform a function that others won't. We should me striving to encourage them as that keeps the exchanges useful. Without them people wanting to trade will all end up on one exchange like MtGox. In fact, the reason Bitcoin trading has trouble spreading out to many exchanges is because arbitrage is difficult right now. The bitcoin fees are fine but the cost of moving fiat between exchanges widens the spread between them.

Most sellers will not be receiving significant amounts of BTC anyway so in reality the hodling of a small amount of BTC is not going to matter (for now). For those that are receiving a significant percent in BTC - well, they are probably doing something BTC related and can plan for daily exchanging and even benefit from market moves.

Except it wouldn't work on ebay now since you can't leave a neg for buyers. The buyer has no incentive to release funds once product received other than being a good person. The buyer also has leverage to demand a partial refund (aka make-a-deal) in order to release funds. Given how many buyers don't bother to leave feedback I wouldn't be surprised if many didn't bother to release funds.

Your best long term bet is a BIP39 seed phrase. It's not ideal but is supported by most wallets, hardware wallets and utility tools.
The most flexible and non-vendor lock-in wallet is Electrum. Even though it doesn't create BIP39 wallets by default it can restore them and has many features other miss out. It is open source, widely used and has been around the longest (other than bitcoin-qt).
Note that BIP38 you mention is not a seed phrase but an encrypted key format and is not recommended due to implementation issues.
For a cold wallet use a BIP39 seed phrase created on an air-gapped/offline system and copy the xpub value for use as a watch-only wallet either in Electrum or other wallets (many support this use). It is better than a paper key as it avoids errors when it comes time to sweep/spend.
If you want the simplest way to securely store btc then buy a hardware wallet - cheapest right now is Trezor One (afaik) and write down the BIP39 seed safely.

If you are using Electrum why don't you just create a wallet from the BIP39 seed words? It will show you the "coins"; that is, the addresses which have unspent outputs and you would need the keys for each of those. In other words you need the private key for each address that has unspent outputs. If it's just one or two then not too hard but the more you have the easier it is to just create a wallet from seed.
BTW if using coleman site you should be sure to use offline (not while connected to net). Save the web page as file and boot on a usb stick or disconnected system and open it in a browser. Otherwise you are at risk of MITM / spoofs and possible hacked javascript code. You can also use Electrum offline in a similar way though it's a bit more involved to set up.
If you want to check your wallet in Electrum using a watch-only mode then you need the **xpub** from coleman site and create a wallet in Electrum from that. It will show all unspent outputs, addresses etc. but is not at risk of theft (though again, only use coleman site offline).

It's non-reversible. That is, you can generate prv/pub keys from a seed but not get the seed for any specific key (one way only). If you have a prvkey and a xpub (master pub key from seed) then you can calculate other keys in the chain (assuming non-hardened xprv). So it's important to not give out any prv key when xpub not kept secret.
The method for generating prv keys from seed includes hashing so that's why you cannot get back.

Here's an excerpt from the [BIP32 standard]( which describes the security model:






With a BIP32 (upon which BIP39 is based) wallet you cannot safely give out or lose a private key without compromising all other keys in the same chain (single account level, of which most wallets only use one account) if the master public key is known. Different coins are entirely different chains above the account level and not compromised when a single private key is revealed of another coin.
For best security I'd suggest not giving out a master (extended) public key for any wallet. If you need to allow someone access to generating addresses then use a dedicated account for that and don't keep large sums in it.

The pi 3 will be very slow to sync so you likely will want to sync on a faster system and then plug the hard drive into your pi when done. It can keep up with new blocks no problem. The bitcoind node software does not have miner code in it any more. It was removed years ago. In fact it may be hard to even find cpu mining software now. You can get the old version cgminer before it had cpu removed and there is no doubt still some educational projects kicking around on github though the names escape me now. 
Education is setting up the software and running it for an hour until you realize it just sits there doing next to nothing, and then shutting it off. There's really nothing to see except a few numbers on a status display. Even GPU mining is more about setting up software and drivers than any actual mining activity. I have an old block eruptor (usb dongle) sitting in it's box from years ago and have not plugged it in since 2014. Even with that you still run miner software (not bitcoin node software) and point it at some pool. It did ~300 MH/s because it had one asic chip.
Miniscule hardly describes your odds of finding a block, or even making a single cent with cpu/gpu or old asic miners. Anyway, bottom line is you need to install miner software for mining and point it at a pool not bitcoin node software.
Regarding a pruned node on SD card - should work ok. It's probably going to shorten the life of the card but no big deal as cheap anyway. The node software after sync'd does not have heavy I/O requirements.

You mean spamming the netowrk. yes, there are some protections but small valid txs are possible.

I'm looking at it that way because that is what is actually done in hardware. Even solo mining uses RPC to communicate with the mining software, which in turn controls the mining hardware. For solo mining, you act as the pool for yourself by running bitcoind, which forms the block, and then provides work on the block to the miner program, eg.cgminer. Only the process of doing work is handled by the hardware. Since we'r talking about hardware requiring change to handle large blocks, my point is that this isn't the case because it only ever does nonce work for the miner, which in turn makes getwork requests to the [pool, bitcoind] - where the block is formed.

Your country doesn't matter to any wallet you install and run yourself, whether on your PC, Android or iOS. I'd suggest the most fleible wallet for any PC / desktop use is Electrum. You download (make sure only from [official site]( and install to create your own wallet. 
If the amount you plan to store is significant then look into using Electrum offline or get a hardware wallet. Both are more secure. Do not store a large amount on a network connected system you use for other risk-prone activity (anything that could result in malware on your system).

Transactions are actually small scripts but very limited by what operators they have and by network acceptance/validity rules (for security).
Most likely when you hear that terminology someone is referring to an application that either uses blockchain technology (ideas/concepts) or interfaces with a blockchain (of which bitcoin is only one specific implementation with it's set of rules, albeit the original one). The actual bitcoin core software is coded in C++ and codifies a set of rules for transaction validity, network relaying and everything else that makes it work.

I'm not sure I'm understanding that statement. Is there an advantage to having many simultaneous graphs being worked on or is there some property that means every miner must be working on a single graph to produce a valid block?
If multiple graphs are useful then within one FPGA of 16 cores it would be working on 16 different graphs where each graph is stored in only one memory chip. I was working on that, perhaps incorrect, assumption so maybe I missed a core idea about uniqueness and parallelism in the Cuckoo cycle algorithm.

Block size would not impact mining hardware as the actual hashes the pipeline computes are not of the block but derived from the block. Solo or pool mining makes no difference either. The only value that changes in a miner pipeline is the nonce, and the raw block data never goes into the pipeline.

I don't like they use BitPay. A company like them should be able to figure out how to run their own BtcPay server and do it for the commitment it shows. 
Nonetheless, the actual reason I won't buy their product now is because I bought the original Nano and was never impressed with their support or commitment to making it functional. I often had problems with it randomly losing the seed, often not being able to sign on Electrum and pretty lousy support for Android 2FA - the only use model that was secure IMO. After that experience I just decided I wouldn't go with them again. I'm weary that when they launch a new product they'll drop support for the old one as they have already done.

Electrum can handle this fairly easily, if you don't expect much volume, without real POS. The receive tab has a list of addresses you own. You can right-click on an unused one and show the QR code full screen. User scans and pays and within a few seconds you'll see Electrum synchronize and list the payment as pending.
Also, I could see printing a bunch of "QR bills" with Bitaddress.org, importing to your client and placing the bills in the cash drawer. Then when a customer wants to pay you grab one and let him scan the QR code. Jot down the amount (and whatever else you want) and put it in the cash drawer like a bill for end of day prcoessing. Again you can see the payment pending within seconds on whichever client you use. For low value, low volume with "friendly" customers this may be enough. 
I wouldn't mind coding a bulk-bill print feature in Electrum similar to the bitaddress paper wallet. Then this kind of thing would be very easy.

Obviously it can't be many as most likely they were in the early days and 50 btc. ie. only 3 blocks plus a mish mash of low payouts.

Commodities generally have physical form and are used or consumed for some other purpose. Some commodities have been used as currency. If Bitcoin were a commodity it would have to be an imaginary one that only exists as numbers in a ledger. Most money today only exists as numbers in bank legders. I think Bitcoin is more similar to other money in that sense. It has a more robust basis for creation, security and free transfer. (Free, not as in beer)

That's correct. At any moment it's a statistical question (probability) that the data you hash may turn out valid. Specific nonce ranges and arrangement of data won't affect that since a SHA256 hash is a randomization (or very closely) of input anyway. Some miners may be hashing the same data but it's only by slim chance if they are.

Probably not on a raspi. You can try my [sqlchain]( project. It's lighter than any others I've looked at. Others like abe and insight will take a huge amount of space (3x the blockchain or more) and a lot of cpu power to process into a SQL backend. Mine is SQL based as well but at least it's more compact. Anyway, it's essential to run it on a fast SSD as it will take months to sync the blockchain into SQL otherwise. I've run sqlchain on fairly light VPS servers and it has options to help cut down on resource needs like running on top a pruned node. It can provide full indexed lookup in half the size of the blockchain in some cases (myrocks db engine and throw away witness data).

Not really in a usable way. With CLTV it is the address that is locked until a time. It would enable preventing a spend until a future date but that's not really what's needed here. You could use nLockTime to post date txs for future broadcast but that requires the funds are owned when the tx is created (and can be spent to void before the date). Quite likely people won't want or be able to tie up future payments especially given the price could change drastically. Since the exchange rate needs to be considered on the due date that really means the tx has to be created on that date.

Even very simple bitcoin transactions are going to have two addresses output. One for the actual destination and one for change back to sender. This happens because the transaction only takes past outputs as inputs and they are very rarely exactly the right amount. So it may take 0.5 as input when you expect to receive 0.1. The remaining 0.4 will get sent to a "change" address owned by the sender. Same as when you go into a store and give them a $10 bill for a $5 purchase. You get the remainder back as change.
Since you say it resolved itself and the link you provided doesn't show the 0.12 that you expected I guess that means a second transaction to another address happened later to complete the amount you were expecting. You'll probably notice on that one that it also had some change sent to another "unknown" address.

Trying to check your math. You paid 500 sat. Tx is 819 bytes. So 500/819 = 0.610 sat/byte. But miners use weight now so 500/2296 = 0.217 sat/wu. 
Did you tag it RBF? If so it will be worth raising the fee. Otherwise I expect this tx to get dropped. Since many explorers (even blockstream.info) aren't showing it, and maybe many miners have dropped it already, you could likely do a double spend with higher fee and it would get confirmed first. Many wallets make that hard but if using Electrum I think newer versions allow manually dropping it and creating a new tx.

You can easily install Bitcoin easily on many Linux distros like Ubuntu, Mint, Debian, Raspian etc. Doing it yourself reduces who you need to trust.
The problem with a dedicatedd distro is that then it has to be gone over with a fine tooth comb and continually monitored for security related changes. It becomes a specific target rather than a generalized OS used by everyone. So when you know it will be used for Bitcoin it becomes worth attacking more than one that is usually not but may possibly be used for Bitcoin. Also, resources are better spent keeping a more general OS secure for everyone.

Yes, the client can generate before sync or any time. Addresses can be generated thru many methods, even offline on paper, and never touch the blockchain. Only when a transaction occurs to an address does anything get put in the blockchain. Which is why the client needs to sync before you see the transaction.
You can see in the client what block you're sync'd to, and you can see on blockchain.info what block has your transaction. When your client catches up and "sees" that block it will show up in your wallet. The client is really just a "block verifier / viewer" app that happens to be tracking your addresses. It needs to process the block before it knows about your transaction.
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:12:25
As individual keys you can do this. But wallets like Electrum prevent you from hacking this way by encoding the xprv to have format info. The equivalent would be to use the same seed words to generate multiple wallets. I don't think you can do that with native Electrum due to type encoding but with BIP39 it's not encoded in seed words so would work. But then you can make up your derivation codes too if you like.
This isn't anything new though. You've always been able to use the public key in a p2sh redeem script, and you've always been able to derive unlimited "key/address" pairs from a private key by adding some fixed value to the key repeatedly. eg. +1,+2,+3 etc. Earliest Electrum wallets were almost this simple.

It took me a lot longer than an hour. More like a half day - but I didn't time it carefully. And this is with the bootstrap which I downloaded first. This was on a server with excellent connectivity in Chicago.
I don't understand why we need a bootstrap that has to be processed anyway. Why not create an archive of the blockchain and sign it for security and then have the client check signature and accept it. That would save the most time and network load.

Why would you hold btc for 12+ hours? When you deposit to bitstamp I'm sure you deposit Euros. You only hold BTC for a few minutes between when you buy on one exchange, send to the other, and sell again. I don't know how many confirmations cavirtex needs but it's likely only 6 or so - meaning about 1 hour plus some time to enter trades.
If you watch the exchanges then you can potentially trade when a price imbalance negates the fees. ie. euros get more btc than cad cost when sold.

More details. What version was original, what version is new one? What type of wallet was original - standard, segwit, non-segwit, multisig? These are all options that affect what wallet you end up creating. The first thing to check is if the addresses in new wallet are the same as in old wallet. If not then you have made some mistake in options or words entered. If the same, then your new wallet has not sync'd properly.
If you are using a pre 3.x version then stop now and upgrade. Old versions will likely not sync properly. 
Finally, if the wallet was originally created in non-Electrum software then it's likely a BIP39 wallet and that option must be selected during restore steps.

It's not so easy as the key generation uses PBKDF2 hardening. It's certainly not impossible but it is much slower than just guessing hashes. So a decent passphrase is needed but not necessarily a long random one as would be the case if not hardened.
@_date: 2018-11-26 04:55:23
You should probably read up on general hardening of servers. eg. remove unnecessary services. You do not need to have the port open for running a node and if I had a wallet there I probably would keep it tight as possible. 
For your own access you can tunnel in via ssh quite easily and that is more secure than leaving it open. Set ssh to use key login only, disable root and pwd access. Change ssh port to high range. 
I would only keep small amounts on any network connected node and especially on a VPS. Remember that even though you have root control anyone working in the datacenter or admins for the host company can also get root. 
Transfer to your nano when the wallet balance gets higher than you want to risk or look into using a xpub to make it watch only (no seed or keys on server). 
The server environment is inherently unsafe and preferably any outgoing payments should be done through a system you have total control over and very limited or no public connection. Some exchanges have been hacked presumably via root access on vps servers (or so they claimed, it may have been an exit scam; who knows).
edit - just noticed you said Ubuntu VM - that doesn't protect you at all. Anyone gaining root on your system will have full access to the VM and some malware has been reported to be smart enough to access VM disk images.

It varies. Roughly from around 100 bytes up to any amount limited by block size. Most are in the 100-300 byte size. It depends on input and output count. A typical tx has a few inputs and maybe 2 outputs, but of course depends on what the user is doing. Some may have hundreds of either or both.

@_date: 2018-11-30 04:24:52
That's a fairly big topic for here but there are some tutorials around that help. In general it comes down to removing unneeded services (things installed by default but not necessary), using keys for ssh login instead of pwds (disable pwd auth), moving ports to unusual numbers for obfuscation (not really security but cuts down on noise, which helps with log auditing), running various daemons or tasks with dedicated user ids that don't have login privileges, and maybe some steps specific to btcpay which I haven't looked into yet. You can install various monitoring and detection tools but they require some experience in using properly and keeping them effective. Your best approach is to make it so very little damage can be done if compromise occurs, eg. not having keys on servers, not allowing admin users on servers to have access to other servers or admin systems (they don't have keys for connection out to other systems). Better to get a more thorough tutorial and there are some out there findable via google.

From their description it sounds like it's all web interface for management. That would mean you plug it in, connect it to your router and then use your browser to do any management just you likely do with your router or some printers. I'd guess for a low level admin purpose you may be able to ssh into it as well. Even though it may be possible (?) to hook up a monitor and keyboard it sounds like that's not your normal admin mode.
It says it is pre-sync'd with the blockchain so that means you can plug it in and get it running fairly quickly. You won't have to wait a week for the blockchain to download as you would on most lower speed systems.

 - not sure why this would be useful. Many people are going to create addresses just for this purpose. And there's no way to check a creation date if the address wasn't previously used for a transaction. If the idea was to try and prevent someone flooding with many addresses (cheating) then a better idea would be to associate address with reddit name. At least then they would need to create a reddit name for each attempt. Sadly there's always some one who will try to abuse generosity.

Private keys are generated mathematically from your seed. So yes, you are right that your wallet has a link but it's one based in math not in looking up data online. 
Your wallet generates a huge random number, and encodes that as a seed word list for your convenience. It only needs it as a number, which it uses to generate private keys. From each private key your wallet calculates an address, which it provides to you (either one at a time or in a list). It can generate as many unique key/address pairs as you'll ever need.
You can spend BTC because you can sign a transaction proving ownership of the private key for the address of the coins being spent. Anyone can spend BTC if they have the correct private key. As long as you have the seed words you can always generate the private keys  and addresses for your wallet. Keep your seed words very safe.
Actual BTC only exist as transaction outputs recorded in the blockchain. Your wallet queries the blockchain with your addresses to gain a full accounting of past history. From that it knows what outputs are unspent and hence you can still spend. Adding those up is your wallet balance. A spend is actually a mathematical signing operation that requires the private key. Hardware wallets keep the private keys secure by keeping the seed value safe inside it's flash memory and by being able to generate keys as needed. 
Lose the seed, you lose the keys, you lose the ability to sign txs and spend.

In essence it's just connection wiring. In a GPU/CPU the memory is wired so that multiple chips share the same address bus for a given data width, usually 64 bits. So multiple chips are tasked with accessing one address for the entire data width. 
In an FPGA design you can directly wire one address bus per chip so that one address is used for smallest possible data width, 4 or 8 bits. Each chip still has the same latency - cannot change that. And each core has to keep accessing in graph sequence. But multiple cores can access multiple chips by sharing the address lines in time slices because each chip latches it's address independently of other chips, rather than simultaneously with other chips. So 4 chips can be on differing addresses for differing graphs instead of being on one address together for one graph.

There are a few types of UTXOs, eg. P2PKH (public key hash) and P2SH (script hash). All show up as addresses (either 1... or 3... or bc1...). That is all you have for reference as "owner". 
To check if some person is the owner they would have to sign a message with their key(s) and you can verify that message with the given address (using software like Bitcoin-qt, Electrum, hw wallet, or online tool). If the message verifies then it proves they have control of the key(s) that can spend from that address, ie. use the UTXO in a new tx.

Running a node is the only way to truly verify your own BTC txs; otherwise you are depending on someone else to tell you. Depending on someone else means when an attack occurs they are deciding for you what a real BTC is. When you run a node you are using the consensus rules as coded in the core client.
As for mining and electricity I've read that China is in the 2c/kwh range or maybe free with the right hand shakes. Mining has only really worked out for those who hodl their btc til they gain in value, and if doing that then you may as well buy them and skip the hassle and risks (the revenue is always uncertain).

DDR3 RAM chips are available in typically 4,8, or 16 bit widths. Several are usually placed on a DIMM module to provide the 64 bit width used on most systems. In my case I am using individual chip connections rather than typically wider DIMM unit connection. From my reading of the data sheets, and timing diagrams, the non-sequential (address not previous+1), page-miss (not in same internal bank) latency is usually around 11-16 cycles depending on chip speed grade and generation. DDR4 has higher clock rate, but requires more cycles, offering comparable latency. The same basic principle applies for GDDR5 but often they have 32 bit width access and maybe some different internal bank setup allowing more than one access. 
DDR RAM only achieves rated bandwidth when doing sequential (burst) accesses of 4 or 8 addresses. When only a single address is requested and then the next one is in a different internal bank then it has to reset, lose the pre-fetch advantage. This is the case for most accesses in Cuckoo  and why latency is more important than bandwidth. 
To offset this in my design I use several chips sharing the same bus connection to the fpga. Several cores (4  or perhaps 8) share the bus to several RAM chips, but one core is only accessing one RAM chip at any instant. 
I'm a bit confused now about Cuckoo cycle access size (data width) and need to spend more time on the details. I thought I read in the white paper it was quite small - even 2 bits per edge. I thought this allowed using a small bit-width chip like 8 bits (the bottom 2 address bits would select position within 8 bit data width). The smaller width is an advantage as it means less DDR chips (ideally only 1) to compose a single graph "table", and means that more parallel connections to chips can be supported for a given fpga pin count. I expect that 4, 5, or 6 8-bit wide buses per fpga would fit in a low-cost 256 pin BGA package. Most of the pins are address lines. The (bus count x chips per bus) determines the overal parallel accesses achieved per latency period by time slicing between multiple DDR chips. This is not how DDR is typically used on DIMM modules or even on GPU memory (though I'm making some assumption on GPUs because I have not studied them closely).
Most of this detail came from studying data sheets last year when asked by a client to design an FPGA for Ethereum mining. I may be confusing some details now as it's not fresh in my mind any more. In the end the best design I could muster did not exceed GPU performance by enough to warrant continuing design and prototyping boards. Mostly that is because Ethereum has both a high processing and high memory latency bound algorithm. Cuckoo is much simpler but still latency bound which should make the processing core a smaller part of the overall cost.
I probably need to spend more time looking at the existing C code to see what it actually does for each cuckoo cycle access and whether that fits well with a reduced data width memory connection. If it demands a full 64 bit width access then that prevents many parallel memory connections on a single FPGA because of pin count and so limits latency "time slicing", or maybe a better term "multi-core piplineing".

Yes. But if it is a significant sum you'd hate to lose due to malware or hacked system then I'd suggest making an offline Electrum wallet as one step better. It takes a few minutes longer and is essentially the same but on a more secure system. The simplest approach is to create a bootable USB stick with linux eg. Ubuntu, Mint, Debian or Tails. Then install Electrum on that and only ever boot on it after installing when disconnected from the net. By being disconnected it's nearly as effective as a hardware wallet, though a bit less convenient. Any malware that may get on will have a hard time ever spending when it cannot connect to the net. In the ultimate version of this you take the Master Public Key (xpub) and copy it back to your online system to restore as a watch-only wallet that cannot spend but can view txs and create new addresses for receiving more btc. Anyway, without going too deep read up on "Electrum offline wallets".
Be sure you download only from the genuine electrum.org site using https.

Just wanted to mention for readers that making a bootable linux usb stick is very easy. Install electrum and have a self contained OS platform for working with bitcoin. Easy and close to free. Not perfectly secure by any means but a huge step above using Bitcoin on your Windows desktop if you also use it for other activities or share with others. 
You disconnect network, reboot onto your usb stick, do your transaction and reboot again onto your normal desktop. Again, there are still some remotely possible attack vectors but they are dwarfed by the attack possible on your general purpose desktop.

If you could generate a billion keys per second on each of a billion cpus then you would still take 20,000,000,000,000,000,000 years to have a 50% chance of collision with another user. Or to put it in lottery odds (1 in a million) it would take 40,000,000,000,000,000 years.

You need to restore a BIP39 seed phrase to do that. It's not supported for native Electrum seeds. So that means either you need to create the seed in another wallet like Mycelium or use a tool like Ian Colemans BIP39 site (but offline, of course). There is no way to create a P2SH-P2WPKH wallet natively in Electrum, and no way that I know of to create a multisig P2SH-P2WSH native wallet (but it does support native P2WSH multisig, bech32 addresses).

In general wallets use their own method for selecting inputs for a tx. Most good wallets will not spend dust if the fee for the input byte size is more than the input amount. Some simply have a lower bound on usable input amount and probably there are some that don't care and just use any inputs. I think most prefer lower number of inputs so if there are large utxos available it would use them before smaller ones - hence, you may not notice dust anyway until trying to spend all utxos. A smart wallet will not add them to total in that case as they actually cost you more to spend than worth.

Can you use it without battery if not using bluetooth? Otherwise why need it. I'd be suspicious of the bluetooth paring randomly (or on purpose) with devices while walking around. Or even worse I'd worry that it has wifi as part of bluetooth circuit and can actually connect and send data when in range of a public hotspot. 
The entire benefit  of bluetooth is not needing a small cable and that just seems like a poor tradeoff for the possible attack space opened. I even prefer the uSD card approach of coldcard over this.

I only know about doing this with Electrum. It creates a wallet file for each signor which contains all the xpubs and only the xprv for that signor. When using the wallet for any signor it's easy to view the xpub for any of the others but also view each as a QR code and save that to file. I'd think that printing a QR code of all xpubs and having them as paper copies with hand written seeds would be a good choice since it's quick and easy to scan a QR code without typo errors. Electrum can scan QR codes directly for xpubs/xprvs or seeds.
If you aren't interested in Electrum then I think you can still use the same idea with simple QR code tools for printing data.
As far as I know you only need the xpubs for managing a watch-only wallet, ie. viewing txs, generating new addresses. For tx signing I think having the xprv / seed is enough, but I think I'd test out that principle before relying on it. 
IMO Electrum provides some good support for secure multisig offline wallets that don't depend heavily on Electrum and it'd be worth exploring that when deciding on a solution even if it's not the final choice.
I used it with my Ledger Nano as one signor of a "2 of 3 multisig" wallet. So for that it did create a BIP39 wallet as that is what the Nano supports.

They're different on that explorer because it's owned by a company that has continually worked to prevent segwit from succeeding and for people to instead use "bitcoin cash". Just because the explorer "doesn't parse" (ie. have code to support) the segwit addresses doesn't mean they different in any way except technical details. They are still input/outputs the same as any legacy ones. If you need to know technical details of how they work I'd suggest [this document]( which summarizes several BIPs.

I'm not sure about that problem. It's been a long time since I did my own setup and some things seem to be different anyway. For example, I never set up the ssh settings for maintenance as I go direct thru ssh myself to my server when I want to do stuff. But I think if you set up ssh settings using your domain name then it won't be able to connect to ssh on your server unless you also forward the port for that on your router. By default ssh uses port 22. If it doesn't get forwarded from router to actual ssh server then using the domain name won't work. But if the ssh is being accessed locally by btcpay then the domain name would be incorrect there. You'd want to either give the local ip address (eg. 192.168.0.2) or even "localhost" so it can connect.
Regarding "self signed cert" - how did you create a certificate for your server? The best way now is to use certbot and  letsencrypt but that will need a bit of reading and setup (including a bit of cmd line work probably unless btcpay now automates that). If you create your own cert then that's called "self-signed", and with most browsers you would need to add an ssl exception for your page. It's ok to do that, but it won't be acceptable for general public use like when someone wants to check out. Also, if a dummy cert is installed by btcpay setup then you need to make your own, or hackers can forge your site using the dummy one. For real checkout use you need to get a real ssl cert and the easy/cheap way is using "letsencrypt". There are tutorials around and useful help on their site.
If you can't access the page in your browser via your domain name then it seems either forwarding isn't working or you aren't using correct protocol. eg. you are using http:// (port 80) when you need https:// (port 443). If you forward port 433 on your router then you must use https. Getting a 404 probably means the wrong port is being accessed or it's not properly forwarded to actual server.
Hmm. That's about all that comes to mind for info provided.

Or use the BIP38 key as stealth seed. That is, put some small amount on that key, visible on address, but derive more keys using that key as seed. You can do that in your own custom way such that no one can check if it's a seed, and spread btc across several addresses. Generating from seed is easy - many ways without even a special wallet, but you do need to remember how you do it. eg. hash N, N+1... times.

Suggest 2 of 3 signors but it actually depends on your situation. If 2 of 3, for example, then you need to store safely the seed for all 3 signors but not in the same location or on same system obviously. Your security relies on someone not easily getting 2 of 3 of the seeds.
One seed could be on a hw wallet - they are not mutually exclusive but the main advantage of a hw wallet is the ease of signing compared to a proper offline system.
When you create each signing wallet you will use one seed and two xpubs. You don't use all 3 seeds because you don't want to have them all in one location at any time. The seed will be used to create an xpub and along with the other 2 xpubs that is what is needed to create an address list by the wallet. Repeat that on two other systems each with it's seed plus the other 2 xpubs. That way each wallet only ever has one seed present.
You have 3 wallets each with one seed. Each of those wallets can partially sign a tx. After signing you take the tx to another wallet for a second and final signing. With 2 of 3 that is enough. The third wallet is generally a backup/failsafe in case one of your main wallets have issues - get lost/corrupted or whatever. This is when you are the only person involved - if more than one person then each person can have a seed plus xpubs from all other persons wallets.
As long as you have at least 2 seeds of the 3 then you will be able to sign. But to restore a wallet from scratch you will need 3 items - a full combination of all 3 seeds or xpubs. So usually it's recommended you backup the actual wallet files as that is easier then separately storing seeds and xpubs. Each wallet file has 1 seed and 2 xpubs. A seed is necessary for signing but having all xpubs is necessary for generating addresses.
Don't bother trying to store redeem scripts or public keys, and don't bother with single key/address paper wallets. Use BIP39 seed words and a proper wallet - either offline or hw wallet.

You can do this very easily with Electrum. Create an "Import wallet". Add any addresses you want to monitor and label them with whatever note to remind you. Any txs will show up in history and you can label those too.
btw if you code this using an online api like blockstream.info then it's not confidential. They will know which addresses you look up, just like any Electrum server would. You can use electrs (not EPS) and your own node with Electrum but with an online api the only way to code this and keep privacy is to get each new block as it is mined and parse that for txs in your list. That's ok if you keep connected but more of a problem if you want to back check txs when a new address is added. Running your own node (with txindex) is the only sure way to have privacy.

On your last point regarding threading - for an FPGA design, at least as I would approach it, there is no threading or even process mgmt. Just dedicated cores (the code is hard wired into the core logic) that access DDR memory. There could be more than one core doing dedicated tasks. One supervisor may be handling net communication and monitoring the cuckoo/siphash cores. The equivalent of threading would be to count how many cores are synthesized in the FPGA that each have their own memory access. 
Something I'm unclear about is on a GPU, like the GTX 980 (4GB, $400) apparently having 4x Core i7 speed, how many threads are running and are they able to independently access memory or do they have to share a single bus to memory? On an i7 threads share access except to the extent that each i7 core has local cache memory. I would have thought the GPU could achieve much higher performance (with so many cores) but for having a memory access bottleneck.

It starts slowing down around block 250k and by 400k it will be much slower. It's the tx count that matters, not the block count. Use the cli cmd `getblockchaininfo` and look at the "verificationprogress" value. That tells you how far you actually are and it's fairly accurate.

Well, you could create a coin where the difficulty is tied directly to average price over X number of blocks. I'm pretty sure you'd get some wonky / nasty behaviour out of that but who knows. Maybe it could stabilize. Build in a fixed target price and production scales up/cuts back according to price, which should be tied to demand.  
Price too high, difficulty drops, production increases, price drops, difficulty increases, production drops, supply dwindles, price increases. I bet that would oscillate like the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.

You can try using Electrum Android wallet and restoring the BIP39 seed. I don't recall off hand that it supports BIP39 but I think it does. You would need to manually check a BIP39 box option or something. Once you restore on that device you can consider the wallet no longer a hw wallet but a "mobile wallet" only as safe as your device.
Make sure you get the correct electrum from the play store. I'm willing to bet there are fakes with similar names but I haven't gone looking. 
And btw it's pretty slow and clunky and much more limited than the desktop version. If you can get to a desktop and make a bootable linux usb stick then I'd recommend doing that and using electrum offline. That's a lot closer to keeping some semblance of security in your hw wallet - though if in this situation I'd probably move my btc to a new seed when I got home.
(edit - some info removed as too complicated to use)
Now that I think of it I'd suggest going with Mycelium on Android. It's definitely BIP39 capable and should have no problem restoring your seed. Same security caveat applies.

Read up on using Electrum "offline" - in summary: 
- create an offline linux system, either with old hardware or usb boot stick.
- download and verify the AppImage from electrum.org (to verify follow steps given on download page), copy to usb stick. 
- Boot on offline system and drag the AppImage from usb stick to desktop. Right click, properties and change permissions to allow executing.
- Run it to create a new wallet. Write down the seed words and store safely. 
- Select menu Wallet, Info and copy/paste to save xpub value to your usb stick (via text editor).
- Take that usb stick back to normal desktop and use Electrum to create a "watch-only" wallet. Same general process but choose "I have a public key" instead of "Create a new seed". Copy/paste in the xpub during restore.
- check/verify the first few addresses match the ones in your offline wallet.
That watch only wallet is safe to use online for creating addresses and monitoring txs. You can create a tx there and export to usb stick for signing on your offline system. Read up on "offline signing" in the Electrum docs. 
There are many tutorials around but be selective as many are also out of date or have dubious info. So if unclear about best use then ask here.
You could also do this in a VMWare container but it would be somewhat less secure. For low value or testing it's likely fine but I'd hesitate to store a fortune that way.
If all this seems like a massive headache then buy a hw wallet. Saving time and mistakes may be worth the relatively low cost. I like the Trezor One and it works with Electrum in much the same manner as a "watch-only" wallet but without all the extra steps.
@_date: 2019-09-22 09:09:19
If you go the route of simply using a wallet on a phone then have one real wallet under your control, and any employees use a "watch-only" wallet that allows them to accept btc but not spend it. To make a "watch-only" wallet you create it with the xpub instead of seed. Not all wallets support that but some do eg. Mycelium and Electrum.
@_date: 2019-09-01 23:04:07
Depends on wallet type. Newer Electrum is pretty much hopeless to crack due to hardening, but older ones were doable with both JTR and Hashcat. You can run hashcat on a [4xGPU rig and do 1 Gkeys/sec.]( If you want to know how a hacker would go about this then read up the docs for hashcat (or JTR). It's configurable. Anyway, on newer versions (&gt;=2.8.0) there is no electrum module, afaik. There is modules for other known wallet software.

To summarize - the exact timestamp doesn't matter. It can vary by an hour or two and still be valid. That variance over the period of 2016 blocks (~2 weeks) makes minimal difference to how the difficulty is altered. Difficulty is also limited as to how much it can change. I think the max is 4x but perhaps that's been changed.

More advanced wallets allow you to flag a tx fee as replaceable (RBF). If you enable that option then if it seems to be stuck you can later bump the fee up to help it get confirmed. 
@_date: 2019-09-19 22:01:15
There is no database - only your seed. Electrum will work but when restoring the seed you need to [click the option button]( and select BIP39. If segwit you also need to ensure correct derivation path is set when it shows that. Electrum does work fine with Trezor as I use it every day but by default it restores it's own seed format (12 word only) so you need to select correct option. Also, be sure if you have a passphrase on seed you enter that or will get wrong wallet.
**edit** - note, I see the BIP39 option was only merged on Aug 13 for Android version. That probably means it's not yet in the released version as there has been no update since then. Which means you'd have to build yourself or have someone build for you. 
I'd suggest just using [Mycelium]( in the app store as that works natively with BIP39 (and they even have built in Trezor on Android support if you have the OTG cable).

Fuck Bitpay. They have no reason for existence any more. They should close up.
They used to accept btc for merchants and it was the merchants who converted it to fiat and so it was the merchants responsible for KYC on their btc.
Now they have changed roles. They are basically just an exchange and it is the buyer who is converting btc to fiat, doing KYC on their btc, and then fiat being paid to merchants. That is full reversal of business model and people are better off using an exchange where they have some control over exchange rate and fees.

That GINI index is interesting but I don't see the difference between these two countries you're saying. In the time I was in Thailand 2002-2018 it dropped ~6 pts. I noticed it was getting better, certainly for Thai's I knew personally, but it wasn't massive. Not like they were now living HiSo. And in Portugal it's now only ~1 pt off from Thailand. So that's pretty much the same given I've personally witnessed 6 pts change. 
It gets even more bizarre when looking at Australia (35.8 in 2014), or USA (41.5 in 2016) - two places I've lived. The gap in USA is worse than Thailand and that simply doesn't correspond with my experience.

of the address space.
Also, there are compressed and uncompressed keys. And though that doesn't affect the number of keys, it does mean there are two addresses possible for each key. Normally you would only use one of them but if you were brute forcing keys you might compute both addresses and gain a small speed advantage.

While that is true, and I myself have many addresses in multiple wallets, there are also many exchange user accounts without any wallet/address in that count. I'd even guess over 50% but I'm not aware of any large exchange saying how many users own but never withdraw. Even a rough figuring of the balance between these two ways of holding btc is hard to reckon. But, oh well, 42 million is a number as good as any other - Douglas Adams would be happy.

Trezor does multisig with Electrum. I've always used that instead of the Trezor software because of privacy anyway (using EPS). And when I say Trezor I think actually all hw wallets with Electrum support can do that, and even cross brand multisig, eg. 1 trezor, 1 nano etc.

Not really. It has to be running when you want to access it. It can be stopped and as soon as it starts it will catch up. If it's not down for a long time the catch up is within a minute or so - depends. I have a pruned node on my laptop that connects to my main file server system (up 24/7) and when I close it over night it generally catches up in the morning within 10-20 seconds.
**edit** - If you want your own API (insight or blockchain.info compatible) layer over top a full node then have a look at my [sqlchain project]( (open source), written in python. You can run that on a node and it will sync the blockchain into mysql and provide an API you can use via ajax/javascript easily to query. It has support for custom APIs, extending existing calls and altcoins. It can actually use less space than the blockchain depending on db engine (eg. myrocks) and option to drop signature/witness data. The down side is you need a fast SSD to sync to mysql in any reasonable time. The index updating is murder. It can work on top a pruned node and keep full data, and also has a mode for just keeping recent block data for applications that only need info as it happens and not historic - which means not having to sync all data to mysql (fast start up). I use it for some client web apps I've coded over the years and has been reliable.

I had to buy from a site using that and it worked well enough. I read a bit on it seems they don't charge a fee and the btc goes directly into the vendor's own wallet. So they seem to be just acting as an address generator and presentation link. It didn't hide the address or I would have had trouble using an offline wallet. IMO it's a step up from Bitpay and if you can't host your own BTCPay node then a decent compromise. Not that I care much for Coinbase (or even use them) but well, it's an imperfect world.
@_date: 2015-04-20 23:20:14
The problem is:
**wallets != users**
**addresses != users**
And it goes both ways - one address is often associated with many users when that address is cold storage at an exchange/web wallet, and many addresses are often associated with one user.
So even getting upper / lower bounds is difficult and you're pretty much left with making up numbers based on what you think an average user might be.

I've used it briefly just to test how it works. But I usually use one on my normal desktop. 
As for verifying I'm not sure there is an easier way for checking an already installed image of files but I think you could use git to compare against the github version. It would require installing git first, which is easy enough.
Maybe easier would be to download the Electrum tar file and extract it into a temp directory. The run diff between the two. It's probably not so straight forward as when installed the files get moved into various places unlike in the archive. Maybe it's enough to diff the primary directory with code files. 
Something like this eg.
    wget 
    tar -xzvf Electrum-2.0.4.tar.gz
    cd Electrum-2.0.4
    diff -q . /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Electrum-2.04-py2.7.egg
    diff -q electrum /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Electrum-2.04-py2.7.egg/EGG_INFO/scripts/electrum
where you change 2.04 to whatever version is current on Tails.
Basically **diff** will compare two files or dirs and list differences.

Someone buying btc at Coinbase and keeping it in their account is not even using the blockchain. They have an IOU from Coinbase that they'll get BTC if they ever withdraw.

A record or CNAME shouldn't matter as long as name resolves to correct IP. You can test that with `dig` or other lookup tool. 
If your server is located behind your router (ie. not directly connected to ISP service) then you need to add a port forward rule on your router so that the open port on the ISP facing router will forward all connections to the specific server (within LAN), which should already have an open port. You can test the correct ports are open and listening with `netstat -lntp`. But if your router doesn't forward then the connection never makes it thru to your server.
Finally, if you are on typical ADSL/home service you may have a dynamic IP. If so, then you also need to run something to update the IP when it changes, dyndns, ddns or whatever. Many choices. If your ISP gives you a static IP then it won't change and no dyndns needed.
I don't think you need to forward more than just 443 for your router (assuming SSL, which is critical except for a test).
I have mine setup similarly but to avoid having an open forwarded port I use a reverse tunnel to my existing public server. A bit different setup but allows me to have the node and sensitive data on my home server instead of hosted.

As a full node you are connected with other nodes as peer. They know your IP or else they can't communicate with you. When you send a tx it does not contain your IP as part of the tx data but the nodes you connect to must know the IP (TCP packets have it). They don't relay the IP - it's not in the tx data, but they could easily log it and if the node you connect to is intent on tracking they may assume you originated the tx (even if you didn't). This is the "first seen" assumption. Someone could connect to a huge number of nodes hoping to log these "first seen" events. So your IP is included as connection info but not "broadcast" to the network at large. That is, once the tx is relayed beyond your connection it no longer has your IP and nodes may assume it originated from your peer or that peer's peer.
Any time your computer communicates using TCP assume the other end knows your IP - it's part of the protocol for bidirectional data exchange or else they cannot ACK your packets. This goes for web pages (HTTP runs on top TCP). The only time this isn't true is when packet spoofing is done (packets have wrong origin IP value) eg. as part of DOS attacks, but then data cannot be returned to you.
There is a list of nodes suspected as acting as spys and which connect to an abnormally high number of peers. Some people add these to their node ban list to increase the odds they are not sharing IP info with spies. IIRC this list was maintained, or maybe just posted, by nullc.

And I wouldn't say "never" on btcpay. I don't know that they currently have a sweep feature but certainly it can be done separately and may be integrated - sweep btc to an exchange account at Coinbase or wherever at any interval or after a sale. That would not be a hard bit of code to add and it can be done with a simple script even now external to Btcpay server - though better done not on a website facing server.

Sounds like you're lucky you didn't open your Electrum wallet while the keyboard was being logged. I don't think you can advocate for Electrum+pwd being safe enough for larger amounts. The key logger problem is the main reason for offline wallets. But Electrum does have you covered if you use it with offline wallet for signing (MPK for online viewing), and since you seem to be stepping up your security now I'd suggest moving any significant balance to that model. A raspberry pi (or clone) makes a nice cheap offline signing wallet. Even free if you already use it as media center anyway (just swap boot sd card for signing).

I have a tool for this. Just wrote it last couple days. Called pwp - paper wallet printer. It's a command line python program. It supports output on printer and to pdf file. It has numerous options and supports multiple copies per key, and uses an svg file as template for layout and background graphics etc. (examples provided, can make small cards or other odd sizes easily)
I wasn't going to push it to my github until I did more testing but I guess if you wanted to use it I could speed that up.
It also can work from a seed to create a large batch that can be reclaimed if not used. That is, you can monitor addresses in Electrum and see which are still holding a balance or not. In theory you could sweep any or all at any time.
It also supports BIP38. Anyway, it's part of my soon to be released btcToolbox set (open source).
Here is an example cmd for 100 random wallets printed 2 copies per page:
for i in {1..100}; do od -An -N32 -xw32 /dev/random | keyfmt "%w,%a" | pwp -f test$i.pdf -c 2 BlueNote 1mBTC ; done
[sample output](
And the same generated from a seed but only 1 copy this time (since you can watch them in Electrum), this time direct to printer.

On the send tab where you enter the address there is a little qr code icon at the far right. Click that and it will turn on the web cam. If that icon isn't there then probably it needs a python module installed. I'm not sure if it's installed by default or not nowadays. I think it is "python-zbar" that is needed.

If you sent the tx then you should see a tx id in the history list. That can be looked up on an explorer (post it here if not worried about tx privacy), and see the actual fee paid. If you paid less than about 10 sat/byte currently it is likely just queued and will go thru. If you paid more then it may need some investigation but I'd bet it's just a low fee backlog.
Also, I'd be sure you have the latest version (but it should get updated automatically by play store). If you can't actually send it due to server issues then that's another story. I'm not sure what, or if any, server issues are going on right now.

Good if you like Puppies.
Two things: why use Puppy instead of Debian/Ubuntu/Mint? And, if you install from the tar archive from official site then you don't actually need to install dependencies. It can run standalone because of packages folder included. You may still need any hw wallet or unusual support packages. This allows creating a boot usb stick without even having net access at all for offline wallets (assuming you have the tar archive handy on a usb stick).

It would be very interesting if you could find math which ties stock-to-flow to the power law prices. Your price model seems to say what is happening but not why, and perhaps stock-to-flow provides the why: scarcity. But something more than just that idea, some actual reasonable math that ties these together would be encouraging. Or even perhaps some longer history of power-law to sf ratio in other monetary commodities that might show that bitcoin price behaviour is something more than a temporary curve fit.

Fuck Bitpay. They have no reason for existence any more. They should close up.
They used to accept btc for merchants and it was the merchants who converted it to fiat and so it was the merchants responsible for KYC on their btc.
Now they have changed roles. They are basically just an exchange and it is the buyer who is converting btc to fiat, doing KYC on their btc, and then fiat being paid to merchants. That is full reversal of business model and people are better off using an exchange where they have some control over exchange rate and fees.

When you view in Electrum you will only see the tx history for addresses up to the "gap limit" (default is 30). BTC received on addresses beyond that will not show even if they exist. To add more addresses to your wallet you have to increase the gap limit. You can do this in the console tab of Electrum. If you used address 228 then I'd suggest adding at least 210 more addresses like this (paste in, hit enter):
`[wallet.create_new_address(False) for i in range(210)]`
(that is a python loop that repeatedly creates new addresses - it may take a minute or few to run)
Another way is to change the gap limit either on console or by editing wallet file. That's a bit more technical though. Apparently the gap limit is max 200 so beyond that may need code changes.

But I think this Blockchain meme is probably really all about branding. They don't really like the Bitcoin "brand" and so by using "Blockchain" they avoid the association with dark markets and nefarious uses, and it allows them to market their own brand rather than be a "me too" riding on Bitcoin. Maybe they even entertain ideas about offering their own private blockchain - for those with little technical knowledge, and weak philosophy (meaning almost everyone), that may actually sound attractive. Soon we'll hear, "Welcome to the new Western Union, now using Blockchain technology".

I've had very little communication from people who may be using it. I know there's some stars and forks on github but rarely does anyone contact me. I know one guy created a [site with graphs]( using it as backend for data. I see part of his site is [open src on github]( - maybe that help you. He contributed a small fix as well. 
I think best case on a fast machine with SSD (eg. dedicated server [like this]( took over a week to process and that was a couple years ago, so would take more time now, or if slower system. Anyway, pm me if you have questions or run into issues. Also, I did discuss some things on my [blog]( (old).
The current api layers included mimic blockchain.info and insight. It's probably not hard to copy and alter the insight one to mimic blockcypher instead as a new api module. That would allow switching between the two easily or using blockcypher as backup if your node goes down or needs maintenance.

Use 2 as multisig signors and keep the third as spare. Or do 2 of 3 multisig - probably a safer use of resources. Obviously don't keep them together in the same location.
Use one or more passphrases to create a decoy default wallet and put the main btc in the passphrased one(s). Splitting btc across two devices is silly when passphrases can accomplish the same thing and multisig gives you redundancy.
If you use decent passphrases then your seeds being found is not critical. You would want to move btc before any brute forcing could be effective. Having multiple signors (seeds) makes finding 2 of them more difficult.

I thought bitaddress had it on their Wallet Details tab but I see now it only allows decypting. Odd - since the code for doing it is in there (it could be added with a couple lines of code to expose on details tab). Sorry about my mistake yesterday.
I've done some work with BIP38 coding previously and have a python utility on my github that will do what you need. You can even use it directly with output from vanitygen. I didn't mention this before because I thought bitaddress would be more acceptable due to trust. But my code is short and could be audited within minutes so you may want to check it out. I have also extended this in my btcToolbox project which I'll be posting soonish. It has more capabilities, like generating BIP38 keys from seed and a command line paper wallet printer that also works with this.
Anyway, see my utility below - and example command for encrypting directly from vanitygen output (ie. no trace of original key on disk).
vanitygen -q 1 | sed -n 's/Privkey: \\(5.*\\)/\1/p' | keyfmt '%e,%a' test123
(using sed to strip out only privkey from vanitygen, and my keyfmt to encrypt that with pwd test123, outputting encrypted=%e and address=%a)

He's not being funny either. The only method of mining that has any chance of creating bitcoin worth more than the electricity cost is with large ASIC units. They cost more than ~ $1000 each (except old units which you can buy cheap but they will lose money too). Mining stopped being something you could do for profit on a generic personal computer in about 2011, and stopped being feasible with GPU cards in 2013. It's only ever been profitable to those with cheap electricity but many did mine because they wanted clean btc and didn't mind the higher cost.

You can but not always and not with any guarantee. There is a simple algorithm that can be mostly certain about many cases. 
I'd like to dig it up again (in detail) because I'm only going by memory right now but I do recall that one check is if the amount is larger than any input then it is not change (otherwise the wallet would not have included that input). A few logical tests like that works except in cases where the wallet may be intentionally illogical (known cases?), and in cases where the logic is inconclusive and you just choose "the smallest output" for no better reason.
edit: I'd also note that up til some time (was it in 2012?) there was a bug that made it certain when using bitcoin-qt. Early versions always put the change last (if I recall correctly) rather than in random order.

If you live in Sala Daeng then, yes, you'll pay a lot more rent and everything will be more costly. But living across the river, or even across the city, is not by any stretch a slum. I lived there on/off for 16 years, in many locations, and had a Thai wife. I paid from 4200 to 10,000 baht /mo. rent depending on location. The higher one was for a 3 floor row house with a nice roof "garden". I'm aware there are business men and teachers at private schools who live in Sala Daeng paying 75,000/mo rent for a small apartment but that is not necessary. Hence, my initial statement that they must be basing the cost on a pretty nice lifestyle. Having grown up in Canada I'm aware what is nice or not, and if you don't need everything fancy and high class then you can live in Bkk for a lot less than they say. My $500 is accurate but it does not include alcohol, or Soi Cowboy entertainment, because I never spent money on that. It also helps to not spend your money at farlang hangouts and spots. For one year I lived in a townhouse 30 m from the beach near Phetchaburi for 3800 baht/mo (but that was back in 2008, and now it's more like 5000 baht/mo.). Inflation has not even been bad there in my 16 years. Food has gone up but not that much.

The entropy is fully encoded because the overall bit size is 264 bits. 
The last 8 bits checksum can be deducted and still have expected 256 bits.
24 x 11 = 264 subtract 8 bits checksum leaves 256 bits data.
Same for other word counts. eg. 132 - 4 bit chk = 128 bits.

If you don't provide a password then the seed is stored without encryption - so, yes, anyone on the system that has read access to the file can view the seed.
You don't need to use the same password if you restore on a second system but it would be wise to use some (strong) password. Also, choosing "full file" encryption is stronger than not.

I was thinking about this afterwards and decided there is no advantage to using IP over just a random index. The generated address will be random so it cannot be "preloaded" as any attacker won't know the xpub. You need a db record anyway even with IP so may as well use a random index and clean the db after some time out period (same as caching). It would be important to check each address against current db and repeat gen if already assigned. 
If worried about repeat address requests from an attacker then add an IP column and return the last address until some timeout cleaning removes it.

The raspi will be using ext4 (linux) format by default. So to access that on Windows you need to add something that supports that. IIRC there is an ext4 driver somewhere. ~~Wait a sec and I'll go google for ya and report back.~~

Once you have the external drive visible in windows explorer then just set the datadir to relevant path.

Sure, over wifi, and there is (low-speed) free public wifi all over Bkk (in addition to cafes, some malls, and mobile prepaid cards). Regular ATM withdrawl (from int'l accounts) fee is 150 baht, and even currency exchange booths charge 23 baht (or maybe more now, I haven't checked in years). So the fee is very good in comparison. The exchange rate isn't bad either, especially when compared to local booth rates instead of theoretical online rates. For me, with a US bank I calculated that under 7500 baht it's cheaper to use this, and I'd probably use it even if it cost a bit more.

Very easy. Any 7-11, and many other market stalls, no questions asked, for cash. I bought a new one for my Android phone last fall for 50 baht. They even let you select from phone numbers they have in stock. Probably difficult to get for btc directly here. 
Can also refill at 7-11 or at phone topup machines (which they should upgrade to sell bitcoin) seemingly in your face every time you turn around. You can top up phone balance with btc at several online sites, and I've often done that (no fee, close to zero exchange loss). 
Thai people do commonly transact small amounts of cash by sending phone credits as you can easily transfer p2p (number to number), though it is less common than cash. Cash is very much  in Thailand and unlike the trend in Western countries there is no hint of that changing. Credit card uptake is low.

Once you have a wallet you get an address and paste that into Coinbase when you choose withdraw as Bitcoin. I don't use Coinbase so I can't say much about how they charge fees or not or what the web page looks like. Just be sure that you double check the address that is being submitted before clicking because there is malware out there that can change the address while on the clipboard. Not too likely but always check addresses when you paste them in anywhere.
If you have choice of fee then I just sent a tx an hour ago for 20 sat/byte and it went through pretty quick. But I think Coinbase pays the fee unless that has changed lately.

If the seed is BIP39 compatible then you can recover it on Electrum and get an history/balance right away (seconds). If it has substantial btc then you are best to do recovery on an offline system and copy the xpub (master public key) to your desktop for a watch-only (safe) recovery - otherwise doing seed recovery online is only as safe as  your system being malware free.

Using openssl library or if not then another ec library.
I have some code written in Python that shows both using a library and doing it with math primitives. If you use the bare math code you can extract pubkeys without any external library. Well, you'll need some way to handle big numbers as unlike python that doesn't come for free with C/C++.
BTW that code is for generating keys from electrum seeds but it's the same - just ignore the initial seed to key step and use random number source instead.

Depends on the amount in question. With blockchain.info you have pretty much the worst of both worlds. You are responsible for your own backup (they can't help you if backup lost) and where you keep it, but also open to online hacking via email account hijacking or phishing sites if you're not careful.
If it's a substantial amount then since you are responsible for securing the backup you may as well go fully offline for better security and use Electrum (more flexible/convenient if spending often) or a BIP38 (encrypted) paper wallet.
blockchain.info has had demonstrated problems with backups in the past though it mostly hinges on how careful you are.

They aren't prevented. Who ever said they were? It's not about preventing rich people from entering Bitcoin - it's that they enter Bitcoin on Bitcoin terms. ie. they cannot abuse their wealth to print bitcoins when others cannot. So, no license to counterfeit as we have with central banking.
I can almost guarantee that, people being the way they are, and as we already see, some people will be willing to let others hold their bitcoins for convenience and that will lead to abuse just as it did with gold. The nature of Bitcoin is that you don't **have to do that** and the abuse is limited in effect. MtGox collapsing didn't kill Bitcoin, though the shear size of holdings and number of people trusting them did mean the effect was significant.

They can make a statement that any fake information reported will result in those donations being diverted to charity because what else can they do when people donate with fake info. They could even pre-emptively set that up and make a statement on the site.
But then they're open to the reverse abuse. Any one wanting to deprive them of funds could report real known supporter addresses as fake. So even supporters then need to donate with fake addresses. So eventually they probably need to take a phone # and call each one to manually verify and ask directly "are you an American?". 
So then the smear campaign hires a telephone service, or releases an app that allows any smear-supporter to answer random fake calls. Sigh.

Maybe I remember wrong but I think F-Droid requires a license that is compatible with GPL, ie. allows redistribution passing on freedoms. Mycelium uses the MSFT-RSL license which disallows redistribution and is for research purposes. So you can read the code but not pass it on. I think it's only one part that has that but that's probably enough to bar it.

Power is not energy. It makes no sense to say power per btc. 
Its like saying it takes 96 HP to make a btc. Nonsensical without a unit of time the power is applied over. In this case on average 10 minutes since that how long the electricity is used to make one btc.
Your home electric meter measures energy in kWh - power x time.
The way you stated this figure it's unclear if you actually mean 97.6 MWh (how electrical energy is measured), or 97.6 / 6 = 16.3 MWh (what you get by applying 97.6 for only 10 minutes).

This is wrong on several points, though the price would obviously skyrocket. First, he could not buy what is not being sold. And even then what is being sold is at the price demanded by the seller, but, when he has substantial bitcoins, assuming he doesn't turn around and start selling, the lack of bitcoin available for sale will maintain a high price, though probably not as high as during his buying phase. It certainly wouldn't revert to what it is now since there will be very few bitcoin offered for sale and likely even more demand due to the effect of people making huge returns off Bill Gates back. Which all points back to why he's not stupid enough to attempt such a cornering of the market.

You could create a series of [CLTV addresses]( and pre-made spend txs that move btc from each address to your son's wallet.

Why would they go that route vs. just altering the bitstream compilers (which are all very proprietary). I'm not aware of any Open Source tool to generate the bitstream but I've been out of it for a few years and so maybe there is more options now.

Each commit is validated by one or more devs before it is done. If they can attach a "significance / importance" factor to each commit then that would go a long way to determining which are worth more or less. Maybe GitHub cannot handle tagging that factor but a secondary program could attach it linked by commit hash, and have a neutral default perhaps. eg. 1.0 for neutral, lower for less significant and higher for very significant.
Or this determination could be "crowd sourced" from amongst the devs, by allowing any to assign a value and combining them weighted by dev activity.

Yes, that works. Many people sync on a fast desktop and then move hd to raspi. Just be sure you shut down bitcoin cleanly, eg. `bitcoin-cli stop`.
I'd also suggest, if you have a spare unused disk, that you make a backup after sync and periodically as it's not that uncommon to get corrupted blockchain data and have to start over.
Also, just so you know, you can save only the "blocks" subdir and rebuild from that later but it will redo the validation. This is useful for giving the blockchain to others without them having to trust your data.

Just saw your other post saying 1.4 sat/byte - very low fee. Right now it's needing about 20-30 sat/byte to confirm. A while ago that was 8-10 sat/byte. You paid a very low fee and when the network has low tx volume that works but not right now.
I don't think you can do RBF (replace by fee) with Mycelium to bump fee but if you are sending to an address you own then there is ways of doing CPFP (child pays for parent) to help it confirm quicker. But if you don't need it right away then don't worry - it's in the queue and will confirm when the network slows down.

If you add cosignor seeds or xprv then it defeats the purpose of being multisig - it's back to essentially being single sig because all the signing keys are on the one system. The purpose of using xpubs is that one system/wallet cannot sign the tx alone. The xpubs allows creating addresses but signing a tx requires xprvs (private keys)(which is one step derived from the seed).
So, ya, in summary DON'T do this unless you are intending to disable/bypass multisig security.
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:15:17
If worried about that then I'd suggest decoding and examining every transaction before broadcast. You can do that easily with sites like coinb.in, or if you trust electrum (check the code) then preview before broadcast. Both ways and others will show you every detail of the signed tx.
@_date: 2019-09-02 21:17:39
There is another way but it requires logging IP address for each address provided. You use the IP address as index on xpub for address gen. You have to log the IP in DB so that later the wallet can recover but if this was an actual site using it then it would be smart to use a intermediary wallet where you sweep balances every N txs to a backend or possibly exchange wallet. Most businesses will end up doing that anyway. Besides, worst case is ~~16 million~~ (oops, mistake) addresses to scan, or less if hashed/mapped to a smaller address space first. Most real sites log IP anyway so even an nginx plugin that pulls from server logs may work without added DB. Just some ideas to ponder.
I'd probably do something like map the full IP range down to one million indice values. That way even if the index db is corrupt/lost it's only one million to full recover with an xpub.

Write small words on both sides and then have them use a brainwallet site. For low value and with 8-12 random words it should be adequate security.

You keep mentioning blockchain and I think you mean blockchain.info. In that case that wallet has a history of poor code and hacks that have actually lost users btc. Someone posted on here just a week ago or so who lost thousands of $$ using that wallet and it has been ongoing for years. I'd recommend you not use that one. 
There are many good ones like Mycelium, Electrum (see bitcoin.org wallet selector). or if you just want an account for a small amount keep it on the exchange (Coinbase,etc). Ideally you use your own wallet software as that gives you full control (power) over the btc and also you learn more about Bitcoin to use it.

It would be recorded in the blockchain but not in a way you can use without your private key. 
I'd bet whatever site you used to buy them is gone now. Most likely you used MtGox and it's gone. But if you moved the btc to your wallet then the keys would be on the hard disk and if you didn't back them up then they're gone and the btc are inaccessible.

Some things to note:
1. Just because it came from a mtgox address doesn't mean mtgox sent it. This is exactly how it would look if some random user decided to send some of their btc (in their own mtgox account) to that address.
2. At that date btc was worth around $5 - so you're talking about ~$14 worth not thousands $$.
3. As to "why" - we'll never know unless you can find who did it; which is impossible - even if they came forward you could not get a signed msg confirming ownership since the origin address was owned by mtgox and they would have the private key.

Does pywallet even support generation? I think it's used to dump the wallet.dat from bitcoin core. I could be wrong though. 
If you want a simple key / address generation program for the cmd line then check out vanitygen. It works fine to produce regular addresses even though it was created for vanity (prefix) ones. And it's fast. Good if you need thousands or millions of them. But you still need to import them into a wallet after.

The blockchain (as maintained by bitcoind) is a db but it has limited query facilities. Each index requires a large amount of additional space and afaik there is no way to do relationship query. With SQL you get a language for powerful querying. Another thing is that bitcoind consumes a lot of space (more than 50%) storing signature data which once validated is not useful for any typical db queries. So with sqlchain that data is (optionally) discarded for compactness. If sqlchain is setup using the MyRocks engine (available in mariadb) then you can have full indexing of full blockchain data in about 50% the space of the blockchain. So also a savings there. sqlchain will run on top a pruned node. It will process new blocks into mysql and then let bitcoind discard them. It also supports reading block files directly so it can process while bitcoind is still syncing (usually the rpc interface becomes too slow otherwise). The main downside is it takes a lot of time to process the full chain, and it absolutely needs an SSD (due to index building) whereas bitcoind works well with a hard disk. sqlchain provides a web api layer on top that has access to SQL and supports custom plugins so it's very useful as a direct backend for web apps which otherwise requires some layer between rpc and a web app that may not be able to do the queries needed for the app.
Lastly, and not of much interest here, sqlchain has altcoin support and is user extendablle for more coins, which all have the same interface and query abilities.
Another down side is that I don't get much time to work on it now and it's been a year since I did any updating or new work. It does have segwit and bech32 support but it's not fully realized in the api yet.

Use Electrum and enable the "Coin" tab (menu View, Show Coins). Then on the coin tab you can see each utxo ("coin") and right click one or more and choose "Spend". It will add just those to the Send screen. Then you can choose Max or manually set value and fee. Click "Preview" and see that everything is as you like before signing with Ledger.
The search term you want is "coin control". Some wallets have but most do not.
btw do not send back to orignating address but to your own deposit address. If you send to the address it was sent from then you likely will have a battle to claim they are yours at the exchange. Maybe this is obvious to you but just clarifying - only send to address they have given you for credit to your account.

You don't need a VPS for EPS. You can simply install it on your node following steps on github install guide. EPS doesn't use much space or cpu as it basically just adds a bunch of addresses to your node wallet and then bridges that to Electrum. You actually have a watch-only wallet in bitcoind which Electrum can query via EPS.
I'm not aware of Zap details but any external user/software that wants to connect to your node will need a way to find. If you have a fixed IP at home then just use the IP but if the IP is dynamic (your ISP changes it periodically as is common with ADSL lines) then the simplest way is to create a domain (eg. freedns) and point it using a dynamic dns script/client. On freedns they have some example scripts you can run on your node to do the IP updates using simply a cronjob. This is very simple and adds next to no resource overhead on the node. They give instructions for adding the script to cron (installed already by default on your node). Every 5 minutes or so a request is made to freedns which updates any IP change that may occur.
There are other ways of avoiding dynamic dns using a reverse tunnel. It's not simpler to setup but it avoids forwarding a port on your router - yet another topic separate from dynamic dns.
There's many ways to set things up. For example, I run a pruned node on my laptop with EPS and Electrum locally. And I have a full node at home on my media server. When at home I connect my pruned node to that node so it gets all info from the full node (add connect line in conf). But if I'm away I disable that so it updates normally (p2p network). This means I don't need to do dyndns and port forwarding but I give up a few GB on my laptop to a secondary node.

The simple way is to make a Mint "Live USB". That's just writing the install image to usb as explained on their site. That will be read only but you can easily install bitcoin (`sudo apt install bitcoind`) and use it temporarily. It will not be there if you boot again but it will be able to access the hd and sync. 
The more complicated way needs two usb sticks and you install  from the "Live USB" to the second one. This creates a "real" usb system that remembers across boots - which may be handy long term but is an extra step for your immediate needs.

When you don't run a node you depend on another node operator to look up address info and send txs. So obviously they can log and track any of that info - addresses, txs, association of addresses into a wallet, inferred balance and activity.
Electrum uses many random servers so that info will get spread around to multiple nodes. It sends hashes of addresses but not xpubs. It has to share IP address or it cannot transfer data at all. You generally have no idea who they are run by or if they trade info. If you aren't worried about privacy then that's fine. If you would like some privacy then you can run Electrum with your own node and not share that info using something like electrum-personal-server (EPS).
Most other wallets generally request data from their operators node and could log any of it. Some provide an ability to connect to your own node. Bitcoin txs do not contain an IP address. So if you run your own node then the only way to get IP info is by listening to many nodes at once and infer IP by tx first seen node IP. I've seen it reported that's about 30% likely to be correct. So to do better you'd want to use Tor with your node to ensure txs cannot be traced to an IP. But otherwise, a node is private because it gets ALL tx data and outside viewers cannot tell what part you are interested in.
Going to an explorer site and pasting your address is also a good way to leak info. If they log that with your IP address it may be interesting to someone.

Your 24 word seed should be written down and stored safely. You do not use it for the transfer - you never enter it on any exchange or website, or anywhere else in fact. Any person or service which gets your seed words can steal your btc. Keep that seed safe. 
You will take an address from your wallet (whether ledger or any other software) and give that to your exchange as destination for sending your btc. You do not need to be connected or online at all to receive your btc. They go to that address you gave. Later, when your wallet syncs to the network/blockchain, and once the tx has confirmed, it will show up in your wallet.

I recall people predicting this before the last halving. The argument was that mining would be so unprofitable when it dropped from 50 to 25 that mining would collapse. The fact is the difficulty has adjusted by 100% upwards many times and miners have dealt with the same effect many times over between each halving. Miners will continue to mine because they will be expecting a price adjustment upward, and when they drop off, as they will eventually, it will be incremental, not all at once.

Yes, but you'd have to write some code to do it. Electrum is open source so you can read the code and see how it queries the server. A minimal script to do that probably wouldn't be hard. I've thought about doing this but am still busy on other stuff.
This simplest way is to create a watch-only "import" wallet with an address in it. I have a simple script to automate that if using the gui is not what you need.

During 2012 people were already doing dollar cost averaging at $20/week. Over a year that's $1000 and during 2011 that was mostly in the $5-10 /btc range or about 100-200 btc. So now that has a value of $600,000-$1,200,000 was it worth it? The key is not to give in to temptation to sell it for some transient need or to flip a quick profit. Over the long term hodlers increasingly make btc more scarce and that is what keeps it on an upward trajectory.

I thought I read once that many affiliate members get paid in gift cards because they don't have suitable banking. If they cannot use them to buy on Amazon because they are foreigners and shipping is expensive or unavailable, or maybe they want to buy food and pay rent, then they are willing to accept discounts to turn them into btc that they can sell locally for cash. Which isn't to say that stolen codes are not possible, but rather there is also some legit reasons.

If by sidechains you mean Lightning Network (since that's what people are talking about and waiting for) then the same miners as now. LN doesn't have a separate sidechain or "coin". It's a clever protocol layer over Bitcoin that still uses Bitcoin trxs (enhanced multisig and time locks) to hold btc in open channels but with commits that prevent abuses. So you have sets of partially signed trxs that don't need to be broadcast until the channel closes or co-operation fails, hence saving space but still using btc as currency and the existing chain to finalize. SW is changes to how blockchain data is organized, saving space, with technical fixes to support LN "chained open trxs" and fix malleability which prevents LN from being workable. So it's not a case of some sidechain that is not Bitcoin but technical changes that allow building on Bitcoin with added protocols much like you can layer open HTTP connections over TCP/IP. Miners would still be handling trxs that open/close channels. LN nodes would be tracking a channel state that consists of altering partially signed unbroadcast trxs (basically, though I'm sure it will become more sophisticated as they are already testing onion routing ideas to allow private anonymous channels). The LN multisig chained trxs allow moving btc without giving up custody ie. non-custodial agents forming a network to route pmts.

I know myself and probably many of us, now aware of the attack, just would like to get our txs unstuck. I don't mind paying a higher fee but I cannot double spend to do that. It appears there are ~21,000 txs in the 11-40 sat/byte range that have been there for nearly 24 hours. I'm in the middle there somewhere. 
It's not rational for miners to mine lower fee txs first but they could flush them from their mempools along with some nodes that serve pushtx pages so that users stuck here can re-send. I know how to do a double spend but keep getting rejected.
Another thought that occurred to me was that a benevolent miner could pack a few blocks with these mid-fees txs to clear them. I wonder what the total loss would be for that? 21,000 txs x (60-20) sat/byte x 300 (est.tx) = 2.52 btc.
Anyway, I have upgraded to Electrum 2.7 (with RBF) now to avoid this in future.

Once the repos are updated you simply use apt-get:
    sudo apt-get update 
    sudo apt-get upgrade 
It should see the new version and upgrade it. This requires you have already added the repo for bitcoin to your /etc/apt/sources (usually done using add-apt-repository). 
I usually use Raspbian on raspberry pi so I can't say if normally that would be already done for you. I know for me I just upgrade from the regular debian repo, but it may take a bit longer for the debian build to make it to Ubuntu. According to [this repo page]( it's still on 0.15.1 (not surprised as it usually takes a while to get updated).
You can manually update from the [bitcoin.org downloads]( page but be sure you use the correct armhf version. In this case you download, extract and copy the new binary files over the old in /usr/local/bin. 
If you want to do it this way (probably only way right this moment):
    wget 
    tar -xzvf bitcoin-0.16.0-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz
    sudo cp -r bitcoin-0.16.0/* /usr/local/
Then `bitcoin-cli stop` and start it as usual again. I just did this on my raspbian based pi and it worked fine.

I have tried BIP32 restore in Electrum but not from bitcoin-cli. I used a Mycelium seed phrase in Electrum and it did work - it gave the same address list and restored my entire tx history matching Mycelium. I guess bitcoin-cli is different somehow or you did something dfferent. Just in case it helps here's what I did that worked ok.
1. Start Electrum.
2. Choose File, New/Restore.
3. Enter the file name you want.
4. Choose standard wallet.
5. Choose "I already have a seed".
6. Click options and choose BIP39 seed.
7. Paste the 12 seed words. Click Next.
8. Leave account number at zero value. Click Next.
9. Enter a password if you like (doesn't need to be same). Next.
It took a while to sync because I have quite a few txs but it did work. Maybe bitcoin-cli uses a different account number than zero? That would also cause different addresses from same seed.
@_date: 2016-10-30 01:32:16
In the console window or command line script try,
    for x in range(0, 50):
     print wallet.create_new_address()
You can use whatever count value you need. I'm assuming you restored the BIP32 seed word list to create the wallet so that it can create new addresses (and not just imported keys to a non-hd wallet).
Also, if you just need to confirm the initial 20 addresses then simply pressing Ctrl-A will show the address tab and that has the first 20 already generated.

Electrum works great as an offline wallet. See the docs on how to sign offline and use a watch-only wallet on your desktop to create txs. It's a bit more hassle than using a hw wallet but it is perfectly workable for people with a bit of tech ability. For tech illiterates it's better to stick with a hw wallet.

You're better off using Tails on USB stick, or building your own Ubuntu USB stick if you prefer, and keep it safe. Reasons:
1. More secure as you are only exposed online **once** and never again. You risk corrupted code only once not every time you rebuild for sending.
2. Easier, quicker. Slow hard processes will be short cut when in a hurry.
3. Less prone to mistakes because only need to do it right one time.
4. If source was tampered with then it will be discovered fairly quickly by the developers or users. Probably not quick enough if you are using it right away, but quick enough if you have a USB stick from last week/month you are still using. ie. You can set up the stick and wait a week to check it wasn't made with code later found out to be hacked.
I've used the USB stick Electrum offline signing for 9 months now and before that I used a dedicated offline Electrum install for 2 years. It's a good methodology. I do keep the seed on the USB stick, encrypted, but it's maybe safer to enter it each time. For that I would need an active paper copy of the seed to enter from (no way I trust my memory) rather than one stored safely. For my situation I figure that is worse than someone getting the USB stick off me and cracking the encryption. 
All security methods have different attack profiles so it's a matter of choosing which better suits you, who may attack you and how specific and dedicated they are.
In any case with offline signing you're already protected from all the most common attacks most people get stung by and after this you are dealing with either very rare possibilities or very targeted specific ones.

Think of a transaction as a square. When the length of the side is small the area is small. When the length goes up the area goes up as the square of that. Verifying is like working on each square unit in sequence. So a 2x2 square is like 4 work units to complete. A 20x20 square is 400 work units, and so on. This is what the O(n^2) indication means. The problem is that as you make a block bigger the worst case work to be done (when it has one large non-coinbase tx) goes up as the square and can be used as an attack to bring the network to a standstill. Not that every block would be like that but fixing this is important to do before allowing it to scale.
SegWit makes the work linear - so a 2x2 square needs 2 work units, and 20x20 only 20 work units. Once you have that it's much safer to make bigger blocks.

I wondered myself if a spam attack was meant to prevent bitcoiners from moving coins to exchanges to sell. That would reduce supply and cause the price to move up. So to benefit you would buy early, constrain supply, and then oversell (short), and then cut the spam. It seems pretty far fetched to me but I did wonder. Or it might be a way to cover the spam attack cost.

Internationally only for Alliance network banks. In Thailand the local banks add a hefty fee and I've not heard of any "home" banks covering that. I know my US bank doesn't but in sympathy they add their own $2.50 fee!  And they even add that to visa charges now too.
Nowadays it costs me ~ $10 for each ATM withdraw but this last year I've 100% used BTC instead so they have lost out. BTC Fee ~$1 but typically the exchange rate has been better than US exchanges and it's made up for it. Certainly way better than the ATM network exchange rate (typically 0.5% below net quote).

There is some levels like this in place. Nodes can utilize pruning to discard old data after it's been verfied. There still needs to be some percent of nodes that have all data to be able to supply new nodes starting up. For handling only your own wallet you need recent blocks and what's called the UTXO (unspent tx output) set. If you have verified the chain then the UTXO is enough data to detect new txs for your wallet. Of course, I'm simplifying things but, yes, there are different depths of data for different needs. Required space can be as low as a few GBs.
@_date: 2016-10-21 02:10:48
Electrum also allows for a watch-only (MPK - master public key) wallet. So you can create your mnemonic offline, write it down securely, then export the MPK to usb stick (or snap a photo of the QR code), and bring it to your online system. On this system you may have both the daily low-value wallet and create a watch-only wallet from the MPK. You cannot send btc with the MPK but you can create addresses, unsigned trxs and watch any activity. Only when you want to send from the offline wallet would you need to use the mnemonic again to sign a trx (offline) created with the watch-only wallet. This methodology allows using the offline wallet without exposing it online.
Also, for low cost offline wallet a Raspberry Pi works very well with Electrum. To access the wallet you simply hook up a keyboard and HDMI TV, and boot up. Either enter the mnemonic each time or use the uSD card as wallet with passphrase. 
You can use the watch-only online wallet to create a trx, save it to a usb stick and open on the offline wallet. I've been using this type of offline signing with raspberry pi and/or usb boot OS for years. If the Raspi has a camera you can move trxs by QR code instead of usb stick. Also, the new Electrum Android app allows doing similar - watch only on the phone, sign on the offline wallet system.

Github is simply a service used by the devs. There are already 4691 forks of Bitcoin on GitHub. That means that even if the official bitcoin github was locked up there are already that many copies in other people's hands. And for each fork almost assuredly at least one copy off of Github, since most users fork on Github and pull it to their own system.
There is absolutely no problem with enough copies of the source code or any dependence on GitHub as a company. Any issues regarding dev control centres around their influence and decisions regarding what they choose to work on, commit and/or recommend. 
Development would probably be more hindered by shutdown of communication via irc channels and bitcointalk.org, and that would be brief until alternates were worked out.

Long complex story. But in short they issued notes that were exchanged for the multitudes of bank IOUs existing that represented deposits of gold at banks. Of course, banks handed out extra paper (IOUs, loans) based on their gold deposits hoping all depositors would not withdraw at once. This evolved over time to a complicated system based on central banks and reserve ratios and where  money is created as loans to borrowers. ie. it's all vapour not backed by actual gold deposits (since the early 70s).

There's an established algorithm for this. I haven't been able to locate it recently but if someone here knows the bitcointalk page (circa. 2011/12) where it is described please post it.
I know it involves comparing input-output amounts. eg. if the output is larger than any input it cannot be change or the input would not have been included. There is a series of checks like that that can make it certain in many cases (barring explicit non-standard fudging of input-outputs to obscure change).
It would be interesting to run a blockchain scan testing that algorithm to see in what percent of trx the change output can be determined.

The main limit on real gift cards is you can usually only spend them to the card issuer, and not get a refund.

Here's something I just tried but I don't know if it matches bitcoin-cli. Electrum does allow pasting a hex seed value instead of a word list, and it does allow selecting BIP39 for that. If BIP39 is how the mnemonic is generated and BIP32 is how the hd structure is organized then maybe pasting the hex seed value with BIP39 enabled will allow it to generate the correct wallet. I tried it and it did generate a wallet without error but I don't have a bitcoin-cli wallet to check it against. So, same process I described above but instead of pasting word list you'd paste hex seed value.

I've already worked out the hack for re-spending from within Electrum. I prefer to do it this way as it's an offline wallet. I can create a new tx in Electrum and sign it again offline (no need to expose keys). So far I have not found any sites that will successfully push it. They all return errors about spent outputs. So, for now I'm waiting for the original to be dropped.
BTW the method I use for re-spending is a few simple edits in the wallet file. Backup first obviously. Look for the last tx in the verified_tx3 section. Note it's first few digits. Now look in the transactions, txi and txo sections and remove the records that follow this noted one being careful to get the trailing comma on the previous one. That should clean up the unconfirmed tx. Now disconnect so it doesn't sync again. Create the tx you want again with higher fee and save to disk. Sign offline (or online) and save to disk. Reconnect and load the tx from file. It will let you send but probably gets a spent outputs error. You can open the file and select the hex raw tx digits for pasting into a push site, but all ones I've tried have also given spent outputs error.
Once you reconnect the sync will update with the unconfirmed tx again but if you do manage a successful re-spend then it will drop the invalid old one and show the new one confirmed. 
@_date: 2016-10-27 23:55:14

Recent versions (forget which exactly it was added) have an option for soft-limiting the usage. I think it stops supplying blocks at the limit but still maintains it's own operations so it won't just go dead.

Electrum is excellent but also only as safe as the system it's on. If you have a lot then Electrum can be used in an offline signing mode that approaches hardware wallet security. The Android Electrum app is quite slow so many people prefer Mycelium. I've used Electrum for close to 5 years on Linux and lately on Android. It is a good choice but as mentioned for larger amounts you would want to use it offline (not net connected). There are some tutorials around about how to properly do that but it's a bit lengthy for here.
If you don't need daily access to the funds then with Electrum you can backup your seed and keep a watch-only wallet on your system. That's also very safe, assuming the backup seed (multiple copies) is safe.

To have even slight impact you would need to invest millions. If you just want to do it for fun then you could buy a second hand ASIC miner of recent generation and run it at a loss (UK electric rates!). There is some very slight chance you'd find a block after signaling starts Nov. 15th and thereby actually be counted towards the 95% of blocks in a period.  
If you do then be sure to choose a pool that supports SegWit. I think it is bitcoin.com that does not.

I don't know what miners will decide to do but I hope they'll see what's good for Bitcoin users is good for them. LN would allow massive scaling but on chain scaling will still be needed as a base for that because more users will be needing to open channels. That is, I expect LN to increase trx volume on chain but have a multiplier effect for massive volume tiny trxs that users wouldn't want to pay fees for now.
LN network should give you instant (no wait) trxs as you mention for almost free. It won't do that right away when released as it will take time for a network to develop and your friend and cafe would need to be both using LN (having committed btc on the network) or else you'd still need to do regular btc trxs. Presumably wallet software would be able to detect and indicate if LN can be used and take care of underlying details.
LN will work well for fast low value trxs because you won't be able to transact values higher than have already been committed in an open channel. So if you lock 0.05 btc in a channel you would likely be doing many small trxs of even lower value before closing out the channel or rolling it over with an updated commitment. The network would be a mesh of such open commitments and as long as there is a route from you through the mesh to your receiver you can pay that way, details managed by your wallet software (privately).
As one example: it should be feasible for an exchange to use LN pmts for actual trades. That would give users a way to do trading without giving up custody of their btc thereby taking away a lot of the risk involved and reducing the fear of exchanges being hacked. Such hacks would be limited to exchange reserves but not users funds held by exchanges.

A wallet is only a collection of addresses. Associating some using these methods may be incomplete but it does tie some together, and we call that bundle a wallet. IP address in txs is very unreliable but many users voluntarily give up ID or location info to many businesses they deal with and that info is not that secure.
For an example of how much can be extrapolated [see this site]( But note - typing in your address there may be used to associate it to your IP. And in that case it is more reliable because your ISP does know which IP matches you at any moment (unless you are using random public access).
I am far from expert in this. There are people who spend a lot of time on this and probably have better techniques as well.
I don't mean to give the impression everything is traceable. Much is not. It depends a lot on how you use Bitcoin and many users do not pay attention to what they are doing. Kind of like how most people don't pay much attention to public video cameras when they are out.

I don't know if the LN devs have worked out these parameters yet. It would be nice if channel commitments aren't too long but can be rolled over automatically.

I think you under estimate the cost. According to  there has been about 117,000 txs in the target range over the last 24 hours (I may be reading that wrong as it's somewhat unclear). Not all would be spam but other fee ranges which are typically 7,000-15,000 txs. Assuming fees are typically spread evenly across ranges then we may have 100,000 spam txs. At avg. 50 sat/byte x 250 bytes each that would be 12.5 btc, or about $8000/day.

A node is a system running the bitcoin software. Not a wallet, though you may have that too, but the underlying peer in the network. Usually **bitcoind** but there are other choices. This software takes a good chunk of net bandwidth and roughly 90GB of disk space for the full chain; pruning blocks is possible to save space but then not as useful for supplying blocks to new nodes. This software verifies and relays txs and blocks thereby actually forming the network. It's free, open source software anyone can download and run.

It's free open source software developed by many contributors over the last 8 years. I've used it that long and contributed code several times. The main thing to be aware using it is, as with any software, it is only as secure as your computer. If you get malware on your computer then nowadays it often will check for and try to steal from btc wallets. For small amounts it is not a big deal but as you get more value you should read up on using Electrum for "offline signing" or with a hardware wallet. It can do both very well and has many advanced and useful features. It's one of the most used and popular wallets for Bitcoin but it requires you keep your system malware free - no opening random email attachments or pirated software etc.

**Electrum** v1 allowed entering a hex seed value. I don't know if they carried that over for version 2, except maybe as a v1 compatibility mode. If you entered a hex seed as a restore then you could later show the 12 word seed from the menu item.
I did create a hex value from coin flips, eg. 4 coins gives 4 bits, easy to mentally convert to a hex digit, and enter. So 32 tosses of 4 coins done with a cup, gives an offline seed.
I think I later upgraded to v2 and it accepted the seed, though I'm a bit fuzzy on that now and any trials should be tested first.
**edit:** just tested on Electrum v2 and it does allow restoring with a 32 digit hex seed, and then you can show the seed words with menu item Wallet, Seed. As long as your hex value is "truly random" then you still have 128 bits of entropy, and a usable wallet.

When you use an online wallet the address is not owned by you - that is if you don't have the private key then they are custodian of your address. Online wallets usually do move btc around, either making payouts or to cold storage for security. So you should not expect the address balance to remain there or be the same. What matters is that they have your true account balance recorded in their database and that is what they use to determine how much they can give back to you later when you withdraw.
So, nothing wrong here, move on.

You can get very close to HW wallet security for near zero cost. I mention this not just for you but others browsing here. HW wallets are great but if you don't want to spend the money you are not stuck with using an insecure net connected wallet.
I used a raspberry pi as an offline system for a couple years and since it was also a Kodi media center (when not booted for signing trxs) it cost me nothing more than an extra SD card with Rasbian and Electrum installed. 
But even a USB boot stick with Debian (or Tails) and Electrum installed and only ever booted on a disconnected system gets very close. Technically it's probably not quite as good but in the real world with a small bit of diligence it works as well and costs nearly nothing.
Either of these methods require care to boot up only disconnected and to inspect trx addresses / amounts while signing trxs on the offline system. With Electrum the offline signing process is simple and only takes 2-3 minutes longer than using an insecure online wallet. That extra time is mostly waiting for booting and checking trx details.
Anyone interested in this should google Electrum offline signing.

To make that claim you would have to show that the buys of long term holders as a percent is steady even as volume increases. I doubt that is the case. Probably as volume has risen the long term buys as percent have dropped appropriate to a consistent amount of buying.

Mycelium is top rated on Android. It doesn't require downloading the blockchain and it can run ok with slow internet access. Copay is also reputable along with a few others.
If you're out there in the wilderness then you should probably not worry about a full node wallet unless you have some specific reason for that. You can run a node somewhere more suitable like in a data center server and then run the wallet locally with an RPC interface to your own node. That RPC connection can be low bandwidth and would run fine from a remote place. ie. your blockchain is on a server but bitcoin-qt wallet interface is on your laptop deep in the jungle over a secure tunnel (easy to set up). 
Of course, a server with 90G+ of space isn't really cheap or free. If you have a friend you trust to run a node then you can tunnel to that one.

The problem is that PP transfers can get reversed when paid by a fraudulent user (PP account hack/theft) - and BTC cannot be reversed. So you can send BTC and think you got paid but later have the funds taken back by PP to cover fraud. 
So your best bet if you must do this is to choose carefully who you trade with. LocalBitcoins is a good site but individual traders using the site can scam you and that will not be made right by the site. That's why people here say choose a trader carefully, with many trades, long history and 100% or near positive feedback. You still can get scammed but the chance is lower with better traders. I've done this several times and it has worked out fine but it can also not. Break large amounts into several smaller trades or just don't risk it if you cannot afford the loss.

I meant that by it's nature this graph doesn't show us what's going on because it's including the "attacking" trxs as well as "user" trxs. So, sticking with blockchain.info graphs this other one paints a different picture: 
Here we see that generally there is a mempool trx count in the few thousand but now and then "something" causes it to spike very high. I call it a "spam" attack but maybe it's some legit business doing something they consider legit. I kind of doubt it. Now combine that info with this other chart: 
Here we see two "walls" of unconfirmed trxs. One with low values of &lt;10 sat/byte (which nowadays is really too little anyway, and so not very harmful), and then another at about 40-60 sat/byte. If you send a trx that used fees below this then you are going to wait a long time for these ones to be confirmed first. Above this wall there are relatively few higher fee trxs - these are the guys who bump their fees high enough to avoid the spam. 
I sent a trx this morning using double my normal fee (that I have typically used a lot over the last few months). I thought that would do it but it also happens this trx was bigger today (1000 bytes instead of around 300 bytes), and so I actually should have paid about 8x higher than I normally do. My fault for not using some auto-calculated fee, or maybe that wouldn't have worked well anyway. Not sure. I did try to include a high enough fee but miscalculated due to larger trx size. If I had quadrupled my fee it would be above the "spam" threshold. And I don't mind that, but I'd have to upgrade to RBF to allow me changing that now.
I'm very much a supporter of the roadmap for SegWit so I'm not jumping up and down about needing bigger blocks (yet). I may start a node just so I can signal positive for SW. But todays delays are very real and denying them is just as bad as shouting that big blocks would fix them. I don't think caving in to such spam attacks is the right move. Historically from the first graph I linked it seems they don't last that long (because they do cost money to sustain) and this one should peter out soon. Or maybe since SegWit is an approaching threat to the morons using this tactic it will be kept going longer. IDK.

The problem here is not that it's linear or log scale since the variation either way is minimal. I mean it's bouncing in the 9-10 minute area so even linear doesn't clarify.
The real problem is that this graph sheds no light on the problem. It's the **median** so it's showing most trxs cfm time. The problem at hand is that most trxs right now are spam ones no ones cares about - ~25,000 spam trxs all confirming before the ones people care about. So, yes, most trxs still cfm quickly but most are spam and the ones users are shouting about are caught below the threshold of ones getting included.
I've got a trx with double fee paid still waiting and it's annoying but the answer isn't bigger blocks and giving in to spam attacks only sets us up for bigger spam attacks.

LN is a very clever system of partially signed on-chain txs that are only broadcast if necessary to resolve a failure or open/close channels. Provisions for private, anonymous channels and more are being worked on and it just has such promise when you actually get your head around how it works.
It's centralized in the sense that users would interact with some in-between nodes /agents instead of direct peer-peer. 
It is decentralized in the sense that your btc are still on-chain and you still have full control over them aside from commitments you've made that involve others holding partially signed txs. With LN anyone can become a node and offer routing services by managing a set of channel states and in that sense it's still decentralized. It remains to be seen how many LN nodes would pop up, how specialized they would be or whether there will be only a few major players.
It's critical to know that LN doesn't require custodial accounts like banks, nor any other "coin", so LN users are still able to transact with their btc as they wish. What's beautiful is that when things go tits up on a channel you can sign and push a close tx that finalizes your btc balance back to your own wallet.
I expect there will be LN node software much like there is mining or pool software and people will play around with it and setup nodes to route pmts. It's very exciting, and spreads the pmt load across potentially far more nodes than, say, a few majors like  Bitpay and Coinbase. And because a node is managing it's own channel state there is much more tx privacy - most txs aren't broadcast publicly.

1. Usually Electrum will use an available camera as QR code scanner. Either there was some detection issue or you didn't have a camera. No need to buy a special QR scanner - just attach a USB video camera.
2. Best not to ever re-use paper wallets once they have been swept or even been entered on a system. Technically you can still use it but security wise it's no longer offline cold storage.
3. Broadcast sends the sweep transaction to the bitcoin network. So, yes that is required if you want to move funds from one address to another. Save is for saving the trx to file, allowing offline signing (not very useful when you already entered the key anyway). Useful for creating trxs on the system and signing them on another offline system.
4. $0.41 is pretty high. It depends on how many inputs were in the trx (size), age and other factors. You can choose manually in Electrum what fee and rate method you want to use. I generally set it manually at 0.1 mbtc (about $0.065 cents) and get pretty quick confirms. It varies a lot now.
5. Assuming you swept to a new seed based wallet and that wallet is on your system then it is vulnerable to any malware you may get. Even a password is fairly low level protection as malware can just key log to trap your password. Ideally, if we are talking about significant funds and you want to use Electrum, then you should be looking at **Electrum offline signing** methods. Google that. 
**Always write down your seed phrase** and store safely (laminate, put in safe, as you feel adequate etc). It's the only way to recover from a corrupt/crashed/stolen system but it won't protect you from malware. Only an offline wallet can help there (or hardware wallet, of course).

The price change is probably already reflected in the market. It may be that it has risen because it expects the coins will pass from govt to another holder without entering the market.

Well, technically, yes it is. You just need more than one deposit to the address. Then there will be multiple outputs and you might use only one in a new trx. The unused outputs would be left untouched.

No. They just aren't looking at the total fee but the fee per byte - and for that you are still low at 109 sat/byte. So it likely could be dropped eventually but if you wanted to break it on purpose then you would double spend one input with a high (per byte) fee. 
To do that you need a wallet like electrum that will let you create a trick double spend tx and save to disk for manual pushing. It's also possible to do with a tool like  but requires some finessing.
Your best bet long term is to hold the dust and wait for Schnorr sigs to be implemented some day (single sig for large number of inputs). But also those dust outputs are consuming utxo space so the socially nice thing to do is spend them and release that space (not that anyone will buy you a drink for that).

Yes. After about 36 hours. It was my own fault but also bad timing. On other days it would have gone through quite quickly. I even knew of the backlog and manually calculated a fee that I expected would go fast. I tried to use ~100 s/B but screwed it up and somehow actually used ~25 s/B. No idea how - decimal places from sats to mbtc probably. Crazy though because I'm using Electrum and could have let it figure it out.
Hmmm. 1 decimal place out. Tx size off by half (hex vs binary). So /10*2 is fairly close to actual error.

But you intend for the key to be available to someone or not? If the key is supposed to be unavailable then a burn address is good. But if you actually want to use the btc at some future time then obviously a burn address would not be useful here. If you want the address to appear random then that is easy to do - feed output from a RNG into a script like supernova and you get a random address with no key.

Just to clarify, you mean when the second tx uses only entirely new inputs it is dangerous. As long as it re-uses at least one input then it should exclude the original and only one or the other will confirm. So without coin control, or in the special case you are spending the entire wallet, since you cannot be sure about re-use this should not be attempted.

I don't know that you can do anything with blockchain.com's wallet. With Electrum you would have had two options. First, you could mark the tx as RBF (replaceable) which would allow you to later raise the fee (must be chosen when initially sent). Second, because it allows spending unconfirmed tx outputs you could spend the change (to yourself) with a higher fee and miners usually include the first tx because the dependent one has a high fee (called CPFP, child pays for parent). 
@_date: 2015-03-07 17:20:18
The best way to use Electrum as paper wallet is (when in Tails) to write down the seed words safely on paper. Then select menu Wallet, Master Public Keys. That will show you the MPK which you can save to usb stick, or click the QR icon and snap a photo of that. 
Now boot back into you normal Mac desktop and install Electrum. Create a new wallet and enter that MPK, or click scan icon and snap the QR photo back in. This will give you a "watch-only" wallet that lets you safely view your addresses and generate more addresses when connected online. But because the seed remains safely offline on paper it's not possible to spend from that wallet.
When you do want to spend from a watch-only wallet you follow a safe 3 step process for offline signing. You create the transaction in the watch-only wallet and save it to usb stick. Then pull the net cable, reboot into Tails as before, and restore with seed words, load the transaction from usb, sign it and save again. Once again reboot into your normal desktop and load the signed transaction and send it. Your seed is never exposed to the net.
It sounds more complicated then it is and usually you would use this for larger amounts, long term, cold storage. For daily spend amounts you just create a normal desktop wallet (Electrum can have any number of wallets). Reboot to offline to replenish your daily wallet.

You'd need to post tx ids to get real answers. Most likely it's a combination of a congested network and maybe your tx included many small inputs. The tx fee is set by the sender but an adequate value depends on the byte size of the tx and the prevailing network rate (what everyone else is willing to pay to get confirmed). 
The tx byte size depends mostly on input and output count. So if the sending wallet selected many smaller inputs (because no single large value was available), then that pushes size up and a higher fee is needed to get fast confirmation. See  for current network fees on waiting txs (mempool).
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:24:32
This is today, not 3 years ago. And today this is normal. You have an 18Kbyte transaction made up of many, many small inputs. Even a couple years ago this would  have cost you unusually more than a typical tx. Many of your inputs are small enough they aren't worth sending (fee more than byte size of input).
And if you need to place blame then it's not on the cores devs who have been trying to get SegWit pushed through for 8-9 months or more. Blame the miners who refuse to support scaling in order to gain higher fees.
And your posts make you sound like a whiny little punk.

Look into using rpc calls. There's probably a library for php to do that. I know there is a python-bitcoinrpc and others so likely something similar.
Be very careful about having any wallet on a server. For web sites you are much better off using a deterministic wallet where only a master public key is kept online for generating new addresses. 
If you really need to be able to send pmts from an online wallet, and you're asking this level of question, then seek more advanced help as you will otherwise very likely end up being hacked. At least keep tight control over what funds you keep in such a wallet.

Download [Tails]( and make a bootable flash drive. Boot up and use the Electrum pre-installed to create a wallet. Write down the seed words (critical or you cannot access later). That's your wallet.
As for buying with CC... you'll never do that anonymously. Closest to that is to withdraw a cash advance and then use localbitcoins.com to do a local meetup to buy. You meet, hand over cash, and the other person sends btc to the address you provide. 
If you do this then start slowly, practice and get familiar with things before doing some larger amount. And read up on suggestions for safe meetups. Also, realize it's easy to break your anonymity by transacting with anyone who knows your identity/location.

You boot on an offline system, generate your wallet and only copy the master public key (xpub) via a usb stick to take and use on the net connected system. Electrum makes this type of "offline signing wallet" a breeze. Your seed and xprv never even touch an online system. All you actually need is a bootable usb stick; not a dedicated system. A rasp pi makes a super little offline signing unit.

I have an electrum pwd scanner I wrote for someone else. It takes a pwd template and char set string and scans all pwds to find correct one. PM me and I can provide free. Written in python, so helps a lot if you can run a python script (also need aes module installed). I can help a bit if not too time consuming.
Oh, also you only need the xprv from the wallet file to crack it. Scan time depends on your cpu but typical on my old laptop is seconds for 1 char, minutes for 2 chars and 60x longer each added char. You can let it run all day/night. I have a multi-core version too.
If you have no btc on xprv then you could send it to me and I'll scan it but my system isn't very fast. For a few mbtc I could start a VPS instance to run it at higher speed for you (assuming you aren't adept at doing that yourself).
@_date: 2015-11-07 04:37:37
With constant demand the price is much more sensitive to supply because only a small portion of btc are actively traded. If, for example, only 5% are traded then a supply cut of 50% has far greater impact. We saw this with the last halving. People didn't really know what to expect and the market didn't seem to price it in ahead of time, but a couple months after that supply became constrained the price moved up by a 100x (roughly speaking, pre-halving $2 low to post-bubble $200 low).
This time around it's hard to say how much will be priced in ahead of time, and when that will occur, or has occurred already, since people have some history to base upon this time. Maybe it will go up 100x again, or maybe too many are only holding now because they've priced in the next halving.

Assuming you mean blockchain.info and you're using a newer blockchain.info BIP39 wallet then import your seed (you wrote down) into Electrum and stop using their shitty service. They suggest low fees, and then don't drop txs when they are long overdue to be dropped. Seems 80% of problems related to low fees and long, long hold up times come from their wallet. Electrum gives you so much better control and functionality and has a much better stability history.

This sounds like a message by the broadcasting node. You may try another Electrum server to broadcast or if that doesn't work then save the tx to file and copy/paste the raw hex string (w/o quotes) from the file to a [pushtx page]( Otherwise if no node will take it then you'll have to wait for confirmation or adjust the tx to not have that dependency.

I highly doubt LN will result in a total net drop in on-chain trxs. LN users would need to open/close channels and broadcast trxs when channels get broken. I expect it will have a multiplier effect allowing vastly higher trx volume off-chain, and resulting in many new use cases.
As one example: it should be feasible for an exchange to use LN pmts for actual trades. That would give users a way to do trading without giving up custody of their btc thereby taking away a lot of the risk involved and reducing the fear of exchanges being hacked. Such hacks would be limited to exchange reserves but not users funds committed to exchanges. I'm sure there are many more similar possible uses where security (and privacy) can be enhanced with LN.

Check out [pywallet]( for dumping wallet.dat file as json (readable) data. Then you can select keys to import to another wallet like Electrum. If you move to Electrum your best option is to import the keys into a temporary "import" walllet and then send the btc from there to a new deterministic ("standard" or "multisig") wallet. This way you leave your old keys behind and gain the advantages of a seed based wallet.

Scarcity. Same number of people desiring something but much fewer available. In the case of Bitcoin the destroyed ones can never make it to market to be sold and so without that sell pressure the price tends to rise.
Same they do with diamonds being held in vaults to keep the price high.
The price of Bitcoin is entirely based on supply/demand - less supply, same demand = higher price. Wait until the halvening this summer when the constant 25 btc/10 minute creation (supply) gets cut in half. Last time that happened was end of Nov 2012 just before the massive price rise in early 2013.

Maybe eventually we'll see better support for address bundles in wallets. It's quite easy to create a transaction with many outputs and it hinders identifying transaction amounts and destination wallets. The more outputs the more ambiguity. 
Wallets like Electrum allow for "send to many" by pasting in an address list. It's not exactly simple yet, but it is doable. It needs a "randomize output values across N addresses" button to automate this.

The easy way is to just create a transaction sending remaining funds. Probably what's happened is you swept only one key from your wallet and remaining funds are on other keys. A wallet is generally a collection of keys and manages your total balance as a collection of outputs on the various keys within. If you have core output a list of keys/addresses with unspent outputs you'll know how many and which keys to sweep, but as mentioned just sending a tx, if possible, will be the simplest way.

Somewhat, but not very safe. You are much safer with an offline system, or usb boot system or hardware wallet. The encryption is not the issue (though not all encryption is safe, I'd probably not trust anything created by large US corps), but if you get malware on your system there's good odds it will include a key logger that will watch for you entering passwords.

You cannot cancel a transaction. It is out there in some nodes "mempool" but eventually gets dropped. Seems most nodes drop after 72 hours, but some may keep it in memory longer. Mostly you'd be concerned with blockchain.com keeping it in their mempool because having it active prevents you from sending again. They should (and maybe do - I haven't checked) allow you to at least drop it from their pool, which allows spending again. 
I stopped using the blockchain.info wallet many years ago due to many issues (stuck txs wasn't an issue years ago). I know they have a deterministic (seed based) wallet now but I don't know if it's BIP39 compatible (quick google check says it is). If it is then you should have written down the seed words, and those seed words should be usable with Electrum to restore the same wallet (when restoring be sure to click options and choose BIP39). Then you could spend from that wallet and it should allow you to spend as long as the server you connect to isn't still holding the old tx. It also would allow spending the change output (as child tx) even if the tx is still kicking around. And besides, Electrum is a much better wallet (different usage style as well, not being browser based).
Though be aware if you restore from seed words in Electrum then your wallet is exposed to any potential malware on your system. So if the amount stored is high you'd want to look at an offline Electrum wallet.

I guess shortening expiration isn't really the right mgmt method. I always use RBF now anyway but mostly just avoid doing txs now. It's a bit stressful compared to the old days. A shame really.

When you buy 44k btc at an exchange you push the price up quite a bit before you have them. This last week every time 2000-5000 btc were bought in short period it would push the price up around $10-20. Look at bitcoinwisdom.com and see at this moment 3k btc would push the price up $30. But if smart you wouldn't buy them in such big chunks.

What was the rationale for this I wonder? Sure seems likely explanation for mempool explosion and I would have thought reducing to a few hours far more sensible. Why would anyone want to have their tx stuck in the mempool for more than a few hours? How does that serve the btc community at all? I'd love some input from a core dev on why this makes sense. ?
@_date: 2015-03-30 03:37:41
You can't do that because bitcoin.conf is in the data dir, so it can't find bitcoin.conf until it knows the data dir to find it in. ie. chicken-egg problem. Now they could alter the code to search for bitcoin.conf in several locations but I guess they aren't too concerned about flexibility. On linux you can easily use a symlink and, though I haven't used it in years, I think Windows now has symlink equivalents. So you can create a bitcoin dir that "links" to some other drive location, and then bitcoin starts up and works without knowing it's data is linked.

Yes, the balance would. So somehow you must have sent the btc to an address which you don't own. Or, check the exact time of that tx on a block explorer and see if it's not when you would expect it to be. If it is at some time when you were not doing this moving of btc then I'd assume someone somehow got in and did it. So, the question now is where did that address come from then? Copy/paste mistake maybe? If you can figure out who owns it then there is still a chance you can make a plea with them to return it.

Cold storage can also be an offline "seed" used to generate keys, and allows creating new addresses online while keeping the keys safely offline. Have a look at using Electrum for cold storage. It's more flexible when you decide to spend some portion of your btc, amongst many benefits over a single paper wallet. Creating a [Tails]( boot usb stick and booting after disconnection is probably the simplest approach here.

It's got nothing to do with shitty code. You can use the number 666 as a master **public key** (or seed or private key) if you like. Math is math, and only you will suffer from such choices. Don't go sending money to some address you don't have and can never have a matching **private key** to spend from. 
I didn't believe this was a real situation but apparently you did this and it's real, so I can only offer my condolences. Seriously, I'm not laughing at your misfortune, just shaking my head you would do that without knowing what you were doing. A little bit too impulsive maybe.

Coinbase can and regularly does block customers from their btc. 
If you want convenience and control try Electrum or a phone wallet like Mycelium, Copay or breadwallet. If you don't mind the resources and want privacy and to support the bitcoin network use Bitcoin-Qt.

Probably, ya. But you're assuming a couple things.

@_date: 2016-05-06 18:42:08
Your wallet is not a single address - it is a collection of addresses. When you send money some will be returned as change to another address in your wallet. So you cannot assume that a single key/address will be kept intact as a wallet balance.
In fact, for privacy you should not try to use and re-use a single address as if a wallet since that would make all your activity less private due to associations between your transactions and the assumptions that can be drawn.

Have a look at the transaction. Note which address(es) are input and create a new transaction using the same inputs but with a higher fee. You probably can't create that transaction in the same wallet so I'd suggest exporting the private keys for the input(s) address(es) into a new Electrum wallet (it supports creating a wallet from external private keys) and then creating a transaction that sends to either where you want, or to another new HD Electrum wallet you intend to keep. If this new transaction is broadcast with higher fee and gets accepted in a block then the old transaction will be invalid and dropped by nodes.

Here is the php code I wrote for address gen. This is really old now and I don't recall if it's complete or well tested, so treat it as an example to be tested by yourself if you go that way. I seem to recall writing this for someone else as I rarely write in php nowadays. It's based off openssl library and written in C as a php extension. So I believe you can just load it and call the address gen function, give the address to users (insert in db), and then monitor the address either via Electrum ( &lt;= 1.9.8 **not* &gt;=2.0), or use a monitor script, eg. also in my github epmtd/coinwatch (as example only since not well tested).
(two separate php examples there, one using openssl as c extension, and one using phpecc library in php only, which basically just shows how an address is generated by ec pt multiply).

Too many people have woken up one day to find that Coinbase has locked their account and they will spend weeks/months/forever trying to get their btc back. That's what everyone here is warning you about, and in Bitcoin history exchanges have often and without warning gone belly up. For a small amount of btc, no big deal, but if you have substantial holdings it's recommended to get them into your own wallet where only you control the keys - then they are 100% yours (and dependent on your good security practices to keep them safe).

You can create a second partition and do that but it's a pretty technical process; even more so if you already have your drive formatted with Windows on it. It occurred to me that another cheap option is the HW1 hardware wallet. But even that is around $15 Euro or something.
You can download and install Virtualbox to create a virtual linux machine within your Windows. But technically that's not perfectly secure either, though it's probably a good bit safer than doing stuff in Windows as long as you don't connect the virtual net interface, and shred the virtual file image afterwards.
Is your system really old and cannot boot off a usb stick or some other reason why that won't work because it's really the cheapest, simplest option.

I'm part way through writing python code to suck blockchain data into sqlite3. It's currently at block 197600, so still has a ways to go. It parses data from rpc calls, removes redundancies, codifies various items to save space and inserts it as sql. It starts off quite fast but, maybe needless to say, it slows down as block size swells. 
With my current schema I expect the full data to be 6GB in sql and a much larger blob file with script and other validation data. All of the trx details, including addresses, are contained in the sql. (The external blob is to help speed the sql insertion by reducing record sizes, which has helped greatly). The address type is easily selectable for queries but as of yet I haven't done much query testing.
This is just a project of mine as I am hoping to generate some video graphics and data from the sql database after. I've tried various measures to reduce data size and speed insertion and this is about my hundredth time through but also the highest block count before tweaking something and restarting. It's doing about 1 block/sec on my i5 notebook so it'll be some time before I have full sql data, and proven code. 
Incidentally it incorporates some revalidation of data but does not check signatures. I thought later I would add a message front end and full signature verify to create an alternate full node implementation (mostly educational I guess). That's just a future idea for now.
By revalidation I mean it checks previous hash, merkle root is valid, inputs match to outputs, fee, coinbase match, coinbase has correct height, scripts are std types, ignoring non-std etc. Mostly stuff to validate my understanding of the data.
(block 198662, 1.4 blks/s, about 1.6G of sql table data, 1.9G blobs)

MHash/s is the number of "hash" computations you are doing per second. In your case about 30 million per second. That's tiny, and was small even 3 years ago, but today when the network as whole is doing

You can use openssl to do this (or any sha256 hash tool) and that is always available in all linux distributions and will never vanish. You can choose how many "rounds" of sha256 you apply and only need to remember how many you did. And you can apply salt phrases between rounds if you like.
    echo -n "12342...myphrase.. 43524" | openssl sha256 | cut -c 10-
is one round. You can put above in a loop to do more rounds,
    hash="12342...myphrase.. 43524"; for x in {1..32}; do hash=`echo -n $hash |openssl sha256 | cut -c 10-`; done; echo $hash;
where 32 is the number of rounds I chose. To add your special salt simply insert a magic code between rounds like this,
    hash="12342...myphrase.. 43524";for x in {1..32}; do hash=`echo -n "$hash mymagic" |openssl sha256 | cut -c 10-`;done;echo -n $hash;
With this readily available tool and any linux distro you can always regen keys. So eg. you can simply download [Tails]( and make a usb stick to boot offline. You don't need any special brainwallet site or program.
Having said this I do not recommend using brainwallets like this at all. Humans are just not good at making up secret phrases. Use Electrum. More flexible, safer and easier too. And also included on the latest Tails iso.

When miners don't profit some drop out, which lowers the hash rate. Every 2016 blocks the difficulty is adjusted to compensate. So as miners drop out the profitability for remaining miners increases until a balance is reached. The same operates the other way - as miners jump in and pump up the hash rate the difficulty increases until it's not profitable any more.
Only the most efficient miners remain profitable. Which is why you cannot make anything on old equipment or with high electricity costs.

I'd love it if I could buy local stuff like groceries with btc but that is probably a decade away if it ever happens. The ATM allows me to exchange btc to local cash easily and adds incentive for people here to accept pmts in btc globally and be able to use it locally. It's a step on the way to them actually knowing what btc is and have interest in using it. Otherwise, there just isn't any. The average person around here has never heard of it and has absolutely no desire to know about it. Only a few will figure out they can offer services globally, accept btc and use it locally, and this is an important step on the way to adoption.

The problem with a financial incentive is that it too easily becomes an incentive to attack the network. It's a very fine line that is open to abuse. This is the main reason why core devs do not move towards this type of node incentive. It seems simple enough on the surface to incentivize nodes but with any such incentive there is knock on effects as to how it can be abused that must be accounted for. Having a slightly negative financial incentive is not a bad thing overall.

It is possible as you can just encode any private key as BIP38 but for it to make sense you want to do this offline. 
I made a small cmd line tool for doing that and another one for generating keys from a seed. So combine them and that's it. Caveat - while my code is small and easily audited it has not been tested rigorously and could have bugs.  I only wrote this for educational purposes - to see simply the steps needed, no guarantees. 
[keyfmt]( - convert private keys in various useful ways
[rawkeys]( - generate private keys from seed (electrum 1.* type)
eg. generate 5 BIP38 keys,
    echo "1279666de665e6c662d2f45538842acd" | rawkeys 5 | keyfmt "%e - %a" testpwd
    6PRJCeeefqNZt8cGnbW32icKdEbMQNjPSgudCvfmtsETycGvfswPKysqZK - 19oLNjKeWJcHBcAmFt1eeG5HGJPP6cRA66

In this case if you know the seed you can generate the keys again, but otherwise you need to know the password.

Your coins should be fine. If you don't want to wait for your client to sync then you would have to import the private key (matching your address) into another client, or "sweep" the balance. Electrum does allow for importing keys but if you have the new version 2 then you need to use File, New to create a wallet for importing. It no longer allows importing keys into a seed based wallet (because the seed cannot restore imported keys and people get confused). However, if you import the key then you will be able to spend from it immediately and not have to wait for your other client to sync.

Ya, I was going to say that. But if you exported the key to another wallet it doesn't matter what blockchain.info says. You can use the new wallet and what matters is how many nodes are still holding the old tx and won't relay a new one. Also, depending on the tx details (outputs) you may still get away with using CPFP if it's in some miners mempool.

I wrote a bip38 cracker that does about 1 per second on an ancient Core 2 Duo laptop (using 2 cores). Using the *tongue in cheek* extrapolation method I'd guess a modern 12 core Xeon system could do about 32x faster. A supercomputer (vague term) may have 6400 of these Xeons - so lets say 32x6400, or 204,800. So at this speed you could expect a 50% chance of being cracked in 2^50 / 204800 / 2 seconds... or about 174 years. Roughly 0.5% chance per year.
hashcat supports scrypt but not specifically bip38 yet (or not publicly), so possibly using GPU farms is another option and would probably be faster.
edit: did another google check and found the new [Cheyenne supercomputer]( has 145,152 Xeon cores. So, lets say 32/12*145,152 = 387,072. About 1.89 times faster than above, or only 92 years for 50% chance of success. However, I'd suggest if it was worth using that supercomputer (maybe out of business now due to Trump) then probably they could combine resources of a dozen odd supercomputers and get down well below 1 year. Cheyenne is only  in current world rank. 
Tianhe-2 has 3,120,000 cores and SunwayTaihuLight has 10,649,600 cores (not Xeon). Maybe the Sunway can do it in (92 / (10,649,600 / 387,072)) = 3.3 years. (15,371 kW power for 3.3 years... egad!)
The number of [Top500]( supercomputers in China (167) now exceeds the USA (165) so chances are good your bip38 private key would get cracked over there.

Not just that. Most people in the world have upload speed that sucks. eg. mine is 500kbps compared to 6Mpbs down. So there's just no way I can open the port for upload increase and still maintain a usable connection. Congested upload brings even basic browser use to a crawl.
So that leaves moving the node to a VPS. And for 40GB+ space that is not a cheap deal any more. 
There needs to be way to share or shard the blockchain but still maintain verification. I've been doing some of my own dev work on this and am looking at sharding. That is, each node prunes scripts except from "block  mod N" and indicates the N so that every node can cut down size but can always find nodes for any block as long as it has IPs &gt; N (on avg).

I was being a bit humorous but also serious. It's probably hard to come up with realistic projections for how much you can make off exchange and you would be competing against ATMs and fly-by-night LBC operators. 
You could focus a lot on value added services like consulting and setup/install but I suspect even that could be hard to crack when you have high overhead costs and others may not. I only thought of coffee as there is some pro-Bitcoin coffee places like Waves in Vancouver that maybe could be explored as models. I don't know how much volume they do but having been doing it a few years it would be good to check out. And coffee may not be your thing but having something to "carry" the business when volume is slow will help - maybe other computer items or Bitcoin related devices.
Also, if you've ever been to Asia it's quite common to have very small hole-in-the-wall type currency exchanges that are basically a window to talk through. That doesn't allow for sit down consulting and services but it could reduce overhead to a minimum.

Those words are called the "seed". It is used as a starting point for generating a sequence of many private keys in your wallet.

They should have a web UI anyway. It allows them to offer a branded interface and enhance the way users interact with the node, adding value.

You can use [pywallet]( to dump the private keys that have unspent outputs. Then paste those into the "sweep keys" function of your Electrum wallet (menu Wallet, Private Keys, Sweep). That will create a tx to spend all funds on those keys into your new wallet.
That doesn't add the keys to your wallet, so any future funds received on them would not go into your new wallet. With Electrum 2.0 you can also create an Import wallet (from imported private keys) which does keep the keys intact, but it's not a seed based wallet and won't have any of the benefits of a seed.
btw always make backup copies before fiddling with wallet files etc. And of course, have backup seed word list for your electrum one too.

It's got nothing to do with people here not wanting there to be a satoshi. People here know how easy it is to sign a message with a key. Gavin claims CW did sign a message with a key but couldn't take it with him because CW didn't want the story leaked early before the "big press release". When you sign a message with a key there is a piece of text output that everyone in the world can cryptographically check on their own. He simply had to post that text which he stopped Gavin from taking home. If posted that then 90% of people here would be mostly satisfied that he has at least a decent case for being Satoshi. It would be a good start and maybe even enough for some. That signed message text is reported to have been done for Gavin and Matonis already so there is absolutely no reason it cannot simply be posted online except that is just never happened and doesn't exist. The point being that what people here want to believe about Satoshi has nothing to do with this. CW claims to have provided proof but doesn't want to show it.

It's a hack, but fairly easy to delete a trx in Electrum and then create a new one.

That depends on what program you used originally and the method it used. If it simply did a sha256 then, yes any sha256 applied to your phrase will give same output. But if that program did something different then other programs won't inherently behave the same way. SHA256 is SHA256 anywhere. But (SHA256+wackyhashvoodoo) is not SHA256. You can test right now if openssl will give you same result, and if it does then forget about some specific tool and just remember generic sha256 as your method.

In general, the only way to use brainwallets safely is to feed truly random values in rather than using phrases or human created content. There are just too many "brainwallet farms" hashing content looking for keys because the search space is so much smaller than brute forcing fully random keys.

You could have a look at my block parser linked below. It also reads blk files and can build a full working blockchain from them. It is not really standalone as it works with my MySQL db builder as a alternate method (allows building db while node is still downloading chain). The main thing is that it's pretty simple (Python) code and maybe will be more clear what it does.
The blocks are not stored in the blk files in sequence so you have to read to the end and then backtrack using previous hash from block headers until you get to the genesis block (or an already known block). And the blocks near the end (most recent) can be missing as well since they are downloaded from other nodes and some arrive before others.
This code is tested working but still does get confused sometimes when trying to parse while catching up is in progress. As is I didn't fix that yet as I would usually delete recent blocks from my sql db and run again. I've been busy on another project lately and haven't had time to finish off sqlChain (the project that uses this code).
This code can be run standalone but mainly is imported as a module in my [sqlchaind]( program. Anyway, hope it may help.

That WIF page isn't technically that explicit about string data but programmers would make assumptions about what they mean. So when they write `800C28FCA386C7A2...` and we assume it's hex representation of binary data. More correctly written with an 0x in front (as they do for single byte values in the accompanying text).
The text "80" (or 0x80 more clearly) is taken to mean one binary byte of data rather than two ASCII chars. The difference when expressed as binary is like this:
    0x80 = 10000000 (2 hex digits as 8 bits, 1 byte)
    80 (ascii) = 0x3830 = 00111000 00110000 (4 hex digits, 2 bytes, 16 bits)
When you hash data each way you get differing results. All hash library functions work on binary data so feeding it ascii text gets hashed incorrectly.

UTXOs are unspent outputs. Those are the outputs you have not spent and sum up to the balance in your wallet. So globally they represent the btc that can be used to create new txs on the network. It's important because this is the data the bitcoin client keeps in memory and scans on each new block to check new txs against. It's kind of  "state" data for the network.

BIP148 operates on the premise that the network is run by users not just miners. If miners choose to create blocks not accepted by users then that's ok - UASF nodes aren't concerned because they aren't accepted or relayed anyway. As long as some miners are mining for BIP148 then it works, even if maybe slowly at first. BIP148 succeeds if miners find they cannot relay their blocks, and hence they are worthless, so they switch, or if to avoid that outcome they start mining SegWit blocks before BIP148 activates anyway. SegWit2x is an effort to concede to BIP148 but lock in a hard fork for later. That hard fork will depend on how many users are running btc1 software in a few months vs. how many simply just accept SegWit blocks. Or, at least that's my take on it atm.

Separating the wallet server from the front end web site is a good idea - that is, as long as your wallet server is harder to get into than the web site. But the best option, if you do not require automated sending of pmts from the server is using a master public key. 
The most common example of that is using an Electrum wallet, which is "deterministic". This just means that the key pairs are generated algorithmically from a seed value. This seed value is the critical info and is kept offline, usually written on paper as 12 words, or perhaps as well, on a flash stick which is used to sign payments offline. But many/most wallets now available use deterministic or "HD" methodology so there are options other than Electrum. It just happens to be the oldest.
Electrum provides a menu item for exporting the "Master Public Key" (MPK). This key can be used to generate unlimited addresses using a fairly simple algorithm (EC pt multiply). This code is placed on the web server to create new addresses to receive funds into. But any hacker getting in cannot access or create private keys and so cannot spend from your wallet. The best they can do is see all your addresses (current and future, until you change the MPK).
Since Electrum is written in python the merchant/server code tends to be python scripts but there is no reason they can't be done in php or other languages. I think I have a php script kicking around I wrote to do address generation, but I'd have to go check. A typical approach is to create addresses and attach them to user accounts so they can deposit. Then have some code which monitors the addresses for incoming payments. Or, use Electrum running (watch only) on another system and trigger payment actions from that. How you do this would depend on what your needs are but it could be lightweight (meaning it doesn't need a full blockchain and bitcoind daemon running), or it could use bitcoind to monitor new blocks and scan them for payments to the address database. I think the Electrum code on github has a few example scripts for server use.

Who knows. Maybe not. If it's real trading amongst Chinese then I'd say that's legit but significant only to the extent that it is relayed to outside exchanges (unless you're Chinese, in which case it's pretty significant to you). I think when a market/exchange becomes divorced from the others, historically (eg. MtGox), we've seen bad things happen because the price difference always means something. Right now I'd guess it's a combination of difficulty of exchanging Yuan and perhaps somewhat nebulous volume numbers.

You may find some of my code in my misc github useful. This bit of C code is derived from vanitygen (keyconv)  and uses openssl. It generates addresses from an MPK so it's not exactly what you need but it shows how you could use similar code to make a fast tool to generate addresses from private keys.
And then there is a tool that does what you need but is also in Python and so may not be faster than what you have. 
There's probably other ones out there already. I could write a faster C version but it would cost a small amount for my time. 
I think you can just use keyconv from vanitygen to do what you need, or adapt the code easily.
Getting address from private key is 2 steps - 1. pt multiply 2. convert/encode

Both are essentially random numbers. But they are used in different ways.
A seed is used to generate a series of private keys using an algorithm (step by step repeatable process). So in that case the keys are not random but "determined" by the seed and processing steps. Hence, why those wallets are called "deterministic". 
Either way, you end up with private keys (random or deterministic) which is the math basis for how your btc are secured. 
12 or 24 word typically just determines the length of the seed, 12 being 128 bit and 24 being 256 bit (which just happens to be the same length as a private key). Seeds, though random, for ease of use are usually encoded as word lists making them easier to handle, say over the phone, or remember. In this common case each 3 words represents 32 bits of the seed, a nice chunk for most processors to work with.
Now, as for what to do with Tails. Assuming you want to use Electrum you would fire that up and create a new wallet. Write down the seed words securely, redundantly because that's how you will recover the wallet later. Then in Electrum copy one address, the first if you like, and paste that into Circle as your "send to" address. That will send the btc to your Electrum wallet.
As a bonus you can save/export the Electrum MPK (menu item Wallet, Master Public Keys) from your wallet if you want to "watch only" your wallet on your desktop system. Optionally creating a second Electrum wallet using this MPK will give you the ability to watch and create new addresses without being able to spend the btc from that wallet.
But be aware if privacy is critical then having a "watch only" wallet, though safe from hacking, will leave traces of your addresses in servers that may be linked to your IP if you aren't using Tails.
Most important point to take away - keep your 12 seed words safe and private because those are how you can restore your wallet any time, any where later.

You can use a wallet like Electrum that depends on someone else running a node doing the validation. There are already Electrum servers supporting BIP148 but in some cases you could be using a wallet where the choice of chain is out of your hands.  So the UASF mantra is that by running your own node you have control over what chain you support and as always with running your own node you don't depend on some other server / company to validate your btc.

It doesn't matter if a key/address pair has been used or not. It can be used again. (Maybe I'm being a bit too general when I say that. Spending from an address exposes it's public key and makes it just slightly more at risk compared to one not spent from.)
The blockchain is a ledger of transactions. It does not manage key/address pairs. No one does that except individual key owners for their own use. This is part of what makes bitcoin decentralized - there is no central address registry and one isn't needed. 
Only probability secures keys.
A key/address pair is not like a bank account. Anyone can create them and need not tell anyone else. Of course, it doesn't help much to have an address that no one knows about.

Being another node in the network means that you also act in the relay consensus that keeps Bitcoin operating correctly. By following valid rules you help make the network more resistant to attack.
You can verify your own transactions if you use a wallet that depends on core. eg. bitcoin-qt, armory

According to the SegWit user guide if your btc are in cold staorage you may eventually want to move them to a SegWit address.

t2.small with 2GB is enough but not ideal (will take a long time to sync, but you could sync to EBS on a larger instance and attach to a small one). And it's only the beginning of your costs. Add storage space of ~120 GB plus **bandwidth**, which is the real killer on AWS.
Also, don't bother with Windows. You'd be much better to run an Ubuntu instance and use spot instances (a fraction of on demand charges, &lt; $0.01/hr.)  to get base cost down. But bandwidth will still make almost any other VPS option cheaper. 
Assuming you have some need for a remote full node I'd suggest Vultr.com as they accept BTC, have simpler instance controls, free bandwith (limited), and charged per hour so you don't commit to full months just like AWS. Also, they've been giving away free block storage that helps with cutting that cost.
($10 : 2 CPU, 40 GB SSD) + ($10 : 100 GB block storage) or ($20 : 4 CPU, 60 GB SSD) + 50GB free block storage (if deal still offered). Either 2TB or 3TB bandwidth included. I've used them for full nodes for development and you can start/stop as needed so cut costs to small fraction if need be.
edit: You don't need to learn much Linux to run a full node. eg. start node, add PPA for access to bitcoin repo, apt-get update and apt-get install bitcoind. And you're going. There are plenty of tutorials kicking around for that.

Ok. I hadn't done this for a couple years so wanted to test it before posting. It worked for me. 
Replace the &lt;user&gt; in the path with suitable user name or if the wallet file is located elsewhere then just replace the whole path. Change file name from test1 as you need.
You can either put this in a file (if you need to run it again later) and run it with python eg. `python set_gap_limit.py` or just type `python` at the cmd line in linux to start a python console and then copy/paste it or type manually. 
The python console is handy for testing out quick bits of code and that's how I tested this works. If in the console then type `quit()` after to exit.
     python
    
    from electrum import WalletStorage
    storage = WalletStorage("/home/&lt;user&gt;/.electrum/wallets/test1")
    storage.put('gap_limit',25)
    storage.write()
You can write electrum scripts in a similar way to do many other things. There are some example scripts in the electrum github scripts directory. They seem like they may be a bit dated but could help with how to do some things. The best guide is probably reading the actual electrum source code to see how they do things and then mimic that.

Watch only wallet can only create unsigned txs. Without the seed / private keys it mathematically cannot do more. Unsigned txs need to be copied to and signed on a system that does have the seed /private keys. However, to use a watch-only wallet correctly you need to create the seed (master) wallet on a truly offline system (one that will never again be connected) and copy only the xpub (mpk) over to the online system for creating the watch-only wallet. If you had or have the seed wallet on the online system then you have already compromised it to the extent that you have no idea what may already be lurking on that system.

That doesn't help because any thief could also monitor the mempool for your higher fee and then issue a trx with an even higher one. How high a fee is a thief willing to pay to trump the victim? You end up in a ~10 minute race to determine who is willing to give away more to keep the funds.

Well, for starters posting on reddit doesn't announce your IP address to anyone except those with access to server logs at reddit. And you don't open a port on your system and listen to incoming connections from reddit users. You aren't inherently vulnerable to any 0-day bugs in bitcoin core by posting on reddit. Any hacker who writes a script to mimic being a bitcoin node and capturing IP addresses then has a list of targets for attacking other open ports on your system, eg. next month when you open a port for Teamviewer etc.
I'm not saying it's a big risk, but it's nothing at all like posting on reddit.

You can use Electrum for this quite easily but will need to use the console interface for some things. You can generate many addresses, export them to a database for your merchant handling (like assigning to user accounts), or script it. The wallet will always show the total balance across all addresses and the trx history but you can also inspect each address on the address tab. Integration probably means some level of console scripting and there is also a few Electrum based python merchant scripts around. I know I wrote one years ago but it's probably pretty dated now as it works with Electrum v.1 wallets. 
If you send from Electrum it will use whatever addresses it needs to source funds going out but you can also have manual control over that by selecting addresses on the address tab and then right clicking and choosing "send from". There are a few more control options and also from the console you can script various ways to manage what it uses as send inputs.

Would it be helpful if core bitcoin had an option to only send new transactions via Tor connections but allowed all other traffic over open connections? In this way any attacker could never tell if a transaction originated from a node as more nodes would handle new transactions via Tor, but without burdening the entire traffic over Tor. Sort of a form of plausible deniability.

No, you just use a burn address. There are scripts around (and I wrote one) that will take a phrase you make and complete it to be a valid address with no private key (because you would have to brute force to find the key). As an example if I input the phrase "1burnmyassonmarstonight" into my [supernova]( script then it gives me back this address with no known private key:
(btc sent here are lost)
So if people voted on a phrase to use then you could generate a burn address. To fake that you would need to use something like vanitygen to find a matching key and that would take too long. Even 6-7 letter prefixes take a very long time so doing one with around 20 chars would take much too long even on a large bank of GPUs.

There are multiple factors. Part of it is risk aversion, so the price difference represents risk. It takes time to move fiat out of China and buy BTC, and while holding Yuan you are at risk of market changes. You may be paying a premium for conversion back to a currency to re-buy BTC. If the CNYBTC price moves against you while holding BTC then you can be at a loss even if only a few minutes. When the market has higher volatility traders will calculate that into the spread they need before doing a trade. Maybe they can hold an option to balance that but I don't know if BTC traders are that sophisticated, or at least the ones involved in what is probably black market capital flows, or if these operations are automated yet.

If the address is not one from your "original" wallet then that probably means it's someone else's address and somehow they hacked yours and transferred btc to theirs.
If you create a wallet with an address, eg. the one you traced to, then yes, it will create a watch-only wallet. That wallet is watching an address you don't control and cannot spend from.
You want to restore the wallet from seed or from an old wallet file and then check the balance. If it not what you expect then I think unfortunately that means you somehow got hacked and stolen from. Unless there is some other aspect of this you haven't explained, like you have another wallet you were also using.
You'll want to figure out what went wrong. If you left your seed or password laying around or somewhere on the computer then it is very vulnerable. Anyone getting the seed can steal your coins. But with the password they also need the wallet file to steal the coins.
@_date: 2016-05-07 02:46:15
In that case it sounds like you need to find the wallet that has this address in it. You won't be able to spend unless you have the seed for the wallet that contains this address, or alternately the correct wallet file with matching password. 
A watch-only wallet cannot send btc but can be used to create a transaction for another wallet that does have it's seed still.
@_date: 2016-05-12 03:54:24
I wonder why the new one is invalid? Is there something unusual with the inputs - like is an input used already in a previous tx? ie. it is already spent in some other tx that is accepted. Also, how is it (or you) checking whether valid - using a block explorer? It is possible for a block explorer to say it's invalid but still have it accepted in a block by a miner because the explorer may be seeing the first one. But if you have created an invalid new tx then I'd think that means something is wrong with an input. I'm surprised Electrum would have created an invalid tx. Anyway, sounds confusing.

IDK but a few things come to mind. Who benefits? It must have been costly as it wasn't worth keeping up to deflect suspicions. Who could have recouped some of the costs by co-ordinating with miners? That is, it costs nothing in fees if you're collecting a large portion of them and actually could make money if it pushes average fees up. Probably collecting higher fees wasn't the goal but aligning interests.

If you want to use bitcoin core then you can enable pruning mode so it doesn't need so much disk space. If your btc are only sitting on a few addresses then I'd suggest installing Electrum, create a new wallet and safely write down the seed words. Then import the private key of each address in your core wallet using the sweep method (menu: Wallet, Private Keys, Sweep). Copy/Paste each key in that window and it will create a tx that sends all btc on them to your new wallet (without needing any re-sync). It's been years since I used core but I think there must still be a way to show (copy/paste) your private keys without full sync. 
If it's considerable value I'd suggest doing this all on a disconnected system. If sync time and big downloads are an issue you'll be much happier with Electrum. If you need max security then look into offline signing or get a hardware wallet.

Of course, but the likelihood of that is what causes "those people" to sell their debt onwards.

The more Trump talks about just printing away the debt and the more likely he gets elected and could actually do that (which I doubt since talking crazy doesn't mean doing crazy), well, the more debt holders start to sell. 
But Trump has realized he can talk as crazy as he likes and gain favour because half the nimrods out there haven't a clue anyway, and they could actually think it's all that easy and vote for him, and the other half just don't believe him.

Not an enhanced block explorer like blockchain.info. I'm thinking more like a simple interface over rpc calls. So it could do most of that in client js code but basic rpc can look up blocks, trxs etc. Formatting, trx linkages and layout can be done in browser, so really it could offer a json api barely wrapping rpc with very little overhead. I don't know if someone has already created an open source layer like that but I suspect unit sales wouldn't support that work as commercially worthwhile (so it's just an idea).

LocalBitcoins.com has worked well for me several times. Sell btc directly to PP, but do be very sure to only deal with a buyer who has a long history of positive feedback. I usually look for 1000+ ~100% feedback, and shorter payment windows (time, which may hold up your btc until transfer is done). For that you probably need to accept a price at or slightly below market and typically will lose ~3% to PP fees. There are buyers offering higher prices with less feedback and that indicates a higher risk that they could later force a PP refund (your main risk in this process).
edit: If going this route I would break your amount into smaller portions, eg. &lt; $200 and make a few smaller deals rather than one big one. For me that spreads the risk and makes it less attractive to scamming. It allows you to test out a specific buyer, build some trust and not have the whole amount in jeopardy with one deal.

I read they were going with a "master IP list" of nodes that have full chain, but I'd rather see a distributed sharding approach where everyone chooses how much they can offer.

If you mean address not public key, then you're basically asking for the UTXO set and that is currently about 2GB. Maybe it could be somewhat less if you compacted multiple outputs for an address. 
If you actually meant public key then that would be the outputs for an address which has previously had a spend because we don't know the public key otherwise. That would be some fraction of the UTXO set above and it could be queried on that db but I don't know how big it would be.
edit: but re-reading your question and I see you want values over time, which obviously would be much more info and a much larger file. It would be approaching roughly 20-25% the full blockchain data size if you wanted that full level of detail because you can throw away the witness data but need most of the rest.

Pruning allows only storing recent blocks and can run with as little as ~500MB plus the utxo set (last I heard, ~2GB). Obviously this isn't useful for providing old blocks to the network but you can run a wallet. You cannot run an Electrum server as it needs the whole history.

Selling btc for Paypal is always risky by it's nature. You're basically being asked to trust the buyer and there's probably few people out there you'd want to do that with. So the best case is to find one with a long history of not screwing others and hope that continues. There are other ways than Paypal available on LBC like WU or Moneygram but generally with higher fees and less convenience. But yes, even LBC warns outright that Paypal is risky.

I tried looking at the commit for nLocktime but it says 220 files changed and 59k lines. I'm guessing it somehow pulled in the whole repo as a change as I'm sure it isn't really that many changes.

That's right but most wallets now are HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) which means all the keys are generated from a single seed using an algorithm. This allows the whole "database" of keys to be generated as needed at any time and ensures the same sequence of keys will result. So rather than storing and backing up all the keys you can store just the seed and recover all the keys from that.
On bitaddress.org I think the initial wait is for collecting entropy for a random seed that the random number generator will use for subsequent keys.
@_date: 2016-05-07 14:52:05
I think you are right but there is a counter argument. Miners are currently selling less coins than they mine because they just pay expenses - some percent of total mined, let's say 50% because electricity cost is half current price. After halving they still need to sell same amount of btc if price is the same to cover same costs. So they sell more percent of their mined coins, lets say near 100% but keep mining in hopes price will rise to offset. 
I think in this scenario, which is obviously not all or none miners, it takes much longer for the price to reflect the lack of supply. Eventually though some drop out, and price does move. I suspect this is why after Nov 2012 halving it tooks months to be felt. Early 2013 was "blamed" on Cypress but I don't think Cypress was important at all. More likely the effects of the miners economics, ASIC intro, and halving of new supply, but the media always goes for the most visible thing they can point at because, well, everything always needs to be obvious in the news.
So look for an event in the news to pin the coming rise on roughly a few months after the halving. I will be, and shaking my head the media got it wrong yet again.

Install tor on your system (or use Tails). 
Start electrum and go to network settings. Choose Proxy type as SOCKS5 and set local tor location, typically "localhost:9050". 
You'll have to manually enter the server onion address as they don't get discovered like normal addresses. There have been a few usually posted on the [bitcointalk.org]( Electrum sub-forum. They seem to have a tendency to be up and down.
If you want to make sure no data is leaked then you should probably set the network settings while disconnected so that your addresses don't get sent to a normal server before tor gets active, or do from a Tails install which prevents non-tor connections.

Hardware is the least of his worries. Sounds like he didn't realize it's very easy to intercept and provide fake Electrum code (it's python, non-compiled code for one thing), and if that was the case he'd certainly have intercepted the signature file as well. Not having full control over the internet access is just as faulty as not controlling the hardware - even more so as it's so easy to control the net when you control the  location of the meeting place. But I'm positive Gavin would know this. He either thought it was too unlikely, which is very poor judgement, or he had some vested interest in playing along.

A seed is different from a private key. I presume Jaxx is a deterministic wallet but I may be mistaken. A seed is usually expressed as a sequence of 12 or more words and is used to generate all the private keys making up a wallet. You'll be given it once when you create the wallet and told to write the words down. 
edit... I did a quick google of jaxx and read their FAQ. It is a deterministic wallet and what they call your "backup phrase" is your seed. It is used to generate all the keys in your wallet. However, the FAQ made no mention of what standards it follows, if any, such as BIP39 etc. So it may not be compatible with other wallets. That would mean you are dependent on Jaxx for any post-split chain behavior, and also in case their company shuts down may have limited options. I just don't know more about the wallet so you should probably ask their support or read more on a Jaxx specific forum.

It just in itself doesn't provide the exit ramp that Bitpay does and so doesn't obsolete them unless they refuse to integrate and deal with LN when it has become big. They can play with LN too. Maybe they'll have a harder time competing with small nodes but that's not a sure thing. And they aren't alone - sure, banks can integrate LN and offer services.

To do arbitrage you would buy on other exchanges, raising the price there, and sell on Gox, lowering it there. How long are you going to do that without being able to get your fiat currency out? Not long. There was a significant premium on Gox (~$100) indicating that people were not willing to do arbitrage because they knew they couldn't withdraw. 
China led that whole bubble and people buying on Gox (selling in China) pushed Gox higher. For many that was the only way they could get their money out, so they bought at a premium, rather than wait months (or never) to withdraw fiat. Only the naive sold on Gox thinking they'd get their fiat, or would buy back lower. But, ahem, then one day you couldn't even get btc out of Gox.

Not really. Is it better if one server knows your IP or many random ones? I'm not sure there's much of a case for either. Maybe it depends on your tx volume.

A fork happens because nodes on the network are using different rules for the validation and relay of txs (and blocks). So choosing which fork you are "on" depends on what node you use for broadcasting txs. If you run your own node you make specific choices about what software you download and run. 
If you are using a service like Coinbase, then they choose what software and hence what fork txs will be on. 
If you choose a light wallet like Electrum then the fork you use depends on what server you connect with and broadcast txs on. 
Core devs and other devs can create software and set the rules, and others could modify them if they have the tech skills, but it's up to users (including miners but only as a small subset) who decide what to actually run that makes up the network.
When most users are running the same rules then the network doesn't fork (or only has one fork you might say). Users who try to run different rules end up being off the network because their txs are not relayed. When significant portions of the network run different rules then you have a fork - there isn't a group that says you must run X or Y rules but rather it's a battle for mind share in convincing users what to run. Hence, the ongoing battle as users try to create some consensus.
I don't know if that helps or makes it worse. I may not have been terribly clear or exact in terminology.
When you send a tx after the any fork occurs then you are deciding which node to broadcast on and your tx may or may not be accepted by one or both of the forks (ie. nodes may relay or not depending on compatibility). If there is a clear distinction, eg. RBF is supported on one fork and not the other (unlikely) then your tx will get accepted on one fork and not the other. But if the tx is very generic and only spends pre-fork btc then it could be accepted on both forks, in a sense spending it twice and known as a replay attack. You spent on one fork but it was "replayed" on the other.
On the whole the result could be pretty confusing and you're probably best to avoid txs during the time of uncertainty.
Core makes announcements on  and  and can also be followed in other places like IRC or  Anything happening will show up very quickly here as well.

In the white paper the nodes are the miners. Originally in Bitcoin code satoshi wrote every node had mining code and mined. Bitcoin diverted from that almost 2 years later when pools were introduced splitting the network into two classes. Nodes do determine the network and miners are dependent on the network for relay and acceptance by nodes. But today it's probably more likely the exchanges determine which blocks are going to have value. This whole thing is now staged for a major clusterfuck. I am 99.9% on the sidelines while this is sorted out and I'll only be buying back in on the segwit core chain because it actually has a future I can support.

My recollection of how blockchain.info works (which may have changed) is that your seed/keys are encrypted in your browser and the encrypted data is stored on their server. They have no access to your keys but you depend on them to provide the data back to your browser when accessed. You can also backup that data on your system and probably print out the seed or keys as you wish, or import to another wallet. So the answer is **you** have custody but only in an independent way if you backup the wallet data such that you're not dependent on their servers.

Without a txid we can only guess. Are you confused by the "change" part of a trx? A trx input cannot be split so it often will look like a larger amount is being spent but with a "change" output being sent back to another address in your wallet. Much like how you cannot tear a $100 bill in half to spend $65. You give them $100 and get a $35 back as change. 
Or maybe you made a mistake with units, eg. mBTC instead of uBTC or "bits" etc.

They will buy for about 3% below market and the bank network takes 35 baht (~$1) in fees. So, I worked out, &lt;7600 baht the second method is cheaper, and above that the first.

For Electrum 1.9.8 there are some utilities around that allow extracting keys from a seed. I [wrote a couple]( and I'm sure I've seen some others.
The same, in principle, applies for Electrum 2.0+ and Mycelium but I haven't seen example code for that yet, nor written any. The algorithm is somewhat more complicated and I haven't had time to dig in yet. Of course, both are fully viewable on their github pages and it's just a matter of taking some of that code and wrapping it in a simple utility.
Once you have generated keys from the seed you can import the keys into other wallets and use them to sign transactions. That *can* be done offline under the right conditions (need details of inputs for the signing which most watch only clients will codify for offline signing), and then take the signed transaction to the web for safe broadcast. It's easiest to do with the original wallet software but can been done manually with more difficulty and expertise.

In theory breadwallet is BIP39 compatible. That means even if you don't like how they support different forks after Aug 1st you should be able to take your seed words elsewhere and restore on other software. 
However, the best wallet for more advanced uses like that is Electrum and though it does support BIP39 it reportedly does not work with breadwallet due to the latter not using BIP44. It may end up being more complicated for you if you seek alternative ways to access your btc or take steps to ensure they work on multiple chains.

Bitcoin uses [Elliptic Curve]( math. I'm not a mathematician but as far as I know there is no connection to Fractal math. Elliptic curve math makes heavy use of the modulus (mod) function with very large numbers, which is kind of like "clock" math. There are some good videos on youtube that explain some of this in laymans terms. Just search for "Bitcoin 101".

That's nothing to do with it being deterministic but with who owns the private for the address. You can also safely receive returned btc on a core wallet, or any wallet for which you do own (control) the private key (regardless of whether it's deterministic).

That's a bit confusing. If a tx isn't shown using the coins then they must be there still. You may not be seeing them in your own wallet due to some local issue. If the btc show on a block explorer then they are there but you'll need to resolve your wallet problem to see them. 
Also, if you import the private key (or just address) into electrum you should get a full history of the btc on that address (as long as the sync does complete, try different servers if it doesn't seem to get sync'd).

I just noticed you are using the Wallet class. In my code above I do not do that. I just use WalletStorage. I have no idea if that's the problem.

I'm not aware of a site that has that info but it could be done. The most compact form of storing an address in binary is 20 bytes. So if you know the UTXO address count for each block and multiply by 20 that would be the smallest size. Even compression would net little gain (~10%) as the address bits are very random. Finding a site that lists address count for each block may be possible but I haven't see one. You could write a script that runs on a full node that would generate this data for you. It's just I've not seen anyone presenting that info on a site.

As far as Electrum you would choose "SOCKS5" proxy in server settings. Not SOCKS4 because it doesn't support UDP protocol, which means that DNS lookups cannot go through Tor. Ideally you would locate an onion address for an Electrum server and enter that. They have a tendency to come and go. You can use a regular server but that implies your traffic using an "exit node" to connect to the non-onion server. Be sure you select ssl or https mode so data is encrypted. Besides that you need to run Tor on your system or one you trust in your network. 
If you want to be very sure then finally you would use a traffic sniffer like wireshark to view traffic and note any traffic not going through Tor.
The simplest solution is likely to create a [Tails]( usb stick (explained on their site) and boot on that when you need privacy. It has Electrum pre-installed and ensures by default all traffic only goes out through Tor.

16a5... is a "change" address, as in you get change at the cash register when you pay with a $10 bill.
With Bitcoin you cannot partially spend an output from a previous receipt - it has to be fully spent and then change (left over) sent back to you. So that address 16a5... you will see in your wallet is also owned by you and created automatically for accepting the change. When you send money later it will be spent fully as well and another change address created.

All they have to do is broadcast "withdraw" txs on both chains (assuming they haven't broken the btc by moving internally on one chain) - then it's up to users to retrieve BCH using a suitable wallet. It's not foolproof because some users would probably withdraw to a third party address.

If it says "watch-only", that means you imported the address ( 1xyz... ) not the private key ( 5xyz... ). You cannot spend using the address. You need the private key. You will need to get the private key from your other client and use it when you create the new wallet in Electrum. I don't recall off hand how you export the private key from "bitcoin core" but I'm sure there is a menu item or something.

There is no single Electrum server. There are many and run by volunteers by installing open source software on top of a bitcoin node. You can run your own if you have time to set it up. In the past some nodes have been available on Tor as hidden servers. But to use a Tor server you would have to configure your system with Tor and tell Electrum to connect via socks proxy in the settings. 
The simplest approach to using Tor w/Electrum is probably to make a [Tails]( boot usb stick and boot on that when you need privacy. It now has Electrum pre-installed.
Since Electrum supports socks proxies you can connect Electrum using other proxy type arrangements. One very simple way is to start an ssh dynamic tunnel (easy on linux or using putty on windows) to a server and then tell Electrum to connect via that port. So one thing that occurred to me was using a pay-by-hour VPS provider that accepts btc to temporarily open a socks proxy. 
eg. bitnodes.io - Looking at their info it seems you can start a server and pay after, which means you could maybe request a server, get an IP, start ssh, connect Electrum via tunnel, make payments and disconnect within minutes... I haven't tried it yet.

I'm not an Airbitz user so can't help with the user interface but there must be a way to see your wallet balance as a whole rather than individual keys making up the wallet.
It looks like you sent 0.18 usd to yourself and 1.54 usd was returned to a new address in your wallet as change. Of course, if the 0.18 usd was to yourself the total wallet balance should only change by whatever fee was paid, which in this case seems to be zero.
@_date: 2017-07-10 06:06:30
Don't follow that method as it is not secure. You can do offline electrum on usb stick but seek out a better tutorial for creating a **bootable** usb stick first.
@_date: 2017-07-07 22:18:09
You can use a raspberry pi as many do. It's cheap and has secondary uses like as a media center. Then your offline system becomes actually just an uSD card with the OS on it that you simply swap and boot for bitcoin use. Since you're moderately techy you shouldn't have much problem creating a boot sd card suitable for running Electrum. It's practically speaking as good as a hardware wallet but not as convenient or simple.
You can do the same with a normal laptop (OS on bootable usb stick) and the only trust you really require is that your laptop BIOS isn't compromised. Tails OS is used by many for this purpose as it already has Electrum included in the usb boot image and is generally trusted.

That's a nice clear explanation of creating a locktime transaction. My only comment would be you don't explain the mechanism or reasoning behind the sequence number vs locktime.
From my modest reading of that you have to reduce the sequence but it need not be zero. It was meant as a method for bypassing the locktime if need be (assuming you have the key still), but if the client won't broadcast a locktime tx before it's time then the sequence number becomes only useful as a last moment cancel function before the tx is accepted into a block. Does that still work?
Also, I believe the locktime can be a time value instead of a block height (when greater than 500e6) unless that ability was removed at some point.
Still a nice step by step of working with raw txs.

I think it should work fine. I only mentioned it because being different from code I posted and tested here.
For reading writing the wallet file you only need WalletStorage. If you want to use some other wallet functions then you probably need the Wallet class. I'm not aware of any detailed docs on using the class. The best bet is looking at how it's used in the Electrum source code and using it the same way. If you want to PM me some example code you're using I can try and look for errors or test it here.

I had a browse in that code and this is the significant part that creates the key from phrase,
    var hash = Crypto.SHA256($(' { asBytes: true });
So that is simply one round of sha256. The rest is standard Bitcoin / ECDSA ops. The only thing to be aware of is that there are compressed and uncompressed keys. Each is different and not compatible with each other. So each has a different key/address pair. You would need to use the same choice again later, or try each and go with the one that has funds.

Select address in list, right click and choose Sign/Verify Message. Enter message, click sign.
You can also access from Tools menu but note in either case the address needs to be one which you have the private key for so this won't work in a watch only wallet.

And that balance is wrong? If wrong, then there must be some tx making it wrong, or different from what you expect, or what it was before your recent activity. What I mean is either it has an expected balance or it's not - because of a tx making it incorrect.
@_date: 2017-07-16 15:31:25
It probably just had a low fee. Unconfirmed txs eventually get dropped if they don't confirm. It takes quite a while - last I heard it was around 2 weeks before that happens. Anyway, if dropped then it just means the tx never happened but you may need to contact your exchange's support if it doesn't show up back in your wallet. 
Most likely it's just slow and will confirm before too long.
@_date: 2017-07-12 01:48:52
As far as spoiling your wallet a tx with 4 inputs is not terribly bad. I've had some with 3 or 4 inputs. A spoiled wallet to me would be one with dozens/hundreds of very low value outputs. 
Basically what happens is your wallet looks at what unspent outputs are in your wallet and then tries to choose the least number that sums up to enough to cover your spend. Each output it uses typically needs around 225 bytes for data. So if you think you have 1 or 2 small output values in your wallet you can try reducing your total spend in steps until the fee drops significantly. That would indicate that it has dropped one unspent output and saved you about 1/4 of the fee. 
Eventually you may still want to spend that output but it's entirely possible it's too small and not worth spending because the fee is higher than the output value. eg. you visited a faucet and received a 10 cent pmt that is now costing $1 to spend.

What you call a recovery phrase is the same as the seed and is used as a generator for key/address pairs in the wallet. It can be used on multiple clients of the same software. If it is BIP39 compatible then it can also be used on multiple clients of differing but compatible software. eg. Mycelium, Copay and Electrum all can restore a BIP39 seed. Electrum can not create a BIP39 seed but can restore one. So if you want the compatibility of a BIP39 seed on Electrum then you would need to create the wallet on eg. Mycelium and then restore it on Electrum. 
This is a result of a historical oddity that the creator of Electrum didn't agree with BIP39 details being the best choice but decided it should be able to read them.

From a physical redundancy perspective that is true. But from a "political" node angle such a node protects the network as well as any other, and better than one with port disabled and not actively seeding blocks. 
Most people are running nodes to ensure the network stays true (according to current rules) I think the physical redundancy aspect is the less significant. Acting as attack deterrence isn't lessened by being on a cloud unless you're worried about hosting providers (or hackers) infiltrating and corrupting their customer's nodes policies.

A [Casascius coin]( is probably closest to want you desire but not likely to be accepted by most vendors. You can carry a private key as qr code (eg. paperwallet), used to sign a trx, but there are two problems with that.
1. It's totally insecure as you have your key with you and need to expose it to spend.
2. Most vendors won't have a system in place that scans keys and spends from them (and returns change to the same address).
If you could get around  then maybe you could carry a bundle of small denomination paper wallets (eg. 0.01 btc each) and hand over a few to pay, discarding after, and not worrying about change. But it really is more hassle than vendors are likely to bother with.

20475 btc contracts at 477.28 = 9772308 USD. Presumably those btc were sold at some lower price and then forced buy at this price. No info here about what price they were short sold at but if $2 million was lost then expected price of short sell was, ($9772308-$2000000)/20475 = $379 - which seems unlikely to me.

SegWit is some changes to internal block structure to make blocks more efficient, changes in how block size is measured to go with that, plus a fix for malleability. It's this fix that is wanted by many because it enables (efficient) 2nd layer enhancements on top of Bitcoin. SegWit itself has been well tested for almost 2 years on testnet, and also on other coins. But it was always planned as a soft fork by Core devs because that is a safer and more gradual shift. SegWit2x is a quick mash up of that plus code to force block size increase using a hard fork. It hasn't been well tested and the hard fork is considered dangerous by many. 
Many users wants SegWit. Some users want bigger blocks. SegWit2x is an attempt to tie big blocks to SegWit as a bundle deal. Kind of like how your cable company ties crap channels to the one you actually want as an excuse for it costing 2x as much.

Well, that's fantasy. Going around buying up companies and forming an industry alliance to force a central authority on Bitcoin is not at all the same "as providing an alternative that anyone can accept or not". It's just typical industry based coercion; the same you see in Washington lobby groups and large medical and pharma companies. The industry may end with it's own "basketball court" but anyone who actually values a decentralized Bitcoin will route around this corruption and/or move elsewhere. If Bitcoin is corrupted into being another Paypal the value of it's "tokens" will reflect that. And those who value an actually decentralized currency will build a new one with fixes based on this experience, ie. change the POW.

I posted a link up thread that is a listing of servers and their signaling intent. The only thing you trust them for is to not keep IP logs. They shouldn't but you cannot really know. As far as tx data it can be checked by electrum that the headers match so you should not be lead astray.
As for choosing I've long used electrum.no-ip.org just because it's been around a long time and the owner happens to post on here regularly. Whatever that is worth, probably not so much but I figure better than one that started last week.
Most servers also post a blurb on the console tab that often mentions any policies.

It's very unlikely a POW change would work for Bitcoin but it could be a new coin, that many core devs get behind and support, that forks off Bitcoin (so that every btc holder has a stake and incentive to get behind). ie. it could start initially as co-existing and if it gets dev talent and future development it can be more attractive than Bitcoin. I know it's just an alt coin. It's success mostly depends on who gets behind it and their commitment for Bitcoin to continue to be free. I've had zero interest in any alt coins to date but in the current landscape with the right players I'd get behind this.

F*ck that. If btc1 becomes the new client and the core devs aren't involved with it's development then there will not be any "lick wounds and fight another battle". The core devs are going to work on the fork that they believe in (or quit) because that is what they do, and all along they haven't been working on it just for employment. That will mean another chain anyway. If there's anything we should learn from this it's that a POW algorithm that cannot be usurped by a single company is essential to decentralized control. I read that white paper on [cuckoo]( and it seems like a great choice. I'd like to see more research on memory bound algorithms by some of the real smart core guys.

This is absolutely the wrong way to use Electrum offline. You can do it this way but the security model is the same as if you had it on your online system and you gain no benefit.
To correctly use Electrum offline you need to create a bootable usb stick with an OS like Tails, Ubuntu or other linux distro and install Electrum to that. Then you need to disconnect and reboot on to that OS to create your wallet, copy the master public key (xpub) to your normal online system for creating a watch-only online wallet. 
The Electrum offline usb stick must never be able to access the internet again on any subsequent boot up and ideally not be able to mount existing  disks. There are more full tutorials on this and I have only given a limited description. He is right in that you can do it in 30 minutes for the same low cost but please do it the right way for your own safety.

You won't receive any new btc. If a splits happens there will be 2 chains. You can choose to spend your btc on each chain separately but will need to be careful you do it the right way with the right software. That's why people are saying to just hold it and wait and see how things evolve and more information is available here.
You won't lose any btc by just holding them. If you spend them incorrectly after a split it's possible to have them get confirmed on both chains at once which is something you likely do not want.

What matters is the "net" volume in China - that is "how many btc are being sucked into China by arbitrage". That number has to come from other exchanges and causes the other (non-Chinese) exchanges to rise.

You always take some risk selling btc for paypal. I've done it in the past on localbitcoins.com. For small amount it's not a big risk because generally any scam buyer there is going to want to scam bigger amounts. But anyway choose a buyer who has long history and solid 100+ fb level. There's not so many who want to buy small amounts but I have found some for the $100 range. That was around a year ago and maybe it's harder now.

This is a completely independent hardware USB dongle. It generates raw data that a driver "whitens" and mixes into the OS based rng, eg. to /dev/random. The circuit is simple for hobbyists and could be added into other hardware projects, eg. It would cost ~$1 to add a few parts to a RaspPi exp. connector and feed in thermal noise based RNG data without even tying up a usb port.
I bet someone could easily fit this into an SD card slot so it could be plugged into any notebook and appear as a file device. A small controller could do that and provide the SDI interface. Just an idea.

That's good because there's already GPU / FPGA cores that can check millions of hashes/second.

I'd like to think up some scheme with pre-signed transactions, since those cannot be altered. There doesn't seem like a natural good way that works upon death unless there is a company that could offer that service. 
You give them a pre-signed trx, pre-pay their fee, and they sit on it and periodically check you are alive, and when some condition is met they broadcast the transaction. 
Things like safety deposit boxes and wills are also dependent on a third party that is trusted upon death. It would be nice to work out a way to broadcast a pre-signed transaction without any externalities but I just don't see how. nTimelock comes to mind but I'm not sure that works or is sure to work in future.

Thanks. I figured it was pretty hefty but didn't have much info on that. I've tested mine on a few different vps/dedicated server platforms. It didn't require much RAM but an SSD is essential. I have a frozen (snapshot'd) system right now on vultr.com. I didn't want to pay monthly to keep it up when I'm not working on it. With either 2GB or 4GB it does very well. It's always slow to sync initially because it's building the whole sql db. After sync I ran it very nicely for a while on a 2 GB VPS. On that it syncs new blocks within a 1-2 seconds and that's even for the electrum server api (which has had very little testing). On the whole I was very happy with the performance but it does want a fast cpu and ssd to do the initial sync. I ran it on a 8GB 2 core "hybrid dedicated" node to sync and then snapshot'd it down to the 2GB vps for lower cost.

You seem so absolutely sure of yourself but you are wrong. It not because of sig data size in UTXOs that SegWit helps reduce it's growth.

I wrote a tool [sqlchain]( already that can be used or adapted to providing this data. It reads the blockchain on a full node (can be pruning) into a mysql db. Once you have that db you can easily get what you want. If you don't need all the data (for an explorer of other data analysis) then you could mod the script to not insert sql data you don't need and it would sync much faster. 
For full explorer level indexed data it can take a long time to sync fully (&gt; 1 week on a fast system) and really needs an SSD (the sql db queries bog down otherwise). Anyway, it's easy to install and run as there is an init script. See the install doc.
I seem to recall when fully sync'd the address table was 217 million addresses and about 6GB. But that is every address ever used not just the ones without current outputs. You can do a query on the db that provides utxo count at each block. I don't think I ever tried but I you should be able to not count addresses more than once. 
I don't know if this info is worth much to you. If you wanted me to fire up my (snapshot'd) node and db and sync it (last sync I did was at block 407000) and do the queries you need then for a reasonably cheap price for my time I could do that.

Maybe something like the side bar on Amazon that lets you select criteria for what shows up on the list to the right. Sometimes that sidebar doesn't work so well but when the choices are relevant it can work. Ideally done in client with js so it doesn't reload page content for every choice, or at least caches data so response is quick. I'm not sure there is so many wallets now to make narrowing selection useful, but maybe as time goes on there will be.
Also, after narrowing by OS, type, disk space, status, etc maybe select wallet icons on right and choose a "cross-compare" that shows up to 3 or 5 in columnar format to compare features.

I don't know how this works - you check the random numbers by verifying sample printed wallets? If not, then you cannot know if the random numbers used for wallet gen are from the same source as used for verification, or perhaps that the 'hacked' code doesn't switch methods after some number of initial samples. Or even that some external radio signal isn't telling it what mode to use.

Exchanges don't settle on the blockchain directly so there is no reason for the price drop to have any connection with that. It is just plain normal market behaviour that after a strong run up there is always a sell off. Traders keep buying until the tension is too much and they want to take profits and get out. The real reason for such a volatile market is that so many wanna-be day traders are in there trying to make quick buck. Everyone is panicky and sitting there with itchy trigger fingers. Of course, they pile-on and run up and jump off. It's nothing more than that, no (well, maybe a little) manipulation, just herd behaviour at work.

Your seed is a representation of the 128 bit random number used to generate all the key/address pairs in your wallet. If you are talking about a significant amount of money that you really cannot afford to lose then do not throw away your seed. It is the only way to recover fully when everything else has gone wrong.
If you are really worried about someone finding it then there are unlimited ways to use "obscurity" to your advantage as well as safely storing it. Some examples:
- don't write it down in correct order - write it down in variant order you can remember and then put a small amount on the first address in that order. That way if someone finds it they think they have the real wallet, but when you re-order the words you will have access to the real wallet. Of course, this is not in itself secure but I'm assuming you have it somewhere safe. eg. odd words then even words, last two reversed etc., or order of your birth date digits, repeat shift 1, whatever.
- encode it in some other way other than words. The 32 digit hex number version of the seed can be "written" in many ways - eg. notches or dents on a piece of metal buried under your back porch. 
- associate each word with a photo and then store those photos as part of your photo album. You only need the photos to prompt you to remember what the original word was for re-entry if ever needed.
I could keep coming up with crazy ideas but hopefully you get the idea you don't have to write it down labeled  "bitcoins - please steal".
BTW I didn't use any of the above schemes - really.

SegWit improves block usage (byte size) efficiency. But the main thing users want out of SegWit is that it fixes **malleability**. That is an issue where a tx can be altered slightly but still be valid such that you cannot depend on a single unique tx id for each tx. (MtGox claimed this was partly responsible for their losses so this has been an issue for years.) Several future improvements to Bitcoin like the Lightning Network, MAST, MimbleWimble ([ya you read that right]( Schnorr sigs all work a lot better with malleability fixed.

I don't know how much they have available. A driver wouldn't take much. The OS detection would take very little as well. That part would just look for specific signature data. I'd guess that it may take a few Kbytes of code to do all that's needed. The driver just acts as a relay for data to the net.

About a 22% gain. The problem is that hashes (which make up the bulk of the data) are basically random and do not compress well, plus the protocol is already binary data (even though we often view it as text / json).

There's probably more than a few tricks but the main one I know is *associated outputs*. That is, if you look at a tx then you can usually assume the outputs being spent are from the same wallet. So now you have a bundle of addresses expected to belong to one entity. The next method is *identifying the change output* since it usually goes back to the same wallet. If you repeat those two steps you can build up a map (in a database). Of course, this can be broken by CoinJoin and other mixing methods so it's not like it's strong enough to stand up in court but it seems to be enough that some exchanges might question your activities. 
Another method paired with above is *association of identity* by businesses that physically ship, or have ID docs. You can imagine that a govt agency may secretly make demands on businesses to take the info above and connect it with real identities. They may not be able to definitively prove links but it helps with determining who to investigate and monitor more closely.
Some of the 2nd layer Bitcoin systems in the pipeline now should make the network much more opaque and diverse.

ElectrumX runs on top of core. It's an Electrum server that provides data to Electrum clients (wallets). First, you install core then you install ElectrumX. Then you can connect to it with your Electrum wallet. Most Electrum users connect to public servers but you can also run your own like this.

Of course the speed of light is an upward bound. Electrons and data packets don't move faster than light. Whether that has discernible impact on block propagation is more a protocol issue but I can confirm living in Thailand that my average RTT to USA is typically &gt; 300 mS (most of that time is switching/buffering). If a protocol requires in-order packet error checking and re-transmission then that would limit max speed. I don't think most need that nowadays. However, I have not studied this effect for Bitcoin blocks and would not comment on this specific case.
and below that the important part:


As h4ckspett mentions above it really should be studied by simulation because not only does each node have to wait for blocks but they have to validate the block before they can relay to others. That acts as node latency as well.

Technically you can't cancel it but it probably should have been dropped by now. blockchain.info kind of has a history of not dropping old txs.
You can try restoring your wallet in electrum, make a backup copy of the wallet file without any new tx history, then try creating a new tx in that wallet. Save the tx to disk before trying to broadcast it. If it gets rejected by the network then try a different electrum server with the backup wallet file (copy it back) because likely only some nodes may have dropped the old one. If multiple servers won't relay the tx then you can try loading and pasting the saved tx hex data into a "push tx" page (several block explorers have such a page). 
Some miners also offer a service for getting txs included in blocks with a fee outside of the tx fee. I've not tried that myself.
@_date: 2017-07-10 08:34:39
That depends on what kind of offline wallet you use.
If you are using a paper wallet then you should "sweep" the private key into a wallet that supports that function. Most desktop and phone wallets have that ability. With paper wallets you need be careful where change outputs go and generally not re-use the paper wallet if swept or exposed on a net connected system.
If you use a wallet like Electrum offline when you create the wallet you can select a menu item to save the "master public key" or xpub to a usb stick and use that on an online system to create a matching watch-only wallet. This is a wallet that cannot spend btc but has all other functions like receiving and watching txs and the balance (for the identical addresses as the offline wallet). 
When you do want to spend it can create an "unsigned tx" which you then copy via usb stick (or qr code) to the offline wallet for signing. Many people use this security model and it's about as close as you can get to a hardware wallet for near zero cost. It trades cost for convenience as it takes 2-3 minutes to transfer an unsigned tx, sign it and copy back the signed tx for broadcast.
A hardware wallet is generally considered offline even though you usually plug it in to a potentially compromised system. This is because the private keys are kept safely stored in the hardware and are never exposed on the host system. Software like Electrum can create an unsigned tx that the hardware wallet signs internally and returns. The user must view and confirm the tx details on it's screen before it will sign the tx. This is more convenient, faster and less error prone than methods above.
I've used all three above. A paper wallet is less flexible but does work. Electrum on a usb boot stick or raspberry pi w/sd card is a very cheap but flexible method, and a hardware wallet is the most convenient dummy proof method.

I've used 4 coins and flipped hex digits to create an Electrum seed. You could do the same for a paper wallet but need twice as many coin flips. So for a seed I do 32 (x4 coins) and for a private key you need 64. 
The super easy way I generate hex from coin flips is first write down a simple hex digit "matrix". 4 columns by 4 rows where 2 coins select the column and 2 coins the row. eg. where H=heads, T=tails, this is a simple hex converter (many programmers can just do this in their head, but written down it's dead easy)
      TT  TH  HT  HH
    TT 0  1   2   3
    TH 4  5   6   7
    HT 8  9   A   B
    HH C  D   E   F
An Electrum seed can be entered from hex digits using the "restore wallet from seed" menu item. For private keys you can use bitaddress.org (offline) or [some other utility]( to convert a hex private key to a WIF format and address. I prefer using Electrum offline with seed over the paper wallet. It's easier to monitor and receive payments, and when you send (sign offline) you need not worry about change and sweeping.
There are also Hexadice - 16 sided die with hex digits, but coins are more readily at hand. Use a cup and shake for randomness and I found smaller coins seem to be more random - though that's not very scientifically tested. I wrote an Android app for testing dice and coins for bias (it's on Amazon because Google Play store costs money to join even to give away apps: [DiceCheck](
If you want a small Python script for converting hex keys to WIF then check out this simple utility (small and easy to check manually, and copy offline).

You could run two node instances with one set to sync from the other (to reduce net burden). Granted it's twice the data but if pruned that may still be small.

Your random source is critically important for a seed or key. You can roll dice or use a high quality computer generated source but don't make up your own by writing down digits. 
For example, if you roll dice, they should be casino dice with sharp edges, not cheap game dice which have a bias towards "1". Roll the dice about 100 times, and enter that in your linux cmd line as follows:
    echo "3421343... dice values ...43421" | openssl sha256

I don't think there is a reason not to use them. It gives you more flexibility but in particular for business it gives segregation between uses. The top execs can hold the root keys and then departments for specific use can hold segregated sub-account keys. There's probably lots of uses like that in business.
We're still pretty early in their deployment. I'm not aware of an HD wallet that offers multi-account use in a business practical sense. 
Also, the ability to restore all accounts from a seed value is a major advance over backing up normal wallets. With a seed you do it once when created and it backs up forever. With a normal wallet you need to keep regular back ups as the keys change.

It's not as useful a method as you suggest because very quickly all coins become tainted and it becomes a determination of what cutoff level of % stinkiness is acceptable.

You also have to remember that fees get paid on each trx, so at least some bits of any bad btc get washed into mined blocks and re-distributed that way.

I'm not sure pybitociontools supports the current version of electrum. It's pretty old. When you generate addresses from seed does it give the same ones as in electrum? Or are you not concerned with electrum if you just use pybitcointools?
Anyway, it should be straight forward based on a quick glance at the repo. It's not a library I've used myself, though the functions appear to be clear. 
Just to be sure you're clear. You use a seed to generate private keys and from the private keys generate public keys and then addresses. The library lets you skip the private keys and public keys and go straight to addresses but it should be using the same math.
Also, it's somewhat unsafe to be generating and using private keys outside of a wallet. If one private key is exposed or given to someone then all the others on the seed can be derived so usually it's not recommended to handle them, save and transfer them individually. Electrum only generates a private key when it needs to sign a tx and then it wipes it form memory. However, it is of course possible and you may have a use case for doing that.
If you can give concrete examples of what you are doing, what's not working and what you're trying to do I can help give working code. You may want to use PMs instead of posting here publicly.

I'd go with others here by not recommending blockchain.info however if you want to use it then what you are looking for is a backup phrase of seed words (probably 12 or 13 words). That is what you need to write down and store securely. With those words you can recover your wallet and restore it on other more advanced software like Electrum if you end up needing advanced control (like if a split happens).
blockchain.info like most modern wallets uses the seed words to generate all the private keys in your wallet. For security reasons the private keys are not normally shown in plain text in wallets or web sites but are generated internally as needed for signing txs.

You can use the electrum modules in python and then call the gap limit command that way. It's been a long time since I tried that so I'll have to test it here and let you know. 
Anyway, the gap limit is in the wallet file so you can just edit it there and it should take effect. Also, it only needs to be set once and when an address is used it checks the set value to decide whether to generate new addresses.
Here's a json fragment from a wallet file I have that should help you with how to set it that way:
    "gap_limit": 10, 
    "keystore": {
            "seed": ".....

You should never have  created your wallet on that computer in the first place. The whole intent behind watch-only wallets and offline storage is that you create the wallet on a system that will never again be connected to the net and then only copy the MPK over to the online system. Once you allow the wallet file to exist on a net connected system you are already at risk because you do not know what may be on that system or how it may be compromised. The only thing that saves you on the offline system is that it will never be online again to send any captured wallet details anywhere.
Wallet files in Electrum are completely independent and none are cleared or deleted by any action except your own steps to manually delete them. They are simple JSON format text files which are human readable. Only the xprv data is encrypted when you use a password. This also means that any hacker simply needs to send that small bit of text (~100 chars) over the net in order to crack your wallet file. It is encrypted with AES and can be brute forced in the same way as other AES based encrpytion. To my knowldege it is not yet supported by tools like hashcat but it could be easily as it is similar to keepassx (which is already supported) (meaning that GPU cracking could make short time of encrypted electrum wallets)(I myself have coded up an FPGA core which does this as a test case). Which is why the only truly safe way to use an Electrum wallet is with an offline system (or hardware wallet). Not that I'm putting it down because I use it and have developed for it. I think it's one of the best options.
BTW deleting a wallet file is not sufficient for security. Not only is there malware which looks for wallet files but it can simply scan free disk space for an xprv signature and capture the deleted data from that. You need to fully wipe the file using a program like shred, wipe or srm. If you have deleted wallet files in the past then those tools can also wipe free space on your drive.

Their accounting system uses a unique txid for each customer withdraw. eg. it's sql and the txid is a unique column prevented from inserting the same one for multiple withdraw records. This is the kind of thing some coder might do and in the past they never needed to move so many btc so fast so it wasn't any issue.
Of course a simple code fix that appends an output# to the tx_id would remedy the uniqueness but allow multiple withdraws per tx. Just isn't too smart to patch that in while doing real time live txs worth a fortune. So... maybe next time.

blockchain says you double spent because they tend to keep old txs in their mempool for far too long. Your new tx will propagate via nodes that have already dropped the old one and be mined if the miner has dropped the old one too. Most nodes drop after 72 hours, so if it's still within that time frame then the new one is more likely not propagating well. That is, any nodes that have your old one still active will not accept or relay the new one.
Likewise what electrum tells you depends on if your connected server has dropped the old one. Not sure how well the sync updates but possibly changing server can change status of an old tx, or allow sending a new one when many other nodes still have the old one.
@_date: 2015-11-03 04:14:55
Once you have the keys you can easily sweep them into Electrum. Install the software and create a new wallet (write down the seed words!), then choose menu Wallet, Private Keys, Sweep and paste the keys into that window. It will create a tx to spend all key balances into your new wallet. 
It does not import the keys, but it is also possible to create an "Import" wallet in Electrum solely for non-seed based imported keys. But you don't gain the benefits of a seed based wallet - one time backup, offline signing, etc.

Yes. On a personal level core is just as private. Though I guess an argument could be made that running a server allows hiding your personal traffic amongst the clients. It doesn't seem much of an advantage since txs don't contain IP info and tor could always be used for txs anyway.

Hardware wallets always provide the seed words for paper backup. A hardware wallet is really just a convenient way of using a "deterministic paper wallet". So any time a hardware wallet is lost or destroyed you can get a new one and restore from paper backup. Also, the paper backup can be used to restore with software like Electrum. AFAIK most hardware wallets are BIP39 compatible.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:50:09
afaik a bit has to "expire" before it can be re-used. That is, become no longer  meaningful. But also note that these bits are simply for signaling intent or desire. The only segwit code that has been written and tested on testnet for over a year is the bit 1 segwit. Even if bit 4 was signaled at 80% I think there will be issues with who will code and deploy such an upgrade and how well it will be tested first. Given the fiascos of previous BU code changes I have little trust that anyone but core devs will get code deployed safely. It could be a mess.

Assuming you edited the file you must have made a syntax error of some kind. If you have a backup then restore that, or restore from your original seed words. There's really no way for me to know what you actually did. Maybe left out a comma or something. It does work but if you're not very familiar with JSON syntax it's probably better to use the python method to set the gap_limit value.

It's a real shortcoming for the large ones, but for the smallest one I could see it being very handy to fire one up briefly as a proxy.

Fees are an incentive for a miner to include your transaction in a new block. Since your transaction takes up byte space in the block the fee is primarily dependent on transaction size and the current demand on block space available. So it can vary considerably over time on these factors. A while ago demand was high and fees got pushed up very high. Right now there is low demand (not enough txs to fill blocks) so fees are quite low. 
A good bitcoin wallet will estimate your fee when you create the tx based on current network demand and byte size. Not all wallets do a good job so many users will use a web site like  to guage whether they're including a suitable fee.
In theory you can include zero fees but nowadays that usually means your transaction will linger for too long waiting to be included in a block and eventually get discarded. Once upon a time I actually did send txs reliably with zero fees. Now you will typically pay from a few cents to a dollar for a regular small size transaction.

I'd suggest consolidating all your tiny outputs into a single large one right now while fees are low. I'd guess that even now you'll pay more in fees then you have in total but maybe you'll squeak by with a small profit. 
You could try to do it with zero fees but it requires special handling and may take a long time to confirm. Regardless, if fees go up again you'll be glad you did as they have little room to go down.

But note that any of these tools you are putting quite a bit of trust that they do as advertised. And if they don't your funds may be gone before you realize. You literally need to read the code fully on the exact download you use when generating the key. There are so many possible tricks and these tools are in most cases created by random unknown internet denizens. To give you an example: you view a web tool and read the code, looks ok. But then when you save it for offline you think you save the same code but the server detects a second request from same IP, or differing "user-agent" (git), and replaces a single line in all that code with one that injects a weak hash. You think you're safe but are not. 
Just my opinion.
You are better to use some generic tool like openssl, available always, anywhere.

There's another big difference other than just developer count. In "legacy" bitcoin the developers have only set rules for validation that are broadly accepted by the bitcoin community based on values I agree with. 
In BTC1 those rules would largely be determined by a very limited version of industry consensus and that is a much different thing. It will depend very much on profit motives which put them directly subservient to government controls. Currently Core devs can resist governmental control by just quitting, but it's very unlikely an industry controlled dev team will have that choice, or any values not reflecting an employee status.

Paper wallets protect against a different threat set than a mobile wallet like Breadwallet. With paper you eliminate any threat of software bugs, hacking, crypto weaknesses (except possibly how you generate a random key for paper; some people roll dice). When you scan a paper wallet you are once again introducing the key to those threats. Your mobile phone may be totally safe and paper wallets have their own threat models (theft, fire, photo snapshots etc), but the two have different threat models.
If no one knows you have a paper wallet they are unlikley to force you to reveal it. If someone checks your phone and see a balance there is more likelihood they will beat it out of you. With any wallet it's not about ultimate security but what type of threats are relevant.
It's generally considered best practice to not re-use a paper wallet key once it's been exposed to online threats but that doesn't mean you are going to have problems.

Electrum. No big download sync and still fully under your control. But there are other wallets too. Electrum just has a lot of flexibility and can be used as offline wallet for better security.
BTW the reason everyone says not to store on web wallets is that history has proven that to be dangerous. Too many people have lost their btc by trusting various web wallets and exchanges in the short life of Bitcoin. eg. MtGox, MyBitcoins, Bitcoinica, and many more smaller ones. You don't want to wake up one day to news LocalBitcoins has been hacked. On the other hand keeping them yourself requires decent personal security habits.

Be aware if you import the private key then you now have a **copy** of that key in your wallet. But the original key, wherever that is, and whatever created it, still exists and can be used to spend coins. ie. importing the key is not a very safe way to move your funds into your new wallet. 
You are much better off spending from that key into your own address because not only does that leave the less secure "original" key empty, but also ensures you can access the funds using only the seed words you wrote down somewhere safe. Spending the funds into your wallet is also called "sweeping" the key - better than importing the key. However, there are cases where importing is acceptable.

That's so if you don't use that feature you don't need to have the modules installed on your system. eg. don't need AES and scrypt if not using BIP38. Originally I had ecdsa also only needed when getting the address. As I added more stuff it ended up always being needed. I actually can do this without ecdsa module by pulling in 4 math functions I have in some other util. Upside - works with default python install. Downside - may be a math error in my functions (though I did a fair bit of testing).
(I ran the BIP38 encrypt/decrypt through a random test script for several hundred keys and it didn't fail. I should let it run overnight someday but it kinda heats up the CPU when churning away on scrypt.)

Here's my projection: BCC forks and goes live, most users start selling, Jihan/Ver start buying like crazy to support the price and make it look valuable. Maybe that works for a while but how much of their BTC do they want to convert to BCC? At some point they can't support it more and the price plunges. Maybe they get out then or not. But as the price drops it doesn't matter how many miners mine it they aren't going to want to mine less valuable tokens than BTC. How this all affects BTC I don't know but since everyone is getting BCC out of nowhere the sell pressure is much greater than on BTC (unless Jihan/Ver really go ape shit and dump BTC in huge volumes). Maybe BTC has few miners for some period and slow blocks but that's not as much a problem as worthless coins. Worthless coins will cause miners to question why they are mining them and shift hash back to BTC. So bottom line? I expect massive volatility in prices until the market figures out where it stands. If BCC trends towards any value expect BTC to fall. The faster BCC falls the more stable BTC will be.

Do you want to open Electrum when you click on a bitcoin address? If so, then you have to configure your browser to handle the url and open Electrum.

Check if one trx is marked as double spend on a block explorer. I've had recent cases where some sort of malleability attack was made on a trx and it showed twice in Electrum for me.

Also, I'd note, if you do send from one address in your wallet to another in your wallet Electrum will say "0 btc sent", which can seem odd, but it only means that your wallet balance will not change (except fee loss) as btc do not leave the wallet overall.

segwit2x activating means the network gets segwit because the miner majority will create segwit blocks and you don't need to do anything. If you actually upgrade your node/client to segwit2x then you are accepting the 2x part and as long as you run that you cannot opt out of 2x. 
But if you stay on legacy core then you gain segwit without the 2x. The  question is when those running 2x do finally hard fork in a few months: how many users and miners will remain on the legacy network. I expect many or most users will remain but how many miners do is currently a gamble. If very few miners do then the legacy blocks will be very slow until a difficulty adjustment occurs (up to 2016 blocks). 
If all you want is segwit then stay on legacy or install UASF-BIP148. Both will give you that. If you're a fan of Jihan &amp; Co and want to be on their miner-rich network then run the 2x / btc1 / abc / whatnamenext? client and report in for anal probing.

You do have to spend from the same address you received on but that's not considered re-use. 
There are two aspects of address re-use to consider. First,  if you receive multiple payments on to a single address that considered re-use but the only down side in this case is loss of privacy. Every user that sent to your address probably knows your identity and can see that others also sent to you and gains that knowledge. 
The second is when you spend multiple times from an address. Spending requires exposing the public key in the tx data. That makes it a little bit easier to crack the private key because it loses the protection of the address hashes. It's still very difficult to brute force the key and it's not generally considered weak (except maybe in terms of quantum computing).
When you have multiple pmts (outputs) on an address it is more likely you will spend from the address multiple times because a single spend may not use up all the outputs on the address. Most wallets handle the selection of outputs and creation of new "change" addresses to minimize the re-use of addresses and it's not deadly if they get re-used, just preferable.
There are situations where you simply do need to receive many pmts on a single address like when posting a donation address on a web site or displaying it on videos or TV. Not much can be done there regarding privacy anyway. Bitcoin doesn't really offer much privacy and to have decent anonymity you really need to be careful with wallet use (until some better privacy becomes the norm with 2nd layer protocols, eg. lightning network, tumblebit, mimblewimble, etc).

I've been using the old rasp pi as a Electrum offline wallet for a couple years and it cost me nothing because I've always used it as an XBMC media center anyway. It's more than adequate for this. 
So when I want to access my offline wallet I shutdown XBMC, swap the SD card to my Raspian/Electrum SD card, pull the ethernet cable, plug in a keyboard and boot up. Now it's a safe offline wallet. It still needs my password for access and the seed is safely stored elsewhere in case of problems. I only use this to sign transactions I create on my desktop so that's not very often. Typically I send some btc to my Android Mycelium wallet for daily use.
It's best to install Electrum yourself (first and only online boot) rather than depend on some pre-made system image and it only takes a few minutes anyway.

But signaling doesn't mean you are running a BIP148 node. To do that you cannot run the bitcoin core from their website. You need to download (build) and run the one from the UASF web site. Otherwise on Aug. 1st regardless of signaling you will still be running legacy core and accept non-segwit blocks.

Many (most?) deterministic wallets offer watch-only wallet functions. eg. Electrum and Mycelium both have this. It's a key advantage of this type of wallet because it allows you to create flexible but secure offline btc storage. 
You create the seed offline and write it down (usually as a word sequence but that's not required). Then you generate the master public key (sometimes called xpub) from the master private key (often called xprv), and copy only that (MPK or xpub) over to a convenient online system for a watch-only wallet. It can do everything except sign txs. It can create unsigned txs that need to be copied (usually by memory stick) over to the offline system for signing. Electrum does this very well and can use a hardware wallet as the offline wallet (where the seed is stored).
Yes, when you want to sign the tx (offline preferably) it needs to generate the private key from the seed and then use that to sign the tx. Other than signing txs (or messages) it's not necessary to keep it around. Addresses are derived from public keys only.
It works because of basic math principles. While elliptic curve math is more convoluted the basic idea in ordinary day-to-day math is associativity, like this:
(2 x 3) x 4 = 3 x (4 x 2) (ie. the order doesn't matter). 
So if a (seed * sequence = private key) and (private key * generator = public key) then a (seed * generator * sequence = public key) can be used to skip the private key exposure. 
(For those with better crypto/EC math skills I'm aware this isn't fully accurate with EC math but it's to illustrate roughly the idea).
Note: the math is a double edged sword. The same principles mean that knowing another private key in the generated sequence allows finding all private keys in the sequence. So that is why with deterministic wallets you must never expose any private key in the sequence. BIP39 adds key hardening which breaks this requirement to some extent by having multiple sequences with hardening between them.

Ya. I don't know why people are getting so worked up. Either BCC goes to zero fast and they did all that hand wringing over nothing or BCC has some value and BTC drops to offset it. Free money isn't free - it comes out of market value somewhere else. But I guess it's good that at least some portion will split and sell them off asap. The quicker the price drops the sooner miners will know they want to stay on BTC.

There are quite a few Electrum servers run by volunteers mostly. I think around 20 last I checked. The client randomly selects one or you can set it to use a fixed one you trust. There was some talk about having it spread requests over multiple servers so they cannot associate addresses but I don't know if that ever went further. By default the servers don't log clients but, of course, it's possible to alter that. You can run your own (private or public) if you like (on top of bitcoin core).

Well, they serve different purposes. The password is for normal daily use and is only needed when you want to spend - so it can decrypt the seed and generate keys. It protects you against someone sitting at your computer and using your wallet and some forms of malware (that can't key log for example).
You should not normally need the seed and it should be stored somewhere very safe off the computer. A watch-only wallet is typically used in companion with a secondary offline wallet to allow offline signing for higher security.

The way around this is to make the algorithm very simple and memory the determining factor. Then Jihan can only get into the memory business to compete and for that he has to go against Samsung (and all). 
I'm not a mathematician but my rather simplistic reading of the cuckoo white paper was that it could be used in a way that kept the algorithm simple and primarily memory would determine rewards. Now Jihan can buy memory too but not much cheaper than everyone else and he can't control it's supply. 
Ideally I see a processing part that can be done on an FPGA or 10nm or 45 nm ASIC or GPU and not be much different in final result because it's 99% memory bound. There should be little incentive to even design an ASIC.

Simplified answer: LN is built on top of Bitcoin. With the right script (op code) it is possible to "lock" btc in a tx to an address for some time period. Kind of like escrow for some time.
In that state you can now create txs spending some of the locked btc but NOT broadcast them yet. As you spend more of the locked btc you can create new txs with a higher spend amount, again not broadcasting. Finally at some point after many of these unsent txs you "settle" on the blockchain by actually broadcasting the one with highest amount. It gets put in a block and closes out the locked btc.
 
That is called a payment channel. I've made it simple if not perfectly accurate as some aspects are more complex but this is the general principle. 
Now, take a whole lot of payment channels between various nodes operating as services and connect them together. I pay X, X pays Y, Y pays vendor. That is Lightning Network - a network of payment channels.
At any moment each LN node only knows about their own txs states (locked btc, txs held ready to send) and only a opening and final closing tx is ever visible on the blockchain. So that cuts down total tx volume and increases privacy. 
There are other enhancements to this as well, like onion routing (don't know who is paying who) that make it even more exciting.
The locking tx aspect of LN is hard to implement efficiently if txs are malleable (tx id can be changed) which is why LN has been held up waiting for Segwit (which fixes that). LN is workign now on testnet with Segwit. When Segwit locks in we should soon see real world LN tests.
You can think of LN as a network of private ledgers backed by Bitcoin. The locked tx nature ensures no one can steal or fake txs.

HD = Hierarchical Deterministic
Hierarchical = Wallet can have a series of sub-accounts based off a single "root" seed. Seems most current HD wallets only expose one account, though technically many can be created. Each account typically has many key pairs generated from the account key.
Deterministic = The key pairs are generated in a sequence based of an algorithm from a seed, or parent key. The math used ensures that knowing the seed/parent will always result in the same sequence when repeated.
The standard definition most current wallets use is [BIP32]( (Bitcoin Improvement Protocol  Check that git page for the full technical definition of how the algorithm works. In brief, it takes a seed and appends sequential values and hashes that to get each key pair.
This [diagram]( gives an overview.
One of the beauties of this method is you can create a sequence of addresses without the private keys by using the parent public key. This allows for safe watch-only wallets.

Not sure what you mean by this. You can send btc to your own address if you like. If you're thinking you want btc to appear as if they come from a different address than the one you received them on then you could send to another address in your wallet and then send to someone else from there. 
But otherwise you cannot create an address and then send from it without first receiving on it. Bitcoin works by consuming previous outputs and creating new ones. What you see as a balance on an address is actually the sum of outputs to the address. You combine those and create a new output on another address so it only makes sense to create an address for receiving btc.

That screen is missing some values and the nice coloured bar graph across the top. I guess it's related to screen size and getting cutoff. Here's what it should look like,
If you choose hex dice appearance then it shows buttons for 0-F instead 1-16. I assumed your dice were 0-F hex dice but maybe not. If you have 1-16 then it's ok. You would have noticed while tapping buttons. I don't know why it seems to be so biased. Try just doing random tapping and see how it skews. Then try to balance it out to get a good fairness. If that works ok, then I'd assume the app is ok and it's likely the dice is biased. I do see a strong peak in the 7,8,9 digits. That could be statistically enough to throw out fairness.

The encryption happens at a higher level before raw data gets sent to the disk. But that layer needs to load from the boot device. In linux the boot device can be different from the OS (root) device, and so that boot process would need to be carefully worked out. The kernel image initially comes from the boot device, but it typically starts pulling in modules from root. So encryption needs to be compiled into the kernel and not a loadable module. That's about as far as my knowledge goes. And on Windows I doubt there any hope at all.

If I recall it uses the initial power up state of static ram cells as input to hash function to generate random values. It's one reason why you need to re-plug it in to get more random values. So I guess they could replace it with a chip that has special predictable static ram cells, or add hardware that inits ram cells pre-boot (hold cpu in reset until cells have been written). But it would have to remember state between power ups, requiring a small amount of flash memory, and a secondary cpu core. It's probably all possible but I'd doubt them being able to do it in the time since this device was finalized in design, produce them and get them into fake but identical devices to swap.
Though it could be the reason it took so long for the factory to get things completed if that was the interception point.

In cryptography a signature is a mathematical proof of key ownership/control. Using the private key you can sign some data that can then be verified with the public key. This is how Bitcoin works - each transaction contains such a signature proving control of the private key for each input amount. But the same private key can just as easily sign arbitrary data, not just transaction data. So it is very easy to prove control of a private key by signing some message and the whole world can verify that with the public key, in the same way the Bitcoin network verifies transaction data.
That this has been drawn out into a fiasco is ludicrous. Every Bitcoiner signs tx data with every spend, and could easily sign any message in less a minute with any normal wallet software. 
There is another similar type of signature being discussed as well. That is a PGP signature of file contents for the Electrum download. This is another typical use of signature - to prove origin of arbitrary data. If the Electrum file signature matches the known good one then we can be certain a good copy of Electrum was used, and not a modfied/hacked one. However, if someone can control download of Electrum then they can also probably control download of the signature file for it. So relying on file signatures requires much more care in this case.  
As for the Genesis block - that's another issue and not entirely important for this fiasco as any sufficiently early block is probably enough for demonstrating key control and identity, at least as far as I'm aware.

There's always costs, risk, delays and hassle involved with "real" arbitrage which presumably are not incorporated into simple analysis. Also, very few people are ready to take advantage of specific trades. Every time you trade one way you need to have a way to offset the trade (unless you are also involved in some external business that happens to do that). 
eg. buying BTC in China for sale in Russia, you need to get the roubles back into yuan (risk) to continue the loop, or wait on a reversal (risk), or happen to be involved in buying products in rouble for shipping to China (unlikely), plus hold currency on exchanges (risk) and also pay fees.

Your typical Electrum user isn't going to run the server. The reason they use Electrum is that it's a light client and doesn't download the blockchain. Install and go, no sync, requires few resources, instant wallet up and running.

No, that isn't enough because when you spend from a wallet it will combine btc from several addresses. That can create association that indicates they have the same owner (unless you have technical knowledge and are very careful). So if you spend on one site to buy porn, and then spend on another to buy a tennis racket. Then the tennis shop, with some expertise, or when some govt demands, could associate the porn purchase back to the wallet that bought the tennis racket. Well, maybe no one really cares about porn, or maybe they do if you hold an important position or public office, or maybe it's just other criminals that want to extort you. 
Or, maybe you have a large holding and some criminal associates your tennis racket purchase to the large holding and gets your address - where they can then show up with a gun and demand you hand over the keys to your big addresses. 
Privacy is critical when your funds are sitting on a public ledger. Mixing, if not well executed isn't even enough.

Electrum offline offers all 3. Almost free (cost of usb stick). Liquid, with minor inconvenience for offline signing which takes a minute or two. Secure, as long as you safely write down your seed words and don't connect the offline system after wallet creation.
But your 3 variables aren't enough anyway - there's also learning curve/difficulty as a variable. Electrum is easy to use but it's not immediately obvious. You do have to spend time figuring out how to use it offline. I think that's likely true of hardware wallets too, as they need a bit of figuring out, and paper wallets, where you can mess up bad if you don't know how to spend from them.

Satoshi chose 10 minutes because that seemed like a good balance between network latency and block time. The shorter the block time the higher percent the network latency is of the block time. At some point it is more profitable for miners to include less txs in a block (smaller block, shorter latency) than to mine full blocks. This is because while their new block is being relayed across the network another miner could find a block and start relaying theirs instead. When this occurs we get orphans on the network (happens every day already). With shorter block times the statistical chance of higher orphan rates increases - meaning you cannot trust single block confirmations any more and must wait for multiple blocks for same level of safety, thus defeating the purpose of faster blocks.
Latency is important for bigger blocks too. Each node that relays a block has to first validate the block, which takes time. So block latency is the time to transfer a block plus the time to validate it, repeated for each node in turn. The big miners now use a fibre channel link between themselves to try and reduce this time. But what about everyone else? They don't have that speed, which forces them to either mine small blocks or risk having their block orphaned.

Probably a combo of currently high fees and maybe a larger than normal tx size. Check the tx details for byte size (or on a blockchain viewer). Typical txs run ~ 250 bytes. But if you have several low value inputs then it can easily double or triple that. In which case the effective fee/byte drops (unless you bump fee to cover extra size). This is why dynamic fees in electrum are useful - fee is not best seen as per tx but a per byte.

It is wallet dependent but in most cases it is sourced from the OS random source, eg. on linux from /dev/random or /dev/urandom. Some use whatever is available in the programming language chosen, which often relies more or less on OS source. In hardware it may be based on thermal noise or other circuitry combined with shaping algorithms, or static ram power on init states being hashed. Some have secure enclave chips that have purpose built circuitry as TRNG. 
You would have to to look into each specific wallet source code to know for sure. Also, using a wallet is trusting that the RNG code has not been tampered with. For example, if the RNG code has been replaced with PRNG (pseudo) then the seed could be deterministic and anyone knowing the PRNG seed could predict all seeds, as a kind of "super-seed", which obviously would render all derived keys compromised.

1. Yes and No. If a wallet indicates it is BIP39 compatible then it may work with other wallets. Electrum uses it's own seed method but can restore BIP39 wallets. Seems most wallets are BIP39 but you still should always test before assuming it will work with others. Bitcoin core uses it's own format as well because all keys are hardened.
2. Yes, but so unlikely as to be impossible. The seed is an encoding of a 128 or 256 bit random value. To get the same seed words you would need the same random value. But both 128 and 256 bits are extremely large numbers - much larger than your example. eg. 2^128 = 3.4×10³⁸ (that's 38 zeros) and 2^256 = 1.16×10⁷⁷. Obviously 256 is better but even 128 is well beyond the capabilities of searching at current speeds.
3. It doesn't. There have been some good posts about likelihood of finding large random numbers over the years. I'd suggest the youtube video by what's his name... can't recall. Someone will post.  **edit** - ah here it is:

I've been programming 90% for bitcoin since 2013 by doing small contracts online. I typically have to sell some each month to cover costs. Most of that time I lived in Thailand where costs were very low. They have decent Bitcoin facilities there, ie. easy to get cash out. It was actually cheaper than using the bank network (atm) and my US bank account. I haven't used that account in two years now. This lifestyle wouldn't suit everyone (living cheap in developing country ) but I liked it and only worked 2-3 days/month on average. Plus Thai women are beautiful. I lived there 15 years and rarely had any problems.

Going back and re-reading your OP, I see you need some clarity.
A bitcoin private key is simply a **random number** below a given max value defined by the secp256k1 standard. You can generate that random number as the output value from sha256. That is all. Nothing else needed.
The generation of an **address** from that key is standard and will work the same by any tool designed for Bitcoin and not some other alt coin. It is a simple EC math process of multiplying the key by the generator point and formatting into base58.

This is used for HD wallets (from BIP terminology) and I believe it refers to a master/intermediate key which can be used to generate more public keys that can be spent to.
@_date: 2015-03-30 02:24:27
You have a basic misunderstanding regarding bitcoin addresses. There is no tracking of keys/addresses that prevents others from getting your address. It is simply based on the principle of very (very) large numbers and the extreme low probability of two cases of generating exactly the same number.
Private keys are simply very large random numbers (with very small exclusion ranges). Anyone can generate the same key/address but that likelihood is so close to zero that we treat it as such.
This is why Electrum can give you key/address pairs without worrying that others will have or later get the same one. But this isn't unique to Electrum - it's the same for all wallets and all key/addresses in the system.

ASICs are good at some kinds of algorithms and poor at others. In order to make specialized ASIC hardware less able to out perform mass market miners (like CPU/GPUs) usually an algorithm that is memory bound is chosen.
Memory bound means that the time spent accessing memory is far greater than the time spent doing computations. Since memory chips are already super optimized, cheap and commonly available making them the determinant of hash rate means that ASICs have little or no advantage.
ETH uses a memory bound algorithm (SHA-3/Keccak) but others are available like [cuckoo]( based on graph theory. 
In the case of a POW change the effect would be to render current ASIC hardware obsolete. Jihans response to that is to fork and continue to be "masters of the universe". No surprise because current miners have large investments in sha256 ASICs and would be left unable to sell them.
The intent is to return control to a much wider base of users who are able to afford widely available hardware like back in the early days of Bitcoin when CPUs and GPUs were the primary mining platforms. That should improve decentralization and reduce the potential for a small group to enforce validation rules.

As I mention below Electrum will let you do this by choosing New Wallet, Restore, Standard  and entering the hex value (32 digits, 128 bit entropy).

Technically you don't need the xpub. You can always derive it from the xprv. The xprv is derived from the seed words, so the basic core item you need on paper is the **seed words**. The xpub is useful if you want to make a watch-only wallet because then you don't need to expose the xprv on a net-connected system to create the xpub.

Back then the wallet.dat file contained many (usually 100 or more) private keys. It wasn't deterministic yet, ie. no seed. I don't recall now if it allowed watch-only addresses but it seems likely. I may be mixing it up with some other wallet back in those days. Anyway, if it did then you could insert addresses without their keys allowing watching but not spending and the total would reflect that. It's a bit tongue in cheek because that was long ago and even though I used it around that time I don't really recall what it actually supported then.

That will work. 
But doing the same idea with Electrum will be much more flexible and in the end easier to manage. You boot on your Tails or other LiveCD/USB linux distro. Install Electrum (which is easy enough). 
Disconnect. 
Open Electrum and Create a new wallet. 
Write the 12 seed words down on paper just like you would have the key if you'd used bitaddress.org, only this gives you unlimited key/address pairs.
Then export the Master Public Key to a usb stick to later import into your online system because that allows you to have a watch only "live" wallet to safely monitor your offline wallet. You can then generate new addresses for receiving more btc without exposing your keys.
This method allows you to spend safely offline without worrying about "change" by creating an unsigned trx online and then taking it to the offline wallet to sign. This is similar to a Trezor methodology with a few more steps for spending, so cheaper, but less convenient.

Option  BTC multisig works and has worked for more than 5 years. 
My main wallet was Electrum multisig for 2 years and I never doubted it nor had any issues. And if you are using 2 hw wallets then you are not using Electrum multisig but BIP39. 
If Electrum fails in some way you can still use other BIP39 software to generate keys and do multisig signing. I doubt there is a wallet out there that has been more real-world tested than Electrum. Perhaps bitcoin-qt. I don't know of any way to measure that.

I'm not really up on Multibit but these issues come to mind:
When you delete the wallet.dat, to be secure, you need to use a shred program to ensure the raw data doesn't still remain on disk. Malware can scan free space for that data.
Do you need to restore the wallet file to your desktop system to check balance and trx are as expected? This is cumbersome and insecure. A malware infection could install a key logger that would monitor for both the wallet.dat and the password you enter to gain access. So bringing that wallet.dat back to an online system exposes you.
Maybe Multibit has a better offline signing model available and you should use that, or if not then switch to Electrum. It has an offline signing model. You can create the wallet offline (write down seed words) and only bring the Master Public Key to the online desktop system for safe watching and creating new addresses (no private keys on this system). Your offline wallet never gets exposed to the internet. 
When you want to spend you create the trx on your desktop watch-only wallet but save it "unsigned" to usb stick and then take that to the offline system for signing, and bring back to broadcast on the net.
The offline system need not be new hardware - you can use a usb boot stick. As long as you disconnect from the net while booting and using that OS, any malware cannot send anything out, even if infected when first created.
Since Electrum is an HD wallet all it's keys are generated from a seed. This means you never have to worry about "change" going somewhere else - it always goes to an address in your wallet, even when signed offline. The seed words are critical to making a paper backup that allows you to recover your wallet even if the disk media get corrupted, destroyed or stolen.
There's more to be said about all this so best to read up. I like using a raspberry pi as my offline system by simply swapping an SD card to boot while disconnected.

Pools are like a handshake saying I'll share with you if you'll share with me and we both don't check the same hashes. Each miner in the pool checks different hashes (their "work") and in total they combine their efforts for faster hashing. At the math level it still comes down to the same hashing as solo miners but with better odds for smaller shares.

There's a few possibilities I can think of:
- users got fed up with high fees and have decided to only send if absolutely required. Possible but people are not usually so like minded.
- users got scared of the upcoming changes and want to just hunker down and not move their btc. Maybe partly this.
- a lot of the activity was generated by "someone" hoping to increase block size and needing industry consensus to force the issue. Some people think this is likely because how else do you explain tx volume suddenly falling after such an agreement was formed. Suspicious or no?

I expect a lot of miners to switch to BCC initially and it to have a higher hash rate than BTC. But hash rate does not determine value as long as some miners are on both sides. The main forcing factor here is that people have BTC and they are getting "free" BCC so the sell pressure is primarily on BCC side. It has to be offset by massive buying from the Jihan/Ver camp to even hope of keeping some value.
The fact that BTC is still keeping fairly stable implies the market does not expect it to drop much in a few days.

Yes, theoretically that's possible but it's hard to over emphasize how unlikely that is.
The seed is a random 128 bit number, and the words are an encoding of that in a readable form. So even if we say there are 1 billion active wallets (there is much less), a 128 bit number is 2^128 possible wallets, or 340282366(+30 more zeros...) wallets, then the chance of finding any wallet is 1 in 340282366(+21 more zeros...). Which is still about 43 billion times the number of grains of sand on Earth. So it would be like finding a specific unique grain of sand on 43 billion Earths.

Two things: you shouldn't keep a wallet on a server if it has keys in it, and you'd be much better off with a light client like [Electrum]( if you don't keep it running 24/7.

We worry about this because we do see, now and then, posts about someone losing their btc due to being hacked or malware. If you get malware, or a physical intruder, that installs a keylogger and captures your password then it's game over. With the wallet and password they can decrypt the seed and steal everything. You will not know until it's gone. Now for fairly small amounts it's probably not a big worry as your system may be reasonably secure. But for amounts you don't need access to every day why take that risk. All it takes is a kid plugging in a usb stick to play a game, or sloppy use of a web site or Teamviewer. Most users do not have good security so keeping large sums offline is good risk avoidance.

You probably shouldn't assume. Mycelium, Electrum and breadwallet are all BIP39 compatible but I saw no mention of that on the jaxx site. I didn't look too deep though. There's probably a jaxx reddit you can go check on. Even with BIP39 wallets they don't always play nice with each other. Another way to be sure is to create another test wallet and then try entering the backup words in Mycelium or Electrum and see if you get the same address list as jaxx. If not, then it indicates compatibility problems - but really someone very familiar with jaxx can probably give you better info.

That archive above has the info you need for that. I have imported that data into sql db before and processed it in some ways. I don't think it would be hard to select some exchanges and build an average price per unit time going quite far back. You may have to pick and choose different exchanges for various time periods as they were available or relevant.
From what I've heard the first public btc price point was when those pizza sold for 10,000 btc. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 16:26:31
It would be a second wallet on your desktop. You can switch between them with File, Open or create a shortcut for each directly by putting the wallet filename on command line (-w filename). You create a "watch-only" wallet by choosing restore File, New/Restore and entering the MPK instead of seed. 
I'd say most HD type wallets support some variant of this but at this time the compatibility between them is poor. I don't have a list of which ones. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 06:25:58
No, the MPK is not a seed. It allows creating addresses without needing or exposing the seed or private keys. (MPK = Master Public Key, the generated from the seed but not exposing the seed.) 
Electrum lets you view the QR code for the MPK on screen. So you could snap that with Mycelium once and then keep a watch on any addresses in that wallet even if the wallet was created on Tails totally offline (and never connected). That's why it would be a nice thing.

I should note that it's not that obvious in Electrum. If you want to do that you choose "File New/Restore", then "Existing seed" and have to click the options button and choose BIP39, otherwise it probably will just gray out the "Next" button and seem to not accept it.
Also, you should aware that the original Copay wallet is still fully active so any remaining (non-wiped, secure deleted) seed on another system is usable and will continue to expose the wallet if left unsecured.

Convenience only. You can recreate your wallet from the seed words but it's extra effort to enter each time and also exposes you to a key logger. Well, if you keep the wallet then you only need a password when you spend. For a balance of convenience/safety you can de-seed the wallet - allowing you to still watch-only but needing the seed words to restore spending.
Also, if you label any transactions then that info cannot be recreated from seed. You either save the wallet or use the online label safe.
@_date: 2015-02-18 04:14:44
Not really. A log scale shows the move from 0.10 to 1 as importantly as a move from 100 to 1000, because that is actually the same growth or ROI, whereas linearly the former looks insignificant. 
On this chart the first few years looks flat because it is dwarfed by the big dollar wise move above $100. The move up to $100 should look larger than the move above $100 because percentage wise it was much bigger. A log scale represents that information much better.
ie. even though the chart says a 400,000% increase the huge peak actually represents only 1000%, or 1/400th, of that gowth.
@_date: 2015-02-25 09:41:50
Yes, that's right. The relationship between parent private key - public key is held across it's children. So knowing the public key allows creating child addresses without private key. And later the same sequence algorithm to the private key will generate child keys for spending. 
This is the way a merchant can safely gen addresses online for customers without risking it's private keys on the server. They can be generated offline as needed in a "backend" process for consolidating/moving funds. 
edit: with the exception, I believe, of the "hardened keys". Those require knowing the private key to generate keys below that chain. This was designed to prevent isolation between chains.

You can get schooling if you like but if you can learn under your own direction then you'll get much further, faster. Most programmers, I'd guess, especially open source , just dig in and learn by doing, and keep on doing for life. While open source code like this is entirely an unpaid labour of love, even finding a real job is going to primarily depend on your skills and usually involves a brief exam during interview, rather than a stack of degrees. The proof is in the pudding, and having a github to display your chops is getting to be a norm.

Most people probably just keep the seed written on paper somewhere safe. You can come up with all kinds of enhancements and redundancy on top of this. How many btc you have and your specific circumstances will dictate how you want to handle it. Things like wills/inheritance can be planned in as well.
I'd suggest using a passphrase on the seed. That way even if someone gets the seed they will still need to do a lot of work/time to break in. 
Many people like to enhance the paper with a metal backup for fire protection. I've done this recently but used to just fold up paper tiny seed word lists and hide them in devices I had. That becomes less satisfactory as the btc amount goes up. 
I'd recommend not getting too complex as years from now when needed there is nothing worse than being stuck not remembering what you did. That does come up here in posts now and then.

Copay is BIP39 compatible and you have the seed (keys) under your own control. However, you don't control the network that Copay broadcasts txs on so if you want to be sure you have btc on a specific fork if that occurs you probably would want to avoid doing txs when it's ambiguous and possibly restore the wallet to Electrum where you can select which server to use for txs.
@_date: 2019-05-18 09:28:43
If Coinomi allows you to spend unconfirmed btc then you can go ahead and create a new spend to your Trezor. Add a high enough fee to cover both this new tx plus extra such that it would raise the last (unconfirmed tx) to a high enough level. Miners will see the dependent tx with high fee and mine both txs because they will get both fees. ie. the extra high second fee is incentive to mine the lower first fee. This is called CPFP (child pays for parent). 
If Coinnomi doesn't let you spend unconfirmed btc then you either have to wait or restore your wallet seed into a wallet that does (like Electrum). The fees go up and down based on demand, and could very well go back down soon - it's just hard to know what the future activity will be. Fees have been dropping over the last 2 hours so it is not out of the question.
If you do use CPFP you'd want to use a fee of about 20 sat/b times the byte sum of this new tx plus the initial unconfirmed one.

The blk*.dat files are archived sequentially and don't get updated again. Only the last one changes as new blocks arrive. Other files may change - like index dir and others but I'm not sure what and how they change. 
I experimented once with OverlayFS and it worked. I wanted to keep changing data (upper) on ssd and the rest on hard disk (lower). I found little gain in speed so just reverted back to all on hard disk. 
You can delete chainstate and it will rebuild from blocks (re-validate), or you can move it to another drive using a symbolic link. That's a few GB anyway.
You could also use prune option and set a very high GB value that would discard oldest blocks. If you do that you can't use txindex but otherwise your wallet will work as long as you don't have txs back in those early blocks. If you want to go back to not pruning then it would have to ~~rescan~~  re-sync from zero.
If you know you are going to get more space later you could copy the blocks dir off to temp drive and enable pruning for now. Then later copy all blocks to the bigger drive and continue without pruning. If you do it right it will work. Only an intact blocks dir is needed for recovery at some later date.

You can just change the port setting. If you only have one public IP then you'll only be able to run one node as listening for connections but the other node can still connect out and function nearly as well. If you have two public IPs then you can use port forwarding to set each IP to a different local port.
Maybe you checked BCC and found the BitConnect price since they also use the same symbol. Otherwise that price is much lower than I would have expected at this point. I have not bothered to go and research. I don't really care what it sells for because the market will adjust the Bitcoin price down for any gain in BCC. It won't be instantaneous so some will likely play that game. I won't bother.

Well, a miner does validate trx to create new blocks but each node also validates trx on it's own and only accepts blocks that it can self validate. It ensures it's own copy of the blockchain is valid independently of the miners. Back when Bitcoin started every user ran a node. In the early days each node could mine as well since it used CPU to do that but as time passed these functions became specialized and the code was split out into separate programs. Now we have nodes, miners, pools, wallets and sometimes special functions built on top of these. Quite the labyrinth nowadays. The incentive for running a node now is simply supporting the network and being important to Bitcoin.

They could create a Ubuntu PPA and add the repo to the sources list. Ideally it would have a Web UI for doing various cool things like looking up trxs or stats. And also, tools for upgrade (which should not be automated even with PPA), ie. just like Update Manager asks for upgrades.
Such a web panel could allow them to communicate with customers about upgrade choices etc. I think such a "branded" node interface could have big implications for the network if (when?) the number of non-tech users deciding to run nodes exceeds the number of hard core coiners. 
I could see a company offering incentives to run a node beyond what just the core network offers, and it could become a form of botnet (assuming non-hostile as otherwise users would shut off, or would they?).

I don't know if an S9 is the best any more. Didn't they already announce a new one? Anyway, they were the most efficient up til now and if you bought those at $2400 each then you have ~56,000 GH/s for 5.6 kWh.
According to the [calc]( I plugged that into that would give you about 0.0585 BTC in a month and it will go down continually after that.
At 0.10 USD/kWh and 10% avg. diff. increase you'll start to go negative in 161 days. BTC would have to reach ~ $6400 USD for you to be in a net gain position after a year.

With Coinbase you don't own the private keys - they do. So you need to create your own wallet on your phone or desktop system or offline by printing a paper wallet. Then you need to login to Coinbase and do a btc withdraw to an address from your new wallet. 
There are good and not so good wallets. Have a look at bitcoin.org for suggestions. I've used Electrum for years and it's considered one of the better ones. Mycelium and Copay on mobile phones are also well reputed. And there's many more. 
Whichever way you go make sure you write down and safely store your backup "seed" words provided at wallet creation time - that is critical and the only way you can recover a lost/corrupted wallet. And be aware once you take this step **only you** are responsible for wallet security not Coinbase or some other entity. You are literally your own bank.

When two (or more) blocks are created near the same time and broadcast it can happen that part of the network adds one block and part adds the other block. This can stand as is until a new block is found. This next block will have been built on top of one of the two (or more) versions previously accepted by nodes. When added to the blockchain it becomes the longest chain on the network. The nodes that had accepted the other previous block now recognize they have the shorter chain and do a re-org to step back and accept the other previous block and add this current block so that the whole network now is using the same longer chain. It's possible to take more than one block to make this determination and switch but it's rare to take more than two. When a re-org occurs the block that gets discarded in favour of the longer chain is called an "orphan".
Generally most txs end up in both blocks causing the temporary split but not always. It can happen that some txs don't end up on one chain until later. This can cause some txs to appear to be "booted out" and become unconfirmed again on some nodes for a while. As long as the txs are valid (and include an adequate fee) they will end up back in a block as the chain continues. This can cause temporarily what may look like a double spend until it's resolved. It may open up a time when two txs that spend the same coin could end up on the split chains but when the correct (longer) chain is accepted network wide one of the txs will end up dropped.
What is normally called a double spend is when a sender purposefully tries to trick a receiver by sending two txs that spend the same coin to different parts of the network at once (maybe even trying to block out some local nodes due to timing differences). In this case nodes will usually only accept the first one they see and miners may mine one or the other depending on which they see. Eventually this gets resolved as the longer chain can only contain one tx spending a coin. The issue is that a seller (pmt receiver) may have seen the first tx and not the other and based it's decision about pmt on that info. Later the pmt may appear reversed because the other tx ended up being in the longer chain. 
A double spend is not possible (long term) but may appear temporarily for some parts of the network including a seller's node. That is why it is unsafe to accept zero confirmation txs and for larger amounts best to wait for several confirmations. Large pmt processors try to mitigate this by monitoring nodes widely spread on the network to detect any attempts to send conflicting txs doing this and marking them as problems and requiring more confirmations. The same goes for RBF txs seen since until confirmed it's not sure which tx will end up in a block.

I'll give you a scientific non-answer - it's going to depend on the volatility of the ink, the absorption of the paper and the sensitivity of the detection device. It's probably possible but probably very unlikely and I'd guess very expensive to analyze and detect. If this worries you perhaps you should put your backup key in an envelope. If they find that then they'll have the key anyway.

Each line represents a given fee rate. The ones with notches in them are where new blocks are "consuming" transactions. You can see 2 blocks ago some 40 sat/b txs got confirmed (the block cuts down into a given fee line). As the txs get confirmed the notches go down deeper into lower fee rate txs waiting. Eventually it will get down into the blue and low fee txs get confirmed. Of course, to balance this new txs are been sent and too many to fit in blocks will push the rate back up again. This chart is handy for seeing what the trend is for any recent time span and judging what fee to use. As you move the mouse the floating fee table tells you how many txs were waiting at that time for each rate.

If you can't upgrade to get fork detection then set your server manually to be sure you get reliable data. It sounds like electrum will reject the other chain after the split, so this may just be extra cautious.

If that's the case you simply check the address online. You don't need the key for that and lose no security. If you want ongoing monitoring then install Electrum, create an "import wallet" and paste any addresses you have there. It will give you a watch-only wallet showing tx history and balance of all those addresses. There is no risk there because the keys are safely offline.
If you don't already have a paper wallet I'd recommend you create an offline HD wallet and use the seed words as the paper wallet. Copy the xpub (master public key) to an online Electrum as your watch-only wallet. This allows having unlimited addresses for better privacy without ever risking exposure of the keys.

One aspect you're probably missing is the privacy issues. Most governments seem to be hell bent on removing cash and making every cent traceable in a digital economy. In that future where privacy no longer exists, how can people transact without being spied on? 
Bitcoin has some ways to go but LN is pretty good already. I guess if you trust your government to define your freedoms then you'll be peachy with it. These things have a way of creeping up. First, you remove cash, then some parts of society petition for restrictions. The majority rules and you no longer have any choice. Bitcoin is a hedge against loss of privacy and freedom. I believe that will be valuable to a lot of people around the world in the future.

There is nothing to associate your name if you never gave it out obviously. The point is that info connected to one address can be associated to other addresses within your wallet by looking at trx input crossover and change outputs. It may not leak info, or it may, depending on your activity and whether you explicitly manage that.

How are you figuring it was 80 sat/b on Apr. 28th? It's hard to tell from the graph and it varies all day anyway. You have the right idea but why or why not it gets sent for a specific fee it dependent on your wallet software. Some may not give much control or not allow sending with too low a fee. 
The math is straight forward though. 223 bytes cost 418 sat so you paid 418/223 = 1.86 sat/byte. That's very low and may take a long time if the network has a lot of higher paying txs already queued. It probably didn't let you do 190 sat because that would be less than 1 sat/byte and has no chance of being confirmed now. There was a time when free txs were accepted by miners but not any more.
If the network is clogged and demanding 80 sat/byte then you would need a fee of 80*223 = 17,840 sat to be confirmed quickly. It is supply/demand based so many txs trying to get in limited block space can sometimes mean high fees. A couple years back during the block/segwit wars it did run as high as 800-1000 sat/byte. Segwit and Lightning have made significant contributions to lowering fees.

There's a few resources around about "electrum offline signing" but if you have any questions just ask. It's a popular and well known way of securing btc offline. You can use Electrum on your desktop but it's not that safe due to malware threats. 
Important: always check and be sure you use the official site for download and updates.  There is a lot of activity trying to trick users into using malicious fake software.

I'm curious how much extra disk space bitcore requires. I think an indexed full node now needs around 130GB if I'm not too out of date but I'd assume bitcore adds a db layer on top which also takes a fair bit of space. 
I'd like to compare because I wrote my own [explorer / sql db]( that runs on top of a pruning node. It's open source and free but I have not had time over the last few months to upgrade for segwit. I mean it would run on top of a BIP148 node but it doesn't store any segwit or signaling info in the sql db. It does roughly the same space as a full node but gives full sql querying, and it has a few api layers using a gevent based server. It's kind of languishing right now.

You can do it but not with regular WIF format keys as they do contain a checksum. Or if you do use WIF then you have to decode and combine keys and re-encode as WIF. If you use hex format then you can simply sum keys and encode result as WIF format for importing.
Private keys are just random numbers so combining two is just another random number, assuming whatever combining method takes into account overflow so the result is still below the max value.  
A special tool would be needed but that would be easy to write. There is a js/html page util that does this exactly using the same method as vanitygen third party key generation. It's called [chainkeys]( This is the same as done on bitaddress.org.

It will follow the fork that it was built for, ie. according to the rules it uses to validate blocks. So if you run the standard core eg. ubuntu/debian repo then you will not be on the BIP148 fork but on the legacy fork (which behaves differently; even though it has segwit it doesn't reject non-segwit blocks unless 95% of recent blocks are segwit). 
If you want to follow BIP148 (and enforce segwit blocks only) then you would have to download and run the BIP148 UASF core. There is a post here today about them just releasing version 1.0. Right now something like 13-15% of nodes are signaling or running BIP148. Those just signaling, which can be done with legacy core, need to actually download and run the real BIP148 core before Aug. 1st in order to be on that fork.

He's talking about a simplified general case at that point. In Bitcoin there is no unique id inside each tx but each tx refers to past outputs (utxo) which can only be used once and that prevents a tx from being included more than once. There is tx ids but that value is actually the hash of the tx data and not an index.

He should be happy. Cheap txs should benefit the miners with lowest electric and overhead costs. It will force off the borderline miners who are only profitable when fees are high.

I guess you can't see the actual inputs to your transaction or the byte size or the actual satoshi/byte fee rate? It sounds like you already spent twice ie. 6 in, 2 out, total 8. That means you should have a max of 4 inputs to your desired tx. So that should be less than approx. 900 bytes. If we use $9 then at $2285 that's .00394 btc or 437 sat/byte. Which, yes, is way too high. 
People are getting txs confirmed quickly for even 30-50 sat/byte now. So given you can't truly set a custom fee I'd suggest you look at moving to Electrum where you can have full control over fees, and use RBF to minimize the fee. 
The real question then is if Jaxx is BIP39 compatible and whether you can either 1) restore your backup seed in Electrum (which does support BIP39 seeds), or 2) export your private keys to import into Electrum for creating a new tx.

When you use something like localbitcoins you send your btc to your account on that site. When you open a transaction with someone the btc are locked by the site until you're paid and you release them to the buyer. If you don't get paid then the site releases them back to you. 
The scam occurs when you get paid and release the btc and then next month the buyer files a paypal complaint saying they never received the goods, or they didn't authorize the payment (account hack) and paypal takes the money back from you.

Making the ASIC simple works when the algorithm is memory bound. You want an algorithm where it doesn't even matter if the ASIC is 10nm or 45nm because it's the memory that determines performance and cost. I thought ETH with it's DAG/Hash interdependence did reasonably well at that but probably didn't reduce the complexity enough. The trick is making sure that memory cannot be replaced by algorithm optimization. 
In this situation the race would be to make more dense cheaper memory but that is something that is already pushed to the limits of viability by many of the biggest memory fabs - Samsung, Micron etc. and mining will always be a small part of their business.
I'd even go so far as to say you want complexity so low you can replace GPUs with FPGAs - better power efficiency and every tom dick and harry can design, build and sell boards with an FPGA+memory combo. The right algorithm will optimize to that sweet spot. Anything done in the FPGA can be replaced by an ASIC but the gain should not be worth the dev costs because it's the memory that equals rewards.

Do not use that seed phrase for real money once it has been entered online. Create a new one.
It probably isn't showing the correct address on iancoleman due to derivation path settings. You can choose those from various options there. That path depends on what kind of wallet you created on Ledger, eg. legacy, segwit compatible, segwit native etc. I don't know off hand what path Ledger uses so you should check that on their web FAQ info and then use that in iancoleman. 
Also, no need to generate many addresses. If it doesn't have the exact same first address in list (index 0) then it will never have any matching ones. It either has same derivation path, same addresses or not.

Personally, I want to see SegWit (more efficient blocks with incentives) first. Then I'd really like to see some Lightning network activate and get to try using that - it could offer better privacy options I'd value (and I'd like to run a LN node, experimentally). I'd like to integrate LN into Electrum (maybe as a plugin). And if that still doesn't or eventually won't provide enough relief then we'd increase block size or reduce block time (difficulty). 
@_date: 2015-02-11 09:07:03
Yes, to all questions. Except Electrum creates new keys as old ones are used and manually creating them is doable but only with console cmds as it's considered an unusual usage (you'll hear the term "gap limit" perhaps, which refers to how many unused keys are always kept available).
You can still do this within Electrum by creating a "spend" in Electrum to the first address in your receive list. It will then send from the available balance (the imported key) into your "native" key, which is under the sole control of Electrum (it's generated from your seed). You will have to make the trx for a tiny amount less than total to allow for trx fee (or set no fee but risk it taking a long time to confirm). The "!" key in send amount field should set remaining balance. Once you see the balance is confirmed on the native receive address you can delete the imported key to tidy up, or let stay if it doesn't bother you.

You haven't really given enough info to get detailed help. Assuming you are booting tails off a usb stick and that you didn't enable any permanent storage (because otherwise you'd have no problem), then you may be able to search the usb stick for the electrum file. A good first step would be to image the stick so you can work with that. From a linux terminal, insert usb stick and find device name,
    fdisk -l
Image the stick, (where X represents actual device name),
   
    dd if=/dev/sdX of=tails.img
Now you can attempt to scan that file for any remnants of the wallet file.
A simple way to scan is,
    grep -a "seed" tails.img
If that dumps a bunch of text then look for the quoted string right after the word "seed". That is the encrypted (or not, if you didn't add a password) seed value.

Did you see my edited add-on? There are no balances on the blockchain at all. There are no wallets on the blockchain. There are no users. Only transactions (and self-integrity data).
A utxo is simply a tx_id and output number. eg. 0,1,2,3.... It simply specifies a previous tx output point. I'm not sure of the exact chainstate data record format but I expect they store the output amount as well since that value may otherwise have been pruned.
When a tx is created it *consumes* previous outputs and *creates* new outputs. 
From the blockchain data perspective that is all there is (besides signatures, some overhead hashes and merkle tree - all for integrity). When an output is consumed it cannot be used again so it is removed from the chainstate. New outputs are added to the chainstate. The chainstate represents the result state of every tx in history. It's growth is an important metric in resource usage of the blockchain.

If the chain splits and you own btc before that and you handle the btc correctly you should have btc on both chains. However, nothing comes for free - if the chain splits you should expect the market to value each one according to demand and who knows what that will be and how quickly it will find equilibrium. eg. as a wild guess you might see UASF btc worth 80% pre-split and legacy worth 30% (wishful thinking no doubt). So for some time there will be volatility as people react - you could win or lose depending on when you buy/sell. 
If you don't handle transactions correctly after the split you could lose btc in replay attacks and be worse off given each chain may re-value wildly. Your best bet is to just **hodl** and not try to game the market.

My understanding is that since segwit2x accepts segwit txs it is compatible with BIP148. So if it activates first then BIP148 won't cause a fork and if there is a fork it will be between November and early 2018 when the 2x component of that is enforced by btc1 clients. Assuming btc1 clients get rolled out and are run by users, which I suspect to be doubtful. I guess we'll see.

You probably have a lot of small inputs to your tx. Did you collect faucet btc or other small amounts over time? If so the cheapest tx you can make will be to spend an amount using only the larger value outputs in your wallet. Also, some wallets don't provide good fee control. Low, medium, high doesn't really give you much control when even the lowest setting is too high. In that case you might explore restoring the wallet seed in a better wallet.
It would help if you said which wallet you're using.

The passphrase is more suited to delaying theft when the seed becomes exposed. It gives time to move funds if you realize the seed is compromised. It does have PBKDF2 hardening so brute forcing is not as fast as, say, aes alone. And the deniability aspect could be very useful in some cases.

If these are single private keys then change to a BIP39 based solution allowing backup with just a list of 12-24 words. You can easily stamp/encode the words in titanium or stainless steel [metal](
Note that you can and should use a passphrase. This would mean someone finding the word list would have to brute force the passphrase to access the actual keys. It also allows having a decoy wallet.
You can create a BIP39 seed word list offline with dice (if desired) but in order to generate addresses you need to use an air-gapped offline system ([electrum]( [iancoleman]( tool, etc) or [hw wallet](

If it gives an error when you try to broadcast then it likely wasn't sent. Or, you need to provide more details for help.
For one, what do you mean "from one of my addreses... to the same public key"? You cannot send btc to a public key, only an address. Do you mean from one address to another address within your wallet? If so, then there's nothing wrong with that. Check the address on a block explorer to see if any txs show up and the status.

You can use the blockchain.info api, or other similar ones. 
    
    
Or if you want to monitor them ongoing in one wallet you can use **Electrum** to create a watch-only wallet with those addresses. You select File, New and Restore then paste in the list of addresses. It creates a watch-only wallet with those addresses present and will show any trx with them and an overall balance.
I don't think this works from the cmd line with a file but you could likely make a short python script that would create a wallet file from a csv list. The wallet  format is json and fairly simple.

You can store them like that but you can't securely transact with them like that unless you have an offline system or make a usb boot stick. So better than making an encrypted usb is making a boot stick with wallet software and having the wallet file encrypted. It's still more hassle than a hw wallet.
You can store btc as seed words on paper. The main purpose of a hw wallet is to make transacting with them both easy and secure.

I think the cryptosteel and others are probably fine in a real world case. Most likely they wouldn't be in the hottest spot during a fire and certainly not as hot as in that test. Apparently near the floor in a fire it may be ~100C. So if placing a safe I'd just suggest under the floor, basements, away from accelerants; that gives you best chance of never nearing extremes. I mostly chose Titanium because it sounds so cool and was cheap, besides having good heat/corrosion properties.

If it starts with 5...  then it's a non-encrypted private key. You should be able to spend from that using a "sweep" function on most wallets. Just be sure to use a secure system as any malware present could grab the btc.
I'm not sure what the password is for but perhaps for a wallet file. Anyway if it were encrypted it almost certainly would not start with a 5... If you've already tried sweeping it and it says invalid then I don't know why. 
Do not enter that key into any web site as it's so easy to be intercepted and stolen.

The way you do this depends on two things. How much btc you are talking about and how much tech skills you have.
For small amounts of btc (like a few hundred $$ or less) you should probably just create a wallet using an app on your phone or desktop using Electrum. That will give you an address and you can send to that. It's not totally safe but it's easy - no real skills needed.
If you have more skill you can create an offline wallet using Electrum. This is secure as long as offline signing is used. You would need to create a linux usb boot stick or use an old laptop/system not connected to the net and install Electrum on that. There is more steps here but some good tutorials on offline signing with Electrum can help. This requires reading up and figuring out.
Finally, if tech skills are weak and/or amount of btc is significant then your best bet is to buy a hardware wallet and use that (suggest Trezor or Ledger as both have proven track records). It is easy to setup and use with a web interface or with Electrum. The important thing is the keys are kept in the device, safe from any online malware. You still make a "seed word" backup on paper, just like Electrum, or mobile phone wallets and regardless of any of these options you need to keep the seed safely stored. The seed is critical because it is used to generate keys as needed for spending/receiving.
As for addresses and the blockchain - when you create a transaction it will have the "pay to" address in it. That is what tells the blockchain where those btc are stored. It does not need to have that info until then. When you go to spend later your wallet will sign the spend with the key for that address and make another valid tx. When it is broadcast it is at that time that nodes will check for your past tx address and confirm the validity allowing spending. Until a transaction is sent the addresses only exist in your wallet as created by your software. They don't exist anywhere else nor do they need approval. It's basically all done with huge random numbers and cryptographic math.

Yes. It treats each alphabet as ordinal values so mathematically the first alphabet symbol is 0. This has the odd side effect of the first digit being dropped like leading zeros are when doing math. I've noticed but not found a workaround for values that start with the leading alphabet digit. This is the same method used in bitcoin base58 conversion and they count leading zeros and pad them as 1s on the result, so possibly that may work but as a numeric value it doesn't.
@_date: 2019-05-21 01:55:36
No. When you created the wallet you wrote down a seed word list as backup. If you didn't do that then your btc were always at risk of loss due to random circumstances like loss/theft/corruption of your wallet. Typically you would use that to restore the wallet. This may show up as "restore backup" or some such wording in the software. I would suggest reading FAQ or docs for greenaddress as I don't know specific details for that software. 
Just be sure to never type your seed words into any web site or online service as that is very unsafe.
@_date: 2018-12-17 09:14:00
You'll need more clues than that. Did you mine to a pool like BTCGuild or some other one? If so, maybe the pwd was to login there. If you have a long multi-section number with the pwd then it may have been an early blockchain.info wallet. Otherwise you would have installed software and will need more than a pwd for access. Any wallet like that will need a file as well unless what you actually have is a 12 or 24 word seed list. That would be enough for recovery with Electrum. Does anything mentioned ring a bell?

Having your own wallet doesn't make the process longer at all. You just provide your wallet address for paychecks and they go to your wallet instead of Coinbase. Now when you go to send to your bank you'd first send to an exchange (Coinbase) and withdraw to bank.
If you aren't holding btc for long and just cash out then it doesn't matter much holding it on Coinbase. But if you are also accumulating btc then it's better to hold in your own wallet. 
Coinbase has  a history of locking user btc/fiat for "investigations". Many posts here about that over time. If you are 100% sure your employer will never be in a suspicious position then I guess you have low risk. But if there's even a slight chance of dealing with suspect btc then be aware you could end up having funds held until things get smoothed out. That can take many months.

Unconformed means the transaction has been broadcast to and seen by the network but is waiting in queue to be included in a block. Miners will validate the transaction and include it in a block that then becomes accepted by nodes on the network. The queue is not simply first-come first-served but depends on each miner's choice of whether to include it. Usually the main factor is fee amount and size but other indicators play into this. 
Generally speaking an unconfirmed transaction will get confirmed within a short random time and the best course is to just wait.

Ideally you would do the process offline. 
Boot from a LiveOS of some sort, eg. Tails. Clone the [github page]( (because that gives better assurance it's not corrupted). Disconnect from the net and open the local page (file) in a browser. Generate your keys and save securely offline - either write down, print or copy to a usb stick, but make sure you have redundant copies. Shut down without re-connecting to the net (if malware got your keys it will not be able to send them out).
Briefly, in a terminal window (any debian based linux OS, eg. Tails, Ubuntu, Raspian, Mint etc).

I'm not sure what you mena by "hidden patterns" and "layers" in an image. It could range from fairly robust to downright easy to extract. If you don't have a strong background in this stuff I'd recommend using existing steganography tools that are well designed to hide data, any data, in images. And certainly data should be encrypted before hiding in an image. Without that it's almost guaranteed that someone with image processing smarts can extract the data. Not me though. But beyond that the main issue here is that you need to use an air-gapped system to plant the data in the image and then securely wipe it after.

Better to post this in but anyway I suspect you have a native segwit wallet with bech32 addresses (bc1...). That's fine (cutting edge) but some companies like Bitpay are ancient (and not supporting newer standards) and cannot handle them.
Your best bet is to make a second wallet in Electrum with legacy addresses (either p2pkh or p2pkh-p2sh choice when creating) and then send pmt there. You can then send on to your normal wallet. Unfortunately this means two txs instead of one so may be good to wait until fees are lower again.
All of the best exchanges and pmt processors are upgrading to support bech32 addresses. Bitpay is well known as anti-progressive and even anti-bitcoin due to their ownership by Bitmain (who attacked Bitcoin in past by supporting altcoins).

A public key is generated from the private key. It is 1:1 (it is done using an EC multiply - privkey * generator pt = pubkey, but an EC multiply is *special*)
An address is pubkey hashed twice with sha256 and once with ripemd-160 (and base converted). This means public key to address maps, 256:160 (less addresses than keys, some collisions).
Nowadays usually private keys are generated from seed values via hashing and math. So one seed gives you many private keys in a series. Seeds are usually random values, 128 or 256 bits, though they could be created in other ways like hashing data.
So:  seed -&gt; privkeys -&gt; pubkeys -&gt; addresses.

We could make a p2p network between electrum clients and servers. So at least when addresses get to a server it's not known where they orginate. So essentially make electrum clients behave like Bitcoin nodes with a protocol that allows passing along address/trx info. 
It could be a plugin that those wanting more privacy could enable. Also, a standalone relay/proxy node could be made for those not wanting to run/expose their wallet 24/7.
Another option is just running through an ssh socks proxy in some other country. Just having some other IP on the end, while not perfect, will obscure traffic.
@_date: 2015-02-28 13:26:11
You can take your random words and hash them to get a 256 hex value and then plug that into the word encoder function of Electrum. But that would give you 24 words as it's 12 for 128 bits. Anyway, this isn't nearly as good as just generating a random value and encoding that as words (the same way). So, in short, the old 1.9.8 version word encoder can be run as a cmd line tool independently.

That msg indicates that Bitcoin is not properly installed on the system, or at least it is not in the system path so you cannot type it from the command line. If you are sure you have it installed, eg. you can open it from the menu or shortcut, then you need to find where it is installed so you can give the full path when running it.
Alternatively, you might try copy/pasting a working shortcut or menu item and editing it to have the -rescan option. Then use the shortcut to start it.

The fee is optional and you can pay no fee if you don't mind waiting. But also, even when paying I've regularly sent about $200 for a fee of 0.24 cents (a quarter of a cent). So you're obviously including too high a fee. I use Electrum and checking right now, it's suggesting a fee of 0.1 mbtc.

This method could maybe be used for handling estate planning. You give keys/address to each beneficiary and then pre-sign trx splitting out your holdings. Store the trx safely with your will / attorney with simple pushtx url instructions for use after death. Maybe encrypt with password to a third party or something. Just a way to simplify execution that doesn't allow for alteration. Even the lawyer fees could be built in, though the value in btc would need to be agreed before hand. The trx could be printed as QR url code making it easy to scan and execute even from a phone.

BIP39 only has one word list (per language) afaik. It's not a perfect standard but it's about as good as we have currently. Most wallets seem to be supporting it.
You can use a passphrase with BIP39. That gives you a natural 2FA. You have to have the seed words and know the passphrase. If someone finds the seed words they still have to brute force the passphrase. If you make it something you can remember but not dictionary words it can be secure.
You can also go one level higher in security by using BIP39 with multisig. Then you need two independent seed+passphrase to sign a tx and they should be stored in different locations.
It's important to not get too complicated as it's surprisingly easy to forget stuff when you haven't been thinking of it for years. You may want to plan a multisig setup to allow for inheritance.
You can also split the seed words using SSS (shamir secret sharing). Each portion has to be combined with m-of-n others and is useless on it's own (unlike simple word splits they don't aid brute forcing) but you lose the ease of writing down as the split parts are binary/hex data. I've often thought we should have a standard defined for encoding sss parts as words.

Not entirely true. If the same subverted wallet is installed both online and offline and has cooperative code then the offline one can embed a seed as hex in a tx that gets detected by the online one and stolen. Not at all hard to code that.

As long as you trust your phone to be secure. I'd suggest making sure it's BIP39 compatible. Mycelium is and most are now. Then you can restore it later on other wallets like Electrum or enter it in a hw wallet if later desired for easy spending. 
Also I'd suggest saving the **xpub** (most good wallets have that available in info/details somewhere, or QR code). You can then use Electrum (or some other wallets also) and restore from xpub to have a watch-only wallet. That's one you can monitor balance and create new addresses (for more deposits) but because it doesn't have the seed it's impossible to spend from. 
Keep the seed safe as that is the only way to get your btc back. Good idea to secure it in more than one location in case of fire or other loss.
Finally, when creating the wallet most BIP39 ones support using a passphrase to extend the seed. This allow 2 factor security - you must have the seed but also know the passphrase. This make exposing the paper wallet less of an issue (passphrase can still be brute forced with enough resources).

Oh, I would note something else about this scheme. It really only protects you when the device you receive has the original bootloader. If the device is intercepted and programmed with a malicious bootloader before you receive it then it presumably could behave very differently while showing screen info to cloak that. For example, it could generate seeds using an algorithm not truly random, and do fake upgrades that report the hash but don't actually upgrade. There is a higher memory version of the same chip which could aid in this and I think I recall the wallet.fail guys looking into this, or someone did anyway (now a bit vague). It is best to ensure you get a legit original device from mfr. rather than some untrusted seller, or maybe compile and program the device yourself (it is open source and that is feasible, though likely outside most users ability).

Bitcoin core keeps a database called the "chainstate" which is all the utxos (unspent transaction outputs). These are all the valid inputs to any new txs. So it can just check the tx inputs are valid there quite quickly. The chainstate is currently around 3GB in size.

There should be some reason for the DAC to be a DAC. ie. it should generate a random number that cannot be faked because it is composite from all the shareholders/nodes in the DAC, and mathematically offers a provable guarantee of being incorruptible. I see little joy in demonstrating a DAC that could be easier done as an app on your phone using a camera and hashing the image.
1) Wouldn't the revenue be distributed according to rules ("articles") built in and accepted by anyone running/joining the DAC? Maybe I'm not very up on how this works yet.
2) I'd think better to leverage the Bitcoin blockchain if possible since it has a level of incorruptibility that can be built upon.
3) Like mining it could have "difficulty" factors that establish some equilibria - though I have no idea what shape that would take.
Hmmm. Just throwing out ideas - could it use random numbers generated on each node to select data from the btc blockchain, past blocks, that are relayed and hashed to create new randomness, once per block? The idea being that random generations can be audited but since we never know the next block contents are not predetermined.
@_date: 2019-05-30 06:18:58
If you choose your own words and then hash them then you are using a "brainwallet". That is the reverese of how common HD wallets work and is far less secure.
Current HD wallets choose a random number and then encode that value as words using 11 bits per word (2048 word list). Using a random value is important for security as it increases the work required to brute force your seed. If you choose your own non-random words then typically that contains less entropy and is far easier to guess (brute-force).
Now if you don't care about compatibility with wallets then you could come up with your own 2048 words list and replace your wallets one and use that. I thought about doing this with curse/rude words for fun. That is just as safe but non-compatible with wallets not having the word list. in that case you need to store the word list as well as seed.

Typically, average users are not going to be "supporting" the network in the way that requires a full node.

I'd also note I think core devs are taking the wrong approach to pruning, but tbh it's a bit hard to figure out what the plan is, so I'm probably ranting in the dark here. I keep hearing about pruning outputs but that's not what should be pruned. It's script data that is huge and should be pruned, and outputs kept. Maybe that's the plan and people just keep referring to it wrongly. I've been scratching my head about why outputs would be pruned when script data is the largest portion and only verified once (other then recent blocks obviously).

Trust, yes, to some extent. But what other easier ways are there to gain full blockchain access without having to download the whole thing? I'm not aware of anyone out there who shares it such that you could start up and access it randomly as needed. Also, my intention was to work out some way you could actually trust the shared data to some high degree, perhaps based on a merkle tree of the "bricks" in the gluster filesystem. Well, to the extent that you can trust anything sitting on a server 500 miles away in a data center.

I punch a small legend on the top of the piece to remind me. It's a very simple 1-2 dot pattern that indicates letter order. [Here's a template]( showing the dots legend top left. [Full SVG Template.]( allows storing 4 letters per line, 12 words per side. You can get double letters but they are just the 3-dot overlay of each letter. I put a double dot top right to use as side indicator. Punch one or two dots for side one or two. 
So you just print this, add pencil marks for your words and tape it on a metal plate. Then use it to punch the pattern into the metal and remove the paper.
[Here's a 4 line test]( I did on aluminum. You can read it by aligning the alphabet written/printed on paper along each dot line and reading back the letters in order. I think if I see the card later I'll be able to "figure it out logically" even with a foggy vague memory.
You can scramble the alphabet as well to create obfuscation of dot meaning but that would require remembering or saving the alphabet. I did think of a simple way of remembering a scramble done by rotation in sequence of the letters in a word. I think that may be too much to remember long term and I'd always have a BIP39 passphrase anyway so someone else decoding the seed words is not an immediate loss.

You may also want to google BIP38 keys. That's a paper wallet with a password that uses encryption and scrypt hashing to make it very hard to brute force. BIP38 keys require a password and the key to be used, and you could go one step further by splitting the BIP38 key in two. Then you need both key halves and a password. With BIP38 the password can be reasonably short due to the scrypt hardening whereas most wallets use only AES encryption which can be brute forced more easily, and hence should have much longer passwords.
Answering your question, there is absolutely no need to store the public address except for convenience. You can always get the address from the key but if you don't want to enter the key into some tool for deriving it then having the address as a QR code or text is more easy and direct.

The main issues are privacy and errors during sweeping. 
You lose privacy because you only have one address so if you need to add more btc later it will be to same address or you need to make another wallet. This associates the addresses (leaks info that may give away ownership info depending on how btc aquired).
The problem with spending later is you need to sweep the whole wallet at once and do it on a secure system. If you just sweep it on your desktop you put the btc at risk. If you spend only partial amounts you risk not handling the change output correctly. Advanced users don't have much of a problem but for noobs or long term storage where you may forget details like this later it has often led to errors. We used to see people posting about making these mistakes. I'm not sure if people are getting better or less people are using single keys. Anyway, there are some posts around with more detailed explanations. I don't have a bookmark but maybe others will post.

Thank You Lopp for your tests. 
I'm very happy to see the center punch method is robust and readable after tests. I have one of the spring loaded center punches ($3) and so only needed to order a small piece of titanium off ebay ($2). I came up with my own dot coding method that is much more compact. It can store a 24 word seed on two sides, credit card size. I posted some images elsewhere here a couple weeks ago. (again below)
I haven't done it yet but my plan is to glue printed material on each side to make a programmers reference card to hide the dots so it's not even obvious it's a seed. Or periodic table, or boy scout knots.

You don't need to change the code. Those lines are constants for sec256k1 curve.
Assuming you have python (usually preinstalled on linux but a manual install on Windows) then, at command line, you can just run the script with some args. Here is an example of how to do that.
Put a line with chars in a text file, eg. `char.txt` containing:
`q w e r t y a s d f g z x c v b`
Run the command with your BIP38 key, eg.
`python pwscanx char.txt 6PYVGsMgpQw1uEe2ymbmX84fnvbtGbQUGNMn6uxz7kMyAcDUD4imEfuZPB`
Note that is a test BIP38 key just created with pwd `qwer` so if you test run that it should find the pwd ~~right away~~ as confirmation it works.  edit - not right away. Just tested here and slow because does 2 and 3 char test before 4 char. Unfortunately it doesn't currently show progress. I should add a line to give some runtime feedback.
If you just run `python pwscanx` then it will spit out help info. If you need more help with how to do on windows just pm me. I'd suggest if not a linux user then making a [linux usb boot stick]( and running it there may be easier. Depends on tech skill level.

A public key can always be generated from any private key using an EC multiply operation. A private key is simply a random number - nothing more (though randomness quality is critical). A deterministic seed is simply a starting point for generating a sequence of random numbers and has no bearing on public keys. 
You can generate a sequence of public keys independently from private keys. That is, from a seed you can generate a sequence of public keys without having to first generate the private keys. Which is why watch-only deterministic wallets can work.

 Write down and keep your seed words safe.
 Realize that if you have the seed on your desktop even though it's encrypted a virus/keylogger can still gain access to your funds. So with more than small amounts you should familiarize with using two wallet files - one for spending on desktop, and one offline for savings, that uses the MPK and offline signing strategy. 
This sounds complicated at first but once you've done it a couple times it's actually pretty easy. And cheap enough if you use a Raspberry Pi, or USB boot stick, as offline wallet.

It is a joke in the sense that the site is pointless. Private keys are just random numbers so any number at all is a valid key (excluding a very small range near the gen pt)  - you don't need a site to provide keys, you can make them up yourself about a million times faster than fetching a web page. That's why people are saying it's joke. eg. the number 42 is a valid private key, with address 1QAALUJNskZWEbvwKXoTteowgs9xGGeAZR.
**edit:** just to clarify, you need to get the formatting right. 
So 42 needs to be formatted as 64 digit with leading zeros, eg.
formatted in WIF is,
which produces address,
However, if you use 42 decimal you get, 2A hex, or,
5HpHagT65TZzG1PH3CSu63k8DbpvD8s5ip4nEB3kEsreFMSs18A 
in WIF and address,
You can increment from there and produce keys and check addresses for coins as fast as you can query the blockchain.

This happens quite often. When a new block is found some miners will mine an empty block until they have verified the last one and built a new one. Besides that, it is valid to mine an empty block. It's just not most profitable because no tx fees are collected. You'll notice that block is less than a minute from it's previous. Once the miner builds a new block it will switch to that in preference of getting fees.

Your thousands of IPs doesn't matter except to you. Just because you have lots of IPs is not going to change the consensus rules of the other nodes on the network. They will drop your txs if they do not validate with their rules. 
The only situation might be some nodes cannot talk to other nodes except yours and you can "starve" them of txs. They might notice they cannot get txs and blocks that match their rules, their chain is dead, and start looking for ways to get reconnected beyond your malicious node. In fact, I'm fairly sure you get banned by them for providing too many bad txs and they would look for peers that provide txs they can validate.
Your node would end up building a different chain than the nodes not accepting your consensus rules. You would essentially create your own chain that may appear to have thousands of nodes but which in fact only has one real node.
The main point being that your ability to spin up nodes does not take away others ability to continue to run their own consensus rules. And a miner does not have that ability either. They can mine with their own rules that only one part of the network will validate, but that doesn't force the remainder to accept them. You end up with a hard fork. A fork with one node of a thousand IPs, and a fork with the rest of the nodes which will no longer be talking to you.

afaik the key data is stored in internal flash of the cpu and that is protected by an irreversible fuse set during boot loader flashing. Now if there is a 0-day on that chip fuse protection or if you have an electron microscope then maybe you can read it without wiping and re-flashing but definitely not by just probing the chip (whether removed or not). If it were possible then I'm absolutely sure the wallet.fail guys would have done it before resorting to the glitching attack. They aren't retards.

If you get the right key for the address you sent to, then yes. Bitcoin don't "reach" a wallet. They always exist as outputs on the blockchain. A wallet simply holds keys and looks at the blockchain to get info. So when you eventually get that key into a working wallet it will generate the address from the key and use that to query the blockchain to get the "output" that has your btc. It uses all relevant "outputs" to give you a wallet history and balance. 
Electrum is a good wallet but running it on your Windows desktop makes it vulnerable to any malware/viruses you get. A better choice is to use Electrum on a usb linux boot stick or with a hardware wallet for safe keeping. It kind of depends on how much btc you have and how much you'd miss it if lost. With your own Bitcoin wallet YOU are the one responsible for security. There will be no one to turn to if they get hacked.

I'm not suggesting anyone should make a brain wallet using this method and that's not what Electrum does either. Generating a random value and encoding it as a mnemonic is not what is usually called a brain wallet, and has no less entropy than writing it down as hex digits. Though, you can still remember it like a brain wallet.

A price drop on one exchange can only transmit to other exchanges by way of the coins being bought and transferred out. Otherwise the selling action only affects the exchange it happens on. ie. arbitrage is needed to relay the price action and that requires buying the cheaper coins and selling them on the other exchange.

There is some debate. The ones not full open source usually only keep secret some parts required like the "secure enclave" chip. There is merit in that as the chip may have a higher barrier to tampering and secret extraction. If the supervising controller is open source then I think you can check and trust keys aren't leaked. For me, I decided to stick with full open and I wouldn't suggest using one that isn't at least "almost" fully open and having not been fully reviewed by the community over the years.

The only argument I know is that the market expects a rise and gets over bought. So on the halving any rise will be reason to sell into and take profits. But in my opinion that is only a temporary sell as over following months the lower new supply will be felt and eventually be reflected in price. So I'm looking for a lot of volatility near the halving and then gradual steady rise some time later.

Electrum uses their own different seed standard so if you have a native wallet (one created in Electrum) then you cannot restore it directly on the Trezor. 
If you previously created the seed in another BIP39 compatible wallet and restored it in Electrum then you can restore it in Trezor.
Either way you can setup your Trezor with a new seed and send a Max spend (click Max on send tab) to send all btc over to the new wallet address. This is recommended anyway as it is more sure that your seed has in fact 100% never been leaked. Only downside is fees are high right now so you may want to wait til they drop.
Whatever choice you probably will need to upgrade Electrum. Make sure you only ever do that from the official site,  - there are many scam/phishing sites around and people do get burned by using the wrong one.

afaik even back in 2010 the WIF format was the same. 51 chars starting with 5. Other variants are clearly different, eg. BIP38, mini-key formats.
The only thing left is that a character was written down incorrectly, or the checksum was computed incorrectly (that is how it tests validity if not a char set error). Or an error was made when converting and printing (if not hand written). 
I'd suggest entering in Electrum sweep and then going thru and altering char by char to values that may be similar, eg. 5 or S, but only one change at a time. If the correct value occurs the sweep button should enable.
The last option would be manually converting back to hexadecimal removing the checksum and recomputing. I have a [keyfmt utility]( that could help (maybe with some small changes). That utility can convert and output various info about the key. It has code for doing the base58 conversion and chksum. Almost any key value is valid if the checksum is removed but only the checksum indicates an error. (Newer bech32 has better error checking/correcting).

If you have had holdings on bfx then one way to get them out easily is to buy btc and withdraw. That drives up the btc price there. Normally that price increase would be arbitraged away to other exchanges but to do that you have to trust you can withdraw usd/fiat from the exchange. If something goes wrong you could be stuck with your fiat seized/tied up. Apparently traders aren't happy to risk that right now as otherwise that $400 bonus would be taken as profit by them.
Arbitrage between exchanges is what keeps prices somewhat close across them. When the prices aren't close there is always some reason traders aren't picking up the easy money. Usually risk or transfer costs/time.

You've got a couple things mixed up together.
Yes, Lightning is a second layer but it requires the internet to function. As of now there is no second layer that could work without at least some regional network between it's users. It may allow transacting without the bitcoin network to some local/regional extent but no one could deposit or withdraw btc from the Lightning network - something that needs to happen eventually for Lightning transactions to have any monetary meaning.
On a different topic you can do transaction signing offline without a network connection. Those transactions can be taken to a network for broadcast. They could be stored for later or swapped between users to some small degree to the extent that the sender/receiver trust each other. But all transactions, offline or online, need to be validated on the network otherwise they are meaningless. It may not require a local internet connection because there are ways of broadcasting by radio, sms, usb stick in the mail or whatever to get the transaction to a network node. 
There is satellite broadcast of the blockchain allowing disconnected users with the right equipment to check transactions are valid. I don't think they can currently broadcast transactions that way.

I'm not sure the problem is Electrum as just general Bitcoin or HD wallet concepts and how they manifest within any wallet. Perhaps. My problem is that I have been using it for 3.5 years, do program, and have contributed code, and generally have a fairly deep knowledge of Bitcoin, so may not be the best to judge that. 
I have thought that a good beginner "Electrum for Dummies" guide would probably be good, as there are quite a few topics that are not very explicit and some things you need to dig around on the web to know about. eg. using it with Tor, or getting bitcoin urls to open properly in Electrum with your browser. 
I don't think that's a failing of the devs as they are busy enough, but maybe someone like me should write a book and publish on github like AA did for Bitcoin. I'd do that if I could afford the time without pay or fund with donations.

He says he moved caching from low-level signatures to higher txid validation. And that he extended mempool to use this, which I take to mean that it can now cache the tx validation done in the mempool such that later when it becomes confirmed he doesn't need to do it again (because he caches based on txid). At least, that's my reading of his comment.
edit: People are saying this doesn't affect scalibility but I think it does when block sizes are much larger because then the transfer times are not the bottleneck but validation times. Assuming a node will validate before relaying a block. Now, granted important nodes are going to be well connected to not have relays between anyway.

Because it was promoted and brought about by only a couple self-centered egotist actors who thought they knew best and the technical ideas they had were stupid. And I say stupid in that they were not good programmers and had little understanding of the ramifications of their changes (which would lead to more centralization). They did it anyway because they figured if they could convince some to follow them they would have their own little coin-kingdom where they are the bosses. And they do. But do you want to be playing in their sandbox or in the one that the vast majority of the crypto world plays in? 
The only saving grace for their blockchain is that since no one uses it much it hasn't grown to a hugely unmanageable size that would cripple the ability for anyone to run a node. It was analyzed recently that most txs on their network are by a few addresses and even then it's puny.

blockchain.info have had several exploits over the years that have burned some people. Take your time to learn the steps and move your btc offline. You will be glad when you read others posting about not doing it, and getting burned.
Both Ledger Nano S and Trezor are time proven and used by many here. If economy is important then Trezor One is entry level and perfectly fine. There are ways of using Electrum offline that are secure, for free. 
Either way you end up writing down the seed word list and safely storing it. Once done, it doesn't matter what happens to hardware or files etc - only that you keep those words away from prying eyes. A hw device is more convenient than Electrum offline and a better choice for non-technical users.

BIP39 does not use encryption with the passphrase. It simply hashes the passphrase into the seed algorithm to create a different seed. You get a different seed for every possible passphrase so you can have multiple passphrases for multiple wallets on the same base seed.

SSH Reverse Tunnel.
I use a BTCPay server at home and then have it connect to my VPS server using an ssh secure tunnel. That means I'm not paying for server space but it appears like it's running a full BTCPay payment processor. It's been very reliable so far as I have configured the tunnel to reconnect and stay up. Given I only expect rare bitcoin payments it's a good low-cost setup. It was pretty easy to set up too. I made a [blog post]( about the steps and configuration. I can support several different small web sites I manage with the one pmt processor interface. My blog donation page also uses it. I estimate it takes perhaps 1-2 seconds longer to serve an invoice compared to running it on the VPS but that's even given it tunnels from New York to Australia.

A fuse is a common protection in some micrcontrollers but after writing that I went to look at the datasheet for this specific mpu and I don't think that is the method it uses; or not just that. Usually a fuse is a read/write protection device that permanently prevents memory from being read or rewritten or requires a full wipe before either case. It's designed to protect copyrighted code/data. I didn't see mention of that here.
I think instead it just utilizes the bootloader to control what parts of memory can be written and to check hashes/signatures of upgrades. There is a separate doc on the upgrade process and I didn't go into that. Presumably to overwrite the bootloader would need a full wipe of flash contents. There is a MPU (memory protection unit) in the controller and that allows controlling what parts of memory are accessible by different code parts. I would expect it also protects against memory dumps by JTAG ports, which is presumably how how an external device would gain access at a debug level.
Anyway, there is no reason to detect cpu removal or power status. The cpu and flash memory (code) are integrated as one chip. When it powers up it starts executing the bootloader. Other than a JTAG port you can't access the chip memory via some probing like you might with a flash chip on it's own. The memory is accessed by code running in the chip, and that code is installed and monitored by the bootloader. In the case of the Trezor One the bootloader does the firmware upgrade and does a hash/signature test which it displays on screen. If the value does not match the one being provided by the company then it is corrupt/hacked and shouldn't be used.
Anyway, my knowledge of this is quite general from other devices I've work with and I would expect the wallet.fail guys spent a lot more time looking into the details of this specific chip and it's operation in order to come up with the specific attack they worked out. If it were as simple as just writing malware into the chip and reading out key data they would never have needed to glitch it or do anything more tricky than simple debug JTAG connections.

The passphrase is combined with seed words to generate a different series of keys for each passphrase. Use same passphrase again later, get same series of keys. It's a "deterministic" algorithm in that the same input seed+pwd always give you the same output keys. 
Once your wallet has the keys it generates addresses and looks them up on the blockchain to build a history.
The reason they suggest deleting the account is so no trace of it is left around that would tell others that you actually have that set of keys. Hence, deniable. "I have no more bitcoin".

Yes open source. I wrote [sqlchain]( in Python. That is a block processor which reads the blockchain into a mysql db. You can then use sql to any variety of queries or analysis. It has a lot of options and several API layers that can be used on top of it. My main intention with it was to create a compact sql layer because at the time I started this most other sql-blockchain parsers were taking 5-6x as much space as the blockchain. sqlchain can optionally throw away signature data and get it to half the size, plus it supports myrocks (rocksdb engine) for compressed hash optimized indexes, reading blk*.dat files directly so it can parse while bitcoind is still syncing, works with pruning nodes, allows skipping from some block height for cases where you only need new blocks. 
Anyway, even if you don't need a full sql db there is a lot of utility code and the block parser could be adapted to doing just about anything with block data. It also has a modular plugin system to support any altcoins with a few examples thrown in. It's currently python 2.7 but someday I'll get around to converting it Python 3. Not time right now. I have several web apps that I've coded on top of this for clients so it has got a fair bit of testing already. Any questions, just ask or pm if not public. I do help out users now and then but if it's a lot of my time I'd want pay.
I think much of what you need could be queried in sql but for some things you may want to adapt the schema to store some extra data as blocks are parsed.

Bitcoin core is the reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. There are alternatives but most nodes on the network are running this one in order to communicate with other nodes, to relay and to validate  txs and blocks. You can write your own and as long as you adhere to the protocol rules it will work. 
You can also use a "light" wallet which delegates the actual protocol parts to another node, which most likely is running Bitcoin core. Examples of that would be Electrum or most mobile phone wallets which don't have resources to maintain a full ledger (blockchain) and communicate directly on the Bitcoin network.

Electrum is safe but keeping that amount on your computer leaves you open to malware / hackers. If you really don't plan to use often then once you have secure paper backups of the seed words you can convert the wallet into a watch-only wallet. That way it can view your btc, tx history and still create new addresses for receiving but the wallet cannot spend btc. 
The native Electrum wallet seed is not compatible with other wallets. But Electrum does support BIP39 compatible seeds which means if you use that type of seed then there are many wallets that can restore the seed.

The main issue with a paper wallet and using bitaddress is that to do it right it's not simple. You have to prepare and use a system that will never connect to the web. Then you have to save it on paper by hand without any errors. You could use a printer but then you have to know the details of what your printer stores internally or may leak if it's ever connect to wifi or another computer later. Then you have to know how to handle a private key for sweeping later and not screw that up (as others have often done in past). Plus you give up some privacy by only having a single address for any future deposits, or you need to repeat it for more than one paper wallet.
It's generally acknowledged now that if you are going to go to the hassle of preparing an offline system for making a paper wallet you are better off using it to create a BIP39 seed word list and master public key (xpub/ypub/zpub) as your paper wallet and watch-only wallet combo. It's more flexible long term, it's easier to use, and someday if you like you can restore it on a hw wallet directly for easy offline transactions.
Of course, the simplest non-tech way to do a BIP39 seed offline is with a hw wallet from the getgo. Think of that as a paper wallet with a transaction signing device.

Yes. It runs on top of a full node. It will use rpc or direct blk file reading (optional) to build the mysql db. The mysql db will be roughly 65-70 GB and witness data about the same again (but it can be mostly dropped as generally not needed) on top of the node (unless you are pruning the node). If your node is already pruning then it would have to sync again from 0 block. 
On a decent system with fast SSD it should build the mysql table in about a week, though you can start pulling early-block queries of want you want as they are sync'd, so much sooner.
Since it uses rpc you can also run it on a 2nd system on a LAN. Probably not much gain unless your node is already heavily loaded.

Having your btc under your own control (you have the seed/private keys) is kind of the reason for Bitcoin existing so it's always a good thing regardless of a possible fork. Just be safe - make sure you write down and store your seed words securely. If you are talking about significant amounts then read up more on offline storage and/or hardware wallets.

The Trezor is so open that you can actually make your own boards and assemble yourself from off-the-shelf parts for about $25 (and a fair bit of electronics knowledge). Well, it's a double sided board so probably order from China is more fitting. I looked at that and you could get about 30 boards for $5. But the cpu is ~$15 at Mouser.com. Then you have to compile the firmware and program the cpu. Pretty nifty, and remarkable how open the business model is.

I think that's true. That's also why I decided to make it as a plug in. It will only be more advanced users who seek out and install that. It would not be something likely to ever be added into the core wallet as it's too prone to mistakes.

As someone who would like to spend btc in real life I view it as levels of goodness. 
I'm happy that more accept btc even if through a processor like Bitpay (though I dislike them, I have bought that way a few times). But I view it as much better if the vendor can setup and use an independent solution like BTCPay. 
From a practical standpoint I'd rather they accept btc thru a processor than not at all. I'd rather they used coinbase commerce (or similar, direct to wallet, no fees) than bitpay (or similar). I'd rather they had their own btc node than use a processor.

Is the proposed solution to put btc back in custodial services? I don't think so or did I miss that. I don't agree with that. **Take them out and keep them out.**
It's true for noobs and non-techies it's a bit complicated. And people have time to learn before doing it. They absolutely shouldn't rush and transfer out before they have any clue. IMO those who can read, understand and follow simple steps should take the reigns of their own btc.
It would be nice if exchanges could be audited but we went down that road years ago, briefly and it all faded away. It's not going to happen any time soon. Exchange customers aren't demanding it, and I suspect very few of them will follow thru on this new event either.

There are several kinds of addresses and Electrum supports some of them. A bc1 address is a bech32 address, now the default in Electrum. If you create a new wallet and choose "not segwit" as an option then you'll get a legacy 1... address which will be supported by Paxful. 
It's too bad Paxful isn't keeping up with Bitcoin technology as bech32 and segwit are both the preferred address types going forward. Each wallet can only have one type but if you want after sending to your 1.. (p2pkh or legacy) wallet you can send from there to your new bech32/segwit wallet. It should only cost 10 cents (approx). Sending from a bc1 address will save you some fees later.
Electrum also support BIP39 wallets which use a 3... segwit address but it cannot create by default. It would need to be created elsewhere and restored in Electrum.
Whatever wallet type you have, be sure to write down and safely store your seed words. Without them you cannot recover or restore your wallet in case of hardware failure or loss.

This is what happens with low value inputs like faucet earnings or other dust. They become more costly to spend then their own value.
If not all your inputs are low value then try again after it's dropped but exclude all low value inputs. You can do that with electrum by freezing addresses with low value outputs. This at least allows you to spend the ones that are worth more than their byte size costs.

If you use Electrum with your Ledger you can have multiple wallets, each with different passphrases open at once on screen and see addresses and history for each.

3) I believe any tx with future locktime is not relayed so you can not even broadcast. The only way to broadcast a future tx is using CLTV.
I didn't read his article so I hope it doesn't imply you can broadcast a locktime tx that will hold btc until some date/block. You cannot. The best you can do is create it and hold offline as data until that time/block for broadcast. Any other tx that uses any input in the meantime would prevent it being valid.
CLTV allows creating an address that cannot be spent from until some date/time and works in conjunction with locktime value.
Have a look at CLTV options on  to play around with this. 
I did some experimenting and started writing a plugin for CLTV in Electrum (called TimeMachine^tm). I got part way and it does locktime in plugin but I got stuck on how to push the CLTV tx in thru existing Electrum tx handler. So as of now have not finished it, though the interface and options are all there to do future txs. It cannot yet preview and broadcast the tx. I wanted to piggyback on existing code rather than write all-new tx encoding logic.

Ya, stealth means it's not responding; so not open. Either the router is not properly port forwarding or your system is still blocked, or not listening. I know how to debug this on linux but not windows. 
On linux I'd start with console command `netstat -lntp` to check that bitcoin is actually listening on the port. And then `iptables -L` to list firewall rules. Then use `nmap -Sn &lt;local ip&gt;` to port scan the machine. Some routers have awful finicky interfaces so I'd go over that carefully for dumb options you missed that may prevent it working. Be careful with from/to ports. It needs to be from port 8333 and to whatever your bitcoin port is in bitcoin.conf (by default 8333). I only mention these as perhaps you can find Windows equivalent tools.

Creating a bootable USB stick for your computer is considerably more secure. Once you have that you disconnect from the net and boot on it when you want to sign a tx. With Electrum you can keep a watch-only wallet on your normal booting system and use that to create an unsigned tx that you then boot on the secure usb stick to sign. This is nearly a zero cost option that gets you an offline wallet with only modest inconvenience for spending btc and comes very close to hardware wallet security.

Actually this is a valid concern and the simplest attack vector. Replace the entropy code with code that creates seed values from a *super-seed*. It's the same complexity as generating keys from a seed. Any device with that code will generate seeds that the attacker will know without any other connection to the device. 
But to bypass device entropy code you can (and perhaps should) [use dice rolls to generate a seed]( and then restore that on the device. It's fairly easy and as truly random as the dice chosen to roll. Users have been doing this for years but it doesn't get much publicity any more as it's seen as a little bit *tin-foil hat*.

@_date: 2018-12-01 22:34:09
A transaction has one or more inputs (that may come from one or more "wallets") and one or more outputs (that may go to one or more "wallets"). An address is not a wallet - in common usage a wallet is a collection of addresses. Often input and/or output addresses may be from the same wallet but they need not be.
You cannot definitely know which outputs are to a single wallet or back to the same wallet as the inputs. There are some clues and guess work involved.
Looking at your example there are 2 inputs and 3 outputs. The 3... and 1... addresses are likely not from the same wallet but may be owned by the same person. You have no way to know without deeper analysis of related txs. 
Wallet software randomizes the order of outputs to obfuscate which one might be change (back to original wallet). The only rule enforced by bitcoin is that the total inputs must equal the total outputs plus fee. In most cases the inputs will be from the same wallets but there are protocols like Coinjoin that allow combining inputs from multiple wallets. Mining pool payouts often involve dozens or hundreds of outputs to unrelated owners, as do btc withdrawn from an exchange.
There are hints such as the change output will likely not be larger than the smallest input otherwise that input could have been dropped and fees saved. I used to know a few more but have forgotten them over the years.
I guess the point here is that "account" and "wallet" have very vague meanings in bitcoin tx data. Neither have specific meaning in the protocol.

Ya, it means go back to the block with the bad tx and re-mine it without the tx. Then keep mining on top of that block to create a new fork. When this new fork is longer (more work) than the current one then it is the real Bitcoin by definition. 
Problem is: this is *craaazyyy talk.* Even if you could bribe most miners to do this they would be competing against the miners who aren't, it would split the community (though probably pretty heavily against it), and the thief could start spending his stolen btc as fees to counter bribe the miners to not mine the other fork. The BTC price would plummet because this goes against one of it's major value propositions. A price drop alone would counter any incentive that could be offered miners. It would be like throwing dynamite in their mines.

Ah. Ok. To do that I'd suggest writing an Ubuntu or Debian linux boot image to the usb stick, booting on it and installing Electrum. You can use that as an offline cold storage solution that works great. Just always disconnect any network cables and do not configure wifi or disable it with rfkill. 
I have used that approach for a couple years. It is likely the next best option to a hw wallet but is more complex to set up. You create your tx on a desktop Electrum that is watch-only (created with xpub from offline wallet), save to a (2nd) usb stick, boot on the linux usb, load the tx in Electrum, sign it, save again to usb, and finally open on desktop Electrum to broadcast. It sounds complicated but only takes 3-4 minutes to do a secure signing. There are more complete tutorials around and some details on electrum.org site about offline/cold signing.

If you buy one that's not from an authorized seller then you should at very minimum do a full re-install/update of the firmware before using it at all. Check that the case doesn't appear to be opened either. It may still be technically possible to have different electronics inside that fake normal firmware behavior but unlikely as no reported cases yet.

Maybe you can look at selling something online for btc? There are several avenues for selling stuff. You don't have to buy it up front or even plan on a real profit (though something to cover your time may work). Advertise on a market forum. When btc in escrow or received, buy and ship item with fiat. Or purse.io but I think that may have age requirements. Not anything shady, just stuff people may want. I saw someone looking for a Martin guitar here but no dealer takes btc.
Stores and the post office don't check age and it's evergreen - you can keep doing it once you find something in demand. I used to sell auto (car) belts online for years. There seemed to always be people wanting them. Plus you can set the exchange rate. Good business education too.

Apparently we don't have to worry about five signors going rogue but only one. It's true they could use SSS to split single keys but is that very likely?  
With SSS I doubt you can prove who combined parts to make the key whereas with multisig I think you can prove who signed and assign responsibility.
Also, I find it amusing 98% of btc (offline) is not insured. So you truly have to trust their offline is very secure. And their online btc (2%) are at least partially self-insured - how much seems unknown.

Here's a [photo]( of test I did on aluminum scrap with 4 words. Also shows the spring type center punch I used (~$3 china). Notice third line down is word with 2 pairs of same letters: 2,3 and 1,4 (tooth). Fourth line also has 1,4 combo. 
To read, you mark letters on paper edge with same spacing (3mm in my case) then use as ruler under each line. If you scramble letters then it's obfuscated somewhat (probably not hard to solve due to word list being small subset of 26^4 possible codes). But then you'd have to remember scramble method.
Can't wait for Titanium. I checked hardness and seems to be about 50% harder than aluminum. So I expect dents to be smaller.

It's been a while since I coded anything at that level but I think the nonce was only 32 bits - so it wouldn't last long nowadays. The pool can change other header values like time stamp to create different work for each miner. I'm not sure what they actually do now but I seem to recall they used to change a sequential value in the coinbase tx to also accomplish that. Also, they are always updating the tx set for a block so when new txs are added the header also changes. In principle each hash is just as likely as any other so as long as miners aren't hashing the same data they are doing useful work. Also note that the actual work given to miners is partially hashed ("midstate") already so they never have access to the actual header data (which would allow them to cheat). It's been 4 years since I last coded this stuff (for ASIC firmware) so I'm pulling this from my crappy memory. I'm pretty sure it's roughly correct but maybe not perfect, and possibly out of date.

I wouldn't recommend that 2FA method as ideal. For one, it costs money to use and you always depend on their service for signing - not a very private setup if that's what you want.
You can use your own multisig wallet setup. I did that for a couple years where my normal desktop signed once and my linux usb stick was needed to boot and separately sign as well.
IMO the best way now is to create a BIP39 seed offline (either using iancoleman or dice) and restore that into a tails/offline wallet to create the xpub. Use that on your desktop for watch-only and creating txs which you sign offline. 
The advantage I see with BIP39 is you can add a passphrase (basically 2FA in itself) and when you get more btc it will be very easy to restore in a hw wallet without even going online. A hw wallet does not add security so much as easy use, convenience. If you rarely need to transact then an offline seed is as safe.
Regardless, always keep a seed backup on paper/metal stored safely. USB sticks and other media can fail. Online backups can be accessed in secret and be brute forced.

Very briefly: big blocks means huge blockchain full of spam (malicious or useless txs) and that means it gets harder and harder to have personal nodes where you do your own validation. Without that you have to depend on central servers - that reduces decentralization - one of the key principles of a trustless censor resistant coin. 
If you want someone acting as gatekeeper to your money then by all means go use BCH. The fact they can't even fill 100k blocks shows that the world wants this feature more than big blocks, cheap fees. Heck, you may as well use Paypal in that case and not give your money to Ver Jihan &amp; Co.

You can't share the same folder simultaneously, though you can likely alternate as long as conf files are the same.
You can copy it and have two and then start each with a datadir option. If you're not pruning and that's a lot of space then on the second one you can enable pruning (eg. prune=2000) and it will discard all except the set amount MB of blocks. The chainstate still takes ~3GB.
You can also use the connect=&lt;ip&gt; option to make the second one only talk to the first. That way you don't have double the public network activity. It simply updates from your own node. You'll probably need to change the bind port too.

Often scam sites try to lure suckers into sending btc knowing it's near impossible to get found.

Probably just when it was created. Newer versions of Electrum default to native segwit to help the community advance to newer technologies. 
A segwit wallet will save you fees later when you send from it. You can have two wallets, one for each if you like. It's up to you. 
A segwit wallet can send to any address but some services are not yet able to send to native segwit addresses (bc1... addresses). I guess it depends on how often you transact. There is also segwit wallets with 3... addresses that are more compatible but don't save as much on fees.
    legacy - pk2pkh - 1...  (highest fees)
    segwit compatible - p2pkh-p2wsh - 3...  (moderate fees)

They used bitcoin-qt (core), though I think it may have not been "qt" originally. The core underlying network software always had a wallet facility. I didn't start using that until 2011 but I assume it was there from the start. You never needed a web site and you don't even now. In fact, you shouldn't use a website as a bitcoin wallet. It just opens up more ways to lose btc. Even by 2011 there was an initial blockexplorer web site. After that there was blockchain.info who created a better explorer and made a web wallet. A lot of people used that but over the years it had many failures/hacks and people lost money so it has become less desirable to use that type of wallet.
Originally txs used public keys instead of addresses (tx type P2PK instead of P2PKH common now). A layer of extra privacy and security was added when hashes of public keys started being used for addresses.

The wallet files are stored in different locations on different OS. On Windows,
    Show hidden files
    Go to \Users\&lt;YourUserName&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Local\Electrum\Wallets
You are better to rename the "default_wallet" file there to some other name for backup, rather then outright deleting.
You can just use menu item File, New/Restore to create a new wallet. You can do that without renaming/deleting the old one but then it won't be the one opened by default at start.
Electrum allows you to have multiple wallets, and even open them at the same time in different windows. Each wallet is in it's own file.

Your naivete is adorable.
Changing a few letters on a private key is not going to stop a hacker. If you change letters not near the end then the chksum at the end makes it super fast to try variations that match the chksum. If you change the chksum at end then they only need to do one trial to recompute the chksum. So either way it's a dud for security. Never invent your own security methods as you will fail against the world of hackers. 
If you are going to store something online, which I do not recommend at all, then at very least use strong encryption with a very long passphrase. But then you need to store the passphrase as it's too hard to remember (any strong password is too hard to remember long term). So you may as well just store the seed (better than a key)  in that case. 
My recommendation for a paper wallet is to use a BIP39 seed with an additional memorable but difficult passphrase. Create it offline on a system you securely wipe afterwards or use a hw wallet (easier, less error prone).
As tempting as it is don't roll your own security. It will only work if it's never attacked.

It will increase disk much more than slightly, and it doesn't do anything for censorship resistance anyway. There's no need to make most users running a node accommodate Electrum users at all.

No. To make it more compact. The others use single dots and one line per letter so the grid is 4x larger overall. By using dot combos you can fit a word on each line making it small enough for a credit card. You could probably do the same by using a 1mm grid but then you have to be super accurate. I'm using a 3mm grid which means hand placement and punching is workable while still being small overall. 
Anyone who finds it should not have much trouble decoding it with a bit of logical thinking. It would be more obvious if you laser engraved the alphabet and grid like the commercial ones. I think not showing that makes it less obvious. I have a laser engraver here but have never tried titanium. I don't know how much of a mark it would leave.

This is all good info. 
Given how crappy most people are at keeping their desktop secure it's very likely that Electrum Android is more secure for people seeking an easy, moderately secure wallet. They can always take the xpub over to the desktop and have a watch-only wallet there, and even delete the mobile wallet after safely writing down seed words. It wouldn't be my first, most secure choice but I think it's one step above simply creating a desktop wallet.

Satoshi didn't build that in. Or maybe he was involved later when the original Bitcoin proposal was revised to use pubkeyhash instead of just pubkey. In the original the pubkey was exposed in each tx even before you spend. So what you're saying here is almost the exact opposite. Let's say thanks to the work done after the white paper to improve Bitcoin and today to the continuing work still being done to extend it. Satoshi was probably involved too, I guess.

I saw you asked about how the "canary" wallet works. This is a form of plausible deniability. The ability to deny you have more bitcoin. When you add a passphrase to a BIP39 type wallet (all hw wallets I've seen) the passphrase actually is used as part of the generation algorithm for the keys. So every possible passphrase creates a different wallet (series of keys). Even the blank/empty passphrase creates a wallet.
So the idea is to put a small amount of btc on the blank passphrase wallet that people will find easily if they get hold of the seed words. And put your main stash on a wallet with a secure passphrase. If the thief takes btc he finds on the no-pwd wallet and you are monitoring it (watch-only wallet on your system, or phone) then you'll know the seed is compromised and want to move btc to a new seed before they have time for a full brute force to find other btc on other non-blank passphrases. The blank pwd wallet is a "canary" for your real wallet.
Also, since the passphrase allows creating any number of sub-wallets for different purposes on a single seed, you might create wallets for family members each having their own passphrase. This is convenient as you don't need to keep many seeds secure. You could have two passphrased wallets - one for duress situations you claim "is all I got", and another for the real hidden stash.
One thing I would warn against is making passphrases too short or easy, like using just a few dictionary words. If your seed is compromised the only defense left is difficulty of brute forcing the seed. Passphrases of less than ~10 chars or 5-6 common words are fairly easy to break. It's a fine line as ideally it also needs to be easy to remember.

I don't use this wallet but a quick google confirms it's BIP32 and BIP39 compatible. That implies all addresses generated in the wallet are always valid. You can use old addresses but it does reduce privacy. If you value privacy from authorities or random hackers monitoring you, then it is best not to re-use addresses and to use a wallet with coin control (like Electrum and some others) to reduce linking addresses as a single wallet.

You do an elliptic curve multiply with the generator point. If you're thinking you can do that by hand before Christmas then, no. 
Conceptually it's very simple but due to number size it's a very long process. I know you don't want python code but if you want to see the math steps you need to recreate by hand then check out my old simplified EC math version of a [key gen program]( It uses only built in libs (no EC modules) and breaks down the math steps as functions. Follow the steps and try by hand. Check in next year after your first pubkey is baked.
_Gx and _Gy is the generator point you will multiply your **5** with. Here is the critical line,
`(x,y) = ptAdd(mpk, ptMul((_Gx,_Gy), seq(i, c, mpk_str)))`
but instead of using seq to generate a privkey you would substitute 5. Ah, shucks, you don't need the ptAdd either. Anyway, the main thing is to look at ptMul function and see what it does for the multiply. It's the *double and add* loop that kills you. 
The resulting point (x,y) is your public key. Nowadays we use compressed keys so for that you only need the x value of the point, and then format it and convert to address. That's another super long process by hand using two hash functions.
(note - the seq function is the key gen method for old electrum v1 wallets - do not use in real life)

GreenAddress is unusual in that it's uses multi-sig for security that requires the company needs to sign your txs. You still get a seed word list but that would not be enough to access btc alone. I think they have some info on their site about if they vanish they would release your secondary keys or seed. Personally I'd rather not have some business entity hold keys to my btc, and so I never used their wallet after reading the info.
IMO multi-sig is great as long as you have control of the both or all/most of the signing keys (seeds). I used it for a couple years before getting my hw wallet to ensure no one gaining access to a single system would be able to steal btc. In my case I use a laptop (linux) system and an offline usb boot system.
I'm not familiar with iPhone apps but I did look around for my sister once and there was several well known good wallets. I think Brd (breadwallet) was one. If you have access to a laptop or desktop then I'd suggest installing and using Electrum, even if only as a second factor (multi-sig) or for doing tests like making sure you can restore from seed. Most wallets use BIP39 as their seed standard and Electrum can read that seed type but it does not natively create that kind. 
So if you have a seed on Green or Brd you can restore it on Electrum and test it first. The menu Wallet, Info will tell you if it can sign txs or is watch-only (cannot). You can make test wallets and fund with &lt; $1 or so and test the process thoroughly to make sure you know before actually sending larger amounts.

You're like an anti-freedom fighter always on guard to ensure the people are enslaved and safely in their cubicle.

1. Both.
2. To create a tx the client provides the pubkey and signature (created with private key) for each input as proof. For each output it adds a new pubkeyhash (or scripthash) (created with pubkey or redeem script). Others (including miners) will use the input proofs to validate the tx and decide whether to drop or relay it (and for miners if they can add it to a new block).

This is controlled by a setting in bitcoin software. I believe the default is still 14 days. After that it is dropped from the mempool. I don't know if miners would use the default or set it lower to clean out txs they don't intend to ever mine.
@_date: 2019-05-23 05:02:31
If you download a snapshot you should re-validate the whole chain. You can do that by removing the chainstate directory and keeping only the blocks directory. bitcoind will validate every tx since genesis and rebuild the chainstate. At the end you either have the same last block hash as the network or it's not, and the chain you have is bad.
If your node has historic utxos that other nodes don't agree with then you will likely drop txs and blocks they accept. Probably you would get stuck at the first block that spends from a "corrupt" output (utxo).

I doubt they are literally using the same funds. In fact, they shouldn't be using customer funds for operating costs at all. Even if they were it would be easy accounting to obfuscate it. So that's a moot point.
But the fact remains they are in business  as a Bitcoin exchange and many Bitcoiners would assume they are positive towards the ecosystem they are doing business in and to some extent dependent. But their track record along with OPs statements make it clear they are not pro-bitcoin but have other interests counter to their customers. 
They seek to profit by the demise of the very thing their customers seek to gain by buying and owning. They are in business seeking customer funds and use the profits against the interests of their customers.
Given that, it would be idiotic to put any trust in them, or keep bitcoin on account with them. They will obviously use those bitcoin to maximize profits by loaning them for shorting or probably dozens of other tricks they can use behind the scenes, lobbying to lower the value of the thing which brings in customers, and then promoting shitcoins as alternative. It's hard to imagine a more two-faced and untrustworthy way of doing business (though only by degree as this is how everything works now with banks).
Posts like the OP are part of educating people that they are giving money to a business that is going to work hard to thwart the interests of their customers. People need to know because there will be no remedy through the law. These guys are masters at the maze of laws that suit their predatory behavior.

Yes, that's how it works in theory. But that doesn't mean things cannot go wrong or people be deceived. I have a Trezor and trust it works as expected. There are certain types of attacks where I trust the device works as expected. 
- supply-chain - device internals are not as expected
- evil-maid - device is swapped without my knowing (use a passphrase!)
- entropy failure - device uses a super-seed or PRNG to create seeds (IMO, this is best or only candidate for exit scam)
You can take steps to check and mitigate these but for most users it's hard, and they fall back on trusting things work as expected.

While it's true it's only one amongst a few used for email encryption we should remember that it's used in many other instances. eg. pretty much all Linux package managers and updaters use gpg for signing packages to verify that you aren't installing hacked software. Many people encrypt files with gpg to store in the cloud, or transfer online. I'd guess it probably plays some part in any git based code authentication as well though I haven't gone to research that. The headline probably is a bit off target though.

You can make the debug.log group readable and then add your user to the group. That would allow you to use the grep command to easily monitor status. eg.
    
    sudo chown g+r /path/to/debug.log
    sudo adduser myuser bitcoin
    grep rescanning /path/to/debug.log
Another way is to copy the grep command to a new name and give it the setuid bit and make it owned by the bitcoin user. This allows anyone to run it but when run it has it's owner privileges so it can read the debug.log. eg.
    cp /bin/grep btcgrep
    sudo chown bitcoin: btcgrep
    sudo chmod +s btcgrep
    
    ./btcgrep rescanning /path/to/debug.log
This method has security concerns if there turns out to be a flaw in grep that allows it to do something nasty when run as btc user.

Only the chainstate and index files get re-written much. The blocks are never changed after first written. So if you're worried about that then put the chainstate on another more robust media, or keep backups. A node can rebuild the chainstate if it has the blocks directory so I don't see any real problem. I wouldn't run a critical business backend this way. I'm not sure about the LN end of it but if not many txs then I'd expect it doesn't even change much data on disk.

You can easily create a multisig 2 of 2 wallet using Electrum. You both create a wallet xprv locally and then exchange the xpub to each other to complete the wallet creation. I'm not saying I'd recommend locking up btc that way as it's unsafe (for you) as you mentioned. It's better than just simple trust. Maybe if you have them pay postage and only get that paid when complete it adds some downside to them flaking out. 
If you could agree on someone to act as arbitrator you could do a 2 of 3 multisig in the same way with that third person. But you both need to trust the third party won't sell the other out by sharing the bounty of malicious signing. 
After all these years I have not yet heard of ongoing reliable multisig escrow agent services, though possibly it exists. I think OpenBazaar has that built in so you might look at setting up your transaction through that platform. I don't know what downsides that may have. Good luck.
Incidentally this is one case where creating the wallet on a desktop is likely pretty safe as unless it's the seller who hacks your system even malware won't be able to steal the btc. I'd suggest verifying pmt address in the wallet with seller before funding the wallet.

I would probably just test on EC2 initially since I'm already familiar with that. glusterfs is just an apt-get to install so I'd go right to that. Make an AMI with glusterfs, overlayfs and bitcoind all configured and ready to go.
So then testing involves just firing up several nodes, attaching ebs disk space and manually getting them to peer to each other creating a "combined disk space". eg. 3 nodes each with 10GB when peered should each think they each have a 30 GB drive of shared space.

So let's say you go to exchange X and sell 100,000 fake BTC. The price has to drop as you sell them and there isn't enough buyers. That exchange has a price much lower than others. So how does that event get propagated universally to all exchanges, which we can see stay fairly close to each other. My point is that that only happens by arbitrage - buying those cheap coins and selling them elsewhere. And that requires genuine BTC because you cannot move fake ones.

There are approx. 54 million utxos on the blockchain. Many of those are for the same addresses but lets pretend they are all different because it increases your chances. Not all of them have a unique seed either (or a seed at all) but again lets pretend they do because that gives you a higher chance. Lets also use 12 word seeds because again they increase your chances. You need to hit a utxo on a seed out of 2^128 possible seeds (I'm using this instead of 2048^12 because the last 4 bits are checksum and it is a closer estimate, again in your favor). 
2^128 / 54x10^6 = 6.3x10^30 ( one chance in 63,000.... with 26 more zeros).
For each guess you need to derive a master key, subkey, public key, address and then check that against the utxo set (in memory hopefully). You won't do that quickly in quick thrown together code but you could maybe use code from vanitygen and GPUs to speed it up. I don't know what you'd achieve but lets guess 16 Mkeys/s on a mid-range GPU (from my experience that is way high).
6.3x10^30 / 16x10^6 = 3.9x10^23 seconds per GPU.
So now you have a choice. Use more time or buy more GPU cycles. How much do you want to spend on this attack? Let's go cheap for now and just buy 10 GPUs and see how long it would take.
3.9x10^23 / 10 gpus / (3600x24x365 secs/year) = 1.5x10^15 years.
Not bad! You would only take 1,500,000,000,000,000 years for a chance at finding one seed/key/utxo. Well, techincially that's exhaustive so for a 50% chance it could be half as long. Yay! Lets' hope it still has more than a few satoshi on it.
**edit** - Let's put this in context of familiar chance. I don't know what the ***California Super Lotto*** is but a google check says it has a 1 in 41,416,353 chance of winning. So let's say you want to be as lucky as that with your brute force.
1.5x10^15 / 41,416,353 = 30,154,160
You are about 30 million times more likely to win the Super Lotto than finding any of the utxos in the blockchain in the first year of GPUs pounding on seeds.

This would be disastrous for Bitcoin and the cost would be far higher (to miners and everyone); price would plummet as people lost faith in it's security. Miners would suddenly have to consider the new low price for revenue thereafter. 
Also, a simple double spend with high fee wouldn't do it as only one miner would get that fee and a re-org would require that more than 50% of mining continues on the re-org block. That would need to be continued until more work is done than current chain. I'm guessing there would be so much outrage that other actions would come into play to lock out the re-org.

If you really can't hang onto a physical device or paper backup then use a BIP39 word list created on a temporary usb boot stick. Remember the words. The [iancoleman]( site is good for this but only saved offline. Or create it with electrum, or use [dice]( Many ways.
Or if you  store the words in your password safe at least have a passphrase and remember that instead. 
I'd really recommend having a paper backup even if you need to store it (or hide it) at a family member's house (and by hide it I mean writing it in a spot you know and which is unlikely to be thrown away).
Stay away from single private keys as a paper wallet. They've proven problematic over the years. With a word list you can restore securely either on a usb stick or hw wallet and in the meantime you can use an xpub (created same time) as your watch-only wallet to monitor and create new addresses.

Sending the coins to the original receiver is also arbitrary theft. Consider if those txs were pmts for something and didn't go thru originally. So the receiver either got paid again and supplied good/service, or didn't and didn't supply good/service.
 
Now the miners have decided they get paid anyway. So either they got paid twice for good/service or they got paid for no good/service. If anything the dead coins should have been returned to sender and not to original receiver.
The miners are not the ones who should make this decision and the fact the fork coders didn't perceive this ahead of time is part of why BCH is a shitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-22 02:08:42
I disagree with much of that reasoning but I really don't feel like writing it all out. 
I will make one point and then leave it at that. No secure chain should depend on "principled miners" that "can mine at a loss". Well, unless the principle is their own self-interest. The reason they mine at a loss is because they created the fork to serve their need for a chain friendly to their hardware and business model.

I'd say it may depend on the balance between big miners (who have an ability to buy shorts) and small miners (who don't have resources to do this). The latter will eventually shut off as they cannot manage the losses and that will correct the difficulty and cost of mining. As that corrects and the big miners become profitable they will seek to gain by price rise rather than shorting as that resets the cycle and offers more revenue (larger potential upside moves than downside). So the sooner the bulk of unprofitable miners shutoff and wait on the sidelines the sooner the market can turnaround.

Bitcoin is not at all the same as it was 10 years ago. It's changed a lot but since you weren't there in the first years it may seem that way.
Original Bitcoin didn't even have (pubkeyhash) addresses. It didn't have p2sh (multisig and segwit). There are hundreds of improvements made over the years. 
But Bitcoin also stores a huge amount of value and the devs being conservative about throwing any random proposal into the code is a very good thing. They actually spend a lot of time looking at security implications, attack vectors (ways a change could be used to DOS/spam the network). I didn't used to think that was such a big deal but after reading thru some of the various ways those attacks have been prevented I'm amazed at how tricky it is. All the altcoins have benefited from core research and improvements, but few altcoin changes ever get merged back into Bitcoin because every change is a potential new attack vector.
I for one am very happy they are conservative. Altcoins are a good place to test ideas because the money involved is small.
As for real world use - last time I did a tx it cost less than 15 cents and confirmed in 1-2 blocks. If you are having problems now then you are doing something wrong or using a bad wallet.

The word list is 2048 long so each word is typically going to be 3 or 4 digits. You only need the first 4 letters of words anyway. I just don't see the point in saving 1 symbol in most cases if it makes you depend on a secondary document and then having to manually look up words. Not sure about ledger but with trezor you only enter 4 letters each as it auto-selects words. This sounds like adding an extra step for no good reason.

I was just reading on [their blog]( and it seems the standard method is entering words on computer but random order shown on device. So that would be like this thread is discussing, still a hard thing to crack. But on their blog they claim the difficulty is: 
(24! ÷ 256 × 8096)
which is not the answer anyone here has posted. I get the /256 probably because of checksum 8 bits in final word, but not sure why they then multiply by 8096. Anyway, it's still hard though I'd be more comfortable if the words were not known (assuming my computer were infected and malware captured them). So definitely advanced mode for me.

The difficulty only changes every 2016 blocks. The time difference since the previous difficulty chg is used to determine the adjustment. You can find the exact calculation in the source code. I don't recall off hand now but it works so that every node should get the same result. Even if blocks arrive at differing times they do have a timestamp in the header which is used and cannot change once mined.

A hardware wallet would not have been caught by this but the potential for fooling users is always out there. A fake web page that tricks users into "upgrading their hw device and requiring the seed" would probably catch some but not anyone who has requisite paranoia. After all, even the real Trezor firmware upgrade will require you to re-init from seed. It won't ask you to enter online but choose from seed lists on the device screen and many may not know this and be fooled by entering into web page.
Hardware wallets are good but nothing is perfect. With hardware there are other vulnerabilities that depend on physical access to the device. There is a post on that topic front page right now.

No worries.
If tokens is undefined then it means it's not opening the token file. That is the first argument passed to the program. So in my example above it was the file `char.txt ` which is passed on command line.  I'm not sure how I can help but maybe a screen shot of your command window may clarify what you are doing. It could be just spelling. The file name passed to the program must match the name of file you created.

I think they will succeed if people who care don't take their bitcoin out of exchange's grasp. At least that would make it harder for them - they may turn to legislative actions instead. I don't doubt they have had meetings and come up with tactics and decided to start with the ones that are most easily deniable (since money is on the line and the govt shouldn't be in the business of robbing people, right? /s). 
And here we are stuck with the meme mentality which seems to be all about getting more reddit points and amusing each other.

bc1 addresses use the bech32 format. I think this has better error detection/correction built in. More effort was put into designing this aspect of it. There is some analysis in the [BIP]( bech32 can detect up to 4 chars error with 1 in 10^9 failure rate. I can't vouch for the math behind that but it's stated to be much better than the older truncated sha256 method.
There was some other aspects designed in to make them more practical, explained in the motivation section of the BIP.

If it's from 2013 then Electrum used a different word list back then and didn't support BIP39. If you enter the words now then presumably it will detect they are version 1 and use the old word list. You should get any old txs you did back then showing up in history. If not, then it means probably the words weren't from Electrum, or it's not using the old version 1 algorithm. There wasn't many deterministic wallet options back then but I think Armory or Multbit also had some support. You may have used one of them but I think it may be harder to restore now. Do you remember if you had to do a "block sync" (wait for blockchain download) on the wallet?
I have some Electrum version 1 seed utils in my [github repo]( You might try using the mpk tool to get the master public key for restoring as watch only wallet in Electrum. I think there's a few other old utils there for listing addresses too.

Use [dice to create BIP39 seed]( words. Totally offline. Create a linux air gapped system or usb stick and install either [Electrum]( or [iancoleman]( to get the xpub (master public key) from the seed. Store that on a usb stick. Write down the first address or copy to usb stick for verification later. Wipe or break the usb stick/system. 
The seed words on paper are your wallet and give you unlimited addresses. This is better than storing single keys.
Take the xpub to your desktop or phone and restore as watch-only wallet for monitoring your wallet. Many programs will work for that. Verify first address matches. You can create new addresses, receive pmts, create txs for offline but can never spend from this wallet because no private keys are present. Read up on offline signing.
@_date: 2019-05-08 03:01:25
1. av scan is uesless here.
2. don't store seed on usb stick. Just write down seed words and export xpub for daily monitoring.
3. wipe computer and re-install os before reconnecting to web otherwise any malware already present can once again connect and send keys/seed.
4. you are much better to make a dedicated bootable usb stick for this and disconnect, boot, do stuff, power off. Don't use your normal desktop even if disconnected.

It hasn't been easy to mine your own blocks for about 8-9 years. Even when I started in 2011 you needed a GPU and would mine for a pool unless you wanted to wait years for your own block. If you thought otherwise then you have an incorrect understanding of Bitcoin mining.

You have a choice of using the Electrum 12 words seed, which is fine for security. Or using an offline copy of the [ian coleman]( site to generate a BIP39 seed and then restore that in Electrum. It can be 24 words then. One advantage to this is you can later restore the same seed into a hw wallet if you like. Another is you can use a seed passphrase.
I'm not sure you get as good entropy using javascript. That's probably debatable vs. a hw rng or even /dev/random used by Electrum. That site does allow for using dice as entropy though so that's another option.
@_date: 2019-05-18 07:30:54
Make sure you have your seed but you should not need it for upgrading Electrum unless something goes wrong. Upgrading is just re-installing anyway.

Electrum offline.
Just install Electrum to a Live boot usb, write down the seed words, and always disconnect when booting on that usb stick. Practically free, but very flexible because you can have a watch-only wallet on your regular desktop for generating receive addresses and monitoring. Read the tutorial on offline signing.

Definitely move to your own offline wallet. Small exchanges with little oversight are vanishing all the time and have highest risk. Keep as little as possible there as briefly as possible to lower your risk. 
I'd suggest a Trezor for offline easy to use storage but even waiting for one to arrive in the mail may be worrisome. (You can buy with btc [online]( but suggest only from mfr site. There are fakes being flogged in less trusted venues.)
If you have some tech skills then make a linux usb boot stick and install Electrum on it. Create a wallet and bring the xpub (menu wallet, info) to your desktop/laptop. Use that to safely manage your wallet. Read up on offline signing with Electrum.
With no tech skills I'd suggest a phone wallet but keep the phone safe from theft/access by others. They're usually safer than a desktop/laptop and easy to use. Always be sure to save the backup seed word list safely as that allows restoring the wallet again if device/system lost/stolen.

The Electrum wallet takes a 128 bit random seed and encodes it as 12 words for users to save as a backup that can regenerate the wallet (all key pairs) at any time. There is a python file in the **lib** folder called mnemonic.py which handles this encoding into words. If you copy that file and run it with either a 32 digit hex value (to encode) or 12 words (to decode) it will do that for you and spit out the result. I think it will do any length as long as a multiple of 3 words, 8 hex digits.

I didn't get this error myself but I believe it was directing users to a github page for a reasonable sounding name like "electrum-project". This is actually pretty smart as Electrum is indeed on github, it's free and doesn't require registering a domain and many who are not that up on Electrum details will fall for it. But it has been blocked now so despite all the benefits it's also pretty easy to block. On the other hand since the attacker controls his servers he can change the link in seconds and be up on a new location or even code the server to check and auto migrate.
Of course, if you know some details of Electrum it wouldn't fool you as you know the official site and github user and how to verify gpg signatures anyway. I wouldn't fall for this but many probably would and judging by attacker's address balance some did.

This just occurred to me. If you are entering this by hand from printed/written text then double check ambiguous characters.

Electrum works with Ledger, Trezor and other hw wallets. It gives you a very flexible wallet independent of the device mfr. because it uses several out of dozens of volunteer run servers. It's still light and fast but one step removed from running a full node and doing your own block verification. For the last yard in privacy and security you can run EPS (Electrum Personal Server) on your own full node to be completely self-sufficient.

When people say you'll receive they mean it figuratively not literally. There is no organization or exchange that will actually send you btc on either chain. You receive them by taking steps to ensure when you spend you are able to spend again on the other chain. Currently to do that requires some expertise. If a split persists and both chains have some value then you can expect that wallet software or services will provide a less expert way to ensure you split your btc to be valid on each chain.
Signaling is for users running a full node or miners who may add data to a block they create to signal. Users with light wallet software like electrum, copay, breadwallet etc. do not signal. The service they use (or server for electrum) would be signaling and by using that service they are supporting that. 
With a paper wallet there is no signaling unless you also happen to be running a node. Signaling doesn't matter except as an exercise in showing support for network changes.

Yes, random. That's why time between blocks is only a statistical probability not fixed duration. 
But it's not the txs that qualify, it's the other way around. They add txs to the block, generate other parts like a merkle tree from txs and order, and then randomly look for a nonce value to put in the header such that the hash of the block is valid and below a threshold determined by a difficulty value. They can and do tweak other header values and update the txs periodically as well. 
Also, nowadays it's the pool that does this and then gives out work to the actual miners as shares in the reward.

The closest thing is a hw wallet like Trezor. You can plug it into any phone or computer and use their site to send btc without worry about losing keys. I've done this on laptop and android phone.

Ah, just had a quick look at brd details and see that it syncs to the blockchain itself. So it's not really "light", though I guess it doesn't store the blockchain. Sorry I can't help with details. If it allows exporting an xpub for your wallet then it only takes a minute to install and verify using Electrum. The xpub wouldn't expose your seed/keys whereas if you restore from seed you do take some risk moving that around. According to their web site it uses BIP32 but doesn't mention BIP39 so I don't know if it will be compatible with Electrum. Otherwise you seem to be on the right track. Maybe try manually choosing the node you sync with in case it keeps syncing with a corrupt or malicious one.

It tells me that address is regularly used as part of either an exchange or mixing operation. It's not a simple single user address because it often is part of txs that have many inputs and outputs. Exchanges and mixers both do this; though the fact that address is repeatedly used over a year long basis to me hints at it being an exchange.
If you plug it into [wallet explorer]( it further tells you it's part of a larger wallet totaling 840,387 txs activity. Now that's not definitive and it doesn't hint which exchange but that level of activity also suggests an exchange address. Most exchange addresses are "owned" by a client so it may simply be the often reused address of someone with an account at the exchange, or it could be an address used for consolidation and withdrawls. Who knows? 
BTW [this]( is a more traditional account view of the address - debit/credit - balance.

I've never tried it on Windows. I think it should work but can offer little help there. 
How can Windows be cheaper for a full node? That's the opposite of what I've come across. I'll admit I never go looking for Windows VPS though. I usually test on Vultr.com and have wanted to get a sqlchain node up on Hetzner ($35/mo. dedicated server). I can't afford the ongoing cost myself but if someone had such a server I'd be willing to set it up.
It can use either rpc to sync (remote is fine if configured in bitcoin.conf to allow) or sync faster using direct file (blkdat) mode. The latter allows it to sync concurrently with the node sync by reading blk files whereas normally the rpc response is too slow (during initial bitcoin sync).
It requires a fast SSD drive and decent cpu/ram performance to sync the sql layer. The last time I did it (a year ago) it took about 5 days to fully sync.

bitcoind already has a ZMQ facility. You just need to enable it in the config with what port to listen on:
        zmqpubrawtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:8432
        zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:8432
And then add some code to your software to receive msgs. Python has a module `pyzmq` that works well. Using that here is a sample of how you would handle raw tx and block msgs (you need some raw tx decode code). This is from my open source sqlchain project which monitors bitcoind and updates a sql db:
    def getBlocksZMQ(cur, blk, chainwork):
        try:
            import zmq
        except ImportError:
            log("Warning: Could not find pyzmq; ZMQ disabled")
            sqc.zmq = False # prevent repeated inits
            return blk
        zctx = zmq.Context()
        zsck = zctx.socket(zmq.SUB)
        zsck.setsockopt(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, "rawblock")
        zsck.setsockopt(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, "rawtx")
        zsck.setsockopt(zmq.RCVTIMEO, 1000)
        zsck.setsockopt(zmq.LINGER, 0)
        zsck.connect(sqc.cfg['zmq'])
        log("Upgrade to ZMQ on %s." % sqc.cfg['zmq'])
        cur.execute("select ifnull(max(sync_id),0) from mempool;")
        sync_id = cur.fetchone()[0]
        while not sqc.done.isSet():
            try:
                msg = zsck.recv_multipart()

Older versions of Electrum mobile didn't store the seed as securely. I think they put it in a encrypted file instead of some kind of secure store. Don't quote me exactly on that but I do recall in release notes at some point they changed that aspect.
I'm guessing some hacker out there runs a address watcher daemon that monitors probably thousands/millions of addresses and when it see a tx then grabs it. He probably has malware on multiple devices or platforms which finds and sends seeds or keys home to be merged into that database waiting for some eventual hits.
Internet connected wallets are always at some higher level of risk compared to  offline or hw wallets. You've had a relatively cheap lesson on how stealthy these things are, so learn from it when you deal with larger sums.
btw a 3.. address may be multisig or segwit. It only means it's a P2SH (pay to script hash) address of which there are several variants.

For Bitcoin to become stable it's price will need to be well over $1 million. This is because at that level the movements of millions of $$ thru btc will have little impact much like moving millions has near zero impact on forex markets. Think of the difference a 3 foot wave has in your swimming pool compared to the ocean. For stability Bitcoin needs to be an ocean that trade happens on where waves are superficial. IMO That's not going to happen for a long time. If you want to be the guy who bought btc at $4000 and lives off it at $1 million then don't fret about price in the meantime. Use money you don't need and sock it away like it's IBM in 1960 and check back in 10 years. In the meantime it will be one rocky ride and you'll easily get thrown off.

They go to bitcoin heaven unless you provide the info needed to the people you want to get access.
For example, you could securely store an envelope with seed(s) and give the location to your executor. That requires trust obviously. Otherwise you need to get a bit creative how to pass on the info without trusting anyone, or setup timelocked txs that pay to inheritance wallets if you don't intervene. That's possible but not very easy afaik.

There is only 1 or 2 programmers, only a few miners and a lack of careful oversight. Without more people watching and checking code you really have two choices: use what they write, or sell and move to another coin. Ok, a third option is to fork again, like they did already - but how manys times are you going to do that and how few users can you really see as viable.


I believe the subsidy diminishes the same on both coins (unless I'm mistaken and they altered that in BSV). But on Bitcoin miners will receive fees to pay for security and on the others the whole intent is fees will be very low because space is practically unlimited. If no one is paying fees then miners will move to securing a chain that does have fees.

To add to above, everyone knew that it was hard or impossible to withdraw fiat from MtGox months (almost a year?) before it failed. It was clear the price was higher because clients bought btc to get out of there. With bitfinex it's currently more likely that arbitrage is weak due to fear of holding fiat/tether on the exchange. That would be my theory without having any insider info.

It will cost you far more in electricity than btc is worth so the smart move would be to just buy btc. In fact that's pretty much always been the smart move barring some time in the early days.

Non-listening nodes contribute to decentralization. They are just as important for economic use of Bitcoin. People with wallets using Bitcoin can function behind a non-listening node just as well as a listening node. The only thing they don't do is listen for first contact usually from new nodes needing to sync the blockchain. They often don't have the available bandwidth to supply blocks for full syncs, or at least that's why many don't open their port. It's a poor job to act as if non-listening nodes aren't contributing. They are connected to fewer other nodes (typically 8 only) but they do relay txs and blocks just the same. It is even worth more to know how many full nodes are out there compared to listening nodes. Even btc devs like Luke have built tools for this and state this.

If you have a Trezor then you can open the wallet.trezor.io site in your browser and use that wallet safely. I think you'd have to copy/paste the address instead of QR scan. This is better than using some web wallet because the keys are safe inside the hw device and never leave. You do need to ensure the address is not changed while on clipboard - there is malware that can do that out there.

Confirmations are probabilistic. They can take anywhere from 0 seconds to 120 minutes (approx. longest ever seen, assuming correct fee), with no guarantee even then. 
If you are accepting large payments or items which are downloadable and hard to claw back then it's best to wait at least 2 confirmations (because orphan blocks happen quite often). If you are taking payment for small amounts or items you won't ship for hours at minimum, then you can accept with 0 confirmations (at small risk) by setting up your node to be diversely connected. 
By that I mean it's connected to many nodes across a wide region so you are not cut off from a majority of the network. I have no idea how to determine that. The intent is to make sure the tx you see is widely relayed before any malicious tx can be injected. In this sense your own node can help with ensuring you relay the tx you accept to all others. 
Most vendors won't take 0-conf txs and it's only worth doing when the value is low, acceptance time is important (eg. pos checkout with lineups), and you reduce risk of possible double spends by direct relaying widely.

They're not speaking very technically correct about the keys. It's obviously pointless to hold keys and not the btc. What they mean to say is that you should hold your own btc in your own wallet (keys) and take them out of the hands of institutions who may be using them for other means while saying you own them. It's becoming more and more clear that this isn't just about your own btc but about the health of the system overall. Bitcoin is stronger when you take your btc and hold them yourself with your own keys. We've been saying it for years but most non-technical users still let "banks" hold them and accept an IOU (account entry).

You can restore the seed with electrum wallet. You can use electrum with the hw wallet too for a better (more private) interface that has more features. Or you can use the mfr web wallet tool for quick access anywhere. You don't have to buy another hw wallet to recover unless you want to.
If the hw wallet price irks you and you have moderate tech savvy then make a usb boot stick with linux on it. Install electrum and use that as an offline wallet. It's main downside is less convenience for spending but if you just want to hold long term then that matters little.

It's in my node's mempool. I'm guessing that some nodes like blockstream may be behind or maybe discard low fee txs. Not sure why it wouldn't show up. Try again or some more explorers. 
Fees are up a bit right now so this tx probably won't confirm for at least a few hours assuming the backlog gets cleared soon. Right now, 8000 txs ahead of you. 1 sat/byte is very low.
edit - it's showing on blockstream now, and should show up on your node. You can spend it to yourself with a higher fee to incentivize miners to confirm it more quickly. Actually, not sure if core lets you spend unconfirmed outputs but I think maybe - I use electrum and it does.

I've never sold any fiat to have btc. I have mined and been paid in btc and bought items with btc. It has been a currency for me though admittedly it's a small one in the world at large. Stability as a currency will only happen when it's price reaches a point where millions can be traded and have no visible impact on price. It may never get there or it may - who can see the future. It will not be stable when moving a few million $ worth causes market moves and arbitrage opportunities across exchanges. The daily forex volume of any of the stable currencies far, far outshines trade in btc, and I doubt btc can be stable until it's in the same league.

If that's not a mistake then it would be very worrying as it could point to a flawed RNG process allowing someone to generate your seed and sweep it. Where did you store the seed and is it possible someone else got access to it, or if stored encrypted, was the password strong?

There is no account to sign up for Bitcoin. You can sign up for specific web site services like Coinbase or Circle, but for Bitcoin you download and install wallet software and it will generate "addresses" which you can use to receive funds. 
Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning it has no central owner/operator. It is a free network of users running software. The software manages and broadcasts transactions to the network without any central controller.
Anyone can generate their own addresses, which are the closest thing to a Bitcoin account, on their own, in the privacy of their home without anyone else knowing or censoring. It is simply a mathematical operation based on huge random numbers and cryptography.

Not sure about Blue wallet or what it is. But a hardware wallet is not the only secure way. 
If cost is an important factor then create a usb boot linux and install Electrum. I just posted this on [another thread]( It works, is nearly free, and gets close to hw security with less convenience. If you just want to hodl and sometimes send more btc in to the wallet it is very good. I used it for years before buying a trezor and it's a well proven low-cost method.

Maybe a derivation path issue?  Just guessing. 
Were you able to retrieve/spend it from the Coinomi wallet? 
Presumably the address list was different on Coinomi than on Nano? That kind of points to a differing derivation path. Was the seed originally created on Coinomi and then restored to Nano later?

Your question seems to mix up a seed and a private key. Both are basically random numbers. But created and used in somewhat different ways.
Most wallets now are HD (hierarchical deterministic) - meaning they have keys generated using a deterministic algorithm in a structured hierarchy of purposes/types.
In this type of wallet the seed starts out as a random number. How it is generated is very important and it should be as truly random as possible. Any pattern or pseudo randomness can be used to predict or know the seed. The seed is then used as input to hashing and hardening algorithms to create a master private key. The seed is also encoded as a series of words for convenient saving on paper by humans.
The master private key is used as base of a chain of keys also generated via hashing (and sometimes hardening) algorithms to generate each key in a sequence. The derivation path is a piece of text also used as input to the hashing and provides a layout for what purpose (regular,change,accounts) or types of address (p2pkh, p2sh-p2wpkh, p2wpkh, p2wsh etc).
This is all a fancy and structured way of creating what are essentially random but predictable private keys. In non-HD wallets (common in the past) the private keys were more simply just random numbers directly, but that meant you had to store all the random keys instead of only a seed phrase.
To answer the safety issue - since they are generated randomly it is critical to know the entropy source and random number generator (RNG) is properly designed and tested to be truly random. There have been bugs in the past that have led to poor randomness and vulnerable keys, eg. javascript on some platforms. 
A hardware entropy source is generally considered best but even that needs statistical  testing and proving. There is software for doing that analysis and also for using various noise sources as entropy eg. thermal diode noise, video sensor noise, etc. Some hw wallets use the random initialization of static ram as entropy source.

If the trading engine at least were coded in C then they might actually solve their lag problems. That and seriously optimizing SQL queries. Who knows how much time they spend on that as most admins just throw more money at it by installing faster/more servers.
And I don't think there is a decent PHP Bitcoin/ECC library yet (that I've heard of). I just wrote a PHP extension that uses openssl to generate addresses and it is about 1000x faster than the available PHP functions. Even Python ECC functions were about 30x faster (roughly).

To run a pruning node you install bitcoind (from bitcoin.org web site or a linux distributions repositories) and configure it for pruning by setting the prune=X value to the number of MB you want it to use (min. 550), either as command line option or more likely in the bitcoin.conf file. It will download the whole blockchain but only keep the last portion of size you set. It does keep the chainstate data (UTXOs) as well. Once it is sync'd you can monitor the zmq data to track any changes to addresses you wish. (You need to config a line for zmq in the conf file as well or it does not provide the data). 
Electrum is a wallet which you can install from electrum.org. It is a light node so it does not download the blockchain and uses very little space. It can be installed in a few minutes usually. Once installed you can create a "import wallet" and copy/paste any addresses you wish to watch in the wallet.You can add more later also IIRC. It will query an electrum server with the addresses and build a history ledger of all txs on each address, but they will show all in one list and therefor also be combined in total balance. If you want to watch each address as a separate ledger you would need to create an import wallet for each. This could be automated with a script if many addresses need to be kept separate but it does get unwieldy for many perhaps.
Electrum is easier and faster and requires not coding but has it's limits and the better choice probably depends on your exact needs.

This makes no sense. What is even meant by trading volume? On exchanges worldwide? Or is that txs in blocks?

[Lopp]( did a review of physical metal wallets. That one warped and letters fell out when heated up. He may have heated it more than expected in a real fire but still not ideal in my book. 
I'm going with punched dots on titanium (no loose letters to fall out). Based on his testing punched/hammered letters/dots withstand more abuse. I got a [piece of titanium]( off ebay for $3 and used a [center punch]( I had (was $3 on ebay years ago)(amazingly it works well, no hammer needed). Ti has a higher melting point than most metals. Not highest but best for low price. [Here]( is my cc size seed template. I can make two seeds from that piece above. I'd show a finished one but can't obviously. [Here's]( a test on aluminum.
Anyway, I agree that in a safe in a real fire most likely the electronics will melt/deform at minimum. I'm surprised they can be called fireproof because paper burns at a pretty low temp (say ~250-300C) and that's likely what they mean to keep safe. I think I read somewhere house fires reach ~800C. Ti melts at ~1600C. btw Gr2 is softer, Gr5 is hardened alloyed with Al,V.

It's actually pretty simple. Usually when someone wants to short sell bitcoin they take on a substantial risk. But with a futures market they can buy futures as protection and short sell physical bitcoin. If they have deep pockets and access to a large pool of bitcoin to borrow they can sell, and sell, and sell. Each time they buy the same amount of bitcoin futures as protection against the shorting blowing up in their face. If it does and they get squeezed the increase in futures price offsets their loss in the shorts. They need lots of fiat to cover like this, perhaps on different trading platforms but the net effect is low risk suppression of price.
The way to fight this is to take your bitcoin off exchanges and put it in your own wallet where it cannot be loaned out and sold against you. That's one reason many will tell you to keep the keys to your bitcoin, along with the risk of them being hacked of course, or frozen, as we often hear about. Don't let them sell your own bitcoin against you.

I'm pretty sure Word and 7-Zip have JTR/hashcat modules for brute forcing so your password is ultimately going to be the determinant of security. Using a mental algorithm is generally pretty weak.

Lack of liquidity. 
The Bitcoin markets are not deep enough to absorb large buys/sells with little effect. For example, the Forex markets are huge in comparison so when someone buys/sells even hundreds of millions of USD the effect is small. 
With bitcoin on any given exchange there are at most a few hundred btc of bids/ask on the order book within a small margin of the price. Placing a market order for larger than that wipes out all the orders causing a large swing. It usually bounces back quickly as arbitrage transmits the difference to other exchanges, dampening the effect.

It's been years since I built from source but I do think you should not use sudo to build. You may use it to install after built as it needs to access system bin dirs, but otherwise not. Not sure that matters for you but it may cause differing root environment and miss any settings made in your normal bash environment. You should not need root access for compiling/linking, and using it can alter how it builds.
Also, make sure you are doing ./configure first. That sets up the environment and config for the make to occur. Before retrying this be sure to do a "make clean" to wipe out past sessions and start from a clean slate.

One thing I should mention. rocksdb engine has to be installed separately to mysql and it works better for large random data like this but it also is memory hungry. I found on a 4GB RAM system it does a lot of swapping. I think 8GB may be the lowest RAM it's good on.

Ideally you'd have 16-32GB and 240GB SSD for a decent system though it can get by on much less (slower).

In Electrum you can enable RBF and then click that option when sending. If it doesn't go through in a reasonable time then you can bump up the fee to help it.
txs don't fail for quite some time. It could hang around for a week or more and prevent re-using those outputs until it finally gets dropped. So better to use RBF since that is available and costs nothing extra.

Collectible may be the wrong word due to it's common use for physical items. What do you call something people save up and store which has no use or value? The early miners and bitcoiners certainly were mining and storing virtual bits that had no real use or value. The first two years were like that and 99.9% of the world didn't even know they existed.

I like to use [this site]( but there are quite a few. This one takes a bit of graph reading to understand but it gives you an overview of what's going on now and in recent past.
Each line is a fee value and notches are the blocks consuming txs. When a notch cuts into a particular fee line it means txs at that fee are getting confirmed. So you look at what is the lowest fee value that is getting "notched" to figure what chance a given fee has of being confirmed soon. 
So, looking right now, blocks are quite slow (wider notches) and fees in the 80-100 sat range are getting confirmed. But a few days ago fees in the 2-5 sat range were easily confirmed. Seems a lot of people are buying/moving btc today (guess: because price has been going up and maybe are moving off exchanges to wallets). Click on a longer timeframe (24h, 2d) to see how it's changed recently.

Well, it may not be, but I wouldn't if I were doing this. MtGox has a record of paying to that address and if later the SR site was "infiltrated" they could possibly link that payment back to MtGox and ID who transferred them. The obvious step would be to go via a mixer service like at blockchain.info. Full paranoia mode would be to go via a mixer using Tor to make sure IP addresses aren't recorded. But even without a mixer, going to a wallet first adds at least a step between.

Greed generally has a context of excess or causing harm to others in order to get something. Saying that *greed* = *need* is removing any meaning from the word greed. This is a trick used by those who want to make greed sound like it's a good thing. It changes the meaning of greed to simply mean the same as need. Taking care of your self and ensuring your family has food on the table is not the same as taking it to excess without thought for the cost to others.
I don't think of speculation as *greed* anyway. It is simply another way to try and earn money. Anyone who has ever speculated and done trading knows that there is an energy input to this activity. Speculators often spend a great deal of energy trying to decide when to buy/sell and watching prices, figuring out systems etc. I don't speculate but I'm glad others do as without it you could not go to an exchange at any moment and sell your coins easily. Trillions of $$ trade every day on forex markets ensuring the prices are fairly stable. Without that volume you would have volatility like Bitcoin and Bitcoin won't become stable until trading volume is hundreds of times higher than now.

Wallets are a "container" managed by your software. On the blockchain there is only outputs on addresses. If you have a tx that takes several inputs (that is, uses up some utxos) and creates one output (to a single address) then that consolidates all those btc into one utxo in the chaninstate. The utxo set is reduced. If you then spend that onwards to another single address then you destroy one utxo and create another utxo (even if it's to the same address). The utxo set changes but is approx. the same size.
It's your wallet software which queries the blockchain for any utxos on addresses you own and sums them to make a wallet balance.
So in answer to your question if you had the private keys for all addresses with utxos and could sign a massive tx sending them all to one address then there would be only one utxo in the chainstate. Now, you can't in reality do that because some keys are permanently lost or never existed (unspendable addresses have been sent to), and since there is an max input count per tx/block you would need to do it in several rounds to reduce utxo count and then reduce again.
You may find [this utxo info page]( interesting. There is approx 54 million utxos.

Just an update in case anyone is actually reading this. I did a bit more checking and the reason the debug bench figures seem to make little sense is because of the **assumevalid** default of block  - which means blocks before that one don't do signature validation to save time.

I believe the verify time includes the connect time so the difference of 0.194ms is the extra time signature verification took. ie. a substantial portion. But of course, since the verification is turned off until such a recent block the net result is that little would be gained by an FPGA accelerator module. Blah.

The simplest way is to install [Electrum]( and then create an "import" wallet containing the address in question. It will retrieve the address history and show you a ledger of all in/out of that address. Each line reads like a normal bank acct. debit/credit, balance. That will take at most 5 minutes to install and use.
(you may find it wants to create a normal wallet when first run, just do that and then don't use it. After that, Select File, New/Restore, enter whatever filename, then choose "Import Bitcoin addresses or keys" and paste address)

I don't think congestion will be resolved in the near term. If you're holding long term then no big deal but for day to day use fees aren't likely to be lower soon.
To be clear, if you enter both BIP38 key and password in breadwallet then you are trusting that they don't abuse that info. To put back on the tin foil hat you'd have to use breadwallet in a way it cannot contact home base. eg. on a phone in airplane mode and then factory reseting/wiping the phone after. Even then you're trusting things behave as expected. Better build a faraday cage too... :) 
As for testing a BIP38 key there are some utilities around that you can copy offline to check the keys/addresses. I have a few python scripts in my [github]( but also there are others I've seen around and if you use them in strict offline / wipe protocol then it's safe. You can extract the private key from a BIP38 key and generate the address from that - if it matches the address you created along with the BIP38 key then it's a confirmation the values are good.

The safest possible model for Electrum is a dual system approach. Offline (not net connected) and online (net connected). The online system is watch only (no seed), and allows receiving funds. But when you want to spend you create a transaction and save it to usb stick, carry that to the offline system, read it with that Electrum and "sign" it. Then save and carry back to the online system for actually sending. This is most safe because at no time does the seed ever exist on the net connected system, and therefore is not vulnerable to key loggers, hackers etc. And of course, all this is backed up by writing down your seed words and storing safely, perhaps in a safe or similar places.
This approach is suitable for high values but a bit cumbersome for small amounts. You might have a second full wallet on the net connected system for petty cash amounts and refill it now and then from the offline savings wallet.

But seriously. It's the same as anything else - supply and demand. What makes carrots worth what they're worth? People want to eat them and are willing to pay. More people wanting to eat less carrots available make them willing to pay more, given a lack of something better they like to eat.
The reason for bitcoin costing more is primarily more people coming into the market wanting to own them and fewer people wanting to sell them. A ton of possible reasons factor in to why people want them. Learn about Bitcoin and why they're useful.

Yes, but AFAIK no wallet offers this. I am writing a plugin for Electrum called Time Machine that provides this (CLTV) feature. I have it working to create and track lock addresses but still have to write the code to sign the spend tx from the address. It also will provide an nLocktime feature so you can post date txs. Hope to have it ready for testing for new year.
Coinb.in does offer this now but it's kind of manual and requires using keys rather than  being based off a seed like my plugin. My plugin is compatible with Coinb.in so a spend tx could be signed there but it would require exposing a key and that's not very workable.

 - it's the best general purpose wallet due to features and ease of use. But as with any wallet on a desktop/laptop do not store too much btc there unless also using offline signing (which electrum supports very well). Always beware any non-official electrum web site as there is many malware and phishing activities trying to dupe people. It's by far the largest target in this category.

You should decide what type of wallet based on the money involved and how much it would hurt to lose it. For small amounts probably a phone wallet with backup seed words is fine. For next level you might use an offline boot usb stick with Electrum, or some combo of that with a desktop. For larger amounts, or if you want security without messing about, or have low tech IQ, it's seriously a good idea to look at hardware wallets because they **simplify the process** of getting great security. 
The main point is not a specific wallet type or brand but that the wallet you use gives you **control of the private keys** (or seed) and you take the steps to write down and secure that info.

I'm sure "many clever ways" is their hush words for "using Bitcoin if it fits the need". I'd think the problem isn't they won't use but it just doesn't fit their needs. If there was rich people in VZ that wanted bitcoin and were standing ready to provide the needed services/goods then they'd probably use it to get control but I'm guessing that is not the case. If some General would be willing to take secret bitcoin to do something-something-or-other. In that situation, where not public, I think they'd likely use it because it can be deniable. The CIA is probably wishng they had more access to "clean" bitcoins.

You'll get approx. half as much savings as you would with a native segwit address when you later go to spend. 
You don't mention what wallet you plan to send to. You can make a transition address in one wallet and then forward on to your final bc1 type address. This probably only makes sense if you choose to forward when the fees are low as it should cost very little and you probably don't need to pay for a fast confirmation. Once in a bc1 address you'll gain full advantage of fee savings later especially if you end up having to send when fees are high.
Electrum supports making as many wallets as you like of various types; legacy, segwit-legacy, segwit native, multisig, hw wallets etc.

For BIP39, SHA512 is used in master key generation. There can be other ways and/or standards but that is the most common now. It also uses PBKDF2 for hardening. While many ways could be used, standards are important if you always want the same keys from the same seed across different wallets.

A time estimate can never take into account changes in demand after it is made. If more txs are sent later with higher fees then they will take priority causing delays for those with lower fees.
edit - Just checked and seems 60-80 sat/vB are needed for quick confirm now. If you really want this to confirm and don't mind paying a higher fee, and if one of the outputs is change to your wallet, then you can create a new tx spending the unconfirmed change to yourself with a fee high enough to cover both txs size. This is called CPFP (child pays for parent) - when miners see a child tx with enough fees to cover it's parent they prioritize both based on the total fees for both. If not critical then just wait and it will get confirmed when the demand drops off.

Think of the price reflecting the adoption of the currency. Project into the future how many people worldwide would want the characteristics it offers when it has reached saturation. Compare how many people hold some bitcoin now. The ratio is the driving force forward. 
If you don't think it has useful properties and that no one will want to use it in the future then you shouldn't buy in. But most of us here believe it is useful and that eventually more and more people will want to use it. Most of the planet hasn't even heard of it and can't use it yet. Will that change or won't it? Decide and place your stake. Or hedge and take a small position. I think a lot of us have done that as well. Own some small amount you can afford to lose.

Not just the miners. While miners could mine a new block with new rules it also depends on the rest of the network to accept and relay these blocks. So while miners can control block creation they cannot determine what is accepted by the network. This is why running a node is also important even when not being a miner. It's your vote in the network.

Yes, as long as your passphrase is not short. 
I was thinking of this a bit and came up with an idea of using the same Arty 7 FPGA  they use in the talk (b/c I own one) to store a ram version of utxo addresses and an engine for generating the first address of a seed. It would take some doing but I think you could achieve perhaps 100-200 million passphrases / sec. Note that you do not need to store the full address in RAM but only a bit indicator that the address exists. So you can siphash (fast) a pubkey into a shorter RAM address to DRAM on board and if the bit is set then it is a known used address.
At that rate and with 24/7 brute forcing on ascii text chars (eg.64 chars) 8 chars would take up to 16 days, 9 chars up to 1042 days. That doesn't optimize or use dictionaries. Just a ballpark figure without any in depth analysis. 
Probably a GPU could be put to use and be even faster. Not sure as I've never coded for them. But I have created FPGA cores.
**revision**: It had slipped my mind that passphrase to seed was using PBKDF2. So given that and a bit of digging around on FPGA cores doing PBKDF2 I'd guess it's more like 10,000-40,000 per second, not millions.

An HD (hierarchical deterministic) wallet is one where all the keys/addresses are created from a seed value. Which has no bearing on fees or how txs work.
He is talking about how fees are valued by miners. They select txs for confirmation based on fee paid per byte because they have a 1MB block to fill and their highest profit comes from maximizing fee per byte.
So when you send a tx you will end up paying per byte sent. Every time you send btc to your wallet in a new tx you create an "output" on your address(es). This output will later be what you use up as an "input" to a new spend tx. More inputs means more bytes means higher fees.
The only ways around this are to make less frequent but larger txs because the btc amount has no bearing on tx byte size, or else to wait until the network resolves scaling issues and there is reduced congestion and lower fees.
@_date: 2018-12-04 09:05:05
Now that I think about it it's probably a matter of calculating target value and dividing into that. I don't have it handy but I think target is directly related to difficulty. Target is the hex value the winning hash needs to be lower than. So (**blockhash/target**) will be 1.0 when it is exactly low enough and the further from it (only lower) the smaller the fraction it will be. Lower values would be acceptable if the difficulty were higher so they exceed the requirement.

Are you sure that it's changed? As I said I haven't reviewed code lately and I'm still using 1.73 at this time.
edit: I just did a very quick code review on github. Not thorough but as far as I can see it hasn't changed. It uses the seed words as indexes to the word list and with some simple manipulations it builds the original random seed back from the words. Not a brain wallet method.

If you plan to keep accumulating then, yes, get your btc into your own wallet. It's not a huge amount so you might start with a good phone wallet and then later buy a Trezor/Ledger hw wallet. Or order one now if the price isn't a worry.
If you have some modest tech skill then you can save money by creating your own [linux usb boot stick]( installing Electrum and making your own offline wallet. Either way keep the seed words stored safely on paper/metal - that's how you recover from any loss/failure.

If when you say password you mean password then no, they cannot spend from your wallet. They may get access for viewing history (privacy loss). But if you mean "seed words" then yes, they can. You should never have your seed words on any computer. The whole point of a hw wallet is the seed is never accessible online.
You mean 24 words I hope. That is all you need to restore your wallet later into another Nano, other hw wallet, or software like Electurm.
For better security make sure your seed words are stored safely, redundantly if possible (multiple locations), and ideally stamped in metal or some fire proof backup (though having them in a secondary location like a safe deposit box also protects against fire). The important thing to know is that the seed words are everything. Anyone getting them can take all your btc. That's why they should never be stored or written down anywhere accessible by others.
The purpose of a hw wallet like a Nano is to keep the keys safe in the device and only be able to sign transactions when the device is present and when confirmed on the screen. But if the seed words are found by others then they can restore them on their system and take you btc.

Yes. Both chains have size-based fees but Bitcoin developers believed to was better to increase tx size efficiency before increasing block size. With a large block size the fees aren't market based (as much). I was around and mining in 2011-2013 and I remember the days of near empty blocks and zero fees. It was ok then because the subsidy was so much higher (50 btc). It was always expected that a fee market would develop to offset dwindling subsidy. 
Bitcoin developers decided it makes a lot more technical sense to maintain chain security and use second layers to improve privacy and tx volume scaling. It's more complex but also far more effective than the simplistic idea of just making bigger blocks. There is a long and convoluted history to this debate.

Ok. I went and looked at the code. SaveMemPool uses the same format as DumpMemPool used on program shutdown. The code is in validation.cpp line 4863. I don't see any docs but's it's fairly easy to figure from the code.
    uint64_t  version value
    uint64_t  mempool size value (probably tx count as returned by mapTx size call)
    
    array of mempool records as follows:
       tx - serialized data of transaction, see below
       int64_t  time
       int64_t feeDelta (not sure what fee delta is)
    
    mapDeltas (not sure what that is)
The tx serialize function is at transaction.h line 250. It basically just dumps raw tx data in sequence: version, vins, vouts, witness stuff, locktime. You'd have to look at data sizes for more detail there.
Hope that helps but I suspect you would need to read more of the code to actually write your own. Especially if you need the "deltas" data to make sense.
When bitcoind starts up it must load the mempool so you could likely grab code from there (validation.cpp line 4758). You'd have to translate it to equivalent code if not using cpp.

They're actually really easy to use. I set my sister up in 10 minutes. You have a paper seed word list as backup in case it ever gets stolen/broken/lost. The reason you have one is to sign transactions. 
If you just want to hodl long term and never spend then you can get away with just the paper seed words but you still have to create the word list securely. That's something the hw wallet is good for but there are other ways that don't cost money. 
Think of a hw wallet as a paper wallet that is secure and easy to use everyday. A paper wallet on it's own is a hassle to use securely.

What every node actually does is "execute the script". The script tells them how to validate. If the script fails then the tx is invalid and dropped. If the script results affirmative then the tx is good and relayed or mined. So to understand the steps to validate you would look at the script in each tx and break it down as if executing it on a stack until complete. IIRC the network doesn't accept just any script but has a few so called standard ones which are valid. I'm not sure if that has changed. It was years ago that I studied this and I haven't exactly followed updates closely. In any case the script language (Op Codes) is very limited.
In order to understand it you will need to be clear in language. Terms like "hash of the current sender" make no sense. I'd suggest looking at the op codes (language) and how they are run to see how a validation occurs.

A watch only wallet would be safe in this case but if you upgraded your offline software with the bad client then it potentially could be at risk. I doubt this instance took advantage of it but potentially an offline client could replace an address and change the tx that you sign. 
That's why even with offline wallets it's critical you check the details of the signed tx before broadcasting. Now what will do your head in is that bad software like this could be so co-ordinated that it will display a fake details screen for a bad tx signed on offline. If used offline it could store details in the tx file that an online watch-only wallet could use to trick you. The only real solution to this is a hw wallet because it will show a bad address on screen and not ever give out the keys. You still need to be vigilante and check the address/amounts on screen.

Electrum seeds are not BIP39. They contain seed type info encoded as a prefix. But in the case of old wallets Electrum actually uses a different word list as well. So when checking a seed it first checks if it's an old one based on words, and then if not it tries as a new one and decodes the type info.
You can't convert the seed so you would have to create a new one native segwit (default) and send the balance to it. Legacy addresses are based on hashing a public key has whereas new segwit addresses are based on hashing a script. So converting a single address is not possible either.

But if you are looking at a fair bit of money then you are putting them at serious risk with the IRS as they won't be declaring it on taxes. So that's a pretty serious downside. I guess it depends how much you despise your parents and want to hurt them. They'll probably be held liable for your stupidity. Oh, and you'll have to constantly monitor for snail mail for them to hide any of that. Bad idea.

There is no money in running a node. You do it because you want to ensure your wallet is independently verified and doesn't trust any other entity for tx info.
Mining does not require a node and is a completely different thing which you can no longer do (profitably) on normal CPU/GPU hardware.
You can copy the blockchain (the bitcoin data directory) from system to system and it will work ok. Some use this to download on a fast system and then keep sync on a raspi.
Otherwise, too many questions and limited time.

They would have to trick you into using the wrong site. So it depends on how you access the site - ideally you remember and type it manually. Malware may alter bookmarks, or wait for a site lookup and return incorrect IP values to intercept you, or it could alter wallet software like Electrum. You could be on an infected network (like at a cafe) where arp cache poisoning causes your computer to use a gateway that has MITM code intercepting DNS lookups. I'm only mentioning simple attacks as the really advanced stuff I likely don't even know. These ones are all easily doable without much resources.

No idea. I've done that and it worked properly but that was a while ago. Maybe there is some bug now. I'd try again with a new seed. 
Or they've changed something recently about how the seeds work. I was looking at the code earlier today and I noticed unlike before that they repeatedly generate seeds until a specific condition is met. So it seems like they may no longer allow any random value - though I'm not sure. It may have something to do with changing to be BIP32 compliant soon.

Decoding bitpay invoices and running a btcpay server are not in any way comparable. One would be used by a customer to bypass the BIP70 protocol, and the other by a vendor needing a way to not use bitpay in the first place.
However, there have already been a couple bitpay decoders kicking around. One thing to know about these is it is possible to "decode" the pmt protocol and provide a malicious address to steal a pmt. So beware when using them that you take a risk by trusting the decoder.

Now, for me, with ASIC miners the electricity cost in my area is still about 20% of the btc price. This will get worse until, maybe next month or so the electricty cost exceeds the btc price. The real cost for miners now is the up front investment cost of buying the equipment, so to know if you would make anything worth while you figure out how much you will spend and calculate how many years it will take it to be repaid before you make any profit at all.
Probably right now it's not worth it for you at all because even with free electricity your net connection cost would mean you have to make a pretty substantial investment in mining equipment to have a hope of just paying for that. eg. about 15-20 ASICs just to pay for net, and you're still not making any return on your investment.
Use one of the online mining calcs to project some figures.

Yes, it will run fine on a raspi3. I'd suggest copying your current blockchain onto a usb drive and mounting that on the pi. One thing about using a pi is it takes a long, long time to sync so you are much better off if you already have a complete blockchain and can just move the drive over. 
I don't know what's going on with your current system but even on a pi3 it should be nowhere near using much CPU%. Mine generally only uses 1-3% on a measly Celeron except for when a new block comes in and it bursts high briefly. I recall the pi3 not using much either. You can do other things like I used to run my kodi media center and torrent client with a node all on the pi. Only issue is long initial sync.
Also, for a wallet you can get away with a pruning node and use only a few GB disk space.

I wouldn't say that tax laws don't exist for Bitcoin yet. Any business that makes a profit has a tax liability. I guess you mean you're waiting for a story to break where the IRS actually audits a business and charges them with tax evasion. The laws are pretty complete and don't exclude Bitcoin any more than they exclude making money from pork bellies or corn.
The only advantage with Bitcoin is that you can hide them. But any serious business is going to question how well they can do that if they end up getting audited and have to show where money went. It's not really any different from hiding cash under a mattress. If the tax man calls then for sure he'll treat money tied up in Bitcoin the same as money tucked under the mattress. They'll simply attribute a market value to it and move forward.

LOL. Selling off mining rigs doesn't drop the hash rate. What do you suppose new owners do with them - make paperweights, arrange them in arrays and watch the LEDs flash?
Anyway, in case you're new around here this has all happened before in Winter 2011. Many miners turned off, many didn't. The hash rate dropped until the price rose enough for them to turn back on. Some like me kept mining in expectation the price would eventually rise. I was mining for $2/btc in electricity and many were using free electric in their dorm rooms.

An encrypted file is at best as good as the password securing it. So that means using a long one requiring a paper backup and you're back to the same as having the seed written down. I'd suggest it's better to have the seed written down more times in safe places offline than an encrypted file on any internet connected location. Possibly a file on usb stick along with paper is ok but really make sure it hasn't been on a connected system. As an example if it's been on a hard disk then malware next year could do a raw scan and find header info related to encrypted data and decide to send it home for brute forcing. Devious minds at work - so best when there is an air gap on any critical data.

This isn't even a deterrent for stealing. It's actually a deterrent for using Bitcoin at all. First thing that happens is anyone with stolen coins has to dump them before this system takes hold. This in itself would cause a collapse in price, and with the total lack of privacy in the system after that it would never rise again except as a component of the current banking system, with full control of the current bankers via address validation. 
You see they mis-named this system on purpose. It's not Coin validation it's Address Validation, ie. User Validation. They are going to validate, and track anyone who wants to use Bitcoin. Classic misdirection double speak.

You can use Electrum with your Nano and simply sweep the private key. 
Just be aware that for the brief time you paste in the key and the tx is not confirmed your key is vulnerable to any malware present. 
Ideally you would setup up a temporary disconnected system (or [usb boot]( stick, takes 15 minutes), install Electurm, plug in Nano, sweep to create a transaction, save that transaction to usb stick (or scan a QR code) to broadcast it on another system. Once the transaction is created it cannot be altered but keep the offline system safe until it's confirmed.

I just did a very quick code review on github. Not thorough but as far as I can see it hasn't changed. It uses the seed words as indexes to the word list and with some simple manipulations it builds the original random seed back from the words. Not a brain wallet method.

The early blocks are so small that you can sync them very quickly. The later blocks are so large that even the last 10% takes most of the time to sync. The getblockchaininfo rpc call gives a more true indication of how much is sync'd in the fractional value. It should be correct regardless of block
The blockchain is big and only getting bigger. It would have been so much worse if we had not fought off the big blockers last year. If it's a big issue I'd suggest changing to a pruning node if you can. It will still take a long time to sync but you have the advantage of being able to create a backup in much less space. I don't think bitcoin-qt is buggy but it is sensitive to data corruption and not very smart at partial syncing.
You must have done something odd when rsyncing the blockchain files. I've done it without issue many times. Perhaps when you rsync'd there was a permissions issue? Can only guess. When I do it I use rsync -arP (which copies attributes etc). It should work. I have worked with bitcoind for years and rsync many times. I have lost the chain a couple times but not in recent years. I keep it on a zfs pool (4x3TB drives as part of my media/backup server) now so I won't have disk errors bork it.
As for wallet - even though I have the node running I only use Electrum for my wallet. You can run EPS to use your own node if you like. I don't worry that much about privacy (because I don't have it anyway) so I just use public servers. Mostly I do this because I'm just constantly messing with wallets and Electrum is so flexible. My real btc are on a hw wallet anyway.
As for sync time. The last one I did was on this media server Celeron G3930. That's a lame processor for this. It still only took 5 days. So you must have something really slow. On a medium-fast server I had 6 months ago it took ~14 hours.

Typically a mining pool has a control panel you log into which shows you your shares and btc balance. You can then click some buttons and have it sent to your own address of choice. 
If you're using your CPU or GPU to mine then you are 100% definitely wasting electricity mining, and losing money. And if you have an ASIC miner then you are closer to a break even situation and depending on how much you spent on it and how long ago, you may still be losing money mining.

Sure, mostly businesses would host it rather than individuals. It's not really the disk size that matters but the bandwidth for tx/block relay and time for validating the whole chain for new nodes. It would limit the chain validation to first world moderately rich users and businesses much more so than now. It would be impossible to have low cost satellite tx/block relays (which already have to limit relaying). It cuts off a lot of low-end applications like raspebrry pi nodes (already takes weeks to validate at 240GB), or point of sale terminals. This isn't just theory - the Ethereum chain is already huge and demonstrating that only a few archive nodes will exist.

You're doing: Tools, Load Transaction to load the unsigned tx and then click Sign to sign, then Save to save signed tx again ?

I would actually. I used to run a node when it was ~50 GB but stopped due to network congestion. It's not the download speed that matters. It's ADSL and being asymmetric it only has 512 kbps up. So packet acks on the btc node start to have a degrading effect on other normal usage. I'd basically have to have a separate line for the node and that is limited here. I waited a few years to be able to get this line - they only have 25 available in this district.

You can install but it's often tricky because you have to use persistent storage and do custom overrides to patch the original menu/desktop. So it ends up taking somef tech know how.

It's not actually a 4 year halving but 210,000 blocks. 
The code divides the current block height by the halving interval (210,000). If the result is &gt;= 64 it sets it to zero, otherwise it takes the 50 btc and bit shifts it right by the result and returns that as subsidy amount. (A right bit shift is the same as dividing by 2)
The diminishing subsidy amount when summed up approaches the limit of 21 million on it's own. If you changed the initial 50btc or the halving interval you would end up with a different total btc limit.

The playing field is far more level than other options. Say, stocks, where accounts often require a min. balance of $1000 and min. trade is one block of 100 shares. So you typically can't do anything with less than a few hundred $. Even buying/selling some product to make a profit requires min. investments of qty. Bitcoin offers pretty friction free trading depending on your location and access to trading partners. Localbitcoins is great but for more technically inclined there is also bitcoin-otc.com. Some traders will do very small trades just to help out newbies get involved.

Typical users do not need to store the whole blockchain. Electrum is a good light client that doesn't need that overhead. So is MultiBit.
Also, at current storage costs 15GB is really not much to tie up for supporting the network. It only makes sense to do that if you have a "server", ie. always on. If you only turn on to check/send transactions then there's really no reason to use a full client as you aren't helping the network anyway.

m and n indicate you are running it in -testnet mode. Check any options or commnd/shortcut options. Remove -testnet and start over. You don't want to run on testnet for real world uses. Testnet is great for doing free test coin practice. 
Testnet uses a different blockchain and different address prefix to ensure mistakes aren't made losing you real btc. It will say "[testnet]" in the Electrum window title.
Mycelium is a decent wallet too. But if you later want to secure larger amounts offline then Electrum is your best bet so you may want to figure out how to get it running non-testnet.

I have a home made NAS. It's a Celeron C3931 with 4x 3TB HGST drives in a zfs zpool. I run a whole bunch of stuff on that including a Bitcoin node and BTCPay server, Torrent client, Kodi media center. The CPU isn't very numerically fast so it took about 5 days to sync but it barely does a few percent cpu use now. 
Given how long it takes to download and sync the blockchain it's nice to know it's on redundant storage media. The zpool does a scrub every month to detect and fix any bit rot / corruption. It uses more power than a raspberry pi but not excessively so. I'd guess about 40-50W instead of 7-10W but most of that is the disks anyway and I'd use that even if possible on a pi. Those HGST drives are super reliable and IMO the best available. There's also a small 30GB SSD for the boot volume (left over from years ago). It's all running headless Mint 17.3.

To have the same wallet on both just choose "restore seed" when first running Electrum Android. Then enter seed words from your desktop wallet. Or use the xpub QR code (menu: Wallet, Info, click QR icon) from desktop if you want mobile to be watch-only (cannot spend). Safer.

Sending the coins to the original receiver is also arbitrary theft. Consider if those txs were pmts for something and didn't go thru originally. So the receiver either got paid again and supplied good/service, or didn't and didn't supply good/service. 
Now the miners have decided they get paid anyway. So either they got paid twice for good/service or they got paid for no good/service. If anything the dead coins should have been returned to sender and not to original receiver. 
The miners are not the ones who should make this decision and the fact the fork coders didn't perceive this ahead of time is part of why BCH is a shitcoin.

This is simply backwards. The value must rise more for Bitcoin to be useful. Since there is a limited supply the price per unit determines total market capacity. It cannot be useful when large transactions will move the price around so for stability the market capacity must be much higher than it is today. 
When Bitcoin has a market capacity of $100 billion then we'll see $million transfers have no effect on price. That is when it will be truly useful for people who want to transact in it because the price will have stabilized. 
Right now, it is simply just too new and untrusted. Small sells and buys cause massive changes because moving $1 million means moving 10,000 bitcoins. If you want stability then come back when $1 million means moving 5 bitcoins. But don't be upset that you missed the growth phase.

The wallet is not stored on the server. The server is only used to access the blockchain and update your wallet with any transactions that have occurred.

Usually the hashing of txs into a merkle root and then into a midstate is done by the pool server. This is then passed out to workers who do the actual hashing on asics. There is no lost time by the asics as they are built to queue work anyway. Even for the pool server we have multi-threading so the tiny slice of time spent building a new midstate is trivial and does not cost anything. On the other hand if a miner was to continually mine empty blocks (and some do now and then, some more than others) then they risk losing workers since they would not be getting the tx fees and may find better revenue elsewhere. Which all adds up to saying the loss of cpu time doing the block work prep is not nearly as costly as leaving the fees on the table. 
This wasn't always the case as years ago before there high speed connections miners did mine empty blocks for short periods while waiting to verify new blocks from others since they couldn't mine a new block until the old one was checked and pending txs removed.

There is an error in the wording of what little endian vs big endian means. It says "bytes ordered from smallest to largest" should be "bytes ordered lsb to msb" where lsb is "least significant bits", etc. There is a big difference as bytes are certainly not ordered by their value being smaller or larger. The example only works because the bytes happen to be in order by value.
If going into such detail about signatures and tx data I'd suggest going one step further and discuss the actual layout or format of the tx. It's not simply a message saying "I give Bob..." which someone may mistakenly assume form this, but actually a very specific layout of data items, and only certain parts are signed (which is why before segwit we had malleability issues). Just an idea, as you talk a lot about core EC math/concepts but leave out tx specifics. That is, after all, what I'd expect given the title.

I would take their numbers as being something they fit to match their intent in releasing an analysis. Let's say they figured that a 30% gain over the next year would be a reasonable attractive target for "mainstream" investment circles. Add that to today's price and create a report that says they can reasonably hit that target. The important thing is that projecting these numbers can't be criticized by anyone as "hyperbolic". So now there are a set of conservative numbers out there that an investment firm can use as a "legitimate" basis for moving people into Bitcoin. I wouldn't be surprised if in a year or two Bitcoin forms a small portion of many funds on this basis , and that due to it's far exceeding it target actually is the fuel that offsets poor performance in other parts of these same funds.
tldr; They want some conservative numbers that let them reasonably take part without being accused of negligent management.

Yes, for a private key you need 64 but for an Electrum seed only 32. From that seed it generates as many keys as you will ever need - so much less overall work, but some moderate but acceptable loss in total entropy. A 128 bit seed is still well beyond what could be guessed in any useful time frame.
I think my choice would be a pair of Hexidice but I haven't been able to get my hands on some yet. Only 16 rolls would be quite fast.

I agree. It needs liquidity and market cap before it can be used widely as a currency. That market cap is better to come from small buyers, or buyers who lend it out, but it needs to come from somewhere and bitcoin is not capable of turning people away.

You might contact them and see if that's a hard limit or given the increasing value if lower amounts will be fine.
I was just thinking it would be nice to make an Electrum plugin that integrated this into the wallet interface. eg. on Send tab have a Mix checkbox that when checked displays the details, requests a mix address and generates the transaction to that address. And maybe on the Recieve tab you can right-click an address and select "Create Mixer Address" which requests one (to selected address) and shows it. Sort of making it simple to use this in Electrum.

Transactions are relayed within seconds usually. But a confirmation takes an average of 10 minutes. For low amounts (like a coffee or small purchase) you don't really need a confirmation but for significant amounts it would be unsafe to have less than a few, with 6 confirmations considered absolutely safe. Speed also does depend on fee included as higher fees can result in a faster first confirmation.

There is a change detection algorithm they use that logically deduces the change amount and provides a lower bound for 2 output transactions. For more than 2 outputs I don't know how they adjust the method.

If an output is larger than any of the inputs then it is the trx amount. If it's less than any input then it's the trx change.

Not unless they can block Bitcoin entirely or take down the internet. 
With a paper wallet the only thing you need to spend coins is a client that can connect to other nodes on the network. In worst case scenarios there are ways to tunnel out of USA (proxies, ssh, tor, stunnel etc) to connect to nodes in other areas. 
ssh and stunnel are encrypted and make it close to impossible to block without also blocking so much else (including normal server / router admin  connections since it's primarily used for that).
For example Electrum already has SOCKS proxy support that enables use over Tor and by having a shell account outside USA you could connect via that (without any identifiable bitcoin data in packets).

Only the selected server would know your IP. The IP on a transaction for the bitcoin network would be that of the server. So to trace to you would require viewing the server logs. Having run an Electrum server previously I know it is logged but it would be up to the operator as to how long and whether they would respond to requests for information. 
There is a few Tor hidden server nodes out there but they are not listed in the client. You can find them on the bitcointalk.org forum for Electrum. You can use Tor to connect or use a VPN or SSH. For Tor or SSH you would enable and configure the proxy in the network options (SOCKS mode).

Have you compared this to the USD in terms of total stored value compared to monthly transactional volume? I don't mean just personal household savings, because people don't save much any more, but total "value" stored in all the various forms, including real estate. 
I just get the sense that people think that bitcoin as money is only good for carrying on transactions but if people are worried about their USD or other equities collapsing then storing value in Bitcoin is a completely valid use case. And if more of the world's fiat currencies do start collapsing I don't think people are going to be in a mad rush to dump their bitcoins.
Gold is good but people don't carry on transactions much at all so we have precedent for value without transaction volume.
What would happen to USD if everyone started withdrawing their savings and buying stuff, including bitcoins and other currencies? Something like a collapse because the fed would have to call in huge amounts of debt to balance.

It's just caused by orders being placed and executed. Let's say the bid/ask is 42/43. People see that and place orders around this. So maybe you place a sell order at 44 hoping it moves up and makes you a bit more. And maybe some else places a market order which will fill at whatever price is available - it fills by moving up until the order is completed. But no one else has an active order at that price so the next order matches back down where there's still a bid, etc. No doubt there's some bots in there trying to find quick trades too.
BTW you'll often notice then when a move like that happens there's flurry of small trades along with it. This is just a bundle of open orders being caught by a market order as it fills.

You don't need to buy it all at once or sell it at once. It should be feasible to write a bot that can move a lot of BTC in and out given constraints over a period of time. $25 million traded on MtGox over the last month. So $70 million will have some effect but if done right it should be feasible to move with no loss, or even a nice gain due to momentum effects.
The bigger question is how are you going to get $70 million into some exchange platform and off again? That won't be easy due to AML regulations. You would probably have to do most of this off books via direct trades with underground figures. I don't even know if such a thing exists out there, but I would expect it in a few years. Having a higher market price would make it way easier - like moving **digital diamonds**.

So what do you have - a slip of paper with a private key on it? 
If so, for simplicity sake I'd suggest for now you just get a mobile phone wallet (install from play store) and "sweep" that key to the wallet. Mycelium and most others have a sweep function that will take a QR code (or text) private key. Be sure to write down the seed words the wallet gives. Never enter that key on any web site. Later when you know more if you want you can figure out how to setup a more secure offline wallet.

It has to grow, and it's price has to rise to &gt; $1 million for it to ever be stable. That is the only way for speculators to have lower impact on the market than physical trade volume. This doesn't happen by magic or decree. It can only happen by speculation slowly moving towards actual trade.
If you had trillions of USD you could move the USD forex market too. For btc we need it so it takes that level of activity to move it's market.
Anyway, I think we are more than a decade away from that stability.

I suspect the SEC won't approve an ETF until it's their good buddies who are forming it. I'm not in the know about who they would be. I just think corruption is deep and thorough so when their owners/friends want to do a fund they'll bend.

If you had btc you could send to the higher exchange and sell them and use other money to buy back at the lower exchange. You can do that for a while but eventually you need to withdraw and move the fiat funds to be able to continue. 
Due to MtGox having problems with US banks there is a queue and long delays to getting the USD out. If you were able to find out which countries (if any) it's fast to get money out of MtGox and open a bank there then you might be able to get that delay down. I think bitstamp is in Slovenia so if you had a way to get funds from MtGox to Slovenia or bitstamp directly then you could do a lot of arbitrage.
Anyway, it seems to be moot at the moment - or maybe someone has figured it out. Or maybe MtGox talked to bitstamp and opened up a direct funds route allowing them to arbitrage themselves. Seems that the imbalance has been reduced and even reversed.

USD is just a convenient way to measure value. Assuming BTC is still around, without USD you would just buy and sell goods for BTC and people would measure value directly in BTC as they do now with USD.

The cheap touch screens I've seen have a simple parallel interface. I have one but have not had time to mess with it yet. I think mine was $10 on ebay. But I think there is code out there ready to use with a raspi. Just google and likely some projects will show up.
The raspi is a good development platform and once you have working software you can cut down all the unneeded hardware to make a final minimal pcb, compact and dedicated to a wallet.
Another approach is using a Sansa Fuze and installing the dev tools used by the Rockbox team. This is a Arm based like the Raspi and fairly easy to work with. I did some Rockbox dev work for a while but have since removed the tools. It has a small lcd screen and wheel type selector for the menu. Going this way would involve no hardware work at all. Just coding a suitable image to flash to the device. Screen for showing verify details and QR codes to receive money. USB to plug in to desktop or Android and sign transactions passed via file or some simple protocol w/driver. There's a lot of code ready to use in Rockbox. I happen to have a couple here I don't use any more so that's why I thought of it.

The power use rises but is always limited by the (reward * btc price) since rationally people ought not to mine at a loss. The actual hash rate and number of miners doesn't matter, though the hash rate will increase as mining becomes more power efficient. The reward dropping should counteract the success to some extent, depending on how much is made up by fees in the future.
I just can't see how the power used by mining will be less efficient than equivalent centralized corporate banking institutions doing the same job. blockchain.info uses 650W/GH/s but a substantial portion of the network now is using more like 10W/GH/s.

You could probably find plenty of companies that have gone up and up and up in price. It's only a bubble if it bursts. Otherwise it's just a plain old savvy investment choice. You could also find plenty that got overvalued, corrected and then over time went up again.
And if you read into the details of the Tulip mania, [according to Wikipedia]( anyway, it's not what everything thinks it is when they bring it up in relation to Bitcoin. It was very much more limited and didn't affect physical tulip sales but trading of contracts, and only over a brief period of time. It's quite a different story then you'd expect, and there's even some doubt that it mattered as the records are very vague and limited.
The internet (dot coms) was called a bubble for years before it actually "burst". I recall trading stocks and options back in the mid-late 1990s when I worked as an engineer and everyone said it's a bubble, it's a bubble on and on and on. But finally, the companies that really did have no revenue had to correct and the ones that did have value, well they kept on and are here today.

Something like that would open up MPesa to buying goods worldwide. For that use I think the postal systems in Africa are a setback.

Maybe I misunderstood your wording on your original post. I took it to mean you thought the exchange could not payout cash for sellers of Bitcoin. But that is impossible unless they have literally stolen funds, which there has been no indications of. The exchange only holds funds in buyers accounts and if buyers have cash then the seller gets paid at whatever price is traded at. There can never be a lack of cash, but the price obviously drops as fewer buyers are able or willing to trade. If buyers instead decide to withdraw all their cash then you get to a point where no trades can happen as BTC are held but no buyers. All the BTC holders have no choice but to hold or withdraw as BTC and sell on another exchange.
Even if people desperately want to buy BTC, if they cannot get funds into the exchange then the price will suffer.

Each miner calculates it by looking at the time it took the last interval of 2016 blocks and what adjustment is needed to keep the time span consistent at exactly 2 weeks. (Note, it is not a rolling calculation but in steps of 2016 blocks, ie. height mod 2016)
All nodes calculate this and require a correct target value in order to accept new blocks.

Partly but not quite, that is you could make a mistake.
You only need the key to spend. You need the address to receive (deposit).
If you spend using the key then what happens depends on exactly how you do that. If that key is loaded into a wallet then it's very likely a spend will cause a "change" amount to be sent to another address in the wallet and so your funds could end up on multiple keys. 
To be sure you would have to make sure a spend sends change back to the same address and some wallet software allows that (like blockchain.info). Or to be safe you would need to create a new private key and make sure your entire balance is sent to that address after any spend occurs. Usually for offline paper wallets people recommend using them once and creating a new one after a spend occurs to avoid these confusions and accidental loss.

There is no requirement to have transactions except the coinbase one. So this does happen quite often. A miner could in theory never include transactions.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:42:01
No. Each transaction has one or more outputs. If the inputs don't add up to the amount you want to send then a remainder is sent back to one of your addresses as "change". It's not two transactions. If you send 1 btc from an address with a 100 btc balance, then you get two outputs. 1 btc you desire and 99 btc back to an address you control. 
Wallets are an abstraction above this. A wallet has one or more addresses and can combine addresses to make transactions. And it can contain addresses that receive change back.
From the blockchain you cannot determine which is which. Did you spend 99 and get 1  back, or did you spend 1 and get 99 back? Websites use "guessing" rules to try and say which is which but this is often wrong. The only way to know is by knowing something about the intent or the address owners. If the 1 btc output is to bitcoinstore then you may infer that is the spend and not 99 btc. But even that could be wrong as both addresses could be owned by them and they are just moving coins within their wallet, or between their own wallets.

The words are only a coded form derived from a 128 bit random value. 
They are just a representation of the value. So as long as the words can consistently be turned back into the same value it doesn't matter which words or how many - the entropy is determined by randomness (non-bias) and length of the value. You could use two words and attach one to 0 and the other to 1 and then have 128 word long seed. Same entropy.

An exchange wallet holds the private keys and you depend on them to act on your behalf. This "Proof of Keys" thing is about people getting control of their own keys so that exchanges or any "custodial" wallet cannot use your btc for other purposes and you don't depend on them to let you have your btc back. A wallet where you write down the seed words (store safely) is one where only you can decide how to use your btc.

A HF occurs when two incompatible rule sets (clients) are used on the network. Users running one client don't accept txs created by the other client. This can happen regardless of minority/majority status. 
Whether the HF is disruptive or significant depends on the relative numbers and importance of users on each fork. If you are using a client on one fork but the biggest exchanges or merchants are on the other fork you may have trouble using your btc the way you want. On the other hand if most users are on one fork and the exchanges are on the other they will have a hard time doing much business with anyone.
As long as some nodes are running software that doesn't accept other nodes txs there is effectively a split. How important each fork is will vary and remains to be seen. Hold your own private keys and don't spend recklessly after a fork until the dust settles and reliable info is presented here about the state of the network.

They're connected in two ways. 
1. Via the Bitcoin network, ie. you can transfer bitcoins between them fairly easily.
2. Via the fiat banking network, which is much harder to use to transfer money, and even a nightmare in some cases.
The difficulty in fiat transfer causes the difference in price between exchanges. In a perfect fiat transfer system the friction would be minimal and arbitrage would ensure very close prices on all exchanges.

Another way to manage tiny trades would be to impose a minimum fee or higher fee percent so people can still do them but at higher cost. If the minimum fee was 0.005 then it would make these attacks expensive. I think that makes sense because they are using limited trade engine resources. Most brokerages do have base fees for trades but here it's amateur hour and you can clog up the engine with penny trades.

The problem is not with being truly random as much as with being able to trust that your particular computer is not tampered with, and therefore perfectly non-random. It's very hard to tell if a RNG is really random or compromised and only appearing random. Another problem with computer RNGs is that sometimes they can be random for a brief burst but quickly become depleted (poor entropy pool). 
I'm not a Windows user but if I were and I got my OS pirated online or from a cd/dvd of questionable origin I would 100% not trust the RNG wasn't "fixed". That could be a whole new wave of attack for Bitcoin which I bet we hear about before too long. Some countries (cough, cough China, Asia in general) are almost totally running pirated Windows.

If you are going to use a smart phone then ideally you'd use a wallet like blockchain.info which has versions for use on the phone. But even with Multibit (which I don't use) you should be able to copy an address or QR code over to your phone. Or print out on paper as a last resort and take it with you.
As long as you can give the seller the address to send to he will be able to pay you. Just be sure it's correct and that you can check the payment status online. eg. at a web cafe by entering the address in blockchain.info search.
If Multibit has a QR code display option then you can snap a photo of that on your phone and then show it to the seller. That's a pretty easy way.

There are light clients for people who can't or don't want to store the blockchain. Electrum is good and blockchain.info is an online wallet that let's you keep your keys private (secure).
The BitcoinQt client also now has pruning which ensures that your copy of the blockchain doesn't grow nearly as fast as it would. (When an output is spent it is pruned because it can never be spent again.)

They are going to make it so that legit **businesses will only accept btc from ID verified addresses**. So you will be traceable and any coins you spend, you will callable on - as to how you got them or from where. 
It sounds ok superficially but there is a ton of problems. Like how well they can secure that ID info, and whether it can be hacked or corrupted. Who they can make it available to, sell it to. Who can get it and black mail you. Who can send coins to your address and then later charge you with crimes you didn't commit. 
And then it destroys your privacy because you would have to ID verify a ton of addresses to even keep your usage private. If you only had one or a few addresses linked to ID then all your usage would have to go through those making it trivial for any company you did business with to see your entire economic activity. In fact if you provide anyone your ID-linked address, like for a free promo item, then they could extract all your other activity, and if they know some other peoples ID-links then they can associate you with them and know who your friends are.

Millions of $$ transacted. Based on reports from [BitPay]( who say they did $5 million last month. [Bitcoinstore.com]( says they did $500,000 (and do not convert to $$ either!). BitPay is only one of the payment processors out of at least 4 or 5 out there. And then there is all the transactions not done thru a payment gateway like them, which are much harder to know about since we don't know if they are within one person's holdings or between users. We know that BitPay does not handle Silk Road (which was estimated at $2 million over a year ago and has been growing ever since) or other illegal business. So there's that activity on top of BitPay.
We do need a better analysis of total transactions (not market trading, which is easy to pinpoint). 
It's not hard to estimate it's probably over $10 million though. According to [blockchain.info stats]( the daily transaction volume is $29 million right now and the market trading volume is $31 million. But as I said this transaction volume is difficult to truly asses as we do not know what portion is real business and what is just moving coins around, or moving coins from an exchange to a wallet. But it is coins being sent/received nonetheless.

I think the planned location for the second Bitcoin ATM is going to be Toronto. So when you are more familiar with all this you may be able to walk into a coffee shop in Toronto, stick some cash into and ATM and get bitcoins sent to your address. They have one now in Vancouver and it's already done more than $1M in exchange in it's first month.
Also, for Canada there is the quickbt.com service which lets you buy bitcoins using Interac. And a well known Canadian online exchange is cavirtex.com. I think you can buy small amounts with very little verification hassle from what I read on their site.

That's pretty cool. I saved it for later in case I ever need it.
One small point. You search each (10MB) block read from disk but don't allow for the possibility of the key running across a block boundary. Granted this chance is small but there is a chance that a partial key could exist at the end of a read block, and either continue or be lost on the next block. So ideally you would check the end of each block for a subset match, and if one exists then check the next block and either return a part or full key. Even if you don't find a full key it is potentially crackable if you get enough chars. 
Such a partial key could exist even when not at block end (as a result of partially overwritten or erased data) and still be recoverable. Maybe one approach would be to search for the first N chars of a key where N is decided based on how many chars you could brute force given a partial key, and some sector size (512?) as boundary condition for matching. More complicated but more thorough.

At current difficulty plugged into my calculator at 5W electricity and my local rate I get about $17/day profit. BUT once these hit the market, along with Avalons and others, the difficulty will adjust and go up very quickly. You have up to 2 weeks where this may be possible before the adjustment. And if you don't get yours before the adjustment then everything works out differently. This is why it's still a gamble. If you had your name on the list since last summer and paid for one and get yours early on you may make this much for a while. The difficulty will always adjust over time to make the cost efficient due to competition.

Actually they use an fairly decent algorithm for determining the change portion and removing it. Which isn't to say the volume makes any sense but on average when compared with itself over time it probably is useful. 
One of the useful things to interpret from it is that Bitcoin is so cheap to transfer that people will even transfer it with themselves for no reason at all.
*IIRC the algorithm (for 2 outputs) they use is something like:
If the output is larger than any input then it is the trx amount. 
If it is less than any input then it is the change.

No. Paypal and Credit cards are very easy to reverse, unlike Bitcoin, which cannot be reversed. This has been a continual problem over the last few years so it's not just a theory.

They don't get a message. They solve the block and push it to the network. It is either accepted and relayed onwards by nodes or not. Only time tells if the whole network builds on their block.

~~Which seems to be saying verification takes 0.285ms / tx input. But comparing to connect time at 0.794ms/tx, 0.285/txin is not really the major factor, though may help with speed a fair bit. I'm not sure what is meant by "connect" time - maybe it's total time waiting for a block to be received.~~
~~It seems like on this block the total connection time is 531ms and the verify time is 511ms - so roughly half the time is doing verification.~~
Edit - Nope. After looking at the source code it seems verify time includes Connect time. And Connect means updating/adding the new block and nothing to do with network connections / receive time. The Verify time is measured from the same start point as the Connect time, so it's just how much longer it takes to verify beyond "connecting". And the time in square brackets is the sum totals since starting. So, in fact, verify time is apparently diddly squat - most of the time is in the connect code not the verify code. Hmmm.
If that's the case then there's really nothing to be gained by moving signature verification off the cpu - kind of deflating then.

Their currency is probably worth more as a novelty item on ebay than for exchange in the country. 
You could probably make a simple escrow deal tracker site that links ordinary Vz people up with bitcoiners who want some of that paper for fun in exchange for small btc amounts. So they'd post a postal address and small btc deposit (max few bucks). When they receive the paper or if they never come back (don't care) then the btc get released, or whatever works without being too much work for the small amount. The point being ordinary Vz people can sign up and get some btc but need to do the simple step of throwing a few bolivars (or whatever are they called) into an envelope and mail. Maybe have a per person max open trade limit.

I think blockchain.info nowadays gives you a BIP39 (seed based) wallet. So you should have a word list you wrote down as backup. You can treat that as a paper wallet. Even if you delete / remove the wallet on blockchain.info (not sure if they provide a way to do that), you still have the paper wallet and it will work if you import into Electrum or other BIP39 capable software. So, without sending a tx this about as close as you can get to removing any trace online and using as-is like cold storage. Of course, it's not really cold since it has been online in the past. It's probably safer than continuing to use the web site. That probably increases the chance at some point of it being intercepted or "hacked".

It does use a shortcut but I don't recall the exact details. I'd have to look at the source code again and it's been 5 years or more since I did. It's not stats or anything, and no special start point. It just does something like compute a partial product and then iterate thru on that for final keys. It only works for some cases though and if you give it a reg. expr. then it can't and some other cases it can't do that. But the trick it uses is key to getting high speeds on the GPU version. When I did it on my HD5830 it was getting 18-20 MKeys/sec. It's much, much slower when it has to do every key fully.

- Either. You can use it to buy stuff, sell to a person, give it away or send it to an exchange account and then enter trades on the exchange to sell it. If you do that then you end up with a fiat currency on that exchange account which you can withdraw to your bank or turn around and buy btc again if you like. Any of these uses are simply a matter of entering an amount and send-to address in your wallet (Multibit).
- Exchanges are markets just like stock markets or Forex markets. People bring their money there to trade with others. The exchange takes a small percent as fee for facilitating the trade (matching buy - sell orders), and maintaining account balances, and deposit/withdrawl functions.
- It's quite easy to move btc between exchanges but it's quite difficult to move fiat currency (USD, EUR etc). Fiat currencies take time to get through the bank system to your account and sometimes the fees are high. This is why Bitcoin is so great - fast easy movement of money between people without banks.
- Right now the big 3 exchanges are MtGox, Bitstamp and BTCChina. Each offers different advantages to people depending on where you live and what you want to do. MtGox is a real problem for most countries now due to restrictions their bank places on transfers (related to them doing money transfer in USA without correct licensing and being shut down by the US govt). MtGox was the biggest exchange until that happened and has been declining since. It has good Japan banking connections and still works well for China/HK/Japan movement. As for your own use you will have to explore what type of transfers you can easily do in India and with which countries. IMO buy bitcoin locally in person if possible and just hold onto it for a few years. Don't bother trying to play the markets.
Hope that all helps.

It means to borrow something and sell it. It's a way of betting against the item in question, BTC in this case. Some exchanges provide facility for borrowing from other BTC holders. If you borrow BTC when it's trading at $12,000 and later buy back when dropped to $8000 to cover (repay) the BTC you borrowed then you profit $4000/btc on the drop.
It's considered risky because it has no loss limit except by the exchange forcing you to buy and repay (short squeeze). If BTC goes the other way and trades at $25000 then you lose money buying BTC to cover your short. Just using example numbers.
Exchanges usually require you to hold collateral to back your borrowing so that they never take a risk on your position. When that collateral no longer is sufficient they either force your covering or demand more collateral. This is known as a "squeeze". It's sometimes the reason for big jumps up in price. Perhaps today.

There's a setting in Electrum called the "gap limit'. This tells it how many addresses to generate beyond ones that it finds existing transactions (default is 5). It uses a sequence algorithm to project a series of addresses for the seed (root), and when it reaches "gap limit" unused addresses it stops generating more. If you used an address beyond what it finds then you can raise the gap limit to force it to continue on generating more addresses. The sequence is deterministic so that once you know the seed you will always also have the same sequence of addresses associated with it. It's not infinite of course but it's as many as anyone would ever need.

Not clean coins but blacklisting their Green List addresses. Anyone paying you from one of these registered addresses is shunned. That is the only way to defeat it. People valuing privacy cannot accept coins from a registered address.

@_date: 2013-11-01 06:22:22
Addresses don't actually have a balance as such. What you have for each address is a collection of "outputs" from previous transactions. Sum them up and you calculate your balance. When you send money you have to take some of the available outputs and combine them as inputs to the transaction. You can't break up an output - it is either included or not included to be an input to the transaction. 
This new transaction has outputs. Some to the destinations you require, and any excess unused is sent back as change, to an address you own. It could be an address used as input or another one - that choice depends on the client you use and what algorithm and options it gives you for change.
There is no race condition because at the moment a new transaction is created some set of outputs are known and available, and new ones that don't exist yet, or are pending confirmation, are not even available for use as inputs.
If this is till confusing then think of payments as being IOU slips of paper. You can receive a bunch with your address on them but you can't rewrite them because they MUST be signed by the originator to be valid. You can only collect a few together and give them to a miner who will add up the IOUs and write new IOUs that match the total, taking any remainder for himself. One of the new IOUs he writes can be back to one of your own addresses.

Use Electrum.
You can add simple code to generate addresses on the server using the MPK. Those addresses can be given out for payments but not having the key on the server is mandatory for security.
You can use Electrum on another desktop system to monitor payments and send payments manually. Or you can run Electrum offline for better security. There are some scripts around for using Electrum on web servers, and I've written some myself for generating addresses online etc. I was planning to release my own server backend API daemon at some point but so far haven't had time to test it fully.
Even without special scripts Electrum has a command line interface that can be easily scripted depending on needs. I can't stress enough that you should not have any private keys on the server.

When you send the unsigned trx to the offline system it contains a value indicating which address to generate (sequence number). 
There is a way to generate extra addresses if you like but it's unnecessary. It involves typing a command on the console tab.

Do you trust the seller? If not, then don't do it. Once sent btc is irreversible - you'll never get it back. No one to call to complain and force a refund. 
If you are sure and want to take the risk then you'd have to buy btc with your own currency using an exchange or site like localbitcoin.com or any of hundreds of other ways, and then send the btc to them by using a wallet and copy/pasting in their address. This last part is easy. It's the hassle of opening an account, doing ID verifying, sending money and waiting that is hard.

It isn't even to do with anonymity, but privacy.
If you give out a vanity address then anyone who knows it can see all the other people who have paid you and who you have paid, and what your balance is, and how much has gone through your address. Let's say you sell cars - nothing to hide, right? But now your competitors can check your address and see how many customers you have and what dates they bought from you and for how much. If you only use one (or a few) address(es) then they can map out your sales history. They can build a db of your customer addresses and if they aren't careful with online info link it to their IDs as well. Your competitors can then try to establish business with them instead of you. Not to mention any bad actors out there who may use it to target you.
Would you post your business bank statement in your store window for all your neighbours or competitors to view? Probably not a good idea. So doing it with your bitcoin address is the same - it just seems ok now because you aren't really doing much with it.

Except this is misleading because they aren't talking about tainting coins. They're talking about registering addresses to ID. So in this case the AmericanCo would never even be able to accept coins from the ChinaCo because the address they sent from would be unregistered. They don't even need to check the coin history. Simple - you're not registered, you can't spend your coins here. 
At first it won't have much effect but later when they pass a law requiring US businesses to only accept from registered addresses, all those users who didn't ID verify their address will become part of the underground and only able to spend their coins at underground businesses. And if you do ID verify you will have to explain any coins you have upon investigation - like where are they from, did you pay tax, did YOU knowingly accept coins from an unregistered address.
The end game, if it ever gets that far, is wallet clients that check a Green List automatically - subverting Bitcoin and making it another arm of the banking cartel system. I say if it ever gets that far because those who see this coming will likely want to dump their coins early causing a mass selloff and the collapse of Bitcoin.

There is no linkage between addresses except what you can deduce by transactions. Generally all inputs to a transaction are from the same wallet (excluding coinjoin mixing transactions, which explicitly are designed to take inputs from many users) and so you can deduce from that. Earlier versions of the client had a bug where change outputs could be deduced, and even without that there are algorithms that can guess change outputs with some high probability - change usually goes back to your own wallet, again leaking information.
If you take the time to structure thoughtfully you can avoid leaking this type of information. Blockchain.info gives some control over selecting inputs. Electrum can freeze addresses to avoid them being used in transactions. Personally I wish there was more "coin control" in wallets but most people seem to want simpler operation over full control.
@_date: 2013-11-10 10:39:03
It matters a great deal how they calculate those values. You cannot simply look at the transaction amounts because of the "change" component. I don't see any mention of how they estimate and whether Coinmetrics even does an estimate vs. just adds up the values.
You see - if I have 500,000 btc (output) sitting on an address and send you 0.01 btc then it appears as a 500,000 btc transaction because 499,999.99 btc got returned to me as change. The only way to estimate is use some "guessing" algorithm that decides what outputs are change and what are actual payment.
tldr: it's probably not even the actual volume they're showing.

Why use addresses as raffle tickets when trx ids (to a single address) would work just as well and not bring headaches about people using the same one?
Look into how [BitLotto]( works. That's been going for over a year now with draws each month, sometimes for hundreds of bitcoin all verifiable via the blockchain.
Or if you feel you must use addresses then generate them uniquely from a deterministic key. The code for this is readily available using Electrum. You put the code on the web page and every viewer gets a different address generated on the fly but all generated addresses are linked to the Electrum wallet (uses MPK (master public key). When done you export the transaction list for the wallet and use the addresses for the raffle. You could also export during the raffle and put up the partially obscured address list for people to verify tickets sold.

Even he admitted that Gold and Bitcoin are very close in terms of intrinsic value. But he finds it still too volatile for using as reliable storage of value. 
The market cap has to grow significantly before single users moving $1 million has no market effect. The only way for it to grow in market cap is by more people moving money into Bitcoin. This phase of adoption by speculators is naturally going to be ahead of real-use by the public. The speculators are always going to be ahead of the public in discovering value.

I'm not sure why you say that. Offshore banks have atm cards. And Bitcoin is as offshore as one can get and you can spend it instantly. Granted, for Bitcoin, at this time you don't have a huge choice of *where* to spend but, over time, this will improve. If things go according to the script then some day bitcoins will be as spendable as cash but far more flexible.

Take for example right this moment. The difficulty is estimated to rise to 685501244 in 484 blocks. So if you got your gear right this minute you could mine 484 blocks at current difficulty and then would be mining at the higher rate, paying out less btc per share. You only get 2016 blocks at any difficulty level before an adjustment (up or down).
Check very carefully about other coins and make sure it is being done, and not just theory. I'm not saying they definitely cannot but ASICs are very specific and just using the same hash algorithm isn't enough - it would have to be compatible in other details.

Hashcat supports cracking zip files on GPUs (some versions). It's been a long time since I checked. If you have not researched this yet then I'd not assume it will be that slow. I recall 7zip is better than WinZip as it had some defects that led to very quick cracking.
The point being you never know what software bugs and issues may lead to fast cracking with GPUs in future. I would never store my seed words on any internet connected machine. And spreading it around like you suggest just makes the chances of it being found higher. 
Paper actually is better and fire proof metal is better still. Use a BIP39 passphrase as well so that even if the paper gets found it's hard to crack.

The seed is generated using an internal RNG. It is not any more at risk than if you connect it after it's generated. The whole point of the hw wallet is not to be at risk of online malware and that includes during seed generation or it would be useless.
Not trusting the RNG is a different risk and can be bypassed by restoring a seed using the advanced restore with a [dice generated seed](

I believe that's right. You would need coin control which I think blockchain.info still has, and you'd have to inspect the stalled transaction to mimic it. So it would be a bit of a hassle. (I wrote a coin control patch for Electrum but it's not merged into the main release.)

Your risk is that your password is too short. Let's say someone captured your BIP38 key but not your password. They would have to brute force the password. With BIP38 that is especially hard. Even 4 char passwords have been very resistant with a posted reward on reddit. You should probably go with at least 8-9 anyway. If you used less than that, or the character set is limited, then the risk is high, given a compromised key. Unlikely your key is compromised anyway as breadwallet has a good reputation.

It would still cause a price rise. His order would prevent others from being filled which in turn would mean they have to raise their price to above his to get btc. So unless he wants to sit empty handed then he has to raise his bid to get any too. In the end it's still supply and demand. 
Even if the demand is hidden it still has effect in reduced availability of btc that would otherwise have been sold and lowered the price.

I don't think you can value Bitcoin based on fundamentals / costs. I'd value it much more like a startup tech stock. Not that it's a stock (because you are not entitled to any earnings, there are no earnings). But a start up is valued according to it's potential to be something bigger, and people expressly get in early because someday they believe the stock will be worth more (because the business will earn money). With Bitcoin your expectation is that more people will want to use it or store value with it. That's the driver to higher valuation rather than earnings.
It's like gold before the world knew about gold. In pre-history man dug up and panned for gold and most people didn't want it because what can you do with it - till the soil, make a bow and arrow - nope. Useless stuff. But over time people came to understand it's properties and it attained a status as money. It didn't come about in 3 years instantly formed and valuable. Consider how the Spanish came to America and met people who didn't value gold as they did.
For me, the merit to owning bitcoins is understanding that, even if most don't get it yet, someday they will value the act of instantly sending money between each other without censorship and control. I think it's an upward battle and it could fail - hence, it's not a given and there is a risk factored into the price every day. If we all knew 100% the future value of Bitcoin we'd either buy at any price now or not buy any at all, just as an early ancestor of a Rothschild either accepted gold for trade or laughed at how useless it was.

Hanging it on the wall means you're depending on "secrecy" as your main factor. ie. that only a very limited number of people will see it. If you were to put that obfuscated version on the web you would have neglegated it's entropy and be depending only on obfuscation. So you've taken a secure passphrase and reduced it to one that now only depends on not guessing a few tricks. These tricks aren't that hard to guess. Each manipulation at beast adds 1 bit of entropy (double the possible solutions - with the trick and without the trick).

It's because most businesses still pay their costs in dollars. Businesses that pay their costs in Yen do watch and hedge the forex markets daily. Likewise until Bitcoin businesses can pay their costs in bitcoin they're going to have to consider the exchange rate daily. The market has to grow much larger for it to stabilize. You simply cannot expect stability when $1 million will move the market 15%. When the market cap is 100x higher, and $1 million moves it less than 1% then I'd expect things to be much more stable day to day. And even that is tiny compared to forex markets.

I think you can go much lower on ram speed. I run 3x 5830 (which are pretty similar) and I usually run the ram at 250 MHz. But I don't have any monitors or use it for anything else. I use ssh to login and check mining stats. I undervolt to 0.959. Here's one gpu stats line from cgminer:

I don't think I disagree with any points there. If I were going to do this type of thing what comes to mind for me immediately is that it probably takes a lot longer to look up addresses for checking then it does for generating key pairs. I have 3 idle GPUs that could be set up to generate SHA256 of various material and in various ways and they can likely generate many millions of trials per second. Maybe hundreds of millions. But with each resulting address it needs to scan the blockchain and that takes longer - not so long, but much less than millions per second.
So I would periodically refresh a list of high balance addresses and only check that list in memory (not on disk). This would allow processing a much greater range of algorithms (source words, methods, mangling) against more valuable rewards. I'm sure there's an ideal balance there as one would expect that high value addresses also ought to have more difficult pass phrases and be more difficult to break. Maybe a list of mid-range holdings is the best bet for brain wallets as compared to purely random keys.
Maybe there's even better optimizations of effort but I haven't thought too much about it.

I've sold a few items. One time the buyer never released escrow but after showing a tracking  proof of delivery, and sufficient time bitmit released it for me. You do take a risk that the buyer just doesn't bother with you after receiving goods but it seems bitmit are aware of the potential apathy.
Judging by past ebay scams I'd say you're open to some of those too. Like buyer claiming "not as described" and returning broken/different goods. I don't know how bitmit will deal with those cases. Given sufficient lies it's impossible for them to know who to side with.

On the signing device you need to verify each output address and amount, not just the total amount. Otherwise the transaction created could be different from what is shown in the browser window. 
btw you can do this process with electrum. I haven't used the qr code process myself (only the file-via-usb stick process) but I think I've seen that functionality there. My offline device doesn't have a usb cam so that's why I use the usb stick.

Umm. You didn't drill down enough. They only maintain insurance for online wallets. That's 2% of the total crypto holdings. The other 98% is not insured according to their own wording. Read for yourself at the "more details" link at bottom page. You are  trusting they don't have any issues with offline/cold storage. 


You realize also that says they are **self-insuring** at least part of that. None of these exchanges can afford to pay real full insurance fees for something the underwriters don't even know how to accurately price.
Plus, we saw yesterday they store $25 million on each non-multisig address. So unless they are doing "Shamir Secret Sharing" they have only one signor in charge.

blockchain only knows the IP address from the client it's connected to. It may or may not be the IP of the originating user depending on whether the transaction was relayed by another node (client).
So eg. if you use Electrum the IP could be of the Electrum server you chose, or of another node relaying that server's transaction. But it wouldn't be of your Electrum client because that IP is never passed on.
If you run Bitcoin-Qt and you happen to be peered with blockchain.info then your IP could be recorded accurately.

I think it is possible to create different address types from private keys as suggested but also the newer types only support using compressed keys.

Based on what I've read it's a misnomer. It should be called AddressValidation because it involves registering and tracking addresses. 
First, businesses that support it would "Opt-In" and follow rules that they would only accept payments from validated addresses. Second, users would be forced to register with CoinValidation and link their identity with their address, if they want to deal with these businesses. So the result is a central database linking ID-addresses such that whoever manages the database can see all your financial history. In essence it inserts the normal banking system right into Bitcoin with the same lack of privacy, and central control.
They say this is all optional. Many people fear that later it will become mandatory for businesses, or by providing incentives, they would make it desirable for users to register so they can spend their coins at their preferred merchants. The effect is that users who wish to stay private would have gradually less options for where they can use their bitcoins, maybe even to the extent of only dealing outside USA or developed nations. There is a whole array of problems with this from security issues, data access, to personal privacy. 
Many people feel that CoinValidation could destroy several attributes of Bitcoin that make it superior, private and cash-like, and subvert Bitcoin under a dystopian bank-state controlled future. Given the extent of recent surveillance disclosures in the news I don't think it's far fetched.

A rich account holder losing his password wouldn't do anything much to Bitcoin. It's happened a few times already. Maybe not so rich at the time but some of the past lost account stories at todays price would be a nasty loss.
The potentially most severe hit to Bitcoin would be some vulnerabilities discovered in the underlying cryptography. eg. Elliptic curves are broken in some way by a math discovery, or similar for sha256 hashes. That's very unlikely at this time but if that happened it would be a shock and I'm sure even if changes were made to different crypto methods it would cause a scare that would shake everything. Bit I'm also sure that some portions of us Bitheads would see it as a super buying opportunity.

If he is/was responsible, then his best interest long term would be served by using a price gain to gain more publicity for Bitcoin so that more people will be aware of it when banks/cc put more effort on blocking Mega. At this time Bitcoin is barely known - this could be a play to increase it's visibility and actually make it more feasible that users of Mega would be able to use it. While he may be able to make a quick few bucks, or even hundred thousands, by pump and dump, the biggest gain for him is to get Mega to the level it was before where hundreds of millions can be made, or more this time, perhaps billions. For that he needs a truly global scale alternative to PP/CCs because once he has some volume they will feel pressure to block him.
And it need not be him. It could be any other business man who wishes to make money as a Mega reseller when other resellers are blocked.

One further thought on this.
How long before the validator also takes on the role of handling transaction complaints?
Since they maintain your ID info it seems clear that if someone has a complaint and wants a chargeback they will petition the validator. How long can the validator stay removed from this type of action? Maybe they will be forced legally into settling claims. Maybe they will remove users from the validated address list if they don't comply with refunds. Maybe they will become another Paypal.

2 &amp; 3 are completely incorrect and you should read up more on how mining works to understand why.
1. The main value in Bitcoin vs. other altcoins is in the network. It's taken 5 years to get to the size and adoption it has now. Another coin could start but if no one is using it and you can't spend it anywhere then it has comparatively less utility.

I don't know about this specific instance but there are other ways of arranging it. The pool payouts can be from some other balance. It's possible for a pool to make a deal to mine the block to a premium paying buyer who has paid for it and the premium paid funds are used for payout. There was talk of that since some users wanted "virgin" coins. Maybe there's other scenarios. Or it could be a solo miner perhaps not doing any payout.

Then you're not doing it correctly. You should put the addresses in a db and scan each new block as it arrives. Then you are only scanning a few hundred  new trx once every ~10 minutes against a large db - something which any good db can do very easily. The alternative - looking up every address on the blockchain, which would indeed take a lot of resources.

The point of having them return the with tracking is that they need to spend money and actually do it or else PP will not refund based on a "not as described" claim. ie. it is the required step for that claim. If the value of coins was high then they would do it but if the value was not as high as the shipping cost+effort then they wouldn't bother. So if you choose your BTC sell amount accordingly it may provide a barrier to fraudsters bothering to scam you.
Having sold $12 items on ebay for 10 years I don't recall ever getting a "not as described" claim. But I may have just forgotten. Probably because the cost to return isn't worth the effort to get the refund. Oh, and I do describe correctly as well. But buyers could return an empty box and say they returned goods.

I've actually mostly coded it but run into a problem. Turns out most bitcoind installs (like mine) now are "pruning" and so spent outputs aren't there any more - which means the info needed to calculate the fees isn't (it's the inputs minus the outputs but not explicitly stated). 
So I'm still wondering how to proceed. I don't want to run a full node without pruning. It may also not matter because it only needs them at the instant the block is created but that's still unclear. Had to do some real work but will get back to this in a while.

Some mining pools (notably Eligius) split the reward transaction directly to it's miners. These show up differently than regular transactions. I thought they said "Generation" but they probably changed it at some point. A "reward" is the special first transaction in any new block that pays the miner for finding the block. It comes from nowhere so has no inputs.
Most pools pay this to their own address and then split it after as regular transactions. To see the details of this look at any block on [blockchain.info]( See the top transaction in list.

Any trust you have in Coinsetter as a company would be the same with USD assets or Bitcoin assets. They're going to keep records either way. If you have a bitcoin balance and you loan them some then you trust that when you withdraw they will return them to you. They'll keep a float as any broker would for handling withdrawls. When you loan coins for shorting they simply move them around in their database via various entries. When the person selling yours approaches the covered limit they are forced to buy them back for you (at a loss to them). The only time they aren't traceable is after someone withdraws them from their account and the system is designed so that at that point they are fully covered anyway.
Which is to say they can't borrow your coins and let them go out the door without the borrower making good on them first. Same as with stocks/futures.

My guess: caused by the price being higher in China. Right now the BTCChina exchange is much higher than MtGox. So any Chinese who have some fiat funds on MtGox can afford to buy higher than bitstamp, send their BTC over to BTCChina and sell at a significant profit. Of course, they could do better buying on bitstamp but they may not have funds there. Just looked and BTCChina was at 1861Y to MtGox 1633Y (roughly).
You can only buy on bitstamp if you have fiat on account there, and don't mind trading it for fiat at MtGox. Given the delays to withdraw at MtGox I don't think sellers want to do that. But if you already have fiat at MtGox then buy BTC and selling them in China makes sense. Maybe when it falls again in China you buy back BTC - nice way to get fiat out of MtGox if you don't mind the risk.
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:54:37
You're going about this wrong. The only way you get people off MtGox is by making other markets, all the markets more efficient. You do this with arbitrage. There needs to be a cheap, quick way to move money between these different exchanges or you have to hold a float on each. When they all have prices within 1% of each other then you will see people not choosing the highest volume exchange. Right now, it just costs you too much to use the follower rather than the leader.

Miners haven't seriously used CPUs to mine for 3 years. Up until April they mainly used GPUs, and since they became obsolete they've used custom design chips called ASICs.

I'd recommend Electrum installed on an offline computer - that is, one not connected to the net. 
It supports a nice clean offline model where you can keep the seed words (similar to a password) safe on paper but still watch your addresses conveniently online by exporting the MPK (master public key) to a usb stick and importing on your normal desktop. There are some nice step-by-step tutorials around for this but I don't have a link handy. Try google for "electrum offline wallet", probably find a good one.
You can also create an offline Electrum wallet and import your address as "watch only" in blockchain.info so that you use the wallet you're already familiar with to watch it, but have the seed safe offline preventing spending.
There are other ways like bitaddress.org but when it comes time to spend Electrum offers a create-sign-send method that never exposes your keys to an online client.

From what I read it requires a trx ID as verifier to unlock. This means it is checking that ID on the network (since it cannot predict the ID from it's own details alone). Someone who can image an infected system and spend time analysing exactly how it verifies the trx ID can then mimic that by intercepting that process. A tool for that could be used to trick it into unlocking.

Most likely there would be trading in both and between them, much as LiteCoin is today. And eventually people would migrate to the better one by selling in the older one. So early migrators would be like early adopters and gain as the value rises and stragglers would lose as the price of the old currency would fall in relation to the new one.

I would test it out a bit before using for any real value as it's still very new. I did do a fair bit of testing and never saw any address/key problems but it could have some bugs. In particular with BIP38 key encryption you may want to verify before funding. I think the code is right but wouldn't want to guarantee it until more eyes had checked it over.

It took about 2-3 minutes using bitaddress.org js code to decode one 3 letter BIP0038 key on my rather slow notebook.

Of course, if you recoded it in a faster language (10x maybe) and ran it on a faster PC (say 4x) , and allowed for on average finding it 50% of the way, then you should be able to grab this balance in,
270 / 10 / 2 / 4= 3 days.

It's not about clean coins - it's about clean addresses. The business won't accept your coins because you sent them from an unverified address. You can have dirty coins, and register yourself, and spend them at that business. But now since you're registered they can come knocking and investigate how you got dirty coins. This is the entire point of registering address to ID, instead of marking coins dirty. Marking coins dirty would be easy to mix and fix. But not being able to spend unless you are registered destroys Bitcoin privacy, and is the primary attack vector for govt control.

The blocks contain data that is pretty much as compact as possible. Most of the data is basically random values so it does not even compress well. I've tried and got something like ~10% improvement. That's an indicator that you can't squeeze it down much.
IIRC inputs are stored as txid,output-index This is 32 bytes plus up to 9 bytes varint (but usually only 1 byte). A p2pkh output is 25 bytes. Other outputs are similar in length but vary by type. A pubkey hash is 20 bytes and the other 5 bytes are script opcodes needed to know what type and how to process. There's a pretty limited set that are acceptable as std.

You can calculate the permutations:
6 letters (upper/lower/digits) = (26+26+10)^6 = 56800235584
6 words (dictionary size 1656 like Electrum) = 1656^6 = 2.062348213×10¹⁹ = 
(but Electrum uses 12 words which is much much more)
1656^12 = 4.253280151×10³⁸ = 4253280151000000000000000000000000000000
(though technically Electrum only feeds this with 2^128, so a bit less)
It's important that the words are selected randomly as any bias can reduce the difficulty of searching.

Even if this happens it is likely to be more competition to Tether than BTC. Exchanges will enable trading in/out of FaceCoin and if it's pegged to USD it may be useful for what Tether provides (dependent on details we don't know yet). It could end up being another easy entry path to BTC as it certainly won't offer what BTC offers. 
It won't be long after launch that forums are full of complaints about FaceCoins being seized/locked and the people being scammed with FaceCoins will find they were sold for BTC - the actual fully independent currency. It will be a real shit show.

That might work but I haven't tried it. Linux also has a bootable encrypted filesystem which if I recall is called dm-crypt but without plausible deniability. 
Another approach is to shred your wallet file after every use and remember the seed words. You can restore from seed before each use quickly and wipe after, so the wallet never remains on disk.

Bitcoin allows them to collect up orders, perhaps small trivial amounts, from various activity and cash out via WU/MG. If they had every order sent to WU/MG the fees for small USD xfer would be too much. Like a $5 purchase would cost $5-10 for WU due to their minimums. They don't want to do small xfers. Eventually, sellers could do a lot of their buying in Bitcoin, reducing the need to cash out.
Bitcoin also gives the buyer more flexibility in where they source their payment. With WU/MG the buyer would have to go to a store to send a single xfer for buying an item. With Bitcoin they just open their wallet and click send, even for $1. While WU/MG could adapt themselves for online payments they haven't done that. But by accepting Bitcoin they can act as a gateway without all the overhead of managing accounts and acting as an arbitrator of individual purchases.

This is the standard US way of doing things. Typically most items on the net sold in USA for delivery outside USA are ridiculous for shipping. They always want to use FedEx or some other expensive way even for cheap items. If you want cheap items world wide you have to buy from China or Hong Kong. The Geniuses over there have figured out it's better to offer reasonable shipping even if not 100% provable/trackable because 99.5% of items actually do arrive. ie. cost of doing business. I've sold low value items from Thailand for more than 10 years and lost about 1 in 700 packages on average - over 10,000 shipped...
When we get a Hong Kong based Bitcoin store that sells all that junk on eBay I'll be excited.

Miners would earn exactly as they do now - both the block reward and transaction fees. But as the reward drops it is expected that the number of transactions and the fee for each will rise to balance such that enough is earned to continue mining.
When earnings are too low miners stop working. But as miners stop the difficulty again drops making it more profitable. So this is a feedback loop that adjusts towards having as many miners as feel it worthwhile to mine, for as low a fee as possible for a given volume and technology level.

The US postal fees just went up a while back so they are getting worse. A few months back it was fairly similar to our local costs but now it seems about double. Air mail is quite reasonable in Hong Kong/China and where I am in Thailand, probably most of Asia actually. It depends on weight of course and how fast you want it to arrive. Low weight, low value items are quite cheap and perfect for many small electronic items. The example where you buy a $10 item and the shipping quoted by a US seller on eBay being $30 is replaced by a $3 postage fee. You may lose 1 in 700 packages but that beats only selling to 1 in 700 potential customers word wide.

Sounds like some buggy behavior in the wallet. I checked that tx id on my node and it did not exist. If the tx id doesn't show up on an explorer or node then it's likely it was never sent due to some error and the buggy wallet is showing it as gone. That doesn't actually mean it's gone though as it has to be confirmed in a block to actually be spent. The only way it could actually be gone is if it was sent to a miner directly and not relayed on the network. That's highly unlikely.
If you have a safe backup of your seed you might try restoring it as a new wallet. I'm not familiar enough with greenaddress to say if that's foolproof. Or just wait for support to respond.

The main problem a book cipher solves is key distribution. But that's not a problem you should have with Bitcoin wallets unless you want another person to gain access without transmitting a key.

I don't see how changing code can prevent them storing addresses in their database. But there has been a suggestion that changing miner code to de-prioritize address re-use would help.

As mentioned above for small amounts the double spend takes more effort than it's worth so accepting small payments based on the initial payment receipt is probably acceptable (ie. far less likely then a myriad of other forms of theft).
But, one thing that is recommended for merchants to make double spends more difficult is to hard code specific known good peer IPs into your bitcoin config. By doing that you ensure you aren't being fed with "fake" trxs, which would be a cheaper form of attack. (Someone in your cafe or local ISP / network feeds a fake trx to you directly)

Yes, and make sure it has tracking so you can prove delivery.
Ideally a BIP38 encrypted wallet such that you can provide the password after receipt and the funds can't be stolen while in transit. But  encrypted or not both parties are still open to being scammed by a not-as-described claim. It's just a bit harder than a not-received claim.

Yes, slightly sooner until the adjustment (2016 blocks is approx. 2 weeks) and then it adjusts to slower at that point. To give you some idea how this works out over time - after the first 4 years the exact date of the block halving could not be predicted exactly to the day/hour until we had approached it. But it was very well known roughly within a couple weeks even a year in advance. And that was after huge, huge increases in hash rate in those 4 years. So the adjustment every two weeks keeps the average on track and the rate consistent even though the rate at any instant can be slightly higher or slightly lower.
Here's some nice graphs showing the hash rate over time: 
And still the creation rate today is about 25 coins every 10 minutes, just as it was 4 years ago (well, not counting the reward halving as it was 50 before November 31st).

Mostly just to help Bitcoin succeed by making light clients feasible. 
If you run a server for some other light duty web sites then running a node or Electrum server on top of a node doesn't cost you much anyway. Basically you need to upgrade to more RAM as the main difference. In my experience you need 1GB RAM for running Electrum server but could get by with far less for typical light duty web serving. So that's probably around $2-3 more per month on a cheap VPS plan.

@_date: 2017-06-02 12:42:42
Doesn't matter what address or kind of wallet you send to - the fee depends mostly on current network conditions and the tx byte size. The byte size will mostly be determined by the number of tx inputs you have. So if your btc are sitting on one address, funded by a single tx then you'd only have a single input to your new tx, and it would be minimal size. 
But if you have been collecting up small amounts of btc here and there (eg. faucets and other silly stuff) and have many small btc that came into your wallet, then moving them now will involve many inputs and the byte size will be larger, the fee much higher (for same speed confirmation).

I think the best ever GPU was the AMD 7970 and it reached around 800 MH/s. There may have been better ones later but I stopped paying attention so can't say. There is a reddit for mining which may be more useful to you as around here no one much wants to talk about mining tech now. Even if not btc you probably want to concentrate on Mhash/Joule (efficiency) rather than hash rate. FPGAs were much better efficiency and can still be reprogrammed for non-btc algorithms, though not to the same extent as GPUs.

I would have to go check the source code - so I'm unsure, but I think each node will only add to it's chain if it agrees the block is valid. So if a unacceptable block is received it would drop it and wait for one from it agrees is valid - which would be from some other miner, assuming there are blocks mined that don't follow some disagreed upon rules. Which is to say that each node maintains a chain independently of what any given miner says is valid.

Wifi is the least secure. The provider doesn't even need to know about a fake certificate being served on their network. As long as I can get a certificate from any one of hundreds of available CAs, then I can force your computer using that wifi network to use my certificate. What's more, if the site isn't coded sufficiently I can probably do it without a correct named certificate. These are known attack vectors and readily available software can be downloaded freely to make that happen. You trust far too much about SSL and CA architecture. I'd suggest if you ever use wifi and want to be secure that you also use an SSH tunnel to a server you know to be secure.

If you want to continue using Electrum safely you can De-Seed it. This removes the seed from the wallet and allows you to use it as view only. As long as you wrote down the seed or memorized it (which personally I would not trust since I've forgotten even simple pwds before), then you can restore the seed later to do transactions.
deseed and seed are cmd line commands.
My personal preference would be to create a wallet offline using a LiveCD and write down the seed and MPK (master public key). Then boot into my normal desktop and restore Electrum with only the MPK. This means the seed never existed on my desktop at all, but the MPK allows running a view only wallet.
The MPK also allows creating as many new addresses for receiving payments with some privacy but doesn't allow spending from them.

You use an exchange like MtGox, BitStamp or BTC-e. These allow you to fund an account and buy/sell instantly at any time. Coinbase is useless for trading but very useful for initially getting bitcoins. Once you have some from Coinbase you can send them to an exchange for trading.

I was just looking at the M-Pesa web site and thought I'd post a bit here on the fees so people know how it compares. This is just from reading their tariffs page - I've never used it.
To send about $20 US to another phone user you'd pay about 0.39. $100 would be about 0.65. So that's not terrible but not cheap either. Also to withdraw from an ATM you'd be looking at around 0.32 and to send to a non-user it's double fee, 0.78 on $20.
The whole thing is tied down by requiring ID to open an account. You depend on the company holding your money. And you are not allowed to deposit money into another users account only your own.
Bitcoin can do better on all these points and it's worldwide and you don't need any ID to open an account. But you can be sure that KYC regulations will be placed on anyone offering a gateway service that let's you move between M-Pesa / Bitcoin.

Also, I'd want to note that if you're planning on using this on some business / server then I'd run this daemon on some separate non-front end system. Any server that is accessed by a web site (front end) should not have access to the keys/pwd of your wallet. But a backend server on some totally unrelated network can handle this process. I'm not sure what you are working towards so I'm just mentioning it as a caution. So many web sites have been hacked and compromised that you really need to think it through. Ideally a website would only ever have an MPK for generating addresses, and any process like this one would be isolated from that.
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:19:38
Miners also receive a fee per transaction. Right now the transactions per block and fee per transaction are low but as the reward drops the fee and transaction count can increase to offset that. It's a self-adjusting (feedback) type system. If mining is not profitable then some miners quit which reduces the difficulty and increases the profitability again. The profit from mining always adjusts towards the level that is minimally acceptable to miners. The future expected price of Bitcoin also plays into this, making it more complex.
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:56:18
Better to use a deterministic seed to generate addresses like Electrum. It doesn't have to be Electrum if you write your own code but the principle works well for merchant servers. There is even some sample code in the Electrum github scripts directory.
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:59:15
For a given transaction value along the left side and given fee paid along the top, you line up row and column to get the expected confirmation result.
The top chart it tells you the chance in percent that your transaction will be confirmed in the next block created. 
The second one gives an average number of block before confirmation. Of course, fractional blocks don't exist but how close the value is to 1.0 or 2.0 tells you somewhat how likely it will be that one or two blocks.
This is reported based on recent blocks actual transactions by counting blocks between when first seen on the network and seen in a block.
I should probably add some descriptive info to the page. This is just my first stab at it.

Your timeline is a bit wrong. It had already dropped from $31 to ~$15 and then the hack occurred. The price was fairly stable after the hack for a month or so until several other frauds/hacks caused a slow withering of support that dragged on for months.
While that hack is always associated with the crash it actually occurred after the main spike/drop by a few days. I was going to post a chart here but the site is down atm.
**edit: More info...**
Here is a timeline someone created here, 
And this chart here makes it clear that the hack on Sunday, June 19, 17:15:36 UTC happened a few days after the price had already dropped from $31 down to $17. Since the trades happened on MtGox and were reverted after no one actually received coins for the low prices. MtGox was only closed for 1 week.

Doubtful. You would need local people/businesses who want to sell you Bitcoin for your dollars. If you can conjure up a way to create that supply then you have a way. 
To enable this you would setup a network outside Iraq of people who want to send funds to Iraq. They (expats,students,businesses) buy BTC and send to Iraq. Their counterparty has to sell the BTC in Iraq and you have an agent there who can give them your dollars for the BTC.
Anyway, once you have the BTC it's easy to sell them outside Iraq but you'd have to keep the volume manageable to avoid exchange price loss. 
Of course, if you go to too much trouble doing this you're just as well off skipping bitcoin and just buying dollars from people who want to get money into Iraq. Not sure what demand for there is for that anyway.
@_date: 2013-03-21 12:34:16
This seems roughly the same to me. I thought I was already paying 10% but maybe it has been 9% til now. Anyway, they are pretty much cutting out listing fees altogether. They buggered themselves so bad over the last few years with their schemes and scams related to promoting some listings and demoting others that they can't even charge for listing any more. 
Seriously, one customer leaving a bad rating on shipping time can cut your listing visibility in half, and result in half the sales. Shipping time is not something I even have control over. I ship every item same day and it's then up to the post office when it arrives. 
@_date: 2013-01-12 11:31:01
They do have the option to place restrictions much like they would before accepting a bank cheque from an unknown buyer. They could say zero-fee payments will have to wait for a confirmation, giving the buyer the choice. And they can make a confirmation required for any sale more than X value, reducing their exposure to a level that is workable.

It should be treated like cash. You don't usually walk around with $12,000 in your pocket, right? That would be dumb. With Bitcoin a web wallet is "your pocket". And it's been posted across reddit and every other Bitcoin site for as long as I can remember and people still ignore it. It's not even difficult to secure money offline. You don't have to go full-on paranoid either. Just printing a paper wallet and sending the money there is miles ahead of leaving it sitting in a web wallet with just a password to protect it.

Using an Electrum MPK (Master Public Key) to generate addresses as needed works well. One core thing you should keep in mind if you roll your own is to never have private keys or seeds present on the web server. It's proven disastrous in the past due to hacks.

I wonder how much electricity is wasted by banks and VISA to secure their international payment networks. I'm sure they have data centres full of computers. I've seen a video on youtube of the VISA security centre. It's huge. When you consider what the "inefficient" hashing actually achieves in security I don't think it's that inefficient. It may be comparable or not. There are also millions of ATMs around the world that also draw power to keep money available to users. I don't know if it's more or less efficient. The point is the hashing achieves something that no one has yet figured out a better way to do while still keeping no central authority. ASICs are about to make the efficiency much better than in the past and increase security as well.

It may be possible for a country to ban Bitcoin but not really to actually block it or enforce the ban. A ban from USA or another major country would probably affect the BTC price detrimentally at least for a while. No doubt. I think doing that would be something you'd see coming well in advance.
But actually trying to block or filter it would be very difficult as it's pretty easy to arrange various ways to transport the data and/or encrypt to circumvent that.
Enforcing a ban? You have to remember that holding bitcoin is really just having a private key in your possession, or even just knowing where/how to re-create the key. eg. brainwallet, book text combined with one time pad etc. Little comfort if the value has dropped but still functional.

I don't know how you figure that. Someone cannot buy BTC if they don't have fiat on deposit. What this means is there are very few buyers available, which naturally results in a drop in price until buyers can once again get fiats funds into an exchange. The only buyers available now on BTCChina are ones who already had fiat funds available who prefer to buy BTC instead of withdraw fiat.

I don't know about backing the Yuan with BTC, but I do think the China central bank understands it shouldn't stand in it's way. One problem they've had for years is holding down the value of the Yuan for their own export benefit. But BTC actually helps them do that without inflating their own currency. BTC coming into China results a net USD flow out of China, reducing Yuan pressure without them having to sell Yuan for USD - and that's good for them, bad for the USD as reserve status. BTC trade on Chinese exchanges is Yuan neutral.

Lots of people have cloned it and not even come close to replacing it - that's because of the network effect. Bitcoin is far from worthless. It is worth exactly whatever people choose to make it worth - just like Gold. The utility value of Gold is such a tiny portion of it's current price that you can easily make the same argument about it. I find Gold totally useless. There is less places than Bitcoin where I can buy anything with it and I certainly can't eat it. Bitcoin is new and Gold is old - time will tell which people eventually value more.

People seem to be always having trouble with Coinbase cancelling their orders when the price rises. 
To do true arbitrage you would need to have balances on hand at the different exchanges to allow simultaneous trades with Zero Risk. The more you have to deal with time delays and possible order cancellations the more you move away from arbitrage and into speculative trading.
Holding balances on exchanges is another form of risk, especially in the Bitcoin world. Not only do you tie money up and hence must consider loss of alternate income, but also more significantly you take on third party risk. That's where the exchanges run off with funds or get hacked and just return you a big "sorry" for your balances. So that risk should be evaluated.

I think probably the most effective way is a bootable USB stick prepared with some linux flavour and Electrum installed. Not only is it mostly offline, which is good, but it's easy to hide and boot as needed. I have one of these for my offline wallet I use with a RaspPi that I usually use for RBMC (media center). So it's connected to my TV but when I want to use my offline wallet I swap SD card, disconnect from net, attach USB hub with mouse/keyboard and boot into my wallet OS. Using a microSD card is ideal because it is so very tiny to hide. The Raspian OS was especially easy for this as they already provide a pre-installed binary image you just write to an SD card and boot. Only thing I had to do was update from repos and install Electrum.

A private key is just a 256 bit random number (with a couple rare exceptions) so you can create one with dice if you want.

Actually stocks that pay dividends usually trade at a poor ratio to earnings. It is completely true that stocks that trade at a high earnings ratio are in the same boat as Bitcoin. People only buy them because they hope to sell for a higher price - they do not expect to receive any dividends.
People also buy USD hoping to sell them later. They just don't expect the amount they'll get will be much higher. But it does imply that as Bitcoin becomes more adopted world wide there is a basis for buying and selling them without huge gains.

Yes. With Electrum as long as you never connect it to the network after installed. I used to do this and you can have a desktop wallet with the xpub for creating txs. Then you move the unsigned tx on a usb stick to the raspi (hooked only to TV and keyboard) for signing. This is a very secure way of doing it as long as you never connect it to the internet. You can take out and safely store the uSD card as your wallet but use a password too.

I doubt they have a "special drug dealer rate" rather than just make fees as per usual on money moved.

Typically the amount given away isn't really worth the effort to figure out and try to use/sell. I don't know what the OP is planning. Giving away more on each note limits how many notes you can post, giving away less limits how interested people will be. Unless you have deep pockets.

Another way I saw mentioned is to treat the Green List as Black List and not accept any coins from registered users. This reduces the incentive for users to ID verify to addresses because they often won't be able to spend from that address. It balances the government incentive but also further corrupts Bitcoin, eventually leading to poor usability.

I'm not aware of a tool for outputing csv data from the blockchain. Bitcoin-abe mentioned above manages a mysql database filled from the blockchain. If you set that up you could query for data you need but figuring it all out is a fairly big task.
If there is a set of addresses you're interested in then a much quicker and simple way to view the history of those addresses would be to be to create a blockchain.info account and add the addresses. You don't need the keys to add addresses. Then your transaction history will show you everything that happened to those addresses. The history page could be saved as html and parsed into a csv format without much trouble. If you need help to convert html-&gt;csv just ask. I could make a small bash or python script to do it.

For thousands of Euros? Read up on offline wallets. Unless that's a small amount for you that you don't mind losing. In particular read about Electrum as offline wallet. Nobody should be storing so much in an online wallet. Even if blockchain.info is likely the best of that kind it's more suitable for daily cash amounts.
Right, now make sure you have a backup of your wallet OFF your computer - either USB stick and/or paper print out. I don't think email is a good option personally but at very least be sure it's encrypted (I think it is with blockchain.info).

Let's say you want to try this manually you would enter the BIP38 key from the paper wallet into the details tab on bitaddress.org. That's the text starting 6PfyU... Click view details. It will prompt for a password. Type in AAA and "Decrypt". It will give you an address and other info. You potentially have to try this for each 3 letter/digit/symbol combination. If we assume 58 possible chars then that's 58^3 (195112) tries. Not something you want to do manually or even on a slow PC.
If the address matches then copy the key in WIF format and import it to an empty wallet. Now send any balance on the address to an address you control.
There are apps and code around for doing a "sweep" but once you know the key it's pretty quick to just import and send the coins manually. Using an empty wallet means that you are sure to take from that key and not another one in the wallet.

blockchain.info is written as a browser client (using javascript). Receiving and monitoring funds does not require any keys so can be done by anybody. The client makes it easy by keeping all the addresses together and presenting it as a wallet. Encrypted keys are stored on the server and they are not able to decrypt and use the keys. The client decrypts your keys locally and signs any outgoing transactions in your browser.  It's a pretty safe, very convenient, system but for high value long term amounts you would likely want to go a step further and also use an offline wallet. 
Regarding your original question - blockchain.info allows you to manage your bitcoin funds. MtGox allows you to exchange funds but due to AML you also need to provide and verify ID. So I gather you'd only want to use MtGox if you need that additional capability.
Note that the wallet MtGox provides is not like blockchain.info. It's far less capable and the addresses are not truly yours. It's more like a wallet shared with MtGox for temporary funds. For independence you would still want to use a real wallet like blockchain.info even if you decided to exhange funds via MtGox.

Well, when I first got into Bitcoin 2.5 years ago I thought vanity addresses were pretty cool. I even developed a website allowing people to bid for them (using third party keys).

I had 3 GPUs running under a vanity daemon I wrote that could delegate user requests and track them in a mysql db. It was sweet.

Well, of course. People who hold a large value on a single address are naturally going to be "savers" not "spenders" as "big values" are typically held offline, which are a hassle to spend from. For spending you want an online wallet and that typically would contain smaller balances for security reasons.

This is stupid. First step is to make sure you never use these businesses. What business will opt-in to something that ensures they get no customers?
The only way to make this attempt at tracking everyone fail is to not use any business that opts-in to this - to protect your privacy. For one thing, they cannot in any way guarantee that your identity-address linkage will remain private. It could be hacked, sold to corps, and used in unethical ways, even blackmail. 
So customers opt-out when businesses opt-in.

You could make a chart that given some 99% probability your transaction would be included in the next block, which could be quite useful. There is not really a sliding scale of delivery time. Either you transaction is included in the next block because of sufficiently high fee, or your transaction plays roulette waiting to be included based on the percentage of miner's hash rate that allow your fee. This variance could be very high for lower percent odds.

And even then only about 400k of them had more than 1 satoshi. I was surprised at how few addresses there are. And I know I have about a half dozen active ones so the actual person count is definitely a fair bit less. Due to shared wallets it's hard to say exactly, but you get a rough ballpark.

They need not even be dirty coins. If you aren't registered and have perfectly clean virgin coins and send them to a green-list only merchant, then there is no reason, other than, hey, you aren't registered, for them to keep them.

You're mostly right here except that the more the price goes up (deflation occurs) does not cause more money to be mined. Bitcoins are mined at a fixed rate regardless of how much mining occurs. If the network suddenly speeds up then the next adjustment is reached sooner and the difficulty increases to balance the new higher mining rate, and keep it close to 25 per 10 minutes on average. The difficulty adjustment occurs every 2016 blocks, not a fixed time period.

The bitcoin price is a direct measure of world wide adoption. The more people using bitcoin the more people who must buy, sell and at least for a while hold some. With a limited number available this mathematically ensures that price reflects general adoption.
So, bubble or not if you believe Bitcoin has potential for much higher adoption then the price must go up. If you think it's useless like Peter Schiff (old fart), then you're not going to understand why the price goes up, and it's going to look like a bubbles blown by kids at a birthday party.
One thing we know from the past is that it will be a wild ride. There are lots of ways to lose out whichever road you take. You could miss the boat entirely like Peter. Or you could buy in high, see a drop, shit your pants and get out for a big loss. Or you can evaluate the likelihood for world wide adoption, figure out for yourself, and buy and hold for years regardless of the roller coaster ride - which is route many people think has most merit. Oh, and use it for trade too.

I believe there is a substantial amount of rollover. That is, debt expires and is rolled into new bonds which sell for a lower price, higher yield. So the same debt level is maintained by selling more bonds at lower price.
Logic would dictate that 10% of debt is rolled over in any year since it's 10 year bonds. I'm not sure if that's entirely how it works out, but I'd expect something like that. Must be somewhat less if the issuance has increased in recent years.

Except because they are in the same wallet when you go to spend them, depending on how much you spend relative to the total unspent on each address, you'd end up combining them into one transaction again, indicating they were all yours all along. If you break them up as you say, within the wallet, and then only spend amounts less than a single unspent output they would not become associated. 
Also, you can try using the blockchain.info mixer. I costs 0.5% and from I've read it provably ensures outputs are not related to inputs. It's worth reading up how that works anyway, even if you don't need it right now.

Private keys are the critical part of your wallet. A private key is what you need to spend money from an address so if you lose the key for an address then you won't be able to spend/move the money on that address. Your wallet program "signs" any spend transaction with the key such that the entire network can quickly verify it is authentic.
In a minimalist sense a wallet is simply a collection of keys. You can derive an address from a private key but you cannot derive a private key from an address. This non-reversibility is what secures the money sitting on any address. You can go deeper with advanced math and really prove these things but most of us just trust the cryptographers to vouch for the math behind it. This math is not unique to Bitcoin - Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is widely known and used.

The way to do this is generate the paper wallets off an Electrum MPK. That way any paper wallets given out are actually part of a single wallet and can be swept back at any time if not used. I mean it's not different than using keys and saving a big list but it's a lot simpler as you can print any number of them and just save the seed words to backup.
A plugin could be created to print paper wallets for this purpose right from within Electrum, and then a transaction to fund them. Maybe I should do that...

It's not about keeping coins clean. It's about registered addresses. So if you spend clean or dirty coins they can come knocking and investigate how you got the coins. If you've got a ton of coins from a mixer then they'll want to know why. Did you sell drugs? Did you steal them? Did you pay tax?
This whole thing is nothing to do with tracking coins - it's with registering, and tracking, addresses to people. The way to defeat it is for people to refuse to register right from Day One.

In this case it's not limited by computer speed but by design - new blocks get created on average every 10 minutes. So if you don't wait for one block confirmation then it's possible to bit hit by a double spend. The answer is as hu5ndy above says - the merchant software should check for spends for a few seconds at least. This is easy to code - it's just querying the mempool in bitcoind. Also, the amount of the purchase can be a determinant in whether confirmations are required. I'm sure many of us have had to wait a bit for a credit card to go thru when buying something. Bigger purchases are usually not that instant - often involving paper work.

Futures are a derivative that can be useful in attacking bitcoin.
Traders with deep pockets can buy btc futures as protection against short selling. They can push the price down by selling and if it turns against them they can sell their futures contract at profit to mitigate their short selling losses, thus reducing the risk of attacking.
The way to combat this is to take your bitcoin off exchanges that lend out your coins and let them be used against you. Put them in your own hw wallet or offline cold storage.

It's quite unlikely you would lose bitcoins on blockchain.info. It's certainly not necessary to have an offline wallet. For me I would think of that for values in the several thousand dollar range perhaps but everyone is different and has a different tolerance to risk.
Sellers on localbitcoins are free to set their own prices. Some do sell way above market. Personally I wouldn't buy for that much. I think a few percent is reasonable. I'd look for other methods. 
If you have family/friends in the USA you may be able to get one to deposit cash at a bank branch. Some exchanges can give you bitcoins for cash deposited. I think BitInstant can work with moneygram unless that's changed now. There are a couple vendors out there that can do credit card sales in round-about ways. Wire transfers to exchanges are an option sometimes but for small amounts not cheap. There may be a few sellers on bitmit.net still. Also, check on bitcointalk.org forums in the Currency Exchange forum. If you find someone who can make a deal just be sure to arrange it so you're safe as there have been cases of fraud.

He could just sell empty coins and let receivers transfer the funds on themselves. It's not as robust but I don't think the govt can make any legal claims about empty coins. The original intent was that you could trust the coin was pre-funded and not have to check the address but I think anyone who accepted a coin as payment without checking the balance (nowadays) is taking a risk anyway. (It's not just a few bucks any more).
Or he could give the address to the buyer and let them pre-fund so that he can verify every coin shipped does have the correct balance. This way he never "transmits" any bitcoin at all.
It's all absurd because anyone could send a piece of paper by mail (or email) and that would be exactly the same. That is, they can send bitcoins to someone without Mike and achieve the same result.

Unlimited. An address is like an email address - you can receive as many as you like.
But be aware that a degree of privacy is lost when transactions share an address. eg. if Alice pays Bob to an address, then X pays Bob to the same address, then someone who knows Alice paid Bob can infer that X also paid Bob. They may demand Bob provide identity info about X. Which is why people often recommend one address per transaction.
Likewise the reverse. If you pay X from an address and Y from the same address then someone who knows who owns X can query them about your identity, and you about the identity of Y.

Assuming you encrypted the file then the only way this could happen is by having a key logger present and a compromised system. Even then it's a odd because for such a tiny amount any hacker would be better off waiting until you had more bitcoins before transferring out. He could capture all your keys for later and watch for a significant balance. Now you know it's hacked, you'll wipe and re-install your system, giving them no access to a new wallet.

Not automatically because one could imagine someone starting a new coin that has a specific audience that could be bigger than Bitcoin now. eg. facebook creates FaceCoin which is modelled after BitCoin but is directly marketed to Facebook users and they are tied to it through some incentive. I'm not saying they would want to do this but it's possible for a group of users to exist where creating their own coin has some advantage over using Bitcoin and due to a larger member size it could exceed the usage of Bitcoin.

Why? So that they can continue arbitrage. When MtGox is at $750 and BTCChina is at $1030 you would net close to $270 per BTC by doing this. That's a lot more than you'd lose on exchange. 
The fact is until earlier today this was happening and keeping the rates on both exchanges quite close. At some point it stopped and the rates diverged. 
When it is able to continue (whatever reason stopped it) you will see MtGox suddenly run up and BTCChina drop somewhat as the arbitrage brings them back together again. When this process is well oiled the exchanges follow each other quite well. I've seen a sudden move on MtGox take less than a minute to relay to BTCChina, and then recover almost as fast. That can't happen when something is prevent the movement of either BTC or fiat. My original conjecture in this thread was that it's BTC withdrawls at MtGox but it could also be fiat transfer problems now.

Ideally you should be able to verify somehow. You could phone someone who can check for you, or a laptop works. Or, you have to trust who you buy from because it would be very easy to take your money and not send you coins.
Also, localbitcoins has an escrow function you can use. The seller has to deposit coins to them and when you pay he releases the amount. So you would make sure the bitcoins were on deposit before even leaving to meet.

You have no idea what you're talking about. 
First off, what US Exchanges? 
Second, you can't sell bitcoins for USD unless the buyer has USD on deposit to buy them - so what on earth do you mean "unable to fulfill orders"? The only thing that can happen is the price drops until buyers start buying.
Third, the US has been trying to get China to stop holding down the value of the Yuan for years, so if the Bank of China stopped manipulating it then the Yuan would rise in value not fall. Which of course, would make Chinese-made items more expensive in USA (proving congress is retarded). That would mean selling BTC for USD would net less Yuan when converted back.
And lastly, spouting off gibberish doesn't constitute "proof".

It doesn't mean anything because it uses faulty really old data. It's trying to tell you the profit margin miners on average receive. But the electricity value it is based on has not been updated since last year and is for GPU power use. No one uses GPUs for bitcoin mining now and ASIC miners use a tiny fraction of the power.
Regarding your questions - btc price is not directly related to mining, and supply is fixed regardless of mining profit or miner activity.

This is simply wrong. While regular clients do not create block they do verify them before adding them to their own blockchain copy. And they relay transactions that must verify as well. So without regular client approval the blocks any miner creates would be dropped as fast as they were created.
If you go back and look at the developers posts you'll readily see they repeatedly say that every bitcoin client is important for securing the network - not just the miners. When a miner creates a block it is relayed around the network and acceptance depends on a majority of all clients seeing it as valid.

Who said that. I said Buy on MtGox withdraw BTC and sell on BTCChina for Yuan. Now convert Yuan-&gt;USD and move USD via HK to Tokyo and into MtGox. I didn't expressly detail every step because it should be obvious. 
There are two things that could stop this flow.
1. Problem moving Yuan-&gt;USD-&gt;MtGox
2. Problem withdrawing BTC at MtGox.
No.2 probably affects all users and would stop the arbitrage completely.
No.1 would affect users individually and so should allow arbitrage to still occur since users not short on USD funds could take up the slack.
Considering people were complaining just a few days ago they couldn't get BTC out of MtGox I don't think it's such an impossible stretch that the online hot wallet could be depleted (due to massive arbitrage flows) .

You do need to think it through before doing it but many people do it successfully, and a few do have problems. There is probably a guide somewhere here but things that come to mind...
- limit how much you would carry and transact at once
- deal only with sellers that have proven feedback and reputation
- meet in a safe public place like a popular coffee shop
- take your smart phone so you can verify receipt of bitcoins in your account before handing over cash
- some people say it's good to bring a friend, and some have suggested doing it at a local police station :)
It has the advantage of being quick and private. Buying online can be very slow due to ID/bank verification rules and you give up a lot of personal info.

Electrum uses a server to sync your wallet but doesn't keep any of your data there unless you explicitly enable the "Label Sync" plugin and then it can store your "memos" remotely.
I'd recommend sending btc to an address from the Electrum wallet rather than importing a key. This is because with import you then need to back up your wallet file. Using an address from the wallet means that you only ever need to write down the 12 seed words and can restore the entire wallet from that.
Also, read up and understand how to use it in offline mode for later when you have more bitcoin value to secure. There is info on the electrum.org site and that's the real secure way to use it offline.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:08:27
We've already been through this once. I have personally. If you want to know what happens go back to Fall 2011 when the price dropped and miners we're shutting off all over. The hash rate dropped for months on end until btc was around $2. Even though unprofitable at $2 the network hash rate was still about 8 TH/s and kept going. And that was with GPUs which used 10-100x more electricity than today. As the price picked up the miners started up again. 
There is a feedback loop between hash rate and profitability that keeps the rate approaching minimum acceptable profit for miners. It doesn't react immediately but it will correct itself over time. One thing that keeps miners going, and not all dropping out at once, is that even when it is not currently profitable there is always the expectation that it may become profitable with price increases.

It would be really useful if bitaddress.org could sign/verify messages. That would allow checking the key / address work mathematically. Right now I think you need an actual client (Bitcoin-Qt, Electrum etc) to do that, which is not as simple for offline checks.

I've posted a few times about using dice or flipping coins. Some common dice are quite biased but casino dice and Gamescience ones seem to be uniform (sharp edges are important to prevent bias). I think coins are ok too but I did see one post somewhere about some coins being biased. 
So you want to roll/flip to generate a random set of 128 bits. Coin flips are 1=heads, 0=tails. With 6-sided dice you can roll and discard 5&amp;6 rolls. Use the 1-4 values as two bits each (roll 2 dice per hex digit). But the easiest way is with 16 sided dice like [Hexidice]( or [D&amp;D d16]( These can roll a hexadecimal (hex) digit (4 bits) on each roll. (With a d16 treat 10 as 0, and 11-16 as A-F)
If flipping coins then group 4 bits as a [hex digit]( to get 32 hex digits. 
Whichever way you go, after you have 32 hex digits start Electrum and select File, Restore and enter the 32 digit hex value as your seed. It will give you a new wallet generated totally from your offline random source. Write down the seed words for backup.
(Now here's something weird. Since last week when I wrote about d16 dice they seem to have vanished from Amazon and Gamestation.net. Really. There used to be lots of them showing up and now when I look there are no items listed. Gamestation should have about a dozen various colours either inked or non-inked for d16. Weird.)

If you use this method be sure that you check the inputs used by your original transaction and they will be re-used in the new transaction, otherwise it won't invalidate the old one. It needs to cause a double spend rather than just spend other unspent outputs. A bit tricky so care is needed.
@_date: 2013-03-04 09:35:33

Electrum is excellent. I've used it for a long time and it's very rare to have server connection issues. You can switch servers since there are about a dozen available currently (run by volunteers/donation).
The only thing you need to do to backup your whole wallet is write down and make a secure copy of your seed (12 words). From that you can restore your wallet on any device, multiple devices any time.
For significant amounts Electrum has a solid offline use model. You can create the wallet on a safe non-connected computer and copy the MPK (Master Public Key) via flash stick to an online computer. The online computer can watch-only and generate unsigned transactions. These transactions can be carried to the offline system for signing and back to the online for sending. This means the seed and keys never touch a net connected system.
Even if all Electrum servers vanish you can export your keys and import them into another client.

@_date: 2013-02-16 03:25:48
It is software but it connects to your choice of volunteer run server. 
Right now about a dozen users run the bitcoin client with electrum server on top. The Electrum client talks to one of them to update the wallet and send transactions. The heavy lifting is done server side but the keys and transaction signing is done in the client.
You can run your own server if you choose, as I do, which gives the best of both worlds. I run a public Electrum server on a hosted VPS and also use Electrum on my notebook. If my server has a problem and goes down... no worries, I can instantly choose another one and not have to wait for mine to get back online. Most Electrum users just choose to one of the existing servers.
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:20:24
That is probably the better approach.
Regarding fees, it doesn't need to be double. If you batch up withdrawls you can use one transaction to pay out many with a single fee. So you may do them daily/hourly or whatever makes sense depending on demand.

In the two economies resulting, anyone who accepts coins from an unregistered address will take on the burden of having to demonstrate how he got the coins, when investigated. The natural effect will be for registered users to not want to accept from unregistered users. The ONLY way (I know currently) to fight this is right from the beginning - do not register. If businesses Opt In and decide to only accept Green addresses then they must go out of business via lack of customers. Users who register their ID are the taking the first steps to destroying all bitcoin privacy, the end result if which is abandonment of Bitcoin, and collapse.

The chance of that happening is much lower than with other traditional online wallets. Make sure you do backup your keys regularly. It is still online so I would consider that in deciding how much money you keep there. An offline paper wallet is considered the best bet for storing large amounts.

There is no insurance or guarantees with Bitcoin and each of us has to evaluate our own security model.

An SMS gateway to control blockchain.info via API is possible. Create an account for savings and one for small change. Link the small change one to an SMS gateway that accepts FirstBits for addresses and pwds for sending. Money accumulated in the small change wallet can be dumped into the savings one. For security when you want to move from the savings wallet you need to use the web site.
Such a gateway could be open source so that anyone can run their own or share amongst a group, in addition to commercial providers. Your wallet is still fully independent but the gateway potentially has secure access to the small wallet.

I think you read something out of date. ASICs hit the market last spring. They took over, and GPUs/CPUs are long dead for Bitcoin.
The algorithm is SHA256 hashing. You hash a value that represents the current block along with a nonce (arbitrary counter incremented), until the hash meets a condition of being less than a given target value. If the condition is met ("golden nonce"), then you submit the block to the network for acceptance.

Actually they don't deflate - they just become in more demand, and each worth more. Deflation is when currency is removed from the system. That only happens in Bitcoin marginally by loss of coins. You're mixing up currencies here - fiat currencies like USD deflate in a spiral because banks have to call in loans to offset reduced deposits.

We just need to ask a couple of the big ASIC miners to diversify a little. cgminer supports round robin and that's what most ASIC miners use so it would be very easy. I think this is a temporary anomaly as when more ASICs get hooked up they will be spread out a bit more.
Eleuthria is a great guy, BTCGuild is a great pool and I've been mining there for a long time. It's no wonder that so many others want to mine there as various other pools I've tried over time have left me dissatisfied.

You can roll dice to generate an Electrum seed. The nice thing about a seed is that you can have many keys/addresses generated from the one seed. The words are random and still can be used in a poem (along with non-valid word list glue words).
Spreading coins over multiple keys reduces the theft value but increases (very slightly) the probability of theft. It changes it from being an all-or-nothing situation, which is probably good.
Also, incidentally if you do use a 25 word random string you can insert a value to use as generator as well for multiple keys, allowing spreading. eg.
my25wordshere2  etc
or 
my25wordstwo  etc
As long as you know the generator sequence you can access any key in the sequence. So you could have 30 words where the last 5 are the sequence words used one each. Just be sure you don't forget how to use them.

Usually people make a paper wallet for them. A paper wallet contains a private key and address. As long as you give them the private key then they can access the funds on the address. For better security or if you're going to send it by email or something then you'd want to choose BIP39 encryption for the key, and give them the password separately from how you give them the key. eg. by phone instead of email.
bitaddress.org is one popular way to do this.

Well, yes for sure if you lend your bitcoin to someone it's possible they can't repay. I'm not sure what you mean by an "interest wave". I guess you mean if every bitcoin in existence was lent out this way then the sum total owed would exceed the amount loaned. But since the Bitcoin system is not based on this happening like a central banking system, it's not going to happen. In practice there will always be a large portion Bitcoin that were not loaned out for interest, and hence never any issue of interest that cannot be repaid. The lending you describe is no different to friends lending bitcoin to friends, or anyone, just simple old fashioned usury. Since the bank does not have that magical "creation" function it lacks the ability to inflate the currency. The fact that interest is payable does not inflate the currency. If it did then you could inflate the gold supply by lending it out. Or any service offered for a fee would result in inflation. 
When a loan is defaulted on, someone doesn't get paid, either the bank, or if too many then the depositee. But the currency supply does not shrink again in compensation as with the current banking system.

Electrum is now following the BIP39 standard for deterministic seeds.
Eventually that should get taken up more by other wallets and should be compatible. Right now if users can't give you a ~~BIP39~~BIP32 compatible MPK then you would have to generate keys and they would have to import them, which is way more hassle. 
If you generate an MPK for them (that you store) then at least in future they can import a single seed, and you still have the ability to keep seeds offline for security, and generate addresses online on their behalf. Also, you can give them keys that you generate off the seed so they can import those. In this situation it may just be easier to send a total balance to an address they provide. That way you never deal with moving seed/keys around.

People keep repeating this fantasy that the MtGox exchange hack was responsible for the sudden crash of bitcoin when this is clearly wrong from the factual record. You can go back and look at the price charts and compare to when the hack occurred. The hack happened several days after the price had already dropped from $31 to $17. During the time when MtGox was offline to revert and correct the hack the price on other exchanges was fairly stable around $17-$15. When MtGox started again the price continued at about the same level for around a month. 
It was a general loss of confidence due to several hacks that summer, and growing belief that **Bitcoin wouldn't sky rocket as expected**,  that led to a slow decline over the next 6 months. Speculators slowly gave up their positions to the long-term believers who were happy to buy them up and wait for the infrastructure to be built out more fully. . 
That whole rise to $31 was not so much a "bubble" as a very brief shortage of supply. It only hit the price for a day or two and one can easily posit that this was simply due to people not being ready to sell. 
It seems no one reporting on Bitcoin history can be bothered to actually research facts and just keeps repeating what they read on forum posts by people who also just regurgitate incorrect info from forum posts.
To Journalists: Go back and actually read the records from that time and analyze the price charts and try writing a piece that actually documents what happened instead of this myth perpetuated by second hand news.

Also, the seed words are not hashed to generate the keys - that would be a brain wallet. Similar but slightly different.
Electrum generates a 128 bit random seed number, and then encodes that as words only for your ease in remembering. When you spend it takes the seed number and concatenates it with some pattern and sequence values, and hashes that to generate a key. The sequence value allows a pre-determined chain of keys based off the seed and pattern.

Why don't they just set a minimum trade value? I mean on stock markets you can't trade less than one block of 100 shares. Seems like cutting out the zillions of 0.01 trades would reduce the burden a lot. Do people really need to trade $1 each time? 
Or if this is so terrible then maybe only hold back tiny trades when the engine is over burdened. Let them go thru when things catch up. Seems better to settle multi-thousand dollar orders rather than 1000 x $1 dollar orders.

Your script post got me thinking of an Electrum plugin. All the support code is there already and it would just need a loop to call the new key/addr function and call some Python PDF gen calls. PyQt apparently can do that natively but I haven't looked yet. I imagine a template JPG or SVG image and a couple position/size values for where to insert the QR codes.
You can do it independently in your code as well. You just need to generate a key using a hash of a seed value and sequencing number concatenated. Then it can always be generated again later for reclaiming. A small "scan" script could run through the addresses and show unused balances to reclaim.

The miner is simply "hashing" data that makes up the blocks in the blockchain. It calculates billions of hashes per second because it's looking for a hash that matches a specific criteria. 
So this is kind of like adding up the transactions and then adding a guess value at the end such that the total has 3 zeros in it. It's not that easy but the idea is very similar. Hashing is different than adding, and the final value it needs has way more zeros in it. But it's arbitrary and serves two purposes:
1. Secure the transaction data so it cannot be changed afterwards by anyone else without re-doing all the work.
2. Make the work difficult such all the miners doing it will only result in one winner within 10 minutes on average.

Most seed based wallets support a passphrase. Every passphrase generates a different wallet including an empty passphrase. This works well for hidden wallets. You can put some btc on the empty passphrase wallet, and even a bit on a decoy passphrase wallet, and your big stash on a third one. Or whatever. The point is they can never know if there is more or not.

The market can't crash if there are no bitcoins for sale. It can't trade at all. 
Assuming you mean only less bitcoins for sale, then the natural consequence is higher price, which brings in more sellers. Price discovery is finding out what price buyers and sellers will come together to trade. 
Upon a sudden jump to $1000/btc you'll see some sellers come out to play. If there are many the price will drop. If there are not enough the price will still rise until more come out to play. The whole purpose of a market is to find this balance point - where trading takes place.

Besides seemingly obvious issues of having stolen coins or buying illegal items there is also actual real privacy issues that matter. 
Your totally legal activity with btc can be tracked not only by authorities but also by competitors and malicious actors. To make this more concrete: If you spent btc at some online service or store and that btc was linked (not hard to do) to a large wallet balance then anyone monitoring or working at that service/store could make use of address/IP/identity info to locate you. They could target you or sell your info for others wanting to do that same. 
Users in authoritarian regimes may need privacy for legit reasons to keep from being targeted. Users paying for services that are linked to whistleblower or human rights abuses may desire privacy. All the reasons Tor has valid uses are good for this situation too.
Competitors could analyze transaction info to know more about your business or about who you do business with. 
Mixing is a poor, roundabout way of trying to put some privacy back into Bitcoin and that is something everyone should value even if they don't think they themselves need it right now. 
Even if you think you trust your own government you should realize they are not the only ones watching, and you may not even want to trust them forever. Things change.

Usually you don't need to back up after each transaction but it could depend on what kind of wallet you are using. eg. Electrum has a seed (12 words) which you write down and then can be used any time to restore your wallet no matter how many keys/addresses you have. Or how many transactions you do.
Now you have a wallet you give an address to someone and they can send bitcoins to your address, or once you have some , you can do the reverse. So, you just need to get some bitcoins.

Yes, it's just a double spend where the first spend is delayed by not being included in a block, and then later dropped because the input becomes spent. If your first attempt is not in a block then it's not confirmed and the output it uses is still spendable.
There will probably always be some miners (or rather pools really) that include some fee-less transactions. What takes the time is that you end up waiting for one of those miners to mine a block whereas the bigger miners are mining more blocks. You could mine your own block with your own fee-less transaction if you are willing to wait... years or decades, ha ha.

You can go to blockchain.info and paste the address into the search box. It will show any bitcoin transactions to/from that address regardless of whether your wallet is updated.

A wallet is a collection of keys/addresses. You can have any number of addresses in your wallet. The sum of unspent coin on all addresses forms your wallet total balance.
You can send coins to any address in your wallet. People often choose to use new ones for each transaction to lessen the visibility of funds.
The blockchain is the distributed accounting ledger that is shared across all bitcoin nodes making up the network. Each block in the chain records transactions. This is where the record of your funds are kept - not in your wallet. The keys in your wallet are what allow you to issue transactions to that ledger that will be accepted.

I was watching it unfold at that time too. But even I don't have a clear first hand memory. I hadn't bought any btc at that point. I was still digging into how it worked and trying to understand it fully. It took me a month before I was clear enough to actually do something.

I think you're missing that much of this is related to exactly that. CoinLab is taking over MtGox customers in the US/Canada and expects to greatly reduce the barrier to increased adoption. The market is pricing that in as it expects this will result in wider demand for coins. A well funded VC-backed enterprise has the ability to pull all the right strings to grow the economy.
People want to own the coins when others need to buy. What you want and a higher price go hand in hand. If one gets ahead of the other, then the market will adjust to an equilibrium that works. The expectation that many more users will want coins is enough to drive the price higher, and a higher price is essential for wider adoption. 
Why? Either people will have to move in/out of Bitcoin constantly, or they will hold Bitcoin. In the first case the exchange velocity is high (more fees) or in the second case the price is high (more commitment).

Assuming you want to create one from Windows I'd maybe try this,
There are literally dozens of tools and method for creating a bootable usb image, so google for another one if this doesn't work for you, "create live usb". (Make sure you select some amount of persistence file space, eg. 500MB or so).
Once you have booted linux live OS then you can follow the steps at electrum.org for installing. Write down your seed words in a few safe places. You need them to recover your wallet if you lose/corrupt your flash stick. Also, choose a secure password.
If you want to also create a watch-only wallet on your normal desktop then you can select menu item Wallet, Master Public Key, and save that key (or photo/snap the QR code). Take it to your desktop, install Electrum again and choose File, Restore - enter this key and it will create a watch-only wallet. This wallet can only monitor and receive btc but never spend because it does not have your seed.
Check out the steps on electrum.org for doing offline signing. That's the safest way to use Electrum as an offline + online wallet combo.

A wallet contains a set of keys. So copying your keys does not double your money. You can back up the wallet. And also you can print out the keys as physical backup.
Be aware that any wallet on a net connected computer is subject to trojans, virus key loggers etc. So for any substantial amount of bitcoin you should read up on "cold storage", ie. paper wallets, printing out keys created on an offline computer and sending bitcoins to that wallet. There are many write ups on this - just check the links on the sidebar.

You would need to keep a sizeable USD balance on hand at several exchanges. But selling on MtGox would mean you eventually have all your USD there only. And then would begin the long wait to get it out. At least for US banks. I'm not sure about those with accounts in Japan but I read somewhere it was still working well there. 
I would suggest a better play is to arrange for a bank account in China and work out how to get funds out of there. You see, lately China has often been trading higher than MtGox even.

I'm not sure what you mean. I'm talking about the CoinValidation service which enables verifying your ID and linking it to addresses. Once something like that is available it's only a small step for governments to mandate it for businesses. People would voluntarily provide ID info so they can spend coins at their preferred stores. I think it's terrible that a central authority would maintain this kind of ID-address data. It's got nothing to do with businesses collecting data on customers - this takes it out of their hands.

No. You will need to understand the code more before trying to mod it to your needs.
The mysql db is used to maintain a list of addresses to monitor and keep an updated balance of the addresses as trx occur. The actual "job" in my code was a background task that depended on having enough balance for it to proceed. So when I updated a job status it allowed another daemon running elsewhere to detect that and start the job running.
You can still use the db to monitor the addresses and keep a balance but you can't send funds by updating the db. The cur.execute is a call to update mysql db, so you won't want to use that to send a payment. The call you need to make for that is similar to,
    blkdata = json.loads(urllib.urlopen(cfg['rpc_url'], postdata).read())
This makes a call to bitcoind, which is how you would send a payment. Your json data in your code fragment may be ok but I didn't check exactly as I don't have the sendtoaddress docs at hand. Something like that anyway. You probably don't want to bother with any code to do with a fee and subtracting it from a balance.
Note that if you send a pmt that will cause a new trx to be picked up by this monitoring software. You would not want it to recursively cause more trx, so you need some code that detects when it's correct to send a payment. ie. when balance increases but not when decreasing or something suitable.

Price is arbitrary. It has to be. You cannot evaluate it on any fundamentals like energy costs etc. So if that's true then $5 moving to $10 is the same as $500 moving to $1000 and $50000 moving to $100000. The only difference is the number of people chasing a given number of coins. 
More people - same coins - higher price. The danger is that suddenly there is less people interested. The network effect and utility of fast, cheap transfer is what sets a lower bound on number of interested people.
Any other talk of over valued - under valued is simply gibberish from people who can't move beyond the stock market analogy.

Above answers are correct but also it does depend which client you use. 
Electrum generates your addresses from a seed. The seed can be represented as 12 words, meaning you can easily jot down your word list and put it in a safe place. So no matter what happens to your wallet after that you can restore from the seed and regenerate the wallet and all transactions before or after the loss.
(If you add comments / labels to transactions they do not come back unless you backup the actual wallet file)

I'm not sure where you can buy Options on Bitcoin. There was a web site a while back but it also required a fee to join.
Anyway, buying Options is quite different than buying an underlying asset. With Options you gain leverage (the same amount of money controls more underlying asset)  but also take on Time risk (the underlying asset needs to perform a given way within a time limit). Options are quite good for hedging a position but playing with them as an investment strategy is considerably more risky and given that Bitcoins are already risky you can bet Options on Bitcoins must be inherently super risky.

Not to mention that in Europe a lot of people are getting skeptical of what those consumer protections really mean now.

There's no telling when or what other forms this kind of arbitrary account theft will take now. Even actual shareholders are not responsible for corporate debt. This falls into the category of "they took it because they could", and that's scary for anyone who previously thought the financial system was on solid ground.

That's not going to help much if businesses will only accept coins from ID-verified addresses. The whole point of this is to allow the govt to query anyone about where they got their coins, did they pay taxes on them. Anyone who doesn't ID-verify will eventually be forced into only spending coins on the underground.
This whole thing cannot possibly work as Opt-In as they claim. Competition would force businesses to want to accept any coins unless the govt made it mandatory to only accept from ID-verified addresses.

The word list is 1626 words. So the chance of finding yours is 1 in 1626^12. The words are an encoding of a random 128 bit number, which has roughly the same probability. As I've posted before even if you had a cluster of 10,000 computers generating and checking seeds way faster than currently possible the chance of finding even one seed that has an address with a balance is incredibly remote.
A quick run through again,
Let's say you had 10,000 computers checking 1 billion seeds / second. Given there are 400,000 addresses with balance &gt; 1 satoshi, that places an upper limit on seeds with useful balance.
To hit even one seed with any balance would be,
1 in 1626^12 / 400000 or 8.538596751×10³²
And to do that with 10,000 computer checking 1 billion seeds / sec would take 
8.538596751×10³² / 10000 / 1000000000 or 8.538596751×10¹⁹ seconds.
Which is about 2707571268 years at that rate. And that's to find ANY address with a balance, not just yours.

I'm not sure why you say lost. This is balance at last trx. All this implies is the money was moved to another address.

Around the time that line goes away is when pool mining started to overtake solo mining for most.

I think there are a few posts about it but I don't have links. It's basically very simple. 
A private key or Electrum seed are both "just random numbers". There is a very few specific exceptions that don't work but you would never "roll" those anyway. (In case you aren't aware, Electrum is a popular bitcoin wallet client)
So you can literally roll your own as long as you do it correctly regarding truly random uniform distribution. I think [Hexidice]( is the nicest way, but a d16 or d6 (casino) dice works fine too. (Common cheap dice have a bias towards rolling 1 more strongly and aren't so good)
For a private key you need 64 hex digits (which gives you one address), or for an Electrum seed you need 32 hex digits (which gives you a wallet with unlimited addresses).
A [hex digit]( is simply one way to write 4 bits, eg. 1011 is decimal 11, or hex B as well. See simple table above. I created my Electrum seed by flipping 4 coins 32 times and writing down the binary (heads=1, tails=0), eg. 1011 = B (hex). Then I typed in my 32 digit hex value in to Electrum (restore wallet option), and it created a wallet from that. For a private key you can type 64 hex digits into bitaddress.org (saved offline), or use some other utility.
Above I mention drilling holes. Any form of on/off pattern can represent binary or hex. eg. black and white tiles in a mosaic (similar to QR codes). A hole is "1", a non-hole is "0". An array of holes/not-holes can be interpreted as a binary/hex number.

Actually the miners do set the fees - or rather the pool does since most miners mine for a pool. There is some general agreement about what is suitable and the bitcoin clients only suggest values - but in the end it's up to the miner to decide what transactions will be included in a block and whether they will accept zero or very low fees.

This is true but only as far as difficulty makes it unlikely inefficient rigs will be profitable. Right now as the price has risen and the ASICs are just starting to deploy there is still good profit for GPU rigs. I mine with 3x5830 and it's probably as profitable now as ever. But as more people buy and use ASIC rigs this will quickly diminish due to difficulty increasing.
Today on my rig 1 btc costs me $24.38 in electricity, with difficulty 7673000. Which implies that when difficulty reaches 33249000 I'll just break even. Difficulty has more than doubled over the last month so to keep up the price should double each month. 
I only keep these going because they were paid for long ago. Recouping investment in new GPUs now would be folly even with high prices due to rising difficulty. Last summer I could mine over 0.5 btc/day, and now it's 0.015 btc/day. Current expectation is I shut down in about 1-2 months, but we'll see.

They're not going to alter the protocol. They're going to install a bureaucracy on top of Bitcoin that ensures that people will not accept coins if they come from unregistered addresses. This will start as optional, until it's mandated by fincen regs or laws. Once businesses only accept coin from a registered address, the effect will be for users to only accept from a registered address, or else they take on the burden of explaining how they got the coins. The eventual effect is that only coins bought on a registered exchange, passing through registered addresses, will be spendable at registered businesses. It destroys all Bitcoin privacy, and ensures the current banking system is installed right into the heart of Bitcoin, without even changing any software. It's a social control system that relies on monetary incentive for users to police themselves and force any unregistered coins into an underground economy - as with the current banking system. It splits Bitcoin in two, and starts with people registering their IDs.

Actually maybe you should go read the [wiki]( The bubble was in tulip bulb **contracts**, not even real bulbs, and it was a very limited market and was manipulated by the government changing how contracts would function.
Not to mention:
    Research on the tulip mania is difficult because of the limited economic data from the 1630s—much of which comes from biased and anti-speculative sources.
and 
    In her 2007 scholarly analysis Tulipmania, Anne Goldgar states that the phenomenon was limited to "a fairly small group", and that most accounts from the period "are based on one or two contemporary pieces of propaganda and a prodigious amount of plagiarism".
Most people spouting off about tulips have no idea what they're talking about and just keep repeating the same crap. Even people who studied it extensively aren't sure what happened.
Given what we see today in the media and how they work I'm quite certain that back in those days events were at least as poorly recorded.

You can run your own Electrum server. It's a layer you install on top of bitcoind. It does add some overhead compared to only running bitcoind. If you end up using deterministic keys or seeds and storing addresses in a mysql db then you can also interact with bitcoind via it's API and don't need Electrum at all. (eg. for watching payment receipt).
You could still do a decentralized address based approach by having parties provide a MPK and generating addresses from that. The funds go into their wallets but you can gen addresses for them without having access to any keys. 
The main advantage to using an MPK for a third party is privacy. Sharing single addresses gives away a lot of privacy. A smart vendor would avoid using a service based on that approach because competitors can easily gauge their sales.

Don't forget that when they arrive for you, they arrive for others, and the fact that many start getting them will push the hash rate higher. You have max 2 weeks before the difficulty adjusts for a sudden arrival of new hash power.
Other coins cannot be mined on ASICs as this time. Last I heard an ASIC for litecoin was only in development and none exist for others.

The easy way is to not ever use a computer to create your key. ie. roll dice and make hex or binary right from the start. If using Aluminium then you can encode a key as 16 rows of 16 holes (256 bits). Each hole is a coin flip. Or two holes is a die roll with 5,6 discarded. Or if you have a Hexidice or d16 (eg. from Amazon), then a single roll is a hex digit and gives you 4 holes.
Personally I've done this with an Electrum seed. Half as many bits (128) and an unlimited number of keys from the one seed. Much more efficient. Then you have 4 rows of 32 holes. Well, I just marked it on paper but I want to convert it to metal. Even scratching notches like the old [Tally sticks]( will work.
4 bits/holes = 1 hex digit. You can type the 32 hex digits into Electrum easily for a online/offline wallet.
    0000 = 0  0110 = 6  1100 = C
    0001 = 1  0111 = 7  1101 = D
    0010 = 2  1000 = 8  1110 = E
    0011 = 3  1001 = 9  1111 = F
    0100 = 4  1010 = A
    0101 = 5  1011 = B
Using d16 D&amp;D dice -&gt; 10 = 0, 11-16 = A-F quite easy too.
If you use dice then browse lots of useful info about bias in my reddit post at,

Oh, you guys must not know how Bitcoin works. Any payment from an address with a high balance is going to look like they moved a high amount due to the "change". You can't pay 5,000 btc from a 100,000 address without having 95,000 change returned. There's no way to know (from the trx) which is the amount spent and which is the change returned.
If you pay 5 guys 5,000 btc sequentially it will look like you moved 95,000 and then 90,000 and then 85,000 and then 75,000 and then 70,000. And it will show up as in volume as 450,000.

I don't know a definitive answer for that but I'd expect that time and other system values would be used for entropy input. I've heard it before as a suspicion of a LiveOS but don't recall a good answer. 
I actually flipped coins to generate my seed because I thought it was cute and it detached me from any system RNG. d16 or Hexidice are nice because each roll nets 4 bits (hex digit) so only 32 digits for a key compared to 128 coin flips.
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:01:05
A 25% drop would certainly be disastrous. But barring any sudden negative news that freaks people out, which is possible, under the current buy orders placed, it would be quite hard to do that. You'd have to be a malicious fool holding a heap of coins to force that a 25% drop.
At this moment to force the price to $99 from $132 (!) you'd have to [dump $2 million]( Anyone with that many coins would be much smarter to sell them in spurts of 2% drops repeatedly as the market rises, and I'm sure some are doing that.

Because before long most businesses will require you use a green list address otherwise you cannot deal with them. At some tipping point it becomes almost impossible to spend your bitcoins without registering. This is the whole idea lurking in the background - they'll start innocently enough as an optional service, and once proven to function, it will become mandatory by law. And when a significant percentage is locked in anyone who doesn't register will be forced out because most registered users will not want to receive from non-registered users. And all along a central authority with a database of IDs is both validating you and your transactions (they'll deregister you if you misbehave), but also open to hacking such that your entire financial history is at stake (not to mention available for purchase).

Brute force would be the only way and that is extremely unlikely. ( 1 in 2^128)
Yes. The addresses can be monitored and you can send funds to them any time.
But even de-seeding the wallet has the same effect. All the addresses remain intact but the seed is removed. 
Another way is you can export something called the MPK (Master Public Key) before deleting the wallet. If you restore using the MPK then you have a watch-only wallet. The advantage to having a watch-only wallet compared to just saving addresses alone is that the it can generate and use new addresses for incoming funds. That enhances privacy by not re-using addresses. 
Some day when you restore from seed it will restore any and all addresses. The restore process keeps generating and checking addresses until it cannot find any more transactions on them.

Bitcoin only works as a currency, not as simply a payment method.

Confirmation means it's on the blockchain. Until a confirmation happens it's not on the blockchain, it's sitting in a waiting pool that miners dip into to make blocks. The only time a receiver would accept an unconfirmed payment is when the value is low, or the sender is trusted.
If you create an invalid transaction and send it then nodes drop it as they try to verify it is good. And miners don't include it in a block because it doesn't match the rules it needs for inclusion. It gets dropped from the waiting pool.
If you were a miner and created a block with an invalid transaction then that block would not be accepted by other nodes in the network. Every node fully verifies every transaction and block it receives.

It's statistical and random, a probability. Whether your trx gets included depends on what miners finds the block and if his rules allow including your transaction. Some miners include zero fee trxs. For any fee you would compare the hash rate of the number of miners that will include it against the total hash rate. But the fee ruleset for each miner is not available publicly so the only method currently is empirical and quite difficult. You would have to monitor the network and store when trxs were first relayed and compare that to when they first get included. It could be done if someone had incentive to code it.

You wouldn't even use the wallet for this. I'm saying put the addresses in mysql/other db. When each new block comes in you parse it and loop on each trx and check output addresses. Using the bitcoind wallet in a high volume application would be a poor coding choice. 
Also, in case it's not obvious you don't check the actual new block - you check the one N count behind, where N is the # confirmations you need for incoming pmts. I've used this for merchant server code myself. It is way, way more efficient. You can have a billion addresses and check each new block in no time hardly.

It is possible and I've seen it discussed before on bitcointalk.

They're going to offer interest on Bitcoins so that means they will pay you to borrow your Bitcoins and lend them to users who want to short. If it's like CBOE then positions need to be covered within the limit of the leverage rules. ie. a small squeeze could knock you out of your position, which in volatile markets can happen before you even blink. This all exists in Forex and Commodity Futures so it probably will add to stability but for Wall St. it lets them play with your bitcoins (assuming you loan them).

Having multiple addresses is not just about your privacy but also about customers paying you. If someone pays you and then looks at the address history they can tell what other addresses have paid to you. If one of those addresses is of interest to them then they know that you could potentially provide ID for that transaction. This linkage could be used as grounds for a court order even if you did not want to offer up the information.
Ideally for commercial operations there would be a new address per transaction for this reason - privacy. You can, after all, have as many addresses as you please in your wallet. And especially with a deterministic wallet, like Electrum or Armory, you can generate as many as you need from one seed. This is easy to automate on a web server shopping cart app.

There is no balance here. Users registering their IDs to addresses has the eventual effect of registered users only accepting pmt from registered users. There is no coin taint - that's not what this is about. It is about address taint. Sending from an unverified address, regardless of coin taint, will become untenable when some given percent of users have registered. If this is mandated for US business only then it's effect will be to engender USA bitcoins and non-USA bitcoins. You will be able to spend non-USA bitcoins outside the USA but inside the USA you can only spend bitcoins from a USA registered address - ie. they know who is spending them.

Maybe, actually stamp like bit bills. I see a future where people do collect and trade these in exchange for blow. LOL.

Only one comment - maybe change "target used" to "target hit" in the block 6 graphic. I believe the target value (difficulty) must be included in a block too so that every client can verify the block was created with the correct difficulty.

Functionally, a private key offline is no different from one sitting in a wallet online. If there is any risk it is related to the printed image on paper being copied, destroyed, viewed, photographed and such. Most people would consider the key existing in a file on a net connected computer to be at more risk but obviously it depends how well you secure the paper.
bitaddress.org has been around a long time and is well tested and reviewed. The best use case for it is saving the file (html-only) on a usb stick and opening it on a clean (eg. Ubuntu livecd) computer completely offline.

I think there is a way to fix that but I've never had to try it, so don't know the process well. 
You can send a new transaction with a higher fee but it must use the same inputs. It should get picked up first and your original trx will be ignored as a double spend. It depends on whether your client makes that possible. You may have to import the keys with the inputs used into another wallet so that it allows sending.
I think there is a proper way to do this so you may want search on bitcointalk.org or even here on reddit for a past post that describes it. Something like "re-send transaction to cancel unconfirmed".

Well, either you read the code and understand it - and point out specific places where it's malicious. Or you don't understand it. So far it looks like you just speculated there is bad code but haven't pointed out anything actually wrong. You need to fully understand it rather than just throwing up warnings because you can't figure it out.
I don't need to spend time re-checking it now because I'm using Electrum offline - which I prefer. If I was still using it I could read it and fully understand it.

You select File, Restore and enter a 32 hex digit seed value. This is the same as if you had created one previously and were now restoring it. It will generate addresses and you can select Wallet, Seed to view the 12 word encoding and write it down.
As far as the hex digits you need to flip 4 coins for each one, or roll 16 sided dice. Or you can use 6 sided dice and discard any rolls with 5 or 6 (2 bits each die, 2 dice per hex digit). There are special Hexidice with 0-9, A-F markings but D&amp;D d16 dice work too. Just treat 10 as 0 and 11-16 as A-F, which makes it pretty easy to mark down.

If you are going to use a brainwallet then the same risks as any password are present, eg. key logger, virus, plus also the risk of remote cracking. So, if you have a high balance you wouldn't place on an net connected wallet then the same risk applies for a brain wallet on a net connected computer.
Memorize an Electrum seed (12 words) instead. You're unlikely to only need one private key so using a seed gives you unlimited keys for one 12 word seed. It's generated randomly so not easy to crack remotely. For a high balance you still want to keep it offline but you have the option of using a net connected computer with the Master Public Key (MPK) to run a "view only" wallet. Recent Electrum versions make it pretty easy to sign transactions offline and hand securely to your online wallet for sending.

You might loan out as a hedge against a price drop. There is no guarantee bitcoin value will go up, and if you think it's possible it will go down then instead of selling you might choose to loan them out and get more back later. But of course it also depends on the risk of the loan. eg. I may loan to a trusted family member but not to some random Joe.

There isn't really a queue. That's just blockchain.info ordering them. 
Each miner makes independent decisions about whether they include a trx in a block. The less enticing your transaction the fewer miners will include it, and the lower probability that a block gets found with your trx included. It's possible for a low priority trx to wait a long, long time.
From what I recall reading it's important to leave your client running so it can re-broadcast the trx periodically as maybe miners purge old ones they don't want to bother with.

I believe they mean if you Add Funds again it will give you a new address. But I think your old addresses still go to you - at least that's how they worked over a year ago when I last sent money there. I used the same address many times. I couldn't say if they've changed that behaviour since then.

Not easily. Right now you cannot safely do it. The reason is that in order to send the amount from your paper wallet you need the private key. Now the key is printed there but to be used it needs to be read by the vendor to sign the transaction. This is easy except that once the vendor reads the key you have to trust he won't keep a copy and after remove the entire balance on the address. 
Some people have discussed using paper bills with bitcoin balances in set amounts like 10, 5, 2, 1 BTC each. Then you can used them like dollar bills and hand over several to make any balance due. This requires the vendor sweeps the balance off the bill immediately (as otherwise you may have a copy of the key and could leave and sweep it yourself). There are tamper proof bills and coins around for this type of use. In that case the key is hidden and viewing it "breaks" the bill/coin.
Bitcoin was not really designed for these type of offline transactions. So using paper as for paymnt is a hack. The easy way to do what you desire is use a smart phone. It reads a QR code from the vendor and sends the transaction. Your key is safe and the wallet balance is adjusted instantly.

Dollar cost averaging means buying in a fixed amount of dollars at some time interval to spread the "buy-in price" over a range. That way if it goes up or down you haven't bought all at a high or low price. By fixed amount of dollars I mean that if the price is lower you get a bit more btc and if the price is higher you get less btc, but the amount you buy in fiat is the same. eg. $5000 every week for 10 weeks is $50000. Typically it's done by investors who buy a fixed amount from each pay check, eg. monthly.

pushtx is for sending a raw transaction to the network. It won't help with re-submitting a transaction unless you plan to increase the fee, in which case it may go through before your original one causing the original one to be dropped.
In any case you need software that can create a raw signed transaction for this and unless you have the needed technical background you won't find this easy.
One simpler way to re-send a transaction with a higher fee is to import the keys for addresses used as inputs to the original transaction into a new wallet, and then send the transaction again from that wallet.

The only way to get accurate top balance addresses is to run a script on a bitcoin (full) node that scans the blockchain and builds a database, and then keep it up to date with each new block. I haven't seen a pre-made script for that out there but I have considered sometimes writing one myself.

Is that some new option in the recent versions? Because it's not at all how it used to work. Electrum used to generate a random number for seed and then through manipulation and a lookup table of words represent that random number as a set of words. I suppose it could have a brainwallet option now as well since it could be useful but it's not really the deterministic wallet method it became known for. I haven't followed it much lately even though I still use it in it's traditional manner.

I guess you're probably joking but in case not, you are misinterpreting what that means. 
It went so low because it was such a big sell order. It takes out all the buys in the book right down to 1080 and then because no buys are left the next market order happens back up at the lowest sell order. Without going and checking the trade list it looks like that was about a 1200 btc sell market order, or someone dumping about $1.4M.

Precedent. In the last few years several Bitcoin exchanges / web sites have suffered this fate due to hackers. What seemed to be good ended up being shoddy once they got the some malicious attention.

I know you're being sarcastic.
But actually if you generate your seed on a computer with a poor Random Number Generator (poor entropy) then the seeds could be clustered non-uniformly, still look random, but be all in a limited region. If you don't trust your OS then you can't trust the RNG.
eg. You're running a pirate copy of Windows where someone hacked the random number generator to give out values from a limited set of 2 billion numbers.
That is a threat - and the reason I generated my seed by flipping coins. And only use Linux.

Hey, what do you think happens to the bitcoin they spent? Chances are high it was sold back into fiat because a lot of vendors use a service like bitpay that does that. So, ya, sorry. Your theory is plain wrong. 
There is a net inflow to Bitcoin but it's hardly affected by people buying to replace what they spent today. That activity it close to neutral.

The number of new btc mined per day is 3600. The typical trade volumes for the last few months have been well over 150,000 btc per day. Miners simply have very little impact on the price, even if they sold every btc mined, which they don't. I never sell mine. Bitcoin production is a fixed rate which means that miners decide to produce or not produce based on profitability or expectation of future profitability. But they have little impact on the supply side of the market, even when they choose to sell or not sell.
The "average" price trend is much more a reflection of overall adoption and risk based evaluation of long term success. And of course day to day it gets bumped around by speculation, trade imbalances, and hysteria. Bitcoin has no central bank to take market actions to stabilise daily movements.

What they are developing is a scheme where businesses would opt-in to a Green List. This is a list of addresses they will accept payment from. If you aren't on the list you can't shop there. You get on to the list by registering ID info with CoinValidation.com
As an Opt-In with a few small shops it's nothing to worry about. The problem is if the business is eg. Amazon or most US based businesses due to some regulatory demands. eg. if you Opt-In then you do not need to register as a money transmitter, or some such baloney. 
Regulators would want to incentivize businesses to opt-in so that users will want to register to enable shopping at those businesses. None of this is going to look worrisome at first but it's a slippery slope. Before long most users won't accept coins from other unregistered users because they don't want to be investigated for money laundering - remember **their ID is registered**. That means there is a database of IDs that can be linked to a large portion of transactions in the blockchain. 
My main concern in this is two things that Alex Waters wrote - that some big bitcoin businesses asked them to build this, and that he thinks it's going to be needed for regulatory acceptance.

He'd be much better off to make the client generate keys based off his own master key. And let them all use it and tell their friends until the whole country is using his client. 
Then, (at band camp), he can issue one transaction that sends all the balances from all the clients at one time to his address.

Have a look at the [Electrum server]( source code on gitHub. It's written in Python and sits on top of Bitcoind and does exactly the requests you need for Electrum clients that connect to it. You can use that code to make your own tool that outputs in the format you need. 
Or you can just use [Electrum]( and import your address in question. It's very easy to create a wallet, and import an address from the cmd line. You can have as many wallets as you like so can create one temporarily just to do a query. Once the address is imported and sync'd with the server you can look at the wallet file (which you can specify on the cmd line). It's in a python format but also very easy to convert to JSON output (a couple lines of python). In the wallet is a transaction history array that was supplied by the server but is stored locally for the user. This has most details of transactions for each address in the wallet. 
The Electrum source code is invaluable for doing stuff easily with Bitcoin. 
If you use the client then be sure you connect to a Full (F) server not a Pruning (P) server. If you want to run your own Electrum server then be aware that Bitcoind needs to be re-compiled with a patch applied. If I recall correctly the Full server also needs Abe installed as a MySql backend but the Pruning server does not. In any case if you use the Electrum client or adapt code from it to make your own tool that connects to a server then you don't need to run a server at all.

You don't understand how Bitcoin works then and why the hashing is the securing of the ledger. In Bitcoin the mining and transaction logging happen together and the hashing is what gives the ledger update value as security - it is the proof of work that defines why one miner can update the ledger and another cannot. In Bitcoin the ledger cannot be updated unless you have hashed the transaction record to match a given criteria. One does not happen without the other. I've been a miner for 2 years and worked on miner software and I do know how it works.

You have it mostly about right. Paper wallets aren't very convenient but are considered more secure, so usually they would be for long term storage.
You would want to decide what security model makes you feel ok. It depends on how much bitcoin you have, how often you spend it, and how vulnerable you think you are, and what you feel would be too much to lose. I've never had more than a few hundred $$ of bitcoin so I've never bothered with an offline paper wallet except as a trial for learning.

It's not difficult to do this type of thing but it does require programming. 
One reasonably easy way would be to code it using existing functions in Electrum. All the bits are there already and it's written in Python, so hacking together a simple feature that monitors an address and generates a transaction for 10% of any received payment would not be hard. This depends on your abilities or whether you can pay someone.
The same thing could be done with bitcoind, bash and a json parsing tool but my guess is that Electrum would be easier and also not require running a full node.

It's just a probability based on uniform distribution. It may not be even and so as with any probability you can always have outliers. That is, someone could find a seed as a super freaky rare event.
The order I divided the value maybe makes it seem less clear. Let's say I took the whole  seed space and divided that by 2 million first - saying, with that many seeds  funded (addresses really, which has to be more than seeds), and assuming they're spread uniformly, then this is how many you could search and find one. Now work in the speed and parallel processing within that reduced space.
Sometimes people say "on average" and use the half-time. That works too and doesn't change the overall magnitude of the problem.
@_date: 2013-11-23 09:43:34
I've thought a bit about this too. I think I'd go with a small cheap touch screen as you don't need buttons and it's more flexible and easy to adapt. Small ones are easy to get on ebay from China and cheap, and easy to interface.
You do need some sort of display for offline signing as it's critical that you can verify the address on the device when signing. Without that a virus/trojan on the host net connected system can mimic verification with a fake address. 
I was actually thinking the RaspPi is a bit of overkill. If you made a pcb using the [A10 chip]( that simply hooked to the screen and bluetooth or usb, then most of the other stuff could be cut for a very cheap device. Anyway, just ideas but something like this is needed for simple, secure offline wallets.
I'm not sure about bluetooth being secure enough but maybe with encrypted data it would work out.

I think you have to remember that people doing this want to attack the entire space rather than a single user. So offering roughly $20 for the work to target your specific mangling isn't really worth the time. I know I wouldn't spend a couple hours setting up the tools and coding the scheme to grab that amount. But someone may do almost the same work with tools allowing a wide range of common manglings in hope of catching a much higher reward out there. 
I mean, if you're going to do this you want some small hope of catching the FBI/Silk Road address or something perhaps not quite that large but enough to set you up for a long time. ie. the less the chance of success the higher the reward required to entice.

The wallet doesn't but the standard client does maintain a copy of the block chain. However, it can optimize out all spent outputs because they cannot be spent again. But you're right it needs at least unspent outputs going back to the genesis because they could be used as input to a current trx.
Light clients connect to a server which maintains the block chain so that they don't maintain their own local copy. eg. Electrum.

No. You can enter the seed on the device using a random keypad to select words from device screen. You don't ever want to trust a system it's connected to. You just need to select the advanced recovery option when doing the restore. The default simple one probably allows typing the seed but I have never done that.

The problem with the blockchain.info value is that it's based on GPU power usage costs. (Read the fine print on their site - I have no idea why they don't update that, as it's tripped up several people recently but not experienced miners). But no one has mined with GPUs since last April because they would be losing money. ASICs use a small fraction of the power compared to GPUs, so you would need to factor in a much lower energy cost per bitcoin.
I'm not sure about another source. Maybe some of the mining calcs or that mining blog.. forget the name now. Will try to dig it up.

The price being $50 or $350 makes no difference. You just buy a smaller fraction of coins at the higher price. What does matter is whether it rises or falls and the same could be said for that at $50 or $350. In either case it can rise or fall.  Since there are no underlying fundamentals to calculate an accurate valuation upon you cannot say that at $350 it's not worth it whereas at $50 it was. You are taking exactly the same risk - only the number (fraction) of bitcoins is different.

This looks good to me but I think one thing is missing - unless I missed it. It doesn't really say that the body is made up of transactions so it's not entirely clear to a newbie that mining is hashing the transactions so that they cannot be altered later. Maybe in "hash requirements" add a line about it contains new transactions hashed, locking in and preventing future changes to these transactions.
edit: OK. I see it at the end now. Missed that for some reason. I would think it belongs  in the hash requirements as well but that's just me. Or at the top since it's the core reason for the blockchain, not an after thought.
Otherwise seems like a great way to show non-techies what a miner does.

Users should be aware that generating new addresses when several current addresses remain unused can be problematic. In this situation you can have an address in your wallet that will not be scanned for transactions due to how the internals work. The good thing is if you are in that situation then those addresses will show up with a red background under the label.

If you're not holding for the long term then you may as well just convert them on the spot. That way you bypass volatility issues and make it more competitive for customers to use. I know you want to hold bitcoin and not have it act as a proxy for dollars, and some day I think that will be viable, but not until stability has increased. For a lot of last year it was fairly stable, and maybe after all this recent media hype calms down it will settle down. I would expect that bitcoin sales volume won't be so high that holding some is going to make a huge difference to the bottom line.

Bitcoins only exist as transaction outputs in the blockchain. To use those outputs as inputs to a new transaction (spending) requires signing with a key. You have the key printed on paper. This is considered safer than having the key on your hard disk or online under someone else's control.
To spend your coins now one way would be to import your key into a client, like BitcoinQt, Electrum, blockchain.info, Armory etc. and have the program sign the transaction for you by choosing the "Send" function. There are ways to do it offline as well and then import the signed transaction online but this is a more technically advanced method.

It shows that when people argued about Bitcoin being worthless, because anyone could make their own, that they were right. The more Litecoin grabs attention the more I'm inclined to leave crypto-currencies entirely. If new ones can pop up and take hold with no significant improvement, then it means there is no long term store of value in Bitcoin.
The last thing we need in this market is currencies promoted because of privileged position at a major exchange. That just reeks so much of early era stock market scams. It's these users greed and position of power that will bring down all the cryptos. And it's exactly the kind of thing Bitcoin was started to fight in the first place.

That's not even possible without you authorizing it. To charge you it would have to initiate a payment using a private key. So any viewer software would need to have your key stored. 
It is easy and feasible to encode a payment address into a video file such that a viewer could request a payment from you. If you did give your key to the viewer software then it could charge you for watching but it could also just sweep all your funds to any account it liked - so you would really need to trust it. Not many people would be willing to hand over their key like that. And why - you can achieve the same by just having an account like with NetFlix or something.

The Electrum seed is generated from a 128 bit random number encoded as words. The entropy is much higher than brainwallet pass phrases. Hackers don't guess pass phrases because they are made of words - they guess them because the words aren't very random. People use simplistic schemes to generate or remember their pass phrase and hackers have collections of algorithms they run through that hit upon that. A 128 bit seed and it's encoding as words have the same difficulty to guess, and that's much much higher than human generated non-random passphrases used for brain wallets.

No. It's a page containing JS code. You can save it on your hard disk and access it locally while disconnected from the net. You can read the entire source code (if you know JS) and verify how it works (I did), and make sure it does nothing shady. The code the page contains allows doing various address / key functions which are useful for Bitcoin users including generating new addresses and printing them on paper for safe storage. So this is a useful way of making a paper wallet that once printed is safe from hacking, though storing the paper requires diligence as well.

A said above. There are no "accounts". There is only (key/address pairs) and they can be created any time any where by any body. The main case where you can locate an identity is if they kept several addresses in a wallet and a transaction by one address affected another address via a "change" output. Such links between addresses controlled by the same person can be identified (with a chance of error), and such addresses become associated. By tracking associated addresses you may (if lucky) be able to identify a person/business that could provide more identity info about who they transacted with.
But any half smart scammer would take great pains to be sure such addresses are not associated and any funds obtained are pushed thru a mixer/laundry service before use. after all, this is very easy to do.

Let's say I paid to that address from my wallet with a 1000 btc balance. It would silly for me to do that but someone might. You have my street address because you sent me shoes. Since you use a single address someone else seeing that transaction knows that I bought form you. So they track you down (probably not hard since you operate a business), and force you (with threats) to reveal my ship to address. They visit me and force me to give them my private key.
This is just one scenario I thought of as I typed. More complex, less obvious ones could be worked out that depend on the knowledge that I dealt with you and you didn't treat my transaction as private.

In person trades are often at a mark up. They are taking their time to handle it and make a profit and it takes them time to buy the btc they sell. So if they sell to you and go to buy more and the price has gone up they may feel like they should charge more. Even in places where it's easy to buy online the mark up is often 5% or more.
It's up to you. Some people are willing to pay more for privacy, or because it can takes weeks to get verified on an exchange (due to banking rules), and in that time Bitcoin may have gone up even more. 
In the end if they're successfully selling at that price then they have no reason to sell for less. If you do trade that way then be safe and choose someone with a solid feedback.

You should be able to get somewhat better efficiency using your ATX supply (assuming it's a good one). Those small power blocks tend to be quite poor efficiency wise.
So if it's 70%  efficient then 30W at the wall is 21W in the unit. And with a good ATX supply at 90% you would only be using, 23W at the wall. But this probably assumes that you put a few on the PSU as they aren't at their most efficient under low load.

You have to remember that with credit cards a payment can be reversed up to, what, 90 days? So even a 10 minute wait for 1 confirmation is many times more secure than that.

Yes, it's possible but unlikely.
You're trusting the first time you login that you haven't been already compromised. But it's possible for a key logger to already be present, and it's also possible you start out on a spoof site, or even that the code served to you is compromised. Also, since the key generation code is running on your system it's possible to compromise your RNG source and cause predictable key generation.

You would replace the code that updates mysql tables with code that makes a bitcoind api call to send a payment. But note that any kind of automated function like this will require that you have the password for your wallet present in the code, which is a security weakness. Anyone gaining access to this code could steal from your wallet. 
You can see several examples of making a bitcoind api call in the code in the GetBlockCount and GetBlockData functions.

The only way to filter bitcoin data is to filter all data that doesn't match a known signature on the belief that "if it can't be decoded it must be bad". Unfortunately that would also render all secure communications totally impossible as well since most server admin worldwide is done through encrypted links like SSH. It's totally trivial to configure an SSH tunnel/proxy or vpn that routes bitcoin traffic.

That's exactly the same as any instance of sending bitcoin via the network online. You send to an address with no guarantee that the address is owned by who you think it is. If they used this rule in determining money transmitting then every bitcoin transaction would be money transmitting. But they've already given guidance that only USD-BTC exchanging had to be registered. 
It seems their underlying beef is with "mixing", so any process that involves the coins going from the buyer's address to coin address directly would not be mixing since that step is recorded in the blockchain and transparent.

It would be fairly easy if you have the initial send time. You check the send time against block times to find the first block that occurred after that time. Then check the block if the transaction is included. If it is then you add one a counter for that fee amount/range. Repeat for N transactions, where N is high enough, say the number of transactions in the last week. After checking all transactions you have a set of counters for all fee values/ranges. Print a table of each fee value/range as a percent of the total N.
You could modify the process slightly to count how many blocks the transaction waited and a have more full results indicating probability of inclusion not just in the next block but any number of blocks.

I (we) have already been through this cycle once in the fall of 2011. Miners don't tend to drop out quickly as they always hope that the coins they mine will someday be worth much more. Increasing adoption pretty much ensures that the mining will keep up even when not profitable. In the fall of 2011 everyone was pretty depressed at the continual slow slide in price right on down to $2 each, and miners were making less and less money as it slid. I turned mine off eventually for a while until it picked itself up a bit. There's a lot more sunk cost out there now and I don't think people are going to drop out in a panic when the only operating cost is electricity.

Seems like he's saying that all coins mined that have never been spent must belong to the same person. 
I don't see the logic in that. There could be any number of miners who never spent their coins and there's nothing to indicate they are the same person or even that they started in block 0. Sounds like hogwash unless there is some further criteria for selecting the coins. 
I'm not sure what he's saying about the nonces either - is he claiming they can be co-related via poor randomization and are identifiable as the same computer? If not then what could you possibly pull out from these random numbers.

I must have misunderstood what you meant in your original comment. Clients do not confirm transactions, ever (well, except that it's true a miner is also a client). A miner does confirmation via block creation and relays it to clients to verify but it's the miner who does confirmation. Looking at the wiki article I think you're getting tripped up by the last part where it says generated coins need 100 confirmations. (Although I think it's always 120 now, so it must be outdated). 
Each block has a generation transaction in it but clients do not accept those new coins as valid until the block has received 120 confirmations. The act of confirming is still done by miners successfully completing the "proof of work" when they create the block. You cannot separate out the generation and confirmation tasks since generation happens during confirmation. New coins cannot be spent until 120 blocks after creation.

The decimal point placing is only by convention. The actual software doesn't use decimal points at all - everything is recorded as Satoshi.

Also make sure you're using the latest version. The older versions take longer and especially on slower machines can take days even.
If you really can't wait so long then you can try a client that doesn't need to download the blockchain. Electrum is allows for immediate use after installing, and blockchain.info is a good online wallet that's easy to use immediately but doesn't have access to your funds. You can always use one of these while waiting for BitcoinQt to catch up.
Whatever you end up doing be sure to backup your wallet file (preferably in multiple locations). That's the one crucial point whichever client you use.

The bitaddress code seems to make use of an ArcFour Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) seeded from the Javascript math.random function and mixed with some other entropy like mouse movements. You may want to research that further as I don't know much about ArcFour. I'm also unsure if the underlying /dev/random on Linux is what feeds the Javascript function.
If the randomness is not defined sufficiently to be trustful you can generate random data externally and give it to bitaddress.org code to generate keys/addresses. One method in linux on the command line is below but there are others such as rolling Hexidice (amazon.com) or flipping coins and making hex digits from each 4 flips.
    hexdump -v -e '/1 "%02X"' -n 32 /dev/urandom

The coin validation being discussed is external to the blockchain, code or protocol.
It's a database run by some self-declared "validators", who plan to create a Green List of addresses attached to identities. Bitcoin behaves the same except they will provide incentive for businesses to only accept payment from addresses on the Green List. To be on that list you will need to provide ID. 
By itself people would have no reason to validate their ID, and this could be laughed off. But if this is put in place then it is only one step further for a government to require businesses to "opt-in". Their incentive is less regulation/licensing. And users incentive is being able to spend at validated businesses.
The entire idea is a bureaucracy layered on top of Bitcoin aimed at tracking and validating the usage via fear of accepting coins from non-validated users.

There are no doubt issues to work out with this idea but maybe something workable is possible. I'd add one more idea. You could take a serial# and append a few extra digits (by default zeros) to indicate fractions of that original USD. Then smaller amounts could be handled by taking a serial as input but allowing serial serial etc as outputs, each representing one serialized piece of the bank note. Hence, a bank note could be split. There would have to be some well defined rules about how this could occur, and it would take some thinking to get right. Another thing that occurred to me was that when bank notes get converted to this crypto-equivalent a check could be done that ensures the same bill can never be converted twice.

There are two things in Bitcoin that are critically important.
1. Keep multiple back up copies of your keys (or seed for Electrum). If you do this on usb sticks or paper away from you computer then it won't matter about what happens to your computer.
2. Keep your keys (or seed) safe from other people and hackers. Encryption is the best way for this - either encrypted wallet, encrypted flash stick or both, or encrypted paper wallets. 
Most of the headaches and painful loss of money are related to not taking these two things seriously.
When you have your keys (in your bitcoin wallet) or seed you can recover your funds at any time even if the wallet on your computer is wiped out. This is because with Bitcoin all the transactions are store in a global distributed ledger spread across thousands of computers worldwide and not just in your own computer. As long as the transactions remain in that ledger you will only need the keys in order to access them.
Keys can take several forms but are really just a large random number. They can be stored encrypted in a wallet file, or printed on paper, or visually as a QR code, or even as a sequence of words. The key is what you use to sign a transaction and without the key you cannot prove you own the funds at the associated address. You can generate the address from the key, but not the key from the address. So keep your keys safe and you will not have trouble with lost funds.
People can send you bitcoins as long as they know your address. This is because a transaction requires only your address and their key (to sign the transaction). A miner will check those bits of info and validate the transaction using math, and store it in the global ledger (the blockchain). 
When you open your wallet software, if it's net connected, then it will scan the ledger and update your local copy of transactions. It can do this with just your addresses and for safety you can keep the keys offline or on paper.
When you want to spend funds you will need to access your keys so you can sign the transaction that send the bitcoins.

Electrum already supports several protocols and editable ports. Most servers provide HTTPS, SSL, HTTP services. Most of them use unusual ports like 8082 for HTTPS but I think a few offer port 443 so it can be used inconspiculously. It also supports SOCKS so you can use Tor and SSH tunnels easily. I've tried both of those without issues. An SSH tunnel is easy to use and not likely to draw much attention since most server admin work and sftp looks the same.

If you look at it and want to use it with Bitcoin I can post a patch file. It adds Bitcoin as a currency and makes it so it can handle the 8 decimal places. moneyGuru already has support for currencies so these changes are quite minor, mostly adding a symbol and decimal place handler. 
It updates most currencies but since Bitcoin is not a standard feed it doesn't update it's price automatically. I've just been adding sqlite records manually for that but I should make a plugin that updates prices bypassing the default update process.

A transaction with several small inputs and no fee is likely to be slow to confirm. It is made worse when the inputs are "fresh", ie. haven't been sitting for a long time. The algorithm for determining priority is based on trx size, age of inputs, input values and fee paid.
With no fee paid (and small value recent inputs) you are basically waiting for a miner that includes low priority transactions to find a block. That is probability based and with bad luck can take a very long time.

I created a wallet using coin flips. I used 2 coins so I didn't have to flip so many times. 
You could use 4 at once it would be like using a Hexidice, though I'm not sure if multi-coin flips are as random as single coin flips.
For those non-programmers out here's how:
Flip your coins and write down what you get as a series of 1 or 0, eg. heads = 1, tails = 0. Group them in 4 bits each. Convert them to hex (in your head is easy), and write the hex value below each group of 4 bits. You can use any 4 bit conversion table you like but the "normal" one is below just for reference. You need 32 of these Hex digits (128 bits total).
Now on your "secure" offline computer install Electrum to create a wallet. Either from the cmd line or the gui select "restore". Enter the 32 Hex digits as your seed. It will generate the wallet. That's it - you now have a wallet created from your random coin flips. Of course, this will work with any 32 random hex values you generate, even from radioactive decay.
Apparently the latest Ubuntu is going to have Electrum in it's repository so you can install it from verified packages. 
    0000 = 0
    0001 = 1
    0010 = 2
    0011 = 3
    0100 = 4
    0101 = 5
    0110 = 6
    0111 = 7
    1000 = 8
    1001 = 9
    1010 = A
    1011 = B
    1100 = C
    1101 = D
    1110 = E
    1111 = F

You do want both. The seed allows restoring the wallet if lost or corrupted. The password is what you use when spending btc.

Electrum seed. Type in the 12 word seed and get access to your entire wallet with unlimited keys, anywhere. Note the seed is not a "brainwallet", it is an encoding of a random 128 bit value and so just as strong.
You can also take the same approach but without Electrum if you want to be able to access any number of keys anywhere. Create a random seed and use that and a suffix "key sequence number"  with sha256 to generate the keys. Now the seed generates any number of keys. But it's not as convenient as Electrum for spending.

I've read the Ubuntu 13.10 repository has Electrum. I haven't used that but it's probably fine  - except they tend to have out of date versions in the repo so I don't know which one they have. It should work even if not with all the latest features.
Electrum is python based so it requires python and a few other packages to be installed. I don't think there is a canned uninstall procedure except "apt-get remove" (only if you used apt-get to install). But I believe you can install a new version on top of the old and it should work. 
The way I've always used it (since I'm a coder) is by using git. So I use,

The 7 words remaining have 1626^7 permutations = 3 x 10^22.
Each of the 5 known words could be in any of 12 positions, but the remaining cannot be in the same position.
12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 = 95040
For each of those known combinations we can still have the full set of remaining 7 unknowns, hence, total possible permutations,
95040 * 3 x 10^22 = 2.85 x 10^27
Original 12 word permutations was 1626^12 = 3.41 x 10^38
So knowing 5 words is 3.41 x 10^38 / 2.85 x 10^27 = 119,839,954,395 times easier.

If you know math and programming then start reading the bitcoin source code on github. main.cpp isn't that long and contains most of the stuff for mining that will make it clear what it does. You can gloss over a lot and focus on the code that checks transactions and creates a block when mining.

I don' think it would make sense for them to go the PPCoin route. They would have to spend a lot to promote it and stand to look silly if it's not well accepted. It probably wouldn't be as anyone versed in Bitcoin would reject it as centralized, and anyone not well versed may have negative associations due to Bitcoin, and that Amazon got there first.
By looking at Bitcoin they would be smart to see where they simply pick up value off the table from the already exiting network effect, and as every other company promotes Bitcoin they gain as well. One of the areas they have goodwill is TRUST. If they offer exchange and online wallet services they can almost instantly be the leader in that for USA since the US playing field at the moment is dismal. But they also can grow worldwide (Africa) without having nearly as much overhead and regulatory cost as normal CC/Bank based expansion. Not acting right now is to cede the marketplace to other startups like Circle, Square (maybe) etc. Today, right now they are choosing if next year they'll be a Kodak or a Canon.

CoinJoin is a method for mixing coins in a transaction. The idea is that several users wanting to send funds co-ordinate their intentions by collating the inputs to their transactions so that a "master transaction" can be built. Once that's done then they verify it contains what they need in terms of outputs and change and sign the transaction. Only when all the users have signed it then it can be relayed to the network for inclusion in a block.
The principle is that when you have lots of inputs from multiple addresses and lots of outputs to multiple addresses you can no longer determine what went where and from whom. This enhances privacy for everybody - even those not using the mixing. This is because it's no longer high likely that all inputs to a transaction come from a single wallet, and hence you can no longer make that association to link addresses to a single person.

Thank You for the tip.
I'm sure you're right about the d16. I've noticed that's it's less common, and not being a player myself I only guessed it was unusual for normal play. A d20 works fine as long as you discard 17-20 instead of trying to use it in some way, though technically you can save those rolls as additional 2 bit pairs, and combine 2 x 2bit to make an extra hex digit.
Regarding long seeds I think there is some support there but I have not explored it. I recall looking thru the code and seeing something related to that. I opened an issue on github before related to entering an incorrect number of hex digits because it doesn't work correctly in some cases. eg. 31 digits will cause it to create a watch-only wallet apparently always with a fixed set of addresses that does have a balance. When I first tried that I didn't initially notice it was watch-only and my jaw dropped as I thought I'd hit someone else's seed.

This is fractional reserve banking not fiat currency. And if they cannot lend out more than they have on account then it's not even fractional reserve. What you've posted makes no sense as unlike the current central banking system there is no way to create the funds needed to loan out more than on account. Sure, a bank can accept bitcoin deposits and lend them out but they cannot create new bitcoins to lend out more than they received - hence, there is no fraction of bitcoins in reserve. That is, they never lend more than they owe.
It is still true that the bank may end up not able to repay the deposits made. But this has nothing to do with fractional reserve and does not cause any growth in the money supply. ie. inflation.
Bitcoin cannot become "fiat" unless some country chooses to enforce use of Bitcoin. Hard to imagine that happening as there would be no advantage for the rulers of that country.
TLDR; you're overreacting to something you've only imagined.

What amazes me is that these sellouts think they are going to increase the value of Bitcoin by turning it into a government managed economy. No, no - they say it's private and optional but this whole scheme cannot work or make any sense if it's not soon mandated by fincen rulings. What online store or service is going to Opt-In and expressly cut out a major customer base unless they are forced to. 
As I said elsewhere this is all about these guys positioning themselves to be the future "Certificate Registrars" of Bitcoin by developing the technology and infrastructure to add the bureaucracy on top of Bitcoin that would most please the US govt.

That's correct. The difficulty actually has nothing to do with proving a block is valid. The block is validated separately by hashes and signatures. But the difficulty of hashing to a specific constraint ensures that blocks are created statistically regular timewise and since each block contains a reward that controls the creation of new bitcoin.

There are various items you could look at but none would be accurate indicators, and even measuring these is difficult.

Only seconds to propagate across the network, 10 minutes on average to be confirmed and locked into the blockchain. You can accept it within seconds if the value is low but for larger amounts it's really much safer to wait on several confirmations to ensure it isn't fraudulent.

Well, the transactions flow to every node of the network but only miners build blocks that then also flow to every node. So maybe a big bundle of nodes with some being miners.

I don't think people are really seeing how this is a Trojan Horse against Bitcoin. Imagine in a couple years when most businesses use the Green List or it becomes required they use the Green List.
Using the Green List is a transfer of responsibility. It says "I validated my customers pmts, therefore I'm safe". This has the effect of pushing that validation upstream. Now customers will want to make sure they validate who they deal with as well otherwise they take on responsibility for handling/receiving bad coins. 
The result is that you have a network superimposed on top of Bitcoin consisting of validated users and anyone not in that validated network will not be able (socially) to spend their coins except with other non-validated users.
If the validation focuses on USA or a few countries then usage starts to split into First World transactions and Other World transactions.
Not being able to trust that you can spend your coins is a destruction of fungibility resulting in less utility for Bitcoin as a whole. Some bitcoiners will see this as a negative and want to exit Bitcoin.
The company (or companies? or govt agencies?) that are managing the ID validation database become the gate keepers Bitcoin intended to remove from our lives. That is the destruction of Bitcoin. Not only will you soon require validation to transact but you will be utterly dependent on the validator. You'll trust they don't remove you from the list, you'll pay them fees for validating you. You'll trust they don't abuse the entire map of your financial history they have access to.
I'm sorry if people cannot see this yet, but when they do realize the system is corrupted they will exit, leading to an exodus and price collapse.

When you send btc the transaction is included in a block on the blockchain. Each new block is a "confirmation", meaning that it is more likely that it will not be a double-spend and discarded. Blocks are created on average about every 10 minutes, and many systems treat 6 blocks as being very safe. ie. after roughly an hour the transaction can be treated as "non-reversable".
I don't what the MtGox policy is off-hand but they may not allow sending coins again until after they have confirmed fully. That could be an hour or sometimes longer. So just in case you sent money there and then realized it wasn't a good idea and tried to send out again shortly after - it may be worth trying again after a while.

This has happened before and there is not much you can do. The reason is that you cannot prove you own the address it was sent from (because you don't own it).

Electrum stores the seed encrypted in your wallet file. You need the password to allow it to decrypt and use the seed to generate new keys. However, neither the seed nor any private keys generated are sent anywhere by the client so no "Electrum server" ever sees them.
Since the Electrum code is python it would be fairly easy for some virus to splice in code that relays the seed during the brief time it is decrypted and used. I mean that could be done with binaries too but it's quite unsophisticated to do it with patching a python script.

An Electrum seed is the opposite of a brain wallet passphrase. In a brain wallet you choose the words and use SHA256 to generate a key.

I read the code last year thoroughly. At that time it was fine. I haven't checked recent versions. 
You can't really verify the code unless you know how the ECC functions should be used. I compared it to the code in vanitygen and was also familiar with Electrum internals. So I looked at the code that generates the key and the address and ensured it was similar to the other methods. I actually had a more involved reason as I was writing an online vanity address generator and so I worked through bitaddress code to learn how it worked. At that time it didn't yet have support for vanity addresses - that was added after.
If you really want to know who has gone through it (and I believe some of the core devs have reviewed it and were involved with the original library code) then best thing is to review the bitcointalk.org forum support thread. It is a pretty detailed history of it's development over the last few years, and is a very comprehensive look into how and what was done. (24 pages)
@_date: 2013-04-15 05:14:18
That's interesting. I'd perhaps extend it to support Electrum deterministic (MPK) address generation (assuming it doesn't now). I have code for this already so would just need to adapt it.

That's just silly. Millions of $$ are transacted every month now. That is people using it right now. Maybe it's tiny compared to $$ transactions but it is growing constantly. 
People cannot start using it until they know what it is and until very recently no one even knew it existed. Even today only people who are paying attention to financial news and technology news know the name Bitcoin, and very few of them have any idea how to use it. So there is a long road ahead of increasing cycles of: hearing about it, learning, understanding, using. At some point of critical mass companies will layer tools on top of it so it's not so "nerdy". 
I use it for some payments when it's possible and it's easier than using Paypal, which I also use often. More importantly I don't feel like I'm being tracked and censored when I use it. 
Speculation is important to Bitcoin as is daily real-usage. The only way for Bitcoin to have a large enough market cap to obtain stability is for the speculation phase to be far ahead of the real-usage phase. But this is the same as real $$. The forex and derivatives markets are the biggest in the world. Much larger than daily physical cash $$ transactions.

When I used to run an Electrum server (bitcoind backend) on Amazon it was using around 40 GB/month. It's probably more now. I'm not sure that a regular bitcoin-qt install uses as much but it may.
Running bitcoin-qt is good if you want to be a part of the network and support it but for most users the 24/7 load and initial start up time is too much. A better approach is to use a light client like Electrum. Installs quickly, starts up right away and only needs to be run when you want to check status or send money.

Mixing or tumbling is useless. It's not about tainted coins. It's about tainted addresses. If you do not register your address, you cannot spend your coins regardless of whether tainted, clean or dirty. The purpose of registering is to ensure they can come and investigate how you got your coins. It removes all privacy from Bitcoin and ensures a binary system of registered coins and underground coins. People will choose not to accept coins from an unregistered address for fear of being investigated. They don't even need to look at the coin taint. 
If this takes off then wallet clients will consult a master Green List for addresses to ensure you don't accept coins from a bad source. It completely destroys all bitcoin privacy and takes us down the road of a central authority regulating all transactions via social fear of being responsible for accepting coins from an unregistered source.
The only way to fight it is to not ever register in the first place, and ensure that businesses who Opt In do not receive customers. Follow the implications and you'll see that accepting and registering is the first step in the collapse of Bitcoin (and it's market price of course).

This has the potential to allow consumers and content creators to connect and negotiate the market price for legal content without any third party distributor. 
I hope you can find a way to enable that so it works for both industry and pirates. I think there is some price where many/most users would choose legal over pirated, and even the big creators, if they have any brains, should be very happy to encourage a system that can pay them directly for this premium. It could cut out all sorts of distribution that usually cuts their bottom line, eg. TV adverts, video rentals all take a chunk out of what the user pays to view content, either in cash, convenience or irritation.

bitcoind works with the same wallet as bitcoin-qt. it's just the backend for the qt front end. You start it at cmd line with,
    bitcoind -daemon
and then can query values with cmds like, 
    bitcoind getinfo
    bitcoind getbalance
and shut it down with
    bitcoind stop
To access it via json api you need to configure a user/pwd in the bitcoin.conf file.

Don't rush - just take it slowly and get it worked out.
If you do code it yourself then look at Electrum on github as it has some server code samples. If you don't need to send refunds or payments then be sure to never keep your wallet on your server. Use the MPK (Master Public key) to create addresses. This way even if hacked you cannot have funds stolen from the server.

When you send bitcoins you create a transaction that is recorded in the global distributed ledger known as the blockchain. 
That doesn't depend on a specific wallet being connected to the network. But later on if the wallet client connects it will find the transaction in the ledger. It only needs to know the address. In fact, anyone can see that transaction.
Only the person (wallet) that has the key for that address will be able to spend it.

You only get a warning if it's issued by a CA not in the browser's acceptable list. That list is huge - hundred's of CAs as attack points, plus if you have access to a system you can manually add new CAs and then they won't give warning either. Hence, it was trivial for me to create my own CA and add it to the browser safe list. Any cert issued on my own CA then works fine without warning.
But my concern would be with the dozens of state issuing CAs in various countries like Turkey, Uruguay or wherever. Anyone able to trick/bribe one of them to provide a site's cert would have one acceptable to your browser.

You're not wrong. How they expect to deal with this is unclear. People use many addresses, or should use many, including change addresses. So the idea of a white list of valid addresses is immediately cumbersome. And also unsafe as re-using an address lowers the crypto security - though I'm not sure if it's enough to worry about.
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:45:34
Yes. 
A user with Electrum can generate an MPK that is used to create addresses. They give that to you and you can have the merchant cart for each user give out addresses specific to that user. The funds go to those addresses. You can monitor the address if you need to check the cart is paid but they are independent as far as public viewing.
When your user starts Electrum it syncs via a server and keeps generating addresses in the wallet, and checking for transactions, until it cannot find a transaction for some fixed number of addresses (default is 8 now I think, but it can be set via cmd option "gap limit"). They see and have access to spend those funds.

Actually it uses /dev/urandom on Linux or CryptGenRandom() on Win.
As follows,
wallet.py -&gt; ecdsa.util.randrange -&gt; os.urandom -&gt; /dev/urandom
The main difference is blocking or not blocking, so it should not matter for generating a single seed, not so often. But if you were automating generation of seeds continuously then you urandom would start producing less entropy.
I have no idea what CryptGenRandom() does on windows  but if it taps into the Intel HWRNG then there are claims out there about that being plausibly compromisable via either microcode or doping.

"If the reserve holdings are 20% of deposits, then the actual money supply has been multiplied by 5, effectively. "
Only if they can create more money to loan beyond what exists in their account. You cannot hold 20% in reserve and loan out all the money (plus more) at the same time. Either it's in reserve or it's loaned out. This is unlike the current system where they can hold the funds deposited **as reserves** and loan out on top of that up to whatever multiple is allowed.
The most that a bank can loan out without the ability to create money is 100% and that would be deadly for them as they could not handle any withdraws at all. If they loan out 80% of the funds and hold 20% in reserve then they have not created anything because the loans appear as assets, and the deposits as liabilities on their books. This is like saying you increase the money supply when you borrow $100 from your father. No, it does not because on his books your debt is an asset, and on yours it's a liability. The only way a bank can lend out more than it received is by the central banking mechanism which does not exist in Bitcoin. ie. There is no multiplier effect without the legal underpinnings of the central bank.
Again: in the Bitcoin system there is no way for a bank to create money to loan out unlike the fiat central banking system where this happens. What you describe above is the current central banking system and that is not possible with Bitcoin due to the mechanism for creating bitcoins. That was the whole point of Satoshi creating Bitcoin as it is.

That's a really interesting site. 
I'd say it let's you put some upper/lower bounds but even that's not true as an address could be owned by more than one person or group. eg.  the FBI, not owned by a person (anymore).
It seems to indicate 2,081,440 addresses have a balance, and 2,557,809 btc are owned by the top 100. That's 21% owned by 0.004% as an upper bound. 
1% of addresses would be 208,144 which seems to be just about anyone with more than 1 btc. So obviously 99% of addresses have very small amounts on them.
If you only counted the ones that have 1 btc or more, then 1% of addresses would be 19,806 addresses and the total of that would be people with something around 50btc or more (which doesn't seem to be immediately calculable). If you have a balance around ~50btc or more then you may be in the Top 1%.

I didn't read your whole post as you obviously don't understand what you're talking about. The money called reserves at banks is what they hold on reserve by depositing it with the Federal Reserve bank, not what they hold back from loans. It's the Fed Res system that requires they hold reserves in exchange for the privilege to "print" money for loans. A central bank does not guarantee any deposits. That is the job of the FDIC (in USA anyway).
I suggest you do more reading about these subjects. You could start with "The Mystery of Banking" by Murray Rothbard as he gives fairly simple explanations of the current system along with detailed balance sheets. It's also easy to find free online.

Click on the "Receive" tab in Electrum and then the "Change" item. If there is an address listed there with an amount then that means some of your balance is on that "change" address, ie. sent back to you as change from a payment. 
Your wallet will manage that automatically so if you need it will combine that change with your other addresses to make a payment.

These are two different classes. A address is more like a user, though obviously not one-to-one with users. Bank notes are like bitcoins, not addresses.
To try and track them the same as bitcoins you would have to attach lists of serial# to each transaction. ie. a transaction would be a list of serial# as inputs from a user, and an output user. You wouldn't need serial# as output since you can't have change because bank notes cannot be split. But you may have a list of serial# as fee paid out, which the output user doesn't get.
Much of the blockchain could be the same, but removing the generation step which would instead have to depend on fees paid. Serial# would have to be introduced via some escrow  mechanism that accepts actual bank notes and issues valid new serial# in a transaction. Perhaps a bank has the ability to destroy bank notes and issue a transaction based on the serial# destroyed...

This is true. The price had dropped from $31 to around $17 before the hack. The peak was very brief and probably due simply to imbalances in available market participants. eg. Buyers placed orders and not enough sellers were present to fill them. Once sellers responded the price dropped again. 
It took 6 months for the price to work it's way down to the $2-3 range and I think that portion could be attributed to concerns about hacks, security and general malaise about Bitcoin's future. During this whole downward slide there was still many Bitcoin believers who were happy to buy up coins because they felt strongly that it's time was not over. Essentially the feeling was that Bitcoin had gotten over bought by speculators in the spring and that slowly these weak holders were letting go and selling off to stronger hands.
Recent upward motion is due to a much stronger infrastructure that has grown around Bitcoin, from many well funded businesses, lack of recent hacks and renewed interest in what is slowly being recognized as a viable payment system. 
Volatility is directly related to lack of market depth. Whereas Forex markets are huge and transact many billions of dollars/day, Bitcoin is small and even modestly funded participants can cause large price moves. This will continue until such time as a million dollar trade has minimal effect and for that to happen the price would need to be much higher than now.

While miners create the blocks they still only have one vote, the same as all other nodes, in the building of the chain. Non-miner "regular" nodes also have one vote, ie. everyone using a full client on the network.
So it is not just miners who decide on protocol acceptance but all nodes on the network. If you run a node that doesn't accept some change then your version of the blockchain will reflect that as you will reject new blocks not following your rules. Not to say that you have much control over others but your node will only relay blocks it sees as valid, resulting in invalid blocks being dropped. ie. a miner cannot force other non-miners to accept it's blocks.

You can generate a private key using dice rolls offline yourself. Short of a lot a time consuming manual math you would still need to use software to extract the address from the key, but the code for that is quite simple to check and doesn't involve any RNG. If that is done offline there's very, very little chance of the key being leaked. There are simple utilities around that take a key and give you the address.

He could have generated them from an Electrum MPK (seed wallet), then he could sweep back any unclaimed values at any time later. I don't know if he did but that's the way to do this kind of thing.

| Each address is linked to an amount
To clarify on this point. The blockchain doesn't store balances. It contains transactions. So to know the balance of an address the software adds up any transaction outputs to an address that have not been used as inputs to subsequent transaction. This sum of unspent outputs is the calculated address balance.

It's much easier and safer to use **Electrum** with a "Master Public Key" (MPK) to generate an unlimited series of addresses as you need them.

For those who don't quite understand this - a dedicated Bitcoin OS is very dangerous because there are so many places in an OS to hide malicious code. The simplest is to subvert the random number generator such that numbers appear random but are in fact predictable.

Typically a QR code is presented on a phone/pad. 
Electrum is one very easy to use (and install) wallet that has a POS plugin allowing generating a new QR for each sale. The nice thing about this (other than being simple to get going), is that a Master Public Key (MPK) can be used on the in-store wallet, making it receive-only, and the seed can be safely on a back end system (at home or the office). So staff accepting payments can never spend funds.

But that's not what they're doing. What they are doing is far worse.
They are not tainting coins, they are tainting addresses. If you don't have a registered address then you won't be able to spend coins. At first this may seem minor as only a few businesses opt-in. But over time and when laws change, all businesses will only accept coins from registered addresses. This forces users to also only accept coins from registered addresses as otherwise they become liable under investigation for explaining how they got their coins, and whether they paid tax etc. It removes privacy from bitcoin and 100% subverts Bitcoin via central control of validating addresses. 
The effect will be that users who value Bitcoin privacy will dump their coins at the optimal point where price is highest before system closure, that point where using registered bitcoins becomes dominant, resulting in price collapse.

Did you ever roll a series to test if it's got a uniform distribution because many of the dice mfr actually produce dice that are non-uniform. I was just reading up on this today. I know the Hexidice is made by Gamestation but I don't think it's a Gamescience one (they own Gamescience). The Gamescience ones have sharper edges and roll more uniformly. Due to this I thought maybe a better choice is the Gamescience d16 dice and using 10 as 0, and 11-16 as A-F.
If it's not uniform then someone could roll Hexidice, find where it's biased and simulate that with a RNG to stand a better chance of guessing your key. 
Here is a link to a simple method to check bias that requires a minimum of 80 rolls for a d16. 
I'd be very interested if you do check yours as I was going to buy some.
This guy below checked common 6 sided dice and found that rolling 1 is almost twice as likely as others due to weight differences from pips (dots).
Only casino dice were accurate and that was due to having sharp edges. Hence, why I think the Gamescience d16 may be better.

Unfortunately you can't use that figure for actual transaction volume because any portion of it could be change values.

You can create a private key by rolling dice and making a large random number by hand. But  you don't want to generate the address for that key by hand. That would take a very long time, no doubt, to calculate the public key and then hash it twice, and then convert number bases to arrive at an address. Unfortunately you need the address to send funds so a private key alone isn't useful.
It is possible to do a transaction but not entirely to stay free of computers.
Print out a paper wallet using something like bitaddress.org.
You then fund the address with some amount.
Now, without computer, you can meet up with someone and give them the paper wallet. They need to trust you, or else have a computer available to verify and sweep funds to a new address.

Each use of your address provides another data point with public key and signature that can reduce the difficulty of finding your private key.

You could use the blockchain.info shared-send to request a mixer address for each sale, and have the amount go to a new address you generate with an (Electrum) MPK. This would mix each payment before arrival into your wallet. They take 0.5%, which isn't too too bad. It seems to generally be reliable although a bit slow in some reports (maybe depending on amount).
I'm talking about the shard-send forwarding API here which doesn't seem to be an explicitly documented API but is used on the wallet support page below. There is an ajax js function which makes the request.
You give it your destination address and it gives back a mixer address. Payment sent there gets relayed via mixing to your given address.

I've coded for Rockbox before. It's an ARM platform and should be able to do what's needed for a hardware wallet. I actually thought of this idea a while back but didn't pursue it because the dial interface isn't that handy for dealing with money and addresses. 
It could be used to generate a wallet and store it in program flash memory. You could plug it into a PC and use the dial to choose a unsigned transaction file, sign it and write out again showing the details for verification on screen. Making it work with Electrum for that would be feasible.
I was kind of leaning towards some super simple Linux smart phone OS instead. A dedicated ElectrumOS for smart phone that has everything in flash ROM including the encrypted seed would allow using wifi for updates and transactions without fear of virus/trojans/key loggers. If simple enough it should be workable for a wider range of cheap second hand phones allowing any old phone to be turned into a dedicated hardware wallet.

Bitcoin allows these WU agents (offices) to offer the same service without Western Union at all. ie. they get their commission and the customers doesn't pay for WU to operate the network.  I'm not sure how much WU skims off for operating the network but I'd guess it's at least half (plus exchange rate spread they screw you on as well).
WU can't really integrate Bitcoin because they already have the network and gain little from Bitcoin. But WU agents could cast off their network and offer Bitcoin as an alternative that would probably displace WU. Problem is most likely exclusivity contracts - you never see the same agent offering both WU and MoneyGram.

The current disk space is around 12GB. Typical low-end VPS accounts come with a fair bit more than that. So it would depend on how much space you need for other uses but often light duty web sites don't use much at all.
Traffic can be quite a bit but even most low end VPS accounts come with plenty. When I ran one it was on Amazon EC2 and I recall it being around 40-50 GB/mo. Later I moved it to a VPS and the whole thing cost me $7/mo. but when I didn't need to host a couple web sites I cancelled the server. 
I often think about running one again but there are about a dozen available now and that seems to be enough. I haven't heard if they are heavily loaded now but I kind of doubt it.
Anybody running a bitcoind node could run Electrum server on top of it (for their own private use if they chose) and it doesn't use that much more resources. Mostly just more RAM. I'm not sure but I think it still requires a custom compile of bitcoind with a patch.

The problem with these "silly manipulations" is that they don't really add much entropy. Not as much as you'd think.
Let's say you choose some phrase and then think of a "silly way" to mangle it. What you've essentially done is double the permutations, or added only 1 bit of entropy. Cracker must check passphrase P, and SillyWay(P).
You might say there is an infinite number of SillyWay() functions and there is, but the cracker can build a list of these SillyWay() methods and try them in sequence. Most users will only apply 1 or 2 SIllyWay() functions to their passphrase because otherwise it gets too hard to remember. So if each SillyWay() doubles the search space then that means 1 bit of entropy.
So if you start with a fairly poor pass phrase of , say 20 bits entropy and apply 2 SillyWay() functions then you actually haven't made it much harder - only 22 bits entropy. A decent random passphrase needs at least 60-80 bits entropy and you end up being the low hanging fruit. You really want about 128 bits entropy - meaning on that poor passphrase P you're going to need about 108 SillyWay() functions applied to equal a truly random one.

In the console tab try,
    wallet.storage.put( 'gap_limit', 10)
or some suitable number to cover how many you have used. Reload wallet.
This gap limit value determines how many addresses are created and monitored ahead of the last known used one. In an offline wallet it doesn't know which is used because it has no blockchain access so it never moves beyond 5 (default) on it's own (unlike an online wallet). Saving the value to file means on next opening it will see there is not enough addresses and generate more.
I hope they can make this a little smoother in upcoming versions. IMO it should keep generating addresses when signing a transaction until all needed are available, or maybe  prompt at some reasonable limit.

I don't think this will help. Mixing won't help. If they add a Green-Black List converter maybe it will help. By that I mean a function that looks up any address on the Green List and Black Lists it instead.
People don't seem to be getting that this CoinValidation is not Coin Validation it is Address validation. ie. you can have good or bad coins but if you try to transact from an unregistered address, ie unverified ID, then you cannot spend. The naming is classic misdirection - as if they have been consulting Burson Marsteller or some such propaganda specialist.
This needs to be nipped in the bud or it will destroy Bitcoin privacy, regardless of mixing, and before long instigate the collapse of Bitcoin. Price collapse and functional network collapse.

$100 is arbitrary. How do you decide what price is right? I'm not aware of an accurate equation and pulling numbers out of the air based on what it was last week isn't going to work either. There are six billion people on the planet and slowly they're hearing about Bitcoin.

The only way to decide when it will stop is by closely watching demand and right now demand is still high.

Every time the price moves up or down isn't a rally or crash. It's just an imbalance between buyers and sellers. 
Think about it - they don't always come to market at the same time with the same idea of trading "in balance". There will be moves according to more of one or the other. Some guys place orders to buy and it moves up, and later some come into to sell and it moves down. If they happen to place orders at the same time it doesn't move much at all.

I don't know why people mix these up as it makes no sense to talk of price increases as inflation. Inflation implies expansion, and the mental image of prices expanding doesn't quite hold.

This is pretty confusing. I thought the idea of running a node was to increase network security. Having a non-listening node still increases overall security but does not provide a node that can accept new connections. Some time ago the devs were asking people to help network security by running a node. But now it seems they don't want extra nodes unless they are also listening for new connections. I don't need to run bitcoind but I do anyway as I thought it was helping the network. But I will not open a port for it as on my network. I'm not willing to trust bitcoind cannot be compromised and allow some hacker to gain access to my network. So I guess it's just better for me to turn it off. I don't need it for my wallet.
AFAIK a node not listening is still doing everything except not accepting connections from new nodes. So if my node connects to another then that node can get data from me. But I take it there is some problem now with not enough listening nodes for new connections?

If you trade bitcoins on an exchange then they are the MSB, not you. You are responsible to report any capital gains as taxable income. You will need to provide ID verification to them so they can meet the MSB requirements.
If you trade bitcoins directly with people as a business (for gain) then you are required to register as a MSB, and probably for state licenses as well. And you are also responsible for any net profit as taxable income, just like any business.

So far doesn't seem to be any indication of Bitcoin failure. Encryption won't help if you write your pass phrase down somewhere amongst your possessions. You can bet the FBI has been going over every item they found with a fine toothed comb, and probably have a team who worked specifically on locating this. My guess is that any decent "cracker" with physical access to his possessions wouldn't take as long as the FBI did to locate and crack his wallet(s). Even if they didn't actually find a written pass phrase the ability to sift through all his stuff and build word lists used to brute force the wallet is one attack method. Most likely he had a strong random password that was stored in some password safe tool accessible with a much easier to remember password. Or he has some paper wallets tucked away that it took them a while to find. 
All sorts of scenarios are possible and I hope some day we'll find out how it was "cracked". My guess is he didn't think he'd be found and so didn't plan for that, leaving either clues or actual data laying around. Or just didn't use a very strong password. Most people don't. And he has proven to be less than careful in his online activities.

When the price of bitcoin is much higher the amount bitcoin for trades of some value will be that much less. eg. when BTC = $100 to move $1million requires dumping 10,000 BTC. But when BTC is $5000 each that same USD value can be traded with only 200 BTC. Hence, for a given USD volume the trades all get smaller and have less effect with a much larger pool of money sitting on the exchanges.

The sha256 hash is used on transaction data. It has to be done in a very specific way but essentially the data making up new transactions is wrapped up with the hash from previous blocks and a nonce value to form a new input to be hashed. The nonce value is incremented creating new hashes of the data until a special condition is met. The condition is a leading number of zeros in the hash output. More zeros is more difficult and less zeros less difficult. A miner cycles thru nonce values until a hash has the required leading zeros and submits the resulting block to the network. If accepted, miners start working on a new block.
New bitcoins are created because a miner is allowed to add a special coinbase transaction to the block that is hashed. That special transaction can send a specific number of bitcoins that came from nowhere to a given address.
This is a very simplified description. I left out many of the details of building up the data to be hashed. And that it's a double hash process.
If you want to know about specifics of the sha256 algorithm just check wikipedia.

There isn't really any encryption involved unless you're talking about some externally agreed upon encryption method. With Bitcoin you can sign messages with the key for your address but that isn't encryption. You send a message and a signature that the recipient can verify with your address. This could be automated but to my knowledge no clients currently do that. There has been discussion of protocols for doing this for handling invoices etc. and I believe in the future there will be standards but it will be a function of e-commerce software rather than something which obsoletes such software.

To clarify: It's not really the higher you pay the faster it gets included. 
For any trx (value,byte-size,input_age) there is a fee amount that will have near 100% probability of being included in the next block. Above that fee amount you gain nothing in speed. Below it you reduce the probability of inclusion as some miners may not be including your trx.

A private key is simply a 256 bit random number (with a small segment of excluded values which are very unlikely to be hit). 
You can roll dice or flip coins to create a private key. 
There are also several other ways that allow using a "scheme" so they are easier to manage, eg. seeds are a base number allowing regenerating a "chain" using calculations. The simplest (poor) example of a seed is just a private key that you keep adding 1 to to get the next key.
Once you have a private key you need to use some fancy ECC math and hash functions to extract the "address" from the key. But the key itself requires no further calculation, although usually people write it in a special format (base58) requiring conversion math.

I usually get about 3-4% below MtGox price but given there are fees at MtGox as well it's actually a bit less difference. Also given that the price is volatile it's probably a bigger difference what hour you sell at, ie. if you wait for a little bump up you can offset the higher fee.

You don't really gain an advantage by having a bigger rig. You gain advantage by being more efficient. ASICs are much more efficient and so they will become the norm. Having a bigger rig just scales up the volume. Whereas you may make $5/mo. with a small rig, having a bigger rig could make that $500/mo. But either way if you're not efficient you lose money by mining. The rate of return is close to linear, except for overhead costs.

Not directly except that the conditions for it not being included may still exist on additional blocks. The conditions may change due to how many trxs are in the following blocks. Some miners may alter their acceptance based on total trx count/size.

If you add up the months it would be close to 30x0.0003 + 30x0.00015 ... etc, or total 30x0.0006 by year end.

They are created by miners.
A miner listens on the network for transactions. Takes transactions and combines them into a block along with some fancy crypto math and when it finds the "magic" number to complete the block's crypto math, it broadcasts it to the network.
Other nodes then verify the block and decide whether to accept or discard it. Valid blocks get added to each node's chain and the process repeats.
The first transaction in each new block is a reward of new coins created for the miner. Every 4 years that reward is cut in half (currently 25 btc). So this series of halving rewards is what causes the creation rate to drop and the total to approach a fixed limit of 21 million.
ie. block rewards 50 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 3.125 ...

It would if they moved their coins. The blockchain does not differentiate intent, uses or users. It probably doesn't happen so often because most people with a high bitcoin worth probably don't keep them all on one address. It's smarter to keep them on many addresses. 
There's no way to determine intent here. It could simply be someone with lots of coins deciding he'd be better off spreading them over many addresses with lower balances each. Or who knows. It could be MtGox moving coins to cold storage because of a sudden high number now being held on the exchange (due to the selloff).

Private keys can be used as many times as you like but they always control the same address. The problem with re-using them when using offline/paper wallets is if you import the key into an online client then it is at that point potentially exposed. So it will still work fine as long as you delete the key online and it wasn't compromised/stolen while there.
A better but more advanced approach that some people use is to keep the private keys offline and never bring them onto a net-connected computer. Wallets like Electrum or Armory enable this type of approach. 
Briefly, with Electrum you generate a wallet on your offline system. Then you export the MPK (master public key) and copy that to your net-connected computer. On this computer you create another Electrum wallet using the restore mode and paste in the MPK as the seed. This gives you an online **watch only** wallet. The private key has never been net-connected and cannot be compromised but the wallet shows your balances and allows generating more addresses to receive funds only.
When you want to spend you use your watch-only wallet as usual but when you click the "Send" button it generates a transaction and saves it to disk. You take this transaction file to your offline system for **signing** (which I believe has to be done with a cmd line still). Once signed you take this transaction file back to the net-connected system for actually sending. The private key has never been exposed.

Electrum uses AES to encrypt the seed and any imported keys. So be aware that the wallet file is not entirely encrypted - only those parts. It uses the [slowaes]( python library to handle encryption so how robust it is would depend on that. I haven't reviewed or audited that myself but believe it's probably decent. The seed is decrypted when a password is provided and the private keys generated as needed for a transaction.
[AES]( is in general considered strong. If you are paranoid about the NSA getting access then you may want to go further such as encrypting the drive with truecrypt or using linux with an encrypted home (which would automatically ensure the electrum data is encrypted further), or other robust methods.

I could see someone offering a time-lock escrow service. You voluntarily lock your funds in escrow with them and they only sign a maximum spend per day (like an ATM) escrow.
By someone, I mean a trusted entity, or even perhaps you run your own server daemon that monitors the blockchain. I think this could be done now with just a simple script. Hmm. Maybe I should write one.

This really is the realm of the software creating the transaction and if you are going to manually create a transaction you do need to understand how it works. In this case brainwallet.org should have some obvious safety features if it's going to offer a way to manually create transactions.

I can't see the point of that. Are you thinking they will offer Bitcoin xfer for less than WU xfer? Why? They won't be able to save the costs of having their own network. The agents will still expect the same commission. I expect they'll resist that right up until they have to go out of business. The only advantage would be enabling xfer outside their own network and that removes the "market capture" they spent the last century building.

You need the private key but in order to spend from it you need to create a transaction. There are ways to do that using software but most merchants won't be able/ready to do it for you without importing your key into some wallet. Once paid they will have to return change to some address you control. Usually software takes care of this by returning change to your own wallet but if you have just a key printed out then you don't have a wallet. So you should have an empty address/key printed out as well. Then it's possible to have change returned to that second address. Once you give someone your private key you can no longer trust any funds on that address.
tldr; Spending from a paper wallet involves importing the key into software again. So while it's great for long term storage it isn't that easy for spending in person.

No, but more and more people are hearing about it. More and more people want some to use/save/gamble, whatever reason. If everyone in even a tiny country suddenly wanted to buy and few wanted to sell then you'd have what you see now. And Bitcoin is global - not limited to any small or large country.
That's all. More demand due to news, little supply due to starry eyes. And maybe a little regret felt by sellers at $19 who thought the bubble was going to burst and they'd load back up when it dropped back to $15. 
Also, I think you have to remember that this market is very small. If even half the the people in the USA decided they needed to own $5 of bitcoin when they woke up this morning that would be $750 million pouring into a market worth only $400 million at the current price. Now extend that out to China, Russia, Venezuela, Argentina or anywhere people may be thinking the same.

Yes, when the exchange got hacked and someone sold off a shitload of btc at once, driving the price down, they froze the exchange and took a few days to analyze and revert all the fraudulent trades.

I don't think you can delete the address without deleting the private key. Deleting the private key destroys any way of using money sitting on that address - so very unlikely you want to do that.
In Bitcoin the wallet is a set of keys. Each key has an address. Money is "unspent outputs" at a given address - so you can only spend money by issuing a transaction using some unspent outputs as input to the new transaction. You use the key to do this - so you absolutely need the keys to an address if there is money sitting on it still.
There is no advantage at all to deleting an address or key so I suggest you avoid the confusion and never delete anything. Backup up everything to a secure location, especially if you are dealing with significant amounts of money.

I'll have a look into that. I was thinking about how I might make it more useful but without it being cluttered (3D?) and difficult to understand. Coin age is hidden for the average user, and I'd have to research how it's calculated to get it right, so I didn't use it initially.
Also, transaction size (KB) matters but we start getting too many variables to keep it simple.
@_date: 2013-11-04 05:42:12
You would consider the word "space" available or likely and the permutations within that. So if you chose 20 words out of a space of 100 then it would be poor. By "space" I mean the set of all possible words. You may think it's millions but in fact most people only choose words out a fairly limited space. Fortunately even a smallish word space is enough if the selection is random. But non-random words out of a large space is quite poor.
eg. 20 words out of a space of 100,
100^20 = 1×10⁴⁰ permutations.
This is about 132 bits entropy, or very good.
( calculate entropy, log(N)/log(2), where N is permutations )
12 words out of a space of 1656 (Electrum seed)
1656^12 = 4.253280151×10³⁸
ie. more words out a smaller set is comparable to less words out of a larger set. The word length doesn't matter in either case because the token you vary is words not characters.

There are ASIC miners out there now. Check in the Hardware, [Custom Hardware]( section of bitcointalk.org for ongoing discussion. BTCGuild went up about 5000 GH/s a couple weeks back as some came online, but they also are spread over a few pools. I'm not sure that BFL will ever pan out but others are starting to finally hit the streets. Unlike the GPU transition this one has a much higher development barrier making it much harder than just writing some software. I can't say much more. I've been mining for almost 2 years but haven't followed closely the recent ASIC events. I just know when they finally hit "en masse", I'll be powering down.
BTW for your paper you should not take anyone's word as gospel here. Use it as a basis to do your own research. Just about the entire history of bitcoin is reflected in the archives of bitcointalk.org. Much more so than, say, newpaper articles, which often are full of errors. Not that bitcointalk isn't full of errors and rubbish too. But the genuine experts are there amongst the crazies and trolls.

I didn't see that but it's good they are trying to remove the change from the total. I wonder what the algorithm is? Deducting the largest output would guarantee that it is not over estimated, ie. volume is at least $X. I would guess on small value transactions the larger output would be real xfer but on large value transactions the largest output would be change. Not always of course.

But MtGox does determine the price due to it's volume. The best any other exchange can do is limited by their arbitrage volume. It would be nice to have a more balance exchange market and I think when some more big players enter the exchange market that will happen.

Well, here's something. Right now someone(s) has been buying on MtGox to sell in China. So even if pretty big sell orders come in on MtGox they're likely to be absorbed as long as China has buying pressure. We've seen that a few times already with brief drops and immediate buy ups.
I also think a lot of money went into ETFs and they don't really have the option of pulling out quickly. They're probably still easing their way in.
I think a lot of people learned from the first two crashes that they shouldn't be so panicky and will buy on the correction, making it hard to correct. So more resilient but when demand actually does falter then a nasty drop maybe.

That is one aspect of it's price evaluation but also consider that if people believe it will maintain a price or rise then it's price is also based on it's wealth storage ability, not just transfer. Similar to buying gold or paintings for $155 million one may be willing to risk some variation in order to keep some money outside the banking system. It would take a relatively few people with a fairly small amount of money each to maintain a significantly high price just on this alone, without even considering transfer volume. This is a fairly decent risk if you think that we are still early in the game. People who bought gold at $200-300 oz. were also looked at as odd when most people thought it couldn't possibly be worth &gt; $1000 oz. And those who held it from $32 oz can be viewed as "very early adopters" too.
I think price evaluation is for Bitcoin is complex and people who see it as simply a bubble will be sitting on the sidelines until too late. I have no idea when that will be but the market will certainly decide.

Using a single address is like publishing your bank statement online. 
Anyone can see all your transactions, and anyone who transacts with you knows who you are, how much you spend, or have as balance. They may know other addresses and deduce who you transacted with. It leaks a lot of info, destroying your privacy. If you only ever do a couple transactions that's probably not a big deal but as Bitcoin becomes more popular and you do more buying/selling with it, the accumulated info will damage your privacy and make you a target if you have a large balance.

The only way even remotely plausible for this is having buyers provide the BIP38 encrypted key for printing.

It's more than a nice thought. It's been proven true in Bitcoin historically. In Jan. 2012 when Bitcoin hit $2 there was plenty of miners still going because they believed in keeping the network secure and because they believed the price would rise again in the future, and they were willing to hold the coins. Those same guys are the ones who have thousands of btc now. I kept going but sold when the price hit $10 as I wasn't sure if it would go higher. At $2 it was a loss but at $10 it was a good profit. I was making &gt; 1 btc / day back then but the electricity was about $2.50/day - so it wasn't even break even.

It was pretty standard when GPUs were common as they produced so much heat. You basically just tried to duct the heat to where you wanted it. As ASICs get pushed more to the limit of profitability they also generate as much heat. After all, miners are all very efficient converters of electric energy to heat energy.

I see you got tips. I'll comment on your other questions. SGD I'm guessing is Singapore Dollars. You might try localbitcoins.com to locate if anyone is near you that trades bitcoins. I'm up in Bangkok and there are a few here.
You can create a paper wallet very simply with bitaddress.org. You print out the paper wallet and it is separate from your BitcoinQt or blockchain.info wallets. You can import the address or key into your other wallets. If you import the address then it will be view only (view balance, receive coins) in the wallet but if you import the key then it is fully functional - can send as well. 
Generally, paper wallets are kept separate from online wallets for security reasons and for holding larger balances. Printed copies are stored in safety deposit boxes or other physically safe locations. The critical thing is that you have wallet backups and/or paper backups and that you realize that anyone who gets your private key(s) can spend the coins attached to it's address.

If people don't want to buy things with their bitcoins yet then that means the price hasn't risen enough. 
When the price has reached the right ball park and stabilises then we'll see the speculation fade slowly diminish and users will be comfortable moving in and out as needed.

It's derived from the Electrum client and uses the same ECC steps. keyfmt only converts data and relies on input data for randomness. So if your rng is weak then it would cause weak keys.

1. The transaction is signed in the browser (JS code) not on the server. So there is never any reason for the server to know your keys. The server only stores encrypted keys and cannot ever decrypt them.

Yes. But addresses only potentially exist. The blockchain only records actual transactions. So until some bitcoin is actually sent to an address that address will not be recorded in the blockchain and therefore has no unspent balance. The act of sending a transaction creates the record of the address existing.

It would be very hard unless you leak information in some way. In practice it's hard to be perfect in these things. You are more likely to get linked in some way like here on reddit or your email. But as far as running bitcoin over an ssh tunnel it would depend on how sloppy you are with talking about it, or using a server that is compromised or even run as a honey pot. If you look at how Silk Rd was brought down it wasn't through Bitcoin but by investigating forum IDs and sloppy info leakage. The encryption used in ssh is very strong and makes traffic look like random data.

You've got it right. Feasible, yes. Profitable, not likely. Safe, No way.
Miners aren't making much now. Only the very cutting edge of ASICs are profitable and any mining contract is obviously going to make less than running miners yourself. The biggest problem is **trust**. You give someone a bundle of coins up front and they promise they'll pay you back over time. Probably not going to happen. Even if they do payout it's a diminishing prospect.

My pet theory: a massive outflow of btc to sell in China while the price was higher over there. That caused them to put the breaks on for 2 reasons. 1. in case there was some hack/problem and they were being hit, to verify and 2. they need to move coins from offline to hot wallet to handle the volume.

You can use a HexiDice (available on Amazon) to roll your own. It's a hexadecimal die - meaning it lands on values from 0-9A-F. Roll it 64 times and you have your own new private key.
I have a small program that can give you your address from a private key. It's in my github [misc repo]( and is called keyfmt. It will also work with the random number gen on your computer if you don't want to roll dice.
od -An -N32 -xw32 /dev/random | keyfmt "%a:%w"
outputs a totally new address and key. This is the simplest program I know for this and fits on one page so is easy to audit.

You can print out and store the wallet offline but that does not lower your risk online. The wallet is accessible in both places. Hence, a hacker that gains access or install a key logger on your computer can still compromise your wallet even if it's also printed offline.
An offline wallet is one which was created and only exists offline. So you use a fresh OS install to create a wallet and print it. It never touches a computer that is net connected.
Then you simply send the funds you want offline to that new wallet address. Now those funds are stored offline without any chance that they can be hacked. (Other than physical theft of the paper obviously so you need to keep it safe.)

A miner cannot create a block without first hashing and verifying it. Yes, the ASICs (or GPU or CPU) only do the nonce but that is the criteria needed as proof or work. The fact that everyone else has to verify their copy does not mean that the miner can produce bad blocks and it cannot hash just any old thing it likes. Only the miner completes the proof of work which is needed to ensure that the network is secure. Do other clients create blocks? No. So the ledger by definition cannot be updated without the miner hashing the block and completing the work. The current division of labour between pool and miner producing nonces, or solo miner doing it in the same process, is immaterial. My point above was that creating a block of transactions (updating the ledger) is not something you separate out from mining.

I'd buy something like that. I use electrum anyway. A close second choice that may be easier (or not) to build would be a stripped down linux (or android) os with nothing except cam and electrum offline core. No wifi, no phone enabled, no gps. Everything non-functional except screen and cam for showing capturing qr codes. It could be built for some older cheap model smart phones. This would be a software only approach where users source their own phone, flash it and use it as a smart-wallet. 
I don't know enough about smart phone development to do that but if there was a linux build already available to work from I could probably figure it out. I thought about starting from ubuntu phone and stripping out stuff but it seems that is designed to work on only a couple very new models.

Something else to consider. Most of the very wealthy now have their net worth tied up in some form of equity that depends on it being held. eg. Bill Gates has 50% (or whatever) of MS stock. Like Satoshi if he chose to suddenly sell it off you would see similar drops in price due to the supply/demand/confidence being out of whack. He wouldn't, right? And neither do all the other super rich with stock equity. And neither would Satoshi or the Winklevii have that inclination.

The price would go down but a few hundred btc is very little in the market now. To give you some comparison I recall a sell of 2500btc go through a few days ago and it caused about a 5 minute drop around $10-20 or so. It gets absorbed quickly as long as buyers are around ready to trade. If you sell it on an exchange with poor depth (not many btc being traded) then it will have a larger effect. But today trades of that size happen often and one more would not be noticed.

1. You have to generate the key not the address. You can generate a specific key if you like - it's just a random number (with a few exceptions), but be aware if someone else got the idea to use that specific number (eg. 31415926...etc) then they could take your coins.
2. Cutting international links would probably cause several independent blockchains to form where each one has miners and transactions within that network. That still wouldn't allow others access to your coins but I suspect it wouldn't be easy to merge again after. Presumably when they all started talking together one chain would win out - the longest one, ie. the one with the highest hash rate. Don't quote me on that - I'm guessing but probably some of the dev team has worked this out. If you were able to send transactions on more than one network then you may be able to double spend.

Even after you get running you may not be happy with how much bandwidth a node uses during normal operation. If you have 6GB/mo. limit then it could use all/most of that. I don't recall the figure now but when I first ran a node on Amazon EC2 I was surprised by the monthly total bandwidth used just operating as a node on the network.
You may want to use Electrum instead on a bandwidth constrained connection. I've been using it for 6 months and have been very happy with speed and functionality. It can import keys but you'll likely have to manually do that. A better option may be to transfer the balance to the deterministic wallet Electrum uses. Only one seed to backup for all your addresses.

That's one possible path but the result is not that different. In this scenario most businesses don't accept the alt-coin and won't be able to if there are mandatory rules about green listed addresses.
I should note that the more this future looks likely the more likely a "bank run" causes Bitcoin to collapse as people realize they must convert their coins before any such bureaucratic framework is effective. So if people are holding unregistered coins there becomes a date/time beyond which it's unlikely they can use them, so they must be dumped.

Confirmation time is not the same as send time. You can't tell how quickly it was confirmed from this time alone. You need to compare it to when it was sent. If they store when it was first seen on the network then you can compare that to it's confirmation time (which is the time of it's block inclusion) and it's fairly easy to make a chart of probable outcomes for any fee value.

There are several options here and it can be confusing depending on what you choose. The main thing is that to spend from your key you need to import it into something that can create a transaction - usually a wallet of some sort.
If you choose to use blockchain.info as wallet then they have some (custom spend) options that allow sending to an address and having change sent back to the same address. So you send 50 btc to where you like and choose your current address as dest for change, 50btc as well. But once you import your key onto blockchain.info it is no longer quite as safe as it was when simply printed on paper. 
If you choose to run a client on your desktop like, BitcoinQt or Electrum, then you would import the key and send the 50 btc as you wish. But the 50 btc change amount would be sent to another address in your wallet (called a change address). So you would then need to do another send to your original address if you want to ensure it ends up entirely back on your single key. Again, importing your key into your desktop client makes it no longer quite as safe as when simply printed on paper.
My choice for these situations is not to print out a paper key at all but to use Electrum in a secure offline mode. For this you use an offline (not connected to net) computer, install Electrum (easy), and create a wallet. Write down or print the 12 seed words for this wallet. These can be used at any time to restore the wallet and an unlimited number of keys/addresses from that seed. Now export the MPK (Master Public Key) to file on usb stick and take it to your online (net connected) system. Shut down the offline system (which may be just a usb stick with LiveOS).
Install Electrum again to your online system and choose "restore wallet". Give it your MPK from above and it creates a totally live "Watch Only" wallet that you can use to watch your addresses but having no private keys or seed - so your funds cannot be stolen from this wallet, even if a virus or key logger infects your system. You now have a useful safe online wallet on your daily use system and a safe secure "mirror" wallet offline, plus for backup, a set of seed words you put away in a safety deposit box or wherever. Safe. 
The beauty now is that with Electrum you can create your spend online but sign it offline on your safe system without any worry about change mixups and such accidents. As long as you have the seed words you can restore any number of addresses generated by Electrum in your use of your wallet, including the change ones.
Doing a secure spend is quite easy, and your keys never get imported to a vulnerable online system. You use the online wallet to create the spend as normal. It writes this "unsigned transaction" to a file (or text for copy/paste) and you transfer it to the offline wallet (which may be via usb stick, or rebooting onto a non-connected OS). Boot, and open offline Electrum and load the "unsigned transaction" and click "Sign", provide password. It signs and writes it to file again, and you move this "signed transaction" back to the online system. Back online, you load the "signed transaction" and click "Send". It gets sent to the network. Any change is returned to your wallet. Your keys never see the online system, never get imported to a web site, and always stay safe on the offline system. It sounds a bit complicated but once you do it a couple times you realize it's easy and can be done in quickly.
For small balances it's not really worth the hassle but if you're storing a large amount then an offline wallet is best, and the Electrum offline method is one that helps prevent screw ups. You have the peace of mind knowing that as long as you have those 12 seed words safe somewhere you can always restore your wallet (all your addresses) when needed. (Only, be aware if you import other keys into Electrum they are not restorable from the seed)

It doesn't really matter since the spread between the buy and sell remain mostly consistent.
eg. sell for $30 higher on MtGox but have to buy back at $30 higher on MtGox.
Moving fiat between exchanges to benefit from selling high here and buying low over there is the primary reason why there is different prices. Chances are good that by the time you sell high, move via banks with fees, and buy somewhere else the price will have already corrected.

Bitcoin doesn't need to become the dominant currency for it to succeed. Even if it was used for 1% of world commerce it would be an excellent "End Game" in itself. The few coins you hold now could be spent bit by bit in the future as an increasing income stream.
It's pretty hard or impossible to put meaningful numbers on this. Lots of people have tried and usually it's a bit unsatisfying. It's not a stretch that if 1% of the worlds population were actively using bitcoin for some transactions then at least a thousand times more people would need to have some on hand than now.

Does the Virtex wallet have some form of auto-sweep function? I know MtGox had that at one time where you could send bitcoin to an address and it would be sold on the exchange and added to your USD balance automatically..
The fact that your amount is being combined with a bunch of other amounts indicates that either it's Virtex that is doing it or that the private key for your address has been imported into some other users wallet - in which case the other amounts combined are in their wallet. Typically with an online wallet you do not have access to the private key (excepting ones like blockchain.info where you have full ownership).
Using an exchange wallet for activities other than selling coins is not a good idea anyway. You are much better off creating a blockchain.info wallet where you actually own and control the private key and sending your earnings there. Then if you intend to sell them you would transfer them to Virtex only at that time.

This is a naive approach. Any wallet containing addresses takes time to check the addresses for each block. Even with a few million that would become very slow, and you need to store more than millions of trillions to have any chance of finding anything. Your wallet would probably spend days-weeks-months just checking for each 10 minute block. Not going to work. 
A good programmer can whip up far more efficient ways to generate and check addresses. One approach is to scan the blockchain for unspent outputs and build a memory tree of the addresses for balances exceeding some minimum. Then you can generate keys at maximal rate and check them in memory (fast) against this tree.
For bonus points have a daemon that grabs new blocks and updates the memory tree so it's always current.

Yes. But the address is not technically the same as the public key. The address is derived from the public key via a hashing process. But right idea anyway. 
You can send money to an address that no one owns, doesn't exist in any wallet and it's still completely valid and recorded in the blockchain - but without a private key it can never be spent.

There is no limit but as more mining occurs the total hash rate of the network goes up and causes blocks to be solved faster. To account for this a feedback loop is implemented such that every 2016 blocks the difficulty of mining is adjusted (up or down) such the creation rate is constant (a block every 10 minutes). The effect of this is that more miners -&gt; higher difficulty -&gt; less chance of solving per miner -&gt; lower profit. Hence, the reward always tends to be guided towards the cost to mine plus some acceptable profit. When profit drops miners drop out, and when profit rises more people start mining. We've just now been through a huge expansion of mining due to increased BTC price. The introduction of ASIC miners at the start of 2013 led to a massive increase in difficulty this year, and now there is no point in mining if you aren't using this type of hardware.

Money laundering is the act of making ill gotten money seem like it came from legit enterprise. eg. stuff the till at a car wash so the govt thinks you got suddenly rich by washing cars instead of cooking meth.
Just sending money somewhere isn't laundering - it's called money transmission and the reason they are so anal about it is they want to know who sent what where. That way they can identify who ought to not have so much money and investigate where it came from. I mean believe it or not small and big companies transfer millions all the time but they have a business to legitimize where it comes from and goes and why.

The second output is change being sent back to an address in your wallet. 
The difference between total inputs and total outputs is the fee paid to the miner. 
In this case it included the second input because without it there was not enough to pay a fee (since the first input is exactly 0.01).
This all looks correct.

It wouldn't really have to be Amazon specific. It could just watch for supported product codes coming down the tube and use that to show results in their own tab.

Another thing that's changed over the past while - it's been getting easier to buy bitcoins. Coinbase came online and made it simpler for US residents, even though it still takes some time. I'd expect that they have are the primary buyer on MtGox to fill their backlog of orders.

To be competitive it would need to be 300/4500*274= $18. Though that's with vapourware so maybe with Avalon would be better. 
I've heard that Avalon has plans to sell the chips so people can make their own boards. I'm sure some open source boards would show up pretty quick. You can get a board that size made for about $1 online from China (just pcb no chips).

DCA is for when you don't know if it's going up or down right now, but in the long run you want some. So by "averaging" you give up the benefit of the dips and the sorrow of the peaks for somewhere between. If you truly believe in the long term then any price today is OK. People who bought between $5 and $10 aren't really too worried about exactly what price it was - they're just glad they bought some.

There are multiple servers run my independent volunteers. I run one and you could actually run your own if you eg. had a second computer or server available.
Regardless, you always have your electrum.dat file on your system which contains your wallet. Two things to do: backup up that wallet file and write down and safely store your seed word-list. Either one can be used to restore your wallet even with no server available.

No. Scan the blockchain for addresses with unspent outputs of eg. greater than 1000 btc. Put those addresses in a list in memory for high speed comparison and then focus your generation/hashing code on checking only those addresses.
If you can generate new keys at a rate of 100 Mkeys/s but only check their balances at 100 keys/sec (because scanning the entire blockchain is slow) then you are limited by that and never get to check as many methods/mangles/source material. You want to get the actual address check up to the same speed as the key generation rate. Probably impossible but if you limit the address list to some number that can be maintained in a memory based tree structure then you may be able to check, say, 1 MKeys/sec. So you ignore addresses with a balance of less than some amount and keep your key rate up. 
This allows you to run through a higher number of permutations of material and a wider range of source words or inputs. Another approach is to only check the balances of addresses involved in new transactions as they occur since each new block contains a very limited number of addresses. Or some combination - eg. the top 50,000 value holding addresses plus all new transactions. If you can run thru an entire scan in 10 minutes using whatever number of GPUs available then you pick up any old high value addresses plus use as many methods a possible for any new addresses being added to the chain - which seems to me like a good optimization.
New blocks get broadcast roughly every 10 minutes and it's quite easy to grab them with a script from bitcoind running normally. One approach would be to use as many GPUs as possible to scan each new block for as many input pass phrases as possible in 10 minutes. Any scanning that catches a balance within minutes is no doubt only scanning new blocks as they are added.

Doesn't Armory require the whole blockchain? Or has that changed? Why not Electrum instead?
Also, I'd note that before anyone uses this for substanial sums they should wait for third party auditing of the source code. It would be relatively easy to provide a solution like this with an RNG modified to produce seemingly good keys that are actually easily crackable.

Do you even know what the word "fiat" means? Maybe start with that and then see how that applies to money.
Bitcoin only has value as determined by the free market, ie. exactly the opposite of fiat.
