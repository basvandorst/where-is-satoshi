Why would a **Japanese company** CEO have to move to **any other country** to answer questions about his **Japanese company** ?
The fact some of his company's customers, aka the plaintiffs, live in the US doesn't put any kind of obligation for him to travel there to answer question.
And there is basically nothing that forces him to answer any customer's questions. Because customers, may they be domestic or foreign, do not represent any country's justice.

I live in France, and am a customer in the regional branch of a huge global bank.
My main point is that you won't convince people to use bitcoin with the "small fees" argument, because it's a false one : You will always find a bank with small or no fees. Plus you can usually ask for fees to be occasionally cancelled, and you can of course negociate rates with your banking agent.
@_date: 2016-11-16 11:56:05
Haven't been for 20 years. And ironically, some banks here take big fees from students accounts...
My bank, as many banks in my country, provide basic banking services for free. The fees you pay are for the times you spend more than you have or take a loan from them. Basic debit card is free as well, and the premium one costs 15€ a year (this varies a lot between banks). Money transfers, even abroad, are completely free. Money withdrawals are free except when abroad (0.15€ per 100€).

The only think that helps making BTC popular, is using BTC instead of USD or EUR to pay for stuff. In other words, having a significant number of BTC transactions is the only way to make BTC popular.
How much is "a significant amount" ? Well first get an idea of how many transactions happen using the regular currencies you're hoping to see replaced by BTC someday.

Did it ever occur to you that not everything is black or white?
In other words, have you ever considered that states being able to freeze assets, under specific well described conditions, under laws voted by People representatives, is not always a bad thing ?


I wish the people on this sub spent their energy on improving BTC, instead of spilling uneducated opinions biased by their vision of an economic world they don't know and don't understand.

And since you want to talk about the things that literally happened, aka *facts*, assets were frozen by justice orders. Which has nothing to do with banks stealing anything. *Banks don't get to keep a single cent from frozen assets*, especially under Hong Kong laws.

Sweet summer child.
Bitcoin is INSIGNIFICANT. And some even argue it's counter-productive. The biggest problem in our modern world, that makes people vote, talk to their representative and riot in the streets, is the unfair sharing of the world wealth.
Thinking you can fix this --or even help fix this-- with monetary tools, shows how far you are from understanding human systems and monetary tools.
You might be under the impression that Bitcoin matters, because you spend your days reading, talking, researching and jerking about it. But keep in mind that on the 7 billions of people on earth, only a few hundreds are part of that little group.
To sum it all up : You're part of a tiny drop of biased misinformed delusional people in a huge ocean of complex problems that can't be magically fixed by a new form of currency.

@_date: 2018-11-21 10:00:16
That's a fair point.
Seen from an economic point of view, the concept of HODLing to support BTC doesn't make much sense.
In order to make Bitcoin an efficient currency (in the very broad sense of this word), you need two factors :
* Liquidity : easy and quick conversion from and to other currencies (once again in the broad sense of this word)
* Small volatility : stable conversion rates from and to other currencies
Keeping big chunks of BTC from circulating doesn't help --and in fact handicaps-- BTC on both of these points.
What helps these two points, is having A LOT of transactions, small and big. For BTC to succeed, it has to "move" from one hand to one other, as often as possible. And the best example of this happening in the BTC domain is definitely on the darknet drug marketplaces. A lot of small to average to big transactions...too bad it's on something illegal (but from an economic point of view, it doesn't matter).
People HODL to show how much they trucs BTC to succeed as a currency. Which is awesome from a human point of view...but from an economic point of view, it's completely counter-productive. Catch 22 and all.

Second picture of the album: spending this on blow.
@_date: 2019-01-02 10:24:45
A lot of people don't seem to understand that Blockstream doesn't actually owns satellites in orbit, but has a somewhat shared access to a network of satellites, and can send data so it's broadcasted through this network. This means Blockstream does control the data that's being broadcasted, but not the broadcast itself.
There is a contract between Blockstream and a satellite operator, which most likely gives the satellite operator a certain level of control (at least an on/off button).
It shows Blockstream has world-scale ambitions with bitcoin. But on a technological level, it won't be significant till they launch innovative services on top of this network.
Oh and by the way, broadcasting data via satellite networks isn't as expensive as you might think. Most operators sell unused capacity, which is very well fit for use-cases with low and steady throughput...like bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-11-07 14:23:33
I highly doubt that.
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:53:54
I just posted another use-case that matters in a multi-billion dollar company, right above. Maybe it doesn't matter to you, but it does to this company and to their customers (as it greatly enhances a specific service).
Believing that any technological innovation can change the world without being used in the corporate world and used to fit in various use-cases is such a lack of lucidity, that I now am convinced your opinion doesn't make any sense at all.
Good day.
@_date: 2019-01-07 23:01:12
I should have written "the concept of a blockchain" in the comment you are replying to.
I won't go too far into the specifics, mostly because I don't know them well enough, but my company built an interesting system on top of a proof-of-work blockchain. It has **absolutely nothing to do with currencies** (most people in this thread don't seem to understand that it is even possible), but works wonders and brought technical improvements over our previous system.
But the killer points are :
* it enabled this service to be fully compliant with the law, which we used to have a hard time achieving and maintaining in the previous iterations of this service. Mostly because immutability isn't an easy thing to prove in the database world
* it became WAY easier to make the data available to the hundreds of services that rely on it. Even though the company uses dozens of OSes, languages and frameworks, all in an unexplainable mesh of internal networks.
* it was cheap to build, and it's cheap to operate.
To me what's key in the phenomenon that OP emphasizes is absolutely not the currency, but the concept of blockchains and the fact we can build innovative, feature-rich, highly scalable, reliable, cheap systems on top of it. And solve complex problems in such a nice way.
Currencies are an example...the first one actually. But I'm not even sure it's such a good display of what's possible.
*Edit: Spelling and accidentally a few words.*
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:11:21
There are many other applications that can rely on blockchains, than only currencies.
My company has built a few, the main one being the storage of people opt-ins and opt-outs which has a strong legal value in my country and field. The current implementation has replaced a solution that was quite expensive and annoying to maintain, due to the scale we run at and the constraints around this data-set.
It's not perfect, but it's reliable, cheap, and most importantly it exactly fits the legal needs.

Why not both ? It absolutely doesn't have to be white or black. As a matter of fact, technologies have proved to grow best when both public and private interests are involved.
The Open Source movement is an amazing example of contributing immensely to the modern world, while also generating an always-growing share of the world's wealth.
Some people contribute to open-source projects for fun. Others contribute for the money. Some build world-scale empires on top of it, with or without contributing back. Some succeeded and some failed miserably. But after a few decades we now have a huge and incredibly rich ecosystem where corporate interest and personal fun exist side-by-side.
You have to realize that excluding the corporate world from a field won't help it grow any better. And you also have to realize that it's not possible in the technological world.

In a few words : BTC's prime is in the past, and the value it still has is being artificially inflated by people who know that but haven't liquidated their BTC line(s) yet.
There's still money to be made in BTC. Problem is it's not thanks to the core values of the asset (decentralized currency, pseudo-anonymity)...but on the faith of people who HODL because they read posts like yours.
Don't take me wrong, I'm pretty sure you post this thinking a steadily raising ATL is a great sign for BTC's future. But as I said above, there's not much insight in the price alone. People with a sufficient knowledge of technical financial analysis know that, but most people who HODL don't, so they buy more...from the guys who want to liquidate.

Read my initial comment. I'm not talking about currencies here. What might really be the phenomenon mentioned in the OP is the concept of blockchain. The safe, simple, powerful and immutable ledger.
On top of this technology, you can build currencies. It was the first use-case. Did it change the world ? I personally think it did not, even though it was quite an innovation at the time.
But on top of this technology, you can build all sorts of applications. I give an example in another comment in this thread. And I do believe there are --and will be-- many great applications built on top of blockchains. And that in the end, currencies will be that noise you mention.
@_date: 2019-01-08 19:56:39
We're way past the point when papers were needed to spark interest. The success or failure of the concept of blockchain is tied to usage in the corporate world, not to proposals.

@_date: 2018-12-04 20:14:50
I did read it. Before I first posted, actually.
But throwing numbers (no matter how public and "true" they are) and talking about how curtailment is a thing in China, doesn't magically prove anything about Bitcoin mining being powered by renewable energies. And even if it did, it is still a huge leap to state that "Bitcoin promotes renewable energy" (this post's title).
Do you have any knowledge about how the "renewable" energy business works in China ? Heck, have you ever been to China ?
@_date: 2018-12-12 09:24:53


Logarithmic scales are a great tool when working on long-period graphs. It's also a great tool on values that went both up and down over time. And it's in fact even more meaningful on V-shaped (down and up) or W-shaped (down up down up) values. A great tool really, under the right conditions.
But it's a counter-productive tool when working on short history, and mostly upward values. Because then the graph doesn't hold that much information. It basically only says "on average it's going up" (or down).
What's worse is it gives non-savvy people a false impression of being able to see patterns. And that's precisely where the bias I mention in my previous post is.
My point is that the BTC value history isn't well fit for that type of graphs. Unless you want to make people think it will soon rebound and go way up, as the past pattern seems to show. Except the *real* technical hints don't show that, at all.
When a graph of that type is posted somewhere in the industry, the intent is to trick people into thinking there's a lot of value to be milked from an asset. The baseline under the graph usually says something like "slight correction, but it's going to rebound soon, as it did in the past...time to buy guys". But if you take a linear representation and factor in volumes, in a pure technical way this graph tells a completely different story.
I'm not saying your intent is this one. In fact it seems to me you have good intentions, and your edits seem to lean in that direction. Just be aware that this kind of graphs don't necessarily convey the message you think they do.
