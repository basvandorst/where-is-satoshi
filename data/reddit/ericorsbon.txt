Eh, they're just curious. I wouldn't take it as rude myself. And like others have said, you don't have to tell them. Or make it fun and ask them how much they have in their investment portfolio. Just my 2 cents!

You can also just ask "Okay, Google, what is the value of 1 Bitcoin?" I'm not sure if it's up to the minute current or what source it uses for the value. But quick and easy!

$100,000 (with a comma), not $100.000

Maybe cobsider adding: BTC means Bitcoin, BCH means Bitcoin Cash

That's odd. In the USA at least, every bank I've ever used requires you to fill out and sign a withdrawal slip so the amount withdrawn is captured with your signature. And I think they give a receipt as well.

I know... that was the most mind blowing part of the article to me. When you exchange $50 into BitCoin, guess what, you get $50 worth of BitCoin. How can anyone call that "expensive"? lol

I understand the sentiment, but the Bitcoin community is VERY different from the broader "internet" community.

I think they are referring to the fact that it's non-reversible, thus insecure in that regard for the buyer, which is correct.

"every Senator, Congressman, and Governor in the US" (from article body) is not "Every politician in the US" (from article headline). 
But whatever! lol. 
 Great letter!!!
