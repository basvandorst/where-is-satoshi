Same for me. Too lazy to move the bitcoins I have in cold storage, though, but those I had accessible I moved to doge. Litecoins I _did_ move from cold storage to warm doge.

Thanks for the info about bitcoin fees.
I'm content knowing dogecoin transactions are dirt cheap, but let's summon the OP, to learn about any formal fees of dogecoin transaction.

Great:)! Try  or its mother ship  which aims to heal veterans from PTSD.
And while waiting for the Red Cross to accept online currency charity, I can recommend a visit to  
Both accept bitcoin as well as dogecoin.

Let consumers decide what crypto to pay with, while you can optionally get paid in FIAT. That would really testing the waters, effectively reaching different demographics of cryptocurrency holders across bitcoin, dogecoin, litecoin, vertcoin, maxcoin...

I really never thought I'd do this: Empty my cold bitcoin storages like there was a fire. In my opinion, no matter what good happens, any layman will forever equate mtgox failures with bitcoin. Nevertheless, I'd like to direct my deepest gratitudes towards the bitcoin community, that brought cryptocurrency this far. Because, in any shape or form, cryptocurrency will prevail in the end. Thanks.

What haters miss out on, is that bitcoin/alt-coin-holders actually read what you're saying here. Me as well.
With all the trolling and disrespect, here and in the infamous troll box of btc-e, I more intensely believe in the generally downvoted happiness of the doge community. Like what was said in "The wolf of Wall street": "If you want a friend on Wall street, get a dog".
And incidently, that doge friend of mine just happens to be a somewhat equal store of value as any type of crypto currency.
So when choosing between hate and love, where do you think I'm going?
I'll keep my 50 btc in cold storage as always, and keep betting my liquid five-or-so btc on doge 'til the end. Just to see what a happy approach can do to crypto.
In the mean time you should really think very hard on how to respond to this message. I mean; The worst thing that could ever happen to bitcoin is possibly to start expelling bitcoin holders from the community.
