If you actually want to have an endgame, then your opening move should not consist of falling on your face and breaking your skull.
But who are we kidding? Congrats on scamming all that VC money.

@_date: 2016-08-27 20:38:56
the first part isright
@_date: 2016-08-15 19:41:08
AND yet we still count market cap by multiplying total coins X price ...
@_date: 2016-08-29 22:24:55

@_date: 2016-08-17 22:08:01

@_date: 2015-06-11 21:05:08

@_date: 2015-06-11 20:58:32

@_date: 2014-09-27 21:43:52
OP is really careless to depend on a card he'd already been having issues with though..
@_date: 2014-09-27 16:37:07
worlds is on right now, if you let people bet on their favorite teams , you'd get tons of signups.
literally tomorrow.
@_date: 2014-09-27 18:49:05
but given you're playing against completely anonymous competition you'd have to be insane to bet any real money
i guess small bets could work though

@_date: 2015-05-19 21:10:01
Do they have stock we can short?
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:40:31
if they've been waiting since bitcoin was 10$, chances are they aren't spending..

@_date: 2017-09-14 13:25:50
i assume with localbitcoins we have to send first?
or? does localbitcoins hold it in escrow or something?
AFAIK Paypal allows chargebacks for a ridiculously long amount of time...

@_date: 2017-09-15 02:48:14

@_date: 2017-09-15 03:35:58
i live in China, I use Alipay
I have Paypal too, but, I really dunno if I can trust the sellers on localbitcoins not to issue chargebacks...
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:50:52
well at least you put both options in there
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:59:50

@_date: 2017-09-14 13:13:34

local governments are heavily invested in bitcoin mining, perhaps
but currently Chinese across the country are getting scammed hard (ICOs, unregulated exchanges, etc..) ...
not to mention the whole currency outflow issue..
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:49:11

the bitcoin foundation wasted infinite money and bitpay is in the same boat
@_date: 2016-10-27 04:51:48
