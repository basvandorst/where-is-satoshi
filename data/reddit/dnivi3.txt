Where do you think the growth of and came from? It seems logical to me that the users that were banned would move to these forums, so I see the growth in these subreddits as an indicator of how many were banned during the XT debacle in July/August last year. Take a look at the subscriber metrics [here]( around early August 2015 when the whole debacle was happening, and you will see what I mean.

No, Gavin said that he thinks Luke-Jr fits the description of a poisonous individual and that Bitcoin might be better off without him. 
This is nothing compared to the vitriol, lies and conspiracies that have been thrown at Gavin, Mike and others that support a larger block size by for example Luke-Jr and other Core supporters.

Yes, everyone can use it how they please and run whatever software they like. However, the process by which what Bitcoin is is decided by is an extremely radical form of democracy. You do understand that, right?


What is the mathematical certainty you speak of? The software you are running and its parameters? For the second point I think it remains true, unless the people that use Bitcoin have similar values and visions for Bitcoin. 


I agree, decentralisation and trustlessness is important. What do you think of permissionlessness (i.e. the ability of anyone to use the network without having to ask for permission)? Do you think a moderately larger block size (for example, 4 MB) compromises decentralisation and trustlessness?

@_date: 2016-04-06 07:50:59


True, I don't get to decide what Bitcoins stands for. However, there are certain charateristics that the protocol has. One of these are uncensorability, unless you control a supermajority of nodes and can reject certain transactions. 


Bitcoin ***literally and technically is mob rule*** because the economic majority de facto decides what blocks are valid or not. You can stand against the mob rule with your own full node by not following the economic majority, but you will quickly see your bitcoins' value approaching nil because your bitcoins will not be accepted anywhere.


As I said earlier, I only have circumstantial evidence of the majority of active users being against the actions taken during the XT-debacle. Do you though disagree with me that the attacks were attacks on moderators' actions and not the subreddit itself?


I agree, and that is why we need public discourse, advocacy, information, developers, economists, and other experts informing the community. Censorship, banning of controversial opinions and fracturing the community is not something that is conducive to finding out what is right and wrong. 
@_date: 2016-04-08 12:58:21


It only makes the rules that protect Bitcoin's value meaningless in the long term if people do not agree to those rules. All of those values are up to change, but many of them are extremely difficult to change because a supermajority would have to agree to changing them. If you do not like or accept that Bitcoin is an extremely radical form of democracy for the users that run full nodes, I suggest you stop using Bitcoin. 


I disagree. If people are promised a certain vision, or sign up for a certain vision of Bitcoin by starting to use Bitcoin they are likely to want to maintain and uphold that vision. That is why Bitcoin's initial properties have not changed dramatically since the beginning.


The vast majority of Bitcoin-holders and users did not buy in at around 1 USD or any low value, so they have different concerns regarding valuation than you do. Yours truly is one example. You could absolutely continue using "your brand of Bitcoin", but the vast majority of users would probably not depending on what the properties of "your brand of Bitcoin" is. What are the essential properties of Bitcoin to you?

People don't get banned for dissenting opinions? How come I, and hundreds of other regulars, got banned during the XT debacle for supporting XT then? Many comments that oppose the current censorship, support XT, Classic or Unlimited are also ***automatically filtered out***. I have had my comments filtered out several times because of trigger words or phrases. 


Mind explaining how Mike Hearn attempted to subvert consensus? Also, your description of this is far from neutral and seems extremely biased. Shouldn't you take a more neutral stance as a moderator?
@_date: 2016-04-05 19:27:52


Yes, my evidence is circumstantial. That is all I have without moderators publishing their moderation logs for this period. People protested the moderation rules because the initial extremely popular posts of Mike Hearn explaining the rationale for Bitcoin XT was removed. There was, and still is, a very clear reason for the protests against the censorship and banning of "alt-clients". The moves were not attacking the subreddit, they were attacking the moderators for going against the wishes of the users of the subreddit by removing extremely popular and widely discussed content. 


Voting bots are not a good thing, I agree to that. Regarding brigading, I think it is silly to talk of them as such as users of etc. are overlapping subreddits with the same interests. 
@_date: 2016-04-05 09:16:02
This is my only account, and the ban I am referring to was during the XT debacle. You, along with the other moderators of at the time, banned thousands of users for support or merely participating in the discussions that raged about XT at the time. 


The consensus process of Bitcoin is not the BIP-process, it is nodes that decide what blocks are accepted or not. The BIP-process is a way for developers to formulate and propose changes to the Bitcoin-protocol. It also serves the purpose of informing the community of what the proposed changes are and for developers to champion changes. It is not ***the*** consensus process of Bitcoin, it is the consensus process of developers. What the consensus process really is what blocks are accepted by full nodes or not. 
If you are to continue using the term "non-consensus clients", I think you should amend it to include information on these clients not being in agreement with the developer community that disagrees with it (for example, Core disagrees with Classic and vice versa). 


How is it clear that "Mike Hearn was no friend of Bitcoin", how did he abandon the consensus process and force himself into a dictatorial role? Regarding Mike Hearn being the dictator of Bitcoin XT, I don't exactly see the problem. Bitcoin Core, Classic, Unlimited, XT, and BitPay Core (if that's what they call it) developers are all dictators of their respective implementations. 


Which conspiracy theories are you speaking of (not saying there aren't any, just wondering which ones you are referring to)? Maybe you should correct some of the huge misconceptions and stupid conspiracy theories that have saturated for quite a while too? For example, that Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn, and others supporting larger block sizes want to centralise Bitcoin to data centres, are bought by banks and are evil government spies. 
@_date: 2016-04-06 15:32:23


I think you are mischaraterising or misunderstanding my argument. My argument is not that Bitcoin has to be accepted everywhere or has to be popular with a mob, whatever you mean by that. My argument is that what constitutes Bitcoin (i.e. what constitutes a valid block) is determined by what parameters the supermajority of Bitcoin-nodes run on and that if you do not follow those parameters (i.e. run a Bitcoin-node or keep your money at a service that does not follow the supermajority of nodes), you will quickly see your bitcoins lose value. So, what Bitcoin constitutes is at any point in time determined by what rules are in place in the majority of Bitcoin-nodes. This is exactly what mob rule, or democracy if you like, is. Having sound money *with* a value is dependent on someone accepting it. The value of money is dependent on acceptance in one way or another. 


That is your opinion. I tend to think otherwise, that the plan of action was not bad nor that there was an endless stream of lies. Many others disagree with you and many agree with you too. I will leave it at that. How is it close to fraud? 


This is simply not true and shows that you have not spent much time in alternative forums. Many of the attacks you are thinking can also be construed as raising concerns that are legitimate. Some examples are raising concerns regarding: conflicts of interest, previous actions, expertise (technical, economic, etc.) and corruption that are not raised in other Bitcoin-related subreddits.

Apologies for the two-week late reply, I kind of forgot about our conversation.


Absolutely, what *you* consider Bitcoin is a personal decision. However, what the economic majority considers Bitcoin is a result of all of those personal decisions. This is why Bitcoin is a radical form of democracy. 


Absolutely, and I agree fully with this (as I am sure very many other in the Bitcoin-community does as well). 


What do you mean when you say "it would degrade the network"? Fewer full nodes staying online? I cited a 4MB block size increase because a [position paper]( claims that 90% of the network would still be able to stay online if a 4MB increase was implemented. Any thoughts on this?

I am basing this off circumstantial evidence of the inflow of subscribers to subreddits such as and at the time of the XT-debacle. Thousands is over-stated, maybe in the hundreds. If you take a look at the [growth metrics]( for it seems to coincide with the XT-debacle over here and widespread banning of a number of users. Is it possible for you to dig up and post moderation logs from this time to substantiate your claims that I am lying or incorrect that hundreds of users were banned? 


You did not respond to most of what I wrote about non-consensus clients. It is a nonsense term that makes little sense. See my previous comment.


What is meant here by "substantially larger blocks" and "greater centralization"? This [position paper]( shows that up to 90% full nodes of today's full nodes can remain online and cope with a 4MB block size.

Special interest? Some 60% of the hashing power resides within China.

It is, and so is the opposite assumption. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:30:20
@_date: 2015-12-07 10:33:37


This is all true, but also where it becomes tricky to really get a grasp of what an altcoin entails. If Bitcoin XT/BIP101 activates, it means that 75% of the hashing power votes for it. The result is that Bitcoin forks into two: one with 75% (or more) of the hashing power and one with 25% (or less) of the hashing power. So, in this situation we have a majority fork (Bitcoin XT/BIP101) and a minority fork (any non-BIP101 implementation). Can really a hardfork with the majority of the previous Bitcoin hashing power be considered an altcoin? If so, what is it an altcoin to? The original Bitcoin? What is the original Bitcoin?
Also, there are several problems with staying on the minority fork. Firstly, mining on the minority fork will slow down considerably since the difficulty is the same as before but the hashing power is much lower. This slows the network to a halt, rocketing block time way above 10 minutes. Until it readjusts (2016 blocks (14 days)) the minority fork will be unreliable, extremely slow and not economically viable for miners to mine on (the rewards will be less frequent and of lower value due to it being the minority fork). Secondly, the economic majority will see that it is in their best interest to switch to the majority fork because that is where the most hashing power, users and value is. Exchanges switching over to the majority fork will likely also trigger miners to switch over as they lose places to sell their mined bitcoins for fiat to pay for their electricity, rent and the like.


The problem here is that what is considered off-topic should not be considered off-topic becuase it is directly related to the future of Bitcoin. Bitcoin XT is an alternative implementation that happens to implement BIP101. How is this off-topic in any way? I understand that news about Ripple, Monero or whatever altcoin there is.

Which party would you rather have - an unaccountable corporation or a semi-accountable body of regulators that have to follow and enforce the laws that the US Congress passes? 


You are missing the fact that as good as all financial services company has in their Terms of Service (TOS) that you waive your right to sue them in any way and that you have to enter into arbitration. Such provisions in TOS are generally upheld in US courts and the Trump administration and the Republican-held US Congress has [voted to disallow consumers from suing companies that have such arbitration clauses/agreements in their TOS]( So, no, you cannot sue these companies or launch a class action lawsuit - it will be thrown out at the first court hearing. 


Regulation of exchanges and/or the on- and off-ramps for cryptocurrencies does not change the inherent properties or goals of the cryptocurrencies listed on said exchanges and/or on- and off-ramps for cryptocurrencies. Nobody is proposing that we regulate Bitcoin (which isn't really possible), they are proposing that exchanges and other services that deal in Bitcoin are subjected to common-sense regulation.

An increase in the maximum block size does not equate to blocks filling up. It might be that by the time we reach the 8GB blocks (if BIP101 ever activates), we do not have transaction traffic close to the block size limit. 
EDIT: why is this being downvoted? It is completely accurate that a larger maximum block size does not mean actually larger blocks.

This is such a large mischaracterisation of the BIP101 and XT debacle there can be.

185% annual inflation is not hyperinflation. 
Also, the 185% figure is from the black market IRR/USD exchange rates. With US unilaterally imposing sanctions again, the USD is probably a lot harder to exchange for than other fiat currencies that are controlled by countries or economic blocks that do not currently sanction Iran. It would be interesting to see the same implied inflation rate from the blackmarket with EUR as the currency instead, for example.

It's not a natural equilibrium if the block size (i.e. supply of block space) is artificially limited by a maximum block space. The only way a natural equilibrium of block space and transaction fees can develop is in a free market where no artificial limitations on the supply of block space exists.

Forced to subsidise the miner? Do you mean that the block reward goes to miner or do you mean the transaction fee? 
If transaction fees: they are optional and you can always decide not to include them. However, this brings on delays and risks that your transaction will never go through the network.
If block reward: we aren't subsidising anyone, the protocol is. How else would you incentivise miners to keep mining if there wasn't any block reward to be reaped? Higher transaction fees is an option, but then the users would actually subsidise the miners directly. Not sure if many users would like that option today.

Very much doubt that. Once the cat's out the bag, you can't really get it inside again. Oh, well they could, but they'd face backlash for sure. What I tend to ask myself is: "Why would they do that? What would their motivation be?" During the previous ban there seemed to be issues with the legality and regulations, so Apple was taking a careful stand on the issue. Now it's clearer that many large merchants allow it and there is nothing illegal with it, so why would they ban it? I doubt they fear Bitcoin as a competitor to Apple Pay anyways seeing how marginal Bitcoin currently is.

There is a way to get around this if you are jailbroken. I have succesfully used this method with CoinPocket. Here are the steps:
1.  Download CoinPocket with iTunes on your computer
2. Use iFunBox to transfer the .ipa-file to anywhere on your iOS device's file system
3. Install IPA Installer from Cydia
4. Open this app, go to settings and turn "Force installation" on
5. In IPA Installer, navigate to the folder where you transferred the .ipa-file of CoinPocket
6. Click on the .ipa-file of CoinPocket and it will install the app for you. 
It works flawlessly and does not seem to rely on any 7.1 APIs or the like!

OK, I think that we differ quite a lot when it comes to ideology. Most Europeans are not used to seeing guns carried in public, it just doesn't exists as a cultural thing. 


See, I find that scary. It makes me wonder how one cannot notice someone carrying a lethal weapon around for no reason whatsoever. I would generally be scared if someone unknown to me carries a gun around. I know nothing of their firearm training, their psyche, their intentions, nor their reactions to certain things. What if something I did could potentially be interpreted as threatening? Would I get a gun pointed at me? Would the person pull the trigger? Again, I know nothing of the unknown person, so anything can happen. Is that a situation one would want to find oneself in? It just seems like madness to me.
Seriously, there are so many factors involved in this, that I would be extremely scared wherever I went if I knew people were allowed by law to carry firearms around.
I shoud've worded myself more carefully regarding the constitutional rights. What I meant to point out is that gun laws, both in the constitution should be up for discussion and not be regarded as the ultimate source of truth regarding the matter. If practiced in such a way, it turns into a dogma. Regarding the constitutional rights, I understand that it is more or less a holy document in the US. That makes some of the constitutional rights, like gun laws extremely hard to discuss.
Freedom of speech should never be taken out of the constitution, simply because it is an essential tool to keep the government in check. The same goes for the other constitutional rights, but is gun owernship and public display of them necessarry to keep your government in check? After all, European countries keeps their governments in check without firearms or threats of violence. Even so, if you had firearms and was armed to the teeth, the government would always have the 'bigger guns' and the manpower to take down any 'public militia'.

Obviously some of us do care what the elderly or tech-illiterate do since we are having this discussion in the first place. Making Bitcoin as inclusive and easy-to-use as possible is really important for widespread adoption.

Why? Takes away the whole purpose of NFC in the first place. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 19:18:10
I agree completely with your points. However, the reason why I find it negative that they did not include any possibility of using QR-code scanning for payments is that literally every phone has a camera that can be used for scanning, but not every phone today has NFC. In less-developed/poorer economies, the people do not necessarily have the funds to get hold of an expensive phone with NFC. They just get a cheap phone with basic functionaility (which almost always includes a camera). So, essentially their solution misses a huge opportunity to include usage of earlier iPhone-units. 


20 years ago, no one understood the Internet, let alone use it. Still today, hardly anyone knows how it works except for "I can use it to communicate with friends or read news". However, billions use it every day. The same is true for smartphones and cellphones. 
That is because the Internet, cellphones and in turn smartphones gained an abstraction layer on top of themselves that takes hides all the tech from the end-user. So, users do not need to know how it works on a technical level, they only need to know that they can read news, watch cute cat videos and find porn on the Internet and how they do those things. The same is true for a cellphone or smarphone, I don't know how the tech works, I only need to know that I click here to send a message, here to open Facebook, here to call my dad, here to browse porn and here to play games.
Bitcoin does not have an abstraction layer laid on top of it yet, and as such most people do not use it. Once the abstraction layer is laid on top, Bitcoin's prime time has arrived.

This is not about Bitcoin's emotions or values, this is about the construction of a technology and how the sociopolitical circumstances and values of the creator influences the features of the technology. Bitcoin is a decentralised technology which in itself is an embedded political statement that the creators want decentralisation over centralisation. The same is true of universal access (provided you have a computer); it is a statement of non-exclusion. 
For all the noise that people make over today's banking technology being a political tool for centralisation, oppression and control by the government, how can one fail to notice that Bitcoin has the opposite value set embedded in the very core technology it uses?

1. Sign up for an exchange. I recommend [Justcoin]( or [Kraken](
2. Get verified on either of the two platforms by submitting your name, address, phone number as well as ID-documentation (ID-card/passport and usually a utility bill/bank statement), verification is usually quite quick on Justcoin as well as Kraken
3. Add your bank account to your account on Justcoin or Kraken
4. Initiate a bank transfer to either of the two platforms via the service's bank account (SEPA if within Europe or International Wire if outside Europe)
5. When credited, start trading/buy some bitcoins!

You make the foolish mistake of assuming that technology is neutral. Remember who builds technology? People do, and people are by definition not neutral. As such, every technology will always have (sociopolitical) values embedded in them. Bitcoin is a great example of this, because it is obvious that it is a anti-government, anti-establishment and anarchistic technology. The discourse surrounding Bitcoin is also evidence of the non-neutrality of Bitcoin.
I hardly think that Satoshi built Bitcoin as a neutral tool because it has the above mentioned characteristics.

Thanks for categorising many of us as "druggies". We are not all here for drugs being legal or regarded moral to do. In all honesty, it is also not relevant where we stand on this issue. The case is not about drugs, it is about Internet freedom, privacy and legal misconduct by the law enforcement. 
As mentioned several times in the video, the law enforcement are attempting to expand their laws to cover and ever-larger scope of cases and situations. Ross has been charged with all kinds of charges that he himself should not be liable for. He only created the Silk Road as an anonymous market place and not as a platform exclusively devoted to illegal materials. It's ridiculous that he shall be indicted, charged and possibly imprisoned for something he has little to no control over, namely his users' actions. 
A useful analogy to draw here is that of eBay, Amazon, Craiglist or any other platform that allows for sale of goods and services. Should they be held responsible for the criminal actions of their users? I think not, because eBay or their employees are breaking no laws, users are.
The case of Ross Ulbricht is very similar because, in the end, all he did was to provide a platform in which users could sell and buy goods and services. He should not be held responsible for actions that he has little to, no control over, namely his users' illegal activities.

Is it necessarry that people carry their weapons around to potentially fight the government every day of the week? What purpose does it serve that people are allowed to carry a weapon around all the time? Wouldn't it be enough to be allowed have a cache of weapons hidden in your house in case your government becomes too corrupt?
So, essentially you are saying that the people should be able to break the government's 'violence monopoly'? 


Of course, but there are other ways of keeping one's government in check. Free and fair media, which is arguably lacking in the US, is one such tool. Citizens' awareness of government's actions, which stems from free speech and the media is a very powerful tool to keep your government in check. 
I am not quite sure if the Egyptian population having weapons during the Egyptian revolution would change anything. They toppled the regime, without the use of gun power, didn't they? Maybe it would have gone faster with weapons, but I believe it would only have resulted in a bloodbath and a possible civil war. Is that desirable?

Same experience here when learning basic macroeconomics. The basic rationale is that consumers will put of their using their money as they recognise the value of the money will rise in the future(ie. they can buy more with less). Because spending is decreased, the economy as a whole shrinks (or decelerates) which most likely will result in unemployment and possibly widespread economic depression.
What I do not understand is why there aren't more actors in the Bitcoin-community that are worried by this. If Bitcoin indeed becomes deflationary, what do we do? Will people quit spending their income (except for basic purchases such as food, utilities and the like)? If so, what is a solution to that problem? There is no form of monetary and fiscal policies that are possible to implement (unless a central authority seizes control of the development of the protocol and makes changes that would facilitate fiscal and monetary policies). There is no quick fix and if the Bitcoin-economy fails it looks like, IMO, that it will take a lot of time, pain and tears to recover.

OP/Circle's explanation is not put in the best terms. What OP/Circle is referring to is the fact that there is no single entity that handles and confirms Bitcoin-transactions. 
For normal transactions from person-to-person or in a brick-and-mortar store there is no reason to use escrow/multisig because you get the goods/services immediately. 
However, if you are for example buying something used online from an eBay-like marketplace it can be useful to have arbitratation in the form of escrow/multisig available. This is because 1) you have to wait to actually get the product and 2) you are buying it from an untrusted entity (ie. not a large corporation). Therefore, if escrow/multisig is used and you have a reliable arbitrator it is thought that faulty products, scams and the like can be avoided because one would notify the arbitrator to not release the funds.

I am not quite sure what you mean with successfull. If you are talking about price or market cap, sure I agree with you. However, it is a bit besides the point I am trying to make though as their PR and public image is amazing compared to Bitcoin. Dogecoin has a very good image in the public because the community is extremely charitable, keen on promoting themselves and welcoming to noobs. has simply not been as good at this.

Well, if they live in Norway and have a Norwegian bank account they can join Justcoin, buy bitcoins and then use Rebit to send money home. However, I am wondering whether it is cheaper or not because [three Filipino banks have correspondent accounts with banks in Norway to allow for remittance transfers]( 
From the linked article you can also see that Norway has a huge Filipino remittance (fourth largest in the world in 2011; $352.8 million USD) market and hence there is a large opportunity for rebittance there. If the costs of transfering via the corresponding bank accounts are higher than rebitting, there is a huge market opportunity for rebit there.

This is the normal behaviour of Breadwallet. It changes the receiving and sending address for every transaction you make out of security and privacy reasons.

While the economy is well-run, the oil and accompanying markets dominate the economy resulting in an upwards pressure on wages. It is not healthy nor sustainable for the future (both economically and environmentally) that all the engineering talent, or even the top talent, goes towards the Norwegian oil industry because it 1) accelerates economic growth due to one large market, 2) discourages and heavily steals talent from other industries 3) puts an upwards pressure on all wages since the oil companies can pay tons of money for top talent. 
In Norway we call this effect "oljesmøring av norsk økonomi", which basically means that the Norwegian economy is, and has been, oiled for growth.

You are right about the waiting window between new iOS-releases and when a jailbreak for that version comes out. That wait is why many decide to stay on the previous version before a new jailbreak is out (including yours truly).
It doesn't void your warranty because there is no sign of you jailbreaking. If you restore back to normal, there is literally nothing that can indicate you were once jailbroken. Also, I think in most countries, including the US, modifying stuff you own is entirely legal so there is nothing illegal or warranty-voiding about jailbreaking.

Hm, this could definitely be useful for other Bitcoin-related projects such as [Bitcoin Core]( [Armory]( [BitcoinJ]( and [Hive Wallet]( (the selection is rather random, I am sure there are tons of other projects that could benefit from integrating something like BitHub for encouraging contributing to F/OSS-sofware).
I can also see it being useful for integration of bug-bounties and rapid development of open-source exchanges. Imagine, if an exchange wants people to contribute to their codebase and all they have to do is to issue a large amount of funds into the wallet of their autonomous BitHub-client. Then developers flock to the repo to help improve the codebase and add new functionality.

I don't think anyone has said anything about tipping small amounts *inside* it's mostly concerned with tipping *outside* of (and other digital currency related subreddits). 
As much as you get excited about receiving a few bits (I do too), people that are not already involved with Bitcoin or digital currencies do not get as excited simply because they see a miniscule amount of money tipped to them. That is why it is considered as an insult by some; that the amount is just too small to even be bothered to collect. 




No one is trying to force you to accept someone's viewpoint; redditors are simply advising and discussing what should be considered 'good conduct' regarding tipping. You choose to follow it or not, so it is entirely up to yourself how much you want to tip. However, if you tip cents in other subreddits, you will not make any impact, rather, you will get ignored or even ridiculed (that is my experience and observations so far).


The overwhelming majority of people do not think this way.

People's perception/view/opinion of fundamentals change though, depending on their perspectives. The fundamentals might be the same, but can be interpreted in numerous ways.
For someone that is actively looking up news and following the Bitcoin-community, the fundamentals will be overly positive because we are all so damn excited about Bitcoin and it's potential. For someone from the 'outside' I can assure you it looks different. They see a quirky piece of technology that a small group of people are extremely enthusiastic about.

And, if you'd actually take a look at the threads instead of only the titles you'd see it's genuine parody/satire. Most of the are funny and seriously, if we can't tolerate some healthy parody and satire we're in deep shit here. It means we're too sensitive and can't handle it like adults. It confirms everything that has been saying all along: that we are zealots which do anything to support Bitcoin, despite its flaws.
Seriously, don't ban this bot, it'll only backfire and make the whole subreddit look bad. Parody and satire is good, it gives another perspective and shows ourselves how we might look from the outside.

I assume this is the section you are referring to:




It is not clear what they mean by this. Reports I have read and the released information on Apple Pay points towards the "information needed to complete a payment transactions" and the "cryptogram, unique to the specific purchase" refers to one-time usage payment identifiers, and not credit/debit-card or bank account information.
The detailed developer reference is situated here: [Payment Token Format Reference](
There are some classes that seem interesting with regards to finding out if the credit/debit-card information is transferred and is possible to decrypt like you said. These are "paymentData" (described as "payment data dictionary" and "detailed payment data"), it's also interesting that the expiry date is transferred (see "applicationExpirationDate") and that name of the card holder is optional (see "cardholderName").

Yep, only on-device though, in a hardware space called the Secure Medium (think Trezor for credit/debit card info; similar to where Touch ID fingerprints are stored in the iPhone 5S). Only a unique one-time identifier is transferred while paying for stuff, so no sensitive details are actually transferred. Quite cool, but a bit of a clunky solution compared to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 00:37:44
Not true. Confirmation time of ~5-10 minutes versus crest cards/debit cards having confirmation time of days. 
Also, it is possible to track the propagation of a transaction through the Bitcoin-network which, in its essence, indicates the confidence of the transaction. Basically, the higher the network propagation the higher the confidence in the transaction. If the network propagation is high, both parties in a day-to-day transaction can safely assume that the transaction will be confirmed very soon. This is possible to do within seconds and a wallet/merchant app can automatically check this 5-10 seconds after the transaction so that both seller and buyer can get done with the trade.

Have you taken a look at Justcoin? Solid, Norway-based exchange with trade fees starting at 0.5%, going down to 0% if you trade 100+BTC (about 60,000 USD) a month. This is about 6% of what Kraken requires you to trade a month get a fee of 0.05% which Kraken requires 1,000,000 USD a month for.

Supporting decentralised exchanges and regulation of centralised exchanges are not mutually exclusive, because they are two solutions to the same problem.
I think any exchange should be regulated in some way. Certain procedures should be enforced by regulation, and if not followed, an exchange should be fined. Examples: 
* cryptographic proof of reserves
* multisig for all wallets (so that a lone employee can not run away with the funds)
* separation of business and personal wallets of employees
* proper cold storage setup with enforced 90-95% of reserves in them

OK, so I started looking at the patent now. Pretty dry, but still interesting. Found some interesting sections so far: 
Page 1:


Seems to me like the assets will be uniquely identified to unit's UDID's. Interesting approach, compared to block chain based currencies which use addresses. A bit worrying though, that the assets are tied to a unit's UDID because then they are not necessarrily distributable accross several devices like with Bitcoin if you have the same private key(s) on more than one unit. 
Same page, another passage covering how assets are distributed, again with UDID's: 


Page 2, [0029], talking about the benefits and risks of "virtualized wallets":


Page, [0030], talking about "virtualized mediums of exchange (VMEs)". I've highlighted some interesting parts that seem to reference/pay attention to Bitcoin and Bitcoin 2.0 projects:


no actual value, e.g., electronic coupons, electronic vouchers, electronic tickets, electronic passes, etc. It should be understood that **this description is not limiting and that the described embodiments can be used to distribute anything useful and/or valuable**. Furthermore, VMEs can be implemented within a wide variety of data structures that vary in complexity (e.g., strings, arrays, objects, **cryptographic elements**, etc.); for example, simple implementations can be a simple account number, more complex implementations can incorporate account information, and/or check values. **In some cases, a VME can provide additional features such as, e.g., cryptographic protection, accountability (i.e., transactional history), anonymity, fraud detection, etc.**

I don't know if he has said anything negative about it either though, so his stance is a bit unclear. His problems with it has been related to tax compliance within the US and EU (basically said he cannot control where the money comes from, which I believe can be solved by Cydia requiring users to enter their address/personal information; also the payment processor he'd use would be responsible for blocking connections from countries that are sanctioned), which I am not very acquinted with. IMO it seems a bit cowardly, as several US and EU-companies do in fact accept bitcoins as payment.
Use Amazon Payments? PayPal is quite shite, but I've heard Amazon Payments gives a bit of a larger cut. Another alternative would be to tip developers when they have giveaways (not that often I know) and request to get tweaks in return. I've done it, last week in fact, and received two tweaks!

A way to do it is to attempt to write code/find source code online that pulls the historical value of a bitcoin from one long-standing exchange. Bitstamp is one example as they have data all the way back since 2011. There might also be solutions or data online that lists the average/weighted value between the different exchanges. Maybe bitcoincharts.com has some data on this?
You might want to set a time interval for which you average the exchange rate in that specific time interval. Then, any transaction that took place during that time interval will be assigned the average exchange rate for its designated time interval.

You are talking about transaction cost, which is separate from transaction fees. Transaction fees are paid by users, while transaction cost is the average mining reward + transaction fees *per* transaction in each block.
By the way, I did not question whether or not the transaction cost is $25-30, I questioned who *actually pays that cost*.

Unfortunately only your first point is true. Storing bitcoin costs money because one has to pay for storage capacity (however neglible it is, it does cost). Maintaining bitcoin costs a lot, just look at how much is being spent on mining rigs and electricity associated with that. Maintance costs also includes development of the Bitcoin-core, so there's another cost. And it does cost a tiny bit to transfer to anyone in the world.

You gotta be careful and not install software from random repos. The tweaks and apps in default repos are reviewed for potential malware before they're released into the wild.

Is your world coloured in black and white? It certainly seems so from your argumentation and complete denial of any argument that opposes you. There is no such thing as truth, there are only partial truths that are either true/false based upon context.
In the case of Scandinavia this is what we know:
* The government, or some proxy, invests in up-and-coming businesses or established businesses to bolster growth and innovation
* There are numerous funds that are supported by the government in some way (ie. funding, loans, etc.) that are allocating the investment capital (ie. the investment decisions are not taken by the government)
* This model has bolstered growth and innovation in many forms, but has probably also produced startups that have failed (this is an inherent risk in investment and could happen to any investment firm/fund be it governmentally-supported or private)
* The Norwegian government for example has an investment fund called ['Government Pension Fund of Norway']( which is worth about $700 billion. This fund is managed by professionals and has grown considerably over the years. 
Therefore, it can be shown that sometimes, governmental investment can indeed bolster growth and innovation. It can also do the same, just as is the case with any other investment.
Maybe I've been a bit categorical in my argumentation and I apologise for that. Some of your arguments are valid, but you are applying them to a range of situations that are not relevant to the discussion. Just because the government sometimes causes decay and is 'evil', doesn't mean that every government is 'evil' and causes decay.

I don't think it takes too much to beat Bitcoin, as it is miniscule in the larger sense. It pales in comparison (for volume and use, that is) to payment networks that already exist. 
Bitcoin's network effect is arguably small at best, if not minimal. We might have a few services and places to spend bitcoins, but it is not enough to hinder people from using a different kind of cryptocoin or payment network. Actually, the fact that so few actually own bitcoins in the first place makes the network effect so mcuh more insignificant. 
The features of Bitcoin can easily be beaten, just fork Bitcoin and start developing new and better features. It has been done numerous times with altcoins and if someone with the financial resources, dev power and will power wants to they can create a coin that is better. Why they haven't done this yet? Maybe they are doing it right now, or maybe Bitcoin is not seen as a threat yet?

@_date: 2014-09-26 12:28:51


Yes, I agree with that. Receiving funding from any source does not imply success, for any business. This is true for any investment funds or seed funds that fund startups. It is an inherent risk in investing into startups that they might fail and not get successful. 


Then how did Tesla get a $500m federal loan? Did they trick the government into giving them the loan? I don't get your argument. 


Nope, disagree fully with you. There is no rule that companies that receive funding or loans or whatever from the government are incompetent. As I said earlier, in some cases they might be incompetent and in some cases not. This is also the case for any private investment funds because it is not easy to know if a company is completely incompetent or spends their funding unwisely or something similar. 


OK, Coinify seems to be doing well. They've signed up about 6000 merchants in Europe so far, including some large retailers in Denmark (example being hungry.dk for ordering fast-food online).

Maybe you are right about the spending part, because all the goods are sold in relative value to the goods'/services' value in fiat currencies. Therefore, for a user that bought BTC a while ago, at a lower price, has a lower fiat currency price for that same good/service. Therefore, since goods/services seem cheaper users that bought in at a lower price earlier are inclined to spend.
However, a user that buys BTC today and expects the price to rise will put off spending it until the price of BTC has risen. Isn't this is a problem as it causes people to put off their consumption?
While I have in fact never used any BTC and I only hold a very small amount of BTC (mainly from sporadic giveaways), I am puzzled as to how having used Bitcoin would help me understand this?

Obviously he disagress with you. If you'd read the original article and comments in this thread you'd see it is not the government getting involved directly, it's a fund (SEED Capital) that receives some funding from the Danish government. Funding is good, from whatever source, if you are a cash-strapped business that wants to grow and has a bright future.


Yes, it does. It gives small and large fundings to several companies a year. Some of the companies are successful, some of them are not, just like everywhere else.


One cannot build a bright future without the necessary funding. Therefore, they applied for funding from "SEED Capital [which] is partly supported by Vækstfonden, the Danish government’s fund for creating growth in new companies." They don't need funding from the government specifically, they needed funding from any interested investors.

That is today, with low adoption rates. As more merchants and more people start using bitcoin, the volatility will decrease as speculation is not the main driver of the price anymore. Almost no merchants support or accept bitcoin today, that is true. However, how many merchants had their own website in the Internet's infancy? Almost none, simply because the technology was hard to access and get a grip on. That is exactly the situation bitcoin is in; infancy. Give it a year or two and you will see digital currencies accepted and used by many more merchants, users and institutions.

Desktop wallets are Bitcoin-wallets in which your private keys are (most likely) stored encrypted on your computer. Examples of desktop wallets are Electrum, Hive (OSX), Bitcoin-qt and the like. 
An online wallet is typically a service which hosts your private keys for you (very likely encrypted with your password; if not, steer away!). These are typically accessible from your web browser. Examples are Blockchain.info, Greenaddress.it, Xapo and the like. 
The real difference between the two are where the private keys are stored and how safe that storage is. If you are tech-savvy, or read up on it, you can create very safe desktop Bitcoin-storage with the use of paper wallets or a different type of cold wallet. If you are not that tech savvy, or do not want to read up on it, use an online wallet. However, *do not store large amounts old money in it, it is not entirely secure!*
For the exchange, I would recommend Justcoin.com, a Norway-based secure exchange. They support SEPA-transfers, have snappy identity confirmation and great support!

No, the oil business/sector is not the only sector that pays well. All sectors pay relatively well, but the oil sector is really at the top. What I meant with Norway's economy being 'oiled' is that all the capital sunk into oil business competes with other sectors and as such all other sectors will have to adjust to the 'oil-inflated' price and wage level. So, essentially the oil sector runs captures the best talents and the other sectors have to up their efforts to get good talent.

Couldn't agree less with you, this conflicts with the core values that Bitcoin promote: freedom and voluntary agreement. Forcing someone to keep their mined bitcoins is not going to solve the price decline.
Also, how do you suppose miners will pay for their electricity if they cannot convert their mined bitcoins to fiat? It's not like energy companies accept bitcoins yet.
I agree as much as anyone else on the unfair distribution of Bitcoin, but locking mined bitcoins is not a solution.

Creating a bank is extremely difficult, doubt this will ever happen. Also, it'd be inconvenient to have one bank that presumably operates globally for Bitcoin exchanges. Local banks are faster locally, so it wouldn't be as useful as you suggest. 
Also, the problem is also that banks do whatever they want to. They can block payments and close accounts on a whim, without much reasoning behind it. Justcoin's bank closure is one example since dealing in Bitcoin is not illegal or particularly disfavoured by the central banks. I honestly think they (banks) are afraid and are working together to stifle Bitcoin exchanges,

If you get hold of their emails you can easily send them any amount of bitcoin from the Blockchain-wallet (or some other wallet (?) I am not that familar with all the options). It creates a new wallet, private key, address and they can set their own passwords.

Seriously, this is like the fifth article posted about this and they are still attempting to hit the front page. They are getting more and more desperate and more and more sensationalistic. First, the title makes it sound like 400 independent banks are now allowing direct Bitcoin purchases. It should've said bank branches, because that's really what it is.
Secondly, the page smells fishy. They are not an exchange, they are selling and buying Bitcoin as well as other digital currencies. Their webpage states that they have about 25 BTC available in their reserves. Does not sound like an exchange with floating exchange rates to me.
EDIT: there is also absolutely no information on their webpage about their fees for the service, which seems a bit weird.

Yes, it was pretty obvious. I called this out when the tipping spree started, but was downvoted into the negatives. ChangeTip also openly announced on Coinality (the job posting was removed a while ago) that they were looking for community managers a few month ago and that they would command paid tippers. 
As much as I like and encourage people to tip using ChangeTip, employing paid tippers that are obnoxious and tip everywhere is too much. I understand it is preferred that it becomes popular, but that won't happen by employing paid tippers. At least instruct your paid tippers not to tip absolute everyone and everywhere. Tip where it is appropriate and try to follow some sensible guidelines. Quality over quantity.

Couldn't agree more with OP, tipping less than a dollar is just going to piss people off and make people pull up the "greedy butters trying to get more people to adopt Bitcoin". This has been seeen happening numerous times in various subreddits.
I usually tip a coffee, a beer or some other moniker that's more than $2. Why? Because you are showing people that you are giving them something of actual value. No one likes getting a few cents of a digital currency they don't even use. If you give them a decent amount they'll most likely not let it go to waste and it'll introduce someone new to Bitcoin.

The creators of employ paid tippers (they had an ad up on Coinality earlier this month for community managers, which included paid tippers), so this is most likely why we are seeing some users tip substantial amount of bits to many users. The creators seem to have done their work on creating a viral campaign/phenomena of tipping.
Tipping on Facebook already works, it is just clunky. You have to give the ChangeTip-app access to your account and from the ChangeTip-website you can tip someone directly on their wall. It doesn't seem like they have figured out how to do it as seamlessly as on Twitter, YouTube, GitHub and Reddit yet (probably due to the nature of Facebook's commenting system).

For the average user an iOS-unit is safer than most Android-units simply because the system is closed and the user cannot install or grant apps permission to install and fiddle around with their system whatever the fuck way they want. Unlike an advanced user they have almost no way of finding out what the fuck is fucking their units over. 
However, for the advanced user (think Bitcoin-enthusiasts) Android or a jailbroken iOS is more secure because they are in control of whatever the fuck happens on their unit. There is no way that the average user will do and take all the precautions that the advanced user takes and therefore a closed, or semi-closed system with tight permissions, is more secure for most to all average users.

Wikileaks does not and very likely will never facilitate sales of secret information like Slur wants to. Essentially it seems like a highly illegal (and immoral) service providing users with the ability to buy and sell secret information.

A joke to investors maybe, but to consumers no.

Thanks for replying. You might want to be a bit more subtle in your endorsements. As I said, 8 out of your last 10 (now 9 out of 11) posts were directly promoting AnycoinDirect.
I think some of the reason why people aren't as excite about AnycoinDirect is because is advertising it very aggressively on I see it constantly being recommended on here to Europeans and it just frankly gets annoying. If I wanted advertisements I wouldn't go to Reddit, I'd watch TV or read some shit newspaper that has tons of advertisements. Reddit is a discussion platform, not a place to constantly advertise your services.

Not too sure of that, I am Norwegian too and all they know is bank information. No social security numbers (personnummer). Those numbers are in centralised state-controlled database which companies are only granted limited access to as far as I know. I think Justcoin relied on the banks to do that to verify customers, and not by themselves. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 18:24:45
Well, a simple reason for removing their personal information from the about-page might be that they do not want users to contact them directly and instead contact support. They might also want to avoid users harassing them in social media, which is absolutely fair.
@_date: 2014-10-05 12:35:03
This all depends on where you are situated, what banking options you have and what kind of information you are willing to give up to a third party.
If you are in Europe, go with any of the popular exchanges. I personally like [Justcoin]( (but that's maybe because I am Norwegian and they are as well). They accept SEPA-payments, are quick to verify users' identity and have great support! 
If you are in the US, go with [Coinbase]( (bank transfers or link your bank account) or [Circle]( (bank account or credit/debit card). 
Most exchanges that accept bank deposits require you to verify your identity due to AML/KYC-laws, so be prepared to submit your ID-card and a recent utility bill to prove your identity and registered address. 
If you are really looking for the easiest way, I'd advise you to go ahead an use [Circle]( This requires a credit/debit card registered in your name.

Cool infographic from the article: 
Note that Bitcoin has been depicted with the following steps before it reaches the merchant:
1. QR-code or email address [sending]
2. Digital Wallet (on computer, phone or online)
3. Blockchain
However, other solutions such as Google Wallet and PayPal are only depicted with one step before the funds arrive at merchants: 
* PayPal Wallet
* Google Wallet Phone App
While the infographic represents Bitcoin's purchase/technical flow more accurately, it also displays it as containing more steps than other solutions.

This is so misguided that it just hurts. Apple's payment network, or whatever one wants to call it, will most likely be supported by credit/debit cards or even linked to people's bank accounts. It is fair to assume that most iPhone-owners also have a credit/debit card or bank account available for use. If Apple's payment network is using credit/debit/bank account information/payment system as its backbone it will immediately work everywhere the above is accepted. That is a lot of places, heck - almost all places, both online and in brick-and-mortar stores. So, the network effect of Bitcoin pales in comparison to traditional credit/debit cards' or bank accounts'.

What arms race? If you are referring to jailbreak developers using considerable time to release their jailbreak exploits to the public, then yes that is annoying. However, it is worth it in the end because the possibilities that one has when one jailbreaks are endless (like on Android, but prettier IMO and on my favourite mobile OS)! If you are referring to Apple patching bugs that make it able to jailbreak, then why? It is a non-point in my opinion as most jailbreakers just stay on whatever version of iOS that is the latest possible to jailbreak. For example now, and until iOS 7.1 (when released) is going to be jailbroken most jailbreak enthusiasts will stay on 7.0.4(/5). That is somewhat similar to Android devices unless you root and install your own ROM because the updates from manufacturers (for example Samsung) are few and long between.
Jailbreaking is not much of a hassle either, often much less hassle than rooting an Android phone. It is a one-download and one-click procedure for any iOS-device which literally takes five minutes. So, I am not quite sure what you are referring to whilst writing that you were "surprised by how much hassle I had to put up with" when you switched to Android. It might have been that two years ago, the jailbreaks were less user-friendly but as I can remember it was still a rather simple one-download and one-click procedure to jailbreak any iOS-device. Heck, even back in 2008 when I got my first iPhone (2G, by the way) it was almost a one-click procedure except having to knock the phone in DFU-mode (restoration-mode).

I can agree with your points on reddit gold being different, however, both are tokens of gratitude towards the posts that a redditor makes.


Reddit is a platform for users, by users. If a subreddit wants to ban tipbots, then be it. It's their choice after all. Again, I very much doubt that *reddit admins* would ban tipbots. Subreddit moderators is another story, but we'll see about that.


I have no direct financial gain nor do I have any intent to make a user that I tip adopt Bitcoin. All I want to do is to show my gratitude towards that user. For me, it is a selfless gift as well. Additionally, it is debatable if reddit gold is a selfless gift. It might just well be used to promote certain opinions as posts receiving reddit golds are almost automatically presumed to be good or correct. So, it is more of a grey-area than black/white like you suggest.


Tip it forward to someone else to show *your* gratitude towards them? [Buy some reddit gold]( (choose 'ongoing subscription' and then any duration)? Give it to good causes (for example [World Aid which helps homeless children worldwide]( or [RNLI - Royal National Lifeboat Institution]( which saves lives on the sea in the UK)?
I agree with your concerns regarding small tips, they aren't really worth it it unless you get a lot of them. I always try and tip $5+ USD and hope that peple are grateful for whatever I give them. I've tipped about $120+ successfully in various subreddits including and People usually accept the tips if they are large enough.
And, I found it very funny in the above thread you linked that [someone tipped the same user 420doge]( (which is basically nothing, even less than the bittip 'flung' at the OP) without receiving downvotes.

No, finger prints are stored in the Secure Enclave, a separate chip/part of the CPU. 
The finger print data never leave from there. The only thing that is stored/goes through the Keychain/is exposed to the live OS is whether or not the fingerprint on the scanner is correct. 
This is also the case with jailbroken iOS-devices as there are no known ways to get to the Secure Enclave.

Of course, but once a malicious actor gets hold of both pieces it is much easier to figure out what the private key is than with the visually encrypted private key. 
Also, there might be practical issue with QR-code representations of private keys cut in half. For example, how do you make absolutely sure that the two pieces are aligned when you need to scan them? How do you make sure that they are perfectly cut in half, or four, or eight for that matter?
A better method might actually be to just write down half/four/eight/sixteenth/etc of the private key and store them in different bank vaults. With this of course, they need to be numbered so that the pieces of the puzzle can be set in the correct order.

Yeah, but again, it rules out most of the world for receiving settlement in their native currency via a payment processor. 
If they'd just chosen a global Bitcoin payment processor we wouldn't have to worry about this. It's a bad decision by PayPal, unless they allow merchants to choose in the near future. It totally defeats the purpose of Bitcoin: a global currency and payment network.

Thanks for a well-explained answer. I am aware of how the blockchain works. 
I think I should have clarified in my first post that I was referring mostly to that in the future, as bitcoin is adopted more and more, more of the full nodes, miners and storage will have to be devoted to keeping the Network alive. That costs more energy, storage and computing power and these will all increase over time as adoption rises.

While you are correct that as of now Apple has not allowed apps to directly interface with each other/with a cloud services without that feature "being baked into the app", jailbreak developers have created frameworks to enable that. However, if I am not incorrect, is this not a feature that has to be enabled in Android as well (ie. granting the app the permissions it needs to communicate with these services and connecting Dropbox/GDrive/etc)? 
Changing the default browser is not possible by default, but if you jailbreak you can do it. Any default app can in fact be replaced by tweaks that open for example calendar-entry links in a different calendar-app or the like. While this is not made system-wide as in Android it is possible.

It's debatable whether the hack was Justcoin's fault. 
Ripple Labs had known about the possibility of exploiting their gatewayd-implementation of tfPartialPayment for months, yet never contacted developers about it. Furthermore, RL's documentation was incredibly unclear and gave no explicit warning about this particular issue. On top of that, Ripple Labs' official products such as RippleTrade, Ripple Graph and the like was affected by the same error in implementation that Justcoin's implementation was. Even their reference client for Ripple gatewayd was implemented incorrectly.

You kept it secret for months until it was revealed to the public, not by you or anyone at CCEDK, but by someone else. 
You have also pretended to be satisfied customers on the Scandinavian-subforum of BitcoinTalk, acted aggressively towards criticism and spread false information (probably because of lack of knowledge) about SEPA-payments and a Norwegian competitor's (Sturle's Bitmynt) prices.

You are right, but the fines Ripple Labs have received from FINCEN are related to their status as an MSB, not the protocol itself. The protocol won't change, Ripple Labs only seem to be updating their tools for monitoring transactions across the network on the requirement of FINCEN.

They might have saved their backs regarding chargebacks by requiring all users to use 2FA by default (either by SMS or Google Authenticator). By requiring 2FA, Circle can firmly establish that a user has been logged in and that a purchase of BTC via credit/debit card must have been authorised because the user was logged in via 2FA. If not, it was most likely the user's fault anyways for losing/getting their 2FA-unit stolen.
So, in a legal case or settlement case, Circle could potentially provide proof that the user was indeed logged in and made the purchase themselves.
DISCLAIMER: I do not know if the above has any legal significance at all.

I think your point about fundamentals is really important to consider because everyone values them differently. It might seem like tons of merchants and new services related to Bitcoin are popping up every day, but how large of a portion of those services are actually utilised instead of just being hyped? We might have increased the merchant adoption significantly, ATMs are popping up around the world and talks/conferences/meetups are being had, but how many are actually using Bitcoin? 
If you are inside the 'circle' where Bitcoin-users mingle the situation is always tinted by our rose glasses, while as the situation looks quite different when the rose glass tint disappears.

I don't really think this is what is happening because what people think of when they hear Bitcoin is: "Some nerds got rich by buying early", "It looks and sounds like a scam so it must be a scam" and "Selifsh nerds that want the price to rise to get rich". Heck, I don't even think most people *know* it is a payment system. What they know is the Silk Road, money laundering (not true I know), heists, MtGox imploding and early adopters cashing out. 
On the other hand, when the public hears Dogecoin it's more like this: "Oh, it's the guys that helped that Jamaican bobsled team to the Olympics", "I heard they are funding clean water in Kenya and Zimbabwe" and "they even have a race car called the DogeCar". They don't have any of the negative connotations compared to Bitcoin.

No suggestion to change the Wikipedia article was made and nor do I believe that is meaningful to do (at least this one aspect of the article). 
However, if a topic is contested and includes several contrasting views it might be wise to include part of that discussion on Wikipedia so that readers can be given some background for the disagreement. For example, for Bitcoin a discussion incorporating differing and contrasting views on the currency-aspect would be interesting to include. 
EDIT: checked the Wikipedia article and there is already a bit of this discussion incorporated into one of the sections.

I think there is a pretty big difference between the whole Pierce-scandal and PayCoin, PayBase and Garza. For Pierce no evidence of wrongdoing existed and the accuser was known to lie and make false accusations to ruin lives. For PayCoin, PayBase and Garza there is a papertrail of evidence that indicates scam, ponzi scheme and a blatant lack of security. Some evidence or strong indicators of this are the back-pedalling of unrealistic promises of grandeur (working with large retailers, $20 price floor) as well as the lack of innovation (i.e. copying Peercoin directly) despite their claims to the contrary. 
I understand you are attempting to remain neutral and go by "innocent until proven guilty", but as you said yourself you have done no research on PayCoin, PayBase and Garza (which I find very surprising) and hence your opinion carries very little weight.

Really? Gravity is universally true. Contracts vary in their formal nature and there is no one 'template' that says that every contract has to contain this and that and enforce this and that. Contracts are social constructs that social beings choose to follow or not follow. Not following a contract might have consequences, but that stops no one from breaching it. The very fact that they are social constructs make them absolutely non-universal. 


If you'd taken a look you'd see he hasn't answered anyone in this thread for at least 11 hours. 


No will do. Why? Because different universities have differing policies. Additionally, as said above, even if the course catalogue is a contract between students and the university it is a social construct anyone can breach at any time. In order to decide if the modules on Bitcoin are optional we need an answer from OP on how plausible it is that he will violate the "contract".

It's been reversed because it is wrong and inaccurate. There is no evidence to support a $296 million transaction volume across the Bitcoin-network last Black Friday (look at the [charts of transaction volume in USD]( there's no $296m peak in November). The only way one can reasonbly claim this is by intentionally misrepresenting the worldwide trade volume of Bitcoin (i.e. trade on exchanges) together with transaction volume as transaction/spending of Bitcoin (take a look at BitcoinWisdom now and you will see a combined trade volume across all exchanges and currencies edging towards 200,000 BTC, which is not even close). It is simply make-belief wishful thinking that Bitcoin is big (which it currently isn't).

If it ever happens, it will be without consensus, no doubt about it. Hence, altcoin. 
Do/did you say the same about BU too? XT? Classic? I can quite clearly remember you arguing around the XT and Classic time that any hard fork initiated by them (when the 75% threshold was reached and grace period passed) would be termed an altcoin.

You're right, sorry about that. 


A coin vote, but that is not an indication of whether the economic majority agrees or agreed to the hard fork. The economic majority in terms of exchanges, businesses working on projects, full nodes and the like clearly supported the hard fork by upgrading to the software that included options for it. The developer community also supported the hard fork in the widest possible sense. 


The vast majority can be happy and still ETC would have value. I am also not sure where you are getting the idea that ETC is thriving from, as good as no projects are built using it. If you are referring to the price, that is no an indication of something thriving - that is just speculative.

But, isn't the reason these chains do not get orphaned because they are not the same chain? In my understanding what we have after a hard fork is two seperate chains, A and B. Correct, no? Surely, if the economic majority is on one chain the miners and the rest will switch over? 


Can you explain the errors you say the article is riddled with? Are there are rebukes available of this particular piece and Hearn's understanding of hard and soft forks? 
When you are writing "soft forks can be set up such that unupgraded nodes do not recognize upgraded blocks (which is the hard fork behaviour)" do you mean that unupgraded notes ignore and do not relay upgraded blocks? 


Again, won't any unupgraded hard forked node be on a different chain? So, what you will be attacking is a minority chain of little importance and value.

I'm not saying that these companies will do a crappy job, I am saying that they will compete to lower costs and most drug manufacturers' will go for the cheapest available option. 
It takes time for a company or label to build a reputation, be it negative or positive. In the mean time when the free market works out what competitor is the best, people will get sick, people will die, and people will not get the drugs they need.

For all intents and purposes and for 99% users, SEPA- and SWIFT-transactions are also irreversible. Reversibility is not such a huge issue as many here think. 


Except when, you know, your transaction does not get confirmed for 12 hours because of higher-than-normal block times? Like, right now. Also, the cost is not fixed - it is increasing. Fees to use Bitcoin have climbed a lot over the past year and will continue to climb until capacity is increased.

No economist in the real world follows or adheres to Austrian economics. Whatever Von Mises noted about inflation really does not matter to or change what economists refer to when they say "inflation". They refer to "price inflation", period. 
He's also wrong, expansion of the monetary supply does not always lead to inflation (it's rather a response to it), is not the "root cause" of prices rising and it is *not* inflation on its own. He's just plain wrong and decades of research and economic work, empirical evidence and research has shown him wrong time and time again.

I am not sure, because I don't understand what is meant by "anti-consensus". Is it the opposite of consensus (i.e. Bitcoin-nodes to be in agreement about what constitutes Bitcoin or to follow the same rules for validation), or what is it? If it is the opposite of consensus, then it doesn't make sense to speak of it in terms of individual clients or accusing alternative implementations of being "anti-consensus" because they are in agreement with all other Bitcoin-nodes. 
Yes, they may trigger a fork sometime in the future. However, that only happens if a supermajority of Bitcoin-nodes agree to it and by then that will be the *defacto* consensus of the Bitcoin-network. You may disagree with the consensus the network arrived at, but that's a completely different thing and has nothing to do with the emergent consensus in the Bitcoin-network. 


I am not sure what you are trying to say here? Sure, the 21M coin limit would be a huge change and as you say it would not be supported. That's because we use Bitcoin because of that limit, because of its promises to deflate, to have a different economic model. It's a fundamental aspect of Bitcoin in that sense. But, to talk about it, write software and promote it or the idea of it - how can that be anti-consensus? It's not like it would gain much traction, right? And even if it did and we hard forked to have 42M coins instead, that would be the *defacto* consensus of the Bitcoin-network. Again, you may disagree with the emergent consensus but the 42M coins version would be Bitcoin.
So, bottom line: Bitcoin is whatever the Bitcoin-network comes to consensus about what it is. If they wanted to change the block header to always include the number "42" on top, we could do that and it would still be Bitcoin.

How does bullshit like this get published, circulated and upvoted at all? 
The author of this article did ***zero*** research on this, as usual from Cointelegraph. First, [DNB prohibits buying and selling of Bitcoin in their TOS]( The relevant section is "6.4 Retmessig bruk" ("6.4 Allowed usage"). Search for "Bitcoin" on the page and you will see this:




 
Second, what Bitcoins Norway has done is to open a merchant account with Vipps. This is in absolutely no way signalling that DNB or Vipps endorses Bitcoin, is interested in simplifying its use or anything that at all. All it means is that DNB has a really shitty procedure for clients to sign up for merchant accounts that doesn't even check if the merchant signing up is involved with Bitcoin or is breaking Vipps TOS. 
Third, Bitcoins Norway is scummy and scummy as fuck and has had numerous problems with their platform. The run-down is that they have neglected upgrading essential features and blamed users for errors in their platform and its operations. Withdrawals and deposits are really slow as well. They have also ignored reports of a serious security vulnerability in which session cookies were possible to hijack (I had the white hat hacker confirm this with my own account there) and break into accounts. The white hat hacker also confirmed to me that he was able to break into the adminstrator accounts of the owners and proprietors of Bitcoins Norway. They never told told the public about this and when they took the platform down to fix this they conveniently signalled it as "maintenance". Additionally, I have been threatened by their owner to be sued for defamation for calling the owners and their team technically incapable on That, of course, never happened and I never received any letter from their lawyers.
To the author of the above article, you are a disgrace.
I also don't understand how the fuck this article got published and not corrected by the author when there is clear evidence that it is not the case that DNB or Vipss endorses or even allows Bitcoin-purchases and this was pointed out in the other thread about this:

That's true. By tomorrow (at least my time), 2nd of December it will have been 14 days (2016 block equivalent if the average block-time is 10 minutes for this period) since Segwit signalling started.
I guess keeping track of block height is more reliable. Segwit signalling started at block 439,488, so at block 441,504 the 2016 block interval will have been crossed. Will be interesting to see how far the percentage of blocks signalling for Segwit has climbed by then.

OK, bad formulation by me. Sorry about that. What I meant to say is that if the inflation rate or properties of a monetary unit cannot be changed (i.e. there is absolutely no avenue to change it) by the masses (i.e. by democratic means), it is by definition centrally planned.

Correction: they were afraid of *pure democracy*. Democracy includes more than just voting, it is a system of checks and balances between different institutions, such as courts, parliaments, media, etc. 


I agree, individual elections for each state makes some sense. Regarding North Dakota or Montana, the same problems exists today too with gerrymandering and ridiculous election laws state-to-state. That's why you have swing states that literally and technically decide the election. Take a look at these videos:
* 
* 
If you have access to it (or you can find it as a torrent), watch that election special of Adam Ruins Everything - it has a pretty good rundown of what's wrong. 


Agreed, that would also close the loopholes in certain states which allows electors to vote for whomever they like. It would still give disproportional voting power to smaller and less relevant states, which may be problematic. Not letting them having their voice heard is also a problem, so the two have to be balanced. 


In some ways, yes. In other ways, absolutely not. I don't think EU member states pool referendums and local votes together in the presidential or EU elections like what happens in the US. Those are done separately and most often decided on a local level in city, municipality and regional elections.

By that definition the current alternative implementations do not fall under it. They only activate forks if a supermajority agrees. Also, your definition is just a general description of what any fork does, soft or hard.

Independent to what? What's the purpose of the tool? Your pint analogy seems wrong and fallacious to me. 1 USD is 1 USD no matter what, same as 1 pint is 1 pint no matter what. Inflating the monetary supply only changes what 1 USD can buy, not the monetary unit itself.
Milton Friedman is wrong about inflation, increase in the monetary supply is just one cause (and not a common one either) of inflation and most of the time it is actually a response to inflation happening because of other reasons.

I would dare say that this is very different and the chance of a fork gaining momentum is nil. The reason the DAO fork was supported is that so many were affected by it, and so much money was at stake. Furthermore, the DAO was a buggy hellish monster of a crowdsale so it was warranted in many's minds to fork it away.
In this case, one large whale got hacked so it is *very* different in my opinion.

Then, how exactly is BitcoinXT an altcoin *right now*? It uses, and will use, the **current** Bitcoin blockchain until 75% of miners support BitcoinXT patches. If it does not reach 75% miner support, nothing changes at all. It's nonsense and lies that BitcoinXT is an altcoin, it's simply a different implementation of the same principles.

So, what would you prefer or suggest? Does everyone have to agree to update? 
The last hard fork you're talking about, was that P2SH? From what I've read in comments on here there was opposition, a portion of miners even put "NOP2SH" in their blocks to voice their opposition. Eventually they updated to clients supporting P2SH though.

What's the difference? If it does "break" the consensus rules with 75% of miner support, the consensus rules have been de facto changed to what the majority of the network wants. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:10:40


We can always aim for 100%, but you know just as well as me it is impossible to achieve (ever seen an election in a country where a party received 100% of the votes, except North Korea?). Everyone does not agree to the increased block size, just as everyone didn't agree to P2SH. Still, everyone followed (after a while) when the majority upgraded to support P2SH. 


You claim this is not how it works, can you explain why this is true? In a scenario where the network would require 100% of all miners to upgrade to larger blocks, an infinitely small miner could prevent this by not upgrading to larger blocks. That miner then essentially prevents everyone else (a near absolute majority) to switch to larger blocks. Why shouldn't this one miner create his own altcoin with his preferred block size? Why should we let the tiniest disagreement hinder progress?


This could just as well be an argument for supporting raising the block size. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:40:27
Uh, what have you misunderstood about BitcoinXT? It follows the current consensus rules, but in case of a fork, which happens only, and only, if 75% of miners use BitcoinXT (or other clients that support larger blocks) then it forks. If there's not enough support for the larger blocks it doesn't fork, simple as that.

I am not sure if I understand your point. Do you mean that the user will transfer the rest of their funds to the other party of the LN-channel to close it and "get rid" of the volatile asset? If so, what if the user does not want the service or good they opened the LN-channel for and instead want fiat or an altcoin?


Your estimate of how long channels will stay open (8 to 14 months or every two weeks) is where the problem lies. Are users supposed to lock significant amounts of their funds for such a long period of time in LN? There are numerous problems with this (which the article addresses), for example people receiving their paycheques about twice a month or even only once a month. How will these users utilise LN-channels, and for what? 
Another problem is that if users are to only open and close LN-channels every 8 to 14 months (or every two weeks), we will likely see settlement houses to develop that connect to many merchants and let you use one LN-channel for many merchants and services. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it ultimately leads to LN-channels centralising around a small number of settlement houses that connect to a multitude of merchants, services and individuals. 
A third problem I can think of is that businesses will have problems with their cash flow since LN-channels have to be closed in order for them to receive money for a good or service. They might have to wait for weeks and months to receive it (since the LN-channels can stay open for long) and opening a LN-channel does not carry any promise of funds coming through. In this way, it seems less reliable than credit and debit cards (not in terms of security, of course, but in terms of promise to deliver the cash). With credit and debit cards there is a promise that when a payment is made, the money arrives when the transaction is settled days or weeks later. With LN there is no such promise, as users don't have to transfer the full amount locked in the LN-channel.

People disagreeing is not data. Where is their data and analysis? The Toomim-brothers actually carried out data collection and analysis of block propagation times around the world (including behind the Great Chinese Firewall) and found that it did not affect block propagation significantly. They also talked to a number of significant miners, including the Chinese, that all agreed that 2MB would not hurt decentralisation or their operations for that matter.

They ignore non-valid blocks unless they upgrade to a new version that changes what is valid. If full nodes upgrade to a new version with new rules for what is considered valid Bitcoin-blocks, that becomes Bitcoin. No one is delusional, and this is a rather insulting thing to throw around. Just as you, supporters of a hard fork are aware that full nodes ignore miners that produce invalid, non-Bitcoin blocks and understand that one needs the support of full nodes and the economic majority to carry through with a hard fork. 


The remaining 25% does not have to abandon Bitcoin, but they will be vulnerable to attack, have a sluggish currency (way higher confirmation times for a while, lower rewards for miners because of a price decline) and lose significant value because the majority of the Bitcoin-economy has shifted away. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 17:22:12




The point is that in times of volatility many users may close their LN channels at the same time, leading to delays in settlement (i.e. the time for the settlement transaction to confirm) and hence instability in the LN-network. The problem is not volatility per say, but that it may cause instability and massive closure of LN-channels because users want to trade their assets for a less volatile instrument (be it fiat or altcoins).

But this is dependent on the party you have opened the LN-channel with, right? Or have I misunderstood something about the LN? Can you switch receiver to someone else within the LN-network? For example, I open a LN-channel with you, but then I realise I need to also pay someone else. Can I then open a new LN-channel with the same funds without closing the LN-channel I have opened to you? 


I understand that it cannot be rolled back, but that is not what I am talking about. I am referring to how funds are locked up in the LN-channel between two parties until it is closed, and how that poses problems to the cash flow and guarantee of receiving funds to a merchant or service provider. Again, have I misunderstood something with LN? Are parties able to instantly re-spend funds used to open LN-channels to other transactions or to open LN-channels with another party or traverse across other channels in the network? Aren't the funds locked in a multi-signature address between those two parties?

Implementations of Thin Blocks are already implemented and in active development (here is one called [Xtreme Thinblocks]( currently a BUIP (Bitcoin Unlimited Improvement Proposal)). Lightning Network is not a real scaling solution as it only allows for scaling in a clunky way in which every user has to lock up their money using complex scripts for use in payment channels. This is hardly a viable solution for scaling, in my opinion. 


One problem with SegWit is that it is being implemented as a soft fork, leaving non-upgraded nodes in the dark about the new transaction data structure. Another problem, as I see it, is that it only provides an increase in scalability or possible transaction throughput if, and only if, a large portion of the network starts using complex scripts (nLockTimeVerify, P2SH, etc.) as well as implement SegWith in their software. If deployed as a soft fork we will see lower increases in scalability than if it is deployed as a hard fork. However, Core developers seem extremely vary of implementing it as a hard fork for various reasons. My feeling is that they do not want to deploy it as a hard fork because they know it would not be able to gain consensus in the developer community and not among the economic majority and miners. 
EDIT: for those downvoting me - it would be great to receive some explanation for why. Is there something incorrect in my comment? Please point it out, I would like to know so I can improve my understanding!

Block size is not a fundamental property and never has been. It was implemented as an anti-spam, anti-DOS mechanism back in Bitcoin's early days. Fundamental properties are immutability, direct control and decentralisation. Minority control and blockade of upgrades is not a fundamental property, rather the opposite. If you believe the opinions of the economic majority and miners can be easily swayed by populist rhetorics you are mistakenly assuming the participants in Bitcoin are stupid. Climb down from your high, golden-clad pedestal and stop assuming everyone else is stupid and easily swayed by "populist rhetoric" and that only you, and other opponents of a hardfork to 2MB, gets to define what the fundamental properties and uses of Bitcoin are. 


You are aware that slippery slope is a fallacy, not an argument?


Consensus principles don't matter jack shit unless the economic majority supports your fork. It will lose value, be open to attacks and quickly die off. Unless you change the POW-algorithm, then things might get interesting. However, then it arguably isn't Bitcoin anymore.

Thanks for taking the time to explain this, it deepened my understanding of LN!


This is problematic if you ask me, as it incentives users to keep large sums of money on the LN-network. It is also problematic if you look at the time frames, 8-14 months and once a month, you considered for opening and closing LN-channels. What if users wants to top up their LN-channels between these periods of time? What if they miscalculated, when opening a LN-channel at first, how much they will spend over the month or the 8-14 months? They would then have to refund the channel, or open a new one, by sending a new transaction, which strains the network. To me at least, LN does not seem like a forgiving or flexible system in this aspect.

By this definition of a contentious hard fork I (running a full node and holding bitcoins) and a miner friend can refuse to abandon the old currency and keep trading it on the free market, and the fork will be called contentious. 


No, it cannot be viewed as an altcoin, and it will always follow the longest chain of valid Bitcoin-blocks. If Classic reaches the 75% hashing power threshold, has the support of the economic majority and passes the grace period of 28 days, it is Bitcoin and will be following the longest chain of valid Bitcoin-blocks according to the majority of miners and full nodes. It is nonsensical to call a proposed hard fork that activates only with a supermajority and can be rejected at any time by miners and the economic majority an altcoin.

That is because the understanding that consensus rules can ***only*** be changed with &gt;=95% support is wrong. A majority of miners (&gt;51%) can change the rules via a hardfork if they have the support of the economic majority (full nodes, exchanges, businesses) to enforce such a change. This has always been the case since the genesis block of Bitcoin and always will be the case. 
The economic majority gives Bitcoin value and without their support and willingness to exchange mined bitcoins for anything else valueable or useful, bitcoins has no value. 
There is no coup if the economic majority as well as the majority of miners support it. This notion of a coup is silly, disingenious and inaccurate.

This depends on how you construct the algorithm that calculates the flexible cap. It can be very conservative (only small changes possible), or it can be mid-size changes or large changes. It is not true that there is no limit with a flexible cap, it just changes after a set period of time (for example every 1000 blocks). 


It is not true that a no limits solution is a total no-go. In fact, absent a max block size cap the market will reach an equilibrium block size. See this paper by @_date: 2017-04-26 11:44:41

My point is that if somebody has to spend 1-2 days informing themselves how to properly protect their funds, then it is a barrier to Bitcoin-adoption (and your "scenario where bitcoin is used as the main form of payment").

Bitcoin - the network - is literally and technically a democracy. By accepting or rejecting blocks and transactions, Bitcoin full-nodes are effectively voting on what Bitcoin is.
The major developer groups are not democratic, non-inclusive and not necessarily welcoming to newcomers (they are a clique). Some see that as a problem, some do not. It's up for discussion. 
Either way, I think it is important to distinguish between the different aspects of Bitcoin when discussing this (i.e. network-level, developer group-level, etc.) because it brings much-needed clarity and nuance to the discussion.

You're mixing up two concepts; developer consensus to implement a change (not present for RBF) and the consensus mechanism of Bitcoin. The former is the problem here because it is not present, and yet the change is being merged.

I see where you are going with this, the whole "taxation is theft-logic. Most people don't believe in that kind of logic. Anyways, we do not know if SEED is financed by taxes or money that the Danish government has obtained in other ways (f.ex. profits on a government company).

You're incredibly out of touch with reality if you actually believe this.

"Retarget" is a fitting choice of words.

Not everyone generalises, and you are just an asshole. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:41:48
True, but I'm not hopeful it will happen.

Nothing on the sampling strategy other than that they:


Unless we know something about their sampling strategies, the sample itself and who the survey respondents are this is absolutely useless.

Didn't expect the fee would be that large. $1.36 is a lot for a Bitcoin-transaction.

If the supposed *currency of the Internet* and/or *currency of the future* cannot compete on price or convenience with traditional wire transfers, it has utterly failed.

From the looks of their webpage, they have removed the information regarding how to buy XBT from Norway. Earlier they had a section regarding Norway on their ["Payment Methods"-page]( stating that they support bank transfers and SEPA (it looked exactly like the Danish one, except the flag of course).

Many of these announcements of support for UASF are plays for exposure, nothing more. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 17:39:59
Why not link directly to their donation page?

The withdrawn funds were indeed very real, not just IOUs. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 23:00:39
Hopefully you remember to do it yourself as well...!

And this has what to do with Bitcoin? Absolutely nothing.
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:17:50


That's a huge if, and everything points towards the status quo continuing or BIP148 UASF resulting in something worse. 


Why? What, if anything else than speculation, is there that will see Bitcoin rise 10 or 100 times?

So, it isn't even using Bitcoin. Great.
