This is complete BS. On and on about futures settlement.
Someone who was short the futures and wanted to remain short would have rolled into the new contract.

Happy trading. I typed a long reply to this but then thought what’s the point. 
I’m done.

I’m saying the future expiry doesn’t have a damn effect. If someone was short (as you say from the top all the way down 50%) they don’t have to wait for the fucking expiry date to close their position.  If someone started their short position just last week and wanted to remain short, just because the current month contract is was expiring today they don’t have to go flat because of that. They can roll into the newer month contract.

Bitcoin is global. In many countries (e.g. UK, Hong Kong, India, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, South Africa) fiscal year is not the calendar year.

Yes that too, he missed out and is bitter. Dude has been proven wrong again and again and instead of backing down is upping his bet of doom. Also I have seen some of these naysayers insinuate that whomever expert is favouring bitcoin must do so because they’re invested and so wants the price to go up. In the last such senate hearing a few months back there was some economist who talked well of bitcoin. The next ‘expert’ to talk, sitting next to him, started by saying “well let me say at the outset that I am not invested in bitcoin or any other crypto ..” with a smile, implying that the guy before him must have been invested otherwise he wouldn’t have been positive on it.

I wouldn’t say he had any reputation. He just wants to be considered relevant again. He had 15 mins of fame courtesy of saying for years before 2008 that a crisis was likely. Now people say oh nouriel predicted the crisis. He didn’t have any skin in the game, didn’t manage money for people out of his supposed prophetic vision ahead of the crisis. He was simply calling for doom for a long while. A broken clock is correct twice a day. I don’t know why Congress took him and not any of much more informed people. The guy was mocking bitcoin from as far back as I can remember him opening his mouth on the topic.

Respect. A cool informed head to counter the clown whose agenda is nothing but appealing to authority.

The longer and deeper the bear market gets the longer and vaguer the time period of price predictions from these gurus become (“in the next 5 to 10 years something it’s possible we’ll hit $250k”..”next 2 to 5 yrs will be interesting”)

If bitcoin reaches $100,000 will $100,000 have the same value as today???
