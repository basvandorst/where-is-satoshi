Hard to tell. Though this site looks at the distribution of btc by address counts -

Maybe, incentivise the customer to dispose of the trash in a bin in the first place, by enabling a one time only micropayment that is released when the wrapper is placed in a bin. Could use a unique QR code of chip.

I wonder if you would be restricted for sending btc to Augur, once it comes on line.

This data was captured over time from 
I could not believe there is over 51 million addresses with less than 0.001 BTC. How and why are these being created?

I would love to see a totally decentralised Fantasy Sports application - that runs off a Bitcoin sidechain or Ethereum.
In a similar vein to prediction market 
I suppose the problem with this approach would be buildin an Oracle system that grabs the sports statistic from somewhere.
After the recent insider trading at Fan dual - can anyone really trust a centralise fantasy sports company.
