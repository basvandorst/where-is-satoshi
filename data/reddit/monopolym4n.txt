So now you have volatile BTC sitting an anonymous wallet and can't convert it to cash without being exposed. What good does this serve? 
@_date: 2014-02-07 16:30:06
So to get this straight, a bitcoin exchange named The Magic Gathering Online eXchange that has caused problems with withdrawals both to bitcoin/fiat now for several months, has crashed the price of bitcoin several times because their algorithm couldn't handle a sell order, proven to not be worthy of a professional institution managing millions of dollars, is under investigation by federal authorities and restricted to a gag order due to related silk road matters not only had almost 40,000 coins stuck in limbo for several weeks but had the balls to cancel all those withdrawals, returning the coins back to the users wallets and THEN cancelling all bitcoin withdrawals out of the site. 
Of course the latter of those events were unforeseen and greatly unexpected, but the thing that makes me sick is that you fools were still trusting this place with your money and bitcoins, this is making the whole community suffer due to your ignorance. You should have been out of The Magic Gathering Online Exchange back when they proved they were not a professional organization months ago and you know it. Your mere greediness to capture a large premium on your coins has cost you and the community greatly. 
Q14. How do you explain the vastly different prices that appear on Gox compared with other exchanges? It recently went to 25%.
• Some traders were responsible for the manufacturing the differential in an attempt to financially benefit from arbitrage.
I would not be surprised if the traders he is mentioning is in fact the two gox employees making these statements. It appears as if the premium on gox has vanished, now the question is what are all those customers going to do with a worthless dollar amount in their accounts at an exchange that is going under.
I applaud you for bringing this matter to the community, but as I said earlier everyone in the community should have been out of gox a long time ago and now we all must suffer for the side of ignorance and greed.

Mtgox is rumored under a gag order from the FBI, this is not going to help resolve the issues with gox. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 16:17:40
I can't expand on a rumor I can't confirm.. Don't you think it is suspicious that the whole lack of money transmitter license seizure excuse months back was later stated by the Justice department saying the seizure of funds was related to the silk road? 
Surely the FBI is running an investigation within MtGox and has ordered them not to comment on anything.

@_date: 2014-02-19 15:45:25
I honestly read that whole thing and must have blacked out half way because I don't understand how it took so long just to say bitcoin's network protocol changed the world and you want to be a part of it. Two ways you can help Bitcoin; spend it and never use Mt. Gox again but we are way past the turning point for the latter of those two, that's all you have to do.

The two aren't even comparable... the logical reasoning of this sub reddit is not where it should be to support a movement of bitcoin's size. This is my only worry for bitcoin, not government intervention.  
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:01:05
Clearly finding "the creator of bitcoin" did not impact the price to increase, we have seen wallets with hundreds of thousands of coins get moved before without a market impact. No one is going to dump that many coins on a market it will go to private buyers like SecondMarket. Just because your friends want to spend a couple hundred to gamble with BTC is not going to impact the price in the short term.

I always find it interesting how a bank can overdraft your account with their own fees. They know you don't have the money, they just don't care. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 20:27:59
Everything you explained doesn't seemed viable for the very reason posted in the article. Bitcoin is not anonymous. It used to be anonymous when you could use bitinstant to purchase bitcoins with no one checking your ID, those days are gone and so is the so called "anonymous" nature of bitcoin. All it would take for Chinese officials is to monitor purchases of more than a certain amount of bitcoins, say 800. If anything is purchased for greater than 800 BTC you must state how the funds were acquired, much like a bank will report any deposit greater than $10,000 to the IRS. Also given the Chinese government's stance on BTC anyone found using BTC would surely raise red flags. This argument does not seem well thought out to rely to BTC. This could apply to a newer crypto in its early stages with true anonymous nature like ZeroCoin or DarkCoin, not the user friendly widely open and criticized BTC; it would be too risky to conduct this kind of operation in BTC. The only argument you could make with this is that corrupted Chinese people have ALREADY moved their money out of the country in Nov/Dec and that is the reason we had a 10x fold increase in these months.

and then the DOJ came out and stated it was related to the silkroad, this is known information I am not talking out my 'backside' 
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:40:44
They seized that account in connection with the silk road and stated it was for 'not having a money transmitting license'

OH COOL, MT.GOX FAILED AND LOST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. LETS TRY OUT GOX AND SEE IF HE CAN RECOUP THE MONEY?
NO WONDER THE US GOVERNMENT ISN'T REGULATING BITCOIN, WHY REGULATE SOMETHING THAT IS JUST GOING TO IMPLODE ON ITSELF AS IT IS LEAD BY IDIOTS?

What is mt. gox?
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:59:53
why does that require them to be cooperating? For all they know this is just another user and his bitcoins. No one knows who stole the coins and even if we did is an exchange going to blacklist all known acquaintances of the thief?
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:58:01
Even with a $50.00 drop its still overbought, its still early and foolish to buy into an overbought market regardless of the news coming out.

It is actually quite comical that gox was capable of generating hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue per day and yet all we see are people flaming how badly structured the code was. If Mark had any intention of keeping gox alive don't you think he would have some common sense to reinvest back into the company? My guess is you all played right into Mark's hand and made him very wealthy. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 20:41:21
What are you talking about? They didn't seize the coins for failure to comply with money transmitting laws they seized the coins in connection with the silk road. They only told the public it was for not having a money transmitting license to not raise suspicion.

Placing emphasis on a countries ability to impact a virtual currency market based on their economic factors holds no water in my book. You are using conventional economic terms to value a countries impact on a completely non conventional currency/commodity. India is a major contributor to technology innovations and the country is dependent on technology innovation for survival. Look at how many jobs the IT/technology sector has created in India. To a virtual currency, what good is 68% of the population earning less than $2.00 per day? None, that is your answer so why even factor these into your bullet point "analysis". While a majority of the country may be poor, the rising middle technologically advanced class is what will drive bitcoin adoption along with the opportunities that bitcoin brings. 
India will prove to be a major impact to virutal currencies as will South Korea. Do not measure their impact in terms of China as this is unreasonable.. No one will do what China did to bitcoin, and look what it has done; virtually created and nearly popped the bubble that it alone created.

Bitstamp is where the money is at...and by money I mean money that will be wired to your account. Why have funds in GOX if you can't withdraw your funds?
There is a reason mtgox used to do over 80% of bitcoin volume and now is down to hopefully less than 20% after today.
