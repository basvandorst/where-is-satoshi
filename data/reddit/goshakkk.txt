I don't think it would be possible to build this completely on the blockchain. An alternative would be to have this application run on some server, but then, well, there still would be someone pulling the strings. (Or worse, their server would run a modified version of that application, and there would be no way to tell whether it has or has not been modified by the hoster.)
Another alternative would be this: what if there was a way to run an open-source application in such a way that it's completely decentralized? When *the platform* that runs it reveals its source code for anyone to inspect?
Well, that's precisely what **Ethereum** [[1]] [[2]] is. It's both like and unlike Bitcoin at the same time. The similarity is that both have some kind of unit of value and allow transfers of those and that both have a blockchain. The difference is that Ethereum isn't limited to bare value transfers — Ethereum is a platform for smart contracts. It has a Turing-complete powerful scripting language that allows for, well, many different things.
(It's not a finished software, it's still in active development (PoC available though), but the prospects it opens are exciting.) [[3]]
You can program a wide range of applications to be run on Ethereum network: be it a DAO [[4]], a sub-coin [[5]], an escrow account, or any other kind of smart contract.
Now, the Ethereum team itself won't, probably, release a first stable in a month, but long-term, Ethereum is quite perspective technology.
Your best bet would be to support Ethereum development and fund development of a DAO contract on top of it.
(Not affiliated with Ethereum in any way, just sharing why it could be *the* platform for BTCF DAO.)

No. Meklebar is simply a JS wrapper around raw Bitcoin transactions and is intended for the end user usage.
Various applications may implement functionality like this using just Bitcoin protocol. It's simple.
I have a different idea though. For example, Meklebar might allow you to create some sort of "payment request" with mediator and receiver pre-filled. The user would click the link, paste their private key and complete the tx. Not every wallet app supports a simple bitcoin:// scheme, let alone creating of escrow transactions with data pre-filled (or escrow transactions at all). This feature might simplify the process for the buyers &amp; sellers on different marketplaces.

I think it might be achieved using bitcoin:// urls ([BIP 0021]( and/or QR codes with these urls encoded.
I am not entirely sure it can be done currently, but ideally there should be a way to add more than one output + a custom script. This way no third party like a hosted walled would be involved.

Because literally none wallet application allows creating of a transaction with a custom output script. That's the whole point.


It doesn't send to any address, to be precise. It, basically, throws the coins in the void and says "thou who has 2 signatures (out of 3) may spend the coins".


No, not really. There are no multisig addresses or redeemScripts involved. All you need to do is create a redeeming transaction and sign the input with X out of Y private keys. (This can be done manually, without Meklebar — Meklebar is just there to simplify it.)
You may just fork/download the sources — they are on GitHub — if you are afraid the site will go down.

The full-featured Blockchain app isn't available on the App Store — meaning you have to jailbreak your device or, if you have a dev account, compile the app yourself in order to use it. It's barely a good option for the most people.
So far, I am aware of only two wallets that have approved iOS apps — [Coinbase]( and [CoinJar]( Though you have to trust them, as the private keys for your addresses on both are not available to you.

I have just [updated]( the explanation to address some of your concerns. What do you think? 
@_date: 2013-10-20 16:31:15
Yeah, I suspected my explanation is not the best, but I didn't know what specifically might be hard to understand. Thanks for pointing out.


Yep, the buyer.


It is the most desired case, but it might be the buyer who receives their money back as well, hence a different name.


Yes, from the buyer. The buyer sees it after completing the transaction.


Again, it might be the buyer who will get their money back. Though yeah, by default it should probably pre-fill the receiver address from the transaction.


When you visit "Redeem" and enter both transaction ID and receiving wallet, the special code will be generated below.


Each scenario is pretty same, basically. To redeem the coins you need a signature of one of the other two parties...
For example, if:
1. buyer &amp; merchant agree — the merchant visits "Redeem" page, pastes transaction ID and their address, and asks the buyer to approve redemption (by giving them a special code and asking them to visit the "Approve" page), pastes their signature &amp; own private key
2. buyer &amp; mediator agree — the buyer visits "Redeem" page, pastes tx ID &amp; their address, hands the code to the mediator, pastes their signature &amp; own private key
3. merchant &amp; mediator agree — the merchant visits "Redeem" page, pastes tx ID &amp; their address, hands the code to the mediator, pastes their signature &amp; own private key


The very essence of escrow transactions is that, once sent, the coins are kind of locked up in such a way that you need 2 parties to agree in order to spend them... so if the receiver wishes to get the coins, they need to signs the transaction themselves *and* ask buyer/mediator to sign it as well.
Thanks, once again, for the feedback on explanation. I'd like to improve it and make simpler for the common man to understand.

Interested. Thank you.

Go to "Import/Export" tab, select "Export Unencrypted" from the sidebar and here you go. Locate the address you want the private key from and copy the "priv" value. You can switch between different private key formats on the top.

A chance of generating the same address exists regardless of whether you generate it offline or online, however, the odds of that happening are rather super-duper-small to be even considered. There can be 2^160 addresses, or, to put it into more context, there can be [215,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 addresses **per capita**](

You could give [btcQuick]( a try. Their verification process seems pretty straightforward — you just have to upload a photo ID (+ pay $1.99 for verification) and then you can buy BTC using your credit card (with a 5.5% fee). Never used it myself though.
If [LiqPay]( works in your area, you could buy BTC using a credit card *without any* verification via [BTC-E]( (used this one multiple times).
Refer to [this page]( on Bitcoin wiki if none of the above works for you.
