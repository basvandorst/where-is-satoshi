What data the government can have.

I'm not disagreeing but where do you draw the line?

Thank you!  That's makes perfect sense.  I think going to war with Iran will be tough though if Russia decides to back them.

Thank you!  I appreciate your explanation and have a better understanding now.

Somebody eli5 why it matters what currency oil is traded in?  Couldn't we just convert US dollars to euros to make purchases?
@_date: 2017-02-16 04:22:02
That was so 2052.

Are there any advantages to the nano ledger s vs keeping a few strategically placed paper wallets?

Can you do it with bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-05-23 18:05:53
Would this help with online orders or replace escrow?

Thanks for the kind words.  I really want to get more into bitcoin and am intrigued that some have fully converted away from Fiat.  
@_date: 2016-07-16 21:41:16
That's awesome!  Do alot of stores around you take bitcoin or do you have to convert it before spending?  Do you still invest in retirement accounts such as 401k or ira)?  Thanks for your input!
@_date: 2016-07-13 18:03:22
I see what you mean
@_date: 2016-07-13 14:47:16
From a security perspective it's better to have your coins in cold storage but for comparison a bitcoin etf seems a little more safe than a single circle wallet.

Nice job so far!

Hey, I'm still relatively new to cyrptocurrencies and recently began investing.  The idea of putting "all my eggs" in the bitcoin basket still scares me though.  What motivated you to put your paycheck into btc?  Do you ever worry of the value plummeting and losing your savings?  
Edit: wow down voted for asking questions...what a welcoming subreddit....

Thank you for your insight.  I live in the US so that may be why I have a hard time imaging making the full switch.
@_date: 2016-07-16 19:55:50
Thank you for the advice

I'm in the same boat.  I know with circle I could convert my pay to btc but everything I buy would need to be covered back into Fiat.  I've seen some bitcoin visa cards but I don't know if they offer the same consumer protections as my current CC.  
My biggest concern would be the price of btc plummeting and losing all my savings.  Right now I'm treating it as an investment but I would like to see it catch on and overtake Fiat money in popularity and usage.
