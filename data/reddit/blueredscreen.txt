The guy he wrote the patent application with also has [two]( [weird]( patents of his own.

How do you remember your username?
@_date: 2015-12-11 15:49:22
Wait, are you really doing that or are you joking?

Not surprisingly, he was one of the bitcoin xt devs....

If you mention Pandora's Box then you're probably saying useless things.
@_date: 2016-02-29 21:57:54
How so?
@_date: 2016-02-29 21:54:15
But don't you think finding out who he is is interesting?
@_date: 2016-02-29 21:46:54
Why so?
@_date: 2016-02-29 21:55:37
How so?
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:13:45
But interesting it surely is, no?
@_date: 2016-02-29 21:57:17
If you say "lol" then you're probably mad.
@_date: 2015-11-05 17:28:35
One rule for each fork then, you think?

I really miss 2008/2009
Back then, 1 btc = $10000 
And where is this now? :(
@_date: 2015-11-05 18:15:16
I don't think the mods care, really.
@_date: 2015-11-05 03:27:06
So, is this just a euphemism for "No Bitcoin XT posts allowed"?
I mean, I don't like Bitcoin XT myself, but if you're going to post rules, stop hiding them.

It could update the sticky every X hours or so.
My suggestion would be every 3 hours, as this allows enough discussion to happen in the comments before the sticky is deleted and a new one is placed instead of it.
