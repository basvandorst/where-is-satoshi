On the bunch of Cryptocurencies Exchanges online, users offer their bitcoin at a price and buyers offer their currencies for a number of bitcoins. They are a lot, so there is no problem to buy or sell.
You can then withdraw bitcoin on your bitcoin wallet or money to your bank.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:19:48
So, if you have your private keys, no one can size or freeze them.

That's what i don't fully understand. Can you explain the differences between public adress and public key, and why knowing public adress doesn't mean knowing the public key ?
@_date: 2017-02-02 00:43:44
According to  :
"The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 100 satoshis/byte, shown in green at the top.
For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 22,600 satoshis."
@_date: 2017-02-24 16:21:35
Where does the error come from ? coinb.in ?
Broadcast the tx on &gt;  &lt;
@_date: 2017-02-02 00:35:20
It's not related to electrum, simply because of the tiny fee. But it's normal. Depending on your fee, it can even take some days. I often do that for transactions where i don't worry about confirmation time.
@_date: 2017-02-23 12:15:15
I use bc.info and when I need to move btc between my accounts, I just change the fee to 0,01$. I usally wait a week or so, but don't care that much. I'm not in a hurry.
Your holding seems composed of lot of unspend outputs, so you probably need bigger fees. I'd say try with 2$ at first, or any amount that is ok for you, and wait. Then raise after à week if that doesn't work.
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:11:37
I see! Well you'll have to do it with an other wallet or sometime use coinb.in for offline transactions. You have total control on the fees.
You have to enter all the inputs, send everything to one or more adress, indicate the fees and then sign with your private key offline. Inport the raw transaction and broadcast it to the network.
Do you have access to the private keys?

Bitcoin owe you nothing bro, it's just a software! If people tell you that it's free and instant, well... you've been lied to. It was at the begining, and maybe can achieve future updates to conform again to it, but it's not anymore.

Long position, hold the coins. The halving is coming in a few days! Crazy price increase coming before 2017.
@_date: 2016-06-12 12:20:01
Ok I understand your point! But man, I don't understand pricing for example 1BTC = 1 ounce, if bitcoin is slowly going to the moon.  And when Bitcoin does +10%, we'll just say ok, 1BTC = 1,1 ounce, but we'll have to be realists it'll be also comparing it to fiat. Bitcoin will be the standard when it will have landed on the moon no?
Bitcoin is a good currency, and has a fantastic growth.
Dollar is a shtty currency, but is actually more stable than Bitcoin to compare price of goods.

No one said seriously it's actually a stable currency. But, probably one thing you don't understand, the more people get into bitcoin, the more stable it gets. Of course we're still at a early adopting phase for a currency, leading lot of speculators to profit from the volatility. But who cares of volatility, when you know that, in the long term, it will be more and more valuable and then gaining in stability.

In fact, if miners profit decrease, some are forced to give up, but then it's more profitable for the remaining miners. The fees choosed by the miners guaranty there will always have reward for mining. Also the price, increasing, will likely help to compensate the halvings. And even if price doesn't x2, there always be a balance. So there will always be some miners to run the network. Some are even running at loss.
@_date: 2017-01-04 00:37:35

@_date: 2016-12-02 04:44:48
No fees, means no incentive for miners to accept many transactions, and this would lead to a much more blocked network !
I guess that's not what you want.
@_date: 2016-12-23 09:45:01
Think they came with a new kind of wallet. They kept all your old adresses, and added that 'MyWallet' thing where probably multiple adresses are linked to the same seed phrase.
If you put btc into the 'MyWallet' adress, it then change adress every time you use it, providing more privacy and still recoverable with the same seed phrase.

It's focus on the positive side. Many people are long term investors. So when there's a big step like 900, lot of people post. But when the price then corrects, no one of theses investors really care.

No they can't hack bitcoin. The only thing they can do is controling 50%+ of the mining power, and 'de facto' controling bitcoin. But...

@_date: 2016-05-18 09:37:55
no it's not possible, because you signed a transaction that was spread into the network and is crypographicaly valid.
You just have to wait what will happen :) (if it's included in a block or no)
@_date: 2017-05-24 08:37:57
I have always wondered, someone could just keep the private key of the coin, sell the coin and then use the bitcoin.
Is there anything to avoid this ?
@_date: 2016-05-23 21:08:00
The transaction has probably not been included in any block for now. But as it is pending, the wallet detect the funds try to be included in a block to actualy proceed the transaction.
No problem, you have just to wait. Either it's going to include the tx and so they'll arrive to the destination, either you will be able to spend them again soon.
What was your tx fee ?
@_date: 2016-05-07 07:51:06
He provided in his blog a signature, but people discovered quickly that it was the signature of a 2009 transaction and not a 2016 signature of his texte of Sartre or anything else. So everyone could have access to the signature he gave...
@_date: 2016-05-24 10:22:43
It isn't on the blockchain, because it hasn't been included in a block. But all transactions goes at first in a pool of unconfirmed transactions, the miners pick transactions they want to include in their next block from this pool.
Your wallet detects an unconfirmed transaction is pending in this pool. If there is no confirmation, it's like your bitcoins hasn't really been spent. With some wallets, it's possible to sign an other transaction with the same bitcoins (for people who want to put a better fee, for the second tx to be accepted faster, but for you the problem is not the fee i think) so there's two transactions in the pool, but in the end only one will be accepted.
@_date: 2016-05-19 22:57:24

@_date: 2016-05-06 20:43:04
I would say you'd rather store your btcs by dividing them into separate paper wallets, because so you can withdraw one each time and the others remain cold wallets. So the remaining private keys are never at risk.
I personaly have only one cold wallet, because i'm aiming long term for most of my btc, and don't plan to spend court term.
@_date: 2016-07-14 13:41:48
If you doesn't need that transaction to be processed quickly, i would just advice a 0.5$ fee or even less. I think the dynamic fee system of blockchain.info is a bit generous for miners ^^
A classic 1 output tx is like 0.05$. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 12:35:28
Short term: miners could sell and crash price if they kept a lot BTC.
Mid term: offer will drop because of the supply halving.
Long term: increase in price !
@_date: 2016-05-18 22:37:27
No impossible. I don't know how your wallet works, it probably detects some of your funds are currently trying to be transacted but the transaction has not yet been acceped, so it don't allow you to spend them in an other transaction. But it's just the rules established by the wallet, not by Bitcoin itself.
I personnaly use Blockchain.info and i sometimes had the same problem you had. During for exemple 2 days, blockchain.info don't allow you to re-spend the stuck funds, but after that time it concider the transaction will probably never be included in a block and so allow you after that period to do an other transaction with the funds.
@_date: 2016-07-18 01:12:03
Website blockchain.info has the watch only thing, just enter your public key. Then get their app on your mobile and you can watch easily your funds without any risk.
