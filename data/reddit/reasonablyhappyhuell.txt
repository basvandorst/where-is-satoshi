So on sites like cryptothrift I noticed that items like $500 gift cards were selling for roughly $88 instead of fully value (Buy it now) is this unusual or would I be better off at under listing items that I may put up to sell?

Thank you for that! So far it looks like it will be very helpful as a crash course! I will definitely keep watching that later tonight when I get a chance

I have been holding on to my measly .21btc for a while now... never really thought I would see the day it topped 1000 again... let alone the 1180 it hit today... wish I would have gotten it up to 1btc while it was cheaper
