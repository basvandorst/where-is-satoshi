1. Use either Coinbase/GDAX or Gemini to buy Bitcoin with Fiat. These are the exchanges I personally use.
2. Personal worth is a varied statement. Whether you use it as an investment tool, a currency to replace some Fiat transactions, believing in the technology underneath the hood and wanting to support it, etc. all vary and you‘ll only ever know the answer to how much it‘s worth regarding yourself.

Perhaps if you did you'd know that not only do you earn rebates on limit orders (which you should really be using anyways. I myself only use limit orders with exception to trailing take profits), but BitMEX clearly tells you all fees are based on your order size, not your capital. Furthermore, you can also earn funding fees from other traders as well. I knew all of these benefits (and all potential downsides) before opening an account, as anyone doing their DD should.
As far as the high leverage goes, BitMEX does indeed offer 100x leverage. There is nothing wrong with advertising this. It's their unique niche in crypto-derivatives. However, even the least intelligent of traders know that, in practice, going 100x is a terrible idea regardless.
There's no point in bashing BitMEX when you aren't even a customer of theirs; you're just giving them free advertising at this point. If you're unhappy with the number of options available to retail traders, go open your own exchange. If it's better than BitMEX, people will use it.

Yes, I‘ve had zero issues with those exchanges other than potential downtimes of the websites (like when bitcoin first reached 10k). All 3 also have pretty rigorous KYC policies to eliminate fraud as well.

bitcoin.org is the real site.

This might be a stretch but just in case: is there even a password at all, as in, would it just be blank?

Probably the BTC/BCH fork that happened on Aug 1st. If you had BTC in that wallet at the time you'd have an identical amount of BCH in there.

GDAX, Binance and Bitmex. The holy trinity of exchanges. One feeless, one altcoiny and one leveragey.

has anyone still solved that 1flamen6 puzzle in this picture?

I don't get it.  
How do you spend USD? 1 dollar is 1 dollar so you buy something for $0.99 and use dollar but you pay 0.99? That just seems odd using a percentage of a currency to pay for something. I've read online it can be used to buy flights, hotel rooms, used on overstock dot com and even used for reddit gold. Also in addition to my prior confusion I see no way to change the currency to EUR to do those things.

Y‘know there‘s this cool thing called Google. It can pretty much answer these kinda questions for you.
