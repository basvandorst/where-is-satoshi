Perhaps the authorities in Japan are sorting that out as he has been in jail for 10 months, recently released on bail IIRC. I am not sure what is going on over there.

Well there's some rumor that the point of the bitgo system was to run around this regulation. It may have been that the only way they could resume US business quickly was to make a token change to their business model. CTFC were fools if they accepted this change as addressing the concerns about futures. Maybe Bitfinex were too impatient to go through the registration process or otherwise wanted to avoid it. This is all total speculation. 
The official PR from bitfinex only said that they were making changes to their business model in response to the agreement with the CTFC, and made no mention of registering.

Argument from authority is a logical fallacy. I am still not sure what exactly the bitgo service is supposed to provide. 
Bitfinex is far from anonymous as they are officially registered with governments and corporations in various ways in a number of countries. Mark Karpeles recently spent 10 months in jail and prison is still a possibility in the future. I imagine the operators of Bitfinex know this. That doesn't mean it wasn't an inside job from a disgruntled actor at BitFinex with minimal stake (or willing to go against their own self interest). Additionally, if the exchange is deemed insolvent by the owners then their motivation to embezzle changes. But I have my doubts about the "easy, well planned theft, total conspiracy by the owners" narrative. If it is the owners it at fault it could be a rash act of desperation.

People still use Poloniex. That being said the focus here should be on the customers' present situation.
