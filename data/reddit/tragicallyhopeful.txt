@_date: 2018-01-23 18:05:56
Coin with 21M coin supply
First 20M coins sell for an average of $1 each. $20M in fiat enters system.
Over the course of the next couple years, the final million sell for an average of $1,000 each.  ($1B additional dollars enter system).
Price is at $1,000. Market cap = $1,000 * 21M = $21B but only $1,001,000,000 has entered the system. Where are you going to get the extra $19,999,000,000 if everyone wants to cash out?

No. cryptocurrencies present an attempt at replacing one money system with another with the sole intent of gaining wealth by removing it from those that currently have it. It is an attempt at a coup of sorts. 


Horseshit. All money/value is "created". It is a human construct that has been fine tuned over thousands of years into an amazing system that can keep people content while the population expands exponentially. Bitcoin is a fucking joke that, if it replaced the USD, would lead to a global financial meltdown and all out chaos (precisely what many anarchists hope for in their heads although they would shit their pants and cry for help if it actually happened.)

Until Bitfinex/Tether show that they actually have the equivalent USD on hand (even though ther T&amp;C say they don't have to exchange it back for Tethers), isn't the arbitrary 1 USD = 1 USDT based 100% on "trust"?

Before Polaroids, pedophiles had to develop film themselves. Before digital photography, pedophiles had to use polaroids or develop their film themselves. Before the internet, pedophiles had to find each other "offline". Every "innovation" makes it easier. I am not saying Bitcoin is only used by or exclusively used by these people, but it has helped these people by adding one more way to avoid getting caught doing what they do. 
The issue is that illicit activities are pretty much the only area where Bitcoin has "improved" the transfer of funds. They only problems it is solving are those of criminals that the government is trying to catch and those of paranoid schizophrenics who just think the government gives a flying fuck about what they are doing.

Um, no, paper money would literally be the only money that would still work. Are you high?

Would love to know how you would feel if that hit had been ordered against you or someone you loved. 
You do realize that ordering the murder of another person puts that person's "life in the balance", right? People aren't just entries in a digital ledger, people are actually important.

It will be solved by blockchain (somehow?). Blockchain is always the answer, even when nobody is asking a question.

Where are you going to get the extra bitcoin?

Basic math isn't that difficult man. Come on.

Sounds like that's the conclusion you came to all on your own.

You expect plenty of people to show up and buy a shit ton of hardware and spend millions of dollars (at a loss) mining bitcoin just so that you could continue to "hodl" it and not even use it to do anything with? Why?
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:13:16


... you just have a whole bunch of used and abused graphics cards.

If miners stopped mining bitcoin, you would have to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire enough computing power to find a block and move your bitcoin. But where would you move even move it? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:39:52
So the same as the money in the bank then if the "evil bank" decided to lock you out?
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:17:33
If the miners stop mining, is it really your bitcoin?

- It's what everyone hopes to sell their crypto for someday and get a bunch of

While $9.3 billion may seem like a huge amount, if he manages to win the $10.7 billion dollar lawsuit, he would be lucky to collect even a portion of the $8.4 billion dollars.

The difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks. If miners were to abandon Bitcoin, you would need to mine between 0 and 2016 blocks to get the difficulty to adjust. even if the difficulty were 1/100th of what it is right now when they stopped, you would never be able to mine even 1 more block without investing a very large amount of money into equipment.

*Suffered through 18 years of listening to my father trying to shill me bitcoin, and all I got for it was this worthless entry in a digital ledger that stopped being mined years ago.*

Several exchanges offer it. And with leverage too
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:26:27
Probably 100k with 100x leverage but still. Rekt indeed.

You can short through several exchanges. Bitmex, bottomed, etc...

Nah man, bitcoin has lost half its value over the last week, they're "only" $6k each now. lol

You sound like you have no clue how shorts and/or leverage work.

Almost 18% of the worlds population lives in India. That is a massive chunk of the global population.
