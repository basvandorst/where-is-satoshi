It appears to me like some company opened a bitcoin exchange in a country just rocked by a currency crisis. Like they were desperate for an alternative and this new bitcoin bank opened up, they exchanged their currency for bitcoins and now their bitcoins are apparently gone into the ether. Which is pretty fucked up to say the least, if that's accurate and this isn't some big misunderstanding.

Isn't that what Gox was to a lot of people? "Working software" being a pretty subjective opinion and all that.

That guy really did take the life savings from people who just went through a financial crisis and leave. That is some super villain type shit right there. I hope they find this asshole and give him what he deserves.

Didn't neo and bee literally just open up? Was it a scam all along?

So what happens when these machines come to the same conclusion? What if they decide the world will work better without us? Obviously right now these seem like some silly science fiction questions but in 10, 20, 30 years they might not be so silly. 
In solving one problem (humans are inherently evil, which may or may not be accurate, that's a debate for people smarter than me) we may be creating an entire new set of problems that we are incapable of dealing with.

I bought 300 dollars worth for the first time last week. By the time my purchase actually went through on coinbase the magic internet money I got so I can order some weed lost 15% of it's value. 
This shit is way too volatile to consider an actual currency. If it loses value you get pissed and lose trust in it as a currency. If it gains value people hoard them and then it loses its value as a currency. I don't know, doesn't make much sense to me.

This isn't a stock.

If I have to do all that to use bitcoins then why bother in the first place? At least 100k of cash is insured at the bank. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:11:14


Which is sadly why this version of bitcoin will probably fail. If it's not easy to use and secure then there is no good reason for the average joe to use it over cash.

I'd be careful fucking with the IRS. That's not really a move you want to make.

You want to put all of our trust into an autonomous computer program and treat the computer program like God? Ballsy. I like it. Not sure it's the best idea but let's see where it goes.

It's a confusing article. The timeline seems a little weird. So what did that guy get threatened for? What exactly are people mad about? 
And apparently he's not the CEO anymore? He has no equity in the business and apparently had large amount of bitcoins on mt gox, which the business depended on for some reason. Now he has to find someone willing to buy the debt and essentially a store front with a shitty logo. 
The whole thing sounds shady to me. Dude fled the country, went into hiding, and apparently severed ties with the company. And now nobody really knows what is going on.

So is there anything to stop just anyone from making a Bitcoin exchange? I would assume not since this is kind of the wild west of the currency world, which is pretty scary. 
So I have a certain amount of money on coinbase right now, is it possible that they could decide it's more profitable to close up shop and walk away with all those bitcoins? Would there be anything the user base could do about it? Is that what happened with Mt. Gox?
This is pretty concerning for me. I don't want to keep my bitcoins on my computer. I have enough trouble finding important work files on my computer, I don't trust myself to keep actual money on there. I'd rather leave that to people more qualified than myself. I know my Bank of America money will not disappear from my bank account and if for some reason it does, it's insured and BoA will take care of it. If I had my money on my computer I'd be seriously paranoid all the time. Shit, what if some dick breaks into my house and just takes my computer? I'm totally screwed then.

Bull fighting is a safe sport and you should try it.

It won't become widely adopted if people have to do that. It sounds like a pain in the ass.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:08:11


I would if I could. I like the idea of an anonymous internet currency but bitcoins are not very practical in their current state. Exchanging them for goods &amp; services seems like the last thing people want to do with them.

If by "right" you mean "pseudo intellectual bullshit", then you are correct. He's projecting his personal problems onto every single woman in the world, which is pathetic. He's even managing to roll his problems with "the state" and women all into one. Which is double pathetic and if you find yourself agreeing with this nutjob, then you need to take a look in the mirror.

Dude you need therapy.

That's unwise. You shouldn't start wars you can't win.

Because it's dumb as rocks and dude is trying to scam you out of real life money.
