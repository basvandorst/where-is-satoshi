The 2 pizzas for 10000 BTC was widely considered the first transaction for something of value; that set the initial value of a bitcoin. Previous transactions were for testing or fun only... at the time buying pizza and receiving  bitcoins was considered crazy and without someone taking that risk Bitcoin may not be where it is today.

I don't know what free banking is, why is this a phrase?  No annual or monthly fee? No minimum balance? No inactive account fee? No fee for sending, receiving automated clearing house, or bill pay? No fee to see a teller?  I get all that stuff from my local credit union.  Small fee to send a wire or buy paper cheques.  That's it. They also don't charge to use another bank's automated teller machine.  I guess negative interest rates makes banking unsustainable with the model of earning interest on deposits, but if banks are charging fees I'm not sure why anyone uses them.  My credit union is member owned and nonprofit so all rates are lower.

Skimmed. Overall I was disappointed. Long detailed article about how to send transactions to reduce the probability of being traced by a botnet of sybil nodes.

Lol @ mining license.  Does that mean it calls home before it starts mining?  If this company ever goes out of business or has an outage, your investment becomes useless.  Also, even when available, the central control panel means they (or an attacker who gains control) can redirect your hashes without permission.   That could contribute to a 51% attack, attack on alternate chains.  That's even assuming they don't embed some more nefarious circuitry into the design, such as gps tracking, remote destruct, or a general purpose computer they control.   Customers need to demand an open source asic and no central control.

"Are they doing useful work while not able to connect to the internet?" - Short answer: No.
For mining, you'll need an Internet connection for several reasons. 1. to obtain the latest block chain to add onto- only the longest block chain matters.  2. to obtain recent transactions to put into a block.  3. to send your block to the network before anyone else. If someone gets a block before you, which becomes part of the longst chain, yours doesn't count.
Unfortunately, miners don't necessarily stop if bitcoin has no connections and bitcoin doesn't always detect it lost all its connections.  It's up to you to make sure you're connected to at least some peers.

It's not that we don't trust you. It's that it's a bad idea to get blockchains without verifying every block. If you start a trend of people doing this, and it becomes accepted, eventually someone will get scammed.  There's already a blockchain download at the official Bitcoin download site at sourceforge.net, updated occasionally.  Perhaps you could simply, redirect there?  
At least, consider PGP-signing your blockchain so those who choose to download, can know who they're trusting :)

The statistic has to include remainders, as there is no way to tell which coins were sent and which were remainder.

Security, in the form of confirmations, is demanded by the payee, not the payer.  The number of confirmations (blocks containing your transaction) _is_ security.  You can't receive goods until you get the blocks.  The payer may see it as convenience to increase the speed of their confirmations, but at some point there's so many free transactions in the pool that free transactions effectively never get processed.  Then, people will start paying a transaction fee.

Let me see if I understand.  When Coinbase sends ETH, if there is a valid ETC balance in the same address, the transaction may be replayed on the ETC blockchain. The only reason this is important is that ETC has market value on other exchanges. A Coinbase user might sue Coinbase, claiming they would have had more money, if Coinbase had allowed the user to control the ETC balance associated with their ETH.  A court might force Coinbase to compensate customers, and Coinbase might run into financial trouble down the road.  Thus if users deposited BTC in Coinbase they might be in trouble.  Is this what Peter is getting at?

The amount of the trade doesn't affect the fee percentage, so what you meant to say was the price change (difference in price you sold and bought at) was not large enough to cover the fee.  You'd have lost the same proportion to fees with a bigger trade at the same prices, or would have lost more due to slippage.

wallet.dat has the keys to spend your bitcoins. Back it up regularly as new keys are added to the wallet as you use it.  You may back up, reinstall, make sure bitcoin isn't running, then restore the wallet.dat from your backup into place to restore it.

Check out bitcoin-otc.com for a system already using PGP and bitcoin addresses to verify identity and provide a reputation system for p2p trades.  It's tightly integrated with IRC by having a bot to link your ID with your IRC session and to rate people and place buy and sell orders.  Talk to nanotube who runs the bot and site if you want to collaborate.
Pecunix.com supports a PGP key login method. (gold, not bitcoin related, I think some of the same people are doing stuff with voucher-safe now)
MPEx uses PGP emails to place orders.  
One way you could use PGP with arbitration is to provide a private messaging service where all messages are required to be encrypted (you can not encrypt messages using Bitcoin addresses, only sign).  If the parties wish to use arbitration they can encrypt each message to the key of the arbitrator in advance.   Then in case of a dispute the arbitrator is given access to the messages, decrypts them and makes a decision.  This could be combined with multisigning transactions.
Contracts should be signed by all parties in advance and perhaps merge-mined into the blockchain to timestamp them.

They neglect to mention the most likely risk: that Panama and every other jurisdiction will refuse their request to form a bank, or shut it down shortly thereafter.  Another likely risk: if they do get a banking license, they will be required to enact such strict KYC rules for opening an account that they may not be able to afford to hire the staff to monitor their compliance department, and do not get enough customers willing to share the information to make a profit.  Seems odd that they would plan to incorporate outside the U.S. and mention the Bank Secrecy Act instead of FATCA.  It doesn't look like authors of the prospectus did enough research.  An international bank needs correspondent accounts at a U.S. bank, that is likely to be rejected by every U.S. bank as well since this bank is explicitly stating its purpose is to trade cryptocurrencies.

1. identity should be linked to PGP keys. It's already decentralized. Bitcoin addresses should be used only once to receive coins, for security and privacy even for legal transactions.  A way this can work is to host a central board where users may post PGP-signed statements of facts.  Using a BTC address for signing can be okay but keep it separate from receiving coins.
2. Please don't try to implement coin tainting.  It will not work to stop theft, instead harming the innocent, and decreases the value of bitcoin by adding uncertainty.  Certainly posting txids of fraud is okay but don't expect to have much impact if they've been spent further.
3. open-transactions and ripple integration should be considered.
