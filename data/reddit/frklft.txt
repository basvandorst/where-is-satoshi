The idea is to actually dominate your dividends and share price in BTC, without it being just a skin over fixed fiat values. You can't practically do this because BTC jumps around, while if fiat moves 10% in a year (or appreciates at all) that's verging on catastrophic.
Moreover, it would actually be an awful idea to make an organization that dominates BTC trading quite that able to profit from price fluctuations that they can influence.

If you had that much volatility in fiat there would be a revolution.

The problem with crypto is instability and deflation. If I promise to pay someone $100 in a year, we both a have a pretty good idea of what that will be worth by then. If I promised, a year ago, to pay someone 0.1 BTC today, I'd be out like $1300. You straight up can't use bitcoin for loans, debt, etc... 
To put the point another way: If you put $100 into Boeing stock at the start of 2017, you'd have about $197 worth of Boeing stock today. If you'd put 0.1 BTC (then worth about $100) in at the same time, you'd have about 0.013 BTC, a massive loss! BTC is therefore unusable for investing.
Note as well that the value of BTC is always stated in terms of some stable currency. We need a currency that we know will be worth about the same thing next year as it is now. That's why fiat isn't going anywhere.

Is that something?

I can promise that a USD well buy roughly the same a year from now as it does today. No one can say that about BTC, ETH, or doge.

Really? Lots of folks out there still speaking Occitan, building with asbestos, and selling cars that don't meet emissions standards?
Prohibition can work. Even with alcohol, there's evidence it really did cut consumption. Moreover, if nation state action against cryptos didn't work, why would anyone care if China or South Korea banned trading?
