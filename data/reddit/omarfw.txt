I hate delusional people as well, but I've yet to meet a capitalist who thought it didn't have any downsides whatsoever.
I have however met quite a few people who believe true socialism has essentially zero downsides but has never been properly implemented. That's just as delusional imo

I bought a year of vpn service with btc for the first time recently
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:15:59
Imagine how I feel about buying at 10k, expecting a bull run. Wasn't very much though so I'm good.
Hodl and wait it out.
@_date: 2018-05-18 00:17:42
Can you give a rundown on why that is? I'm a noob
@_date: 2018-05-23 00:54:11
I'm pretty much just buying gradually and hodling for a future fiat blowout at this point. Got my fireproof safe and a cold wallet on the way. Even if the market has a major dip, it will always come back. BTC is the inevitable future of economics.

Reddit as a whole seems to think that making someone infamous is how you destroy them.
Spoiler alert: it's not.
@_date: 2018-05-04 13:25:26
that's why your should never say "lightning", just "lightning network" since that's what it is, and it sounds less like another altcoin that way.
you gotta spoon feed the dumbies
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:36:29
Fuck your collectivist bs. Bitcoin isn't a club and you aren't a gatekeeper. Grow up.

The only bored ones are those who just want their lambos and fomo'd at 10k this year.

This. Flexing is a stupid, childish behavior anyway that will only attract malicious or parasitic attention to yourself.

Because it's too young. Cryptocurrency as a whole is too young to maintain stability. It's seen as primarily a means to acquire more fiat right now. Once it becomes more integrated with consumer level purchasing (ala the lightning network) it will stabilize gradually.
@_date: 2018-05-04 13:34:16
It's literally talking about why you shouldn't buy these altcoins. Are you blind?

The only people who should be giving investment advice are investment experts, which I assume you're not. The situation you've found yourself in is the exact reason why.
Don't ever put yourself in a situation where your encouragement is potentially responsible for putting a friend in a financially bad state. It's not the end of the world if people you care about don't jump on the train while the tickets are cheap. You're gambling your friendship with them for money. Money is worthless compared to friendship.

that's a very narrow-minded perspective on how positive people look at the world. positivity and ignorance are not mutually exclusive.

It was at 6k for a while too. People need to pay attention all the time, not just when the surges hit the news cycle.

yup, critics can't and won't stop progress. They never have in the long term. It's pointless to acknowledge them or let them ruin your mood.

Care to back that statement up with some evidence?

The only people who claim he's conservative are those who have never actually listened to his lectures. He's a classical liberal who voices his concerns about radical progressives and the dangers of collectivism and censorship.
'Conservative' isn't defined as merely 'someone who argues against radical progressives'. 'Psuedointellectual' doesn't mean "ideas I disagree with". The dude has been a tenured professor and psychologist for decades, so unless you have an equally impressive academic career, you aren't qualified to label him a psuedointellectual.
Quit your reductionist bullshit.
