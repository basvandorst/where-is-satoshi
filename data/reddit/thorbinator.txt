That's demonstrably wrong. It's bitcoin transactions in a hub and spoke model. The worst that can happen is a hub goes down and you have to wait for your nLockTime transactions forming the payment channel to expire. Under no circumstances does it lock anyone out of the network. Yes the transactions are off-chain, but they are still valid bitcoin transactions that can be rebroadcast in case of failure.

It's notable because it's exceptional and contentious. Other large changes like BIP66 went through without issue. 
Frankly, political issues get "solved" with politics. This is one issue that wasn't immediately technologically solvable so it became a political issue. I don't forsee other issues escalating to political ones, but that may be a lack of imagination on my part.
I agree that technical people don't enjoy having to politik and that's a good thing. The vast majority of bitcoin's development should be about what is technically sound.

That's related, but not directly. If miner nodes are set up to directly connect to each other, the only limiting factor is their bandwidth as they posted. Network propagation is only relevant for informing the rest of the network, which isn't time sensitive as all the miners have their block directly from them. The only person at risk of an orphan is the miner outside of this direct connect system, which is an element of centralization but not an insurmountable one.

I see a lot of disingenuous comparing of mining pools to actual-ownership miners. If a pool becomes evil and attacks the network, the miners on the pool that object will take their hashes elsewhere. 
Yes, it's an element of centralization. But because it can lose hashrate with unpopular decisions, the miners retain most of the control of what their hashes are supporting. This is a far cry from large powerbloc miners that have no fear of their hashrate leaving.

Well that's concerning. Freedom to trade means nothing if it is trivially restricted by the whims of people living on one side of a line in the dirt. If OB/OB1 is only setting it's sights on the whitest of the white markets than it is a conceptual failure in my opinion. The only reason bitcoin has value is that it's decentralized nature allows it to ignore laws by virtue of being difficult to police. 
Don't get me wrong, I have a background in networking and security and understand that you're building a massive undertaking with just the protocol on top of all the other work being done. That undertaking would be far, far larger with the condition of anonymity and it's understandable that it's out of scope. I don't have the skills to contribute and the most annoying thing you can read as a dev is anonymous naysayers crapping on your work. 
But I really do think it should be a high priority. OB should enable ebay clones and third world regime undermining and drug sales, not just ebay clones. People in turkey [needed to subvert authority to communicate]( what if they could trade without fear as well?

Basically everyone gets up in arms about no trust and perfectly secure and everything else being worthless. There are situations where you can relax that, like a restaurant meal or buying coffee.
Those settings already have an element of trust, the restaurant trusts you to not get up and walk out the door before the bill comes. In those situations, accepting a propagated transaction with no double spend attempt detected is sufficient to have a lower required trust than normal methods.
People don't bother counterfeiting 1 dollar bills, and nobody is going to 51% attack for a cup of coffee. The more trivial methods of generating a 0-confirmation doublespend are easy to detect, from what I know.

Yes, dollars are in fact competing with food. Would you rather have 100 dollars or a full fridge at this moment? Would you rather have a million dollars or a million burgers right now? Money is only one way of expressing value.
It is similar with usd and eur. They both compete overtly for world reserve currency. USD is winning at 64% and eur is 24%. They also compete for international business, such as the landmark natural gas trade between china and russia signed last month. That is billions less demand for usd or eur because they are doing the deal in their native currencies instead. That is a real competition and happens every day.

1: Financially in bitcoin no, ideologically or being paid off yes. Much safer to not give them the option.
2: No. They choose which doublespends to include, they can't create transactions out of whole cloth. An example is a huge spend to an exchange, cash out, then release your secret chain that actually sends the coin to yourself.

The forming digital economy around bitcoin is trustless. You cannot appeal to a third party entity to reverse the transaction.

I'll spell it out for you. This post is on the front page of bitcoin and it's a pro-dogecoin article. IT SHOULD NOT BE HERE. Every day there is a brigaded pro-altcoin topic on here that serves no purpose but to evangelize how great they are.
It's similar to if someone in real life went around saying they were nicer than you. "But that's kind of a jerk thing to say to my face"

No, you cannot steal the block. You only get credit from the pool for submitting blocks that pay out to the pool. There is no way to suddenly change a block you mined to have an output to you.

Speculative investment vs. transactional use is a negative feedback loop. High speculation/volatility leads to lower transactional use. Steady transactional use gives a gradual increase in price, which can spark bubbles.

Source: my ass.


It's possible, but that's not the method I would use. Regular pools cut down on spam by accepting coins to a central address, keeping a database of miner contributions/balances, and paying out at user-set amounts usually with a minimum. What P2pool does now is collapse the accepting coins and keeping balances into a big coinbase transaction that pays fairly. What P2Pool could do in the future is use M of N or escrow to cut down on spam while still paying fairly, that would be a worthy goal of op's coin and I'm not sure how it would work.

Align the incentives properly and let the free market work it's magic. The hard part is aligning those incentives. For example: in bitcoin only the miners are paid, while every full node must shoulder the bandwidth and storage costs. That is a misalignment of incentives, one that results in a declining full node count and makes full nodes require charity to stay up.

Transactions per block average: 575  
Block size in mb average: .3181
1,000,000/575 = 1739.13x larger network
1739.13 x .3181 = 553.2 Mb per block, 3.3 gigs an hour, ~80 Gb/day
more math: this drive is $140 for 4tb. At 100k tx/min, that drive fills up in 50 days. So it costs at the bare minimum 2.8 bucks a day or $84/month to run a full archive node.

Default clientside blacklists for guns, drugs, and CP terms.
Make you go through several hoops and "I understand this crap might land me in federal pound-me-in-the-ass prison" checkboxes. Maybe make one of the buttons to do so a random piece of screen indistinguishable from any other with no cursor changes.
Gate off CP even harder from the guns and drugs. Make it literally impossible for grandma to accidentally view CP. Four indistinguishable spots on the screen that have to be clicked in order with correct-ish timing. Only publish the instructions to unlock it online once. It will stay around.
That will work for downplaying the illicit parts, I'm not sure how to drum up normal business other than successful usage and normal announcements. It might be worth asking big bitcoin players to help promote it once you have it up and running.

Havelock is shitting the bed right now, here is a link to the prospectus for when it decides to work. 
The costs of maintaining the mine are: electricity costs, hosting costs, management 
fees, shipping, import tax and maintenance costs. We will charge all of these costs in 
a fixed hosting fee of 0.25 $/kWh. On top of this, our new hardware only consumes 
0.785 Watt/GH, which is the best performance on the market. This means the costs 
of PetaMine are just a fraction of our competition’s costs. 
 
We will continuously update the mine with the latest hardware developments. When 
necessary, we will replace hardware with more power efficient equipment; this way 
we decrease electricity costs of the mine even further.

We've already had one fork because of a bug caused by going *near* the max block size. Upping the Tx size is "simple" until it isn't because you don't know what assumptions were made based on that block size. It also ties into the economics of mining, some miners already include almost no transactions for the sheer reason of broadcasting faster to get the coinbase transaction.
Also it's not actually a priority right now. We aren't up against the wall yet. It should be a priority because bitcoin adoption tends to move in leaps and bounds.

It doesn't matter? Are you not curious at all what could have provoked such a visceral reaction in another human being? **Hate** is no trivial matter.
I'll tell you, and I'll tell the spectators as well. It is because you are attacking us. But it is not a traditional attack brought with violence, or angry words. It is an attack borne of marketing, of smiling faces knocking on your door, asking if you have heard the good news. 
The attack is carried out with a tainted giving, the tip culture you embrace. You embrace it because it is an effective marketing tool, working with quirks of psychology. Gee golly, you gave him 2000 of something, amazing! Oh wait, it is worth a pack of skittles. A typical doge tip is 100 or less. 5 cents worth at the time of writing. 
Let's look at the costs and benefits of a typical 100 doge tip. You lose: 100 doge. You gain: good feelings, adoption increase, being the "better man", and a good reputation for your coin.   The recipient gains: 100 doge, not 5 cents. The recipient loses: about 10 hours of effort learning about doge, signing up for an exchange, and making the trade to something he wants to use. Or even better for you, spending it. I assume 10 for someone wholly ignorant about crypto, on the low side. If that person only values their time at minimum wage, you just made them spend 72 dollars to gain 5 cents and an introduction to your club.
You can see here, that tipping small amounts of an obscure cryptocurrency is an inherently selfish act. It's no wonder it is so heavily promoted in and reddcoin tipping is banned. You recognize a competitor using the same technique.
In addition to all that, you get to play the martyr when someone calls you on your selfish behavior. And everyone in the conversation believes you, because they haven't done the math. I await my downvotes for daring to disagree with the dogemind.

Quite a few did. 
Feds will/has set up fake sellers. The problem with that is that you must build a reputation (actually sell drugs) before long-time users will trust you. If someone has spent years building their online reputation, they're less likely to throw that away going after joe schmoe, which isn't even a guarantee if they take proper precautions with the package. "0/10 cops threw me in jail" reviews tend to stick out.
Buyers can protect their identities by using abandoned houses or PO boxes for the shipping, and most importantly by not legally claiming/opening a package for some amount of time. If they raid you and you left the box just inside your front door for a day or two, you can reasonably claim that you were going to take it back to the post office when you found the time. If your computer is properly encrypted or hidden, you claiming the package is critical to their prosecution.

Nope. You know why? Bitcoin solves your expensive middlemen meddling with technology. 


If regulation creeps in, it's because of shortsighted morons like you begging for our benevolent rulers to force it on business. Even then, the best you can do is stratify bitcoin, destroying fungibility. Do you even realize the reason bitcoin has any value whatsoever? **It's because it solves the problem of banks, middlemen, and money printing. It does so in an open source and voluntary way.**
Where is the value of your vaunted institution when wikileaks was under financial embargo? What are our glorious banking overlords actually doing to prevent terrorism, besides blocking pot shops from depositing their cash? Bitcoin doesn't have anything on the hawala system for funding nutjobs.


No, its a good thing in every sense. It's something you don't control, can't control, and will lose against. Sure, ban it. It just becomes the currency of the darknet. 
Look, I'll help you break down everything that is wrong in your paragraph.


Yes, you will let it fly free like the wind. Let's see how you plan to do that.


You're going to make it safer. With a government mandate. In order to execute that, government must be able to control where each one goes. 5 words in and we have already destroyed bitcoin, but let's continue. 


Custodians. Who is a custodian? I don't want any. I control my private keys thank you very much. Cheap hardware wallets will render most computer theft of bitcoin several orders of magnitudes harder before the year is over. The only safety that can come to traders/exchanges from a government mandate is a law leaving them the hell alone. MSB registration and reporting is ridiculous and obsolete.


Ah, so now we're price fixing. That sounds very feasible on a fixed monetary supply. Oh, you really need to solve this problem though, lets put some trusted people in control of the mining rate. That sounds grand.


More laws on types of allowed trades, additional restrictions on American exchanges, and you're wondering why all the largest ones are overseas?

It basically means, for now, that you can accurately keep track of shares without a middleman. The share issuer can still be shady as fuck and scam you. 
It is a drop-in replacement for havelock investments, at this point. More uses are on the way but that is what it is useful for today.

That was very well written and a pleasure to read. Contrast it with the majority of top-rated circlejerk material in this thread.
My issue though is with the insurance angle. The insurance industry is probably the most regulated industry in the world (I'm a layman). There is no way they are touching bitcoin without government approval and probably new legislation. You can't run from government to the arms of insurance, because both are effectively the government.
The other issue with insurance, the only technical way that I know of for the insurance to actually control the flow of coin is multisig transactions. That could be as simple as each wallet on say a web wallet is a 2 of 3 wallet: customer company and insurance. 
What about cold storage, you would need an unaffiliated customer advocate agency with a key, the company and the insurance. Your web of trust is expanded drastically by this change, but now 2 of these 3 entities can cut and run. 
All of that combined, it can work. However there is an additional cost invoked by directly involving insurance in every single transaction. That extra cost is significant, rivaling even strict government regulations. It's no magic bullet, even given an ideological bias against the other option.
@_date: 2014-03-02 10:26:26

That seems as if the issue stems from ludicrously low block confirm times leading to a high chance of contested blocks.

You're likely running 1-2 miners on an existing circuit in your garage.
Just because you already own/pay for those things doesn't mean they're free for mining, there is the opportunity cost of not using that space for other things. For example you could have a woodshop using that space.
If you priced out that spot in your garage, your time for running it, time use on that circuit, I'm fairly sure that a larger operation will have less cost per hash.
That said, it is hard to compete against people operating at a loss/ignoring other costs.

So, hardfork and all that entails, then the bot maker just changes the code a bit. Still annoying if it's a soft fork or update. Any censorship formula is also problematic.
I'm not willing to do that since it only harms us and mildly inconveniences the bot writer.

Eventually. On the order of decades. 
The main thing here is the cost of labor, since both we and the rest of the world have the natural resources to produce (roughly). It is far cheaper to produce in a country with people willing to work for a buck a day and no safety regulations compared to the federally mandated 7 bucks an hour.
Now I'm not arguing for a removal of the minimum wage or the repeal of environmental/safety laws. I'm glad we have them. However there is the logical consequence that businesses will move overseas to where it is cheaper to operate.
The only thing the US can do is produce more advanced goods or sell service/information things that require high skill. We're doing that, but eventually we will likely lose that advantage.

You're a moron. The ideal bitcoin mining ecosystem is about 8 pools at 10% each and then a bunch of smaller ones filling in the tail. Participation in pools is voluntary and is your hashvote for that pool's mining policy.
If every miner was individually rewarded in every block, you would need to raise the size limit before even considering including useful transactions instead of just the bookkeeping.

Infationary systems emphasize investing and disincentivize saving in the currency. Bitcoin emphasizes saving for the reasons you posted. That means that investing will be harmed, but only to a 1-2% degree. Investments expected to pay above that will still happen, so overall the system becomes riskier for the greater payout, with the floor minimum of holding and getting indexed economy rate. Hopefully that means more prudent or better supervised investments instead of housing derivative gambling made easy by money flooding in.

Owning a 1 or 10 dollar hardware wallet(future pricing) and internet access gives you access to easy money transfers anywhere. Compare that to the existing unbanked percentages where people are dependent upon cash and barter.
It's not a magic bullet, but bitcoin will eventually improve the situation of the unbanked.

Welp, I disagreed with you. Better call me a troll, that will put me in my dissenting place.
If you stalk someone's post/facebook history enough to prove that they spend 8+ hours a day posting only negative things about bitcoin, good for you. You probably found an actual shill. Now you can call him/her out on it, probably get banned on reddit for doxxing, and make them burn their identity and start over. 
Now try calling someone a shill without proof. Does that go over well?

Now compare to His lowest tip is 10 dollars. He gains little to no karma for each post, barely anyone knows who he his. I remember him because he tipped 100 dollars to a homeless shelter. That is, in my opinion, an actual tipper. His only goal is giving to people he thinks deserve it.

You should be relieved. If there was one or two altcoins, then that means nobody found bitcoin interesting enough to experiment with it.
If there was none, that means that bitcoin is closed source and unable to be trusted.
Bitcoin is secure in it's place because of the network effect and technological advances. It has the most users, exchanges, services, developers, etc. It is also the only one that has found a purpose beyond get-rich-quick mining and pump and dump trading imo.

I can see your next point, why attack altcoins when what is good for one is good for the other? Because it isn't true. A successful currency is stable and has a large monetary base. A larger market is a more stable one. If you want to actually see cryptocurrency succeed, you would only financially support bitcoin. Altcoins were interesting tech proving grounds, but that use is now/will be soon irrelevant with sidechains.

Alright, I guess I can overlook that since they do accept bitcoin. Let me keep reading.


Dogecoin was founded on the idea that a digital currency should be fun and friendly, and we believe this ideal fits in very well for an in-game currency. 
Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin's value is much less than a dollar, which makes it better suited for a game currency. It just feels better to get paid 1000 Dogecoins rather than 0.001 Bitcoins. 
Dogecoin transactions are much faster than Bitcoin (~8x faster) and Litecoin (~2.5x faster). This means that putting money into your account or sending money from your account will be much faster. 
Dogecoin has support from many currency exchanges so you can easily convert Doge into the currency of your own country. However, we would encourage you to check out Dogecoin services online that will accept Dogecoin directly!
Maybe next time try supporting all cryptos instead of shitting on one to make another seem better. Your arguments are terrible and I will not play your game.

Side chain: An alt chain that does not create it's own units. Units are created by a special transfer from bitcoin. The ratio would be set by the creator of the sidechain, if you send 1 bitcoin to newsidechain you get 1000 newsides. And then you can send 1000 newsides back to 1 bitcoin.

Yes. The side chain holds no value of it's own, it uses whatever novel tech it has and the bitcoin market value.
How 2 way pegging works, the short version: magic, you can just use bitcoin or the alt chain interchangably.
The long version quoted: 
1. to maintain the 21m coins promise, you start a side-chain with no
in-chain mining subsidy, all bitcoin creation happens on bitcoin chain (as
with 1-way peg).  Reach a reasonable hash rate.  (Other semantics than 1:1
peg should be possible, but this is the base case).
2. you move coins to the side-chain by spending them to a fancy script,
which suspends them, and allows them to be reanimated by the production of
an SPV proof of burn on the side-chain.
3. the side-chain has no mining reward, but it allows you to mint coins at
no mining cost by providing an SPV proof that the coin has been suspended as
in 2 on bitcoin.  The SPV proof must be buried significantly before being
used to reduce risk of reorganization.  The side-chain is an SPV client to
the bitcoin network, and so maintains a view of the bitcoin hash chain (but
not the block data).
4. the bitcoin chain is firewalled from security bugs on the side chain,
because bitcoin imposes the rule that no more coins can be reanimated than
are currently suspend (with respect to a given chain).
5. to simplify what they hypothetical bitcoin change would need to consider
and understand, after a coin is reanimated there is a maturity period
imposed (say same as fresh mined coins).  During the maturity period the
reanimation script allows a fraud proof to spend the coins back.  A fraud
bounty fee (equal to the reanimate fee) can be offered by the mover to
incentivize side-chain full nodes to watch reanimations and search for fraud
6. a fraud proof is an SPV proof with a longer chain showing that the proof
of burn was orphaned.

Transaction malleability only matters if you're writing programs that naively depend upon the provided transaction id as an ironclad guarantee. Improperly written software was used to defraud/steal from mtgox. People would request a withdraw, change the ID, then file a ticket with mtgox "Hey my coins never went through" even though they did. Since mtgox's software only checked the ID, it didn't have the transaction on file. Malleability does not give you the ability to invalidate transactions at will, but does make it never a good idea to accept a chain of unconfirmed tx.
For the risks on accepting 0-conf transactions read  and  and pay particular attention to the mitigation techniques and the cost of attacks. The ones that are trivial to execute are trivial to defend against, check out the mycelium wallet and it's transaction confidence feature. More sophisticated attacks depend upon collusion with a pool and/or paying them to hold a block in reserve. That costs at least 25 bitcoin/$17k to execute, and that's a 10 minute window. Not something that is happening for a burger, and that's why exchanges require the full 6 (dunno where you got 7 from) confirmations.
The walkout part is in reference to the minimum amount of trust restaurants must place in their customers. They also have to extend more trust when they take cash, credit, checks and to a lesser extent unconfirmed bitcoin.

It's cheap advertising for a competing cryptocurrency in the bitcoin subreddit. That 30 cent tip is in bitcoin, you can assume someone in the bitcoin subreddit actually wants bitcoin.

I'm apparently one of the only people that recognizes how obnoxious and underhanded it is. I get comments like yours because hey, they're doing a good thing! ugh. 
In addition, being tipped in doge means the recipient has to spend their own time to learn about doge and at the very minimum register on an exchange to get it into something they want. Or they hold and that's another win in the tipper's eyes. Tipping trivial amounts is a win/win/win situation for the tipper.

I plugged $250 and 10 years into an inflation calculator for the cpi  and it spat out 300.46. So if inflation keeps about the same, bitcoin will have appreciated a bit at 400. It's no moon, but not a death knell either.

Except it has a competitive advantage, even taking into account dual currency conversion.
Something like western union has to comply with regulations in both countries to make the A -&gt; WU -&gt; B conversion. Bitcoin companies can be completely disconnected or compliant in both, depending on their business model. So a bitcoin remittance service can be A -&gt; bitcoin then a separate entity can do bitcoin -&gt; B. So the one company only has to comply with local regulations and can be smaller with lower fees or entirely digital. 
Companies like  handle both ends, but use cheap bitcoin transactions in the middle to gain a competitive advantage over competitors.

The 1-2% was base inflation. That's the amount of "free leeway" an investment is given, since a -1% inflation-adjusted investment will look attractive to people if it is ironclad safe. 
I was wrong with the derivatives thing. I was mistaking that with the overall market inflation of people holding safe mutuals/indexes in lieu of cash, because being fully exposed to inflation in the long run is suicide. I do think that giving everyone a way to access the indexed economy rate by default for free is a good thing.

Segwit effectively gives LN transactions a 75% discount with pay fee per byte combined with most signatures removed from that byte calculation. A 75% discount is not required to operate LN and it is most likely an innocent oversight when the primary concern is scaling.


 Blocks are full today. Bitcoin is operating at maximum transaction processing capacity right now. The only way for bitcoin to grow is now by bumping off lower fee transactions. Segwit and LN are 6 months away. If you don't classify that as a problem we have axiomatic differences on what bitcoin is.

Regulation total ban: Other cryptos will probably be targeted by the same sweeping law.
Regulation greenlisting: Yes, we will need zerocoin when/if this happens.
Core/protocol Technical: Bitcoin has the most paid devs (only that 1 litecoin guy outside of bitcoin) and the most active contributors. If anyone is going to solve a tech problem first, it's bitcoin. As the others are simple copies for the most part, the same issue will effect the rest of them.
Implementation Technical: This is where you may have the most pull with wanting multiple coins. However my point of the developers and contributors still stands and bitcoin will likely solve it first.

Under what timeline is a meaningful transaction capacity increase by any method active in two months, march 21st, in the core scaling plan?


Correct. It also makes absolutely no sense to hysterically declare any block size increase as impossible, especially in the face of the ecosystem saying that the increase is acceptable and some saying it's preferred. I'm also not encouraged by your lack of assuming good faith, that I'm not taking the risks into the equation.
The issue I was addressing is the axiomatic, fundamental, basic assumptions of what bitcoin is. You are dismissive of full blocks as a problem, even using scare quotes with them. I am surprised that a significant if possible minority of users shares your stance, as mine is that bitcoin must scale first (safely) and a natural fee market grows at some point in the future, not capping bitcoin at 2.48 tx/sec and force a premature bidding war.

Political centralization is the worst form. It's only tolerable when they actually listen to the constituents, aka economic majority.

Basically people are searching for a reason why there is no scheduled block size increase despite it's urgency. They found core devs trumpeting early fee markets and rolling out radical code changes that while amazing, will not deploy in time to alleviate fee pressure. They found core supporters looking at charts like [this]( and exclaiming that blocks are not full, therefore there is no emergency. Regular people looked at that chart and reasonably extrapolated from that and current core roadmaps and concluded there is a significant risk of impaction. 


It honestly depends on your definition of reasonably informed. Personally I've been around bitcoin since 2011 and do not think there is a socially engineered conspiracy or corporate takeover. I do think they have simply failed at/given up communication with the community, both in getting their views across clearly and listening to what the community has to say. For that reason classic is welcomed. 
If you back off on your threshold of reasonably informed, then blockstream's motives are unclear (who gave them this money and why), their origins and loyalties are suspect, and their obsctructionism and dismissal of this issue is grounds for new governance. 
The recent medium article of "the announcement that should have been" is a great example. It showed understanding of the issues, clearly conveyed why their solution will work, and compromised by including a fork. The real announcement reeked of "my way or the highway" and had a tone of dictating policy from on high, with a side of the one holy interpretation and take my ball and go home threats.


Core/Blockstream's largest failure in this entire mess is their tacit approval of the horrendous censorship occurring in this subreddit/bitcointalk/bitcoin.org. The instant XT was declared an altcoin, core should have loudly and publicly denounced Theymos. I can confidently state that /btc XT and classic would not have had nearly the success they do if not granted the validity of censorship.

Don't worry, I'm a certified wordsmith.


Now we have the question, why bitcoin instead of an altcoin? IMO there are three reasons. Network effect: where bitcoin is valuable because you can send value with it because it's valuable. Technology: bitcoin has the biggest and best crypto dev team in the world. Userbase: everyone uses bitcoin because everybody uses bitcoin, closely tied to network effect. 
If a network effect primacy is lost, it will regain it's place or a new one will emerge. Pretty much the highlander. In this case I think it will remain firmly with the winning fork unless ~~corestream~~ the losing side completely loses their collective shit and embarks on a holy war of bad PR for "failed" bitcoin.

That's a failure condition. Also I'll spoil the fee market conundrum for you: we have one already. What running into the blocksize limit does is impose an artificial cap on supply, while demand can still fluctuate. The simple relationship of more people using bitcoin -&gt; more txns shows that the inverse is also probably true. All the arguments I've heard in favor of snubbing sub dollar transactions either presuppose a working LN or are blatantly elitist.

Some fee pressure is indeed ideal and what we have today with orphan risk. I wasn't precise enough in my terminology. I was referring to the point where the block size limit is consistently reached and transactions become severely or even indefinitely delayed, and fees skyrocket. Such an economic event was detailed by gavin in the early calls for additional blocksize.


it's supposed to transfer gradually to miners being mostly for transaction fees. That's all the whitepaper says. I would vastly prefer for that need to be met with many many small fees instead of a few huge ones, and I think most people feel the same.

That's not happening at all. Bitcoin works because we pay the miners to secure our chosen rules, not because some group of developers has decreed it to be so.


Only incompatible because one side has forced it to be so. If the core scaling plan was released as it is now but also had a 2mb or 2-4-8 hardfork scheduled right now I would love it. I still expect most of it to be implemented and look forward to LN. (edit:wording)


Not possible, because miners are conservative. They will Identify the winner and jump on that bandwagon within 24 hours, otherwise every mismined satoshi is an operating loss they have to eat.


Consensus behavior has changed after they deprecated openSSL and changed the database format. I don't see how this is applicable as this would indeed be a blockchain fork and not a P2P network fork. 


No, it will be a classical blockchain hardfork. Miners building off of block A will have fundamentally non-mixable UXTO with miners building from block B. If miners stick around on core (which I don't think they will) then your nodes and the core network will continue working.

A 99.5% loss in value prediction means you are either accurately predicting the surviorship of the core fork, or based on your 8$ classic fork you have the worst case of FUD I've seen. The sky is simply not falling.


The problem with that is the adjustment period. Given those ratios, and assuming a difficulty adjustment at forkblock-1, core miners would receive 25 btc every 50 minutes for 10 weeks. The current transaction load ( which already exceeds capacity  will necessarily have to drop by 5x those 10 weeks. With 20% of previous revenues on a network with 20% of previous operating capacity for 10 weeks at the minimum, and unchanged operating costs, all miners attempting to stick with core through the fork will go bankrupt or capitulate. If even one miner capitulates or goes bankrupt the above numbers skew even further against core. There's always the possibility of a 51% attack but it won't be necessary because of economics.


It does, because you have to modify your software in order to validate the change. This side debate is also not as productive as the main one, if you could summarize the main point to be taken away from it I would appreciate it. Yes I was wrong on the BIP66 debate.

Before I go line-by-line, let me lay out how I would prefer power to be distributed.
Most preferred: Nobody has power - economic majority (financial systems only) - everybody has power - some people have power - one person has power: Least preferred.


Consensus is a combination of opinions that matter, or another word for politics aka distribution of power. If you're laboring under the impression of pure technical merit for consensus, please pay more attention. Small blockers have a consensus, large blockers have a consensus, theymos has a consensus, everyone does for whatever group you define. Now our question is what the political system is for bitcoin. For development it had been an oligopoly, social media ownership a monarchy. You advocate for 95% hypermajority for all changes and are quite simply in the real minority in feeling this way. 


Reframed politically: There is a legitimate uprising that I do not like. One mans terrorist is another mans freedom fighter. I also find it highly amusing that a small blocker believes his side is not benefiting heavily from theymos' social manipulation.


Agreed! The wonderful part of bitcoin is abandonment of force. 


Satoshi (praise be upon him) gave us just such a method for resolving a conflict of interest: outcome-dependent Bribery. The currency that can pay the most value to it's miners is the big dog in the world and wins the crypto wars. Value -&gt; Hashrate -&gt; PoW -&gt; 51% those you don't like. That is the realpolitik fact of who controls cryptocurrency. Extending that, the most valuable crypto is the one that can afford payouts to buy the biggest and baddest miners, attracting and keeping it's economic majority via features. So the economic majority coalesces on a crypto and pay miners to enforce their chosen rules. Buy the yachts, call the shots.
That is how "substantial agreement" is determined. Not what you think, not what I think, not what blockstream thinks, not what satoshi thinks, not what reddit thinks. In this case everyone is still playing nice and indicating one preference or another before executing a 51%. 


Allow me to translate. "I am against the idea of economic majority having power in my given crypto, and wish for power to be given to this group instead. Please be scared of this unrelated example of power distribution" 
If you truly disagree with the rules the miners are enforcing, exercise your economic power. Sell bitcoin and buy something else. 


True. Not everything is directly controlled. 


And I wish that instead of trying to limit bitcoin, small blockers would make an altcoin instead of changing the fee landscape of my chosen crypto.


Absolutely nothing. Hardforks are how bitcoin is really governed. 


Here's that wonderful part of no force: you can get out! Sell your bitcoin for literally anything else. Advocate for a fork to a different PoW algo, take your genesis block and go home. Forks are fundamentally good because they allow separate expression of what rules you prefer. At first I was mad about your slippery slope argument of infinite inflation, but as I was typing the rest of this post, I realized there is no reason to be. Infinite inflation preferrers are free to do whatever they want. I'm free to ignore their blocks. 


What you are asking for is a system that enforces 95% hypermajority in hostile conditions. That simply does not exist. The best we have is enforcing a 51% majority in hostile conditions.


I'm sorry. But that isn't how the world works.
What bitcoin fundamentally brings to the table is 51% resolution without literal bloodshed.

so for 8 hours to be worth 7.99 in one day, that's .125% interest a day. Simple extrapolation (not APR) puts that at 45.6% inflation.

A high hashrate is only necessary to be decentralized. If you are going to be centralized, use a traditional database that is much faster and more efficient.

Did you not get what he just said? There is more to scaling than updating one number. For example, it was too time-costly to verify blocks for some miners, so they SPV mined as to not lose out on the block reward. That is something we absolutely don't want happening because it means the miner is not actually verifying anything.
tl;dr I support the block size increase but it is not a simple switch to flip.
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:29:24
Might as well not bother at that point. Mike, you're asking people to show a political stance by siding with XT over core. Let them actually make that choice over the block size issue alone, instead of introducing the confounding variables of the other changes in XT.

Have you considered that people don't run nodes because it chokes their entire upload pipe at random? 
It's far more user friendly  to allow upload caps at 4.5 mbit of their 5 mbit upload speed. Bittorrent appreciates every bit of upload we can throw at it, and I don't think it's correct on it's face that bitcoin is the opposite. We would need a study, decentralized user friendly nodes vs keeping up with propogation. 
It's my opinion that not having the option to limit upload speed is what stops the majority of eligible (reasonably used PC and residential connection) users from running full nodes.

Well as we're talking about Ad replacements, my idea is you have a small fund of bitcoin in a browser plugin or integrated into the browser. Then if you go to youtube it will prompt your brower for the fee and if it's below your autoaccept threshold the video starts playing. If it's higher than you're comfortable paying automatically it prompts you "pay x bits/pay x cents to watch this video?"
Paying would be good for x hits or page hours or some other metric on sites more complex than youtube. 
No need to involve a third party, just you bitcoin and the site.

If it is actually deployed and used and forks the network (as opposed to the mere threat forcing change), then bitcoin-core will have to move to the larger blocks as well. Then you could swap back to core. Core if ousted will not do a 3+month reorg and go back to 1mb after the network has been on 2mb+. 
Personally I don't think it will come to that, brinkmanship and laziness will probably end with a 2 or 4 mb increase. Then LN will be deployed and everyone's happy, despite the FUD being spewed about it now.

You're not taking into account the testing and deployment lag necessary for a hard fork. Look how bad bip66 has been and that was non-controversial.
If I'm reading you correctly on "when it needs to" that is the point at which the pain of having a too-small blocksize limit is evident. So 3-6 months after the pain point we are still on 1mb.
If you would argue that "when it needs to" points to 6+ months before it is needed, welcome to the debate as of today.

Also, when you say 2.31 per btc, are you looking at the far right value? It's accurate, but the net $/month is probably what you want to consider as your bottom line.

People fear what they cannot understand and there's no doubt about it, you need a certain level of intellect to be able to understand how Bitcoin works and more importantly why it works the way it does. And when people can't "get it" they get pissy and throw a tantrum just like a spoiled brat would when he's not getting the candy he demanded from his mother in the supermarket.
What repels people is actually this attitude. "Oh, you don't understand bitcoin? You're not worthy to clean my shoes."

Granted, not the most reliable company by any measure.


Additional to that is the difficulty can only adjust by a max of 4x either way which occurs roughly every two months.
Wrong. From the [bitcoin wiki:  ]( 


First off, it adjusts based on # of blocks. If 200 Thash/s is dumped on the network instantly, it adjusts faster than two weeks. It would 4x difficulty jump twice in a row in our hypothetical instant increase and both of these jumps would be less than a week apart.

GPU mining is barely, barely profitable depending on your electricity costs and economy of scale. A single GPU burning away on residential electricity is barely profitable. A setup on business electric rates, with 4 cards per mobo etc etc, will make a very decent buck until october.
ASICs are coming in "october" which really means october-january. Current estimates put the amount of ordered asics at enough to have the difficulty be about 20x what it is now. The block reward halving is coming up in december. Basic economics, supply gets cut in half, demand stays static (assumed), therefore the price doubles. So in the tool I have left the price as it is today, since the tool assumes 50btc per block.
[Here]( is my estimate for future profitability. This is assuming the 20x difficulty increase, and buying an SC single and guessing at it's power consumption which will probably be less than 80 in reality.

So in the immediate term, you're correct. However long term, the people that believed in the 21 million will  bring the original chain back per my post. It will be tough, but miners are not a monolithic block that runs their stuff for free. The economic reward is the ultimate goal, remove that and they come back to serving the economic side.

It doesn't even have to be a monetary policy. Bill Gates and IBM are in love with "blockchain technology" explicitly because it solved the problem of decentralized consensus. A ton of smart people are trying to replicate it without needing to basically bribe honest peers to stay honest.

How about a coin where a panel of active cryptographic researchers picked who could use it and why?
No, the best system is an open system. Everyone is invited, generate your public/private key pair to the left. Innovate and it will be included, open a business if you want, comply with local laws if you want, but everyone is equal on the network.

If we could have decentralized consensus without a currency that would be awesome as well. A currency would probably exist alongside/on top of such a system anyway, but would not be necessary for it's continued existence. 
The problem is that such a system does not exist. The pseudo-bribing method of keeping honest nodes honest is the key to making bitcoin work. There are many projects out there trying to solve the problem. I don't know if there is a way to solve it without financial incentive.
But bitcoin works right now, today. It is forging the future by continuing to exist. It is intrinsically linked to decentralized consensus, neither can exist without the other. That is why bitcoin has value.

Here's the solution you are talking about: 
It only works when less than ((n-1)/3) out of n nodes are malicious. There is no inherent incentive system or prevention system to stop attackers from joining the network. Any add-ons to the system like relying on DNS or the CA/PKI system can be exploited easily because they are centralized.
So tell me, how would you solve byzantine fault tolerance in a public system in the face of an attacker without using a blockchain and PoW? There is the problem he solved.
He created the need to solve a problem? Nope, the need has always existed and was going unfulfilled. This is why craigslist exists despite eBay, uber/lift/sidecar exist despite traditional taxi companies, and why airbnb exists despite hotels. That is the need that he did not create, it's the need he fulfilled. It's not an overwhelmingly large need as traditional centralized currencies mostly do it right, but it does exist.

That's not true. Mining does not generate the value, economic use does. In your case, the holders and payment gateways don't upgrade, a hard fork occurs. The nascent 21 fork would use very little mining power but eventually separate and gain their own. The 42 fork value would trade freely against the 21 fork and the value would stay with the 21, the 42 fork mined coins become worthless.

OB is obviously not ready for primetime, and it's a little unfair to compare it as of right now. But you don't have to use ebay/openbazaar exclusively, say someone writes software to simultaneously list on both at once. Sure ebay will have more sales, but if the sale happens on OB then hey you save 9% so there's no reason not to dual-list.
What happens when the money keeps talking and 5/10 years down the line both systems have comparable numbers looking at them? Only at that that point would it be viable to move to OB exclusively. 
It's basically the same argument as why use bitcoin at all when it has very low internal fees but high fees and annoyance when converting to fiat. It's simply more efficient to participate in the long run, with some cases where it is more efficient right now.

Implementation problems are not existential problems. Casual consumer use of bitcoin does depend on cheap hardware wallets to do all the security for them, because most people's computers are a virus infested scrap heap.
We have the wallets, but they're not cheap and easy enough for mass usage. 
Coding a website or payment processor or exchange is a serious undertaking that has not been given due consideration.  Most programmers implement crypto systems badly and should under no circumstances write their own. Websites should be using bitcoin handling software written by actual experts and secure their keys on hardware wallets with multisig or other similar hard security measures. Everything seems secure until proven otherwise though, so this will continue being a problem while people use businesses without good security.

You're not understanding the core concept here. I am trying to help but I need to go to bed after this, so this is the last one.
If you have a 100 btc stash and the definition is changed, now you have 10 btc and the phone is 1 btc and you can buy 10 phones. The definition changes tomorrow, you now have 1 btc and a phone is .1 btc, you can still buy 10. This is because the definition of the unit has no impact on the total value of bitcoin. Now if you understand that and are frustrated that I am missing the point, you are probably talking about deflation which is a totally different topic.
edit: think of your stash not as "100 btc" but as your fraction of the total bitcoin value which does not change.
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:47:28
Or the other classic: Finally, corruption that benefits me!
@_date: 2015-03-11 06:37:18
Thus why I used the analogy. Let's assume for a moment that the total value invested in bitcoin doesn't change.
This total value should be split up into exchangable tokens that have values that we can easily comprehend for every day purchases. We can make it so a burger costs 5 bits, or that same burger costs 500 bits. The total value of bitcoin and the burger is not changing, so only the denomination amount is changing. You are not creating or destroying wealth, you are simply defining where units of wealth are made unique and separate (discrete).

@_date: 2015-03-11 06:08:16
If the definition of "BTC" went through a 10x merge, there would then be a maximum of 2.1 million and your phone would indeed be worth 1 btc. This is also why we don't mess with the base unit, we introduce new smaller ones like "bit". 
The overall number of 21 million will not change, you seem to be confusing label changes with inflation/deflation.

Lack of maximum upload bandwidth configurable limit. 
This should be fairly basic stuff, like a torrent client.

Basically, Coinbase decides if you can move your bitcoin. Therefore you don't *really* have bitcoin, you have coinbase-IOUs that are exchangeable for bitcoin, for now. 
To truly own bitcoin is to be the only person in possession of your private keys, so you have full control of your funds.

this is the first PR in a planed series of bandwidth / DOS prevention PRs.
Focus for now is a simple and not over-complex solution to start with.
The -maxuploadtarget (in MiB) is a configuration value that make bitcoind try to limit the total outbound traffic. Currently there is no guarantee that the limit target will be fulfilled.
If the target-in-bytes - (time-left-in-24-cycle) / 600 * MAX_BLOCK_SIZE is reached, stop serve blocks older than one week, stop serve filtered blocks (SPV) immediately.
The timeframe for the measurement is currently fixed to 24h.
This is a effective method of reducing traffic and might prevent node operators from getting expensive "traffic exceed"-bills.
Currently the limit also take effect for whitebinded peers.
Over getnettotals one can get some upload limit statistics:
Awesome! This is what will make regular core usage viable again!

Show and generate addresses
Share the same wallet.dat as your home computer, maybe an option to quickly transfer between the two if separate for security reasons.

I know it sounds dumb/anecdotal and I might be exposing my age here, but my personal experience with the word virtual and pretty much anyone I've talked to about it has that 'fake' definition.
It's similar to the dictionary definition, but with more falsity. "We saved virtually all the frogs" "2015 is virtually the year of the linux desktop." It can also be taken to mean "inferior copy".
Also making paper bitcoin to use as a currency is dumb as hell. It works pretty well for cold storage, but all the paper ultimately does is serve as a storage device for the private key; the bit of digital information that actually controls the actual bitcoin sitting on the blockchain. So I disagree with him that bitcoin can be made into paper money.

Yes. This is literally what they are doing. They did it to me as well. When they ship, ***REFUSE TO SIGN FOR THE PACKAGE***. If you sign for the package, you accept the business agreement/transaction legally.

Since all that is needed to transact and store bitcoin is the private key (which is information), any method of moving that works. This is why you can have brainwallets, hardware wallets, offline wallets, etc.
Specifically what you were saying with the signing of offline transactions, what happens is you craft a transaction, apply the private key to it to prove you own the bitcoin being moved. Then you take that signed transaction, and move it to a different computer to broadcast to the network.

Advantages? None. It's a shitty coat-tail chasing alt chain for butthurt GPU miners and people hoping to be an early adopter since they "missed the train" on bitcoin. The reasons:
1: Active development: Bitcoin has a full time paid developer and dozens of contributors. Litecoin has one part time developer.
2: Worse double spend protection. Yes you read that right. Protection from a double spend is a function of the hash power of the network. These are expressed in blocks, but blocks are only a unit of accounting and the actual security comes from the speed of the network. It takes 4 litecoin blocks to be as secure as one bitcoin block, IF AND ONLY IF the networks have the same hashing power. Since scrypt is intentionally designed to be hard to use on anything but a cpu (and then we cludged it into GPUs anyway) it intentionally limits the hash power of the litecoin network, lowering security. "faster confirmations" is pure placebo. If you're dealing with small amounts or dealing with someone in person, accepting a zero confirmation transaction is secure enough in both coins.
3: Fees. Litecoin has a very dumb fee structure of .1ltc per some amount of kbytes. At this point in time, some litecoin transfers are already prohibitively expensive. It is not "silver to gold" because it shares the exact same characteristics, except being worse at some.

It is necessarily true. The Economics of it is that given a widespread acceptance of x percent of all online purchases (for example, to set demand), then it must have at least y total valuation at z monetary velocity.

That's not really true in this case. You don't see a huge opium palace openly selling all sorts of phychedelics down the street. Similarly if bitcoin is banned, say goodbye to any hope for businesses accepting bitcoin.
edit: well, the nitpickers are here, I'll use little words. 
In america, you do not see a physical store selling illegal drugs. This is because they are illegal, and the government will come down hard on any business that starts to sell them.
Similarly, if bitcoin becomes illegal, no physical store and most online stores will not accept them because it is illegal to do so.

If you're sane, you pay off your credit card in full every month. 
In this way it is simply a proxy for your bank account, that happens to have some chargeback potential.
And you didn't answer the original assertion: that bitcoins can be used as a mask for dollars in the same way that credit cards can.
You instead changed track to be about ease of use and reliability. Bitcoin is difficult to use now, but that will be fixed in time. They are already very reliable.

Shorter confirmation times are not an advantage.
The network hashing power is the power against double spends. 4 confirmations on litecoin provide the exact same time and thus protection as one confirmation in bitcoin. In fact, it is less secure because it intentionally chose a proof of work algorithm that makes it more vulnerable to outside interests. 
Litecoin is just a fork for GPU miners and people who hope to catch another early adopter trend. I have no respect for it but it's probably not going away.

Let's take fish as an example. Lets divide up ownership of the fish in the ocean. Doing it geographically, I fish all the fish that swim by, stocks collapse, tragedy not solved. 
Divide up ownership by each fish? Impractical to track, and then I harvest all my fish, pocket the cash and move on to the next business venture. Tragedy not solved.
Have one entity own all the fish? They could manage stocks to provide the optimum amount of fish for everyone. Problem is how you change ownership of the coastal fisheries to this global organization, another is how to prevent local fishers from fishing without permission, and how to make sure that the small time guys can fish enough to subsidize. Tragedy kinda solved but has problems coming about under the libertine system.

Here's my money flow for usd: Job -&gt; bank -&gt; credit card -&gt; stuff. 
Yes, you can spend money you don't have. That is irrelevant to my usage of credit card as a proxy for dollars. I don't see any argument for it never being a proxy for dollars besides your unsupported assertion.
Alright, fine. You included volatility in your reliability assessment. I was referring to the protocol, but ok. Reliability in that regard will come with time and adoption. The magnitude of the 2011 bubble was higher than this one, and busted lower (though we're not done yet probably). Extend the trend, and bitcoin becomes more stable with more adoption (and thus time). Bitcoin must go through a transition phase of being a proxy for dollars until it gains enough value and marketshare and thus stability to have things priced in it. That is a very long term solution that will require bitcoin to mature a lot more.
We probably agree on everything except for the mask for dollars bit and are just arguing past each other.
@_date: 2013-03-13 22:18:03

Yep. The main disadvantage is time, which is money. If you own the subway, you have to train all of your employees for the proper procedures and buttons to hit to accept bitcoin and verify the transactions. You have to make sure they know them, and make sure that they keep knowing them next month. All of that is a very real time cost and thus real cost. Potential regulatory issues are also a disadvantage. Figuring out how to report and pay taxes on it is easy with a payment processor, but still something the owner has to think about.

Well, if bitcoin forces it's way into the global reserve currency, then the US won't be able to play such silly games with the dollar. It will weaken their ability to print out of nothing, they will have to back it up with real currency.
Bitcoin being widely accepted will enable mass tax dodging as well, which could further hurt the US's income. Now these things combined will impact any countries ability to use monetary policy and their income, but it doesn't necessarily mean the inevitable downfall of the state.

Right now, how the transaction fee works is that the devs set a value, and pretty much everyone pays it. It's a reasonable value, but that's not how it should work in the future.
How it should work in the future is a free market system, where there are relatively well defined fee brackets associated with how quickly your transaction will clear. If you want it in the next block you pay at least X, if you don't care when it arrives you pay between X and Y price.

If bitcoin becomes 6% more valuable every year, you can price your loan at -3% to make profit.

That's the thing. Making bitcoin illegal turns our current adoption cycle upside down and lowers adoption. And adoption is the main driver of price. It's a vicious circle both up and down.

These are excellent, and what alt chains truly should be for.
I'm sick of litecoin and the other dumb clones, bring on the innovation.
@_date: 2013-04-16 01:48:43
Reasoning behind 10 minutes: Yes, it's a happy medium. There is only a tiny overhead per block, so that isn't the main reason. The main reason is that when mining, you must work from the current valid block in order to produce a valid block yourself. Decreasing the time between blocks means that there is an increase of invalid blocks, and an overall increase in wasted miner time.
1-3 confirmation security: The network security is better off with a slower confirmation time as per above. For merchants accepting *coin, I must explain a bit more about bitcoin. Bitcoin nodes (not miners) only retransmit valid transactions according to their own rules. This means that a 0 confirmation payment, but one that has been relayed to you, means that it has passed basic sanity checking by the network. (that it's a valid private key, that it does access that much btc, etc) The reason behind waiting for multiple confirmations is the race attack, which is exceedingly difficult to pull off and completely not worth it if you are handling small amounts of money or you are physically present at say a restaurant.
Therefore, in situations where you accept less than 6/24 confirmations, you are just about as well off accepting 0 confirmations, as long as you don't connect directly to the potentially hostile user.
Arbitrage is a great thing, and is needed for the one price rule to happen. I don't really see how litecoin factors into it though.

The common solution for now due to the volatility is to use a payment processor that takes all the risk, and pays you directly in euros.
In the future when bitcoin is more stable, you will be able to price in btc and have a reasonable expectation that that will be accurate.

is a fixed fee for sending any amount of money to a registered user (up to 
the maximum limit of USD 460). In Tanzania the fee instead scales with 
the amount transferred. There are differences in pricing at different points 
between Safaricom’s and Vodacom’s M-PESA. It is much more expensive to 
send the minimum amount in Kenya but cheaper to send larger amounts. 
For the most popular amount sent, which is about 20 USD in both countries, 
Safaricom charges 3.6% and Vodacom 4.5% of the amount sent. The prices 
have been calculated to include the deposit fee (free), the transfer fee and the 
fee to withdraw the money. 
The actual cost of transferring money using M-PESA in Kenya and Tanzania 
is broadly similar and substantially lower than other alternatives. However, 
the slightly more complex sliding scale of charges used in Tanzania may have 
complicated the offer. Potential users need to have a clear understanding of the 
cost to compare it with other money transfer offers. If this comparison process 
is too complex it can deter potential users from considering a new service. 
Demonstrating usage cases with actual costs could help with this issue.

Control (and thus ownership) is equal to the control of your private key. If you do not have your private key on your own machine, you are trusting a service to keep it secure for you. There is no FDIC for bitcoin.

I assume you hold some bitcoin, so let's make an argument based on pure appeal to greed.
When you use language like that, you alienate anyone who reads it who does not 100% agree with you, and even some who do. If someone does not like what you say and they see that you support bitcoin, they will not support/use bitcoin. Bitcoin value is dependent upon the size of the economy which is based on the number of people. By using that kind of language you directly hurt bitcoin and thus yourself.

Capital-I Investors realize that bitcoin has a tiny market cap, is prone to bubbles, and are staying out unless they are purely speculating. Other investors like bitcoin enthusiasts, who knows.

Stability will come from adoption. This bubble was smaller than the 2011 bubble. The next one will be smaller still.
Inflation emphasizes investing at the cost of saving. Deflation emphasizes saving instead. I have seen arguments for and against. Deflation leads to less investing yes, but inflation leads to sub-prime lending and all the pitfalls associated with that. Psychologically, people prefer stuff getting cheaper to stuff getting more expensive. I don't think that will be a major issue besides most economists blustering at it.
Yes, early adopters gain. However, it is linearly not exponentially like an actual pyramid scheme. If bitcoin is a pyramid scheme, it is a strange one with only one layer. I consider that linear profit fair for investing in unproven internet funbucks. Note that early adopters sell when it's high, redistributing those coins into new hands. It's not going to come crashing down as they gradually cash out.

Alright, say a person holds 1000$ cash and 10 btc. He wants to buy a laptop. He has two choices, pay in dollars or bitcoins. His dollars will become less valuable over time, while his bitcoins will likely appreciate. 
If he buys a $200 laptop with cash, and bitcoin goes up a month later, he is in good shape. If he buys it with 4 btc and a month later btc is worth $100, then he has effectively lost $200 in profit from appreciation due to not holding bitcoin when they went up.

1 is the transaction ID.
2 is the change address. Every time bitcoin is sent, it is a best practice to empty the entire amount in one transaction, then send the remainder to another address you own. Makes it more difficult to track.

Storing mass amount of bitcoin on web services is a terrible idea. Secure users store their bitcoin offline or at the very least on their own hardware.
By adding the ability to monitor public addresses, you get 99% of the secure bitcoin holding usage you are aiming for.

That right there. You are implicitly accusing the reddit admins of arbitrary enforcement of their own rules. You also had the same kind of passive aggressive "this wouldn't be happening in a fair society" whining in the mail you sent the admins as your appeal. I hope you are also aware that even if they are arbitrarily enforcing, nothing in your correspondence to the admins has been professional or persuasive or attempting to get on their good side. Which is what you need if you wish to continue using a platform of millions of users for free.
Maybe but what you meant to write was "Please don't backslide into doing referrals again". Or maybe you actually meant "I hope they don't bother to look at us again even though we plan on breaking the rules". 
Oh, and here are some quotes from your mail to the admins.

A free market depends upon the free price system, which does it's job as well as the information surrounding it lets it. A large corporation under that system then has the means and the motivation to hide as much information as possible (and fabricate or exaggerate good information as an alibi) to get away with immoral activites. LIBOR and Enron would pale in comparison to what a smart corporation could really do.
I'm not sure which sort of voluntarist/law system you subscribe to, but courts, laws, and most importantly investigative power would be diminished by the degree to which it is anarchic.

I mean it's your right to run your site however you want, but you are seriously shooting yourself in the foot here.
So contrast that scenario with me instead playing at sealswithclubs on bitcoin tables. The exchange rate doesn't matter, because you buy in, play, and withdraw bitcoin. The other site has a competitive advantage over you, because users don't lose money if bitcoin goes up.
It's also not fair to subject users to bitcoin volatility on the basis of "well the usd/cad volatility isn't that bad". Huge swings will happen in minutes/hours, and your site will either be stealing or suckers from the perspective of your bitcoin customers.

Relaying and including in a block have the exact same checks because it's not computationally expensive to verify every transaction you relay. Yet. It is possible in the future for someone to make a blind-forward node, but that wouldn't be secure.

GNU comes along and copies all the functionality of the programs. (GNU stands for gnu is not unix) Under the GPL, they thrive. 
The one thing they don't have though, is a kernel. Along comes linus, plugs his custom kernel into the center of this fully working GNU machine, and we have a completely free OS.

It's already gambling enough to play poker, there is no need to add currency speculation.

@_date: 2013-04-04 05:00:58
Real advice: Bitcoin is volatile as fuck. Don't invest what you can't lose. If you are not a professional day trader, do not day trade bitcoin. If you believe in the long haul for bitcoin, use dollar cost averaging. If you only want to use bitcoin as a transactional agent, buy it with bitinstant when you need it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:06:27
And whatever improvements it has cannot be stolen by bitcoin, since bitcoin is in active development.

They are. They are doing it in a haphazard, outside of the law way.
Large banks will drop your account impersonally and without recourse. I can't even remember the dozens of bitcoin businesses that have gone under for this underhanded tactic. 
It is also doomed to fail as bitcoin businesses seek out banks more interested in profit than in maintaining the status quo.

@_date: 2013-12-23 20:43:16
That's very interesting. How would a bitcoin tree know if my transaction is valid though? You would have to have some way of cross-validating between branches, and you would have to implement some ironclad time mechanism besides block height.
I also don't see how this would reduce the size of the blockchain. I've heard of things like storing only unspent outputs or hashing the whole chain in SPV mode, but not what you are discussing.
Also, how would a miner determine which branch to mine on?
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:03:14

I'm all for bitcoin as much as the next guy, but the flat lies and misinformation quoted in the OP is frustrating. Bitcoin is gaining adoption and is still absolutely miniscule and insignificant in the grand scheme of things. Claiming that the existing world is crumbling because bitcoin is doing well is ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-01-28 20:16:21
Worked well until the last sentence. People will "deal with decimals" by trading in milliBTC and microBTC. If you have an idea to be rid of the blockchain and have a fully anonymous currency, feel free to share.

@_date: 2013-10-21 18:37:34
I disapprove of alt-coins that solely exist as pump-dump mining cash-in crap for people who are angry about not "getting in early" on bitcoin. 
I like altcoins that test new concepts and ideas.

But once it is established as this, what is stopping it from snowballing? People have heard of it, it's a reliable store and transmission of value, and is presumably easy and secure to use.

It's equally dangerous in the other direction as well. I'm not worried about you losing money, I'm worried about you and your customers.
I deposit 1 bitcoin. I play well and win 10% over 12 hours. Meanwhile the exchange rate rocketed up 50% overnight. I withdraw in the morning, how much bitcoin do I have?
The key issue is your auto-conversion from bitcoin to dollars back to bitcoin. It is not safe for anyone's value and can end up screwing over one or both parties. If that's not the case, please educate me.

Rising adoption drives demand up, increasing volatility. Volatility drives transactional use down, reducing demand.

There are **no large** bitcoin exchanges in the us **because the regulatory burden is too high**. If the standards were relaxed then an exchange would pop up overnight. I am arguing **for less regulation** from an economic perspective to boost bitcoin usage in the US.

You only have to report sellings. As in when you cashed out. There are multiple ways of reporting bitcoin income, and you're confusing capital investment/gains vs. treating it like income. Again, I'm not an expert and probably wrong.

You didn't hear it from me, but buying low and selling high is the latest craze.

Right there with the no-controls irreversible fiat transfers. Oh wait, all the fuss is because fiat is inferior to bitcoin and you can't have only a technical solution to this.
