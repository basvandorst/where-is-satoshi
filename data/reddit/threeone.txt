I'll post back whether I get it.

To be clear, I am working on a fast desktop (apple) and gave them many threads. They might be fine for other systems, but it didn't work well for me. I would try it again on linux.

Still nothing. Maybe I'll give it another day.

[ this one is a complete scam. I'd take it right off the listing if I were you. It might pay the bills, but where is that money heading? Not economical.

RollerCoin is fun and appears to be a product that allows you to participate in block creation before accumulating enough BTC to create an entire block. I'm wondering if it grabs the cert from your browser to sign...

Cudominer tricked me. Be careful. They spun out a few cores and failed to report it.
