Well, that's because it is.
Unless you are technologically impaired and can't see it.

I didn't say anything about taxes. Bitcoin protects you from the government randomly deciding that your savings are theirs. If you store your money in fiat in a bank, the government can simply take it. If you store it in fiat at your home, they can simply print more. If you store it in Bitcoin, they will have to come to your home and force you to handle it, and even in that case you might be safe if you have some kind of multi-sig or nLockTime protection in place.

Maybe you should have consulted with experts before saying something like that and endorsing two of the most scammy coins out there. You shouldn't pick coins by reading what their professional marketers wrote. Yes, they actually paid for marketing services.

You should talk about your ignorance on they might cure it.

Well my traditional money was in my traditional bank, all very "secure". Then one day I made no mistakes and it was moved into the government's pocket.

Don't tell, show.
Show your friends that you save in Bitcoin, and that your savings go up over time.
Buy more. A higher price makes Bitcoin a better store of value, more stable, more secure, and makes the news, which brings more savers, and so on.

This scheme is weird. Why do you want multi-signature if you keep enough keys in the same computer? Are you at least using full-disk encryption in case someone breaks in and steals your computer?
I think the easier scheme to understand and use is 2-of-3 (it doesn't even require full disk encryption):
- One key for your 3rd party service (eg: Coinkite, GreenAddress, BitGo, Bitalo, etc.)
- One key for your computer (if it's for savings, keep it offline! And obviously generate all the keys offline)
- One key in a physical location.
- Optionally have a backup of your computer's key in a second physical location.
This way you can set up withdraw limits in your 3rd party service, which keeps you safe from someone entering your home and forcing you to send him all your savings (because at home you only have one key). For that, he would have to force you to go and fetch one of the keys in the physical locations, which would be a lot riskier for him.
