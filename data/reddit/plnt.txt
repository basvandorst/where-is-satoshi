This is not directly related to Electrum but maybe you'll find it interesting. There is a service called [Touchpine]( which allows you to watch for updates and if available it provides you links to changelogs. It also gives you daily email notification if new version is available. You can check it out on  . If you find it useful, I'll be happy for your feedback!
