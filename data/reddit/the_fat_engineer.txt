Aren't we aiming for bitcoin to be the world currency used by masses? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:16:13
Thank you! 
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:17:15
Sorry for the click bait title. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:17:50
10 years? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:19:18
I know about atomic swaps, what are the other 2 techs? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:21:48
Thank You!
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:50:35
I think they do support segwit. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:12:10
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:22:38
I think you can look up number of active wallets. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:14:12
he must be new here
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:36:32
Wouldn't the lightening network result into more bank like organisations propping up?
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:48:23
Any way to create segwit paper wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:59:53

What are you even doing with btc if you don't know how to scan a public key? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:58:44
This is getting scary. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:03:51
That's why I got into crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:56:45
What are the combinations you've tried? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:03:39
By this rate it'll cross 13k by end of week. Or maybe it'll cross 13k by tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:31:52
Can be giant exchanges moving their money around.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:23:33
any update man?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:38:23
this is a empty one from the same batch with same password. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:38:25
This is the risk everyone keeps talking about before investing in cryptos.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:07:36
And what is the speed you get? Like how many guesses per minute? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:13:02
is there a option to receive btc in your coinbase wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:15:21
Man this is disheartening. :/ I wonder if my BTC are also going to be among those which are lost forever. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:53:49
I wrote this at the bottom of the page. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:11:26
It's written on the paper wallet. I don't have any photos of it as of now. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:53:08
I'm very sure. Because this is a password I've used previously. And have you tried everything? Uppercase, lowercase, missed type, missing alphabet, etc?
Thank you for trying. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:51:50
Lol. End of week. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:12:54
This is such a great explanation. Thank you. But wouldn't it be more like debit card 2.0?
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:43:04
I'm betting on BTC reaching $15k before 31st December. any takers?
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:49:15
any indication/evidence that this is happening? just curious.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:06:03
I always use an O
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:53:26
That guy didn't help. Said that it's too less for him. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:29:50
Here in India it literally takes 2-3 seconds for the money to show up in the receivers account, doesn't matter what bank the sender is using. If the money is sent via IMPS or UPI. both these options are universally available to everyone and are free to use. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:47:50
Yes. Exactly. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:50:24
Haha OK. How did you figure out the password at last? Did you try fOlder.xxxx from 0000 to 9999?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:43:01
No. I don't know any coding. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:21:51
Yeah fOlder.5649 is a old password I used to use back in the day. I started using fOlder.5645 fairly recently. I typed in the old password, wrote down the new one. 
Hey I know I shouldn't ask but can you just take 0.01 BTC instead of sweeping the whole wallet? I only had 0.1 BTC and that wallet had 20% of all my BTCs. Even if you take the complete amount it's cool. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:08:32
Nobody is using segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:10:48
What's even the point of that?

@_date: 2017-12-08 12:38:47
What were you thinking!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:52:36
is 0.01btc ok? I'll send that your way just email me send me your address?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:14:28
Do you anyone else who can help? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:11:39
You have to trust me on this one. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:42:51
hey it's solved. thank you for trying.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:36:24
why? you don't need the bounty??
@_date: 2018-05-21 10:15:11
10 minutes maximum. not average. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 10:59:09
a block is mined every 10 minutes. So 10 minutes is the maximum time someone have to wait for their transaction to be included in the next block not the average time. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:24:37
Take some profits out. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:11:40
some analogy about birds........
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:00:09
ELI5? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:34:17
How? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:03:52


@_date: 2017-11-29 08:55:12
Do you think it's a good idea to be giving all your details on reddit like this? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:20:45
Yes 9000 is expensive. Yes you should still buy more even at 9000. 
Because it going to cross 10k before December ends. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:39:33
Everything is less basic than food and water. And agreed that it is a first world problem, but a real problem indeed. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:33:31
ELI5 anyone? 
@_date: 2019-02-01 08:14:21
I did mean gigabytes. And the companies stay in business because the population density is pretty high. And the largest carrier in India is only maintaining 4g network, no legacy 2g or 3g networks. Data speeds are not very good though. But you get what you pay for. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:00:13
Basic smartphones are pretty cheap these days. And a basic necessity. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:40:28
Isn't buying drinks with bitcoins as same as buying drinks with gold coins? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:32:34
Do you see any of this changing in near future? And this bond dollar thing sounds pretty shady!
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:39:16
Is there any way to avoid taxes other than not making any money? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:59:42
When the prices are increasing and people buy because of FOMO. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:07:13
It has already crossed $9200 on Indian exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:03:51
how prevalent is bitcoin now in your country?
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:42:13
Thanks man! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:15:04
Now we should ask all the exchanges and wallets to use bits as the default unit of btc. 
@_date: 2019-01-31 11:11:17
I paid 1700INR or 24USD for 1 year of unlimited calls and 1.5Gb 4G data per day for my cell plan in India. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:03:26
Anywhere I can find that data?
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:51:53
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:21:27
sorry, i farted
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:26:51
OK. Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:22:48
How do you pay the sales tax to the government then?
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:47:42
My bad. Android.
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:47:09
First of all, thanks for the detailed advice. And I have one more question, what is this fork everyone has been talking about? And if I convert my bitcoins to Paper wallet how will that fork effect my bitcoins? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:33:29
Supply might be limited but there's no guarantee that the demand will be there forever. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:18:20
It did. to some extent. thank you. What would you suggest of the two: 
1) move to paper wallet before fork and deal with it on a later date?
2) move to paper wallet after fork?
@_date: 2017-10-22 09:11:51
Hey, I just started buying bitcoins. And as of now all my btcs are on the exchange. Is it safe for me to store them on a paper wallet generated by bitaddress.org? I'm looking to hold them for long time. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:10:25
Blockchain = internet.
Bitcoin on Blockchain is just like a website on the internet.
