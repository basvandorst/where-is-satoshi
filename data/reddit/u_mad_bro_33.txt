Yes, U.S. regulation is all about protection....but it's not about protecting you, the citizen, like they pass it off as.  It's about protecting THEIR financial interests (tax revenue, corporate profits, because let's get real....USA is just a corporation) and making sure the sheep don't become too independently wealthy and jump ship.  The wealthy won't work those menial jobs that are needed to grease the wheels of commerce and industry, they won't become indebted, causing them to work their little butts off to pay that 20% interest rate AND on top of that, pay those taxes like good little comrades. They want you to borrow money, become indebted and work your little heiny off for the benefit of your good ole' gubmint.    Bitcoin is a direct threat to that, it's like taking the red pill and unplugging from the matrix, because it represents a release from the greatest leverage the gov't has over it's citizens: financial control.

It  has demand as long as the buyer will pay the price the seller is asking.  It has value as long as there are buyers at ANY price.

It's all about measuring probability, nothing is for certain.  Oftentimes, I will put lines on all possibilities,  giving hints where the price may rise or fall.  The fact that it broke the line on one of the possibilities indicates that it was weak, therefore look for selling opportunities 
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:28:29
You put the line where there are at least 3 points of contact

Patterns happen in market price movements as can be proven by years of price data, whether it's stocks, pork belly futures or bitcoin...it's all driven by a mixture of supply and demand with a dose of human psychology (fear &amp; greed).  This can be somewhat predictable and can be acted upon as long as you understand you're dealing in probabilities.

WTF are you talking about?  I've bought airline tickets and graphics cards with bitcoin.  But that's beside the point....bitcoin's use case is value transfer OUTSIDE of the "global financial system".    That right there is what gives it value.

Call 'em stupid, but some people HAVE held thru all these crazy ups and downs, while only selling minimal amounts.  The people who sold at $32 back in 2012 had too much skin in the game or didn't believe.  When I first learned of BTC in 2011, I recognized it as the potential birth of a brand new asset class, so threw some "WTF" money at it to see what might happen.  Now I'm like, WTF looking at that $10k...  Smiling all the way...  HODL on!
@_date: 2018-06-29 21:23:53
You must be new here... since 2011, bitcoin has had multiple 75%+ drops.   One drop was close to 90%.  this is NOTHING.

How do you know?
@_date: 2019-08-04 04:48:54
The disturbing trend I have seen lately is people thinking a ponzi scheme is early buyers making money because demand by later buyers caused the price to rise, thereby enriching the early buyers...  That's not a ponzi scheme, that's just great market timing...       The ponzi scheme comes in when a central entity is paying early investors with late investors deposits and calling it a "market return".  There's a big difference.

No, it's the gambling.  If you send bitcoin from your coinbase account directly to a gambling site, they will eventually close you down.  It's in their terms of service.

Belief doesn't make reality.  Even if I believed BTC was going $0, I would STILL put in a dollar, because I know we're dealing in probabilities with a basically brand new asset class and I COULD be wrong.  The reasoning of the author is NOT ridiculous, it's brilliant.
@_date: 2018-07-01 15:43:24
Sounds like any stock/commodities market I've ever heard of!  Look at any stock/commodity chart and I bet you'll see "lowering and pumping prices all the time"  and a lot of wall street trading these days involves bots.  The only difference is, bitcoin markets are not currently regulated, so there's a bit of a "wild west" aspect to it.  But this is more a reflection of the exchanges scene right now and does not mean BTC itself is a Ponzi or scam
@_date: 2018-07-07 18:35:10
That's not the right way to look at it, because if fiat were extinguished, there would be nothing to measure it against.   It should be "what would one be able to acquire for a given amount of  bitcoin"  if fiat currency disappeared?    I would speculate in that case, you would probably be able to buy a comfortable 5000 - 10000 sq ft house for around .1 BTC or something close to that.   Anyone with 1 or more BTC would be super wealthy in the sense that they could acquire a lot of assets with a small amount of btc.

lol, "educate" people... You and that video are just repeating the status quo and assuming that because it exists and has operated as such for so long, that it must be the correct way for economic operation.   It IS the correct way for a certain subset of our financial system because it is incredibly lucrative, but for the rank and file consumer, the keynesian economic system is a complete disaster.   
The use of credit and the ability to print money, enables central banks to drive the economy beyond what it would be able to do without it , essentially creating a fantasy market and the illusion of prosperity.    It enables people and businesses to live beyond their economic means.  In such a system, spending is equal to borrowing, because the creation of credit, or debt, is what is necessary to keep the machine operating.   If spending (borrowing) slows, then the illusion and fantasy start to fade because new money is needed to pay the ever building debt created before it.   
Essentially the Keynesian system is a fucking ponzi scheme. 
Naturally, savers are frowned upon, because they are not participating in the creation of the credit so vital to this type of system.  
Ultimately, it's the spenders (borrowers) who suffer when the music stops (when the banks decide to contract credit), because they're the ones who are on the hook to the bank for their illusionary "prosperity."  Banks collect the assets (houses, cars, businesses) and then turn on the spigots of credit after a time, then the cycle repeats.
Easy Peasy

A ponzi scheme is a centralized scam run by a single individual or entity promising returns from some chosen investment method.  In reality, the returns are actually the deposits from new investors paid to the early investors.  As long as the inflow of funds is greater than the payments made, the game continues.   When the inflow dries up, the shop closes down and disappears, leaving a bunch of the newest investors penniless.  
This cannot happen in bitcoin.  It is run and operated by computer code on roughly 10,000 nodes all over the world and cannot suddenly be shut down.   You make or lose money in it from normal market movement, I.E. supply and demand.  The exchanges are really the only centralized risk involved with BTC; they COULD shut down and run with your money and have in the past.  But that's an exchange problem, not a bitcoin problem.
