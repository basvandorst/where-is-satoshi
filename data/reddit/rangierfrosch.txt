Isn't this just the total trading volume, as seen on bitcoinity.org? If so, effectively all of it is investors selling bitcoins to other investors. In fact, much of it is probably investors selling bitcoins to themselves, i.e. wash trades. It's not evidence that significant numbers of bitcoins are being spent to procure goods and services.

What? That makes zero sense. Trading volume is the amount of stuff changing ownership, regardless of means or methods, per unit time. This is true both in everyday colloquial usage and in technical dictionary definitions.
If you sell me a bar of gold, the gold trading volume goes up, right? The transaction does not magically only count if the bar is in some dodgy pawn shop somewhere and the proprietor changes the sticky note with the owner's name on it. The transaction absolutely still counts if it involves physically moving the bar from your house to mine.
Are you trolling, or are you just admitting there really is no evidence for any significant MoE adoption?

Yes, and? MoE how?

OK, so it really is just a total trading volume. The total trading volume visible on the blockchain. Includes investors moving coins into and out of exchanges, spreading asks around, or doing arbitrage. Also includes infrastructure upkeep, e.g. miners dumping coins to pay the electrity bill.
Is there *any* data on how much of this is actual MoE use?

Dude, I know that. And even if I didn't, how does any of this change the facts that (a) his private redefinition of "trading volume" is bonkers, (b) the chart does not actually show MoE activity?
