Sometimes it's ok to just admit Bitcoin isn't doing too well. Really. Believe me. 
@_date: 2014-12-24 22:53:50
Why exactly?

Delete the old wireless profile in the adapter settings. Or somewhere there.

Any idea how much is donated already? Are we talking about 100's or is this actually gonna somehow work and make someone "rich"?
@_date: 2014-12-24 15:41:41
100 bucks? Ok, i didn't expect much but that's just pathetic. 
So basically 99.9% of the people there want free money but refuse to pay even 1 dollar when they aren't picked. 
Good old Reddit community.

Indeed. Which is beyond me as well. Glad we agree. 
@_date: 2014-12-25 16:46:36
Well, to be honest in most situations this sure would look like it.

Just another alt coin scam. Just ignore them. These get rich quick fools will fall for it every time. One day they'll learn.

That's exactly what makes it so sad. That there seriously are people who spend their time downvoting worthless internet points is beyond me.

What part of my comment says this and what part of my comment is so wrong that it deserves to be downvoted?
Apparantly it's such a horrible comment that someone took the time to downvote my older posts as well. 
This place sure is something else.

You're right. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. It's doing amazing as everyone knows!
