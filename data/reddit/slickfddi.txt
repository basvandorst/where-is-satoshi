At my current electric rates, $0.10/Kwhr, that thing would cost almost $300 a month to run (if my math is right and I suck at math).

You ever wondered if the "I got rich on crypto and bought this" motif is more like an inside joke for the  wealthy? Like, you know, they got their money traditionally, inheritance, trust fund, earned it etc. but when they 'flaunt' how they got their money, it's "Crypto" (air qoutes, a sly smile and a snicker) because, really, except for a few, it's impossible to get rich on crypto.

Yeah I caught that on billions tonight but can someone ELI 5 how Bobby's going to be able to hide that transaction from the AG / SEC / IRS when he makes the USD/BTC purchase? What'd he say, half of his half so like a billion USD? Theoretically of course, for science
