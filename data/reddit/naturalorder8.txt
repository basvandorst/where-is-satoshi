Comical response, full of ignorance... 
This has nothing to do with hushmail, whether they are the FBI or what ever you think they are.  I have nothing to hide, if I did, I wouldnt be posting it on reddit.  launder drug money?  How does sending my bitcoin into an exchange to try and trade the market, then withdrawing the bitcoin constitute money landering?  (Seriously?)
 This situation has to do with btc-e.com's incompetence in changing my email, and its a warning for others in the bitcoin community as to not use btc-e.com

Its funny how bitter some of the reddit users are.  I lost $1300 and Im not even as bitter as some of the users.
So now trading bitcoins is looked at as gambling, great deal.
I am just poting this as a PSA for other people who are thinking about using btc-e.com
As one commenter said, they dont have the credentials to be trustworthy.
Taking all that into account, I have done nothing to deserve to lose my bitcoins, besides being a customer of their site and trying to change my email, which I then said no I do not want to change, and they changed it anyways and put a hold on the funds.  
Then because I complained so much, their course of action was to just suspend my account, in essence taking my money.
I just want people to know that your money is not safe with them.  I am not 'trolling', wtf?  Like Im asking for donations or something, seriously some people can be so bitter, LOL.
Im just trying to help others in the community, with knowledge about a scam.
And yes, obviously I get the point, I am unable to travel due to the fact btc-e.com has literally stolen my money.  Really funny situation ultimately, that an exchange can act like such asses.  I will definitely get over this, whether or not I recover the bitcoins.  
People insulting my mother for no reason just shows the intelligence of some reddit users.
