Blockchain is a decentralized consensus. If an institute eg a bank wants complete control over its network, why use blockchain at all? It can just upgrade its existing centralized network and easily beat Bitcoin's efficiency and scalability.
Bitcoin exists not for faster transactions/lower fees, these are just bonuses of getting rid of the middleman. Bitcoin's value is that no one completely controls it.

I agree. But there are cases you do not have control over e.g. someone's donation address. And if you create new address for each transaction you can also check if the address is clean (or some victims have already lost their coins there).

Thanks for your comment.
The biggest problem with nlocktime is miners may drop the transactions so the merchant will need to store and push them.
And if the payer spent the coins before the nlocktime Tx is mined but want to continue the subscription, he/she must create another Tx and notify the merchant  in case it was dropped by miners.
CLTV needs only 1 Tx with multiple small PS2H outputs. nlocktime would require multiple Tx to work and use more space.
