Hello ,

Nice , but I have 2 problems with the app : 
-I cannot set a fee higher than 0.0001 and we had to wait 30mn for the first conf in local trade. 
-I can't sell in two currencies, I have to choose one : 
I live in France , near Switzerland , and would like to sell in CHF / swiss and € / France.
Thanks !

That's what I'm talking about.. Circle do it , not with voicemail , but with sms pin .
And it's vulnerable too.. 
One example :
Last time I changed my phone , I had to change my sim card too. 
I went to SFR (french operator) and said : 
* Hello , I have a new phone and I need a new sim card. 
* What is your number , sir ?
* 06xxxxxxxxx
* What is your name ?
* xxx xxx
* Ok , your new sim card is active , you can send and receive call now..
* Thanks !
No ID card , nothing .. I leaved the shop with an active sim without showing any proof of ID ... 
I left this operator because of this , but I think many phones operator around the world don't follow the security rules when they have 20 clients waiting in the office..
And like Shubham Shah say in his article , it's not hard to get login+passw : 


The victim's username/email &amp; password.
The victim’s attached mobile number to the 2FA service.
A mobile number spoofing service
The mobile networks voicemail number for remote access.
Realistically, as a sophisticated attacker, the above four requirements are not difficult to obtain. Getting the account password can be done through any of the traditional methods, and obtaining the mobile number attached to it, is not so difficult either nowadays.
Another example : 
Like Shubham Shah , I assume it's not hard to break into any phone operator's website , only protected by login+passw.
Once it's done , you can change easily the address of the victim , get the operator to send yourself a new sim card with a new pin code 1234 to the new address , and 2 days later , you can access Circle account bypassing the 2fa security..
Sorry for my bad English ;)

Like forgetting/mistyping the login password of my Airbitz wallet?


Like writing down the login and password of my Airbitz wallet?


Like the paper with my Airbitz log+psw? You know I'm getting old, man.


Why would a layperson change his master seed?
Also, my trezor/myc don't need a new seed when I create a new HD wallet iirc.
And yes my 24 words are preserving my transaction history. The only thing missing are the labels.


Like when you tell him the only way to secure his Airbitz wallet "correctly" is to buy a second new and clean phone for 2fa purpose?
My trezor is smaller and more secure for big amount, and for pocket change, I don't need one.

It is not illegal for a payment service provider to ask for ID, even in Germany. 
The license Neteller has in UK applies for all EU. 
And PSP are required to perform KYC/AML, including storing the ID of their clients, because they hold your money on their account. Like a bank, except they can't lend you money.
But they are the kind of company with the right and duty to ask for this kind of documents.

I'm talking from a business perspective.
We, Europeans companies can accept US customers, and can sell on the Internet every product our government allowed us.
There is no law against selling bitcoin to an US resident or even citizen in our country, and I think in all Europe.
The customers come to us themselves, we are not on the US soil and respect fully the laws and compliance of our jurisdiction.
The only thing USA can do is pressure our banks, and they will at worst close our $ account.
But we will **still** accept US customers, on our € account if we have to.
And we will try to find another $ account as long as there is no law in our country that forbid it.

Us websites don't respect our French privacy laws (cookies, tracker, etc)
You can even order illegal items in your country from an US based website (steroids..)
US products shipped to France do not come with our legal warranty, even with our CE European norm.
There are many example where you can see that's not a "standard global practice"

Craig thought that the trustee would allow him to return those coins because they were not trust assets.
The trustee apparently disagreed, leaving Craig with one extremely embarrassing situation.

If you sell btc for PP and don't ask for at least an ID, you will be out of business in 2 trade.
PP is the better way for scammer to "buy" btc with stolen account, or even to buy btc with their own account, and ask PP for a refund because, you know, their account was "hacked" or they didn't receive the product.
You don't want to show an ID to the seller, buy with Western Union, Moneygram, cash deposit, or prepaid card/voucher.
