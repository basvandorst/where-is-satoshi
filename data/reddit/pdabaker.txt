It depends who is in it.  If half the people in it are still hoping it will go to the moon and don't care about hodling then they'll slowly drop out the longer it stagnates.

My point is that there if bitcoin is widely used as a currency in twenty years, it will mean that it has taken over.  If people are mostly using dollars in twenty years, it means that bitcoin has either fizzled out entirely or filled a role similar to gold.  If it takes over, most people will not sell bitcoin for dollars because people will just buy things in bitcoin.

The thing is for exponential growth that number of sign ups needs to keep increasing too.  Once it slows down enough people will see that growth has slowed, realize that bitcoin will not magically make them huge gains anymore, and consider moving to other investments, and at that point it will be too late.

Modern buffet is not really a good standard to compare to.  Even he personally claims he can't make big profits anymore just because the amount of money here handles is so large.  Is he had gone all in on bitcoin, for example, it would be pretty much impossible for him to get out without crashing the market.  He also can't make money just by finding high value companies anymore partially because people are better at finding them these days, but mostly just because anything that doesn't have a huge market cap already can't handle the amount of money he would want to put in.

The problem here is both of these posts are "wrong":
and both "sides" are arguing against the wrong statement of the other

If selling bitcoin is even an option in twenty years it means it has failed to become a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:06:43
I guess it's also possible that it gets used as currency in developing countries until they are stable enough to properly manage their own currency.  But anyway the exponential growth can't continue for 20 years - it will top out somewhere and stabilize or crash.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:21:47
If bitcoin is competing with all the other currencies it has failed.  In twenty years bitcoin will either completely take over (unlikely), serve as a digital gold, or crash to almost nothing.

It's harder to force the price up/down using money, but if you have knowledge of something that would significantly impact the price (for example, some change in regulation by a large national government), it would still be easy to profit off of that.  Insider trading doesn't require that you control the price, just that you predict it using insider knowledge.

Because we make them for a specialized purpose?  It doesn't take a single computer doing everything you can to make you jobless, it just takes a specialized computer for any specific task that would be worth paying you for.

Also pretty strange to see people who can imagine a future utopia and wish for a libertarian shithole instead of a post-scarcity society.  Like, good luck getting your bitcoin when computers can do anything you can do better.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:05:14
Also what seems reasonable to me. It's kinda the same people who are into both of them.
The question is, when it becomes clear that bitcoin won't go up significantly any more, what will happen?  If people still like it after the fad chasers get out, it will replace gold.  But who knows what will happen when it stops going up.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:02:31
That's an interesting idea.  They could also still tax income from big companies or consumer tax either.  Although that would kind of ruin the dreams of the hardcore libertarians.  The biggest problem I have with bitcoin as a currency though is just that, while deflation is great for adoption, it's pretty terrible for the economy. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:45:09
Yeah, that's the point.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:16:19
I can't even comprehend the wishful thinking and lack of analytic thought required to think that is how things would go down.

Oh really?  How many times have you become a millionaire?

Why doubling and 4x?  If you don't have a reason for your price target all you are doing is gambling.

I mean, you won't know at the time, but when you look back and realize you've been holding BTC for 10 years and it hasn't changed in value and the dow has gone up 50% you'll know.

This sub is so full of bubble type thinking it's scary.  Maybe people who buy in now will make money.  Maybe it will settle at twice the price of today and they will make a lot of money.  But just remember that there will be a time where a lot of people regret buying in the day/week/month/year before.
Edit: corrected word

Rich people are committed to be rich (buy dotcom companies)
Poor people just want to be rich (ignore dotcom companies)
Wow yeah great logic here.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:06:33


I don't know why you would think this, or why you would think bitcoin becoming the world currency would cause it to happen.

With voting stocks isn't the idea kind of that if it got cheap enough you could just buy enough of the company to take control (at which point the stock is clearly worth a lot to you).  Though there are definitely non-dividend non-voting stocks that literally do nothing (GOOG)

You're right, the people that got out in time did fine.  But nobody can call the top until it's past.  If you buy and hold relying on parabolic growth you will eventually get hit with the drop.

You could get rich a lot faster by putting all your money on red repeatedly until you hit a million dollars.
I mean, yeah sure you'll most likely lose everything, but just think of the possibilities if it worked!
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:12:30


You don't know how much reward there is or how much risk there is in BTC.  But literal gambling is an extreme example.  You could put all your money on TSLA, or you could spend all your money on puts for EA or you could put all your money in gold.
But all of these things would be pretty stupid too.  The less you diversify, the more it becomes high class gambling.  Don't put all your money in BTC if you wouldn't be willing to put it on red.  And sure you could just put 1-2 thousand in, but then you're not gonna become a millionaire are you.

What future do you see exactly?  Bitcoin becomes the world currency and all the governments will just lay back and accept that they can't tax anyone and we will live in an anarchist distopia?

It existed, but it was still in beta.
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:32:06
Just going to point out that in an optimally moving market (not claiming it is one) this would work the same way dividends do.  That is, the price would slowly raise as it gets closer and then drop afterwards by exactly the value generated, and therefore you wouldn't actually have a better chance of beating the average.
