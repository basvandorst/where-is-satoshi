It could, yes, but it's uncertain. The way I see it, r/bitcoin doesn't trust that technology will improve fast enough to keep up decentralized Bitcoin adoption using onchain scaling (aka increasing the blocksize when the mempool fills up) while r/btc doesn't trust Core to let Bitcoin change the world in the way they want (easy access to (noninflationary) peer-to-peer trustless electronic cash).
r/btc sees it as fine if banks around the world are the only ones to be able to afford mining and businesses to be the ones running full nodes, since the way they see it there would be enough countries/banks they won't be able to collude. r/bitcoin (and Core) disagree with this, though I don't remember why.
r/btc also considers the high fees that Bitcoin runs into whenever the mempool fills up to be a direct hindrance to Bitcoin usage and adoption, and don't consider LN/Core's plans to be sufficiently trustworthy (due to potential centralization of LN as well as Core's plan of making (on-chain) Bitcoin a settlement network rather than p2p digital cash).

I don't know if this is really on-topic for the sub. He thinks bitcoin has failed, so he must be wrong about everything?
Writing secure code is anywhere from (just) extremely hard to impossible by all accounts, and that's without the platform being the web, which is... inconsistently put together at best.
I'm not sure the replacement would be any better after 30 years of development, but a fresh start provides an oppurtunity to do better. (Though we probably won't, even after past lessons.)

He's saying that they're buying with their disposable cash, but if the banks freeze their accounts they can't use the rest of their money to pay bills.
Pretty much the only way they're better than an exchange is anonymity/privacy and preventing account freeze (if any banks are still doing that at all)

Interest is payment for their loss of liquidity and the risk they take on that you won't be able to pay them back. If it's all in btc on the blockchain, the creditor is by necessity a full reserve lender, which is higher risk. These things imply high positive interest rates.
Negative interest implies the "debtor" is doing them a service, and in that case there's every incentive to borrow and none to lend, ever, unless there are extra incentives. "Negative interest" is more accurately applicable to how we pay the current banks to hold our money to secure it, insure it, and to provide other services like debit cards. Banks are less unwieldy and more safe than carrying large amounts of cash. Those are the extra inventives that lead people to "lend" banks their cash. (Lend in quotes there bc they don't usually ever ask for it back... until the bank rush :p)

I suspect they are following their principles. When following principles, you don't help Satan/the other side just because he's going to win.

Do you have roommates, btw?

There are potential systems! I'm not aware of many with liquidity yet, but here's a good summary of the current existing ones.

If you're planning to trade and you're not in the US, then you can margin trade and short as well.
I'm assuming greetingearthlings said "wait" bc they expect crypto markets to correct/drop over the next six months.
I do too, but I'm a US citizen :(

Actually, this makes it "untracable" (or closer to it, depending on the ATM) but not necessarily "clean", which means to have a plausible legal source for the funds being laundered.
So these are good for privacy but not automatically useful for money launderers except in the untracability.

It's definitively *not* good "business practice", but they see it as worth the monetary cost, at least in the beginning and possibly forever. Many people in bitcoin value much more than just gainz; they see the changes being made as antithetical to their hopes for the future of P2P digital cash, and so support of it is support for something either suboptimal or directly opposed to what they hope that future will be.
They value that vision of the future more than the money they are likely to lose by following it, basically. You can deny that the changes made break that vision, but denying their values/preferences just because yours differ (if they do) will never, ever change their minds.

Hey, he said he'd put his dick where his mouth is - that's even better than money!
