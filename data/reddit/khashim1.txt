What exactly does it mean to have your Btc wallet stolen?
@_date: 2019-11-05 00:32:08
Can't transfer the BTC you have on Robinhood. You don't actually own the BTC you get from there.  
For the BTC you actually own, I use Ledger hardware wallet. Costs about $50 and is pretty simple to use. Others might suggest software wallets, paper wallets.

I think you have an arithmetic issue.

Thanks. What wallet do you recommend?

What if you move to England and exchange  1 million dollars for 1million pounds. During your stay in England the US dollar collapses and the dollar is worth 1/100 of what it was when you moved. You find someone who is willing to sell you his house in the US which was once worth 1 million dollars for 10,000 pounds. You agree and make the exchange. Do you owe capital gains in this scenario too. You're just buying someone's house for what they are willing to sell it for. Why do you have to pay capital gains tax on it?

Even easier with Ethereum. Buy $1000 worth of ETH when they were worth for $1in January 2016. Sell all 1000 ETH when they were selling for $1000+ in January 2018.
You'd be a millionaire with a $1000 investment and a 2 year wait.

I've talked to a few people 50+ about bitcoin. All were already retired or well on their way to retirement. None have a need for an investment that comes with risk. All they need is to stay on their current course and will live the rest of their days comfortably.
Think this, along with other reason, explains why they are against investing in BTC.

So I should be happy that I have no money?

How long until someone actually uses bitcoin to pay their tab?

What is the advantages of having two different wallets?
@_date: 2019-08-24 00:23:17
I see. So the key is the IRS knowing when you acquired and disposed of it. I can see why the government and the IRS is not happy with crypto currency. It's hard to trace when you purchased/received bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-23 22:10:18
If the IRS has no way to verify that you got the BTC originally for 600 then you wouldn't have to pay the gains tax?
@_date: 2019-08-09 00:20:48
It's a unit. Equal to 0.00000001 bitcoin

Thank you all for the replies.

Try coinbase.com for buying bitcoin.

Don't  think this belongs in r/Bitcoin.

There's no harm in having a second wallet. Allows you to divide up your funds. You know the whole, don't put all your eggs in one basket.

In all seriousness, it's not a bad time to invest a bit in alt coins.

I'll take the Btc
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:25:36
I may be misunderstanding it a bit but doesn't the thin part of the candle show just show the range of buys and sells in that time frame. Meaning someone bought bitcoin for much more than it was worth, probably due to a typo. For example, they wanted to buy at 10600 but accidentally typed 10900. Since there were already sells at that price thd purchase went through. If that is the case it had nothing to do with whales. More to do with fat fingers.

You might not see it directly but when you use your credit card to purchase things you are paying a fee. Merchants pay a ~3% fee on credit card transactions. They know this before setting the price of goods. They adjust their prices to compensate for this fee.
Whether you know it or not, when you make a purchase you are paying a fee.
@_date: 2019-09-05 21:17:28
I see. So when something like that happens it is not actually changing the price of Btc globally, all its doing is eating up all the sells within your particular exchange. 
It is a weird thing to happen but not nearly as huge of an event as you made it sound. Some one wanted ~$8 million worth of bitcoin and it made the numbers in your exchange go wonky for a little bit.

If you Google updating ledger Nano S firmware and then click the link on the ledger website it walks you through the steps you need to take.

The obvious adverse reaction is that Btc price shoots up as soon as you sell. You sell for a 15% when Btc Actual price increases by 100%.
Another (opposite) adverse reaction. You buy bitcoin. While looking for a buyer Btc price shoots down. Now it's worth 50% of price as when you purchased. Now selling even at 15% more than market price you lose money.

Unprecedented? BTC was less than half this price just less than 6 months ago.

Sounds pretty scammy. At the very least a bit pyramid schemey. If I were you I'd do what I can to take out as much as possible when you get the chance.

Counting on just your memory is a horrible idea. Have you considered getting a safe and putting a written copy of the seed in the safe.
@_date: 2019-09-13 19:10:44
Imagine being the guy who spent what is now worth 5.5 billions dollars worth of BTC on something that is probably worth a 1/10,000 of that.

I'd chip in a few Satoshis.
@_date: 2019-09-20 20:27:19
We already have a Satoshi as a name for 1/100,000,000 bitcoin. So we can use that naming convection for small amounts of bitcoin. If in the future we find we are always using Satoshis by the 100s, then we can create a new name Hatoshi, as a bad example, to represent 100 Satoshi. So your groceries could cost 1.3 Hatoshi, instead of 130 Satoshi.
