be careful when trying to catch a falling knife, you should probably wait to see upwards momentum before you call the bottom
@_date: 2017-01-11 19:37:51
MOMENTUM... not simply just price going up... You should probably stop looking at the 5 min charts and keep the the daily/weekly bruh

taking investing advice from reddit is generally a bad idea

It's not fiat money though, it's literally just numbers if you're talking about debt.
Also the futures/derivatives essentially started by Japanese rice traders in the 18th century.

That's debt though, which is fueled by more debt to pay that debt.

That's called speculation.
If the system were to collapse, the world would have a lot bigger issues than btc... 
@_date: 2016-12-23 01:27:42
pretty much, I remember when btc was 1000+ people were trying to buy as much as they could afford...

quantitative easing for almost a decade can be a cause for concern.
btc changes with the wind as well, as you may know the price has been pretty volatile in the short run.
people have less savings because of more debt and higher prices of goods and rent (ie inflation)

try coinbase.com or even localbitcoins.com

Guessing by the amount of downvotes, there are a lot of butt hurt people in here

I definitely agree with you, this is just a comedic representation of a lot of btc buyers who got in at the top and thought it would just instantly make them millionaires, who are also the ones selling at the bottom to "cut their losses". Of course this is not even close to an accurate representation of of what btc has gone through, or even other financial instruments, but the psychology of the mass always seem to prevail.

I would like to know as well, the prices do seem way too good to be true

WF has been up and running on the east coast all day with no interruptions. Not sure what this has to do with bitcoins, especially with the MtGox situation..

with coinbase you can buy coins instantly, but it does require a few days to get your purchase, but it's a trusted and a highly used site. With localbitcoins you have your choice of buying from individuals either locally and physically (in your hometown/close by), or you can choose to send money via bank deposit for people across the country. It is always nice to meet people in person!
