no but if you're fast and include a decent transaction fee you can tip the drone and hope the confirmations go in quick

Nothing is happening dude. 
There's not such thing as a bitcoin hater on reddit too, it's mostly people who enjoy laughing at bitcoiners and their desperate quest for the moon.
You guys still can't wrap your head around the fact that no one gives a shit about bitcoin save for some fringe cases.

if the spammer is a government entity from any country there's not pricing the spammer out of the market, because the spammer will outbid any fees legit users are willing to pay.
All the spammer has to do is pay for enough transactions to fill whatever tr/sec is the current limit and it's done
@_date: 2014-12-18 11:58:36
Only 25% of your transactions where fraudulent, that's good for bitcoin !

With bitcoin you have to walk the line between protecting your private key from thieves and not losing it yourself.

problems bitcoin could face: *some entity* decides to eat the transaction fees and starts to spam the network until legit transactions can no longer go through
this would cost less than 50k a day

You made a bitcoin purchase AND a meme, that's some 1% stuff
@_date: 2014-07-20 15:13:56
I mean bitcoin is a cool experiment and mostly works but I suspect most people don't need it because the one legit usecase of buying shit online on shady sites without revealing your id or banking info is really niche
@_date: 2015-05-13 12:12:14
karpeles must be so proud of you
