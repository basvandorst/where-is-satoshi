Millibit-to-dollar parity yay

The thing is, Segwit is an opt-in code. And for Unlimited to deny a feature that many others need in order to advance their own agenda is politics. If Core doesn't increase the blocksize for a long time when the users think it's due, that's when BU will naturally get the stage and BU should have some faith in that. Unfortunately, they seem to believe that strongarming the market is they will ever prove their idea to be correct.

millibit-to-euro parity party!
@_date: 2017-02-08 04:13:20
Yeah but what do you have against Bitpay? Because that much bitpay can do too. Is Bitpay a bad company?

I'm excited for what OpenBazaar is doing but for this little project I'm only interested in something that I can use along side with other payment options. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 22:29:52
Great point
@_date: 2017-02-15 18:28:14
Personally, I agree with this guy from this article below and what avatarofultima said.
"Spencer Bogart, vice-president of equity research at Needham &amp; Company, is the bitcoin ETF Eeyore of the episode. “I think we need to take into heavy consideration the general conservativeness of the SEC,”  he says. “If you think of this just from a game theory aspect, if I work at the SEC and I approve this ETF and a lot of money flows into it and something goes wrong, there’s a very good chance I could lose my job over that. If I do approve and it goes extremely well, it’s very unlikely someone comes around to pat me on the back or give me a promotion.”
In a report released in early January, Bogart put the likelihood of SEC approval at 25% or less. In the episode, he also notes, “The very first task mentioned in the SEC’s mission statement is to protect investors, and the very last thing they mention is to facilitate capital formation.”"

I can do full stack, but more competent in frontend
@_date: 2017-02-15 13:02:51
I know it is.. But we've gotta keep our own informed. Plus, I think it's a positive thing people have their own ideas and want to sort things out through a discussion. That's what these forums are for. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 11:14:35
Why is everyone so angry. Seems like he just really wants to know.
@_date: 2017-02-03 02:29:50
Don't worry the market's responding to mBTC already. Check-out  it's a Canadian exchange with over 1000 locations. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 03:26:12
It sure seems though. Not trying to hype anyone haha not in @_date: 2017-02-07 19:28:47
Go to CopeWithTrump.org and use "for $10 off and pay using bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-15 12:55:51
Yeah there's no rush. Just stay close to source of information and be ready to buy in case it does happen.
@_date: 2017-02-08 13:20:25
Hmm I guess you're right.. Must have been influenced by the branding.. I'll do a little more research and let you know if they have any additional features like accounting or inventory integration that they do that's useful.
@_date: 2017-02-15 12:53:34
What's your reason behind it?
@_date: 2017-02-15 15:50:11
Hah this is great. Trust me I'm with you. But consider this too -&gt;
We've all been there and it's just a part of the process.
@_date: 2017-02-18 07:53:37
by withdrawing btc do you mean just btc or also converting it to cash and withdrawing it as well?
@_date: 2017-02-28 23:26:58
@_date: 2017-02-15 23:21:28
I hope you're right
@_date: 2017-02-15 11:28:41
I think Gemini's fee is like 0.25%

Ver is that you? We're listening to you. Please don't sue reddit. If you made a post on this sub about BU 30% I would have totally read it. I would have been out of fear not out of excitement but I would have read it. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 11:10:14
ETF approval is very unlikely. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:15:18
I see thanks for the feedback. I did do it intentionally but I changed it to something that makes more sense. And sure, I'll loop around if there's anything interesting that I learned.
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:18:53
Sry. Pretty old person here, I guess. What's the median age group here anyways?
@_date: 2017-02-15 11:13:30
Come on not cool this kind of response
@_date: 2017-02-21 05:15:08
interested. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:10:57
Bitcoins of course.

MBTC-USD parity party!

*First of all, I'm sorry for all the PBOC you've had to face. Your morale must have taken more than a few hits recently. Thank you for putting up a nice fight amidst all that.*
I have 3 questions for you:
**(1)** In light of the recent events, do you sense a softening of pro-BU opinions?
**(2)** Do you mostly feel, unfairly or reasonably regulated by PBOC in hindsight? 
**(3)** How many bitcoins would you estimate are currently withheld from withdrawal by PBOC?
Thanks in advance
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:32:31
It's because that word captures a specific sentiment many people can relate to. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 07:00:59
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:20:08
You're right, but I don't really wanna write up the code? What would you use?

can you find me a reference link to this? I'm collecting all the ridiculous things he said to post on rogerkver.com

Yay to millibit-to-GBP parity!

Millibit-to-GBP parity party
@_date: 2017-03-09 07:02:08
look it up. original post where it's from is pretty funny
@_date: 2017-01-08 06:53:08
Flibbrmarketplace clearly has some agenda for bits.. Any ideas on what it might be? I see multiple of these posts pushing for bits as units when clearly people think it's confusing and a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-01-08 14:27:09
So much simpler.  This needs to be in circulation. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 01:46:26
If you've been out of the loop you probably need to go through the whole KYC/AML procedure. So for now, I think your best bet is localbitcoins.com.

It's the Millibit era!
@_date: 2017-01-08 07:40:42
@_date: 2017-01-10 20:45:29
I agree with you. mBTC parity with USD is a huge deal and could be marketed better.
@_date: 2017-01-09 13:33:18
@_date: 2017-01-08 06:44:55
In my opinion, it's counterproductive for us and negative for publicity of bitcoin to keep revisiting this discussion over the units for bitcoin over and over when we've already agreed on them. Btc mbtc(millibits) and satoshis. Please refer to bitcoin wiki. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 00:13:45
I'm making Shopify for merchants who want to accept bitcoins right now. It's pretty close to being done. Let me know if you have any suggestions to make it more useful or more popular.
@_date: 2017-01-09 18:08:04
Blockchain wallet
@_date: 2017-01-08 23:20:20
I have a 256-bit encrypted wallet with bits. How many bits does my wallet have?
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:13:22
Great news for you!
Seems like mBTC is happening finally.
@_date: 2017-01-10 00:50:26
Doesn't really seem to be a division. Google bits then  google mbtc or millibits. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 02:17:15
I agree but we have mbtc for that

I have a question. I heard some POW-based altcoins with lower hashrates got double spent recently. Could this be a threat in the earlier phases of BIP148? Just a concerned hodler. Would really appreciate a pointer to a legit source. Thank you
