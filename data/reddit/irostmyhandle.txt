Memes have been scientifically shown to be the most effective method of communicating absurdity. Who cares what regulators think? No regulator can succeed at stripping away people's rights, if they do not consent.

The "Bitcoin network fee" was significant because the total transaction size was always 0.01 BTC or roughly $3.40. I assumed that at higher transaction amounts this would become statistically insignificant, but it is still dishonest. I already paid fees to the network, and they sure didn't.
The hidden spread is definitely the biggest difference between Bitreserve's real and advertised costs.

If Bitcoin is declared a currency in one country it will have a ripple effect throughout the world. There are many legal triggers for this in various local laws, hence the negative externalities.

1000 bits Such a bright future for bitcoin around the world. Thanks for posting this insightful interview.

When you can't play a bitcoin game any more, because it is now considered a bank, you'll understand. When you have to apply for a bank license to make an app, it'll really hit home.

Why is this viewed as a good thing by so many people? If bitcoin gets defined legally as "currency" there will be all sorts of negative consequences to counteract the good. Examples:
- Existing bitcoin services all around the world which had previously been legal become illegal/regulated overnight
- Blockchain 2.0 projects like colored coins become automatically branded as currency as well. They may have nothing to do with money, in reality.
- Other contract-type uses for the Bitcoin network are harmed
- bitcoin accounts in various jurisdictions become treated like bank accounts, once again abandoning the unbanked populations

Considering both businesses advertise a percent based fee structure, it shouldn't matter. The only flat fee shown was the Bitcoin network fee that bitreserve charged. That flat fee was why I split theirs into flat fee included and excluded.

I only tried a couple of transactions. Is this 1.5% and up spread normal for bitreserve? Does it vary, or is it always the same?

Who cares about the unit of account, or if bitcoin is money? Bitcoin is a payment network first and foremost.

This doesn't even mention PayPal... Your comment is intellectually dishonest.

Yes but if the people do not consent, even an unelected, flat-earth regulator can't put a policy in place. I think the super OP was aimed at the general public, who might sign a petition.

As the amount transacted was 0.01 BTC, you need to multiply the fees by 100 to get their 1 BTC price quote. In the case of the "Bitcoin network fee" this doesn't scale evenly, so I quoted different numbers. The commission is % based, and so should scale uniformly.

Thanks for your service, and response. I have some comments, though, as I tried to be very thorough, and you were less so.
- Your deposit and withdrawal are 9 minutes apart, while I did mine at the same time, to ensure I was looking at the spread, not the price movement.
- You counted the Bitcoin Network fee once, as if it hadn't been charged to you by bitreserve. I paid it to the network, and then was charged by your service again.
By your own reporting:
Deposit of 0.01 BTC for 3.36 USD (336 USD/BTC) @ 10/29/2014 3:27 pm
Withdrawal of 3.36 USD for 0.00969007 BTC (346.7467 USD/BTC) @ 10/29/2014 3:27 pm
In short, how can I get in on your sweet employee discount?

Many legal systems define 'currency' as being legal tender of some sovereign nation. They then write laws using the word with that definition.
Bitcoin does not currently fit that definition, as no country considers it legal tender. As soon as one country calls bitcoin legal tender, others will be forced to treat it like 'currency', whatever that means under their law.

bitUSD is decentralized but not a proper USD hedge. Backing USD with an illiquid altcoin is not very robust. Basically, the entire bitshares network and market is counterparty to your 'USD' value.

300% of what, though? The market for this altcoin is tiny. If an exchange gets hacked, or one of the few key players in bitshares disappears, all of it goes to zero. Including your 'USD'.

Coinapult's Locks service provides a similar service including gold and silver. Also, it is live, unlike bitreserve.

All sorts of things have value that aren't equities, securities or money.
You buy and use pencils, paper, and wood. They have market value, and each has been used in barter, in a pinch. Coinapult and other people like me will buy factoids for the express purpose of publishing things on the blockchain. This has a value, is limited in availability and hence we are willing to pay some price.
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:11:57
This is magical thinking. The units on the blockchain ledger must have some value to be useful. Centralized services like Bitreserve are only useful when complimented by bitcoin. Without bitcoin, Bitreserve is just paypal with trendy branding.

"additional charge" is the key. Additional. They charge a significant spread, which is not talked about anywhere.
