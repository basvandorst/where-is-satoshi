When you spend from a paper wallet the private key is exposed on the device doing the spending. The key is not as safe anymore anyways. Best to the spend back change to a fresh paper wallet. Or just get a hardware wallet as most people can't do paper wallets properly anyways.

Thank god it's not bitcoin cash green.

Super easy to own whole bits until Bitcoin is well over a million. Easier to deal in whole numbers than decimals anyways.

Use 24 word seed. Give them half or 12 words. The other 12 words in will. This way lawyers can't steal it and family can create seed after will is revealed. Trying to encrypt seed exposes it to a computer if you are using a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:24:54
HD wallets are still your keys. More people would likely lose btc if change went back to used private keys. Seed lists are the new way of storing keys.

At least with multi sig the trust is distributed a bit between a few parties and not a single source

Good for censorship resistance. Gotta block more than internet.

All forms of money used to require trusting in people in order to estimate it's supply. With bitcoin it can be measured precisely by everyone independently.

If you used satellite for bitcoin blockchain data would it be possible to run lightning node over a normal phone line or would some type of light lightning node be needed?
@_date: 2019-02-08 13:28:30
A neat thing about a blockstream satellite node is you could also broadcast signed messages to all the nodes so they can verify blockstream data and that they are on the correct blockchain without needing internet. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 13:53:34
I was just thinking of using blockstream's upload feature to sign messages that can't be tampered with so the user can verify everything and never need an internet connection. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:41:09
That's bitcoin's competition? lol
@_date: 2019-02-16 19:01:48
If everyone used Wasabi wallet for their spending hot wallet at home, bitcoin would be anonymous today. And, it sets the stage for Schnorr combined transactions for lots of bitcoin scaling.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:13:58
Why is it taking BTCC so long to drop Segwit2x?
@_date: 2019-02-10 22:51:25
Does utreexo help with scaling and allow full nodes to skip distant past transactions?
@_date: 2019-02-08 14:16:46
My internet connected node would send data to blockstream for transmission and my satellite only nodes would see the message and it can't be tampered with and they would know blockstream is sending the correct bitcoin data. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 23:06:24
They collect a bunch of hashes and do the transaction themselves. Their website has more info.

opentimestamps is pretty good and run by Peter Todd
@_date: 2019-02-22 20:04:50
True, but I was wondering by using phones you don't have to worry about tampering in the supply chain. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 18:23:02
Easily hide your trail by withdrawing from CB to Wasabi and mixing. Then send the mixed parts to cold storage.  
@_date: 2019-04-22 11:04:03
Doubt it. It seems to incentive cheap renewable energy.

It was their moves with Segwit2x that I realized they are not leaders.
@_date: 2019-04-24 11:12:34
It's an excellent alternate to using Electrum and way more private as a regular wallet.
@_date: 2018-11-10 07:07:23
But no nodes would see this as a valid chain so it wouldn't work. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 21:58:32
Are any fiatcoins planning on using this instead of ethereum? 
@_date: 2019-01-02 23:17:12

That was a really good intro to Taproot. I can't wait to see the pull request when it's ready for testing.  
@_date: 2018-11-02 03:00:47
What about allowing a HW for main usage but when coinjoin is needed you authorize on the HW to transfer to a temporary wallet for the coinjoin and returned back to HW addresses. This way you only have to but a small percent of funds at risk for mixing and Wasabi can be used mainly with HW.

Can lightning in theory utilize Shnorr in future so a bunch of lightning closures can go through with single bitcoin transaction?
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:17:51
That's some old school FUD. I remember news talking about this years ago.
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:06:54
Perhaps there could be demand for fake Trezor's to learn PIN codes. As the target inputs the PIN on the fake device the attacker can now go on the stolen Trezor.
