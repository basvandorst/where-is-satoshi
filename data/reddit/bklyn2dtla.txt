I feel living in another country might be the only option when it comes to actually being able to retire and live comfortably. Then the question to that is how will I be treated medically in a foreign country, make sense ? 
I’m switching careers into the IT would, about to start working on getting certified. I’m interested in security, so not sure if that or what would be possible to work remotely in another country. And yes I agree with you about Thai women. 
Off topic any advice or suggestion living in another country and working remotely please DM or add to the thread. I mentioned before earlier I live a very minimal lifestyle. I could walk outside with a passport, cash, and my bank card  and disappear. I have little to no attachments and the attachments I do have I can break and be ok with that.
@_date: 2019-05-06 13:09:52
How does one do that ? I mean there’s so much material out there it’s very easy for a beginner like me to get lost and buried in all of it.
@_date: 2019-05-05 15:50:47
I don’t have debt, monthly payments, cc, or anything really. My life is very minimal. I could literally walk away from anything right now with the cloths in my back and be ok with that. As long as my passport, ID, and debit card was in my pocket. Not bragging I’ve just lived so long without getting attached to things it’s just become my way of life.

Think it will grow into being the 1st international currency? Oppose to having to trade dollars to euros to rubles to pesos to yen, we just have bitcoin for that.
@_date: 2019-05-07 12:11:00
Would coinbase be the better option for someone who’s just getting started in all this or order a hardware wallet and simply start and learn from that ?
@_date: 2019-05-06 13:16:58
Check cashing place, I’d say 50.00, but honestly I haven’t looked at the rates lately. 
I also haven’t looked into the fee for the BTM’s where ai currently am. 
Yes, and it’s quite simple, you can do it at the same place you cash your check and previously there’s wasn’t a fee for paying your electric bill and mobile phone you can walk in and pay directly as well. 
It would be amazing if I could get paid in Bitwage, but where I am now, I’m not sure if these folks have even heard of bitcoin and if they have most know less than I do.
@_date: 2019-05-05 18:51:08
So, bitcoin is just like investing in the market, basically.
@_date: 2019-05-06 13:29:45
We all have to start somewhere. I’m just a late bloomer. I don’t see anything negative about absorbing more and more information from this. I’m like a child with all of this at the moment so for me the more information the better.
@_date: 2019-05-07 11:49:02
This might be a very stupid question. But is the blockchain what makes bitcoin so successful? I ask or tell friends about what I’m slowly learning about btc and they all say something to the effect of, “ I don’t about btc but I believe in the blockchain. “  Now, maybe it’s two people who know nothing about btc and simply having a conversation with no meaning at all or not. Make sense ? Sorry, it 5am so my thoughts are completely awake as of now.
@_date: 2019-05-06 01:24:09
If you’re buying and using it immediately the odds are in your favor of a bit of a little increase.
@_date: 2019-05-05 15:26:32
We all have to have dreams and goals in life. Everyone had to start somewhere. I see the goal I like to go for and work backwards from that. So, if I can’t get 100%, then  maybe I can atleast get 65% of the goal I’m attempting to obtain.
@_date: 2019-05-05 23:56:23
So, it the second part of your post that keeps the playing field in a bit of a balance.
@_date: 2019-05-06 13:08:50
So, it’s randomly a group of people freaking out and drastic spikes happen ? Do you honestly believe in your heart it’s random ? Or these crazy gains and loses are a good way to keep bitcoin alive and keeps people flocking to it ?
@_date: 2019-05-06 13:31:22
I agree with you on that, 100%
@_date: 2019-05-06 01:20:10
Engineers for the facts and the students with their energy shows you this isn’t going anywhere, anytime soon.
@_date: 2019-05-31 11:51:51
Wow !!! I mean WOW !!! Thanks !!
@_date: 2019-05-06 17:28:03
What’s the average persons holding of bitcoin. ? A fraction of 1 ? 2 ? 5 ? 10 ?
@_date: 2019-05-29 22:52:51
Not the Ledger Nano ? Someone referred me to that ( Nano ) and the couple of YouTube videos I’ve watched seemed like it was top of its class. 
Pros and Cons to both ?
@_date: 2019-05-05 23:54:55
What if someone is living paycheck to paycheck like a large portion of Americans and can’t afford the market or to purchase land. 
But have the common itch like so many who play the power ball. Would you say sitting on cash or taking a risk and doing bitcoin ? 
I guess it’s like going,  I spend 100-150 a month on scratch offs and power ball and maybe you break off even or possibly win a extra 200 with that equation and that type of person, would bitcoin better a better choice ? Hypothetically speaking. 
I mean I guess there’s penny stocks ?
@_date: 2019-05-06 18:11:03
You just answered it and a way more technical and clear way.
@_date: 2019-05-29 12:40:51
Yeah, but I guess I could do something like 27.00 a week to make sure I clear 100.00 and some change a month.
@_date: 2019-05-06 00:41:24
What do you think keeps people wanting and buying bitcoin ? 
I  know that question can easily be turned around and asked back to me as to why I’m so interested in bitcoin. But seeing you have a stake in it and sounds like you’ve watched it grow to where it is today. What do you think attracts people to it ?
@_date: 2019-05-05 17:31:42
Have you or anyone used Bitcoin through cash app ??
@_date: 2019-05-29 16:21:26
Sometimes you is the simple things , thanks !!
@_date: 2019-05-07 23:56:29
How long do you think that’ll take ? Years ? Decades ? Or with this generation coming up ?
@_date: 2019-05-05 16:16:11
I don’t have any of those issues. I could invest all honestly,
@_date: 2019-05-06 00:55:18
Would your list or advise change depending on where a particular person lived ? Like if I were sitting in Twin Falls, ID or sitting in a brownstone in Brooklyn ? Would you add or take away anything depending on a persons location ?
@_date: 2019-05-05 15:56:23
I would start small and test the waters and over time if all is working out make a full switch.
@_date: 2019-05-06 01:20:59
I’ll read all that for sure, Thanks !!!
@_date: 2019-05-06 01:25:55
And it’s all savings ? Do you spend any of it or just save ?
@_date: 2019-05-05 18:49:39
So, with that being said, is it fair to assume its somewhat rigged ?
@_date: 2019-05-06 00:36:17
I making an assumption here but with your knowledge and the list of investments. You’ve seen the least gain in your bitcoin investment ? Or your list is simply listed in the least risk to the greatest risk, bitcoin being the highest risk.
@_date: 2019-05-29 16:39:34
Wait !! I’m going to have to pay taxes on this ? Please, if you have the time explain. 
I work pay taxes before get paid, then take my dollar and turn it into bitcoin and now I’m taxed again ??
@_date: 2019-05-05 17:26:19
So, the US are hoarders and the 3rd world countries are actually using them for actual purchases ? Or am I understanding this wrong ? 
What makes the market jump up up and fall so low in a matter of a day ??
@_date: 2019-05-05 23:02:22
Are we all just pawns in another chess game, working to get the biggest piece of the pie. So, big money has already rigged the system. It can be decentralized but that doesn’t matter as long as big money runs the show. 
Is there a power now big enough to completely crash bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-31 11:46:20
Good to know. Someone said to buy from amazon but make sure you’re not buying a used wallet, but I like what you’re saying buying straight from the supplier.
@_date: 2019-05-06 13:06:30
Simple argument to why you think it’s good ?
@_date: 2019-05-06 13:24:05
Have you done it ? What’s your pros and cons to it ? How has it changed your day to day life ?
@_date: 2019-05-06 15:23:35
Are there any attackers who whole heartedly want to destroy bitcoin ? I don’t see it myself with my very limited knowledge I only see companies slow adopting it.
@_date: 2019-05-05 17:22:23
Would you invest ? Have you invested ? What would recommend invested with a quarterly savings of 1,500-2k for example.
@_date: 2019-05-05 18:21:17
That comment and so many others in this post is why I am on Reddit. What you wrote I would have never thought of !! It’s mind opening and exciting for me to have another idea take root in my mind. 
That comment also reenforces and excites me about this new career path into the IT world !!!
@_date: 2019-05-06 00:45:14
Out of all those people, who would you listen to the most ? I ask that bc for some reason I think of the youth for some reason.
@_date: 2019-05-06 15:20:28
Is there trends ? Or is it 100% unpredictable?
@_date: 2019-05-07 22:21:28
How many companies are actually paying through Bitwage ?
@_date: 2019-05-06 14:06:59
Very true.
@_date: 2019-05-06 13:21:32
So, are you suggesting abandoning my idea completely?
@_date: 2019-05-05 15:32:52
What’s the fee, to go to one of the ATM’s and purchase bitcoin ? If I decided to do that, it would honestly be better bc I’d be so much more less likely to touch it, IF I only went with the saving account mind set.
@_date: 2019-05-06 23:48:23
Lol, I see.
@_date: 2019-05-06 00:30:34
Top 3 you project will be the big dogs in the crypto currency world ?
@_date: 2019-05-29 12:39:03
That’s what I’ve noticed by watching it for the past couple of weeks and thought, why not just buy the 25.00 a week and not worry about it. 
I’m also going into it with a “I’ll win in the end attitude” meaning I probably won’t gain much but not lose much either”. I will though be making the slow transition away from dollars and be 100% control of my funds and that is a great feeling to me.
@_date: 2019-05-05 18:13:58
So, what is truly the cause of the drastic spikes and falls ? Is there one person or country that holds a large percentage of bitcoin that can cause this. Is the everyday bitcoin investor just puppets on a string to a large force that control the price ??
@_date: 2019-05-06 18:11:57
So those folk went completely off the grid.
@_date: 2019-05-06 17:23:18
How can anything pass gold ? I guess what I trying to say is. Gold is tangible and bitcoin isn’t, so I feel that’s where the uncertainty of some people come into play. Granted most of those people are older and not to say older people don’t matter but the kids of today, gen z, and millennials are the future and they understand the digital world more than most. 
And I guess I sort of answered my own question as to how bitcoin can surpass gold.
@_date: 2019-05-06 23:45:04
I’m still searching for mine.
@_date: 2019-05-05 15:30:03
I’m thinking one day. ( says the person who doesn’t know much of anything ) but I have feeling or maybe I’m simply feeding into my own wants.
@_date: 2019-05-05 15:19:54
I agree with about not being in the right position, but thinking and getting opinions I can hopefully put together a plan and one day make this happen.
@_date: 2019-05-05 22:50:52
Does the regulations help or hurt it ?
@_date: 2019-05-05 22:57:40
So, this all for spending your bitcoin, not  making any, correct ? What are your thoughts on why all these HUGE companies now want your Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-06 18:22:04
So, you don’t see anyway receiving a loan will ever be done without centralized banking ?
@_date: 2019-05-06 01:18:30
I figure I’ll read The Bitcoin Standard and not continue to read no spoiler alert for me.
And with the 1st article I can see how, bitcoin beyond being a currency, can almost relate to anyone there’s so many reasons that it will connect with almost anyone who dares to read a bit about it.
@_date: 2019-05-05 22:59:08
The market before actual land . . . . .  And bitcoin dead last.
@_date: 2019-05-06 13:20:45
Where would you suggest I ask this question to get the other answer and their argument against it ? 
Do you think the negativity from people is bc they don’t have a understanding of bitcoin ? Or have you heard legitimate arguments as to why people are against bitcoin? 
I’m open hearing both sides as that to me would only strength my knowledge and understanding.
@_date: 2019-05-06 18:20:01
The greed part of humanity, I feel skipped me. I see how greed and material things can completely ruin people or they chase money and forget to live. I rather live and experience this life while I have it. Basics survival, individuality, and freedom is what’s really important to me. 
And women. 
I could easily buy bitcoin here and there throughout the month and months over years and forget about it and not check on it all the time. As of now I’m more interested in it as a way of life, not a get rich tool. Maybe I’m a moron in that aspect. 
My concern with that, is hearing all these stories of people losing their bitcoins. I don’t want to invest say 2-5k over a year and wake up and it all be stolen.
@_date: 2019-05-06 13:32:02
Thanks I’ll look into the other 2.
@_date: 2019-05-05 16:04:17
Oh ok, I was thinking, the BTM’s would be the easiest and maybe they are but you pay for the convenience. 
Why do you think they ask for ID’s and all that oppose to simply letting you purchase without ID ?
@_date: 2019-05-05 19:01:48
Hmm I never of the whole tax thing.
@_date: 2019-05-05 19:52:52
What about Monero ?? With your outlook, do you think it’s a higher probability to make it rich off crypto than playing the lottery ?
@_date: 2019-05-06 15:29:06
But where bitcoin is now, how much do you think is being taken away from them ? 
Also, what stops the big banks from stepping in and buying bitcoin ?
@_date: 2019-05-05 20:25:05
I’m not sure if that’s written in sarcasm or you’re being serious. If serious : when and how much did you invest in bitcoin ? How long did you wait t pull out ? What made you decide to pull out ? 
Side note : I’m about to start courses and getting certifications to get a IT career started. It sounds like you weren’t happy in the IT world. What would you say are the downsides to an IT career ?
@_date: 2019-05-05 15:15:42
My net worth isn’t that much, I’m the typical American living pay check to pay check with a minimal savings.
@_date: 2019-05-05 15:13:25
I’m sure people use btc for certain purchases, but are most people acquiring btc for long term investment and hoping to cash out big in the end ?
@_date: 2019-05-06 00:31:39
What would you suggest as the best sites to read and keep your finger on the pulse with all this ?
@_date: 2019-05-06 23:47:44
So, the cold storage is the best when you purchase and plan to simply sit on it.
@_date: 2019-05-07 13:08:11
Very true. When I was a growing up in the city during the 80’s I would put 50.00 in my shoe on the train ride home. I understand where you’re coming from.
@_date: 2019-05-05 23:04:17
Would you do 1/3 in bitcoins and 2/3 in centralized banking ? Or how would you break it up ?
@_date: 2019-05-08 01:40:29
I’m behind but I’m excited I have the time to catch up to speed and watch the revolution I feel like ( and this has always been my luck ) I’m coming in right before the tipping point.  And if I’m wrong this time, I won’t care this is all so very exciting to me.
