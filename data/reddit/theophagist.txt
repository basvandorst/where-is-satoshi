So there's no gender issue but you "assure me" that you must be "strong" to "walk into a space full of men" because of "how you're treated."  And how are you treated, sweetheart?  Like a the only woman in the room, aka a queen?  
I am nearly 40 years old and never in my life have I ever seen the only woman in the room get anything but the best treatment.  That's the way men behave, or at least, the men I keep the company of.   You really don't understand how good you have it so you invent a victim status to justify your unfounded insecurity. 
This is the kind of thing I'm talking about.  One minute genders don't matter, next minute you gotta be "strong" to have your ass kissed.   All the while, you're slinging suspicion around and demanding not to be catered to.  Sad, pathetic.

When someone is being a complete idiot I treat them like an idiot. I treat women like an equal, like I treat any man. They hate it because they are so used to being propped up and catered to.  
Take that one to SRS.

Please.  You separate yourselves by not choosing to participate then call us exclusionary when we don't pander.

I feel like that laissez-faire attitude contributes to many of the different ways consumers are fleeced.
