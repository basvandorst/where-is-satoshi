Politicians were bought long before Citizens United.

Make sure he has sole ownership of his private keys. His habits learned in this stage will inform company policy down the road.

Well we usually leave off the "dot com" too. So just google or facebook or reddit, etc. .gov, .org, and such get spoken, but .com is the default.
Whatever you do, just don't do "aitch tee tee pee, colon slash slash" at the beginning. ;)

"Cent" is a shortening/colloquialism indicating that it's 1/100 of something. Shorter, easier-to-say versions of most long names come into use naturally.
But really, do we need yet another unit that goes by the name "bit"?
@_date: 2014-05-11 08:58:48
This right here is why that's a really dumb unit.
The tip is 1000 microbitcoin.

Have you introduced her to Gyft? They have Target.

Hi! I'm a taxi driver and I take bitcoin. ;)
The rates just might be prohibitive if you're far from my stomping grounds.
@_date: 2014-03-25 10:01:34
Same. No whole foods in reasonable range, nearest target is in the next town over, but we have a walmart grocery. They may have just picked up the most reluctant excited customer ever.

There's a psychological  element to it, more so because the balance can't be held in your hands. A larger number "feels" like more and is easier to do arithmetic on than decimals. It's more satisfying for most people to own 10k of something than to own .01 of something else, even when the value in fiat is the same.
People who are used to thinking in terms of 8 decimals don't realize that the concept is very strange for newcomers. It's an education gap that btc needs to deal with to grow and that doge will need to in the future if it takes off. Talking in terms of mbtc is a good way to start to break that barrier as 1mbtc is valued on the same order of magnitude as many fiat currencies.

People with very little disposable income have a damn good reason not to buy lots of bitcoin, despite personal beliefs in the future of crypto and decentralized currency.

The question you are asking is "who is this person?"
The question you should be asking is "does this person have valid points?"

If you have BTC on a local client on your computer, clicking the QR code will send that transaction to your client with all the relevant inputs already done. Double-check and click OK.

I think you'll find that bitcoin 0.1.0 will not accept a block mined today. Bitcoin has hard forked in the past, and will do so  in the future.

How's that working out for them with drugs? How'd it work for alcohol during prohibition?

I'm pretty sure I could spend it on any goods that someone who wanted to use it to buy things from these black markets wanted to sell me. There are a near-infinite number of ethical purchases to be made from markets not regulated by the modern surveillance state and someone looking to make a purchase out of sight of Leviathan isn't going to be dissuaded from one illegal action by a smaller illegal action.
@_date: 2015-08-02 22:46:23
Plenty of black markets that wouldn't stop using it just because it's illegal.

The system isn't broken, the system is working as intended.

You do realize that there is a thriving black market in raw milk. Yes, because it's illegal. If it's not done online yet it's only a matter of time.

Non-fiat options? please, enlighten us.

So you're selling into...what, exactly? Selling your bitcoin (held together by voluntary associations) into USD (held together by violence, threats, and killing people overseas) seems like the wrong direction based on what you've said.

Then it rightfully belongs in unimatrix 0-1 where it is a tertiary adjunct.
