the Korean title articles says "make it illegal to  crypto trading" so i used the same term but you should read "allow crypto trading and stricter regulations for crypto exchanges" I think Korean journalists wanted to people to panic sell and buy themselves at low.

I'M KOREAN AND BITCOIN BAN IS BULLSHIT.
What they're doing is looking to regulate the exchanges to protect individual investors. (that does NOT mean they will ban trading online/offline) actually that's a good move. bitcoin/cryptocurrency ban is absolute NOT TRUE.

Upbit has released statement [
Their statement says Upbit did some cross trading during  the first months of their opening (during 9/24/2017 to 12/31/2017). they claimed that the did it with their corporate account "to supply liquidity to the market due to prevent unintended trade at extreme price (too low / too high) due to lack of volume.

They also claim that did not gain profit and they have sufficient assets in both crypto (103%) and cash (165%) for withdrawal by customers. They says their sorry for the prosecution, and the exchange is fully operational and will do their best for crypto ecosystem development
