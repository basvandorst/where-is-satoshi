So I went from an idiot to deluded eh?
I think you need to take a long hard look in the mirror bud. Just because YOU don't understand something or don't have experience in a particular field, doesn't mean others who do are idiots. I'm sure you realize that making this claim without any real evidence or merit..... to be honest, makes you look like a real idiot.
No one is claiming to buy and sell at the exact lows and highs, but you can determine, with a fundamental understanding of TA, when the market is getting close (along with sentiment and news). If signals tell you that something is overbought or oversold, then you get in or out according to the information.  What burns most people with trading is GREED. Waiting for that exact moment to leave or buy in and then FOMOing at the wrong times.

And this is suppose to tell me what now? Investing all depends on when you got in and when you got out.
If you manged to invest anytime towards the beginning of the year, then you're holding bags. Your capital is tied up and if you invested in altcoins, you're most likely not ever seeing that capital returned to you.
However, if you got in during Q4 of last year and decided to sell around Jan, then you're sitting pretty.
It's just that most (maybe not you) "hodlers" like to boast that they make wise investments holding when most of the time their doing nothing but simply holding bags for months or years at a time. It's the most elementary way of investing. Know when to invest and know when to get the hell out.
