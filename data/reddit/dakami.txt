Yes, I was thinking they're much more likely to already have scrypt cracking hardware sitting around.

I've been convinced by the botnet argument, but I think you can have your cake and eat it too here (i.e. you can create something that uses x86 but can't use the consumer base).

Though to be fair, there's a difference between a petahash and a petahash per second.  We're at about 2.5PH/s, or 2^41 work efforts per second right now.  To do 51%, you'd have to reliably do 2^42 work in a second.
Suppose the NSA was willing to spend an hour breaking 40 bit crypto in the 80's.  That's 3600 seconds, or ~11 bits more of work.  So with 80's tech the NSA would have deploy a 2^52 work effort.
Now, back then they were willing to let people use 56 bit crypto.  So, I think defeating Bitcoin's present work effort was well within their reach, *30 years ago*.
Now?  Now, they don't need to lift a finger.  Private industry has done just fine in making the average miner irrelevant (and thus, those miners have moved to Lite/Doge).

The whole point of the NSA pushing crypto down to 40 to 56 bits is that they've had the ability to do 2^40 to 2^56 bit work efforts for decades.
One petahash is a 2^40 work effort.  1500 petahashes is around 2^50.5.  They were doing that in the 80's.
(Yes, I'm skipping the constant work effort of a single round of double SHA-256, but that sort of falls out of the noise.)
I'd say the jury is out on my POW prediction (I didn't see the rise of Litecoin etc) but there's no question whatsoever on NSA capabilities.  They got fabs (a thing which, oddly, some people can't wrap their minds around).

2 years ago people thought Bitcoin would stay distributed.  It didn't.
@_date: 2014-01-29 05:06:44
I'm pretty convinced we can make a POW function for which an x86 CPU *is* the optimum ASIC (as in, if you can do better, you shouldn't mine Bitcoin, you should compete with Intel).
Problem is, people are right, this just hands Bitcoin to the botnet operators.
You need a POW function that has a combination of x86 and memory.  I've been working on this off and on, not there yet though.

Heya!  This is Dan Kaminsky.  Thanks for the post.  At minimum, you've *actually* read what I've had to write.  So I'm happy to reply.
Regarding the change in proof of work function:  I was right that people would move away from SHA-256.  What I missed entirely was the rise of competing cryptocurrencies.  The miners that would otherwise have pushed for Bitcoin to move instead put their efforts into Litecoin and Dogecoin(!), both of which use scrypt and both of which have actually gotten a market forming around them.
Bitcoin may yet move.  What I think you've not recognized is that the 99x hashing power availability is already the status quo.  Mining pools could throw away everyone not mining with custom ASICs and, frankly, not notice.  And the pool of parties with custom ASICs at scale is not large.  Certainly small enough to pressure.
The whole concept of Bitcoin is that the regulatory set -- the number of entities that need to be pressured -- would be too large to feasibly manipulate.  That's not happened.  Note by the way that transaction fees are fully undefined in the Bitcoin design.  Small regulatory sets can actually redefine transaction fees.  So there's motivation to create this state of affairs even without government interference.
Bitcoin was just not designed for concentration like this.  There weren't supposed to be concentrated mining pools in the first place, and the "control" on them (that misbehavior would lead to the pool losing its governance capability) was really never supposed to be illusory.
I'd like to point out this hasn't even required NSA mining hardware to accomplish.
As for the points regarding policy -- imagine we lived in a world where the policy was for police to randomly shoot people.  Should our response be, subsidized body armor?  Not saying it wouldn't help, but...

I think my primary claim around Bitcoin has been that the core software is surprisingly robust against attack.  I spent four months in 2011 bashing on the core software, fully expecting catastrophic failure.  None ever came, and I dutifully reported that.
This was, in fact, a prediction -- one that has proven itself in the intervening years.  There's been a few little things here and there, but nothing particularly serious after two and a half years.  Trust me, that does not happen with browsers :)
It's good code implementing a very novel design.  You really have to go to the real world deployments to find where things break down, and even then not at all catastrophically.  (Yet, anyway.)
@_date: 2014-01-29 05:04:00
The NSA laughs at Bitcoin's market cap :)
Double SHA-256 isn't really often used for hashed passwords, AFAIK.
Regarding ASIC spend, it's...quite high.
@_date: 2014-01-29 05:35:25
Gotta say, the tin foil hat community has done a better job of actually predicting the future than us scientists would like to admit :(
@_date: 2014-01-29 16:08:11
Oh, I'm well aware we haven't actually directly executed x86 for something like a decade.  It's more of an ABI than anything.  The thinking is that it's very cheap to design something that runs SHA-256 fast but actually ungodly expensive to quickly (relative to Intel) handle the various quirks of a general purpose instruction stream.
I mean, branch prediction and out of order execution don't happen for free.  Our ability to run SHA-256 faster doesn't follow the same curve as our ability to run x86 streams faster.  The latter is actually, genuinely slower and more predictable.
Those are potentially nice properties.
The game is complicated by, if you do it too well, the botnets take over.  So you have to make the work undoable by the millions of desktops out there *too*.
Kinda messy, really.  But the status quo is pretty much fully centralized so it'd be hard to get worse.
@_date: 2011-08-08 15:28:48
No.  You're talking about the ledger (blocks).  I'm talking about the loose transactions.
@_date: 2013-05-05 11:44:03
Everything is fiat because value comes from human opinion.  Bitcoin is interesting because the opinion is diffused across so many parties, such that nobody really can just declare new Bitcoin to exist.
In other words, it's all belief, but Bitcoin belief is consensus driven making it less fiat-y.
@_date: 2013-05-11 19:37:52
Actually, this is important.  What I mean to be saying is that there's just no supply available to adapt to the demand.  Supply is VERY static and predictable.  The demand pulses, supply cannot adapt, thus volatility.
That's definitely happening, but the terminology used is demand shock, not supply shock?  I could see that.
@_date: 2013-05-05 11:34:36
Maybe.  There are diseconomies of scale too.  But this asymmetry is just a major problem.
@_date: 2013-05-04 19:03:57
Zooko is saying some amount of the Bitcoin thefts have been spent, but my understanding is that the amount is miniscule to zero.  CAN is not HAS.
@_date: 2013-05-04 19:12:00
The fiat aspect of Bitcoin is absorbed in the community declaration that this Blockchain, and this protocol, is the one to trust.
There's always a nut somewhere, but Bitcoin distributes that nut (or at least tries to).

A car with a driver can run into a tree, a car without a driver can run into a tree...the reality is that we see regulation's failures in stark contrast while its successes are hidden.  This isn't a statement of support for regulation, which can take a large variety of shapes.
The price of diamonds was a lot more stable when De Beers controlled the supply.  Whether that's good or bad, it's just true.  The price of a good is much more stable on eBay when there's a manufacturer who can supply more of the resource at a New price.
You don't like how many things are regulated.  I understand that.  But currencies get a value boost just for having a lack of supply shocks.  That comes from being managed in response to demand, something Bitcoin just can't ever do.
Not actually defending regulation.  I mean, we're here discussing things on the Internet, the least regulatable thing evar.  The Internet would almost certainly not be better if you couldn't put up a website without a permit (and honestly it'd be replaced with a new Internet, in which you didn't need a permit).
What I'm saying is that things are...complicated.  Can we really run everything, like we run the Net?  Do we know what that will look like?
Wall Street hasn't been particularly regulated either.

Average PCs have GPUs.  They do not have SHA-256 accelerators.  The issue is that the centralized parties (governments) and decentralized parties (the masses) each have their advantages and disadvantages; being able to make an incredible server farm is nice but actually being a million people in a million homes is nice too.
Having the *algorithm* bias towards one of these cases -- the server farms have an easier time getting custom ASICs -- is a problem.
I'm doing a lot of work right now on what the work function should be. scrypt has parameters -- how much time, how much memory.  And, perhaps, there is a smooth work function for which a general purpose CPU *is* the optimum processor.

You misread.  It's not that regulated assets are or aren't volatile.  Any car can have an idiot driver.  It's that unregulated assets are, well, unregulated.  There's no response whatsoever to conditions.
If you don't add more staff to deal with the Christmas rush, checkout times go up.  If supply does not adapt to demand, access to the resource gets lets stable.  This isn't controversial.
@_date: 2013-05-11 19:38:06
And Wall Street is...kind of regulated.
@_date: 2013-05-04 19:13:23
The question is, how much better can you get?  How many orders of magnitude?
LOTS of work going on in this space.
@_date: 2013-05-04 19:09:38
Interesting response.
One thought is that Bitcoin just has a lot more competition in the store of value space, whereas there's just not that many unregulated (unregulatable?) value transfer mechanisms.  Even if Bitcoin wasn't anything special, there's just more storage providers than bandwidth providers, it seems.
I don't know about the value of these alternate currencies.  Maybe?
The botnet dependency is interesting.  My nascent thinking is that you can really do awful things with a botnet, but the worse you do the shorter you keep your botnet or your safety (since it's visible, outright theft).  I actually edited out discussion of botnet properties because I just don't know yet.
I'm not sure the Internet is straining under regulatory excess.  I know many systems that are actually nigh-regulated to death; the Internet is not one of them.
Agreed on Doctorow's warnings -- not sure they'll come to pass, but we need to be deeply aware of them.
