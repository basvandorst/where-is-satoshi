why the f do they call it "bitcoin core" wallet? NO ONE calls it that. no wonder he got confused. it also colours that wallet grey, and the BCH wallet orange, which is the colour of the BTC logo, whereas the BCH logo is actually green.
LOTS OF dark UI patterns in this app.

anyone know where i can see whose kyc was leaked? i want to see if I'm included in that...
@_date: 2018-06-15 18:52:45
I think it’s a joke isn’t it?
@_date: 2019-06-19 11:29:45
Wrong. It says it will fluctuate against fiat currencies in the white paper. And it’s not pegged to anything.
@_date: 2019-06-19 11:30:37
It’s not pegged to the dollar. It will fluctuate against government currencies. 
Did you read the white paper?
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:10:52
Inflationary doesn’t mean more of it is being created.
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:30:22
I never said that. Lol
@_date: 2019-06-19 14:46:04
What you heard is wrong. 
Read the white paper. 
It literally says it’s not pegged to any currency. Lol. 
I’m not a libra shill. I just think people in this space really need to read the white papers of projects before spreading false info about it, regardless if it’s positive or negative info.
@_date: 2019-06-19 11:35:32
Ok so you didn’t read the white paper. Got it. 
“It is important to highlight that this means one Libra will not always be able to convert into the same amount of a given local currency (i.e., Libra is not a “peg” to a single currency). Rather, as the value of the underlying assets moves, the value of one Libra in any local currency may fluctuate. “
Read the entire thing please ...

wow, my city has ruined my perspective of things...

Libra coin can fluctuate against fiat. It’s in the white paper. It’s not pegged to the dollar.
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:55:55
I’m aware what they call it, I read the white paper. They also call it a crypto currency. I don’t agree with that either.
@_date: 2019-06-19 16:08:18
You go buy your libra and be happy. 
I’ll stick with my bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-19 14:44:45
People need to read the white paper. Regardless if they support the project or not (I don’t), they need to be informed at least. Otherwise they just look silly.
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:08:00
this is great.
i think it should be listed in shitcoin/btc pairing though, not against USD.

It’s a centralized and permissioned database that’s spread across a few countries/companies. 
It’s not a blockchain because it can be changed by the centralized parties running the nodes. unless you think a mutable blockchain is a true blockchain. 
It’s not a cryptocurrency because it’s not permissionless. Unless you think a crypto currency with the ability to censor or block payments and confiscate funds is a true crypto currency.
I’m “one of those people” who prefers a censorship resistant, permissionless, trustless, sovereign, and decentralized store of value/method of exchange.
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:31:43
I’m not going to argue with people who can’t read.
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:29:50
bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:08:05
Lol. Right?

We've had three already this year. It's too much. 
@_date: 2019-06-19 14:43:47
Lmfao. 
I’m not a libra shill. 
But people do need to read the white paper because there’s so much misinformation and assumptions out there. They call it a stable coin, it’s not. It’s a coin that’s going to attempt to be stable. But it will fluctuate. 
The companies buying into the reserve are literally investing in Libra. And will want returns on that investment. They will get those returns or the project will die. 
I hope the project dies.
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:31:10
Oh. It’s 100% horrible. Don’t get me wrong.

Pretty sure he’s anti-lgbt too.
@_date: 2019-06-19 16:05:03
Girl, can you even read?
“It is important to highlight that this means one Libra will not always be able to convert into the same amount of a given local currency (i.e., Libra is not a “peg” to a single currency). Rather, as the value of the underlying assets moves, the value of one Libra in any local currency may fluctuate. “
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:07:49
That's kinda the problem though. Creating all this money out of thin air. 
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:33:35
I just said how it’s not a stable coin, it’s a coin that will attempt to be stabilized by the companies backing it.

i should note, i believe OP is talking about the segwit2x fork in November (which will create B2X or something). not about the fork thats about to happen in a couple hour (which will create BTG).
