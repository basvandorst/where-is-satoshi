I haven't been keeping track or anything, but here’s a few I think are rather spiffy, that I just happen have laying around for encouraging youngsters to question authority and to look after themselves. YMMV:

A lot of people fall for that.  
 I know me some. They tend to believe in magic and fall for scams. I don't wanna start a religious debate, but all three of the folks I know that have fallen for Nigerian scams are hard-core prosperity doctrine wackos with a very magical understanding of the internet. They felt that God making good on His promise.   
We managed to save one by closing out her bank account in the nick of time.  
People like that wanna believe, and get really pissy when you tell them they're being scammed.

right? I'm generally disappointed in them. every once in a great while a fantastic one comes around, but generally they're overly optimistic supported on an irrational framework of magical thinking.

My first tip! I don't know what the etiquette is in this situation, so I kindly say thanks and rise my glass to you.

I'm a newcomer too…and have found a lots of scams, but I find them reassuring—reminds me of the good ole days when the Internet was wild and free. I'm willing to put up with a load of independent scammers, hell I even respect them, really, they're more honest than the organized crime that has become the corporate/government mess. Corporations are scared shitless of risk anymore and run to daddy government to cover their ass before they'll even begin new ventures—the cost of business is chancing loosing your shirt, without that possibility we have a stagnate entitled class throwing their weight around because they can. Scammers are willing to go at it bare-knuckled and risk everything, I respect that.  
**TL;DR:** I'd rather live in the wild west that in so called civilization where winners are picked before hand and everyone is slowly picked clean by sanctioned ruffians.

I'm new to Bitcoins, please forgive me if this is naive. 
Would it be possible for a few power players to collude, artificially raise prices, and increase the acceptable transfer fees? Like the Wilklevoss brothers? Credit card interest rates and bank fees haven't always been outlandish. 
Is there something inherently different about the Bitcoin economy that makes collusion less likely? How about when the government decides to fuck it up?
I'm worried that governments and old-school investment houses—that don't, or refuse to, get it, jumping in and destroying it (much like the RIAA and MPAA continuly leaping before thinking...bad analogy?)

What is PayPal's reasoning? it makes it harder for the government to spy on people? Is that it? And credit card companies too have stopped dealing with VPNs.I'm getting antsy, it seems a  dystopian future is  barreling down on us.
