I think you might be from an alternate reality or just not paying much attention. 
Do you have any idea just how much financial law has changed just in the past 15 years? And the main reason for it isn't terrorism, it's control. 
I can pretty much guarantee they have well developed plans to deal with crypto currencies. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 18:20:50
It's in development. The code in the repository is quite impressive. They probably just cut the demo to work out some interface bugs or just don't have time to deal with supporting it.
I had the repo running locally in 5 minutes.

Not about trust between other participants, trust in the core of bitcoin itself. What if your private key wasn't really your private key? 
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:21:19
The uncertainty is the real problem. The cryptography doesn't even need to be compromised, just the illusion it had. A powerful enough actor could play off the public's inability to know for sure there wasn't a compromise.
@_date: 2014-05-17 15:03:53
It's plenty of time to code out the features outlined in his brief. 
The problem is a developer or small team is going to need to spend a whole month on an open source project that they *might* get paid for. 
Any application developer with the skill set to accomplish this level of work isn't going to be willing to risk a month of lost revenue.
If I was this guy I'd contact the core of BetterMeans and offer them the bounty. Maybe they just suffered some backing mishaps while required them to abandon their project for day jobs. 100k might be enough to sway them to come back for a month.
@_date: 2014-05-11 04:15:25
They have plenty of tools for covert operations already. They write their own playbooks.
I just can't see them continuing to support a technology that allows for anonymous transfers and threatens the US dollar for supremacy as the worlds reserve currency. 
Crypto currencies only work because of trust. Some 3 letter agencies are in the trust breaking business.
@_date: 2014-06-09 20:59:40
All they have to do is destroy the trust in it. How? Any number of the methods they've used in the past to do the things they want. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 06:26:44
Why thank you jolly good sirs!

Hey, I don't jackoff to the state. I'm actually kind of fearful of it. But I also pay attention and if Snowden has shown us anything it's that these people in power will go to some pretty drastic lengths to maintain it.
Losing control over the worlds reserve currency and all the financial tracking measures they've trashed the constitution over just isn't going to happen without a fight.
My prediction is a false flag operation where they 'break' the crypto somehow and completely destroy the confidence in virtual currencies. 
I've been a big fan of bitcoin since Satochi's first post about it hit slashdot some years ago, but I also know a bit about how the world works.
@_date: 2014-05-11 02:48:35
A few decades in federal prison is a powerful enough motivator for most people.

Why would you want to cut Paypal in at all if you have to have a BitPay account anyway?

Yea, I would say the opposite. The NSA is aggressively working to undermine bitcoin.

Old school spycraft... break into your place when you're not home and install shit, compromise equipment you order online, beat it out of you right before you commit suicide. That kind of stuff.
They don't have to steal all the coin to undermine it, just move  enough to cause panic. Our new president is good as spreading rumors and lies. It will be blamed on Russian and Chinese hackers.
They probably have Satoshi's keys already.

So if Apple were to comply with the government, might they demand something in return? Like maybe a 'victory' in a drawn out public fight?
I can't believe some many people are buying this bullshit.
The agencies will scorch the earth if their targets go dark. If the targets believe that tech is compromised they stop using it. It's pretty simple.
They're going to come for bitcoin too when it's time. They can 'break' confidence in the security any time they want.

Not necessarily. A title authority could issue a new one based on the laws that are currently in use. 
The blockchain would just hold a centralized permanent record. Courts could use that record in making judgements as to ownership.

Profits on currency trading in the US are taxed when they are earned, not when they are converted into US dollars. Read up on this at a Forex site.
A federal judge ruled that bitcoin was currency in August.
This could be interesting for some people.

Oh, I know. I remember reading about bitcoin when it first was announced from a slashdot article. I tried mining with the client for a little while but never got anything.
I was unemployed and in the process of moving so I just couldn't justify paying much attention to it.
I was even around during the big crash when people were begging for pizza's for coins. Still believed in it then. Why or why didn't I order some food for people :(
Almost bought in this summer at $60 but thought it might drop...
So in a nutshell, I should probably let people know when I do actually buy because it will probably be a good time to sell.
I do believe it's a good long term investment. Like buy know and wait 20 years kind of thing.

Taxes on profits from currency trading are due when earned, not when converted into US fiat, at least in the US.

I'm not so sure they can't. They can do anything with approval of the court.
When they seize cash they don't keep it stored in boxes in the evidence room until after the trial. They deposit it in the treasury and after the trial the court will hold a seizure hearing if necessary. 
I'm sure they're having meetings about this.
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:29:16
If you take claims on bitcoin forums at face value, we've probably lost about 100 million to date.

Why the need to convince them? I'd personally just stay quite about it. If someone asks, tell them how to go about it or why you're in a buy and hold mindset.

In your vast amounts of life experience so far, have you actually had any success asking complete strangers about their money and investments?
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:37:49
Yep. Pretty much this.
I'm calling they sell it off before the trial. A federal court already rule bitcoin was a currency, so they can just deposit it in the treasury like they do with any other cash seizure. 
Look at the amount of people sending that address coin though, I bet they're making a grand a day from people sending to post a comment.

The mailing list has had institutional investors solicit large quantity purchases in the past. You also have a rather public evangelical movement of coiners that have been out on the circuit for years. 
If you have the motivation and the money to make a serious purchase, these people are pretty easy to find.
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:26:23
I should of caught that. I asked though because I was wondering about the possibility of going after them for it now. IANAL, but since the card holder admitted that it was his kid, he's kind of responsible for returning the property. It wasn't worth the effort at $30, but now? 
Sucks though, I hate assholes like that.

I was at my bank a few weeks ago in the US, Chase. I gave them my ID and asked for a cash withdraw of $6000. They know me at this branch.
The teller asked me what it was for. I was shocked. I didn't say anything, just stared at her.
She starts mumbling about large sums of cash and scammers and looking out for their customers. 
I told her to make it $8000.
She said she had to go to the back because she didn't have that much in her drawer. She really went and told her manager something, then went and got MY cash.
One of these days they're going to say no. All they're waiting on is a legal mandate from the government to do so.

Government regulation at this point is going to be a costly proposition, at least for the government that attempts it. The cat's kind of out of the bag at this point and I think legislation could backfire in a big way.
What I'm concerned about is an effort by a bad actor to deliberately drive the price up by continuing to purchase small volumes, say a few thousand coins at a time, with the sole intent of eventually having a large enough quantity position to lead a massive devaluation and sell off for the sole purpose of discrediting bitcoin. 
This actor would lose a lot of money in the process, but considering the market cap is only 15 billion at the present, they are many institutions out there capable, and with the incentives to do this.
How many people would come back to a virtual currency if they bought in and lost 80% or more overnight? Think of the change in the tone if this happened.
Control of money is a very powerful tool. A very small number of people can claim that today and I'm so not sure they're willing to lose that and just chalk it up to change and technology. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 12:13:26

The market will respond to the sudden supply and know where it's coming from and why. 
I imagine there's 144mil in demand left in this market, which if they try and dump, will be temporarily worth a lot less and some people wanting to buy will get a pretty good deal.
The market will recover.
I'd be more concerned about the feds buying up additional coin that can't be tied to them, way more than 144k, dumping that, then eventually dumping their silk road holdings while claiming to be a victim of the market.

A sustained, deliberate effort to start and maintain a collapse for the sole purpose of discrediting the whole concept could be an attack vector.

He's right about this.
Bitcoin is an illusion for people who can't understand advanced mathematics and the economic values thereof.

They would never name a bill something like that. It would be called something like the "Sunshine and Puppies Act".

I have a reason to have incentive. If there's coins at this address and then they vanish, I've got a weird local issue.

Still gave it to me without an explanation of what I was going to do with it. If I would have answered her she would of stopped talking, which was more telling than her initial question.

Sorry, but you would probably just overheat your laptop and gain nothing.
Mining is done on dedicated hardware costing thousands of dollars, and still isn't that profitable.
Better off just buying coins outright.

Lost me right there. You acknowledge Gov deceit with DES but insist on being condescending.

A big player holds a massive btc stake and potentially stands to lose the most from bitcoin adoption. I wouldn't forget about this.

Some people just can't grasp the concept that people have already bought the idea of money represented by bits in a computer somewhere. This occurred long before bitcoin came into being.
All bitcoin has done is move the ledger out of the hands of a few and put it into the hands of every participant of the currency. The benefits to this are too many to post here.

Yea, they used to sell a lot of fake Id's and counterfit currency on silk road.
Alot of people were scammed out of coin on localbitcoins this way. They buyer would meet with the seller in public and pay with fake money.
Sucks man. Hope you can find this guy. Got any pictures of him? Like real ones from a video chat?

Sorry, just caught up in all the hype. What is a Pog and why do I need them so bad now?
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:00:46
The same reason why babies and puppies grow so fast.

When you believe you're some kind of messiah for having one of 2 possible predictions for something, people may not find much value in it.
OMG! Bitcoin could crash? That never occurred to me. Has anyone else heard anything about this being possible?
