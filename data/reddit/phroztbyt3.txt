well the thing is, there was already that massive surge in BCash.  Now the investors are starting to understand it was a ploy/scam.  So it's slowly deflating.  That's my take on it anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:41:56
To put it in perspective, the realestate market is worth literally 5000 times more than bitcoin in totality.  Many other industries are worth so many times greater as well.
There is much room for growth. In fact, this is almost exactly what people said 5-10 months ago.  That it wouldn't budge past 5k for the same reasons.
And I listened to those jackasses, thats why I didn't invest sooner.
My advice: Sky's the limit.  This is much different than a stock in that it's never been done before.  There has never been a logical competitor to all global currencies at once.  Just think about that for a second.  Never in the history of mankind has there been a logical currency competitor.  It was gold once, owned by governments and empires. Then it was fiat paper, owned by governments and empires.  Now magically out of thin air something props up that any joe-shmoe can invest into.  
Can you imagine, 3-5 years from now where bitcoin is a household name, not just a household idea?  I can. I don't even care if its used as currency, people are literally being shoved into understanding it and watching it grow... much like how Trump was all over TV, even though 1/2 the nation didn't want to watch his cheetoh face in any reality.  
Yes, I'm comparing Trump to Bitcoin; in the sense that no one gave two shits about Trump... until he was in the limelight.

So you are saying to use said created money to invest and make more money than the interest originally set.
What happens when you've paid all the interest back of the entire money creation process.
You literally cannot, because there isn't enough money in total creation to cover the total created + interest.

Which is also all fiat, and based off a system of interest.  Which eventually can never actually be paid back.

"secondly, they have a distributed network of mirrors - that's not a possibility for an exchange"
And you know this how?  A mirror is just another replicated server.  All servers work on the same principle, SOP (standard operating procedure).  Yes it is possible, and yes they should have taken these precautions. They would be VPN mirrors that are essentially off to the public until something like a crash occurs, instantly switching over the to the replicated environment.

Of course I don't, but I have a feeling of where gold isn't.  It's not that I have more confidence in Bitcoin, it is that I choose to believe it is a better altenative; at least from a concept point-of-view.  
The similarities between gold and bitcoin are massive.  The only real difference is that it can't be regulated whatsoever, which I love.  Nixon and the Fed regulating Gold is what got us into this mess.  Alternative virtual currencies have the potential to save our souls.

I didn't say to distribute.  I said to replicate.  The large transactions withdrawed WERE Mt Gox.  This was speculated and now proven. They said it themselves that they took the money out because they feared for the worst.  BUT, because they didn't have a replicated server environment, this all began with poor network infrastructure.
Since the database they are using is most like SQL-based, here is your requested strategy:
Now shush.
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:44:03
Because secure replicated servers can be taken offsite COMPLETELY, until actually necessary; you fucking moron.  If in terms of actual SQL (or whatever code they use) they replicated it over via VPN tunnelling, or via honeypot/honeyhive, then the DDoS'ers would have a difficult time finding the replicated servers.

@_date: 2013-04-11 14:25:35
It isn't the speculation, it is the speculation caused by outages at the exchanges. Every price drop in the last year has correlated to a bc exchange issue.
The exchanges need to get off their ass, and put in redundancies among redundancies.  It's just interesting when a website like Piratebay has like 100 DNS's at all times, to ensure stability, and we can't get the same type of SOP down for something that MAKES MONEY.

Because 19.3kg is how much gold weighs.  They worked around the weight, value, and amount of gold on the earth.  Since a standard rare currency worked.
Why 21?, not really 21, more like 20.  It is because fractional reserve is relatively easy upon it.  The maximum fractionalization for bitcoin is 40 quadrillion sub coins.  So it can be used as legitimate currency for roughly 10-20 years before a fresh digital currency is necessary.
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:13:31

"without fractional reserve." for the price I was referring to.  But yes of course there are more than 21mil oz's.  But as a currency, without fractional reserve, the reason gold stick at 1600 is that, that is the highest it can go to before (without fractional reserve) it is too expensive to use.

The point of redundancy is to allow for more bandwidth in a completely different area.  Could it also be DDoS'd?  Of course, but redundancy is the best strategy to allow for a steadier DDoS, and chances are if they secure their replicated server correctly, it would take days if not weeks for the DDoS'ers to re-plan their attack.  But my point is, for an operation this large, you dont have one replicated server, not 2, maybe 10?  That is how companies like Google (who are DDoS'd like crazy) do not go down. Simple as that.
Ask ANY Network Security Administrator.  And I am sure he will agree with me to some extent (of course if they are more educated than I, they may have an alternative).

Also I have answered all questions. Your magical argument is "you dont' know what your talking about". Just stop.
As an example, it is isn't about hiding the exchange you idiot, it is about hiding the replicated servers traces. By putting the REPLICATED SERVER in either a honeypot (yes that is a term used by network security analysts, it is a virtualized IP network where you can create virtual fake and/or real servers within it, you putz), or a VPN network (which basically IS a honeypot, just not as anonymous and/or fake since it is true/physical), you have a MUCH better chance of the DDoS'ers going after the wrong server. The point is this, the DDoS'ers have a limited amount of bandwidth to work with too. It is not like they have millions of dollars coming out of their ass.
Just admit you are too low level to argue with me. Just stop pretending you know more than you do. You sound like your in college, and just now getting into network security. I originally went to school for it, this was class 101 shit.

@_date: 2013-04-12 16:53:53
You are absolutely wrong.  You obviously don't know how replication happens.  Yes of course there would be a tad bit lost in the process from switching from a down server to an up server; BUT, not NEARLY as much as there is now.  We could have avoid 150 plunge, instead of a 200 plunge.  
Your credibility: none obviously

I said "Without Fractional Reserve".  You can't label 20 million coins at 4k, as no one on earth would buy them at that level; as they are not usable currency in that regard.

@_date: 2013-04-08 18:09:43
False.  Threshold is closer to something like $1000 without fractional reserve.
If you treat it like gold ($1600/oz being the threshold), you have to take into account that gold is a valuable resource (conductive, makes for chips, rings, used in certain cars, etc). Take roughly 1/3 the value off because of that factor.  You've got around a threshold of 1000. 
Obviously, no one knows the real threshold just yet, but it seems that way.

For some odd reason some of you seem to think that fiat currencies are backed by something.  Unfortunately some of you also don't realize that we use FIAT currency.  It isn't backed by anything, that is what makes it fiat.
Essentially the point I am trying to make here is this; governments are owned by corporations; corporations call the shots.  If that is the case, what will happen is that there will be a magic private organization similar to the RIAA going after Bitcoin users.  However the difference between this and lets say not paying your taxes or torrenting is that it is 100% anonymous.  So they would literally have to make a law that makes going to Bitcoin-esque sites completely illegal; and in that case we the BC users would just make the case that Paypal then is a form of currency and should be shut down, along with credit cards, along with every form of virtual trade.

Great answers! Not.
I didn't say that isn't possible, I said it is impossible without FRACTIONAL RESERVE.   FUCK.

I concur with you. Essentially by remaining at a minimum of 50, its still absolutely worth it. I expect it to once again stabilize at 200 in the next few days after Mt Gox hopefully and finally fixes their script issue.

Lentil, you are thinking about this wrong.  You can always get this cancelled by calling your credit card company and explaining to them that you haven't gotten your product.  The clause "All sales are final" do not  apply to a credit/debit card company; only to the company you are purchasing from.
So as an example, if you order the unit, and the system crashes, or you lose confidence, call your cc and get your money back. FDIC insured up to 250k.  The only real risk with all of this is the moment you receive your machine, or the moment it ships out rather.  Because many factors go into that obviously:
1. Does my machine work
2. Is it the right speed
3. Will it rank in enough to make up for it and power
Etc etc.  Life is about risks.  Do you have the balls is what it comes down to.
