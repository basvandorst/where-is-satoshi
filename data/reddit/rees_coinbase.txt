Hi, very sorry for the confusion on this!
We give merchants the option to refund or complete any mispaid orders, but we want to make the refund process as hassle free as possible for everyone involved. 
When you pay for an order but need a refund, depending on how the bitcoin transaction is structured, it can be problematic to assume that one of the given input addresses is under your control.  The last thing we want is  for a merchant to pick the wrong address and accidentally send your refund to someone else.
To keep things simple we've allowed merchants like Overstock the ability to refund bitcoins back to a Coinbase account controlled by your email address.  If you don't want to keep using the account, no problem, just use your email to log in and withdraw your funds to wherever you see fit, there is no requirement to verify a bank/phone/etc.
We're definitely open to suggestions on how to make this process easier + reliable.  Please feel free to message me on this!

I think this is an interesting idea, so instead of just a message you would also get line that allows you to specify your bitcoin address for a refund.  I'll forward this feedback to the merchant team.

Hi I'm very sorry for the ordering hassle!  Ideally when you want to pay a merchant it should be a simple process of seeing the address, sending a payment, and all parties involved get the correct confirmation.
I'm going to pass this feedback to our merchant team so we can make sure this kind of experience doesn't happen again.  If you ever see a similar issue, please send me a message at support and I will absolutely look into it

Hi thanks for bringing this up! I'd like to take a look at this and make sure we can help shut down the malicious sites hosting these phishing attempts. 
Can you please forward the headers of this email to support

At first glance this list appears to contain the forward facing information that was listed on merchant order buttons prior to April of 2013.  (possibly including merchant buttons made for testing purposes) 
The data here would include: 
* the url of the merchant order checkout page
* the name of the item being sold
* the cost of the item and currency denomination
* the merchant's username
* the email of the merchant 
It does not appear that additional pieces of information (such as phone numbers) are disclosed on this list.  The haveibeenpwned.com service can record emails located in any paste, and it's FAQ's state:


Regardless, I'd still like to give this our thorough attention.
