The bitcoin community seems the Linux community 10 years ago.
Absolutely jerk

What do you think about:
Just to say some..
Your is only some form of column-lists image.
Sorry but i think you should try to do better than this, if you want to please the community and (especially) the people not really involved into bitcoin.

These (3) infographics are simply TERRIBLE. The ugliest i ever seen.
Good shitty job

I emotionally compromised versus totally idiot people.
What's the problem to shift AT LEAST TEMPORARILY to a different pool?!
They do not want to loose a SINGLE penny as i wrote before.
This is unacceptable for a "hones player". and this behavior should be deprecated and banned by the community without adding a single word.

You could refund back the customer in USD
you could refund your Cu back in "weight BTC" (the medium price).
There are several sites that use this value,. right now for example on Bitsamp you have 881 USD, on MtGox 973, but the average right now is 897 (  )
Also recently i (try) to use a poker site that accept bitcoins but convert it to the market price and when you ask them back, they send to you the corresponding balance in btc (so if you send 10 USD today, and you ask them back in a month, they will for sure not be the same quantity).

Mmm it seems to me like the app has an update that "by defaults" has some preset password.
Also when Mycelium app updated some time ago,it was start to ask for the Pin, that if you didn't entered yet,was 0000.
So, eventually, ask to blackchain if they have some default password or install the same app on another device and play a bit with the settings to see if there is some default password secretly spotted somewhere.. :)
Good luck!

"Reason why miners like me won't leave GHASH.IO or won't stop purchasing cloud based mining power through CEX.IO"
A: Because I am an asshole. One of the worst. Because for some PENNYS or some satoshi i don't care about the balance or the good thing to do. Only what matters is the MONEY (usd).
Very good piece of shit. i wish you'll end burning in hell and some NICE guy will come to your nice wallet and steal EVERYTHING from that.
Good luck. ASSHOLE

I can understand what do u mean but i'm sorry i don't agree.
Miners nowdays has too much power. Mostly driven by people with shady purposes. They have $$$ and popolarity to drive consensus, so, if i can do something to oppose to this, i don't see why i should not.
Moreover miners can choose which transaction to validate based on the fees, that are based mostly of the resources they put to mine and validate a block.
So, why MY resources has to be shared _for free_ also with someone who is not sharing my very same vision?
I found that not fair at all.

It's not a matter of bandwidth but rather to "boycott" nodes and software that is not segwit ready.
i was thinking that if they are slowed down on sync their blockchain, maybe they will be forced to upgrade their software or push the dev to implement segwit.
Moreover, generally speaking, i found more problematic for a node, the disk i/o (shorter life) rather than bandwidth or space (at current blocksize limit)

Tnx guys for the explanation! ^__^

Totally agree.
Open Source "stuff" should embrace bitcoin in this way:
 &lt;bitcoin.h&gt;
There is absolutely no reason to not accept bitcoin payement/donation for them.
@_date: 2013-12-31 10:04:15
Wikipedia actually throws a lot of millions of $$$ in unproductive employees and useless offices.
So, how terrible will be to have the donations  publicly traceable to some specific addresses instead of others...

Bitcoin is for strong hearts and hands ;)
