Good analogy, contemporary view

Because it destroys families and whole communities.

And taxes aren't charity. It's not altruistic.
If you want to spend money to help people, start researching which charitable organization you like and give them money directly.
I've had this entire talk with friends. Paying of interest, just donate money instead. Maddening.

He didn't make an argument either way. Just gave you some good advice. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:33:57
You immediately went to the absurd.

Roads = fuel stations should build them. And they'll be more useful / efficient than any city planner could imagine. Customers would use the best roads, leading to the fuel station that has built / maintained it.
Anything that the state does through taxation is a detriment to progress.

Agreed. Those companies are sometimes created just for large infrastructure projects too. Think of the additional waste from that

I really like the idea of NASCAR style patches to visually relate who funds these policy makers.

It just means to regularly buy at set amounts, regardless of share / crypto value at the time. That way you buy more shares when it's low and fewer when high.
The goal is to purchase shares / crypto instead of thinking purely in $.

You've made an assumption that I want people to starve. This conversation is pretty much over. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:23:03
Quite the leap. How are your knees / ankles?

The house of representatives is anything but. 535 people cannot effectively represent the whole of the USA 
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:50:39
I shouldn't have just picked apart the words of your argument, sorry.
Agreed. Still needs principled discussion.

[Fiat currency's value is determine by government order (fiat).](
[The US Dollar/Currency supply is being increased (inflated) by $85billion per month.]( which will increase the currency available to government by 1 Trillion dollars per year. The US is receiving a lot of the dollars they sent overseas and is currently purchasing T-bills at a troubling pace for the last 2 years.
Fiat currencies always fail. So will the US dollar.

Colored coins will be your mortgage. A note on a coin(s) that is the title for property. Tying that property to that/those coins.
No loan needed. No credit. Pay everything off and the "loan" is paid off and the title is complete.

I'll go find it

Deflationary currency is wonderful. It's buying power increases over time. 
But Bitcoin cannot be deflated. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:36:51
That video was incredibly fucking inspiring

Inflation is a tool for government fiat currency and banks to invent currency so they get to spend it before consumers. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 14:34:44
Which drives prices down. It puts all markets squarely in the hands of the consumer / buyer.
Constant deflation is as bad as constant inflation though.

Not money, currency. There is a difference. Money has value, currency is stuff you move around. 
Bitcoin is amazing because it is both. 
Fungiblity of currency / money is important. Something durable that doesn't corrode or oxidize away. 
Think gold. It's value doesn't go up, but gold from the time of the ancient Egyptians still has value.
Currency is good, unless it's debased. Think of the Romans amalgamation of copper into their gold coins or the US dollar going off the gold standard.
Bitcoin cannot be debased. All cryptocurrency really.
It's the future. I love it.

I'm not the one making personal attacks. I'm having a tough time taking your aggressive manner in any way other than dismissal. Just saying, you might be right but I doubt anyone is going to take your virtual arm waving seriously.
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:03:06
You did it.
Many thanks.

I never thought about it like this. My crypto purchases make me feel like I'm living in the future and my 401k / IRA makes me feel like I'm in right-now mode.
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:10:31
Well, there is some measure of not paying fees / taxes for early withdrawal from 401k, so I'd either buy $20k btc through my 401k or $16k directly.
I'll ponder tomorrow and talk to more friends / smart folks 
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:57:05
I don't know, I was just having a lazy conversation with a friend over discord during a game of overwatch. He mentioned gbtc in regards to me thinking about cashing out a 401k I forgot about to just buy 20k in btc just because 
@_date: 2015-04-30 02:02:53
Depends on how much $10,000 will buy.
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:18:54
Exactly. I've got a couple old 401k's that I can afford to be bold with. I just don't want to get penalized like crazy by cashing them out, I'd rather setup a brokerage and buy gbtc

Specifically, it's value is by order (fiat) of the current governing body. 
Fiat = a formal authorization or proposition; a decree.
Government makes funny colored pieces of paper and wills them to have a value greater than the materials used to make them. Coins used to be made of base metals that had their own value (gold, silver). When you inevitably see the phrase debased currency, it describes a coin that has been made of materials cheaper than the denomination of said coin.

Fuck that. It buys my 10 year old 2000 Sq ft house that's at the edge of a town of with a population of 385,000. Not fucking rural.

It's not a matter being wealthy. It's a matter of potentially not owing someone money. It's incredibly freedom enhancing to be unencumbered.
