I didnt say that it is Bitcoin problem. Problem is in people this is how they control us. We are greed, have fear of loosing money, we are proud and we think that we are smartest of all specially people who involved in any kind of trading crypto, forex, enquity comodities. Problem is that everything used against us. Market controled by big money. Somebody taking big money out from this market thanks to manipulations and playing against crowd and those people do it if needed another 20 years while people keep buying. Basically what they do is playing against crowd sentiment. If there is 1000 bitcoins on buy side and  just 200 on sell those who control market will drive price lower.

Inflation is reason why 99% of this planet people are poor. Inflation is why our hard earned money every year losing value if not invested in some assets. Inflation is the main problem of this economy. Economy can function without inflation and its already proven. Inflation is rich boys tool to control poor ones.

True. And don't be surprised if same exchanges manipulate prices. Many retailers bitcoins are in exchange wallets so its easy for exchange to use those bitcoins against own clients. You sell at 100 buy back at 90 and again. People have to take out  all crypto from exchanges to remove liquidity all honest exchanges if any of them will survive. All who trade against clients will collapse like banks when people start to cash out from them.

very good said, he still thinks its bull market instead of selling spikes in bear market :)

Exactly same thing we see now in btc market. Question what to do how to stop it. One of the ways is decentralized exchanges. Because I am not sure that removing supply will help a lot because there will always be some coins in those fuckers hands to short.

I trust because its one of the oldest exchange. Because I do transfers from fiat to crypto or from crypto to fiat few times a month and it cost zero. My expierence with kraken support was good. So i dont see any reason why change exchange.

Those experts are peace of shit. If you trade predictions and expectations you always be looser

You think that 2% yearly inflation is real？It just goverment says that its 2% a year.  Answer one question how you gona save money when those money losing purchase power year after year. Prices rise more faster then wages？What if you know that 100euro or same 100$ will have same value after 50 years？Sadly it cant be like this, because it will destroy current debt based economy. Just to think some image

I was telking that for people long time ago that exchanges can use yours BTC agains own clients the only way to fight against that remove supply from exchange, same like people take fiat from banks all exchanges who trade against client will be forced to buy spot, or close bussnes

Same exchanges where you buy your bitcoin need just you money. Easy to proof look at profits of those exchanges. Or companys who make miners need you money. All ico need you money. In overal nothing has changed. Bitcoin over time will go to 0 if they just whant that because debt based economy alows to manipulate price.

No its not profitable to manipulate price up now because there is milions people siting on bitcoin longs so called hodl. Prices is always manipulated to liquidity. And liquidity defenetly not to upside. Look at binance, or any other exchange wallets you see a lot of bitcoins there people holding them in exchanges and thats bad. Bitcoin not need 3rd party to hold (bank) they have to take out everything from exchange to personal wallets. Because btc is limited supply the only way to create manipulation is to trade against own clients using clients bitcoins for shorting.

You absolutly right was saying that once bear trend was established at begining of the last year.   People are crazy and dont like when somebody goes against horde expectations but below 3k is a good buy based on weekly chart. Bottom will be established when market shows that it is trending higher. Now there is no single sign for bottom.

There is no bear or bull there is just dump people who pays smart people bills and at the same time fights agains eatch other. All market is like this I buy and I sell for idiot who agrees to buy at higher price from me.
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:06:02
exchanges selling btc at lows those exchanges not regulated and have clients bitcoins so they can play against clients easy as that. More people buy more it goes down classic situation when sentiment goes to short all those laveraged traders will pay every fee.

Funny thing is institutions getting in. Lol. Bitcoin capitalization is less then any stock from top 50 probably so there is no institutions money stop this bullshit its just pure speculations in searching bigger fool. Its fools market with low liquidity where you buy and waiting to sell on any pump. And those who buys after pump is basically pays bills.
