I hope it doesn’t get below 9k any predictions on what peak will be this year? I’m saying peak of 35k
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:48:03
Play the long game next time. HODL
@_date: 2019-07-18 19:38:04
Man she was whipping those answer out! Great to have representation like that.
@_date: 2019-07-18 19:39:09
Too soon
@_date: 2019-07-15 00:19:46
Glad I’m not the only one.
@_date: 2019-07-26 03:24:24
It would definitely help build awareness and the more people use it the easier it will be for adoption.
@_date: 2019-07-25 00:05:20
I’m not putting my entire paycheck, but i generally buy a little each pay period. And not just bitcoin FYI diversification is key.
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:57:41
Today maybe I’m swimming in red on the crypto side but my traditional stocks are helping me float.
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:42:53
You could buy a G6
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:59:37
Finding the file shouldn't be hard it's getting the key phrase. You may have negotiate that a little. Good luck though.
@_date: 2019-07-24 21:00:22
Well that could be promising then!
@_date: 2019-07-27 18:12:37
Anyone else feel like you can’t sleep when it’s good and  well cant sleep when it a bad? Might as well sleep while I’m HODLing.
@_date: 2019-07-17 19:12:14
Seems legit let’s run with it
@_date: 2019-07-25 01:39:12
Thanks my first tip FYI!
@_date: 2019-07-24 18:58:06
So I’m probably like a bunch who are waiting for their paycheck to buy more but this is low.
@_date: 2019-07-15 00:38:57
I think that’s fair that halfing is the wildcard next year
@_date: 2019-08-19 00:34:19
Is this using a 4 hour chart or a 2 hour chart?
@_date: 2019-08-18 20:54:37
I do wonder if bitcoin being more of an asset doesn’t hurt its future viability because it’s not being utilized as intended. Before you jump down my throat I am Hodling but do think that bitcoin is best when used day to day.
@_date: 2019-08-26 03:53:08
That lasted all of... well that’s all it lasted.
@_date: 2019-08-27 15:09:16
That’s 5Ge so what 4g should have been.
@_date: 2019-08-27 17:04:23
Your assuming that minivan isn’t his lambo already!
@_date: 2019-08-15 15:31:16
Well if anything holding had made me more aggressive in saving and not being freaked out by dips. FOMO is less of a thing and long term goals become more important.
@_date: 2019-08-15 17:43:33
I was just about to post this article. Great read and great way of talking to people about bitcoin in a different coherent method.
@_date: 2019-10-16 23:43:22
I think this is great! Plus a good thing to point to when people say it harbors illegal activity. Really cool how they traced the wallets.
@_date: 2019-08-15 22:52:06
Haha I have had FOMO a week before my check so I can buy in more lol.
@_date: 2019-08-19 22:43:25
At Starbucks, Target, the DMV, Grocery Store. Heck even the homeless guy on the corner will have a BTC QR code. Mass adoption
@_date: 2019-08-15 17:47:49
Nice so proves that over time BTC is a great investment. If you have micro focus on the day to day you will lose but if you gaze is on the long term then the moon should be in your horizon.
@_date: 2019-08-06 15:11:23
Now did the moon come down to us or did we go up to the moon in this drawing? Technical analysis are so hard to interpret.
@_date: 2019-10-26 23:58:52
We would need a 90% pump to get to 16k that would be impressive in 5 days.
@_date: 2019-12-10 17:56:07
In theory yes. But I'm getting worried about the government intervention of Bitcoin so I fear they will tame the market.
@_date: 2019-12-06 00:51:40
Unfortunately those newer to BTC may get wrecked but hopefully this doesn’t burn them on BTC.
@_date: 2019-12-10 18:00:42
The limit is the size of your wallet not your Nano.
@_date: 2019-12-19 22:43:01
This is the movie that made me get into bitcoin. The way that funds are managed is just insane.
@_date: 2019-12-09 03:04:32
Be careful what you wish for not all action is bullish.
@_date: 2019-12-05 22:17:31
Robinhood lets you wager on the price of bitcoin but doesn't affect bitcoin. So you don't really end up owning any of it. It's convenient but not true bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-09 23:57:14
Haha I would love for this to be a direct quote lol.
@_date: 2019-12-05 22:48:22
No, let me say it in Spanish "no" Dollar-cost average and just hold your coin for a long time. Bitcoin is promising but also highly volatile. You could be up 80% and down 80% in minutes.
@_date: 2019-12-07 17:46:22
I saw that video totally backwards bitcoin should have been the lone guy fighting back against the bears and the government.
@_date: 2019-12-10 22:44:30
The anonymous nature could be seen as a reason to ban however I find it to be the most compeling reason to own. I don't think that goverments or corporations should be able to profile me to the extent that they know who I am and what I buy. 
The ability to get around sanctions, although countries that are sanctioned have other means to develop their own currency in Africa people use prepaid minutes as a currency. 
The quantity of money that can be sent without oversight. Someone can transfer you a billion dollars without filling a report.
@_date: 2019-12-04 17:52:59
Yeah....this is not a good sign for bitcoin. Plus Bakkt is now a futures market and not even settling physical bitcoin so this is just another attempt to inflate the market and crush it's potential.
@_date: 2019-12-10 17:53:31
Tell that to Bakkt
@_date: 2019-12-05 21:52:40
Bitcoin because the truck will depreciate and bitcoin will only keep going up.
@_date: 2019-12-05 21:55:23
I think the whales moving their bitcoin before proof of keys is a strategic move to protect themselves from the crash of the exchange. I don't keep any on exchanges so I'm good but I feel fearful for those left holding the bag.
@_date: 2019-09-13 23:56:34
Is this date accurate because with more hash rate isn’t the halving suppose to happen sooner because it’s based on block not time
@_date: 2019-09-11 16:36:12
Don't give out your private key to anyone that offers you help. Especially if they private message you. If you give it out to anyone it's game over. So many scammers out there. I'm guessing you don't have access to the wallet physically and are trying to retrieve it remotely.
@_date: 2019-09-11 17:29:40
Curious follow up question would bitcoin benefit from a recession. After being how bitcoin became a safe haven in Argentina and HK would it see that same effect.
@_date: 2019-09-16 19:45:50
Yeah I'm getting more bearish on Bakkt coming out soon. But I'm Bullish in the long run for BTC
@_date: 2019-09-11 17:23:58
I'm no economist but shouldn't we be raising the rate so that we keep inflation under control and also give us more power to fight a recession like everyone feels we are heading into?
