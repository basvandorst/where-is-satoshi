How true. Please have 1$ in old Fiat currency transfered to you by the fuel. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 12:37:18
I think you meant cloudmining. Because i own the machines and i have a contract with the datacenter there is no middlemen doing the ponzi :)

mining and reinvesting is a repeating circle. if i have to calculate the fiat money i invested i would really loose every single day. but because i do only calculate BTC which i ve earned before this is a factor i do not count. thanks god. :-)
you asume a situation in wich i would have to install 18th at the current market. that really doesnt work out. now is not the time to buy hardware. now its time to buy coins, wich will push the price north.
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:15:02
Why not from my mouth?
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:47:30
Not as much as some believe.
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:14:51
i would suggest you people to tip also in or better :-)
@_date: 2014-10-05 12:30:45
There are miners who immedietaley sell and the ones who dont. I think it is important for doing the right thing at the right time. And because more are selling wich drives the Price down there is no speculating at the Moment.
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:45:13
no i write the hardware cost off for tax reasons not for looking profitabel. but in a business case you do not calculate to getting back your investment the next few months. i do not calculate to make an profit the first years either.
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:54:46
Great thank you
@_date: 2014-06-14 14:13:06
I am with you. I have a strategy. I provide P2Pool Nodes for everybody not willing to install and maintain their own node. You can choose between a location near your miner fow lowest latency. Amsterdam, New York and San Franciso.
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:23:29
I am in for the money. :)

Hey Mister Igel, i remember your seller page and the fantastisc explanation regarding bitcoin and the Info.
wish you all the best!
Are u around munich sometime?
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:04:26
go to bitnode.io and get your own maintained node. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:26:49
Yes we are not only loosing value in BTC, we are also loosing in the hardwarefront... 
$/GH/s will come down too in the near future, 
Vendor or used miner.
@_date: 2014-04-16 14:02:38
i do not want to blame on someone. just open your eyes and you will see sockpuppets everywhere. thats how some companys do social media work. there is a whole new industry if you maybe have noticed. :-)
if you have a strange feeling about someones post than check his post history. thats it. that was my intention to make this post.
HINT: Do not check my post history ;-) uiuiui
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:18:20
i can say that i pay per KW/h and i really love spondoolies tech hardware because those are for datacenters build.

the answer to 1 &amp; 3 is yes.
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:29:46
Ok understand. Thanks tough, i do make Profit. Also quarterly.
Maybe i wasn t clear, english its not my native Language.
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:24:19
Petamine can get a few private nodes with bitnode.io
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:49:12
may i ask how big your operation is?
@_date: 2014-06-14 14:21:58
good question. i think it will create a blake hole and will suck up all altcoins :D
@_date: 2014-10-05 12:27:41
I think the cost of mining is not the only thing when it comes to the Price of BTC.
As long as there is not a single entitiy out there mining all the coins it is not becoming centralised. It still decentralised. But there will be fewer Player in the Game.
@_date: 2014-10-07 07:08:01
After reading this phenomenal bullish article it feels like: what was that thing two days ago? Bearwhale? 
It does not matter :)
Thanks for reminding me!
@_date: 2014-09-20 11:20:27
it took me watching two times before realizing that the sentence "we need to figure out how to make these people use Bitcoin" is NOT in the ad.
i just realized i am one of the users :-)
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:31:58
Yes exactly. You dont have to maintain a node on your own. Just point your miner to it and mine on the p2pool with your own node. 
But wait, its getting better. Your Bitnode also run a Bitcoin Node supporting the Network overall AND mine on with your own P2Pool Node, supporting the Network again.

Change it for Fiat Puff Daddy. Bring them girls on :)

You cant scale your setup. So i think no at the end. First it will Look like beeing profitable, but a Big Ovation will be profitable when they scale.

Yes thats basically how it works.
Adoption needs time, but it is happening.

Hey it is printed on paper. It wont be read by lots of People.
And WTF? Bitcoin is Run by the foundation? Do your Research before publishing!
I am a long time miner.
I mine you long time ;)

wow we are living in the future! the possibility to loose your wallet and recover it instantly if you restore it with your passphrase. if you can remember your passphrase you even can do it underway. just go to your nearest apple store and demand an iPhone. You can pay it afterwards you restored your money on your new  Phone.
hahaha :D
do you fuki'n understand :D:D:D
it is truly amazing!
@_date: 2014-10-05 12:53:53
Interesting thoughts. 
I do not tend to overweight the price of bitcoin and thats give me a good sleep these days. 
Reinvestment are key to success, you have to keep up with the ever growing hashrate and your competition, but right now it would not be good to reinvest because of the low price. it simple doesnt math out.
i do reinvest if the coins are going up, if they dont go up i have not to reinvest because my competition also will slow down installing new hardware.
@_date: 2014-09-14 17:12:48
Yes kill that account!
@_date: 2014-09-20 23:12:16
Sorry but i dont think you ve understand the sugesstion OP is making. He knows that bitcoin is more than paypal. But average Joe or people reading German BILD do not understand. A simpler explanation would help spreading the word for the People outside of r/bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-20 14:50:12
because KNC is so big the public attention is much higher than with bitmine.ch for expample who does not deliver for more than 6 month and does not refund people. look at bitminerefund.com more than $200k open. and the estimated number of unknown cases is for sure much much higher!
@_date: 2014-10-02 18:31:34
Karpeles was much more an Enemy to bitcoin as the 600k Lost coins you believe.
He is still slowing the Adoption 
@_date: 2014-09-19 08:24:56
another sign how far we have come.
if the bankster's and the fed are talking about bitcoin there is no reason to believe bitcoin isnt a currency.
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:53:09
thats a good one :-)
@_date: 2014-12-08 21:49:23
yes you did a great Job in adoption :)
indeed that would be great.
I am around Marienplatz. Just give me a sign. We can also have Glühwein :)

Because you Support the Network.
@_date: 2013-09-06 16:51:15
Shit up and give it to me
@_date: 2013-04-15 05:09:34
Yes it s Time for a relaunch.
When i developed the Site there was no html 5.
@_date: 2013-04-15 18:10:15
oops, missunderstood you :-)
Yes thats definitely my place!
@_date: 2013-08-20 21:07:01
Holy Shit. That could be me saying this. Except the Jeep
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:42:20
it's marked, sorry for that.
@_date: 2013-04-15 04:45:33
I developed the Site in 2009. didnt saw any Sites.
@_date: 2013-08-03 12:55:03
Actually nobody seems surprised about the ticketprice??
@_date: 2013-08-20 18:53:57
@_date: 2013-08-16 21:04:35
You could split Hashrate and compare Pools. Waht else?
@_date: 2013-08-27 21:10:35
Yes!! :)
@_date: 2013-04-15 04:57:05
As you can see this is more like a kind of hobby project. I never made any money out of this.
The wallet Adress mentioned is a New One. In the past i used a wallet Adress from tipit. Anybody remeber that Site? They were a Donation Provider. Pretty Bad conversion Rate, But Easy to use.
But i think it didtn work out for them, they went Down in the meantime.
In more than three years i got 0,7 bitcoins donated.
So this is possible the worst Business idea ever. :)
But believing in bitcoins is the right Thing!!
@_date: 2013-08-28 09:35:48
Does she give you at least some satoshi's?
@_date: 2013-04-15 07:06:03
yes you are right. i forgot to moved them out. thank you.
@_date: 2013-04-15 09:39:22
ARP Spoofing or MtM Attacks didnt work in that case, because every webserver reside's in its own subnet.
@_date: 2013-08-26 05:37:04
Is there any interest in hosted hashing or Cloud mining? 
I would Love to hear your opinions.
@_date: 2013-04-15 12:52:50
Yes i have to relaunch the Site with HTML 5 and responsive design, so it will also fit in any mobile screen
@_date: 2013-05-05 19:39:04
@_date: 2013-08-16 14:30:52
i'll spend my first bitcoin when it becomes enough to buy me a elan 333 :-) or maybe a elan 340.
@_date: 2013-08-23 15:04:38
îf the network Hashrate sinks, because every mining rig explodes, the Difficulty will also sink.
@_date: 2013-08-20 08:10:21
Wow. Thank you. That has made my Day :-)
@_date: 2013-08-27 06:43:14
You mean something like EMA's?
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:51:27
i maintain the site on my own, there was never some income for paying hosting costs. its all on my own. but i always believed in the power of bitcoins, so i removed two years ago all ads.
if everybody help's spreading the word about bitcoin, and no matter how small your business or whatever is. accept bitcoins helps all of us in the near future.
@_date: 2013-04-15 13:05:36
You can check the "make safe(r) for work" option in your reddit preferences, and it will hide NSFW thumbnails.
@_date: 2013-08-13 19:32:51
Dont you think the increase can not be that high in the future? If we hit a total hashrate at 1.000 THash/s a increase of 35,9% would be an additional hashingpower with 359 THash/s or did i just calculate Bullshit?!? :-)
@_date: 2013-08-27 21:01:47
No she is Petty interested and Supports me also with the mining. :)

The Problem is every Scammer reduces the global Trust into bitcoin. Every Bad News about bitcoin mean that there could be User thinking Bad about bitcoin. In the end we got all less out From our Investment.
@_date: 2013-04-15 06:28:02
Thank you. they have to fap :-) 
i never mind getting money out of it. i had fun developing this site. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 04:48:02
Thats a Good idea. I shouLd give it a try. :)
@_date: 2013-08-14 11:07:06
But you miss the Fact that neather hashfast or cointerra has shown working prototypes.
@_date: 2013-04-15 12:51:41
thank you very very much!

@_date: 2013-08-14 11:18:59
no easy question. i was in the exactly same position as you. i have read almost the whole knc thread on bitcointalk, every bit of information i could find regarding knc and orsoc. and i payed for 2 saturn. 
i cannot say that they will deliever on time. or deliver anyway. and in october everything can look diferent again. 
but it think knc is the best horse you can bet these Difficulty Times :-)
