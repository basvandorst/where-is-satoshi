And it coincides with futures coming online. The bears can finally short Bitcoin and lots of big time traders are bearish on it. 
You would be disgusted to hear how many of these wallstreet types don't even understand the technology of blockchain let alone can see it's future. All they see is magic internet money that doesn't physically exist. Just like your online dollars. And in that context, there's nothing special about it and being against it is the the right move.

you guys know bitcoin cash is objectively better and more likely to survive? Bitcoin is only still around cuz it’s synonymous with cryptocurrency. It actually sucks when you get down to the nuts and bolts. After this huge correction, the big players will reallocate their funds toward better technology like ethereum.

Probably big shakers getting on. Something with the marketcap of bitcoin can't spike this much without big movers doing something.

Good intentions aren't enough though. 
But yes, there are scams out there. Be patient, be conservative, be gradual. This change isn't going to happen overnight. A shift of currency technology is really fucking major.

Sure. 
They might also be trying to apply downward pressure on the price rise to prevent a bubble and a subsequent giant correction. They might honest to god see the writing on the wall. But you can't just replace a currency technology that's existed for thousands of years. A steadier, slower rise is healthier. Healthier price action also attracts large traders and further legitimizes it. 
Gradual change is better for everyone. It lets the kinks get worked out and the technology optimized.

Would you say the internet is a scam? Of course not. It's the most powerful technology in the entire fucking world right now. 
In the early days of big, earth shattering changes in economies, dumbasses overextend cuz they don't understand the principles of the disruption. They just know it's big big big and jump on every train they can. 
The scam internet sites were found out leaving behind Facebook, Google, yahoo, media companies, etc. the same will happen with crypto.

Even if it's a little bit of investment, you can't  afford NOT to invest. There is a HUGE asymmetric risk here.
