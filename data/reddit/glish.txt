I perhaps got ahead of myself as I'm a dropout and my QED education consists of misunderstanding Feynman's books and internet comments.
What about walking through a wall? I see that cited as a common example of what can happen with quantum mechanics. I also understood that particles could all shift in the same direction at the same time, so jumping over a building seemed like it'd fit.

They work to the extent that the mixer's pool and transactions are enough to prevent traffic analysis. They work to the extent you trust the mixer not to keep logs or be operated by a hostile entity. 
If your volumes are big enough or the entity untrustworthy, it's trivially pierced.

That would require, like, getting outside and risking my life in a car.

I'm sorta amazed Gox recovered after we all got spammed to death from the folks that dumped their database. I only recently (couple months ago) started looking at bitcoin again and was astonished that MtGox was still around.

A frog jumping over a tower *is* possible. Quantum mechanics, whee?

Quantum mechanics - you could drop a fork and it could fall through the Earth. It's possible, but extremely unlikely.
Solving a block is not "win the lottery" unlikely, but "I walked through a wall" unlikely.
So unless you're being pedantic or a mathematician, no, it's not possible. The chance is practically indistinguishable from zero.

Right, but essentially everything is possible if you use that definition. A frog jumping over the Sears Tower is possible with that definition. But that's such a worthless definition unless you're doing math.

Thanks for the clarification. So they didn't keep enough reserves, and they can't buy enough via MtGox and other exchanges?
The site also clearly states they reached the 24-hour limit on orders, apart from the fact that they won't place the order until Friday night.
