Who set it into the wild? Who built the underlying protocol? Who cares who the developers are? All the developers do is make very small changes with relation to convenience. They already done the damage of setting it loose.

How is it bad? It will make whoever got in first have the most wealth, aka the globalists behind the U.S. government have seized a large stockpile of the coins from 1) Satoshi himself 2) All the Goxxings 3) The Silk Road 4) Seed orgs who create the mining equipment like KnC (They hold everything they mine, how do you think it got to 11bn market cap). The globalists created the encryption method behind the currency and therefore will best know how to crack it in the future. When Bitcoin succeeds, it will be a one world currency, with complete transparency, they will know what you do on a daily basis. Everything is on the public ledger, all they will have to do is make it compulsory to have your ID tied to your Bitcoin addresses. It will be developed further. The USA's fake wealth has gone on for too long and is nearing collapse, this is an escape avenue for them, war will probably break out because of it. They will own the world without having to raise a sword (in theory, whether foreign governments will see through it is another story altogether).
