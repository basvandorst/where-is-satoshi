Not irrelevant.  Coinbase is not a bank in Colorado.  If I deposit bitcoin purchased from Coinbase into my wallet it is none of their business where that bitcoin goes after that transaction. The same way if I walk into my bank and exchange a $100 bill into smaller bills.  It is none of their business where that money goes.
 If they trace transactions several hops out then this needs to be known by the larger community.

Won't be using this.  I linked to my account and got the test deposits.  I try to buy $10 worth of bitcoin and wait, wait, wait, for three days I wait.  Failed.  Checked my bank and sure enough the test withdrawal taking back their original deposits worked.  All of this was happening while bitcoin was tanking in price.  In the meantime I went to Coinbase and bought coin.  Coins bought and heading into my offline wallet in a matter of minutes.  People keep saying just how great Circle is but from my experience Coinbase has been a no frills experience from day one.  I'll stick with them until there is a reason not to.
EDIT:  oh yeah and my ticket to Circle support took six days for a response and was worthless.

I'm not sure this will ever be possible.  There will always be a trace.  Best you could do is close all your bank accounts and credit cards they have records, move somewhere else, and start using new wallet addresses that have no association with anything coinbase has ever seen or linked to any previous wallet addresses or payments.

"Ready to answer your Bitcoin questions, ASK US ANYTHING!"
It's a valid question that they probably won't give a straight answer to.  Do you really think holding bitcoin is going to make them a target beyond what they are already are?  I don't think so.
I'd rather see a "I don't know" or "I cannot give you the answer" over a politician style deflection.

Anything I sell on Ebay I automatically say 10% is pissed away at both Ebay and PayPal fees.  A while back they even had the balls to charge me something about shipping surcharges or something.  Even though I charge, let's say, $10 to ship something and it ended up costing me $11 for actual shipping paid to the postal service (not even counting materials, drive time to the post office, waiting in line, etc), Ebay charged me some stupid shipping surcharge fee.  They haven't done that in a while but man that pissed me off.  I welcome OB and will certainly be testing it out.
(I'm low volume on Ebay with just a total of 105 or so buy/sells mainly because I hate the fees)
@_date: 2014-06-06 15:59:36
fiat for papper wallet.  So if you wanted $500 of btc and I charged $10 for the transaction then bring $510 fiat and I have a encrypted paper wallet that is worth $500 btc at the time the deal was agreed upon since the value is usually up or down.   Cryptocards would be great except it adds additional price to the trade AND once the buyer and seller both know the password, I would never trust that wallet again.

Has Overstock ever said how much they were saving with the customers using bitcoin?  Example, if they sold $200k worth of merchandise and people used bitcoin instead of credit cards I wonder what their savings ended up being.  I'm guessing at least 3%.  Would be curious to know what they say.

The problem was I never really got to try it.  Everything looked good.  The problem was when my checking account was being linked.  Their test deposit and withdraw went fine, no problems.  When I tried to do a test $10 purchase it took three (or four?) days in limbo before I finally got a notice saying it didn't work.  No reason why there should be a problem especially since their test deposit/withdraw was performed.  After contacting support it took them almost a week to even respond.  0 problems ever with Coinbase up to that point so it wasn't worth the hassle going from one to the other so I deleted all of my checking info off of Circle.

@_date: 2014-06-06 15:47:10
If I ever did this in person this is how it would go.  At least it sounds good in my head.
Meet in public place like a cafe but away from a lot of public distractions like a huge market, have a encrypted paper wallet, allow buyer to scan public address to see funds, get $$, give password and allow buyer to sweep.  While this is going on we could talk about how crappy credit card or paypal fees are and about the weather.  After 10 mins or so the 1st confirmation should be coming through and the deal is done, we part ways.  Only the buyer's phone is involved and the only thing I have produced is a piece of paper that is worthless without a password.   
Of course there are other things that could go wrong but I think the above probably is pretty safe for most transactions.
   
@_date: 2014-01-26 18:39:18
I don't buy from TD and never will.  If stores like Costco, Target, farmers markets, mom &amp; pop, or other places that I shop start taking it then I will use bitcoin there.  Here is why
*) No chance of my account being compromised.  (forget the liability limits and such.  Why put myself at risk to begin with)
*) I hate credit cards, debit cards, and everything that makes mom and pop have to pay merchant fees
*) Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are the future.  Customers adopting it early tells retailers that it has a serious future and not something they should ignore.
For online, I would use only credit cards for now unless it is a trusted site that has a track record having excellent customer service.  Amazon, REI, and Costco.com are the ones that come to mind right now. For those three sites I would gladly use bitcoin.  
@_date: 2014-10-03 01:17:11
I did a couple of test transfers in and out using only bitcoin and was happy with the speed.

I'll probably just keep using Coinbase instead.

How much were you trying to transfer?  I've seen reports where $3k and higher were flagged.  US Bank has been good to me (so far) but I'm not doing any high dollar transactions.

This is for a immediate or overnight payment.  The normal bill pay takes at least three (?) days before the bill is paid.  So if I tried to pay a bill through the Bill Pay service on the 1st the next available bill pay date available would be on the 4th or 5th.  For 14.95 (per bill I think) it could be the next day.  It's basically some scheme cooked up to make money off people that can't (or won't) schedule bill pay a few days ahead of time.  Normally on the 1st I would schedule a bill to be paid on the 6th and it would be free.

With the amount of credit reports and other BS employers are doing for applicants, sir you are very lucky to have landed the job.  Glad to see you are in good financial shape now.

When I read the Coindesk article a few minutes ago I got excited.  Reading some of the comments on Reddit about Xapo, I'm going to be cautious and let other people test it out first. :)
Hopefully this will stand the test of time and a year from now be a commonly used card.  At least I hope so.

I always put in bitcoin accepted in my Craigslist posts but to date never had anyone interested in using that as payment.  
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:39:54
Best wishes!

Yes.  I'll take it.  (I predict lots of gift card usage in my future)

Mycelium or Wallet32.  Mycelium is what I have used for the past year with 0 issues.

Best wishes to you on the buys.  I'll probably pick up another full bitcoin soon.

Colorado and Oregon need to be on that list.

Surprised they didn't add something about protecting children in there.  It's always all about protecting against terrorism and protecting our children.  "Financial crime" is okay if banks do it though.

My money went with Trezor.  I'm not so broke that I can't support the original devs for their hard work.
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:11:33
It's probably more like 95%
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:57:08
I can't believe we haven't heard anything from the foundation about why Gox is still a member.  They should be cut away like the cancer they are so bitcoin can live again.  This is BS.
@_date: 2015-05-27 18:18:16
Excellent.  Thanks!
@_date: 2014-09-17 21:47:33
I don't think so but considering I just signed up for a invite spot last month I can't imagine I'm anywhere near getting one.
@_date: 2015-07-08 16:59:10
Can someone ELIF a bit?   If I do the standard .0001 fee what happens?  and then if I do a .0002?   Are all of these unconfirmed transactions because of zero fees or really low fees?

Any news on a version update yet?

Pretty awesome

The IOS version doesn't come close.  I've been trying for 10 minutes to send funds and it doesn't work... then I find this thread.  Had to do it on my Moto X and it took two seconds.

I hate bits.  I'd rather see .0001 btc than 100 bits.

There is no reason to believe in another five years* that returns couldn't be posted to a btc address instead of a checking account. Let's hope so.

I think this had to do with the SXSW $5 promo they were doing.  My guess is they were having backend problems with everyone trying to grab .017 btc.
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:40:17
Subject should have said "KEPT the free $5 in bitcoin they gave me"

Wake me up when PayPal lets you withdraw in bitcoin instead of your checking.

Another Trezor + Electrum vote.  Great combo
@_date: 2015-10-20 21:26:56
okay thanks. This helps.

So is anyone using US Bank with this and if so have you had any problems?  Do these show as coinbase transactions or something else?  How does a credit card figure into this (if it does)?

If I had .01 for every time I wanted to say something similar to the first three paragraphs.

I do like the black, a lot, but having fur kids means black is a no-no for me.

I'd consider buying one in white.

Adding to this thread are there any that can import BIP38 encrypted qr codes?  I'm moving over from android and a little shocked that breadwallet, bitwallet, and mycelium apparently cannot do it.
@_date: 2015-02-25 03:26:28
Anyone know what the minimum amount they consider to be a large transaction?

Not worth crap if they are down for maintenance.

Has something changed?  Last time I bought btc taken out of my checking account it was in my offline wallet within a few minutes. Even on my first buy it only took four days.
@_date: 2015-02-13 03:06:13
It's missing a lot of features

Interesting.  I thought Apple were punks for their 30% cut but it looks like Google is just as bad.
