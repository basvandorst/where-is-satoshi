"Sovereign Curtis," huh? Should his conviction be nullified because there was gold fringe on the courtroom flag?
@_date: 2014-02-14 17:01:45
He's gotten a lot chunkier since then. Guess all that sword practice was burning some calories.

What makes bitcoin a better choice for this purpose than... pretty much anything else?
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:44:43
So that means the government should steal money from the rest of us to replace your failed investment?? 
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:58:18
It means you're now guilty of selling stolen goods. Please turn yourself in at the nearest police station.
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:11:41
Nah, you're fine, post it. Don't listen to these chumps.

Don't go to *any* Starbucks, until they accept BitCoin.

"File for losses" Who do you expect to get the bitcoins back from, the government? Fuck you, welfare leech.
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:42:46
**Here's** a guy who gets it!!
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:23:07
I just have to ask. Do you still have the dog dick coffee table?
@_date: 2014-02-11 15:59:30
So rehost Wikipedia as a distributed system.
@_date: 2014-02-12 20:37:49
No, here's the reason the app was removed: 


@_date: 2014-02-10 21:54:55
Isn't that what insurance is for?
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:22:25
Actually, this is good news
@_date: 2014-03-11 23:22:50
I am sincerely curious how you managed to get JPEG artifacts in a PNG. I'm going to guess that if I go back through your submission history, I'll see that you posted this as a JPEG first, and got downvoted, with people telling you to submit it as a PNG, so you converted the already-ugly JPEG to a PNG and resubmitted it.
Nope, unless you deleted that post out of shame. Now I'm even more confused.
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:33:37


I thought it didn't bother you? Why are you just *now* trying to erase history?
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:19:41
At least the other guy was blatant about the fact that he was posting a referral.
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:19:43
Doesn't that just serve to regulate what people post? And Cloudflare sites don't seem to have any trouble keeping their caches in sync...
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:47:21
@_date: 2014-02-14 17:02:47
As long as you don't meet the seller in a dark Wal-Mart parking lot. Otherwise you're going to get hacked in a more literal sense.

Smash them both and switch today. If she can't appreciate Freedom then she's not worth it.
@_date: 2014-02-20 00:06:40
Where were chargebacks even mentioned in this story?
Oh, I get it. You're saying that if the OP could do a chargeback, he wouldn't have been screwed out of his money.
@_date: 2014-02-11 16:12:13
You can already do this. Just rehost Wikipedia on Cloudflare.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:33:10
Good for the users, I guess, but as a miner I'm barely making a profit as-is. I think I'm just going to sell off my hardware now while I can still get some money for it.

@_date: 2014-02-16 17:37:59
Look dude, don't come bitching to me in PMs about being "doxxed" for using the same username to do PR for a company after defending your dog dick coffee table on a BitCoin forum. The fact that you didn't already wipe that shit from the internet before now is unbelievable.
@_date: 2014-02-12 17:18:37
You should read the post? He/she went right to the police station afterward.
@_date: 2014-02-13 04:57:12
For those unaware, this is literally the OP (the one on the couch)
@_date: 2014-02-12 20:34:06
Wow. So judgmental.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:18:32
And publishing this information in articles about their new University-sponsored club?
@_date: 2014-02-11 22:32:54
Freaking epic, OP!
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:03:05
I'm using your creation to tell you to go fuck yourself! lol!
@_date: 2014-02-13 01:14:11
Freaking epic, OP! Shibe doge ftw!

@_date: 2014-02-28 21:59:26
S/he is asking if s/he can file for losses to "get some back." That's hardly the same as adjusting their tax return.
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:21:38
He'll probably seppuku before they get to him, anyway.
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:19:28
Smoke weed every day.
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:12:45
Rude and ignorant.
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:09:21
Go nuts! I'm not dumb enough to leave a dog dick paper trail across the internet.
@_date: 2014-02-11 17:48:53
Once you rehost it, the Wikipedia admins wouldn't have any power over it. Anybody could post whatever they wanted. Still not seeing what value Bitcoin adds.
@_date: 2014-02-09 23:32:22
Don't shit your pants, dude
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:40:55
Hell yes. Glad to see more restaurants offering gluten-free options.
e: Wait, this was supposed to be about the bitcoin sign on the front? Who gives a fuck about that?
@_date: 2014-02-11 16:49:27
How do they determine the exchange rate? I thought  M.T.G.O.X. was the standard, but now they're down...
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:28:37
Wow, rude. :/ I thought we were trying to be welcoming here... Can you please explain it for the rest of us, at least? I'm curious.
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:52:22
So you're saying that it was never her car, because you kept the title. So what did she give you six thousand actual dollars for?
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:02:16
That's a really insensitive way to speak to someone who just lost their best friend.
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:14:24
But in Magic: the Gathering Online Exchange's case, the BitCoins were stolen by someone else, so Magic The Gathering Online Exchange aren't 'stealing' the BitCoins - they're just gone. Maybe if we had some kind of, I don't know, deposit insurance?
@_date: 2014-02-14 17:03:21
Holy shit, can you fuck a bitcoin now?
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:27:47
Nice to see an official statement from the Bitcoin Foundation!
e: wait, what the hell is the "bitcoin association"?

This meme is going to the moon!! 
@_date: 2014-02-12 00:55:35
This comment might make sense if the FDIC didn't exist.
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:08:51
Deposit insurance.

Wonder if UHS is going to come knocking at his door...

Blacklist her... from what?
@_date: 2014-02-17 04:21:48
It's success stories like these that the media should be focusing on.
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:44:49
Wow, rude.

That is an unbelievable shitload of defensive posting for someone going along with a joke.

*scoffs* Through Bitpay? Wake me when they're setting their prices in BTC. Til then, they won't have MY business.

@_date: 2013-11-26 14:34:30
How very short-sighted of you.
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:30:37
You mean that the exchange rate to USD is too volatile. And if they're just converting their payments straight to USD, then what differences does this announcement make?
@_date: 2013-07-04 04:14:09
House fires are pretty lethal, too...
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:41:22
Then they need to convince their supplier otherwise. Otherwise we're getting nowhere.
@_date: 2013-11-01 21:11:57
Cash vending machines give change because it'd be highly inconvenient to require exact change when dealing in cash. Bitcoin allows you to pay the exact price regardless of what it is. Good luck convincing a judge/jury that you had any reason to put 5 BTC in a vending machine other than committing tax fraud.
And besides all that, from your own link:


@_date: 2013-11-27 00:00:16
"Yes," what? They only need to adjust their Bitcoin prices if they convert the payments to USD. And as long as they and other merchants keep doing this, Bitcoin will remain volatile. These spineless turds need to step up to the plate.

If you really are about your sister, find her a good lawyer so that she can sue your ass for her share :)
