Bitcoin-qt reserves only 100MB for dbcache. That's too small when doing daily synchronization. Start your wallet with -dbcache=3000, and see if there is any improvement. Don't use PC for anything else in that time.

If you are not going to use that node for verifiying your own transactions, then it will be only a donation to the community. Bandwidth depends on the number of connections you allow to your node. But first you need to download 100G of blockchain data, and verify it.

The limit was probably put in to prevent a miner to mine the block so big, that would break other miners in the network. At that time, block reward was only a $1 or two, so some miner/kid could do it just for fun of breaking things, even if he loses the block reward. Today, the block reward is $12,000, mining is a bussiness, miners would not kid with that.
Edit - should also add, that at that time, bitcoin software was in early development, not tested or optimized much. Big block could knock it down. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 12:44:41
Yes, but what will be their total value? My opinion is that it will be greater. But its just my opinion.
@_date: 2017-02-12 16:13:42
Not up to date, and not updated anymore. The speed of the download is not the main factor, but the validation of the blocks. It is very disk I/O bound, having a ssd helps a lot. Also, setting the database cache to some higher value, so that many of disk I/O is cached. Default dbcache is 300MB, depending on your ram, set it higher - 4000 on a 8GB PC.  
@_date: 2017-02-05 00:38:05
Comparing apples and oranges.
Infinite inflation would plummet the price to the ground, and all the invested cost the miners have put into mining would be lost. Why would miners want to do that?
Increasing the block size limit means more users using the network, faster and more predictable confirmation times, and predictable fees. All that would increase the value of the coin.

People were concerned about scaling even back in 2013, because they knew it will be long process.
Block limit made no difference in the beginning, it was set at 1MB when the blocks were 10kb or less.
Average chart is not giving you the right picture, as a way mining works there will always be some number of empty blocks, that distort the picture.

It's a cache! Configurable! Not as your claim that all UTXOs are in memory. You set the cache size, software will use it, for chainstate, and other indexes.


AA says 'all unspet transaction outputs, in memory.' He is Wrong, as dbcache parameter is configurable, 300MB default.

Introduction of assumed-valid blocks
A significant portion of the initial block download time is spent verifying scripts/signatures. Although the verification must pass to ensure the security of the system, no other result from this verification is needed: If the node knew the history of a given block were valid it could skip checking scripts for its ancestors.
A new configuration option 'assumevalid' is provided to express this knowledge to the software. Unlike the 'checkpoints' in the past this setting does not force the use of a particular chain: chains that are consistent with it are processed quicker, but other chains are still accepted if they'd otherwise be chosen as best. Also unlike 'checkpoints' the user can configure which block history is assumed true, this means that even outdated software can sync more quickly if the setting is updated by the user.
Because the validity of a chain history is a simple objective fact it is much easier to review this setting. As a result the software ships with a default value adjusted to match the current chain shortly before release. The use of this default value can be disabled by setting -assumevalid=0

Yes, it does. To be able to route payments for others, user must open many channels and lock his bitcons there. More channels you are able to sustain with your locked bitcoins, more payments will go through, and more fees collected. This will lead to several big interconnected hubs.
Also, there is none efficient decentrakized routing algo, so routing payments is more efficient with big hubs.

That's a lie! Bitmain (antpool) did not mine other blocks than core after the agreement!
@_date: 2016-11-29 15:56:16
You overlooked one more chart - the chart  of 'average times between blocks'.
A fluctuation in the block production time (average time between blocks) has very big impact in creating a backlog when the network is operating close to the limit.
Last week block time went up to 11 minutes for three days.
Even with no increase in tx demand, about 15MB of transactions were left unprocessed each day.
Think about it and you will get it that there was no spam attack.  No growth, also, but just underperformance of the network lasting for three days.
@_date: 2016-11-27 20:25:54
Not much. 
@_date: 2016-12-10 23:17:13
OK, you have an open channel with Walmart, then you want to go at Starbucks. You open a new channel there, too? And the same at any other merchant?
The main, and most important part of Lightning NETWORK is routing payments in that network, so a user is not required to open a new channel every time he sends payment to new contact. 
Read the LN whitepaper to see that.
@_date: 2016-11-29 13:10:07
If you look at the number of blocks mined at the days of backlog, you will find it was way under average. Time between block went up to 11 minutes.
With normal demand, it means that 15MB of tx was left unprocessed each day, for three days - 45MB backlog.
@_date: 2016-12-01 09:21:28

@_date: 2016-11-24 10:06:45
Edit - this below you can try if receiving wallet is yours, of course.
Do a tx with those unconfirmed coins to another address, paying a high fee to cover both transactions - CPFP (child pays for parent). IF your wallet allows you to spend unconfirmed coins.
If not, you can try to SWEEP the coins with some other wallet, like mycelium. Again, paying much more for fee.  Find the private key for that receiving address in Electrum, scan it with 'cold storage' function in Mycelium. 
Or - maybe you can do that directly in Electrum? Electrum has the SWEEP function, I think.

Also, check the block generation times. Right now is 97 blocks/day. It's been under 120 blocks/day since retarget. This underperformance also creates backlog that can not be cleared right away.

For stated limit all transaction must be segwit, not only a portion. On the other part of the statement, I agree, more multisig usage, higher will be the effective limit, so 'it might' get closer to 2MB.

Why there is no LN simulation, simulation of real world usage, so I can see the numbers, network topologies, routes, paths, fees, amounts? Without that, all you said above is some SF. If LN is such a big bet for bitcoin to go forward, I would expect it to be better researched, studied, simulated, and presented to us with data.

Wrong 1.7 is efective limit when ALL transactions are segwit. Teoretical limit is 4MB.




There are some previous blocks with with lots of 1-in 1-out P2WPKH transactions, and you end up with around 1.7MB. There are also some giant transactions which push block size up to near 2MB. Those would be non-standard and not relayed on mainnet; I was testing the new signature hashing which scales much better. (a 12K txin transaction would probably take minutes to verify without segwit)


@_date: 2016-11-23 08:06:12

@_date: 2016-09-14 18:41:22
By setting the dbcache option to about half the RAM in your system, it would complete this in the same time it needs to download the blockchain on your internet connection (20 hours on a 10mbit connection and 8GB RAM). Default value for dbcache is 100MB, it is too low to keep the indexes in the cache and the node must wait for the disk I/O most of the time.

For now, without CVS and segwit active in bitcoin protocol, you need to trust the node you open the channel with. It's a 2-of-2 multisig transaction and a non-cooperative node can keep your coins locked (I think).
