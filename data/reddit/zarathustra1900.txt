My comment is a screenshot of google trends, a google service that tracks interest in search terms on google. This is not a price chart, nor did I give advice about bitcoin as an investment. My comment was purely intended to illustrate the fact that this is not a small bump in interest that similar threads in the past have attempted to show but turned out not to be accurate.

Do you think the value of the bitcoin network can be expressed in another way then it's current monetary value? Also, which fundamental aspects of bitcoin have changed since the last price bubble? Think about these questions and I think that you will come to the conclusion that its not only emotion that keeps people interested in bitcoin. 
Bitcoin cannot be reduced to a single number. Only money fetishists would hold such an ignorant view. The utility of bitcoin does not consist of the ability to gain wealth from it, it lies in its undeniable efficiency of the transfer of value. How this aspect is viewed from outside the bitcoin ecosystem is irrelevant to its utility. Anyone who can place this technology in a historical context would never pose this view. Only when no one or no thing is using this system anynore, then its utility and therefor its value disappears. 
Since I last checked the bitcoin network is still growing, and its growing fast. So I will hold my bitcoin despite this falling price.

I really think you should (at least in the beginning) make bitcoin payments optional so users get to know the service before they have to spend btc and register. 
Also, you could make the first few minutes of the video free (might be difficult to do technically) or what I would personally prefer: let users send some btc (like $1-5) to their account and at the end of the week/month distribute that btc over the content creators (just like flattr). But to do this you need good content first. 
I like your concept, and I know it's still in beta, but it needs some work to draw in new users imo. Good luck! 
edit: when I say distribute it over content creators I mean send it to the creators of the videos you have watched (or liked), not all content creators. Just making sure I was being clear. 
@_date: 2014-12-29 13:17:37

You gave me an idea. What if you could tip small toy figures or other fun objects. The user that wants to tip just leaves a comment like we currently do with changetip, only instead of an amount, you specify an object (like a small 3d printed upvote, or the reddit alien. stuff thats kind of fun to collect or show of, or whatever). To collect the 'tip', people would only have to fill in their address to receive it (postage costs are not a problem since 'tips' are small and light).
Now you say, people don't want to give out their address to this 'tip sending company', since it can link their location to their reddit (or other) account. And I say, that's true. So perhaps not many people will trust it.
But we could find a solution for that, what if we made this tip system fully opensource and transparent. And instead of letting a 'tip company' send the objects, lets decentralize that and let it be handled by whoever is capable of delivering that object (people with 3d printers, or access to lots of small toys/whatever).
The party that will 'sell' the object can 'claim' a certain tip without knowing the username of the person getting tipped and ask for the address directly.The seller can then ship it to the person that gets tipped. When the person that gets tipped receives the item, it can close the deal and the tip amount will be send to the party that claimed and 'sold' the tip.
You are still giving out your address, but not linked to your account and does not get stored on a central database anymore. If anything goes wrong, the tip goes back to the original tipper.
Since the object has little value outside the context of the tip, scams are not very likely (tipping yourself to get the object). Also, the tipper can have a certain reputation that is visible to the 'seller'. The opensource system can generate a certain reputation number based on the post history of a certain user. This can be faked, but it's a lot of hassle for a small novelty item.
I don't know if this will work, It's just a thought I had.
@_date: 2014-12-18 06:43:00
I agree with you that it is misleading. But giving your examples, Bitcoin is still much cheaper since WU takes 5% and 14%. Although I must admit, I don't think sending $7 to MEX will only cost you $0.07 with this service. There are other hidden costs, but WU has those as well (they earn on exchange rates for example).
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:40:53
Also, in case the item is 3d printed. It's possible to create your own 100% custom object as a tip. Talk about an original 'thank you'. You could even pay a 3d modeler in bitcoin to create a custom 3d model for someone. With custom texts under the toy figure like "thanks for your great story - It will be some sort of trophies that people can collect. Just like achievements in games, but then for real :)
Or perhaps all sorts of 3d models could be uploaded by anyone, and in the tip you refer to one of those uploaded models.

I almost feel bad for them.. almost, but not really :)
@_date: 2014-12-24 14:40:49
Too bad most bitcoiners will pay through changetip. It would be awesome to see all those transactions coming in. Also, more transparency.

It's not "business doing well". They need that money to pay their lawyers, insurances, employees, buildings, etc. It's pure overhead that they need to cover. The actual profit is in actuality much lower. Compare that to bitcoin. It's just a protocol where every miner can participate in if they think they can make a profit. There isn't any of that business stuff that PayPal has to cover. 
In other words, bitcoin is a much more efficient way to transfer money. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:17:33
Im really impressed with how smooth this is working, even on mobile. I hope to see this in use at bitcoin conferences. I'm willing to pay to see presentations/speakers live in exchange for some bits.

Thanks. Even though I didn't participate I'll send some bits over. I like these kind of community initiatives.

He associates the security issues of the method/medium of storage of the bitcoins with bitcoin itself, the two are not the same at all. Bitcoin is intrinsically secure, so I do find it misleading and/or misinformed to say bitcoins are insecure in the way he did.

This is what I mean with 'hidden' exchange rates:  That is another ~2%.
Again, the image I posted is misleading and I completely agree with you that companies should stick to the facts. Just pointing out WU isn't as transparent about everything either. Companies just do this kind of shit because it works.
I edited my post to reflect the new info that was brought up.
@_date: 2015-01-28 06:43:05
You'd have to break up because she never gets to suck your dick until her dick sucking skills are at max competence. At least, that's his point. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 14:04:58
I'm not saying anything. I'm was trying to expand the metaphor since it leaves out the core point the minister is trying to make. The actual point he's making that would fit the metaphor is more like you would never let your girlfriend suck your dick because her dick sucking skills increase every day, but if you would let her suck your dick, her skill instantly decreases so when she sucks you the next time it will be less good. The minister's trying to say that no one would let his girlfriend suck dick, since it will be less good the next time and it's always more desirable to wait for "the ultimate suck". This is in my opinion the correct way to describe his point in a dick sucking metaphor.
So no, I'm not saying that at all, but I understand your confusion about what I said since I left out some important parts that had made sense in my head but not in my comment.
And to make it clear, no, I do not agree with the minister for obvious reasons :)
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:09:31
I agree that the lack and manner of communication is concerning. But they did provide info about their solvency in the message on the website, too bad we have to trust them on their word. 
I'm more optimistic about their future than you are, but we'll just have to wait. One thing is for sure, if I had coins/fund stored there I would have gotten them out asap after the way they handled this. If gox didn't happen I would be more lenient about it I think. But it did happen and it's still very fresh in the communities mind. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:54:24
Thank you for making this post and taking the initiative. I've been having these concerns as well for a while. I think the problem lies in the fact that the reddit bitcoin community is increasingly becoming more passive. It's as if people here are just waiting for the price to come back up. This is not the community I joined when I became interested in 2012. I think the bitcoin philosophy is founded on other principles than I have witnessed in this subreddit for the last year. 
I'm not having that 'community feeling' anymore. Anyone else feel this way? 
@_date: 2015-01-10 10:17:52
You have just witnessed the power of open source software on an open protocol. No need to reinvent the wheel, all the building blocks are available for them to use. 
Big banks/exchanges cannot download the "money sending" library v1.35 from github and place it in their stack. No, they have to develop, test and review it all from scratch. This is why you cannot compare it to other financial grade applications/projects, and the reason why bitcoin will become huge. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 18:30:55
And you are completely justified to have that stance. 
Though, I think it's too early to draw conclusions like you kind of did. I think he/Bistamp was under a lot of pressure when the hack happened and with that they felt it was needed to get thing operational asap. The thing is, these things cannot be rushed. I have a background in software development and what they are trying to do in 48 hours seem impossible to me. Especially since security is such an delicate issue you just have to take your time to make sure things are sound. They made a mistake by announcing everything would be up and running in 48h. 
The signing of a message so they could prove they are still in control of the bulk of the funds would be something they should do I think. Why don't they do it? I wouldnt know, but I guess it has to do with lawyers advising them not to since that kind of transperancy could perhaps backfire in some way. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:17:41
If half the miners shut down block times will be twice as long on average, which is not really a huge problem for transactions (technically). The thing is, if half the miners quit, the rest of the miners will only get 50% of their usual income in the same period of time until difficulty adjusts. If this causes even more miners to quit, this could get quite nasty. I'd like to call it the "hashrate spiral of death".
@_date: 2015-01-08 17:14:33

Bitcoin is a trojan horse. Right now we must do some concessions to get in the city. Once we're in we can open the doors and we don't need these kinds of companies anymore. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 06:15:20
Can you link some info about this? The missing shares I mean. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:06:05
You are right, thanks. I didn't consider that.
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:34:54
~~Actually, now that I think about it. I did consider it, but I left out a critical part of my reasoning. If the price stays the same then you are right since miners halve and time doubles, nothing changes (earning wise). But when the hashrate drops because of (or at the same time as) a drop in price then they do (temporarily until difficulty adjust) earn less.~~
~~The reason why I called it a "hashrate spiral of death" is because even more miners may quit after the drop in hashrate for the same reason the first 50% (in this hypothetical scenario) of miners quit in the first place. If then those miners quit, more may follow and so on until no miners are left that can mine our way to diff adjust.~~
~~So, these sudden, large drops in price are actually very dangerous for bitcoin. Maybe not yet since most miners are still profitable at these price and hashrate levels. But I will keep a very close eye on the hashrate until price recovers, especially since we just had a difficulty adjust of +8% and already there are reports of miners turning off their machines.~~ 
edit: nevermind, you are still right ;)

It saddens me a lot of the reasonable pushback comes from buttcoiners while bitcoiners voted the topics up in the first place. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 11:18:11
I don't really have evidence, just observations I made over the last couple of months. There have been some threads that try to associate the price decline with all sorts of "conspiracy-esque" theories involving governments and/or companies. These threads have had quite some upvotes and of course buttcoiners dive on those threads like a lion on red meat and just laugh at and ridicule us.
I may have exaggerated a bit when I said "a lot of the reasonable pushback comes from buttcoiners" since they are obviously not that reasonable over the whole. But there are some of them who do have well reasoned critiques about why bitcoin wouldn't work out (not that I agree with them, but I appreciate their thoughts since they make me think from another perspective). I'll admit, those buttcoiners are rare, but they exist.
@_date: 2015-01-06 14:30:34
Until now.
@_date: 2015-08-02 20:09:43
If you really think this then you have no idea what Bitcoin really is. Because this will surely destroy Bitcoin or make it so tame that no-one would care about it. 
The fact that you and the people up voting you do not seem to grasp the fundamental principle of why Bitcoin works makes me worried.

Actually, I'm suprised how well bitcoind is holding up with these stresstests.  This is my "server" for the past week:  Note there is no bump in cpu load at all since the spam started (most of the load is from running a tor relay, bitcoind uses about ~5%). And this server is equiped with a dirt cheap and old [i3 530]( from 2010!

Be careful with grouping together those who "oppose" the blocksize limit increase and employees of Blockstream. I don't think you mean to say this, but sometimes I get the feeling some people around here think that's the case.


What exactly is your issue with the method they propose to use to fix this problem? What questions do you need answered? I hear a lot op people say that they don't trust Blockstream because there are investors that want a return on their investment. Ok I understand, it looks like a conflict of interest. But what are the exact issues with their reasoning regarding the blocksize? I think you must be concrete, because they are used as an easy target right now because of this.
Don't get me wrong, I understand (I think) both sides of this debate and it's a very hard problem. But you/we need more then the "they are backed by VC, we can't trust them" routine I have been hearing since the start of this whole debate.

He used Red Hat as an example, you can look it up.
@_date: 2015-07-25 14:56:10
Well, it was not my example but I can see why he brought it up. 
A lot of the [Blockstream guys]( have a linux backround and [this statement]( is also very compatible with the linux/open source ethos. 
Also, I have been following the bitcoin-dev mailing list and irc channels closely over the years and nothing has led me to believe they want anything other then to make a success out of bitcoin.
Here is a snippet from the Red Hat wiki page:




Red Hat has contributed massively to the success of linux and I believe Blockstream has similar goals when it comes to bitcoin. There is a reason these guys have been interested in, and have contributed to bitcoin from the beginning, and it's not because they want to make a quick buck (imho).
So no, I don't have proof or insider info, but it just makes sense to me that this is their plan/goal.
@_date: 2015-07-19 21:23:39
Ever had issues with customers and price volatility? For example, they buy $100 worth of bitcoin and want to spend it the next day but by then its worth less then you are asking? 
@_date: 2015-07-25 18:52:23
You look at the investment as if it is totally isolated, which isn't the case I think. The VC's behind the deal have a great amount of money staked in other bitcoin companies. Those other companies obviously rely on a healthy bitcoin network. It is only natural that there will be companies that contribute to the development in this area.
This does not mean they (Blockstream) don't intend to make money, but there are many ways to earn money in bitcoin development without hijacking the network (look at Red Hat and linux for example) like some people here think (not necessarily you).
I'm not saying we should not care about Blockstream's intentions anymore, but I think there is too much skepticism of it at the moment.
