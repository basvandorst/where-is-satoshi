If the app goes on the Google Play Store, you can't do in-app-purchases with Coinbase. It's against TOS. Purchases have to go through the Play Store. Developers in the past added PayPal. Their apps were removed. Just an FYI.

I'm older than you and prefer Dogecoin. Your argument is invalid.

I can't upvote you more. I'm new to crypto. Every time I looked into Bitcoin I didn't like what I saw. It just wasn't for me. was very inviting and welcoming. The friendly nature made me get into crypto. I've even been trading up from Dodge to BTC, very little, but still.

Android Key Lime Pie. Need I say more?

I stand semi corrected. I guess it depends on the use case for the IAP.
Developers offering additional content, services or functionality within another category of app downloaded from Google Play must use Google Play's in-app billing service as the method of payment, except:
where payment is primarily for physical goods or services (e.g., buying movie tickets, or buying a publication where the price also includes a hard copy subscription); or
where payment is for digital content or goods that may be consumed outside of the app itself (e.g., buying songs that can be played on other music players).

Well I hope so. Dogecoin is 1 month old. How old is BTC again? Why such hostility?

TLDR; moon +20 doge
Seriously though, due to the meme and funny nature of Doge, it comes off as friendly and inviting. Tons of new users are getting into cryptocurrency with Doge that would have never done sone with BTC or LTC. They don't feel intimidated.
