You'll be fine, as long as you understand the risks involved in buying bitcoins and having to wait 4-5 Business days for the transaction to go through. This is also assuming you are lucky enough to buy bitcoins before they have reached there 24 hour limit.

What operating system do you run when logging into mtgox? 
  If windows, do you update java religiously and scan for viruses on a regular basis? Even if you were running Linux and on a network with other users its possible that someone could have MITM'ed your password.
I am not a big fan of mtgox but I feel they are relatively secure. I mean if your coins were compromised from a server side attack, I imagine many other users would be in the same dilemma you are.

Considering how many people subscribed to this subreddit within the past few months I'm assuming a lot of people jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon after the price was greater then $100.
  
  Shucks I'm guessing a lot of people bought in at over $200 expecting to get rich over night. With that being said, I'm assuming the people you are referring to are the people who saw bitcoins as an investment, rather then a revolution and are bitter that they haven't gained any revenue on there investment.
 As one who owns a nice chunk of bitcoins it fucking sucks to loose more in one day then I earn on a monthly basis, but Viva la revolucion! I ain't worried bout shit.
I'm here for the revolution not the profits.

I woke up Saturday morning and saw btc were at $28 and i ran like a mad man to convert all my freely available usd into btc because I'm convinced that buying under $30 will probably not be happening again anytime soon, hopefully ever. 
@_date: 2013-03-20 21:20:17

@_date: 2013-03-29 00:30:30

OMG! I never even thought about this, they could put a stop to this p2p protocol just like those torrent things that came to a screeching halt so abruptly.
  BRB cashing out.
@_date: 2013-06-06 13:24:12
God dammit why cant they just give the check to coinbase and refund everyone in BTC
@_date: 2013-06-15 16:24:09
That's probably because this post was about giving advice to those considering investing in bitcoins, not actual investment strategies themselves.
  You also have a quite a biased opinion why only consider dollar cost averaging and not lump sum investments.
  "Lump-sum investing outperforms dollar-cost averaging two-thirds of the time, according to Vanguard, even when results are adjusted for the higher volatility of a stock/bond portfolio versus cash investments." 
Not trying to start a flame war just saying....
