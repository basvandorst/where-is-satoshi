Many years ago, during the birth of America, Thomas Jefferson coined the phrase, “separation of church and state”. In looking back, we all know the value of that simple statement. 
Do you think decades from now, people could look back at this bitcoin era and describe it as the beginning of “separation of coin and state”?

Sundays and Mondays are not usually rising bitcoin price days.

Not sure why you would say that, but keep clinging to that thought, and if it gives you comfort, enjoy it!

This is the funny thing about bitcoin. Because it isn't correlated with other financial markets (stocks, bonds, etc), by owning it, you actually reduce the risk in your portfolio. Just the opposite of what people think.

I noticed the same thing. I'm changing my DCA strategy to buy mid-month.
@_date: 2018-09-14 20:56:57
It always tends towards equilibrium in the long term. Today, mining is at breakeven for many miners. You keep mining to keep the lights on. But at $7,500 you've generated a little profit, and maybe enough to encourage new miners to enter the space. More miners means the difficulty goes up, and profits go down. Even when it dips below breakeven, miners will continue mining because they anticipate the price will go up, and will only stop mining when finances dry up. Regardless, it tends towards equilibrium in the long term.

Today, bitcoin is the leading candidate for the future. The next closest thing, and the coin that many thought would overtake it is ether, and you see what's happening to it. One of the success factors for bitcoins long term promise is the army of amazing developers working on it. While it's possible that one day a coin may overtake it, it would take the introduction of new tech that is orders of magnitude beyond what bitcoin offers. No such thing exists today. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 16:04:38

2. Governments don't want to control money. They want to influence money supply and they do that with fiscal policy. Banking systems influence money supply through monetary policy. The hope is that by working together these two entities can influence money supply in a way that results in a stable currency. Some countries/governments do this better than others.

Football season has begun in earnest in America. As fans around the country experience jubilation as their favorite teams climb in the rankings, gleeful Americans will begin buying bitcoins in earnest, causing the price to skyrocket. It’s only at the end of the year, upon seeing their team collapse, with no championship prospect, that disillusionment kicks-in mid-December / early January causing fans to sell their bitcoins in despair, leading to a price decrease once again.

It's had plenty of unbelievable run-ups before, but in today's market, it's a fair question. It's possible the run up to 20k was a one-time thing. There are plenty of new factors that didn't exist before: futures-trading, altcoins, etc. 
But when people ask me what I think,  I say it's likely we'll see 30K, very possible we'll see 50K, and slightly possible we'll see 100K. 
Oh, and did I mention I believe in the tech?

@_date: 2018-08-16 15:45:34
I expect market anticipation will bump the price up in advance of the halving, followed by miners selling twice as many coins to cover their operating costs, leading to wild short-term crashes and rallies. And yeah, months later...moon. ;-)
@_date: 2018-08-03 14:17:55
Modern portfolio and risk management teaches us that it’s good to diversify, and it’s particularly good to diversify across non-correlated assets. Because cryptocurrencies have little correlation with traditional financial assets, you actually reduce your long-term risk, by adding cryptocurrencies to your portfolio. Non-intuitive, I know, but it is a reason to buy.
@_date: 2018-08-20 17:36:27
It is a good time to buy, but don't concern yourself with buying it all at once. A better strategy is to Dollar Cost Average (DCA) by buying a little bit every month. That way you don't worry about trying to "time" the market, but rather, you'll catch the lows and the highs.

That's a good point. But here's something: one of the remarkable tenets of computing tech is that transistors double every two years. You may know that. It's named Moore's Law. But what's even more remarkable, and lessor known, is that storage capacity doubles every 18 months. It's not uncommon now to find smartphones with 128GB. This trend is going to continue into the foreseeable future, and that's why the blockchain size is not a big problem today, nor will it be for quite some time. Good question though.
@_date: 2018-10-11 11:17:49
One stock market correction and suddenly bitcoin is correlated with stocks? Sorry, no. Look at BTC price June 7-9, July 7-9, August 5-7, Sept 3-7, and now Oct 8-10. It drops at this point every month. It's the normal monthly BTC price cycle.

The concept of it being strictly scarce is an ideal, and often touted by industry pundits; however, there are forces at work that water down that ideal through (for example) hard forks, effectively doubling the supply and effectively marketing/selling large numbers of people to embrace new coins.

I wish that were always true, but it isn't. Case in point: arguably the Betamax technology was superior to VHS, but the commonly-held belief is that VHS won-out due to slick marketing. That's just one example of many where better tech doesn't always win.

Buy monthly, regularly. But if you want a slight edge, consider buying in the middle of the month (it's not always, but it's often dipping in the middle of the month) AND consider buying on Sundays and Mondays. Those are (not always, but often) the cheapest days to buy.

I disagree a little bit. I believe bitcoin's low-side price is highly-correlated to the average cost to mine. So the price will tend to hover at this price until some major positive news breaks causing fomo to kick-in again.

You don't need any coding knowledge. And the networking knowledge you need is minimal too. See if you can find a local crypto meetup and ask around for a miner who's willing to sell you a used S9 (or other). If he's willing to sell you one, then he'd probably be willing to help you set it up too. As others have said, they are loud, and they put out a lot of heat too. Since you're doing it to learn, you're gonna have a great time. Just don't expect to make much $$$.

Coinbase makes it super easy to buy. You're basically just placing a market order.

It's nice to believe it's being manipulated, but it's not. Mostly you have a bunch of miners selling coin to make a slight profit, a few traders who think they can beat the system (but many don't), and lastly many, many believers who, through dollar-cost-averaging, invest a wee-bit of their paycheck every month, at the end of the month; thus the run-ups at the end of the month, and the drops early in the following month, followed by a plateau until the cycle repeats.
@_date: 2018-11-10 01:53:45
Bitcoin has a weekly, monthly, and annual cycle. Look back over the last many months. There's a run up that begins near the end of one month and tends to continue into the following month followed by a drop off between the 3rd and 10th. There's your pattern. It's natural to think there's a relationship with equities, but it just coincidence.
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:15:31
You've sold me on reading the book, and I will keep an open mind. Thanks for the recommendation. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 13:01:27
They both perform important functions of the network. It's an over-simplification, but you might say masternodes verify the blockchain and transactions while miners expend compute power hashing (incrementing through billions of nonces to find the hash that qualifies as the next block), to give them the right to package up the next block of transactions. 
In the world of bitcoin only the miner is rewarded with a payout of bitcoin, while the masternoder is  rewarded with only the satisfaction of helping the bitcoin network. Other cryptocurrencies, like Dash for example, reward the miners and the masternoders because they recognize the contribution of both.

@_date: 2019-01-29 19:02:52
Yes, I believe this true. It should settle somewhere just above the *average* cost to mine a single bitcoin. Today that average cost is between $3500 - $4000. And as others have said, the difficulty adjustments impact that average cost.
@_date: 2018-11-06 15:00:17
I agree with all of your points except 3. I'm no economics expert, but I worry that deflationary money is harmful to capitalistic societies. I also believe that banks are important and useful organizations, so bashing them isn't going to win any points either.

Good to see a new generation of miners out of Bitmain. Conceivably this will be their top-of-the-line machine for the next two years. If the specs are to be believed they're not as dramatic an improvement as past generations. With millions of S9s out there, it'll be awhile before the new ones impact difficulty. Lastly, I don't believe they'll have any impact on bitcoin price, but they should have an impact on Bitmain's stock price down the road. Just my two cents.

Buy now, and don't get hung up on timing. But moving forward, and more importantly, DCA. Set aside a little bit of money every month, and buy. In the long-term, you'll acquire more of the asset on the dips. This way you don't have to worry about trying to determine when to get in or out of the market.
