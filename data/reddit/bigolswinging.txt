Gemini credits your account $500 per day. So in two you could get your 1000 worth of btc.

You should be buying now at  tomorrow at 13,500, or three days from now at 15,000K.  What i am trying to say is any price lower than the all time high is a great time to get in!

Wait!!!  Yes btc is cheap right now but the price and moral are very weak at this point.  Eveyone is scared so keep your money until stability....

You'll be fine you bought at a great price. I myself bought in today at 14,800 and 15,300.  BTC price fluctuates up or down 10% to 20% in any given week.

Ultimately it's a risk...  It's your choice but I personally see btc growing this week at least past 19,000....  A lot of money is running through crypto currencies in general everything will be growing...  Easily this week it will grow 15% with minor corrections.

I would not use coinbase to buy anything (hefty fees) but I would use  GDAX (coinbase exchange).  Also I personally use gemini and can't complain.

I think what coinbase is trying to do besides screw with btc... Is that they are trying to take market in masses and then after having millions of accounts they will sell out to a bank.

Coinmarketcap.com Korean exchange has bitcoin priced at 21K. And don't think about creating an account to transfer and sell....

Use GDAX... Coinbase is used to make quick buys on your cellphone which is why they charge hefty fees for the convenience...

Supply and Demand.  People using CoinBase have access to GDAX. Because of LTC crazy growth people tend to buy in and increase demand which increases the price on this exchange.  A lot of new users buying in on ltc.

Gemini ♊ .  I would have used GDAX but my account is blocked since June 2017 and support seems to be doing everything else but work on my support ticket that I submitted.

I use gemini. Transaction fees .25%.  Deposits are credited to your account instantly (Max deposit limit 500 per day) I have no complaints it's the best exchange.

Use gemini excahnge ♊. Deposits are credited instantly. This exact same issue happend to me in June when bitcoin was 2000 my money did not arrive until weeks later and  bitcoin was well past that.  I'll never forget...

Before you hold or sell put in a good amount of research on bitcoin.  And make a decision depending on what you belive the future of bitcoin is.  I personally will hold and keep buying at this low price.

How are you liking the 1% fee from gemini?
