The latter is what I'm guessing too. A buddy of mine who used to sell on local bitcoin told me about the time he messed up and sent 5btc to another address he previously traded with that day. Expensive lesson to learn, but it is something that happens

What if I do have my old computer and the wallet on it. If I can't remember my password is there anyway to access my private keys from electrum?
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:30:03
Hi would you be willing to help me set up my own instance of this for my own btc wallet? The wallet is running of electrum from 2015. I know a few of the combos it could be but like him I made this wallet one night before really trying out btc and accidentally sent 2btc to it. 
I cant for the life of me get the password right but if I could get a cracker working on it then maybe just maybe it can get it right. That money would honestly change my life right now.

I already tried with walletrecoveryservices :'( 
RIP me. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:47:36
Ya it does not look like it will let me export the private keys without the password. Truly tragic, the amount of btc would be life changing to me at this moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:18:10
Sorry I meant if I can't remember my password. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:27:02
I do have the wallet.dat file and it was created in august of 2015 on electrum. It is encrypted with a password which I cannot remember. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:39:14
Hey no issues my friend. Just the fact that you helped how you did really means alot to me. I'm not the op btw just some guy who could really use the 2.2 btc he has locked away.
@_date: 2018-08-19 16:04:50
Hey that heroin probably really helped your life!

Idk once we hit ATH then ill be bored ;)
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:20:39
Just noticed that too. Holy jeez today has been a roller coaster. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 13:42:45
Here we go again 
@_date: 2017-01-08 13:40:28
I completely agree with this. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:21:08
I know. What a missed opportunity. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:09:47
What is the point of this though. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 04:14:07
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:11:26
Like others have said this was a phishing link. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 07:50:43
I love mycelium 
@_date: 2016-12-24 04:33:02
Ya after some sleep just checked txids on blockexplorer and both have come up as not found seems like an issue with the wallet app on my phone.
 Luckily neither of them were very large
@_date: 2016-12-25 04:17:22
You could write your seed down and put it in a safety deposit box in a bank. 
Or a safe in your house. 
Or engrave it into the backside of a ring
Or carve it into your car glove box. 
Etch it into the bottom of a stepping stone outside in your yard. 
So many better options. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 23:26:49
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:09:05
Same. This was very well described and eye opening. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:31:03
Think if you just did that with btc instead :( 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:40:38
Didnt read. No paragraphs
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:48:50
I suppose. However btc was a revolutionary thing. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:50:48
Define at what point it became gambling though... It would take a lot for some people to completely lose their pants. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:50:04
Dont ever put blockfolio on your phone then...
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:48:45
you bad
and you should feel bad
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:19:21
people said the same about 10, 30, 50, 100, 1000 etc. hell once it hit 1k again and pushed 2k i was sure 1k would be the new bottom for 6 months
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:18:50
That is the goal. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:44:25
Eh you say that now but during the spam attack on the network fees increased to astronomical levels. 
@_date: 2016-10-15 22:30:41
If your city has btc atm then you can. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:38:06
True. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 12:16:37
While I understand your reluctance to talk. I will be uninstalling mycelium and not using the service again. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 04:16:22
332 on finex
@_date: 2015-02-20 11:24:01
494 a good price for one? Maybe a year and a half ago? 
@_date: 2016-07-07 17:21:48
Jesus more red tape. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 12:32:20
Not when he fucking crashes the entire market with his shit. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 08:50:40
Well depends on circumstances. Do you know the phrase or group of words you've just forgot the order or spelling, placement of numbers, 
Or do you know the number sequence you use and forgot the letter part. We'll if it is a word then it will take longer but eventually be found. 
If it is over 10 digits and you don't have small variations you can try then it is basically impossible. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 03:30:37
Nope your best bet is hash cracking software.
