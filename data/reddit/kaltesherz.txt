Absolutely. And because it was a living GIS product you could ask it questions like what has the outcome been for villages we spent x time and y money in, are there correlations between this and that, etc.
GIS is amazing. I'm doing my senior thesis in physics on using GIS in physical modeling applications. Good stuff.

NKE are like going door to door and asking people how they are. Any engagement that we have with the locals that isn't violent would be wrapped up in a NKE intel summary. I used some fancy stats techniques to map out areas that saw more positive or negative engagements over time.

I used to do intelligence for the special forces in Iraq and I remember coming up with a clever Gee-Whiz idea on how to interpret non kinetic engagement reports using GIS and I initially dismissed it as something I'm sure someone in some fancy government lab had already figured out when it hit me that I was that guy, lol. 
I guess what I'm trying to say in a really roundabout way is that if you're asking the right questions, it isn't hard to be the smartest person in the room.

I think he's saying he is at the mercy of the cashier with a pin pad. I had a gas station charge me $80 for an $8 transaction and flat out refuse to check the books. At the time I was young and didn't have the wherewithal to escalate the situation, but that's an example. 
I used to work for a high end retailer and even they made mistakes at the register. What if we switched this whole thing around, the merchant tells the customer how much the services are, and then the customer sends that amount *explicitly*.
I think this is in both parties favor, the merchant enjoys no charge backs and the customer can't be over charged.
Errors still happen but as has been said, it behooves the company to carry a solid policy. 
It does still feel like the wild west sending bitcoin to merchants though. A bitcoin credit rating agency that could prove to be reliable would have a market. 
Escrow works but it would have to be a really public company, those have disappeared the same as some of the stores they were hedging against. 
A new type of transaction insurance could be developed on the private side.

I was trying to be delicate. The problems in various areas of the world are varied and diverse, but at the core is the economy and the way a nation is able to exchange goods that determines if people eat or don't eat.
If the people of the nation refuse to participate in the politics of their nations government (or be at the whims of the US government), there can still be trade between one another even as the local fiat crashes.

We've got lots of folks who have both mined and purchased bitcoin with no way whatsoever to differentiate the two, as far as I can tell, especially as they've been tumbled through wallets and sitting idle for years. What a mess that would be to figure out.

Everything has to start somewhere. You can get just about any good for bitcoin between gyft and car dealers and real estate.
If you had the bitcoins to put down on a new car, cash, I bet almost any car dealer could be convinced at this point to take it.
Same with real estate. 
But if you are concerned that you can't get your mortgage valuated in a currency that last year was thought of on the same level as world of warcraft gold, I don't know how to assuage your concerns.
Maybe this is too visionary of a concept for you.

I more or less agree with him. My girlfriend isn't interested in bitcoin not because I keep her down, I talk her ear off about it.  She holds just enough enthusiasm to be supportive. She just isn't interested, as geeky as she otherwise is.

This. 
If I had had the capital to invest, I'd be wealthy right now. I could have made bank in 2008, again when BoAs stocks crashed in half, Google, I called all this shit. Most of it is pretty obvious if you pay attention. 
Wait for some bad news to drop about some executive affair or some bs that will cause investors to panic sell because their stock was sort of in the news in a negative light. 
You're smart enough to know that the value of the company hasn't changed though and so you snatch up those cheap shares like a boss.

Down voting because you said they are worthless, they are not. Even today btc is superior to visa/mastercard in terms of fees. Not to mention the blockchain is never  "experiencing technical difficulties"  and only able to accept cash.
That said, Id say that, today, it doesn't make sense for your neighborhood supermarket to hold bitcoins as much as they aught to hold on to euros or stock in twitter. Social revolution or not.
A transatlantic trading company, however,  is a different story.
For anybody wanting to send value across distances at little to no cost, there is just nothing like bitcoin (or more generally, cryptocoins in general).
Because bitcoin is decentralized, it will take ambitious early adopters to improve infrastructure. We will need some VCs and angels with deep pockets willing to go out on a limb.

Think about what this looks like to a teacher. You look like you could be writing about a get rich quick scheme and not the future of global trade.
You're obviously a smart kid, youll come to sort out that in order to maximize your success in subjects that you are more knowledgeable in than your superior (teacher, boss, parent, whatever) you have to figure out the best way to present information. 
You maybe haven't seen enough spam or nigerian scams to see why a teacher might be wary. Take this opportunity to educate her, not be obstinate or go on some crusade. There are too many real injustices in the world.

With a merchant account they get fiat locked in right away. My point is they want your money and if you have 20k for them at time of sale,  that's 20k in their account no matter how you look at it.
We are early in the adoption period. There is no way on earth we could have reached where we are today if we didn't have such a price surge. You don't have something like this trickle into existence. If it is going to work, this is what tech stocks always look like before there big IPO.
Merchants aren't wise to hold bitcoins but they are smart to accept them. Its an easy process for them that costs a fraction of getting started in accepting credit cards. 
But right now no you can't go to a grocer and buy a tomato unless they are an early adopter. But seriously, what do you expect this early on? Furthermore there are already work arounds for this through gyft and others.
Im long on bitcoin at this point because its a fundamentally good product with key benefits on its side. You just can't beat it as a way of transferring value. People are already catching on and it is only a matter of time before we get more Angels and VCs behind adoption in the US.

I just have to wonder what you consider adult. Just about everything you learn in school and why has a reason behind it, one of the ways teachers do lack is in how they don't reveal enough behind the scenes.
Believe it or not, you need to know how to solve word problems, and learning a foreign language is important. It doesn't take a whole lot of critical thinking to sort out the whys if we can at least start with the presumption that they aren't *trying* to destroy your life and make you feel stupid.
Chill out a little bit, try and see things from their point of view. It may take you until your late 20s or 30s (and for some people they never get it) if you never are put into a position where you have to teach people or be responsible for their success.

It doesn't have a name yet. We are going through the steps to put the project together at light speed. We recognized the potential for an application that functions like a reverse merchant account a few weeks ago. We are working on locating motivated programmers to do the core of the work.
We are a small team of mathematics and physics students based out of the University of Maine.
We hope that this software will help to free up the market and aid in the functionality of the bitcoin as a currency.
Our ability to generate start up capital will ultimately decide how successful our venture will be. 
As of now, you don't want to spend your bitcoins because it is such a pain to get them back.  Especially in the US. 
We believe that we have a solution which will create a transparent transaction experience, allowing you to maintain your position in bitcoins by converting fiat to bitcoin at the time of sale.
It could similarly be used to make a bitcoin purchase without having a permanent position in bitcoin, where it would act as an intermediary payment service.

Wider adoption of a system like would seem to require times like these in order to generate new interest.
In my opinion the price is held back because of all of the barriers to entry. If I want to buy a bitcoin right this minute I more or less have to buy one on eBay, or otherwise from another person directly.
Demand like this drives innovation and that benefits the valuation of the organization as a whole. 
The concepts haven't changed but this isn't a Facebook IPO, most people still don't even know bitcoin is. 
My stepfather, who is a truck driver, got super excited about bitcoin when I told him about it. He doesn't understand the details but he loves the idea of it being  decentralized. They've been waiting for most of a week now to buy in. So have many many others. Just you wait.
