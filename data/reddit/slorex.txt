I saw this tweet from 




Can someone explain this? Is he saying that using Segwit addresses in my Ledger Nano is dumb and harms the network?

If both chains continue adding blocks at the same rate BCash will halve it's block reward more than a week before Bitcoin. That could be an existential threat to BCash. Maybe Bitmain and Roger have switched their hashpower to Bitcoin to make it catch up with BCash?

Good thread. Thanks for the link.

Re Iota. It is intended as the blockchain of all things IOT. I don't see how the price of a fixed supple token that is the fuel of a massive network can go up so high without damaging the utility of said network.
@_date: 2018-05-15 09:24:24
Since the Bitcoin cash fork happened, there is no debate. Neither chain is full. When they each get near to being full we can draw some conclusions.

Don't look for a direction. Watch carefully what is happening and make your decisions. Don't identify or invent meanings. It is what it is.
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:20:18
I hope something like that happens than Core or BU win. Out of those 2 I prefer Segwit than blocksize. To get to Visa scale transactions we need to have 1 GB blocks. Increasing block size wouldn't turn bitcoin into a global currency for the unbanked.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:41:32
BU is not promising bigger blocks. It's promising block size controlled by miners. That means block sizes that maximize fees. The block size will always be slightly too small.
@_date: 2017-03-25 11:39:21
Depends on the price you bought at. And your nerve. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:37:32
If both sides are unhappy it's a good compromise.
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:58:11
I meant by increasing the blocksize only.

"A full node is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks. Almost all full nodes also help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other full nodes, validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to further full nodes"

It's a bit tongue in cheek. The point is valid however. The Pi is fine as a node btw. Just don't use it with usb stick. Use it with the WD cable and a hard disk.

Yes it does validate. Nodes validate the blocks produced by miners.

Bitcoin is trustless. Consensus means everyone running software that validates to the same rules. Value is what you are prepared to pay. If you are looking for some show of authority to bolster the value of your coin you might be better off selling.

The value is simply that it is scarce, fungible and impervious to counterfeiting and double spending. Once you grasp that it is digital cash you grasp that it can be used to transact and that is it's value. What is the intrinsic value of a five dollar bill?

Go to the youtube channel of the originally posted video and look at their playlist called Banking 101. 
The fact that banks create money to loan or speculate with is widely understood nowadays. It's the reason why so many of us are into Bitcoin.

If all these miners, wallets and other companies really are running 2X software (not just signalling) AND it really doesn't matter that approx 120,000 nodes are running code that will reject 2X blocks, then yes, they have consensus.

Bitcoin is highly deflationary. That's why goods can't be priced in BTC. If I want to buy something with BTC I don't use my BTC holdings. I buy BTC to spend. 
It's not the fault of the miners or developers. Bitcoin is the net effect of all the users.
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:01:23
The code is frozen in preparation for launching by miners and nodes:
In fact, if miners and wallets are happy with it they should be running it already. The change happens on a specific block height, not when the code is installed and started.

BU will allow miners to *set* the block size. Not just increase it. If that happens it will always be small enough to maximize fees - transactions times and fee levels will be secondary.

So they're running their mining pool on top of code that hasn't been released yet? Or are the signalling that they will run it when it's released?
If the latter, it's a low cost way to support the price. They can still choose not to run Segwit2x when it is actually released.
