To me this is the most important feature. Im not sure why ANY wallet wont let you connect to your own node. This should be the default settings for all.

Words like "wishes" and "allow" have no business in bitcoin. No one has the power to change layer 1. This is a feature not a bug.

If you are running a spv wallet, you should be connecting to a trusted node...if you don't connect to a trusted node you're not using bitcoin.

I'm not in that area very often. I'm definitely gonna stop by next week though.

I want to find the owner because I'm curious what the business model is. Get that dick out of your ass. 
@_date: 2016-05-01 19:16:53
Yes, thanks for the advice.

Sorry, but that's not the definition. Rules without rulers. Learn the NAP. Learn voluntarysm

Give me a break, I was on my phone driving. I speak 3 languages. English is not my native language.

You can run a full node with limited bandwidth and limited HD space by pruning the node and by setting up blocksonly.

Wow. Look what I started

You would think that would be the case but in 2014 bear market, the diff just kept rising while price was falling. I remember i had no easy way of buying bitcoin back then so i was trying to mine as many coins as i can (Even at a loss)

Since when is bip91 a hardfork?

The reason im in bitcoin is to gain purchasing power. I dont care the median I use for the exchange.  Sorry, I'm not in this for the tech. 
@_date: 2016-05-01 16:02:58
Well, I can tell you that it's located in NJ. Definitely not the climate for mining all year round. Electricity is pretty *outrageous  here as well.

Why? It should take approximately 3 days to lock in, no?
