It's perfectly legal for registered "insiders" who work for the company to trade stock. The key here is they have to disclose all transactions, by law. When they open a brokerage account they have to declare this, and they also have to submit paperwork on their transaction. All investors can see these transactions, so it is considered fair. This is important because most insiders own stock as a performance incentive, or as a form of non-cash compensation. 
This isn't to be confused with illegal "insider trading" where outsiders have access to the same information (which they should not have access to) but are NOT required to report their transactions.

The ETF doesn't need to "save" bitcoin. It will likely result in a large increase in price because it opens bitcoin up to a larger investment community. You think the ETF is an exit strategy? Don't think you know how this works. Their incentive is the cash flow from running the ETF.

You're asking the wrong question. More coins will be generated for at least the next 100 years. That's inflationary. And quite frankly if bitcoin lasts 100 years, it will probably be more stable, and used as a store of wealth rather than a means of transaction, where a deflationary property is advantageous.
So there isn't a deflationary risk, actually, that anybody living today cares about. 
There is no spoon.
What you are asking is why people are spending them when the price "could go up"? The answer is very simple: **because the price could also go down**. A lot of people are spending because they think the stuff they are getting is worth more than the future investment potential of the coins. And that's their choice. 
Edit: made it more concise.

1. It's called "legal tender", and bitcoin doesn't qualify. Legal tender is something that **must** be an accepted option to settle payment. Generally only government-issued money is designated legal tender. For example, while the USD is accepted by some merchants in Canada, it's **not** legal tender. That doesn't make it illegal, it just means some merchants are within their rights to say "we don't accept that". 
2. There's no such thing as an "illegal currency". Currency can be anything used as a means of exchange. There's no legal *requirement* to accept it if it isn't legal tender (ie bitcoin). 
So, there's nobody saying "you can't use that", only those saying "I don't want to accept that because it's not legal tender (bitcoin)", which is within their rights unless it's declared legal tender. 
Bitcoin will **never** be "legal tender" and that's fine. That doesn't make it illegal. It just means nobody is *forced* to accept it.

Why pose a hypothetical question when you have reality right in front of you. 
You can buy from an exchange at these prices because people are in fact selling their coins. Many are selling their coins beside they expect prices to drop. Hoarding isn't take place at these prices, and you can be sure to see even less of it if prices take off.

Actually an ETF will hold bitcoins, and it will buy and sell them from other markets to meet demand and keep the price in line through arbitrage. I'd be more worried about a closed-end fund, especially with such a volatile market.
Bottom line is this will support the price. And, if they don't do it, someone else will.

Yes they are required in the US to comply with money transmission laws. 
In the US if you are selling bitcoins you must be maintaining records on all of your customers.
In Canada I so not believe that records are required (I believe), but most credible exchanges require customer identification anyways to err on the side of caution. This is why those features are not enabled in Vancouver. They would need to be in the US.

Let me put it this way: you don't need a PhD in math to advance your career. You do a PhD in math because you love math, and you want to do a PhD. This is true of most of most doctoral programs, actually. Ask someone who has completed their PhD and odds are they will agree.
Generally speaking, you'll do programming in a domain where a CS graduate wouldn't have the mathematical background if you're lucky (ie cryptography). Of course, those jobs aren't common. A lot of math PhDs teach high school.

then I fully support you and respect the work that would go into that. I have NO problem with arbitrage. If you meant that when I said HFT and algo trading, then we were just arguing semantics. What you are doing is executing an order on public information, without "predicting" anything, and you're just taking advantage of the opportunity, and it benefits everybody. Awesome.
Conventional HFT and algo trading is based on either 1. information nobody else has (which IS a joke), or 2. "I can predict what the market is GOING TO DO based on some technicals" (which is ALSO a joke).

It was used for quantitative easing. Basically they replaced all the bad loans that were never going to be repaid (subprime mortgages for more than the homes were worth and their associated derivatives) with cash. The FED holds those loans. Had this not happened, most banks would have collapsed, along with many people's savings. We would have experienced massive deflation. Basically they replaced all these bad bets with cash to "pretend this never happened".
It's true that $16 trillion is an absolutely absurd amount of money. A lot of good could have been done with it, say, to fund research for most diseases. Instead we bail out the banks. But nobody complains became they didn't have to actively take it from taxpayers or ask for a cheque. It amounts to tens of thousands of dollars per household.

Frankly, I suspect most bitcoins are being purchased by single men. Wives wouldn't support investing money in this, and I can assure you, they'd see the money leaving your account. There's nothing to hide. 
Therefore, if you're single or bought your bitcoins before marriage, **they yours**. 
So, if by "hide assets", they mean "not get assets from before the marriage" you better fucking believe it.

I honestly feel sorry for the guy, satoshi or not, but I have a feeling that this is going to backfire. I wonder if this is his doing or if others are pushing him to it. Seems to me that the people around him aren't doing him a great service.. so many quotes about "oh yea for sure he's probably satoshi you bet..." I mean you have to admit from the story it sounded like the people around him were giving the reporter everything she wanted to hear.
At this point I think he'd make way more money doing a few exclusives and making it publicly clear that he isn't satoshi and why than seeking damages. I'm not so sure that there's anything specifically damaging in the story.. and if you talk to the media they're free to quote you, even if it's.. weird.

I watched a lecture, in which Zuckerberg basically said that many of the great tech companies started without spending too much time worrying about legal issues (not so say you shouldn't); once (if) they grew, they could hire enough lawyers to sort it all out on their behalf because money would be flowing. Making shit work was step one. Now, I'm not going to say whether he stole the idea or not. Even if he did, it was the attitude of just doing it that made it the most popular social networking website the planet has ever seen, connecting billions of people. The lawyers will figure out the rest, and this is exactly what happened. 
Others of course are born into enough money to hire as many lawyers as they need, dot all their i's, cross all their t's. Then they hire developers, etc.. this isn't to say that I have anything personally against people that have money and use it, but the path to market is slow, and you can lose your idea to somebody who moves faster; who focuses exclusively on the product; who does it themselves. 
Does money give you a huge advantage when it comes to meeting some of the regulations out there? Yes, absolutely I would argue it's the single largest barrier to entry for most people. Have there been numerous success stories of people who "just did it" then lawyers cleaned everything up? Yes, many of the most successful stories.
With that said, they are who they are, and I do appreciate them bringing the ETF to market. Frankly, they couldn't do it without fitting into the existing regulatory framework. No kid in his dorm room is going to launch an ETF on NASDAQ, and if they do succeed, it really benefits everyone (and deservedly them too). You need money and resources that most of us will never have access to do this. **We can support them for this effort, and we should.**

I like both. Don't underestimate gold though, because it has three clear advantages (not that they make it better on the whole): 1. It doesn't require a digital network, 2. It's a lot harder to lose. 3. It's been around for long enough that it's already an accepted store of wealth. 
With bitcoin, you are dependent on miners to maintain the network, forever. With gold, you are only dependent on miners to extract it, once.
My recommendation to most bitcoiners would be not to attack gold, just as gold bugs shouldn't attack bitcoin. In most cases neither understands the other, and if they did they would see that they both complement each other: there is both overlap in strengths and a set of unique advantages to each that are not shared. 
To do say nothing is to risk nothing. To say something you don't fully understand is to risk credibility. Focus on Bitcoin.

In short, my estimates line up between "big" in an absolute sense, and "plausible" in a relative sense. There is no science here. $400 billion is a big number, but when we compare it to other assets, quite plausible. Because it's big, I start assigning more risk.
The wealthiest 1% in the world own $110 trillion in assets. $400 billion represents less than **0.4%** of that. So it's a lot of money, but not an unreasonable amount of money. People who have a lot of wealth focus on **wealth preservation.** They don't want to miss out on something that could result in them losing some of that wealth, so it's a minor hedge on their part to drive things up. 
The value of all gold is estimated to be worth about $7 trillion. $400 billion is **6%** of that. 
The market capitalization of Apple and Google, are each about $400 billion separately. 
Most importantly, when it comes to valuation, this thing is **global**, and when the infrastructure improves, will be very easy to buy and sell. **Everywhere.**
In conclusion, I don't know.

How does keeping them help the network? 
Let's be clear, Overstock is holding them for investment purposes, and I think that's fine, but that's a risk most businesses can afford to take at this point.
For a low margin business, say 10%, a business that accepts bitcoin to save 3% on transaction fees, etc. can effectively increases net income by up to 30%. Bitcoin is an operational incentive, and they are wise to lock it in.

@_date: 2014-06-24 11:44:47
Technically this makes it more difficult to start a bitcoin exchange service, but the reasons are largely understandable, and frankly, this was inevitable. It gives bitcoin legitimacy.
Previously, FINTRAC did not consider bitcoin to be currency, so you did not technically need to register as a MSB, which has specific and strict requirements related to KYC and AML. However, anybody who contacted them (and they should have because the law was *not* clear previously), would have been instructed that regulations would probably change. In other words, they simply didn't have a law on the books or the mandate to oversee bitcoin exchanges.. yet.
Most legitimate bitcoin exchange businesses would have contacted a lawyer, and a good lawyer would have advised you to put these procedures in place anyways. Larger exchanges like CaVirtex and VoS in Canada already have these procedures in place (as I understand it).
Now bitcoin is on the FINTRAC radar. You need to register as a MSB if you exchange bitcoins. This means contacting FINTRAC and providing them with details about what it is you do when you exchange bitcoins as a business. This will include localbitcoins sellers. Otherwise, you are breaking the law, and could face charges if you operate outside of it. Among the new requirements (besides registering), you will need to ID customers, and report transactions that exceed a certain threshold.
Finally, because this is Canadian law, international sellers and bitcoin exchanges that offer their services to Canadians will also need to follow these regulations. You must be a registered MSB. 
*The good news is that if you use CaVirtex or VoS, nothing should change for you. In fact, it could be argued that this is a good thing--they anticipated where things were going, and there's no obvious risk of shutdown for being out of compliance. Frankly, if an exchange wasn't able to follow these regulations, they probably weren't run well-enough in the first place, and would be cutting other corners too.*
**IANAL, but I recommend that you contact FINTRAC if you are currently operating, or considering operating a bitcoin exchange.**

People are going to keep buying bitcoin because it's scarce and it has value. It doesn't matter if a few hundred people own half today, whether you think it's fair or not. This is the reality of the situation, and I can say this with confidence, because tens of millions of dollars worth are bought and sold daily. 
Nobody stops using the dollar because a small minority own most of them. To the contrary, just because somebody else owns a lot doesn't prevent you from earning more, because the pool is large.

I actually have a wildly different theory when it comes to lower volume: Inter-exchange pricing is becoming more efficient. Consequently, the arbitrage opportunity is smaller, and we see fewer traders taking advantage of any inefficiencies that might exist. This means lower trade volume.

This is literally the least transparent, scummiest company I have ever dealt with. They never notify customers of delay after delay after delay. They just change their estimates on the product description ever time they pass the currently "estimated date" so they can lure new customers.

One of the most vivid arithmetic failings displayed by Americans occurred in the early 1980s, when the A&amp;W restaurant chain released a new hamburger to rival the McDonald’s Quarter Pounder. With a third-pound of beef, the A&amp;W burger had more meat than the Quarter Pounder; in taste tests, customers preferred A&amp;W’s burger. And it was less expensive. A lavish A&amp;W television and radio marketing campaign cited these benefits. Yet instead of leaping at the great value, customers snubbed it.

I did not say that I support money printing,  nor did I say that I prefer it. I did point out that it is offsetting deflation. That's a fact. I did not say that I fear deflation. However, by offsetting deflation it has, to date, done less harm than doing nothing.  I don't know that  this will be true going forwards once interest rates rise. 
Actually, their approach, as crazy as it is, may work. It is quite literally like "pretending nothing happened." They're just replacing worthless assets with cash. It's like cheating. Sort of like (and this is a bit of a stretch) replacing money that disappeared. 
There are consequences though, surely. I do not know what they will be. But I wouldn't write the possibility off. A lot of people think that the government is increasing the money supply by printing. That's not completely true. I'm just trying to lay out the facts, then we can discuss the real consequences.

If this is the case, you may want to include a few questions similar to "Have you heard of bitcoin?" "How well do you feel you understand bitcoin?" and "Overall, do you view bitcoin as a positive or negative thing?" All existing studies I've seen would put the answer to question one around 50%, and the latter two &lt; 50% (currently).
Then you can start to derive conditional statistics.. i.e. "95% of people who have heard of and feel they understand bitcoin well view it as a positive thing... those individuals are X times more likely to donate Y to open source projects." 
Keep really good data on where and how you collect your statistics.
Of course, the most important thing to understand about polls is that they aren't always accurate. People are self-reporting. Actions speak louder than words. Polls can be useful, but they are NOT a substitute for actual research and investigation into real case studies, etc.

I like the Lamassu machine, but a few warnings: 
Because it's small, and takes cash only, it's going to be an easy target for theft. Somebody could potentially put a bunch of money in to buy bitcoins (potentially emptying whatever money you have the exchange you've linked to), and then take off with the machine. It'd probably just take a hacksaw assuming you bolted it down. 
You'll want to pick a good location, and secure it VERY well. 
At the same time, you'd want to be super careful or hire somebody to pick up the cash. You'd be a huge target.
Finally, you'll want it to be in a high traffic/24hr monitored location. Somebody could easily break your machine. The screen is just an android phone as I understand it, and fully exposed. 
What is your current understanding of the licensing you require? As far as I can see, you only need to register as a business in your municipality, with a small fee, and then operate it as a sole proprietorship. 
And what exchange are you linking it to? I'm not sure they support the Canadian exchanges there yet (you'll need an account there, and to load the account with money manually, as I understand it). 
Otherwise, good luck! I was also giving it some thought. On the plus side, a machine is a HUGE hedge against the price of BTC dropping. If it drops, MORE people will probably buy BTC, and you collect the same fee on higher volume.
@_date: 2014-01-24 16:03:09

The attraction was and is that gold is extremely rare, doesn't tarnish, divisible, and can't be faked. It's an element. As a money it too places no power in the hands of a central authority. Unlike bitcoin it doesn't require a mining network to maintain it. Bitcoin is superior for payment and e-commerce, but there's still a lot to like about gold as a store of wealth. 
Bitcoin relies on a distributed network once it's been "mined". Gold relies on no network once it's been mined.

"My understanding of the efficient markets hypothesis leads me to believe it is not."
What is your understanding of the efficient market hypothesis? It was debunked decades ago. The market is rarely efficient, and bitcoin falls into the group of very inefficient. For a few weeks I remember seeing bitcoins trading for $150 more on US exchanges compared to Canadian, AND the CAD is worth less than the USD. 
On that note, 5 figures in 4 hours sounds false to me. Because of the lag in converting BACK to fiat to repeat the the arbitrage, they would only have time to execute a single buy on one exchange/transfer/sell on the other. Let's say they made 100k (the smallest 5 figure amount). Assuming they got in on the $150 gap (a few weeks ago), which is the most I've personally seen, when it was around $1k/BTC, they would have needed to buy and sell 667 bitcoins,  or ~$700k worth. Today, the gap is much MUCH less. They would have to buy and sell MILLIONS of $ worth in a single transaction. Good luck.
Which begs the question: Who the fuck has $700k+ to drop on bitcoins?
Unless they include the xxx.00 in "5 figures"

It all about that ETF. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 20:31:41
The ETF effectively **holds bitcoins** and **sells the claim** on them through conventional investing channels (i.e. You can use your brokerage account at your bank or whatever). This allows investors to buy and sell the *claim* for profit (but not *use* them). This is kind of like how a share gives the investor a claim on the equity of a publicly traded company, but they can't redeem the share for the company's assets directly. 
You can understand how the ETF maintains price efficiency with other bitcoin exchanges by reading this (please read this): 
**The above link is really important to understand how an ETF works. The tl;dr is that ETFs are very transparent and they do hold bitcoins. Arbitrage maintains price efficiency.**
This is important because there are many, many people who know how to buy an ETF through their bank, but don't know or don't feel comfortable with using one of the existing private exchanges (or storing them). 
In my opinion this will be huge for driving the price. Way bigger than people think. People speculate on things all the time. I don't know who wouldn't want a piece of bitcoin in their portfolio. It legitimizes it. It makes it a real investment for many people.
**It will be easier than ever to invest in bitcoin. The catch is that you can't use the bitcoins in the ETF.**

@_date: 2014-06-26 18:03:07
For sure. The ETF is by far the leading driver in my opinion. Many people do not invest in bitcoins because they don't know how or are uncomfortable with the current methods. 
There are trillions in public equity, and those investors are more than willing to buy into a bitcoin ETF, because it's as easy as buying any of the speculative stocks they currently dabble in. 
This will be *the* ETF every investor is going to want even as a small part of their portfolio. I'd expect a short-term bubble, because price will be driven by speculators that won't actually *use* the bitcoins. Long term the technology will mature and become more widely accepted, and assume it's natural role as a transaction medium. (I hope)

The short answer is yes, it is sometimes beneficial to some parties, because of the way the world is balanced today. But no government action involving local currency benefits all parties. It's never that simple. 
bitcoin is simply an alternative, and it doesn't need to have those same characteristics. 
If local fiat is advantageous people will use that. Otherwise, they will use bitcoin.
**My point is, the question is moot. Bitcoin will never be the only world currency. It doesn't need to be. It's better that it isnt. It's a voluntary alternative that has a host of advantages you cannot find in a single local currency today.**

It's true that most people don't know what the stock market is, and fewer still understand the link between stocks and companies: the naive "Stocks go up when companies do well". No understanding of equity, or the difference between ownership and control.

Do not give these guys a single BTC below market value. 
If the seller **calls you** because they want to unload, they might offer you a discount because it would be hard to sell at once without pushing the price down. 
BUt if **you call** the seller, you have to offer them a premium, because you couldn't buy that many without pushing the price up.

One comment: I'm not an expert on ripple, but based on my research and understanding I'm not so sure that you can actually "invest" in it.
 It looks like ripple is about more than xrp, and I'm not convinced that xrp has a lot of value. It sounds like users of ripple only need a few cents worth of xrp to make a lot of transactions. So without looking at anything else, I'm not convinced that there is money to be made there. Ripple isn't so much about a new currency but exchanging existing ones. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

@_date: 2014-09-15 00:01:55


Correct. I was using cash in the colloquial financial sense. 
You have a pretty good grasp of the basic concept; what's your best guess for what we see as a result? Obviously it's not easy to know, and the fed seems to think nothing further needs to be done (on the surface that's hard to argue with).
I think that when we see a "real" recovery, that's when inflation will finally kick in, because the banks retain the mortgage value on what I will call "ghost assets" at their peak on their balance sheets, and assets rebounding create additional "value" in the economy above and beyond that at an unexpected rate. I could be wrong, but it seems like a real risk. As soon as we see real asset growth the pendulum swings too far. In other words, things are only stable in a depressed environment. You can't have your cake and eat it too, so to speak.

Thank you for posting this on reddit, Ben!
Your audience is a critical one, so be prepared for a lot of scrutiny. Surely engaging the public in every way possible is the best approach before introducing any sort of bitcoin-related regulation. 
Please continue to take the time to listen and consider all suggestions, as you have been doing!
Simple and effective regulation is the best kind. Complex and burdensome regulation will stifle many businesses from getting off the ground. Be prudent, be reasonable. Small business exemptions are key. Don't make the kid in their basement an outlaw. Do not prevent them from entering the marketplace. At the same time, bitcoin is not about exempting participants from criminal law. 
I would Err on the side of as much regulation as is needed, but no more than that.

Municipal development laws are driving prices in a number of regions. The cost of many homes that are falling apart is far beyond the cost of building a new home if the land was made available. Trouble is Canadians are obsessed with real estate, and most have no idea how much it costs to build a home. By every measure we are way past the tipping point. The economist has written a number of articles on it, just as they singled out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as early as 2003. The crash won't come as a surprise to a lot of people. Imo many regions are 30-50% overvalued. It's a bubble, but the catalyst to pop it is yet to be seen.

Something interesting: for all my Dogecoin bashing, I was wrong about one thing. Take a look at the network hash rates for Litecoin vs Dogecoin. Dogecoin has more computing power behind it. Crazy, right? Since they are both basically the same coin, I don't care what you call them, the network has the value, and Dogecoin has the larger and more secure network. I was surprised. Most Dogecoin users don't know that either. They could re-brand and easily be worth 10x more (Litecoin is currently valued 10x more than Dogecoin). 
There might actually be something there.

Any time you have the same thing trading in different markets there will be some price differences. Sometimes these differences can be large when there aren't many arbitragers taking advantage of price differences (sometimes they cant), and when the market is small and not completely efficient (like bitcoin).
Why should the price be the same? Its a free market.

Unlike most national money, bitcoin is not backed by promises made by politicians. For some reason this causes tremendous concern for some people. 
Bitcoin is backed by a decentralized network where no single individual holds the keys to change the rules of said network, in which the participants maintain the security of the network because they are rewarded for doing so simply by virtue of the rules of the network. 
Every transaction is accounted for using an unforgeable public property ledger.
As a consequence, tens of thousands of bitcoins are exchanged daily, without anybody's approval or intervention. There have been no incidents of counterfeiting, unconfirmed transactions, or changes to the issuance of bitcoin because some bank or politician thought it was a good idea. All of this is achieved expediently, at low cost, and without any restrictions. 
This is frictionless money. You don't need an account, or to divulge any private information. None of your payment information is exposed when you make or receive a payment. 
The network grows stronger, and more secure every month. 
Bitcoin isn't perfect. It's still an experiment. It's still growing. But the early results are promising. No conclusions have been written, and bitcoin takes no issue with that; it keeps on chugging, every second of every day.
Bitcoin might fail; it might be replaced by something better. But to wonder what bitcoin is backed by is to miss the forest for the trees. 
Edit: It's also backed by nerds. NERDS!

It's not the same. If the bitcoin network went down you can't transact your bitcoins period. With gold you don't have to worry about a network. Whether or not someone wants to accept it is true of both, but that's separate.

OK, comrade. Do some research into applied socialism: communism. You probably won't like it so much. Maybe talk to a few people that lived under it.

Instead it's "how well connected am I to this government official", "we're mostly all equally poor", "it's impossible to run anything", "I have no freedom", "where's my food".

You should be using an *em dash* in place of many of the *dashes* you used (the longer one with no space between it and adjacent words).
For example:
Read the sidebar for community rules—following them will make everyone's day better.
Read the sidebar for community rules - following them will make everyone's day better.
*pro tip: if you use Microsoft Word, type two dashes immediately after a word (no space) and the next word (no space) and it will auto-insert an em dash after you hit the space bar.*
In general, you're over-using the [em]dash too much, but it will look much better when you make this correction. I don't know why this isn't taught in school. In any published text you will find em dashes. Otherwise it just looks sloppy.

That's a good question that I will answer. Here are just three very good reasons:
1. If they're listed on nasdaq, the exchange's reputation is on the line, and there are a number of auditing and legal steps. Big investors will do their homework. Word spreads on Wall Street.
2. Precisely the reason we discussed. Arbitragers profit to bring the price in line with other bitcoin exchanges. The price will be close to other exchanges for this reason. If there were no underlying holdings they couldn't arbitrage. If the ETF is priced at twice that of other exchanges, something is afoul.
3. If it wasn't backed by bitcoins and they somehow got listed and somehow neither steps 2 or 3 came into play, it's fraud. They go to jail (well, maybe).

He's obviously done zero research. "A fixed supply makes it deflationary which is bad." 
Actually, more coins will be mined for at least 100 years, which means the supply is growing. If bitcoin lasts 100 years and it is stable and therefore deflationary going forwards beyond that point, it will be a rock crypto-solid store of wealth and not used for exchange.

Yes, the OP's question is, "what's the value"? Unfortunately many answers, while true, are strictly qualitative in nature, and value for most things requires something quantitative (like stocks). 
Most people don't understand this. A lot of people understand the stock market in terms of "when a company does well", the price goes up, or down, in a relative sense, assuming market efficiency. But this isn't completely true. 
I don't think anybody can clearly assign a quantitative value to Bitcoin in relation to its price. The market has to feel this one out.

Actually, if we've learned anything it's that PR doesn't make an altcoin any more successful in terms of adoption or valuation. They've done the experiment but nobody seems to be drawing the right conclusion. So if you're looking at charity and sponsorship as a way to promote bitcoin, it will not have the desired effect. 
Of course, if you're talking about charity for charity's sake that's great, but this has nothing to do with any manifestation of money (be it cryptocurrency or otherwise), and everything to do with the cause.
The one thing bitcoin can do is enforce transparency on the part of charities and "non-profits".

I'm sorry you got mad. You do raise an interesting point about the consequences of returns in USD when payment is in bitcoins, however. That's something to think about. 
Ideally they would be able to process an exchange in bitcoin to avoid that, which seems possible, but that doesn't seem feasible yet. 
In general, it's always to the business' advantage to offer a store credit, not the consumers, and I think you are being a bit defensive about that.

I think your usage of instantly is fine, and I think I understand bitcoin pretty well. 
From the bitcoin.org website:
- Instant peer-to-peer transactions
- Worldwide payments
- Zero or low processing fees
Let people argue with them if they want to. It's true that it can be a little bit slower at times (minutes), especially if you don't include a fee, but it's pretty instant. Some people experience delays because the exchange or "instant bitcoin purchase service" is slow to release and they confuse that with the network. 
In Canada we have something called interac e-Transfer that lets you send money between Canadian banks "instantly". Free to send, $1.50 to receive. I will tell you it usually takes 3-7 hours, and is of course limited to Canadian banks only. Because of the confirmation time, it's useless as a point of sale service for merchants. It will never be faster because it would compete with their regular service that costs more.

Yea sorry I did extend it a bit. Thought I was fast enough. At the end of the day bitcoin is a very good payment system. This is its attraction. I think charity is great, but I think the idea that the reddit community has to be tipping all the time and shouting "to the moon shibe" is flawed. In fact, many people on that sub reddit have invested thousands of dollars and seen massive losses because of the euphoria. 
I think that Dogecoin has an image among themselves and a few geeks, and bitcoin is evaluated on its merit as a payment system among the broader public. I don't get the "people on the bitcoin subreddit are mean, but it's nice "here" on the Dogecoin subreddit thing." I suspect most people won't and never will. It's a weird internet subculture. It's nice but I don't think it will grow any bigger than it already is.

I think the question is: what if these people *are* holding with the expectation that it is a long term investment because they didn't really understand what they were getting in to?
Why has the price run up? Probably for this very reason.

Okay, you're definitely not a small business owner. It's not *just 3%* to them. It works out to a lot more than that. Remember, that 3% is on **revenue**. Many small businesses and retail have a net profit margin of like 10%. If all their customers accepted bitcoin, that would translate to a 30% increase in **profit** by cutting out that 3% fee, because their costs are fixed. Even if their margin is 30%, they would see a 10% increase in profit. That's big. 
**So, by cutting out credit card fees, many businesses will not realize a 3% savings, but rather a 10-30% increase in profit. The smaller your margins, the greater the increase. Think Amazon, Wal-Mart.**

It seems from your link that there's a lot of evidence regarding what actually took place.

If you really wanted to write the judge for the opposite reason, I don't think that anything would stop you.

Exactly. Simply accessing your blockchain.info backup is not enough. The attacker still needs to know your primary blockchain.info password, which encrypts the backup. Note that this is the ONLY thing they will need to access a BACKUP. Your backup is not protected by blockchain.info 2fa or the secondary password if enabled. They can load the backup into a non-blockchain.info client if they have your primary password.

In general, it's important to understand that bitcoins are not stored in your wallet. They are stored in the blockchain at public addresses. You can only spend bitcoins from a public address where you know the private key. Every private key unlocks a specific public address. 
A wallet is just a collection of private keys. When you first generate a wallet.dat, it creates a limited number of those keys. After a certain number of transactions, the wallet.dat on your pc may contain more keys than the one stored on your flash drive. This is because sometimes new "change" addresses need to be created and used, even though they may not be obvious to you, when you send bitcoins.
For this reason, you would be wise to back up your pc wallet.dat regularly if you use it often. 
Make sure that you encrypt your wallet.dat, and destroy any unencrypted copies. This file is easily accessible to anybody who gains access to your computer. Don't forget your encryption password. I would recommend choosing a complex string you don't use anywhere else, and writing it down in a safe location.
Finally, I would encourage you to research paper wallets, and to make use of at least one. In this case, if you generate it safely, you can send bitcoins to the public address as many times as you want, then spend them by importing the private key in the future. This is the safest way to store bitcoins, and will only fail if a) the entire bitcoin network was compromised, b) you lose your private key, c) your private key is compromised either when the wallet is generated or because somebody discovers it without your knowledge (the actual paper). If you want to be very careful, use bitaddress.org offline from a secure computer/boot session (i.e. boot from a Linux live CD) to generate a paper wallet. As long as you do not lose the paper, there is no need to add an encryption password; the private key is the password.

Um... so the thing with crowdfunding is that they don't take funds from your account unless the thing is funded... 
So, they can't say "0.4 BTC", because that might not cover the cost if the value of BTC drops by the time the campaign ends. The only way to hedge against that is if your BTC is converted to USD immediately... but if funding isn't reached, they would have to convert back, at which point, same exchange rate risk.

Um, isn't it obvious that if bitcoin takes off and this results in the devaluation of the dollar, that it would have massive consequences? Government debt would be worse than it is, people who have saved in USD would suffer, people who receive pensions in USD would suffer. 
Anybody who thinks that Bitcoin *replacing* the USD is a good thing is completely out to lunch. 
But this is moot anyways. Bitcoin has value, and it cannot and will not replace the USD. The government would never allow that, and many of those reasons are completely valid. Fixing the dollar is better than replacing it. Anybody who wants to replace the dollar is an anarchist. 
I think bitcoin has and will continue to have value without replacing the dollar.

One thing I really want exchanges to eliminate are those "kill switches" when the price dives 10% of whatever. All they do is provide a safety for the algo funds. If algos screw up and start selling all their shares at a discount, they ought to suffer for it. Anybody who's rational and understands what they are buying can then make some easy money. 
An easy example of a policy intended to "protect everyday people" that has the opposite effect. If you're going to trade billions of dollars with an algorithm, you ought deal with the consequences when things go bad.
Without any consequences, it's just a game.

First, I'd like to know where you got your 42,520,000,000 ounces of silver number. Never use that source again. It's crap. The silver market is actually about **$20 billion**, more than 30x smaller than what your analysis uses.
Second, dividing the number of ounces of silver by the number of bitcoins is a completely meaningless number. Your silver price (adjusted to bitcoin) is flat out confusing. 
The most reasonable thing you could do is divide the silver market capitalization by the bitcoin market capitalization to demonstrate the premium, and calculate a bitcoin price to arrive at the same market capitalization. Using correct numbers, you'd see that the price of a bitcoin only needs to be about **$1650** before the bitcoin market capitalization starts to surpass the market capitalization of physical silver. 
Note that the gold market is about **$5 trillion**, and for too many reasons to list, bitcoin isn't competing with that yet. Note that **1% of the gold market is $50 billion**, or more than twice the size of the silver market.
Finally, silver and bitcoin actually share very little in common. They both have their advantages and disadvantages. You control ownership of your silver once it's been mined from the ground, independent of anything else. All silver mining could cease today and you'd still own yours. Ownership of bitcoin relies on the *continued* mining of the blockchain; the ledger must be maintained. Bitcoin is not completely trustless. You don't rely on a single third party, but you do rely on the blockchain (don't get me wrong, I think this is incredible). You can send bitcoins electronically, and the number of bitcoins that exist is undisputed. You cannot send silver electronically, and there is some question about how much and where it exists. Anybody who bought in this time last year knows this first hand. A store of wealth maintains your purchasing power. It doesn't grow, it doesn't fall. 
*In my opinion*, silver serves better as a **store of wealth** if you don't trust the banks, but bitcoin is a vastly superior **payments system**. As far as *price speculation* goes, bitcoin has a much higher upside, but also greater downside risk. This should absolutely NOT be confused with a superior *store of wealth*, at least not yet.
I am pro-Blockchain and pro-bitcoin. I think $4 billion is too small. I think we could see $30k/bitcoin, but I'm not betting a lot of money on it. I hope that bitcoin serves the people that need it: the underbanked, and the people who don't have access to mainstream markets. 
The people that work the hardest for the least amount of money ought to be able to send it where they please without penalty.

Small correction, best to hear it here: bitcoin is not infinitely divisible. The smallest unit is to the eighth decimal place. That makes it divisible, but finite.

So, if this person doesn't have reddit, good intentions or not you've basically stolen their bitcoins. The "it was bound to happen anyways" argument isn't bulletproof, and you can't send them back because you've drawn so much attention.
Way to go. 
Better approach would have been to send a public message to that address saying "send the last half of your pass phrase to email address X and I will release your funds."
Or simply to "steal" 1uBTC with a public message warning them that their funds were not secure. Nobody else would notice. 
But there's no glory in that.

Not really. You just have to use bitpay, maybe make a video saying you accept bitcoin. Maybe, oh, I don't know, wearing t-shirts from your company. 
Why don't you design a really, *really* nice t-shirt and give it away as a promotional tool to anybody who buys say 5 t-shirts from you or something? I mean, for the $17+ per shirt you charge, I almost expect there to be a design there in the first place.

@_date: 2014-12-28 16:38:17
I'd call this a **working paper** (another redditor has pointed out quite correctly that they say that it is one in the footnotes of the front page). Of course, part of the reason might simply be that Bitcoin isn't something you can cite from a book like most economics topics. This shouldn't be mistaken for a fault with Bitcoin. To the contrary, it means they need to work harder. I echo other comments in that the use of the word *scheme* is bizarre at best. *Protocol* would have been the obvious choice for a technical paper. If they're reading this, they should make that change or people will judge their paper on this and this alone. With any paper, credibility is important. 
At the same time, I still think it's great that they're trying to research and understand this. It's a good first step, though certainly not authoritative. I applaud the authors on their effort. There's a lot more interesting data they didn't touch. For the same reasons I outlined, this does not surprise me. 
Choosing to write a single paper on both the technical aspects of Bitcoin and data analysis was perhaps a bit ambitious for under 40 pages. If I were a customer for this report, I would recommend breaking this up. The technical details should be concretely defined in one and only one paper. The beauty of Bitcoin is that the data is all there; there's just no established framework for analyzing it, and it's far too early to make any extrapolations.
You could write many, many papers making predications about Bitcoin based on past data. Many of them will be wrong. I point to their focus on Satoshi Dice transactions as one example. While gambling may be a natural application for Bitcoin, there is no evidence to suggest that this will continue to be the dominant application. As the authors have indicated themselves, the volume of transactions (use) thus far has been relatively small. This is completely normal for many disruptive technologies, and should certainly be expected for one that tries to be both a technology *and* money. Consider the VC money pouring into this. There's something here that a lot of people want a piece of. 
Finally, some of the references are kind of.. *meh*. It was probably a mistake to include some of them.
The entire financial industry has good reason to understand Bitcoin. It would be a mistake for them to ignore it, even if *bitcoin* does putter out (personally, I wouldn't bet on it). Frankly, I can't see how bitcoin can't be interesting to anybody who studies economics, whether they like it or not. Anyone watching now has front row seats regardless of the outcome. 
**And** if you're going to *write* something about it, crazy or not you have an audience that is going to want to read it that's larger than a couple of PhDs that subscribe to your journal.

Do you know how HFT works? They don't "predict" where the market is going. They have access to buy and sell orders before anybody else. They act like middlemen. 
i.e. I set a limit buy order at $35. The lowest ask is $34.90. I should get  that $34.90, but the HFT sees my limit price, the ask price, buys it for $34.90, sells it at $35, pocketing the $0.10, and nobody is the wiser. That's HFT 101. It's a joke. It's not a level playing field. It's cheating.

With that said, my point is really that we shouldn't be implementing circuit breaker systems [OP] to avoid free-fall, etc. These things really just protect the bot-runners. It's a safety net for them. This is just painfully obvious to me.

You can ask *"do you accept bitcoin?"*
But **if they say no, don't talk about it anymore unless they ask you to.** A good point to make would be that there are no charge backs, and no fees. If it gets political or about all the negativity, don't engage.

For the love of god don't board the crazy train. If the pattern you are seeing is "price dropping" there are plenty of rational explanations.
Really what we've seen is low volume, thin order book, and a relatively stable price.
1. People selling because they over-invested (did you see those polls)?
2. Large investors who fear regulation.
3. People spending bitcoin. Almost every sale is a sell order on an exchange. 
4. The list goes on....

I think we can all agree on the parallel to be drawn between the internet on the one hand, and the bitcoin protocol on the other. 
However, in terms of investment and money and valuation, the market cap assigned to the group of altcoins appearing (already valued at 10s of millions of dollars  might be compared to what happened turning the tech bubble. In that case, you had companies associated "with the internet", just as you have all of these alts associated "with the bitcoin protocol and cryptocurrencies in general", which are just starting to experience a massive increase in valuation despite being accepted nowhere. Many of the companies during the tech bubble were pumped "because they were xyz.com, and that was a big deal, because the internet was a big deal". 
**Many of those companies disappeared.**

Money is anything used as a means of exchange or payment. Donkey shit can be money, even though it's not legal tender in most countries.
All legal tender = money
All money != legal tender
**bitcoin = money, even though bitcoin != legal tender.** Nobody is forced to accept bitcoin to settle a debt, but that doesn't mean it's not money. It becomes money the moment you transact with it.
Pretty simple concept. You just need to read one sentence from a household dictionary.
Granted, while I may not a lawyer be, I've read MSB policies that apply only to legal tender/foreign currencies, leaving bitcoin out of scope (it is neither). However, MSB policies are also generally written in broader strokes to catch people who try to find loopholes in the eyes of the law.

**Dogecoin is kind of like when your roommate takes a smelly dump. It gets stuck, and you laugh about it. Maybe you take a picture and send it to one of your other roommates. It's stupid, but it's funny.** 
**Then after a while, you try to flush it down, but it just won't go away. A few people hear about this unflushable turd and stop by to point and laugh. They thinks it's funny, but a few start to notice the smell.** 
**One day, a picture starts to circulate on the internet. It's the poop that just won't flush, they say, this will be funny forever! A few people get really excited. "There must be something special about this poop. It's invincible!" Some of them even talk about it regularly.**
**At some point, people aren't going to want to deal with that smelly turd. It won't be funny anymore. They'll do everything they can to get rid of it. Nobody will want to talk about it.**
The dogecoin network is less secure and more prone to attacks because it's so much smaller. It's based on a meme, and memes never last. People who buy dogecoins probably aren't very responsible with money, because it's basically a less secure clone of bitcoin that offers zero advantages. "It's not accepted anywhere? No matter, I like the picture! *I'm diversifying!*"
It was funny for a while, but that's it. If I had any, I'd be putting them into bitcoins immediately. If you're going to invest in cryptocurrency, invest in the most widely adopted one, that has the most secure and attractive features. Today that is **bitcoin**, and because the protocol is *flexible*, I don't see it going anywhere soon. 
Would you invest in some tiny nation's currency for no reason other than because it looked cool? If the answer is yes, dogecoin is for you!

I couldn't be more pumped about the future of bitcoin. 
**You can be sure the big sellers are watching the price incredibly closely to try to time when to get back in.** The moment selling is exhausted, we will probably see a very, VERY rapid reversal. 
Market cap under $4 billion? There's so much runway it's unbelievable. 
Look at all the things that have happened in the past year. 
Krugman has put himself in a corner, instead of acknowledging that bitcoin doesn't fit into any of the classical economic models. This is an experiment that is far from over. Nothing like this has been tried before. You cannot write this off as a Ponzi. Frankly, he should be just as excited to see what happens, for better or for worse, than to try to call the outcome this early in the game. When was the last time the world of economics and finance saw a real technology that can change the way money moves around the world. 
People around the world are accepting money that no central authority controls or issues. And it's *DIGITAL*. Borderless. Immediate. Nobody worries about accepting fake bitcoins. Are you fucking kidding me? This shit is exciting.

Personally I do not want to see fiat currencies fail. A lot of people would be negatively impacted. The life savings of seniors, pensions, etc. Let's hope it doesn't get to that point. Hopefully cryptos provide value as private money, and keep governments honest to maintain fiat stability too.

I'm pretty sure it's the banks that will still be the points of contact in this kind of system.. that's the point, is it not? It's a way for banks to save even more money. It's not like they don't already make massive profits, and if they wanted to pass the savings on to customers they could.

They offer additional hash power to those who ordered before a specific date, which effectively pushes back other customers orders because they have to wait for even more hardware to arrive before their order than they originally did.

This statement is misleading at best, and propaganda at worst. 
**People are ignorant and naive, not because they are being misdirected, but because they are lazy and disinterested.**
This is true of many things even beyond the monetary system concerning many governments and the world in which we live. A more honest film would point out this reality instead of using it to plant the seeds of discontent among the uninformed; a common strategy employed by a number of "documentaries" (like the ones about capitalism).
By the same token, many of these problems are not the result of malicious intent on the part of the mysterious few, but unintended consequences; a result of the sheer size and bureaucracy of government from which few public servants have the understanding, incentives, or ability to instigate change. 
With that said, I watched the whole thing. I question some of the presentation, but some of the information was very interesting, and I have respect for the maker(s?).

Legal tender fiat is accepted everywhere *by law*. A merchant can choose to accept bitcoin, but they cannot refuse the Benjamins. 
Fiat isn't going to collapse, and it doesn't need to. If it did, we'd have bigger problems, and they wouldn't be solved by a rush to btc. 
Don't delude yourself into thinking that a collapse of legal tender fiat is a likely scenario (in most countries--it did happen in Zimbabwe). The odds of this happening are not very high. High inflation/deflation? Sure. 
This doesn't mean that bitcoin is without use. To the contrary I think bitcoin is incredible. The two aren't mutually exclusive. This is still an experiment, with a spectrum of possible outcomes. I'm 99.999999% confident that a world that accepts bitcoin will be a world that also accepts fiat, at the very least for a very long time. The banks will make less, that's for sure.

**Multiple paper wallets using a sha1-verified version of bitaddress.org running from a clean install md5-verified copy of ubuntu on a dedicated offline computer with no wireless card, printed to a dumb printer and secured physically is about as secure as you can get for long term storage.**
If you have a few thousand dollars worth or more I think this setup is mandatory, and I would not trust anything else. 
If you want specific instructions on how to do the sha1 and md5 verification (this is not difficult), let me know. They each take one command-line, and the verified hash string to compare against. This confirms that your version is authentic. If you can follow these steps, you will be putting far less trust in any third party.
I also like the Piper Printer, but you need to take care with the thermal paper. I ran an experiment and taped one of its paper wallets to a window for a month, after which I could not make out any numbers. Stored in a drawer, I noticed no degradation over what is now about six months.

Most people will have one wallet and multiple addresses. I think it is conservative, when you consider that many people will use other clients like armory or electrum or multibit. And few people would download the same client more than once.

Most people don't make money "using the charts". I've read many technical reports and they often have the same disclaimer: "I don't know what this company does or how much they make or lose." 
People usually turn to charts because they don't understand the fundamentals. Financial markets are not always efficient. As soon as you accept price as a proxy for value in place of any financial information, you expose yourself to tremendous risk. It would take all of two seconds to rule out liquidity or solvency risks, but most traders have no idea where to look or how to interpret the numbers.
Trading doesn't require understanding, weighing risks, or critical thought. Just the blind application of recipes and patterns "because this book looks credible"
this is why traders are prepared to sell almost as soon as they buy. They are the complete mercy of the market because they don't understand what they're buying or selling. It's like driving blindfolded. Most technical analysis is a complete joke.

DJesam is correct. Many wealthy people don't pay income tax because they don't work - they invest in private and/or public equity. So their only tax is capital gains, which is less than income tax usually, or in this case, 0. In Canada it's half your income tax rate, in the US I believe it's 15%.

I've seen one for $1000. And really, all you need is a computer or even tablet to set something like this up. A dude running a store could do this on the side with no additional capital cost, from his phone even.


I can't say I'm familiar with African or South American regulations. I'd be surprised if it was more difficult over there. Do you have any sources to back this up? Why would customs be involved? What maintenance? This is about alleviating poverty, and establishing solid financial rules in cryptography. I'm pretty sure Africans will be on board. Ever heard of Zimbabwe in 2009? 


Actually, this is exactly their business model. 


Pretty sure this is what bitcoin has already solved.
**Frankly, this is going to happen sooner than later. First it'll be small remittance shops making big bucks off the bitcoin network, then people will do it themselves because they can.** I think you need to do some more research on what bitcoin is and what bitcoin is not. The bitcoin network doesn't care if you send $1 or $1 million. It costs pennies either way. You don't have any paper work, or have to deal with any central clearing house. The incentives are structured such that the network sustains itself at low cost to the user, with no funny business. 
**Here's the punchline: Western Union spends about FOUR BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR to do what bitcoin can for a fraction of the cost. And bitcoin can do a lot more--it can operate peer-to-peer directly. It limits the number of transactional units. The rules are set and open and transparent. There's no fine print.** The game is rigged in favour of bitcoin. 
Ultimately large remittance companies will be forced to adopt cryptographic payment systems to compete. For a while, they can survive by putting a friendly face on things, but it puts the power in the hands of ordinary people.

Think about it. It's not as simple as every dollar that goes into bitcoin is a dollar they can't control. When you buy bitcoins the seller collects those dollars (they don't disappear). In this case they are stopping dollars from going INTO chase accounts (bitcoin sellers), which means more dollars "they control". They should be blocking withdrawals, not deposits. 
People seem to be confusing this whole notion of "people are using bitcoins therefore banks can't control their money". In a Bitcoin transaction through, say, localbitcoins, dollars are neither created nor destroyed.

I don't think you understand how bitcoin works. 
It's so that they can send money abroad more easily. The receiving end can simply use something like a bitpay address to convert to dollars immediately for free (personal account).
This action does nothing to "pump" the price of bitcoin because it's a buy followed by an immediate sell. 
If the ATM charged a flat couple of dollars they might send 10% or more than they might otherwise have been able.

The private key is concealed, but the public key is shown. The physical bitcoin is "funded" by sending coins to the address. To spend, you have to break it open and tamper with the holograms. Then you don't reuse it.

This is a false analogy.
You have control over your bills. You don't have control over the miners. The miners maintain the network. Not your computer. 
Don't get me wrong. I like bitcoin. But I'm amazed by the sheer level of ignorance I'm reading here. The mining mechanism is still very much an experiment. It's brilliant, but the kinds of things I read imply that bitcoin is somehow "separate" from mining, and that anything you have in cold storage lasts forever--that bitcoin is perfect. 
My guess is that a lot of people have bought into the latter and over-invested.
A solid test will be if we see bitcoin prices drop, with all that mining hardware out there "in the field". If you think bitcoin is immune to a crash of confidence, think again.

I can address this. You see, there are still a lot of dinosaurs roaming the great white north. 
Sure, we dabble in oil and natural resources, but money is big business in Canada. Finance, Banking, and Insurance make up a tremendous part of the Canadian economy, more than most of the world realizes. For many of these industries, bitcoin will naturally be seen as a direct threat to their bottom line. 
I'm not trying to be sensationalist of anything, but it's a fact. This is how disruptive technologies work. When a disruptive technology is basically free, you can imagine the tension it might cause for industries that haven't had to change their business model in decades. Bitcoin is rocking the boat. It's not big enough yet to be of concern, but it's definitely on their radar.
The analogy has been made time and time again, but it's true. The impacts bitcoin could have on money are not unlike the impact the internet had on communication and information.

It's just like many penny stocks. You can see huge swings in market cap with very low liquidity/volume. 
Market cap = # of coins * price per coin. 
If a few well-off (talking net worth north of 50 million, which is quite common actually) people decide to "pump" it, by paying, say $50k at an inflated price (buying up a bunch of the sell side market depth), you'll see the market cap go way up. 
$1.8 billion has not been invested in ripple. A few people paid quite a bit for a small portion of them, and that gets reflected in the "market cap". It's manipulation 101, but I'm not saying that this is manipulation. 
Either way, there are too many other reasons not to buy into it for me. There are too many red flags.

Yes, the ETF will need to buy and sell bitcoins from other exchanges to meet demand. Arbitrage is what keeps the price of an ETF so close to its underlying holdings, unlike say a mutual fund, which operates completely differently--the fund buys and sells the underlying holdings and updates the price once per day.
Arbitragers will buy and sell the underlying stocks based on ETF demand and pricing to profit, which ensures that the two don't get out of line.

Cost of housing in Canada in many regions is beyond this generation's grasp due to development policies that restrict new building, and social protections that mean seniors don't need to sell (No savings? No problem! OAS+GIS~=20k/yr. You can still own your home, retain a significant investment portfolio and collect!), having effectively *doubled* the cost of housing. *Doubling* of housing prices. Do you have any idea how freaking *huge* Canada is? Politicians should be patting themselves on the back. All this for crushing debt levels and underfunded public pensions (nearly 20% of the workforce) that will have to be picked up by those struggling in the private sector. The Canadian bubble never popped. Make no mistake, it's been handed down to the next generation. I actually think that the global financial crisis has in many ways only served to maintain and further exaggerate the Canadian bubble.
Have you seen the TSX? You'd think it'd be resources and oil (certainly nobody expects manufacturing anymore), but in fact its practically all banks and insurance. Public equity markets are *dominated* by the financial sector to the point that one might be forgiven for thinking that they were looking at a financial index. 
Granted, I don't think that bitcoin will solve all of these problems, nor does being born of the boomer generation mean you are the cause of all of this. To the contrary, there are a lot of boomers that have done tremendous things. It's all about shitty, shitty policies. 
It should be interesting to see what happens when interest rates to rise. Taxes are going *to the moon!*

The coinmarketcap.com website uses a different exchange for the bitcoin price. Exchanges are not perfectly efficient. Any time you have people buying and selling things at prices they can set, the same goods can have different prices in different places. 
Some people take advantage of this to turn a profit, and in doing so the price gap between different exchanges starts to close. This is called arbitrage: buy on the cheaper exchange, transfer bitcoins, and sell immediately on the more expensive one. 
The Bitcoin market is incredibly inefficient.
In this specific case note also the exchange rate. Cavirtex is in CAD whereas the coinmarketcap.com price is in USD.

Bitcoin will not replace the dollar. Too many bad things would happen if such a rapid devaluation occurred. It wouldn't be rainbows and fairy tales as some here will tell you. Think people's life savings, pensions, etc. 
What will probably happen is that Bitcoin becomes private money - a liquid and accessible alternative for people. 
This will force governments to stay honest and require them to be far more cautious when it comes to devaluing the dollar. 
The simple reason why bitcoin can never replace the dollar is because it is not and will never be "legal tender". Therefore, legally speaking, no business can actually accept only bitcoin. You must accept dollars as well. This is a funny grey zone, and for now, we do see some businesses accepting only bitcoin. I'm not sure that's legal. It's not unlike a company in the US saying "we only accept Yuan". It wouldn't be legal.

You are placing your trust in the Piper Wallet team. I think they are trustworthy, but that's no guarantee.
You just need the raspberry pi part, then connect it to your own printer. I believe they sell that separately. You can probably do this yourself. 
Whatever steps you take, let me make one suggestion that won't hurt. Download bitaddress.org from Github directly. Verify the sha1 hash. You basically type on a command shell *shasum* /yourpath/bitaddress.blahblahblah. Compare this number for the version you downloaded against the public checksum, here for example: 
This is a safe step to take even if you use the Piper (verify the sha1 hash of the version they provide using shasum). I'd do it ever time you go to use it to make sure the version hasn't been tampered with and is authentic.
As always, never store the private keys and never expose your system to the internet.
Don't get too paranoid! I think limiting it to/recommending 0.1 BTC was your best security decision. As a potential customer I wouldn't be too upset if the 0.1 BTC were stolen (if I funded it). I'd give you the benefit of any doubt.

On an unrelated note, I suspect that for every 1 bitcoiner today who took the trouble to acquire bitcoins, there are at least 100 average joes who are interested but don't want to hand their information over to a private exchange, or are uncomfortable with storage. The ETF serves those people. Of course, I will add that it's a bit unfortunate that the bitcoins held in an ETF will not be used for the reasons that bitcoin was invented (transactions), but this is an expected free market outcome. I truly believe that the day this thing goes public there will be individuals left right and center saying 1% of your portfolio should be in this. Maybe I'm wrong. Time will tell. Hopefully soon. Anyone who owns "paper gold" to use the term colloquially is going to hedge with bitcoin.

A paper wallet consists of a public address and private key on a piece of paper that you can secure physically. 
You need to generate this key pair safely, and keep it secure. Don't show anybody the private key. 
Send bitcoins to the public address as many times as you want.
When you want to spend the bitcoins at that address you need to import the private key into a client like blockchain.info
The question is not "what is the easiest way", but instead, "what is the safest way". 
I recommend using a sha-verified copy of bitaddress.org from Github on a dedicated, password protected offline machine running a clean Linux install OR a Piper Printer. I wouldn't use anything else. 
You don't even need a printer. You can write the address and private key on a piece of paper. The public address can be generated from the private key easily, but not the other way around.
Bitcoins are stored in the blockchain at the address on the paper wallet, and the private key allows you to spend the bitcoins at that address. Bitcoins are not stored on the paper.
It is possible but highly highly highly highly improbable that someone will generate the same key pair as you.
Once you use the private key to spend or send the bitcoins, a paper wallet should never be reused.
There is no spoon.

I suspect that most exchanges will differentiate themselves by blocking HFT and short selling. People who aren't engaged in those activities prefer exchanges that don't allow it. There are several real world exchanges that have these policies in place already.
In fairness, short selling does have some important uses; it helps to prevent bubbles, and prices are really only susceptible to normal short selling when people don't understand how to value the underlying asset (gold, and in all likelihood bitcoin).
Naked short selling is stupid though, I'm not going to defend that garbage.

You are storing the private key. You still depend on the network both to process your transactions and to ensure that your bitcoins remain at that address. You still depend on the blockchain, and miners to maintain it. This is the mechanism that allows bitcoin to operate. I wouldn't call it a flaw. It's an innovation. It's brilliant. But it's still important to understand what it is, and what it isn't.

No I think it's best that we keep working on the protocol, the actual payment system, merchant acceptance rather than shamelessly plaster ads everywhere and pretend that it's because we're "good people". The media is doing a great job getting a lot of bitcoin information out there for free, which makes bitcoin "news" to people, and not just an advertiser. 
Dogecoin is putting the cart before the horse, so to speak. Where is Dogecoin accepted? Where's the innovation? What's their road map? It seems all the serious development and code hardening is happening with bitcoin. 
When I look at their sub all I see are pictures of rockets and pointless memes. Wow. So Moon. Who's evolving the code? It seems really irresponsible to go out and try to get people to invest in Dogecoin. Bitcoiners qualify it as an experiment, recognize that it's not for everyone yet, and work hard at developing the ecosystem. Dogecoiners tell you "it's going to the moon" and buy advertising. Then they repeat to themselves that it's going to the moon day after day. On other days one of them will link to a bitcoin and relentlessly downvote anything they don't like.
When half of the IRL merchants who accept bitcoin start accepting Dogecoin, I'll reconsider. Until then, their priorities seem completely out of line. I can't say I've heard of a single Dogecoin startup, and these are the people that innovate. When is the next Dogecoin conference? 
For Dogecoin to succeed, they need to break free of the circular self-reinforcement and image and focus on the ecosystem. That means real code, access, and innovation.

Maybe. I would argue that the Bitcoin protocol as it exists today is most valuable as a crypto store of wealth, where others to come may be more valuable when it comes to immediacy and cost efficiency.
Of course, as indicated, nothing prevents the protocol from changing. But that's another can of worms. Ask yourself, for a decentralized currency, who controls the source? Its open (readable) yes, but only a few have write permissions ;p
All else held equal, however, I personally believe that Bitcoin has the advantage, and it's the only cryptocurrency I hold. at this stage at least. Most alternatives are directly derived from the original bitcoin source, and so they offer little bitcoin could itself offer through protocol adjustments. 
And I don't know that anything more complex will offer significant advantages. A more secure encryption will probably be necessary when quantum computing is realized (I say 5 years), but that's basically just a library you add to the protocol, and I'm sure they will come on the scene and be integrated before they are needed.

This is just false. That subreddit is spawned from childlike jealousy that a few people got rich. They cannot rationalize this, and so they spend hours every day attacking it, under the misguided notion that by "exposing the fraud" anyone in bitcoin will lose money, making themselves feel better for it. 
Make no mistake this have everything to do with missing out. **Resentment.** If the price dropped to a $1 and nothing changed about bitcoin these guys would be buying up in droves. 
The overwhelming majority of people on that sub are jealous assholes. A fraction is legitimate parody. This is obvious because they often post fake posts on this sub or bitcointalk then attack it. Baiting is not the same as calling something out. It's malicious.
The higher the price goes the worse this will get. It's incredibly immature. *"Bobby got a new bicycle so I'm going to make fun of him so everyone sees what a dweeb he is. I should have that bicycle."*

Dogecoin is the joke that didn't go away. Like a smelly turd that your roommate dropped--it was funny for a while.
Dogecoin doesn't have staying power because it offers zero benefit over bitcoin and is accepted nowhere. And memes never last. It's more susceptible to network attacks, so I wouldn't have money in it. To use dogecoins you need to convert to bitcoins. Why add the risk?
It's quite literally like saying "I'm going to convert these bitcoins into this less secure thing because it has a meme". The few that are mining it are the exception. But anybody who actively purchases them isn't being very rational or prudent with their money.

What I am interested in are his comments on bitcoin. Can anybody fill me in on the following points he made:
1. Bitcoin is really **not an improved payments mechanism.**
2. The **fees are not cheaper than credit cards.**
3. The transactions are **slow.**
4. There's **no consumer protection.**
I realize this is an interview, so he can't go through and expand on all of his points, and Max didn't challenge him on them so there was no reason to, but I'm at a bit of a loss here after watching Andreas' Canadian Senate appearance.

The funny thing is that vix "trends" to zero over time, so they have to keep splitting it. It was funny when some investors and certain unnamed "tv spokespeople" were saying "buy the vix to hedge against volatility", without adding the qualifier that it is not a long term hedge against "inevitable volatility", but rather a very very short term instrument where if there is not volatility soon, you'll never make back your investment.

I'm honestly getting tired of reading this. We've addresses this so many times. They are complimentary. Bitcoin is the most superior means of transaction (including the e-commerce), that may also serve as a digital store of wealth, but this hasn't been proven yet. It will take decades to even begin to draw this conclusion. Gold is still a preferred method of wealth storage, for a number of reasons including the fact that it relies on no network at all. Once it's mined, it's yours. It's an element. If they stop mining it's still yours, and won't simply "vanish". With bitcoin, once it's "mined", the network must continue to maintain the ledger. Both put no trust in a central authority. The blockchain is a maintained cryptographic ledger which allows for immediate transaction worldwide. But it still needs to be maintained. Gold puts it's trust in nature: an element cannot be forged by anybody. 
I love bitcoin, but it will not and does not need to replace gold as a store if value. Too many gold bugs don't understand bitcoin, and too many bitcoiners don't understand gold, and yet both are prepared to denounce the other out of fear.

The article is very VERY poorly researched. "Difficulty went up therefore profitability went through the floor." Absolutely not. The author has obviously done zero research on the cost of mining. Anybody with the right hardware ON HAND was making a ton of money in november/december. 
This is a clear example of armchair analysis based on generalized postulations and no empirical numbers. Even with difficulty up, at these prices, miners (those with 2nd gen hardware) have been laughing all the way to the bank.

I don't think most "bitcoiners" are looking to evade taxes. Taxes are too high, but evading them isn't the solution.
First, you're talking from the perspective of somebody that lives in a stable, first world country. 
Second, the benefits of bitcoin run much deeper for merchants and consumers. For example, if you accept credit cards, you are charged about 3% of your sale. If you accept bitcoin there are no monthly fees, and it costs no more than pennies.
On the more political side of things, a lot of people don't like dealing with banks that scoop up billions, nor are they terribly fond of the fractional reserve system of banking. They'd rather use money as money--a peer-to-peer system of exchange without any intermediaries that may inflate the money supply.
This is about freedom of choice. You don't have to stop using the dollar. If anything, an alternative like bitcoin should force governments to be more responsible with their money.
More than anything, whether you like it or not, the technology is here to stay. 
**It has the properties of gold with the convenience of email.** The ecosystem is growing, fast. Security is improving for end users, as is ease of use. All this without any centralized authority. 
Whether you like it or not, this is huge. This is global money. No single party takes responsibility for it and it works really, really well.
@_date: 2014-07-31 12:41:34

FYI, saying you "don't have any real evidence... *but* google" doesn't actually strengthen your case. 
Allow me to offer a good explanation. There was a $1 million sell order sitting on the books during the crash. That order was removed. It never went through. That person probably decided it was better to keep those bitcoins off the exchange, so they withdrew. Daily transaction volume is usually less than $50,000.

I think the problem is that media coverage has been leading the Bitcoin infrastructure, and if the media gets bored we may lose that coverage before all the ATMS are up, which have the greatest potential to influence price.

I think I understand your source of confusion. You seem to think that a paper wallet removes bitcoins from the Blockchain (stores them on paper). This is incorrect. All bitcoins are accounted for in the blockchain. A paper wallet simply means that the private key associated with one of those addresses is only stored on paper, and not on your computer, or with a 3rd party. 
A paper wallet is just a public/private key pair that is generated and saved offline.

There were articles in The Economist specifically pointing to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the dangers of the US housing market as early as 2003. 
The thing is, lots of people love to say "I predicted it", or "This is the guy that predicted it", but a SHIT TON of economists and financial professionals warned about it in advance. I've heard stories of run-of-the-mill financial advisers (not famous for anything) instructing their clients to pull out of stocks in 2007. 
The official government response: "Nobody could have seen this *crisis* coming." And people believe it.

Most of those downloads have been in the US, then China, at a ratio of about 2:1.

So what prevents me from looking at your bitcoin address, and picking the send address of someone else's payment, and spoofing it as my own before the real buyer completes the form?
You simply cannot accept bitcoin this way. 
You need to generate a unique address for each buyer yourself, or go through a third party, which isn't expensive because it's bitcoin.
You can fix this!

A BitPay personal account has 0% fee if the recipient wants to convert to USD immediately.
If you're prepared to wait up to 72 hours it costs you nothing to send. This obviously has an exchange risk where the value could drop. If you want to send it immediately about 5 cents.
Your fee to convert to bitcoins could well be under 0.5%. This will likely drop over time and become a flat fee.
All in all, about 10 cents to send if you play your cards right.

No. Authorized participants can arbitrage between their ETF and any bitcoin exchange they want.

He didn't quite get it right. Yes it depends on electricity and the internet, but more fundamentally it depends on the network -- the miners. If they stopped your bitcoins in cold storage are no longer secure or useful. 
If they stop mining gold the gold in your vault stays there. 
Don't get me wrong I own both. As a speculative investment bitcoin has a much higher upside.

So... to comply with basic anti money laundering laws a centralized exchange makes a boatload of sense, because they and only they verify buyers and sellers. Otherwise you have to give all your personal info to some random dude or be subject to the consequences of the law, at least in the US. Just saying it like it is. You can't legally and safely do a "decentralized exchange". Localbitcoins is a massive grey area.

You don't understand firmware signing. 
I've commented on two separate comments you already made, and yet you still make this post. 
USB sticks run firmware. That firmware can be compromised and there's nothing you can do about it. This has everything to do with trust. Trezor is about trusting their firmware, which goes much deeper than the firmware in a regular USB drive. It's not about "USB is broken, therefore you can't trust Trezor."

I think you're countering one extreme with another. The problem here is that some people were leaving most of their coins in exchange wallets for prolonged periods of time (weeks, months) for the purposes of speculation. I can guarantee you that many of these people were running trading bots they didn't even write that come with a host of other risks. It only takes 10 minutes to send BTC from a wallet you control to the exchange if you want to sell them. This doesn't take mt gox off the hook, but it's important to understand. 
Control of your money is what bitcoin is all about, and it's only true when you actually take control.

I agree with you in principle (I read what you wrote several times). It *would* be great if private equity were more accessible to all. It's a larger market. I think part of the reason that they limit it to highlight net worth individuals is because of the sheer overhead it would involve to track micro-investments when there is no "exchange". They don't *need* to go after the small money, because the big money is there. However, maybe Bitcoin (the technology) can help change this. 
Private equity is in many ways riskier, largely due to the fact that there are no reporting standards. However, it could be argued that most public equity investors don't look at financial statements anyways (sadly).
I will say your tone was a bit angry, to the point that I had to spend more time getting the objective substance of your post, which has merit. Don't be so angry! I.e 


I don't know that this is the actual reason, but the real reason may not matter. The fact that you can't easily buy private equity matters.

It's not just electricity that maintains the bitcoin network. It's the voluntary use of computing power on the part of miners for compensation.

Many startups don't attract the same level of funding as many alt coins.

They buy *everything* and call it "diversification". 
Alts are kind of like otc or pink sheets, but it's mind boggling easy to exchange for them.

Right. I think we both agree that going forwards it will probably have consequences. Although, I will be the first to admit that I don't know, precisely, what those consequences will be. I only understand what they are doing now. Of course, banks and governments have benefited from QE.  No doubt. But one could also argue that anybody holding debt or employed would also have suffered. Basically anybody who had (even cash) savings, and no need for employment, would also have benefited had QE not been instantiated. To some extent, it may also have made "the rich richer" in terms of purchasing power had QE not been introduced. Think about that. Anyways, we will find out in a few years I'm sure :)

Does anybody have the numbers that he uses to reach this conclusion? 
Even if this were true, isn't it a short-term way of looking at things? In a few years fewer bitcoins will be issued as rewards, and yet we will still have miners running their equipment. Bitcoin doesn't need everybody to be mining. By nature it can never be profitable for everyone. That isn't a bug. Isn't this inflationary reward a good feature to have to jumpstart the system? I mean, can't we say it's worked--by design?

This is correct on many counts, but it's not quite so simple to say that it's good for everyone with a positive net worth. During periods of deflation wages drop too. Many people who need to work suffer, including those living pay cheque to pay cheque. Most people do not have high net worths. They still need to work. Those that have saved enough money to the point that they no longer require employment stand the most to gain from deflation.
So, if you're wealthy or retired, yes, bring on the deflation. Obviously there are shades of grey here, but I'm trying to illustrate a much overlooked point.

I would not invest in viacoin.
Frankly, it doesn't sound like something one does invest in. As far as transactions go, as "money" and a store of digital wealth, bitcoin seems a lot better. 
Viacoin is about other things, and I don't see an individual viacoin as something that has value. 
To me, it's akin to XRP and Ripple. Ripple is this payment "thing" and people thought (and some still think) well, I like the sound of Ripple so I'd better buy XRP, when this doesn't make any sense. 
Be honest with yourself. You want to buy in because of 1. The enormous price run up and 2. Some scattered hype from current investors. 
What does viacoin achieve as digital money that bitcoin does not? 
**tl;dr even if viacoin does all this tree chain rah rah rah stuff really well, I do not see how one can rationally "invest" in viacoin as a digital money by buying viacoins. It doesn't seem like the value of viacoin is as a digital money.**
Bitcoin is not broken. Viacoin isn't so much of a better "coin" as it is a platform for other things that may have value, which would be independent from viacoins themselves. Even if you like viacoin, you can't really invest in it.

Right. Like the internet and tech companies. The internet prevailed of course. People were right, it had value. But at the same time everybody was pouring money into tiny ventures simply because they had a website and some sales pitch. They were like the internet only by association. I think we can draw a parallel there to the many alt coins popping up. There is a definite valuation risk for many of those coins. They might never be used by anybody, like many of those tech companies that made no money. That risk is only just starting to build.

For a decentralized currency to work, people need to allocate computing resources to it. This is happening now with Dogecoin. I'm thinking that as silly as the name is (some say it's approachable, but I don't think everybody will agree), the network has the most value, and the "community" is important at this stage. At some point I think dogecoin is going to fork into a new more generic branding (I know, dogecoin people are going to hate me), on the existing network of computing resources people have built.

This isn't the most secure method. The version of bitaddress.org you see *could* be compromised. It's best to download it from github and verify the hash signature. However, all things considered I believe this is secure enough for the project you are doing. I have not heard any stories about compromised paper wallets generated from bitaddress.org through any means.. yet. I would recommend making your method clear, and that while you have taken all precautions you saw fit, you cannot guarantee security.

I use CaVirtEx and I think they're great. I think your post is incredibly obnoxious "walking around like they own bitcoin in Canada". Really? Do you have a source on that?
Their bill payment deposit option for $5 is great. 1.5%/buy or sell isn't that unreasonable. I wish their level 1 verification allowed for a slightly higher direct deposit (withdrawal) to my bank account, but I think they're trying to minimize (and hopefully eliminate) their exposure to criminal activities. 
It took a month for me to get verified. Not amazing. But guess what? It worked out for the best. The price actually dropped. I would have been buying at $1200. Instead, I get in under $800. It was to my advantage (luckily), so I don't complain about it. 
My understanding is that based on Canadian laws, they don't actually NEED to collect any personal information, but I appreciate that they are trying to be transparent about this. It's about long-term viability, and I support that 100%. 
Maybe you shouldn't be harassing them throughout the verification process and over the holidays? They're just people man. Relax. And why are you calling VOS after hours? Is that really necessary?
I don't think they're perfect, but I think they're growing, and I will definitely support them and be a customer. It will be my go-to exchange now that I've been verified. I would like to see them maintain their position of largest exchange in Canada. More exchanges = more competition, yes, but it also = more fragmentation, and for bitcoin, I think a single point of exchange for Canada would be good. I don't think they're going to jack up their rates (I don't think they will need to), so I'm not worried about getting "ripped off". I think it's fair. I'll pay more for a well-run exchange. 
I hope you find something that works for you. But don't try and steer everybody to "your preferred exchange". 
I hope somebody from CaVirtEx addresses your post.

My analogy could be far off, but it feels like derivatives in the financial market. 
It's like "our alt coins aren't working, so let's build off bitcoin instead".
Why is it not better to leave bitcoin alone and keep it simple when it comes to side chains and what have you? Why not build friendly applications intended to simplify bitcoin transactions, instead of more complicated stuff where it's like "this is sort of bitcoin, but it's also not, but it kind of is too.. maybe"?

This conclusion doesn't always follow the statement you made.
From the rest of your post I'm not convinced you understand how ETFs work.


This statement just boggles me. It's going to be a NASDAQ listed ETF, so they have serious compliance issues in terms of backing. Your statement about delivery and price detachment isn't exactly logical. 
Here's the key. Real market demand through conventional brokerage accounts will exceed supply on the current exchanges big time for a number of reasons. Consequently, you're going to see the price go up huge as we see creation units being formed simply because many joe's look to add a 1% hedge or gamble and bitcoin fits the bill more than anything out there. 
Anybody who read this far, if you don't understand how ETF pricing works through arbitrage, you don't know how an ETF works, and anything you say doesn't add much to the conversation until you do.

A lot of these cryptos have the same protocol but with a few different parameters, or a different hash. Many are derived from the original bitcoin source. So in that sense, many are quite similar. 
I see bitcoin as leading, for three simple reasons: 
1. The network is the largest, and therefore, by most metrics, most resilient and secure. This cannot be underestimated. Whether it can be sustained is anybody's guess, but for a decentralized network to operate, having a network (most people can only commit to currency x, y, or z, because resources are limited) is incredibly important.
2. It has the most coverage, and therefore the largest infrastructure (and growing). Most startups in crypto are investing in bitcoin-centric services, and they will want to see it succeed.  
3. Most importantly, the protocol is flexible. It's code. It can change. Like a search engine. 
A lot of .coms weren't simply about not sticking. Some succeeded by any normal metric, but made far, far less money than investors had expected, because they paid *way too much* for them. This was the case for many larger companies who acquired a lot of these smaller guys, only to write them off years later.

Yes. This is the mechanism that keeps the ETF price in line with the bitcoin price. Arbitragers have a profit incentive when the two are out of line. When they take that profit the pricing gap closes. In order to take advantage of it, bitcoins must be bought from, and sold to, the fund.

Profiting from the difference in price on multiple exchanges is nothing new. People do it, and it's got a name: arbitrage. Through the arbitrage profit mechanism markets become more efficient. ETFs have an arbitrage mechanism that keeps their price closely in line with the price of their underlying assets.
The Bitcoin market is grossly inefficient (the price differences you pointed out), so you can expect that people are doing just this. The more people doing it, the closer prices will trade between exchanges. Some people will write software to do this automatically.

I still believe in the incentive mechanism of mining to maintain the blockchain. I'm just saying such a mechanism isn't required for gold because it's an element--not a network or code. It's not exactly a flaw. The fact is, the internet and electricity aren't going anywhere, and basing your investment strategy off of this is lunacy. You cannot transact gold over the Internet like you can bitcoin. I'm just pointing out that the ledger mechanism doesn't exist for gold. I'm not saying I believe it's flawed. 
Bitcoin should have never worked because of the chicken and egg problem between security and adoption. But it did. It's been 5 years. It's very hardened and there are many interested third parties who profit from the decentralized mechanism of mining. It's attacked all the time. 
Like I said, I own both (mostly bitcoin though, I own less than half an ounce of gold mostly for interest). All considered I believe it's the better investment.

On remittance payments it's in the right ballpark..
African remittance payments total about 40B annually. At about 10%, they pay twice what many pay in other countries. So, if their rates were in line with the rest of the world, 1.8B saved is close. 
If remittance payments were **$0**, they'd save about 3.6B. 
My understanding is that *global* remittances are on the order of 500B. There's about 40B to be saved if it were "free". Individually those rates vary from 1.5% to 20% or so depending on where you are. Imagine paying **20%** to send money to your family! It's outrageous.
I'd say solving the African remittance fees would be great! They deserve to send every penny.

It's FUD because you added zero context. Post that this represents less than 1% of the volume over the past 24 hours, and I'll upvote you. 
You're using selective data. This is not a significant source of selling pressure. 
I could write that peercoin has daily volume of less than $200,000 (nothing, there is no demand). But it would be out of context with peercoin's market cap.


You switched for this reason only? Are you serious? There's far more at play than this analysis. You're not the only one who understands the difference between POW and POS. I *like* POW. I think it's good that mining is "expensive" (not on a relative network scale) during the discovery period. You seriously think &lt; 1% of daily volume (now) is a problem? This is a poor reason to switch to peercoin.

Look up the cost of constructing a home. I'll tell you it's about $150/sqft for a well provisioned **single-detached** home. Condos? &lt;$75/sqft. You can do the multiplication I'm sure. Then consider the amount of available land. This is Canada. We have a ton. Now check out the prices. In many areas, 8-10% YOY for a decade? That's like $1000/month for many homes. I can assure you that the cost of construction hasn't gone up that much :)
Put 2+2 together. The valuation is in the land. In some major cities this makes sense, but when you look at MANY municipalities across Canada, there's no short supply.
This bubble is driven by municipal planners. A few people are inadvertently pushing prices up, because of the laws they pass. In the name of green space and anti-sprawl, most of these policies are quite simply anti-poor.
And that's just one metric. We can talk about rents, we can talk about incomes.
Follow that up by looking up median household net worth on stats can. Observe that net worth increases have *only* gone up with housing values. 
Then consider the cost of retirement, and the fact that most Canadians' net worth is derived from housing appreciation.
It's coming. You're right, we probably won't have the same flash crash like in some pockets of the US, but when it happens, it's going to be persistent. 
Canadians love real estate, but they have no idea how to value it. For many people, unless you're employed by some level of government, or rich, you don't have the stable means. 
30-60% over valuation in many areas. The only thing that can maintain this is foreign money. We are WAY overdue for a correction. This is completely unsustainable. All it takes are a few laws expanding development zones. In some places, provincial housing boards are in the process of ruling towards this as we speak. It's completely artificial.

While I don't agree with the money printing, no, it actually hasn't made things worse. It may make things worse in the future. The money printing today is actually stabilizing the money supply. When the value of those subprime mortgages collapsed, the money supply actually collapsed. 
Money printing is, today, offsetting deflation, by replacing those worthless assets with cash: "let's pretend nothing happened."
Deflation is horrible for anybody who has debt (governments).

Rich people will hedge because that's what rich people do, and bitcoin will be the most interesting hedge around.
They just need something that they understand and trust before they can do it. The ETF will do that. NASDAQ will legitimize it. The ETF will do to bitcoin what it did to gold. People invest in ETFs they don't understand all the time because it's incredibly easy. The BTC market cap is peanuts compared to the money that's ready to move into speculative vehicles. 
At the same time, independent of price, infrastructure will continue to grow because it's cheap and open. 
Bitcoin is here to stay, because talent (and money) is moving in. 
At the same time I expect that the pool of interest in altcoins will start to dry up. The bar is so low that all kinds of slime are trying to pump their own buck. These are rarely the most talented folk, and it's quite often not their first scam. The people getting burned take notice.

You realize the high cost of (primarily) housing over there is because of foreign money and NOT a reflection of the wages, right? It's money in the bank that gets transferred overseas.
This is why we keep hearing about your couples getting scammed out of $25k on rent. It's like pocket change. 
My point is, $80k USD is not lower-middle income in Vancouver. Scraping by, yes. But it's well in the middle of salaries people actually EARN over there.
Economically, Vancouver is not at all like Hong Kong. The money from Hong Kong just makes its way over. As Hong Kong's economy goes (and China's anti-corruption policies), so will Vancouver's real estate. 
Also food isn't really more expensive over there either :p

My gut feel is that ripple is not for me. The extraordinarily low volume every day also concerns me. 
I've been following it and see about $73k trade daily. That's 0.004% of that "1.88 billion". Of course, because it's mostly pre-mined, and in such a large quantity, small trades can greatly exaggerate the market cap.

Even if we agree inflation is higher, a sudden devaluation from bitcoin adoption could easily eclipse that and in a very short period of time. Again, I'm playing the devils advocate here. You would have to be kidding yourself if you thought bitcoins would be good for everybody.

They purchased worthless mortgage-backed securities at face value. 
Basically they *replaced* part of the money supply with "cash", because that part of the money supply went poof. Those mortgage-backed securities weren't worth the paper they were written on.
QE was used to provide liquidity and prevent deflation. Basically the FED "bought" those securities with money they created, to pretend this whole thing never happened. They don't plan to do anything with those securities. They don't need to.
Banks are the biggest winners. The logic being that by not having failing banks the consumer wins. 
True to some degree. 
But there were not many consequences for those responsible. 
Does anybody know what the long term consequences will be with absolute certainty? No. 
Did QE keep things from getting worse? Probably. 
These are the facts as I see them, and I think bitcoin has tremendous value.
Where is that money now? Banks have most of it, instead of those worthless mortgage-backed securities. They don't know where to put it, because nothing compares to those "AAA" toxic mortgage-backed securities they used to be able to count on for yield. The stock market has benefited. Where else can it go? 
There's a yield void; the last one was a house of cards. 
Over time, this will be corrected. Nobody knows how long. This is what the FED is trying to determine. On a relative scale, I'm pretty confident in the US economy.

QE has simply been compensating for the massive deflation that occurred when the housing market tanked. They basically just replaced worthless assets with cash on banks' balance sheets. 
The money supply hasn't actually grown as a result. They've largely just been buying mortgage-backed securities that are frankly worthless, at full value to "pretend this never happened." These worthless assets are technically of no consequence to the FED. It's kind of like if a bunch of money in an account just vanished into thin air, and they replaced it. No inflation. It prevents the deflation that would otherwise occur. 
That's not to say that everything else is Rosy. Government debt and bloated public sectors are a real problem. Jobs have been lost, and many countries are covering it up by hiring huge numbers of public sector workers. This is unsustainable. 
The US is doing pretty well compared to most of the world. If you're an American, things are much better than you probably think. There still is a pretty solid economy. Think about most of the world's largest companies and where they're based.
@_date: 2015-03-05 00:04:14
So, exciting yes, but as an investor you need to see major volume increases or bitcoin price appreciation. And in the latter case, you're certainly better off investing in bitcoin.
They do 400 BTC volume today. At $350 CAD/BTC that's $140k daily,  or $50 million a year. At 0.5% trading commission, you're looking at $250k gross revenue. 
To be publicly traded, I'll bet their CFO pulls in at least that amount. Bottom line, they need to see a big bump in volume.  VoS couldn't do it. CAVIRTEX couldn't do it. What makes these guys think they can do it? 
I wish them luck, but I'd sooner buy the asset.

This is a terrible argument. Gold is a rare element that doesn't tarnish. It never changes and it can't be forged. That's why it's valuable. Once you have it, you don't rely on continued mining to make it valuable.

He doesn't understand the inseparable mechanism that allows the blockchain to function; *the incentive for people all over the world to use their economic resources to maintain the blockchain, which guarantees global transactions almost immediately and at the fraction of the cost of a third party:* bitcoin (lower case). That's why it's *decentralized*. That's why it's practically *free*. That's why it's *trustless*. That's why it works. 
bitcoin allows the blockchain to function which in turn allows bitcoin to function. This is the chicken-and-egg story that continues to hatch, having been born against all odds. Without the blockchain you have no bitcoin. Without bitcoin, you have no blockchain.

Bitcoin relies on continued mining for it to work. If it does not work it has no value. Once gold is mined once, it will continue to work without any further mining.. 
Bitcoin is not superior to gold in every way.
Bitcoin is *software*, with its advantages and disadvantages. Gold is an *element* with its advantages and disadvantages. They have similar utility but they are not the same. I would not use the price of one to estimate the price of the other. 
I think all this talk of "Litecoin being the silver to bitcoin's gold" is misleading and has done more harm than good in understanding the value of bitcoin.
If you want to arrive at a reasonable estimate, I would instead consider the number of people who might have the desire to hold bitcoin, and multiply it by the average amount they might hold. Today that's about 3 million people holding an average of $1k worth. Obviously this is skewed by early adopters, but you get the idea.

My point is, their questions didn't require you to give up any personal information. You're overreacting or paranoid.

This isn't what happened. The value of mortgages on banks' balance sheets was basically wrong, because the market crashed. So all those mortgage-backed securities that they counted on for asset value was incorrect. The FED "bought" those worthless assets at face value (they just replaced them with cash), so banks didn't see any change in their solvency or liquidity
I'm not saying I agree with it, but QE is just offsetting deflation. 
They aren't adding money to the market. They're replacing bad assets at face value.

Greece is the last country on the fucking planet that would tie their currency to anything. They need to devalue their currency because their social system is broke as shit and costs too much. 
Their best course of action is to:
1. Default (they'll never be able to borrow again).
2. Fire half the public sector (because they can't borrow to pay them anymore). 
3. Try to stimulate private investment and attract foreign money by offering as many non-financial perks as they can because there's nothing their government can spend to solve this.
4. Their citizens will have to deal with low employment (the government won't just hire you because you don't have a job anymore) until *something* happens. Who the fuck knows what, here's to hoping.
Frankly, **I'd get out the fuck out of Greece.**
The root of their problem isn't a bad currency. It's systemic, and it's caught up with them. It's the economy, stupid! There isn't one. There is no easy or obvious solution. This is what happens when your economy is a ponzi scheme. Who knows what the outcome will really be. Their population isn't used to austerity. That's why they broke.
Tl;dr If you're a citizen, buying bitcoin *might* be a good idea. If you're the government, backing your currency with bitcoin is a terrible idea. If they could afford to *invest* in bitcoin it might pay off, but Greece doesn't have room to gamble, nor would it be enough.

As an unrelated point of interest, while I don't "like" quantitative easing, it's not causing inflation right now (yet) for a very logical reason.. it's actually offsetting deflation because all of the toxic assets on banks' balance sheets from 2008 were worth less than they borrowed against.. there would have been a massive contraction in the money supply. Not taking a side on it, just stating a lesser understood fact.

There is no "public key", "private key", AND "corresponding address". There is only a public address and a private key to that address (like an email address and a password).
You can easily calculate the public address from a private key, but not the other way around. Wallets can therefore be thought of as collections of private keys (which are just alphanumeric strings).
Your generalization of the word address has confused you.

You will need to do your research. In my opinion, crypto-currencies are going to be a winner-take-all if they gain any traction, like facebook, or twitter. It's a medium of exchange, and merchants aren't going to want to accept everything. There's a reason your local store usually only accepts one, maybe two currencies. 
Such a currency will also have to be stable, and even bitcoin isn't there yet. 
So, my opinion, bitcoin is your best bet at this point. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:14:38
On the ground level, I'm sure most people have seen the news and thought, "Okay, I"ll buy $100 USD.

Well, it doesn't matter, I can't seem to buy them anywhere anyways."

I wish you all the best with your business, but difficult question: 
How do you insure an entire market? The insurance model is based on collecting fees from lots of people who are exposed to risk, where only a small portion will ever need to collect. 
It seems you have a binary outcome here; either you continue to collect fees and don't pay out, or the price crashes and you pay out to everybody (and lose, and probably can't cover everything). 
Please do correct me if I'm wrong, just poking at this concept to see if it holds water.

Yes, there is a similar analogy with gold miners and the price of gold. Average mining cost is like $1250 per oz of gold, as price dips below that many miners shut down. 
BTC price is ridiculously high for many miners with the right equipment. They are making a ton of money. This suggests that BTC may be overvalued using this metric alone (obviously I can't exclude demand, but I'm focusing on one variable).
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:37:20
Price drops only occur when buyers aren't confident in the asset they are purchasing (if you could call Bitcoin an asset). And if people aren't confident in what they are buying the price should be lower. This is how markets work. This is just the start. We will see $300 before we see $1500.

Bitcoin-QT is the standard 
"Bitcoin-Qt is a full Bitcoin client and builds the backbone of the network. It offers the highest levels of security, privacy, and stability. However, it has fewer features and it takes a lot of space and memory."
If you have no problem with using 20 GB+ of your HD for it (it downloads the entire blockchain, and updates all transactions), this is the one to go with.
Encrypt it, and back up your wallet.dat to USB periodically.

I don't think that enough evidence was presented to support the claim that an extremely deflationary tendency is not a problem for a currency. Some people are spending their bitcoins, yes, but overwhelmingly I would say that people are not. The price is being driven up because people are buying and holding. That's what I'm doing, that's what most people are in fact doing. Only people who have committed to holding all of their assets in gold, for example, will in fact liquidate it to buy their groceries. Bitcoin has an incredible protocol for exchange, but I don't think that's what it will be used for. I'm not trying to "troll" or be "confrontational", but I think there is more value in acknowledging a weakness and trying to figure out how to correct or work around it than to dismiss it. 
People are absolutely hoarding bitcoins for precisely the reasons the article points out.
The logical fallacy is this: some people are spending bitcoins therefore people aren't holding onto it. You can't make that jump. There is no evidence to suggest that most people are spending their bitcoins.

To Microsoft's credit, I can buy their OS for less than $130, it works with everything (yes, windows 8 too) and install it on any hardware I want. Mac OS - tied to slower, albeit nicer looking, much more expensive hardware. (I know this isn't what you are saying, but I want to give Microsoft some credit there). Have you ever called Microsoft support? They are extremely professional, you never have to wait, speak english very well, and solve your problem.

Store the bitcoins in the blockchain. Keep the private hashstring in your wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:19:46
Once it actually starts being used (like to buy stuff) it will stabilize, because consumers will be purchasing bitcoins to use, spending them, and retailers will be selling immediately on exchanges through bitpay (you will have a balance of utility buying and automatic selling instead of strictly speculative trading for trading's sake).

The weight of the heatsink can stress the board underneath, and sometimes the thermal bond between the chip underneath it.

Thanks for both of your comments. I agree, it is very difficult to exchange  cash for BTC, with few exceptions. That needs to change. I don't see that changing easily. It's a business opportunity, so hopefully free markets will prevail for the greater good here.
Good APP integration would probably go a long way, but there's still the issue of 3rd party trust and/or doing your own backups. Banking is easy because you know you are insured. There is no bitcoin insurance. 
I suppose the mainstream test in my mind is, "Could my parents comfortably acquire, use, or invest in bitcoins?" The short answer is no.   No matter how "hot" the market might be right now, there are fundamental usability/security issues that outweigh all benefits.

For many people the point is to get in early on something to make money by selling it later. But that might change. The concept of decentralized currency still has value, and the implementation is elegant, but "making the world a better place" is about fixing the financial messes not transitioning to a new speculative vehicle that benefits the few and has unintended consequences for those that, say, work hard and don't read reddit.

I think it's simpler than that. 
1. Transfer funds from your bank account to low priced exchange.
2. Buy bitcoins on low priced exchange and send them to your wallet in the high priced exchange. 
3. Sell the bitcoins on the high priced exchange and put the money in your bank account. 
4. Repeat. 
I think the challenge is mostly that it feels like a hassle.

Understand the variables in the calculator before you use it. Recognize that you will probably first need bitcoins to buy the hardware. The hash difficulty will be higher by the time your equipment arrives, and do not assume that your equipment will arrive next week.

I'm trying to stretch your brain. You wrote "What is the best place to store you bitcoins?" Bitcoins only exist in the blockchain. You store a private key (hashstring) for each public address. This allows you to spend the bitcoins associated with a particular public address. A "wallet" can take many forms, but it's always a collection of one or more private keys :) So the deeper question is, "Where is the best place to store my private keys?"

Hey hey let's be civil and not sling the cognitive insults :p
Realize that my steps do no require any speed when it comes to withdrawal. The repeat doesn't have to be instantaneous. It would be advantageous but it's not required. 
Once you buy on the low price exchange the transfer of bitcoins is almost immediate. The sell at the higher price is almost immediate. At that point, yes, you wait for the money to go to your account, but that does not prevent arbitrage.

Okay, maybe 100% volatile is hyperbole, but the fact is, most people are excited for Bitcoin because they want to buy it, hold it, and sell it later. As a medium of exchange it has value yes, but merchants are accepting it in part for the novelty. If you were running a business with normal margins, you would be gambling your viability with such a volatile currency. The point is, while some are starting to accept it now, that can change if it stays this volatile.

I think that there's a massive amount of static friction to get a lot of these crypto-currencies rolling. Many of them are just re-parameterized bitcoin source. If you want a store of wealth, I don't think that a digital currency is the way to go, long term. For transactions, there's definitely going to be a "winner take all" at some point. Merchants have to want to accept it, and they're only going to want to deal with so many flavours, otherwise business is impossible to run. They need price stability. Many of the merchants accepting payment in bitcoin are probably gambling for a higher price, or doing it for the publicity. Don't get me wrong, I'm still positive for the future and what these things can bring, but there's a lot to be weary of.

Do some basic fact checking. JP Morgan has a lot of assets under their control, yes, but it's not $26 trillion. It's $2.6 trillion. Source: 
About $2.3 trillion of that is funded by debt. They are highly leveraged.
Financial comprehension is important. Publicly-traded companies are more transparent than people think. It takes all of 2 seconds to see their financials. Sorry, this just frustrates me. It's like all those rumours you read about "Company X pays no income tax." No, just look at the financials.

The key to Bitcoin arbitrage is that this is achieved by transferring bitcoins, not money, directly between exchanges. 
Last week I saw several times where Bitstamp was 1050, mt gox 1200, and quite hilariously in canada on Cavirtex 900 (even though CAD is worth less than USD). The arbitrage to Cavirtex wouldn't be feasible though because you need to have a Canadian address. 
I don't think funds are doing this, no, but that's not because it isn't feasible.

BTC transfers faster than a $100 swing on the exchange, and you aren't forced to execute the sale immediately. If somebody was going to buy bitcoins anyways they face literally no risk. 
This is an obvious play, it's just more work than most people are willing to go through. This is done in financial markets all the time. It's what separates ETFs from mutual funds.

Interesting. I've honestly never heard of "assets under custody" before, so I assumed you meant "control". From my quick research, it looks like "assets under custody" refer to assets that other firms and individuals put in trust (held in safekeeping) under JP Morgan. JPM doesn't control it, and it isn't owned by JPM shareholders. So you didn't say anything incorrect. But most people will interpret your statement as "JPM controls 26 trillion in assets", which is wrong (not what you said).

There are a lot of gold miners right now, and the stock market is valuing them at the amount of cash they hold, because the market can be completely irrational, which is the point I'm trying to make. I'll add some links later. You will be amazed. If you think gold has a future, miners are highly leveraged to the price of gold right now.

I think the really funny thing is that despite all of this media coverage that makes it seem quite mainstream, it's still a huge hassle for the average person to obtain. If bitcoins were easy to come by, then yes, I would say we are going mainstream. Hopefully the media coverage doesn't putter out before that happens. Unfortunately the infrastructure is lagging behind the media coverage.

I think the point I'm trying to make here, is that you can't just buy equipment even if you have the money.

Bitcoin as it exists today will NEVER replace fiat, credit, or debit and for good reason. Those things are far more user friendly. Credit and debit aren't as horrible as everyone makes them out to be.

I don't think you understand my point. Let me rephrase it. I would not recommend investing in any asset that that has such a fragile level of confidence. If you honestly think that the price will implode because people get "spooked" by a few articles (whether they are true or not), then you probably shouldn't be investing in bitcoin. If Bitcoin is valued by sentiment and not the value of its protocol, then by suggesting that people "band together to fight off the trolls" you're just trying to build an iron dome around a bubble my friend, and I can assure you that you will not succeed.
If you want a course of action, look to educate people about what Bitcoin IS. I'll give you an example of a similar asset where confidence is easily shaken: gold. And this year proves it. Most people do not understand gold, just as they don't understand Bitcoin. It's a fragile asset from that perspective. People can cry "manipulation" (true or not) all they want, and nothing will change until people understand it. 
The price is dropping because people made 3000% this year. They are selling for that reason. I would too.
Don't feed the conspiracy monster. People will associate Bitcoin with the lunatic fringe, and in my opinion, that's exactly what these conspiracy posts are doing.

Don't get me wrong, I like your post, and your take. I agree with a lot of it. Gold is not transaction friendly by any stretch. Bitcoin wins there. But as a store of wealth, gold is fool-proof. It's a lot easier to account for. Can you imagine central banks storing their bitcoins on a paper wallet in a vault? 
Too risky. Gold is an element that is scarce and never tarnishes. That's not going to change when it comes to a rare, divisible store of wealth.

I suspect that bitcoin is going to get a lot of geeks into gold and silver. Those supplies are also very limited. They are durable, and un-hackable. For those that seek "rare, divisible" (you can't fake an element!) unit of account, gold and silver have held those roles for a very, very long time, and costs of production (like bitcoin mining) are going way up. The difference is that these are physical metals, and at all time lows. You don't have to back them up either. Whatever happens to bitcoin, it's got geeks thinking about money and value, and to me, that's the most important thing!

Under 18 means save for school. And if someone under 18 had money to invest, Bitcoin is the last thing you should be investing in. Read books on economics, finance, learn to read a balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. In not against learning how to manage finances.

1. People need to be able to buy bitcoins without meeting an anonymous stranger or giving all of their personal details.
2. Big retailers and companies need to accept Bitcoin. 
3. Bitcoin wallets/storage/sending payments need to be much more user friendly. I think web-based wallets are getting there.
This has to happen. Will it happen? I don't know. If it does, I'm sure it will happen faster than anybody could imagine.

First no disrespect to you personally. I've read a lot of books on this. "Co-operative ownership" is a Marxist, pie in the sky pipe dream. Every instance of applied "socialism" is communism. That's a planned economy, and planned economies are bad for everybody but those in charge. Look up "planned economy" and you will see socialism. A free market is the opposite. And that's the analogy here.
Wikipedia calls a planned economy a "subset" of socialism. Which is a joke. It's the only form of applied socialism. Source: history.

You're on the right track, but as the other poster indicated, it sounds like you're putting all of your eggs in one basket. Invest in a diversified mutual fund too. Unfortunately, losing even 3 years of savings at the start of your career can have a huge impact on what you will have when you retire. Trust me, I know, and many accountants will tell you the same thing. Many people are worse off BECAUSE they gambled everything young, which runs counter to the "young and can 'afford' to lose" mantra.

Brace for down votes. 
Objective fact: this money printing is actually OFFSETTING the deflation that would otherwise occur after the subprime meltdown. When those junk mortgage assets were revealed to be worthless, quantitative easing was actually intended to replace those worthless assets with cash on banks' balance sheets, so "we can pretend this thing never happened." Get it? That's what they mean by "easing". Result: overall money supply doesn't change. Stability for all. Banks get a free pass to go AND collect trillions of dollars. It's not good, no. I don't particularly like it. But this is WHY they are printing the 85B. To OFFSET DEFLATION. Now you know! And knowing is good.
For banks, businesses, investors, and especially the government, deflation=bad. QE bad, deflation=more bad.

It's heavily dependent on how quickly the difficulty increases though. That appears to be the key variable, more influential than $BTC. If difficulty increases 70% monthly (what we're seeing now), then I'd make back my money and then some at $1000 BTC. We'll see what happens.

If you're afraid of the naysayers that means there's good reason. People say "short sellers push prices down". That's not true.

If bitcoin went mainstream, it would be unfair to most hardworking people. They've been working and saving, in dollars, and they deserve what they've saved. 
Unfortunately, most bitcoin advocates don't care, it's about "I've got mine, screw what happens to everybody else." 
A stronger dollar is better for everybody. If bitcoin went mainstream, think of people that haven't joined the bandwagon. Think of your friends, your parents. It wouldn't be fair to them. 
But this discussion is moot. Bitcoin has value, but it's never going mainstream. It's too complicated, and debit/credit are nowhere near as "evil" as most people suggest. Merchants pay most of the fees, and you're insured.

Yes, it's terrible. Many Bitcoin hoarders proclaim "if you don't have all your money in Bitcoin it's as good as gone" with zero apparent concern for the average hardworking person that earns and saves in the dollar. It's like they want not only Bitcoin to succeed, but the dollar to fail so that they will be the new "elite" without having produced anything really. All of this under the "Bitcoin is for the people thing". It doesn't have to be that way. Bitcoin can provide utility, but you should never want it to at the expense of the dollar. That would just be horrible for too many people.

The arbitrage is complete once you are done selling. Then your profit would be in the mt gox account. Arbitrage means buying low on one exchange and selling on a high priced one. You guys actually think the Bitcoin market is efficient? Its not. People do this kind of thing all the time. This is how markets become efficient. Through arbitrage. This is actually why ETFs are good financial vehicles; because big players are constantly able to take advantage of arbitrage. They profit, and the ETF price closely tracks the underlying holdings. I'm a finance guy.. I'm surprised you guys can disagree so much. I'm hearing it is impossible to withdraw money from mt gox ever? I didn't know that. That seems unlikely.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:07:52
I agree. It's definitely in a speculative rut right now. I'd ballpark that at least 95% of everyone who owns bitcoins purchased them to hold them, on the hope to sell them for more in the future if and when it "really catches on". To the credit of the early adopters, that's exactly what happened, but with a $12 billion dollar valuation, it's going to take something more. 
I really, really like the idea of a non-inflating medium of exchange. But with that, comes hoarding. The internet, we are weak. Welcome to the religion of bitcoinology.

The huge ups and downs challenge its viability as a medium of exchange. A medium of exchange needs stability. Optimism encourages hoarding, and pessimism drives selling, and these swings are HUGE for a $15 billion market. Absolutely massive. 
It's interesting that where many (like myself) would have expected stability in a fixed supply, the reality is much, much different.

You are assuming that past performance (with bitcoin) is indicative of future results. This could very well be the top. A $15 billion dollar market driven largely by hoarding and hype should be eyed with a lot of caution. This could easily go down to $30 and stay there. Anybody who invests in financial markets knows this. Buy and hold is only appropriate in some cases, usually when you are diversified in an entire market. This is a single currency, and the most volatile one to boot. Once the ability to short Bitcoin becomes more common, you can expect much lower prices. Bitcoin is especially risky here, because people don't know how to value it. Psychologically the shorts will have the upper hand. People won't buy into their selling.

Long term, I do believe that this is the Achilles heal of Bitcoin as a currency. But at the present time there are for more challenging short term hurdles. I would not dismiss this article entirely.

I'm getting a better deal than anybody who bought a Jalapeno. I also suspect that it's in BFL's interest to support their first generation cloud mining customers. It seems like the most viable business model going forwards, because the cost per miner is going to become very VERY high. This lets them sell fractions of mining power, for which there is a much broader market (more people willing to spend $200 than $20k).

I think you aren't getting what I'm saying. I understand capitalism. Capitalism favors equality of process over equality of outcome; two mutually exclusive concepts. Buying and holding bitcoins doesn't contribute anything. It doesn't create any value for anybody. 
I don't understand why you put "hardworking people" in quotations. 
See this is the really bad attitude (I don't want to single you out) that Bitcoin advocates share: "I got mine, this is the future, screw everybody else".

Yep. Even though people talk about "private key"/"public key" hashes and all of this stuff like it's some root layer that they understand, everybody who sends and receives bitcoins is either using a PC client or 3rd party web-based wallet or wallet generator. There's a level of trust there. There's no reason why we won't then see more user-friendly clients that, while more "removed" from the protocol, aren't just as safe for the average user.

Last week there was a $50 - $150 spread between market price on mt gox and Bitstamp for days.

Sorry for your unconfirmed loss..

Between Bitcoin succeeding and global chaos I for one would rather Bitcoin fails. Let's hope it's not so black and white.
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:13:44
This is funny because right now "the few" are in fact hoarding bitcoins at the expense of "mankind" because they fail to realize that most people would suffer if the dollar collapsed. Stop being greedy under the banner of "for the people".
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:44:13
Yes, most transactions cost about 10 cents sadly if you want it to get there within an hour.

Haha.. yea.. again no disrespect to you and I can see we are arguing semantics. Read "a conflict of visions" by Sowell. Many words have become so warped that everybody can adopt them. You have to admit though, the Wikipedia entry for socialism (and many many other political and economic philosophies) is so generic ton the point of being useless and an obvious source of confusion.
Chomsky calls himself a "libertarian socialist". Really? "The media in controlling you". Try reading the Wikipedia entry for that and not laughing.
Guh.. 
Have a nice day!
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:10:57
Yep, as soon as we head to $10
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:25:34
Basic Economics by Thomas Sowell. It's unbiased, and highly recommended.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:15:44
It means that merchants are starting to accept payment, but if bitcoin is completely volatile, no merchant is going to accept it. That makes its transactional value highly speculative. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:28:06
I would wait. If you already have some, and it goes way up, you will be well rewarded without taking on more risk (aka don't be too greedy). 
The benefit to this is that if the price does drop to $100 (I think this is very possible), you will get a much better deal with the same money and feel better about it. 
I have less than 1 BTC and that's plenty if it goes to "40k". If it drops to 100 I'll quadruple it. If it doesn't go there, no big deal.
Bitcoin is risky. Keep some powder dry. Know when to restrain yourself. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:19:45
Yep I've decided to not buy based on this.

I use bitcoin-qt on my windows 8 machine without problem.

If bitcoin takes off at the expense of the dollar (a lot of idiots think the dollar should be destroyed), millions of hard working people would see a significant decrease in their purchasing power. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:29:51
Two words: fire hazard
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:54:01
You mean speculate* in the future of bitcoin. Don't confuse buying bitcoins with investing!
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:03:52
I don't mean bid/ask spread. I mean market
 price between the two exchanges :p sorry
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:34:09
Ya, the next headlines could be "I was a Bitcoin millionaire-Aaaaand it's gone"
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:05:30
Bitcoin is brilliant, but it also has many flaws, and it's being idolized like it's the path to some utopian world, which is far from true.
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:10:32
This is definitely fake. You haven't posted the "user" that did it.
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:26:35
Yes, let's censor the Internet. Everybody put on your tin foil hats. The price is going down, therefore it's being manipulated. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 21:13:36
Ah now you're gonna get all the weirdo tenants (I say this half-jokingly). 
@_date: 2013-12-28 05:09:58
Yes, I will laugh. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 20:45:13
I don't think so
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:53:05
Well you do still need to comply with local laws. Bitcoin is just a medium of exchange. Don't idolize it!
@_date: 2013-12-21 15:14:16
It's funny how this article refers to the Internet "as a mess" "there was no google" in 1995. To the contrary, the Internet was more of a fact and knowledge based platform devoid of much of the useless and time consuming social media. No Facebook yay. No twitter yay. No YouTube. No circlejerking. The internet was a tool. A useful platform. Now it's a distraction. A place where crazy likes to live.
@_date: 2013-12-17 13:59:10
Yes there are risks, absolutely, and unintended consequences surely.
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:05:39
On a $50 pizza maybe

Check out Cavirtex and their debit card that links to a Bitcoin exchange account.

Sounds a lot like money laundering.

Very few people were using email in '94. The internet wasn't really mainstream until '96. I remember paying "by the hour" of useage, and you couldn't use the phone at the same time. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:31:16
Alright. Clearly you have credibility here since you live there. I'll give you that. When I visited as a "tourist" there seemed to be a lot of dutch in these "shops" (I have nothing against the dutch!) surely not only tourists hang out downtown :p
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:12:25
I missed it because I was on reddit... :(
@_date: 2013-12-28 21:49:23
Sounds like somebody needs to go to jelly school.
