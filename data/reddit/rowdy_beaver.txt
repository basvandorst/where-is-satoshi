Bring certainty to the market by stating clearly the roadmap so everyone can plan around it.  Not stating a decision is doing harm to the ecosystem.  
I have stopped recommending bitcoin to friends simply because I no longer have confidence it is sustainable for individuals and for the unbanked.  If it is not going to enable growth, it will not last and people and businesses will look for another solution.
There are a significant number of industries that are considering bitcoin, but this debate is pushing them to look for other alternatives.  They are not going to sit on the sidelines very long.  Many threads are about companies looking at blockchain technology, and the comments in each of them profess that the bitcoin blockchain is the most secure/best/only.

Your wallet program should suggest a fee (Mycelium provides several levels, based on how fast you need the transaction to confirm).  The specific wallet program may calculate a fee automatically (Electrum), although you can override this on the preferences for the wallet.
Bitcoin Core and other wallets can suggest the fee amount, based on the priority you need for your transaction, and this is based on actual transactions and confirmed blocks over a period of time.
Right now Mycelium indicates $0.11 USD (0.000259 BTC) for top priority and $0.01 USD (0.000015 BTC) for low priority.
When you add a fee to your transaction, it gets deducted from your wallet balance in the same bitcoin transaction that pays the merchant.  Basically, if you want to buy an item for $5.00 and pay a fee of $0.05, your wallet is spending a total of $5.05.

I was visiting Bitcoin Boulevard in Cleveland a month ago and visited one of the merchants.  I was in line behind a woman trying to pay with a credit card.  Somehow, she kept hitting the Cancel button on the pad.  They re-scanned her card again.  When she was done, I asked if the cashier could ring up a Bitcoin transaction. "Sure!". The other customer turned and asked me about bitcoin.  When the cashier rang up my order and displayed the QR code, I just took a picture of it with my phone. "Done" said the cashier.  The woman was amazed.  We discussed Bitcoin while waiting for our food.  She was definitely interested as it was easier than her credit card transaction.  She noted that I didn't need to hand anything to the cashier or sign the display.  I explained how my identity and credentials stay with me on my phone and don't leave my device.  She is a convert.
Check out the story on Reddit of the person visiting a bar in France that accepted bitcoin.  He wrote about it on Facebook and a friend back home told him to send a picture of the QR code.  His drink was paid for by a friend in Miami.  Can your credit card do that? Will a merchant even let you pay with a credit card over the phone? From another country?

There are checksums to ensure the address is not easily mistyped.  I have heard of people finding an old address they deposited to, not realizing it was for someone else, or simply losing the private key ("I moved all my coins from wallet X, so I can delete the wallet, right?"), or never ensuring they had the private key for that address.
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:20:22
Not at all. Depending on the wallet program (Bitcoin-QT/d, Multibit) backups are needed when new receiving addresses are created because the keys are completely random. Other wallets (Electrum, Armory) base their keys in a deterministic way, so just having the single original backup (or writing down the phrases) will provide 'parentage' for other keys generated from that wallet.  Importing private keys into a deterministic program will require a fresh backup.
Check with your wallet program's instructions for specific details.

Your Bitcoin wallet (any wallet program) stores the private key and public address.  The balance is tracked and stored on the globally distributed blockchain.  As long as the program can find the public address on the blockchain, the balance is known.

Don't look now... it's already happening.
We're already seeing merchant adoption rising at exponential rates, per Coinbase, BitPay, and other applications that track places to spend digital currency.
Lee Rd in Cleveland OH is branding itself as Bitcoin Blvd USA as they will have at least 8 merchants accepting coins as of May 1.
I was in Austin TX in March and there are quite a few food vendors accepting bitcoin.  University areas throughout the country are starting to accept bitcoin.
Personally, I try to pay in cash because I don't always trust merchants not to double-swipe my card.  I try to only use reputable sites online because I don't know what they are going to do with my credit card data.  I rarely give donations online because I don't want to provide name/address/phone/card/ccv/etc just for a $5 donation.  I would feel safer using Bitcoin than cash or credit cards.
If I am listening to a band, I would rather scan a QR and send some bitcoin their way than try to look like a jerk and ask for change for a $20 bill.  If I am listening at home or via the Internet, I will gladly scan a QR code on the screen or on their website than trust them with my credit card details.
The 1% exchange rate, if it even applies, is generally less than the fees at an ATM.  Merchants don't necessarily have to convert back to fiat, and as their supply chain gets more efficient because of bitcoin, it won't have to.
Imagine buying a jacket at a store and paying with Bitcoin. It would be trivial to configure the point-of-sale system, or backend, to split the transaction so the merchant gets his percentage and his supplier gets their payment almost immediately, seamlessly, and for a few cents in fees.
I have lots of confidence in today's geeks (and tomorrow's) for solving the growing pains.  In 1990, no one would have ever expected YouTube, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, and Gmail.  We're just in the earliest stages of this technology.

It might be possible to do it using bitcoin multisig where you need 2 of 2 signatures (one being yours), but this means that they will have bitcoin and it may turn customers off if they can't spend the bitcoin anywhere they want.
I suppose you can create your own altcoin ( and run your exclusive mining computers yourself to do the transaction validation.  Some custom wallets and point-of-sale devices might be needed, though (maybe worth checking into).

MIght be a good idea to also provide some instructions (or a website with them) that explains step by step how to use them and play around with sending even smaller transactions around, just to get comfortable with the process. Then include instructions for methods of buying more through some other service. Point them to to get any questions answered.  It feels more authentic if you point them to somewhere else to get more (it makes it obvious it isn't a scam).

Paper wallets are recommended for long-term storage.  Think of this as your 401K.  You can generate the public address/private key by booting from a Linux desktop install CD (aka live CD) then navigating to  then disconnect the internet access (all of this site runs in javascript in the browser and does not need external internet).  Move the mouse and when it shows tabs, use the Paper Wallet tab. Use BIP38 and supply a passphrase so it encrypts the private key to help prevent someone from finding the paper and accessing the bitcoin. You can print out a number of these paper wallets at one time (with or without art).  Send coins to the public address whenever you have more coins that you want in cold storage.
Secure occasional spending: Electrum lets you have an offline copy with your private keys (perhaps on a Raspberry Pi).  An online copy of Electrum can have a 'watch only' wallet, with the public address but not the private keys. You can keep this online safely. When you need to spend these coins, create the transaction on the online Electrum, then use a USB stick to copy the file to the offline Electrum. Use you private key to sign the transaction, then transfer it back and transmit it to the network.  This is very secure.  Never connect the offline computer to the Internet.  It works nicely.
For your daily spending, use a wallet on a smartphone. Mycelium is excellent.  It also lets you spend from a paper wallet (best practice is to move the entire balance off that paper wallet at one time and don't reuse it once you have spent from it since the signing key has hit the Internet... not that this is currently a risk, but it is a safety thing).
Hope that helps! Ask questions if you have them.

Don't forget that Bitcoin is a 'push' protocol versus credit cards being a 'pull'.  This means that a merchant needs all of your identifying information in order to charge your credit card.  This same information can be used repeatedly or stolen from the merchant (110 million Target customers).
Bitcoin is a 'push', where the consumer has to initiate the transfer of funds, by unlocking their private key.  The vendor only ever sees the customer's public address, which is not enough to do any good if stolen or misused.  Much safer for the consumer.

It is a matter of good wallet hygiene.  Since paper wallets are often used for secure offline storage (where they private key has never been seen by another computer), they are considered very safe for large amounts of bitcoin.
When you send some of the bitcoin from a paper wallet, your private key signs the transaction. While this does not expose the private key to the network (but it IS exposed to your wallet program, which might be compromised), the public key (another piece of the wallet) is used.  Even though it is not currently possible to work backwards from a public address to a public key to a private key, it is simply a safety precaution that you only spend from the paper wallet once.  If someday, someone figures out how to reverse engineer the private key, you would want to have your long-term storage keys never accessed on a computer.  If you only keep a small amount on the paper wallet for convenience, then it may not be a huge concern for you.  One idea is to keep a small stash of bitcoin on an encrypted BIP38 private key on paper in your wallet so you can easily recharge your smartphone wallet when away from home.
This also helps with anonymity, as the transaction to spend a small portion of the paper wallet will return the 'spare change' to that wallet (paper or not), the use of a fresh address for this 'spare change' helps hide which transaction output was to a payee and which was change.
If your are in front of me at the grocery store and use a $100 bill to buy a $2 beverage, I know that you have $98 in change in your pocket.  By using change addresses, rather than returning the change to the original address, I can't easily determine from the blockchain ledger if you spent $98 for an item or $2.

Ukraine's stance is no different than most countries, which basically state: "Bitcoin is not our country's official currency, so merchants cannot price items only in Bitcoin, and consumers do not get any government protections that they would have if they used our currency. Bitcoin price fluctuates, and consumers should be aware of that before using it."  Common sense.  There is no FDIC insurance, use at your own risk.
It is not a hardened stance prohibiting Bitcoin, simply a reasonable warning. 
While Russia has stronger language, they realize that Bitcoin is peer-to-peer and cannot be stopped, but they are trying to reduce the ability for it to gain wide acceptance.

Armory will say '1 hour' for many hours.  It needs to get a copy of the 30G blockchain and also build its own database on top of that.  This is a downside to Armory and Bitcoin-QT/bitcoind.  You will be able to send bitcoin from the wallet once these updates complete.

I am not a tax accountant, however, the capital gains applies even if you stay completely in Bitcoin.  
Just as in barter, the value for the product/service paid in bitcoin is subject to capital gains.  
For example, if you agree to pay 0.250 BTC for an item, the USD exchange rate at the time of the transaction determines the value. That 0.250 BTC is subject to reporting, even if the item was not priced in USD to begin with.  
So the IRS requirement is that you track the USD value of the bitcoin when they become yours and when they leave your possession (either the specific coins or First-in-First-Out/Last-in-First-Out (FIFO/LIFO) or other accounting method.

As the general public hears more about Bitcoin, and more merchants embrace it, many people will start using it and find it preferable to credit cards.  Bitcoin is today where email was in 1991 (difficult to use), but expect this to improve rapidly.
Unlike even cash, where the merchant needs to worry about employee theft, the point-of-sale only needs to present the customer with the merchant's public address, and the employee would not be able to steal funds.  Like most brick-and-mortar, a manager might have to approve refunds and unlock the private key, or the manager can make some limited bitcoin available for refunds.
Services like BitPay and Coinbase take all of the risk from the merchant, as they remove the price volatility.  They both offer online and point of sale options.  This means that an item that sells for $100 USD will be presented to the customer in the bitcoin exchange rate at that moment. The BitPay/Coinbase service will deposit the $100 USD in the merchant's account (or the merchant can keep any portion in bitcoin).  This is true even if the exchange rate changes.
Chargebacks (where a customer tells Visa that they merchant did not deliver the goods) are not possible in Bitcoin, although some services are starting to offer escrow services to mediate transactions when needed (for a fee that is only charged if mediation is used).  Chargebacks are a significant risk for merchants in that the customer has left the store with the merchandise and the payment is reversed, so the merchant is also out the sale price.
Processing fees are 3-5% for credit cards.  Coinbase merchants get $1 million in fee-free transactions. BitPay has another method (I think flat-rate based on the monthly amount of sales, but as low as 0.1%).
Bitcoin is a 'push' technology, where the customer unlocks their private key and sends the payment to the merchant. Credit cards are 'pull', where the merchant has to have all of the details necessary to request payment.  These same credit card details can be stolen or misused (ask Target's 110 million customers).  Again, charge-backs come into play, putting the merchant at risk. With Bitcoin, the merchant only sees the public address for the customer, and this is (as the name implies) public and does not put the customer at risk.
I heard rumor that the Coinbase shopping cart API is the same as PayPal's (at least for some shopping cart apps), so there might be almost no application development cost to add a Bitcoin option.
Point-of-sale integration for brick-and-mortar stores is actively in development, so that will make things easier.

The credit card agreements strictly prohibit merchants from checking id and putting the customer through additional rigor (some merchants do check id, despite the rules).  They put the merchant in a no-win situation, since so many customer still use credit cards.
Larger merchants that keep credit card data on file need lots of extra procedures to try to secure that data.  Even then, we still get large data breaches.
The sooner credit cards go away the better it will be for our economy.  Merchants will save and consumers will not have to scan their statements each month to see if they lost the lottery.
The only fraud that will still exist is when a merchant doesn't provide the promised goods or service, that multisig can help with most of those situations.

No, that's it. If the private key is loaded into a wallet program, the Bitcoin can be spent.  Since the public addresses represent an account, and the account balance is stored in the blockchain, you don't need to load it into a wallet to be able to receive coins, only spend them.
Some wallet programs support 'watch-only' addresses, where you can load the public address into the wallet program and it will report on the balance.  However, without the private key you cannot spend them.

Many small merchants will refund cc purchases but only give in-store credit for cash.  I would assume this would work the same way with bitcoin.
As Overstock said on CNN, when their suppliers start accepting bitcoin, it will make sense for them to hold onto some of the bitcoin coming in.

IANAL... This depends on the way he handles the bitcoin.  In either case, he still owes sales taxes on the merchandise.
If he holds onto the bitcoin, rather than converting it all to cash, then he would also have to report capital gains/losses when he spends the bitcoin (what was the value of the coins when they were obtained less the value of the coins when they were sold/spent).
If he uses BitPay/Coinbase as a bitcoin payment processor and has them convert 100% of the bitcoin to cash, then he has no capital gains/losses to report (the purchase and sale value where the same).
That is my understanding of the IRS ruling.
With that understood, he still benefits from using bitcoin since he saves 2-5% over credit cards and is not at risk for charge-backs.  If he is able to pay his suppliers in bitcoin, they can also save 2-5% (since many suppliers get paid with credit cards), so the suppliers may be able to offer discounts. Since he would be holding on to some of the bitcoin, the gain/loss rules apply.
Have him talk to his tax accountant.  Please post corrections, if any.

The receiving party creates a bitcoin wallet, which has a public address and a private key.  The public address is akin to an account number.  The sender must know the receiver's public address in order to send bitcoin to them, just like an email sender must know the recipients email address.  However, in order to send bitcoin from your 'account', you must use the private key.  The sender (and receiver) keep their private keys secure and never share them.  Anyone who has the private key can spend from the account, so it needs to be kept secure.
So, to send bitcoin of any amount, the recipient shares their key.  The sender indicates the amount they want to send and enters the passphrase to unlock their private key to sign the transaction. The transaction is sent to the Bitcoin network.  The network validates the signature and records in a ledger that value was sent to the recipient.  However, unlike banks, there is no middleman taking a percentage of the transaction (there is a fee, but it is currenty about $0.04 regardless of the amount being sent).  Also, there is no middleman to say who you can and cannot pay.  Transactions are nearly instant and final.  If the recipient wants to convert to their local currency, there are services (exchanges) that perform that function, usually for a fee.  But if there is no need to convert from bitcoin, they stay in the recipients account until they unlock them with their private key and send them to someone else (or to another public address they own).
Unlike credit cards, the recipient cannot pull money from the sender.  Bitcoin is 'push' technology, like cash, where the sender is always in control.  Since no private account information is given to the recipient (or anyone else), there is no information to steal from the recipient (unlike credit cards).  The sender must keep their private key secure, so the responsibility for security moves to the bitcoin user.
Where a bank is a central set of computers that hold everyone's private account information, they become an attractive target for thieves: Break in to one computer and get millions of accounts.  With bitcoin, since each user maintains their own account on their own devices (there are many ways to keep these secure), and if a thief breaks into a device, they only get the account on that device, and only if they are able to get to the private key.
Since Bitcoin is 'programmable money', there are many other possibilities such as multisignature transactions (more than one private key must sign the transaction), and escrow where the arbiter does not have any access to the funds.  Many possibilities that cannot be done with cash/credit.
TLDR; Bitcoin is sent much like email, so bitcoins are sent to the recipients address.

Use HD (heirarchical deterministic) wallets like Electrum and others that implement the BIP32 standard.  They generate new addresses automatically from a single seed and will direct change from a transaction to a new address in your wallet automatically.  This reduces address reuse and encourages better anonymity.  The bitcoin is still in a single wallet so you don't have to switch from one wallet to another to take advantage of these capabilities.
I know that Mycelium (currently in testing) will be moving towards HD wallets in the next release.  The test version looks great so far.

Good point! This could be phased in over a few years. First year, 3/4 of the tax dollars would *not* be delegated by taxpayers and fund 3/4 of each agency's prior year budget, and they might get more from the 1/4 of taxpayer-delegated funds. This would give some continuity and would let everyone see what programs the general public is willing to support.  The next year, half of the tax debt would be fixed and half based on delegations.  This would give time to phase out unpopular programs.  After that point, it is pure taxpayer delegated funding.
Just a concept, not something I would base a career in politics on.  Hopefully someone could build on this and work on the problems.
This gives incentive for the programs to act responsibly and get more efficient.  If they are reckless with the funds or doing unpopular things, the taxpayers will withdraw support.  Taxation with true representation.

This is like saying "No one needs the Internet because no one needs to send email".  Peer-to-peer payments are just the first application written for Bitcoin, just as email was the first application for the Internet. It was many years after email before we got the first web page.
We are very close to making multisig transactions somewhat accessible.  Cash and credit can't do escrow without requiring that one party maintains control of the funds and is trusted.  Bitcoin can remove that trust requirement and can prevent one party from running off with all the funds.  This is the second application that enables many possibilities.

You calculate based on the difference of the value of the bitcoin at purchase price and the value at the time of sale.  
Rather than use $5/$10, let's use some other numbers to illustrate:  You buy $5 of bitcoin at $100/coin (you purchase 0.05BTC).  When you buy a $3 cup of coffee when the price of bitcoin is now $600/coin, you spend 0.005BTC.  The gain/loss is calculated as original value of the bitcoin versus the value at the time of sale.  So, your 0.005BTC spent of coffee was originally valued at $0.50 and is now valued at $3.00, so the realized gain/loss is $3.00 (value now) - $0.50 (value at purchase time), so you pay tax on $2.50 in realized gains (the increase in value of those bitcoins from when they were bought versus sold).  You still have 0.045BTC in your wallet and you don't need to pay taxes on that amount until it is spent.
The forumula stays the same, but it gets a little more complicated as you buy/spend more bitcoin.
Say you also buy $60 of bitcoin at $600/bitcoin, you will add 0.10BTC to your account balance (bringing your total balance to 0.145BTC).  We need to track the bitcoin from each purchase separately.
Now, if you buy $45 item when then bitcoin price is $750/bitcoin, you will be spending 0.06BTC.  Accounting-wise, you would be using the remainder of the first group of coins, 0.045BTC that were purchased at $100/bitcoin, and 0.015BTC of those purchased at $600/bitcoin.  So your gain/loss is calculated at (0.045BTC x ($750 - $100)) + (0.015BTC x ($750 - $600)), or $29.25+$2.25, meaning you pay tax on $31.50 of capital gains.  You still have 0.085BTC in your wallet.
These are basically the rules the IRS has been using all along.  By the way, the tax rate will vary based on how long you have owned each purchase group of bitcoins, as those held for a short time (&lt;6 months) is taxed at a different rate from long-term holdings.
Ask questions if you have them!

Merchant risk is reduced, not only from charge fees and chargebacks, but also the merchant can be positive his employees are not skimming from him.  As the cashiers only present the public key to accept payment, the merchant can maintain control over the private keys.  No more stealing from the cash drawer.
As more suppliers start accepting bitcoin for the instantaneous remittance without crazy fees and delays, the efficiency of the bitcoin payment system really begins to shine.
Perhaps one day, as I pay for an item, the grocer gets his cut and the supplier automatically gets their cut of the transaction. Commission might be paid directly to the employee and everyone is happy and there is much less paperwork.

You are skipping a few big differences between credit and bitcoin.  
   1) Credit is 'pull', so you hand over your credentials to the seller so they can request payment from the processor.  This makes fraud much easier and makes the consumer less safe, increases the processor's costs, which are passed on to each and every consumer.  With bitcoin, the consumer retains contol of their credentials at all times.  Less opportunity for fraud.
  2) Remaining consumer protections would be for cases of a merchant scamming a customer.  Multi-sig and escrow can provide consumer protections when dealing with an untrusted merchant.  Part of every charge card transaction pays for this arbitration.  With bitcoin, the arbiter doesn't need to be paid unless needed.

Since the user is in control of the private keys, they would have to deliberately attempt a double-spend. The underlying Bitcoin protocol doesn't track your balance as much as it tracks unspent transactions that your private key can unlock.  A double spend is using the same unspent transaction output on two different transactions.
To accomplish this, the scammers wallet needs to send the two transactions to different sets peers (full nodes).  If the same peer sees both, they will reject the second one they receive.  The user then has to hope the miner than wins the confirmation process picks their bogus spend instead of the one to a merchant.  Also, these transactions have to hit the Bitcoin network within a short time window (less than 10 minutes).
Only one of the two transactions will ever get confirmed, and the user cannot tell which one will get picked up by miners and confirmed.  Scammers prefer a 100% success rate but they only get 50% chance of successfully cheating a merchant with a double-spend.  Therefore it is much effort for a chance of pulling it off.
For small amounts, the merchant can generally not bother waiting for confirmations. For large amounts, they should wait for at least one confirmation.  For very large amounts, they should wait for several confirmations.  Online merchants aren't sending the items out the door immediately, so they have plenty of time to catch this.  In person transactions (where the customer gets the item and leaves) are more at risk, although that risk is still low.

Yes.  The paper wallet (and even an electronic wallet) contains a private key and a public address.  The public address can be shared with anyone, like an email address, so they can send bitcoin to you.  In order to spend bitcoin from that address, you need to use the private key in a wallet program, which will allow it to sign the transactions.
The balance is not tracked by the wallet, but by the public blockchain (the ledger) that makes Bitcoin work. Miners confirm transactions in order to receive a reward (fresh bitcoins and the fees from transactions included in the block).  When you inspect your balance, your wallet program is searching the ledger for any transactions sent to your public address.  That's a high-level view of the process.
@_date: 2014-02-28 10:27:59
This is a very real concern for people who get paid in BTC for their work, as they don't want everyone tracing back their income.
Normal recommended practice is for everyone to use lots of addresses. They are free. Wallet programs like Electrum help by sending change to a new address.
So, when you spend from an address containing 0.1 BTC to buy coffee at .005, the merchant gets the .005 and the 0.095 change goes to a new address in your wallet. This makes it harder for someone to tell which amount was for a purchase and which was the change.  After a few of these, the linkage back to the original address is obscured.
But, if you wanted to buy a TV for 1BTC, that 0.095 might get lumped with other change addresses you own to make up the purchase price. All these separate change addresses will appear as inputs to the larger transaction, thus linking them together that they simply had to have the same owner.
If you use separate transactions to collect this change into a common address first, you can maintain the separation.
With so many addresses being used by everyone all the time, it can require significant guesswork and effort to try to relate things back to an individual.

The mining reward is currently 25 bitcoins and this cuts in half every 4 years (next halving is around 2016).  The idea is that the transaction fees will pick up the slack.
Initially, no one had Bitcoin (or a reason to mine) so the reward was set high.  As the theory goes, more people will start using it, so the transaction fees will replace the mining reward (the miner of the winning block gets these fees).  So, in a world with many Bitcoin transactions per second, the miners would get more transaction fees.
As some miners don't earn enough, they will either invest in better mining equipment or give up. The difficulty will adjust up or down, accordingly.

A few points stand out:
* Bitcoin lets you pay anyone, anywhere, any amount, at any time, instantly.  Show me a QR code and I can send bitcoin to it.  Apple's wallet lets you pay merchants only (maybe they will provide some person-to-person payments).
* Bitcoin does not require a bank account.  Apple Pay does nothing to help those who can't/don't have credit cards or bank accounts.
* Although Apple has the large banks already signed up, there are still many customers with cards at other places and lots of customers without iPhones (and certainly lots more customers without iPhones).  They have lots of infrastructure they need to roll out, too, in order to make this work.
* The merchants I know really like bitcoin's 1% exchange fee over 2-5%.  
* If the brick and mortar stores have to get new POS equipment to accept Apple Pay, they either won't do it or will get a device that will also support bitcoin.

My 2 satoshi's: While failure/obscurity is certainly a possibility, the number of small businesses adopting Bitcoin is growing quickly.  With this comes customers.
Chicken/egg scenario: People will use bitcoin if they have places that can use it, and merchants may not accept it if there aren't people asking for it.
We have to convince the merchants that they can accept it even before the customers ask.  While Coinbase and BitPay reduce/eliminate the risks and volatility for a merchant, it is a slow process to gain adoption.  It will take some momentum for larger merchants to figure it out.
There were many companies without a web presence even in 2005.  Now, it is an essential part of their business.

People often use credit cards so they don't have to carry cash. It also lets them consolidate many payments to various merchants into a single payment at the end of the month. They pay their bill in full each month, so it isn't a matter of needing a short-term loan, it just acts that way.  If they could settle payment immediately, many of them would do so to avoid the monthly payment.
Many people use debit cards because of the immediate settlement (they either have the funds in the bank or they don't). They get the advantage of not carrying cash.  So they don't have a large bill at the end of the month.  Bitcoin handles this case natively.
Others use credit cards for payments they choose to stretch over several months, which is a situation that native Bitcoin does not offer.

Merchants often pay their suppliers using credit cards.  There's another 2-5% off the top of the supplier's profit, on top of the 2-5% the merchant has to include in the price you pay.  Now, that supplier pays suppliers for their raw materials... add another 2-5% overhead.  Just at 3 layers, you, the customer are paying from 6 to 15% more for every item you buy.  There's significant supply chain benefit to using bitcoin.  So that IS a problem for you, the customer.  There was simply no alternative.
If you want to use ApplePay you need Apple's wallet.  If you want to use Google's payment system, you have to use Google Wallet.  If you want to use bitcoin, you have to use a bitcoin wallet but you CHOOSE which wallet you use: Mycelium, Bitcoin Wallet, Coinbase, Electrum, Multibit, Armory, Bitcoin-QT, Hive, Pheeva, ....  No vendor lock-in.
If ApplePay uses credit beneath the covers, you can bet that there is a spending limit.  Why would that magically go away because you can tap instead of swipe?
Go to a country that doesn't use your currency and use your credit card.  They include a hefty fee in the exchange rate if it isn't explicitly called out.  Read the fine print. It's there.
Bitcoin has many advantages that cash/credit can't offer, such as multisig.  Set up your kid's allowance into a multisig address, so he can't spend unless mom or dad also sign the transaction.  You can't do that with cash or credit without a visit to the bank for every transfer.

Canada's government is trying to find out (paraphrasing one senator): "How can we help Bitcoin grow?"  They have already stated that proposed regulations, like New York's BitLicense, is unwieldy and puts a excessive burden on Bitcoin businesses that does not exist for cash or credit.  Canada wants to welcome Bitcoin so banks can learn to work with it.   One of the speaker's comments was along the ines of "I have a Bitcoin business and so (current laws) I cannot get a bank account.

In addition to the other replies already posted, it is important to understand that Bitcoin is the first widely adopted (relatively) way to send any amount of value to anyone, anytime, anywhere, instantly.  Putting the programming tools together to provide this solved many difficult problems (very elegantly).  Now that we know how to do this, there will always be a digital form of currency.  There's no going back.  It may be Bitcoin, or something else may replace it.  The technology is not going away.

There are enough private keys so every atom on the planet could have one, and there would still be many more left.  Since the public address is calculated from the private key, using a few one-way hash functions, even figuring out how to break (reverse engineer) one of the hash functions leaves you with another (different) hash function to conquer.

Which wallet program are you using? That may help us answer your questions more appropriately.
Think about how many transactions you want to do in a 15 minute period (planning on &gt;10 minute confirmation), and the amount of each transaction. Don't get too carried away with this. Transaction fees are based on the size of the transaction (typically 1-4 inputs and 2 outputs, which has a fee of about .1 mBTC).  You may get more for that same fee.
If you plan to make these rapid transactions often, it may be worth it to you.  However, if you have $100 in your wallet, all as $1 outputs, if you make a $50 purchase, there will be 50 inputs, thus a larger transaction and larger fee.
Most wallets let you have multiple addresses.  Some wallet programs can treat each address separately (one transaction only spends from one address), and some treat them as a whole (one transaction might spend from several of your addresses), and some wallets let you 'freeze' some addresses so a transaction won't spend from it.

The problem has been laziness.  It costs a few dollars to fix things, and the priority has been extracting fees from customers instead of improvements.  Even if they would benefit, they just don't want to invest and innovate.  The US still does not have chips in the credit cards (or certainly not widely used).  They say it costs too much.

Imagine you run a store that sells merchandise and also gift cards.  If I pay for a gift card, you have the $250.  When I redeem the gift card for merchandise, your balance is an even zero.  Now, I tell the credit card company that I didn't buy that gift card and they reverse the charges.  You, the merchant, have to refund the $250 and you are also out the $250 in the merchandise that was paid for with the gift card.  You are out a total of $500.
It may also be a gift card for another merchant (we'll call them "Mike's Merchandise").  Somewhere along the line you have to send a portion of that $250 gift card purchase to Mike's Merchandise.  When the gift card is redeemed at Mike's, he doesn't care because he already got his money from you.  When the charges are reversed, you are out the $250.  Mike doesn't have to pay you back (it wasn't his business that accepted the 'fraudulent' credit card).  You are still out $250.

If you are a 501c3, you can use the word 'donation', otherwise call it a 'contribution' or 'tip'.  You may need to declare the cash value of the contributions as income at the value at the time of transfer. This is easy as the blockchain is your ledger with timestamps and historic price information is easily available.
If you are a 501c3 then you may need to figure out how to provide receipts for the donator's taxes, but I've donated bitcoin to several 501c3's with no plan to claim it on my taxes.

Many smaller merchants pay their suppliers with credit cards. Just as the merchant had to add 2-5% to their prices to cover the expense of accepting cards, the suppliers also have to add 2-5% to cover the card fees, too.  If that supplier has other suppliers (most do) then this just compounds over and over again.  All the customers get hit with these fees, directly or indirectly.  Bitcoin can eliminate that overhead completely.

If a merchant is selling non-physical items (downloads, services, etc.), bitcoin offers a fast, safe and secure method for transacting globally without the need to capture/track/protect personal information.  For example, I can donate to [Sean's Outpost]( simply by using my wallet program of choice to send bitcoin.  There is less friction than any of the other payment methods, and I don't end up on a mailing list.
Bitcoin is not debt-based, so I am not going to get an invoice at the end of the month.
If Bitcoin payment processors like Coinbase or BitPay are used, the local currency can be deposited directly into the merchant's bank account without requiring any understanding of Bitcoin. The merchant gets the transacted value (if the merchandise is US$100, then US$100 is paid to the merchant) without volatility risk (some Bitcoin processors charge up to 1% as an exchange fee, but some are completely free).
As a merchant, there is no risk of charge-back.
As a consumer, I enjoy the ability to provide only the personal information required for shipping my physical merchandise. I do not have to worry about the merchant protecting my credit card details or double-charging my card.

I like Electrum since it has deterministic addresses and I can keep the private keys on an offline computer (a cheap Raspberry Pi) used only to sign transactions. You can create an Electrum watch-only wallet (the public keys only) and have it safely on your daily computer.  Create a transaction with the online wallet, move it to the offline wallet for signing, then transmit it from the online wallet.  Relatively easy, very safe, very secure.  Also with Electrum, you just need to securely store the seed value for the wallet so you can restore it later should something happen to the private key/offline computer.
If you are worried about the server piece, you can run a full node with bitcoind but not use the walelt, and then run your own SPV server that Electrum uses.  Less worry about it going totally offline if that is a concern.

No, they wouldn't have obtained your private key to begin with. Using a credit card, you have to provide all of the card and personal details that make the comprimise easy. With bitcoin you control your private keys and push the payment to the merchange, they don't pull from the card processor.  You'd still have your $9k in BTC.

If you use a payment processer like BitPay or Coinbase, they guarantee the value you bring in is deposited to your account (less a currency exchange fee). This exchange fee is around 1%.  If your business accepts credit cards, you are paying fees anywhere from 2-5%.  Don't you have better uses for that money?
Since the payment processor handles the price fluctuations for you, there is no volatility risk to your business, so you can continue to focus on your business rather than the exchange rate.  Simply the 1% exchange fee.  They also shield you from double-spends and charge-backs.  There is no risk to you or your business.
Employees can accept payments, but they cannot spend from the account. This may be a problem today when working with cash.
How do you pay your suppliers?  Most businesses pay them with credit cards.  There's another 2-5% fee that your suppliers have built into the price you pay.  If you can eliminate that fee almost completely, down to mere pennies, can the supplier give you a break on price?  If you are getting a break on price that your competitors still have to pay, that gives you a real advantage.  
Combined with the savings you got from accepting bitcoin from your customers, we're up to 4-10% in savings.  Don't you have better uses for that money?
So, the up-front costs for accepting bitcoin payments? It depends on your busiiness, but in-person transactions will require a cheap tablet or smartphone (you probably already have this).  If you do business on the Internet, BitPay and Coinbase have easy tools for you to include in your website that work with many online shopping services.  They do not charge for these plugins.
If bitcoin indeed crashes, as you suggest, then you go back to the payment methods you use today.  You are exposed to no more risk than you have already become used to handling.
What questions do you have?
@_date: 2014-05-15 18:41:58
The credit card networks can handle many hundreds of transactions per second, and the bitcoin blocks have a maximum length that limits the number of bitcoin transactions per second. As others have stated, the max block size can be increased, but at this time the concern is that more bandwidth and storage is necessary to enable this.  As any change to the protocol requires a very large portion of miners to approve, this has simply not become an issue yet.

Yes, a 2 of 3 multisig between you, the recipient and Airbnb could potentially solve this. If Airbnb was the escrow provider, their system could have refunded your bitcoin after the 24 hour period with your approval.  If the recipient had acknowledged the deal within that time, the bitcoin would get deposited to Airbnb's confirmed reservation account and they distribute them however they usually would for a rental.

Commodity currencies are physical objects that have value by themselves, but can also be used to barter.  
In the US Revolutionary War period, whiskey was a very common commodity currency (in order to pay for the war, Alexander Hamilton proposed a tax on whiskey trading).
Commodities have value, like gold, but are difficult to transport over distance.  It was very difficult to send whiskey from one place to another without breakage, spillage, and drinkage :-)

I do not think it is possible, since you use the public key (not the public address) to build a multisig P2SH script.  P2SH addresses do not have a public key.

Hate to say it, but I think we've all been there with bitcoin-qt/core... then, like you, 'there has to be a better way...' and there is.
I found the bitcoin-qt interface lacking then tried Armory (it runs on top of bitcoin-qt/core, so needs the whole blockchain + its own 10G database it builds from the local blockchain). It's better than qt.  If you don't keep it up-to-date it takes 10 minutes to sync every time you start it. Very much pain in ass. Armory also lets you do the offline/online wallet stuff like Electrum but doesn't offer enough other features, IMO, to make it worth the pain.
I still prefer Electrum.

Absolutely Coinbase. I read elsewhere that the API is nearly identical to PayPal, so near $0 to implement and Coinbase will exchange your Bitcoin sales into cash deposit to your bank account with no financial risk to you.  I believe it will allow you to keep any portion in bitcoin.  While your suppliers will take some time to move to accepting bitcoin, this is the perfect way to take advantage of the low fees.

Both sets of instructions tell you to use BIP38 to encrypt the private key.  This is really important.  So even if your printer spools the file, the password/phrase is still needed to unlock the private key.

+1 on getting this in a contract. This will prove that you were both willing to accept it as a payment method.

It is not part of the protocol to allow adding a fee later.  I read here that someone was proposing a way to do that (I do not know if this has a BIP# yet).  IIRC it would be an opcode that indicated anyone can pay the fee.  This would allow merchants to pay fees for the customer.
Without a fee, the transaction will take awhile to confirm (perhaps 24 hours)

Sure.  Namecoin is similar to Bitcoin, so your DNS entry is signed by your Namecoin private key. All of the attributes of that entry can be maintained by that private key.  This is how you attach the IP address, but the spec supports an SSL signature.  Many other attributes have been standardized (whether there is a yet way to consume all of this is another story)

One reason is that it makes decreases anonymity, since your public address can be correlated across purchases (you donated to Tor anonymously, but purchase from Overstock with your shipping info).  Second, the transaction history becomes easier to see when your address sends some coins to one address and the change is returned to your address (it is very clear which amount was sent to someone). Third, the public key for the public address becomes visible, and while this does not currently identify the private key needed to sign transactions, it is a theoretical concern that spending from the same address all the time will eventually leak enough entries to make the private key stastically derivable (this explaination may not be entirely accurate, but the result is the same).
This is why HD wallets are preferable, as the spare change is sent to a new address. It is not as easy for a blockchain observer to determine which of the transaction outputs was to a merchant and which was the spare change.  It is not apparent which addresses are part of any given wallet.
Even though the blockchain is entirely public, you don't want to make it too easy for anyone to track your entire bitcoin balance and transaction history.  It's no one's business but your own. If you earn your income in bitcoin, you probably don't want everyone you transact with to be able to easily know your income or know everyone you transact with.  Even if entirely legal, someone can call into question your habits ("Oh, we see you spend bitcoin at McBurger regularly... we'll have to adjust your health insurance rates... it looks like you can afford to pay us more. Thanks!") or see that you are away from home.

This is just another reason for people to use Bitcoin.  Banks/government would not be able to deduct taxes/fees/fines from your wallet unless you provided them with the private key (obviously, that would be a bad idea).  Control your own private key and you control your money.
Regulations like this are pushing people to "plan B" (Bitcoin).

The frictionless means of value transfer is another huge benefit.   Even very small amounts are easy to send.  The fee is the same (roughly $0.05 USD) no matter how much you want to send (large amounts over a certain value don't require any fee). 
Here's a coffee ...
Say you read about a good charity and would like to contribute a small amount. You can send them a small donation instantly, without having to provide any personal information.  Instant, secure, over and done.  For example, you can contribute some of that tip to [Sean's Outpost]( (a homeless shelter in Pensacola FL that has fed tens of thousands of meals from bitcoin donations alone).  
Or you can pay by credit card entering your first name, last name, middle initial, street address, city, state, zip, area code, phone number, credit card number, security code, and expiration date, and possibly email address (sometimes twice).  AND you have to hope they keep that information safe and secure and don't spam you asking for more money tomorrow.
Which is easier, faster, and more secure?  That's what we mean by frictionless.
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:59:42
Bitcoin is programmable money.  The first implementation is peer-to-peer payments.  The second is multi-signature (2 of 3 private keys must sign to release the funds, for example).  There are many more possibilities that have not even been considered, where sending value is frictionless and reliable.
Back in 1994, there was this thing called the Internet and the main implementation was for sending email.  Forward 20 years and anyone can have free visual phone calls with a dozen people from around the world.

She overheard me ask the clerk if he knew how to ring up a Bitcoin transaction and she started asking questions and I let her watch my transaction. The clerk rang up the sale, showed me the QR code, I scanned it with my phone, verfied the amount and unlocked my PIN. Instantly the store's register saw the transaction hit the network and I was done.  The woman commented on how much simpler my transaction was than her credit transaction.
@_date: 2014-10-01 20:46:30
I did not RTFA so this is just a guess from prior concerns that have been discussed.  Since lightweight clients require a connection to a full node (or specialized Simple Payment Verification, SPV, or custom service) to retrieve balances for an address, that the service will see your bitcoin addresses.  Using Tor will help mask the user's IP address.  Using HTTPS helps prevent someone on the network from seeing the addresses, but the service still has to see them. Disabling logs keeps that information hidden.
I am not sure of the concerns go so far as to worry about the security of BIP32 addresses though (since the server sees all of the individual addresses being queried). 
@_date: 2014-09-13 18:00:37
WouIdn't it help to see it in use for awhile before making this determination?  Many technologies advertised as secure were soon found to be otherwise.

This is why it is recommended that large amounts of Bitcoin are safest on paper wallets or in a wallet stored on a computer that does not (and possibly never had) an Internet connection.

Without discussing hard forks, today when two miners solve a winning block at approximately the same time, some peers see each block. When one chain gets longer, the rest of the network adopts the longer chain. Any transactions in orphaned blocks that are not in the longest chain get returned to the unconfirmed transaction pool and will be included in a future block.  Not a big deal.
With a hard fork, peers using the old code will not be able to confirm newer-style blocks.  Protocol updates, where the format or validation rules for a block change, require a vast majority of the processing power to agree with and implement the code change to prevent this split from happening. 
@_date: 2014-06-16 14:28:05
People have heard about mining and usually ask about it.  In order to explain it, you might find yourself talking about blocks, hash functions, transactions and nonces.  It can quickly overwhelm and confuse your audience unless you describe it methodically.  Think ahead of how you want to describe it without dumbing it down too much.  If done well, you can leave the door open to discuss multisig and other features of programmable money.
Another aspect that confuses people is that bitcoin is not backed by anything. Ask about USD and they will usually tell you that it is backed by gold. It has not been since 1972.  This often makes the point without having to dive deeper.
The question often comes up "why, as a consumer should I use this?" so describe the fees and charge-backs that a merchant has to cover with higher prices. Also describe how, today, the merchants convert back to fiat, but in the future, their supply chain will accept bitcoin as well, making for a more fluid payment system.  Most merchants pay their supply chain with credit cards or expensive fund transfers, and that all of the extra 2-5% fees magically go away.

Consider setting up different types of wallets for different needs.  In general, use offline (paper/cold storage) for long term savings (roughly equivalent to your retirement account, online computer hot wallet for general use (similar to your savings account, where you want access but not frequently), then perhaps a smartphone wallet for daily spending (like your conventional cash wallet).  You don't put all of your Bitcoin on your smartphone, just what you want handy.
For different purposes, such as donations versus trading and buying, you may want to create entirely separate wallets.  BIP32 standard is for HD (Hierarchic Deterministic) wallets, that allows one master key to generate unique addresses as needed. Within that wallet, you can create subaccounts (or subtrees) for each of your needs. This would provide clear separation of donations from other bitcoin that you own (there is no practical limit to the number of subtrees and sub-subtrees).
With BIP32, a subtree may have a 'master public key'. This could be safely coded inside a website to generate donation addresses dynamically.  The private key for that subtree, or the 'master private key' could be used to move funds from those accounts, so it needs to be kept secret and not encoded on the website.
Hope this helps. I realize that this can be confusing.  Ask questions!

i agree that it is just one more payment mechanism to them.  But if they are still going to take 4% then merchants will just go 'native' bitcoin for practically free.

Included in each transaction is a fee (about $0.06US right now). In addition to getting brand new bitcoins for mining a block, the miner also gets these transaction fees included in that block.
The new bitcoin reward was (is) incentive for people to mine while the bitcoin usage is lowest (few transactions were taking place).  As adoption takes off, there will be more transactions (thus more fees) passing through the network, so these fees will become the bigger part of the reward earned by the miners.

Bitcoin by itself has a very limited scripting language (purposefully).  So it can do multisignature and a few other tricks, it was never meant to contain lots of more advanced scripting abilities.
The Ethereum project was going to create an independent blockchain that had a more extensive scripting language, and Ethereum was intended for tracking digital assets other than just bitcoin balances, as well as digitally coded contracts.
Counterparty, in my limited understanding, was also trying to track other digital assets and investments, but using Bitcoin's blockchain that already has miners, infrastructure and adoption.  This allows for the extra scripting capabilities plus allows for contracts to interact with bitcoin assets.

Back in the old days, when I was a young child, I was taught to put my money in a bank because (in the old days) the money would earn interest.  So if I put $100 from grandma in the bank, in a year I would have earned $6 in interest.  Banks don't often pay interest these days (or 0.01% at JPMC), but when they did, people would still spend some of their money.  It's an amazing concept: I could save it and it would be worth more next year, or spend some and have a bit of money left and got to use whatever item.
People will still spend their money.
When a country borrows $1M the interest rate gets locked in at the time the loan is made.  If they can print extra money, that makes each dollar borrowed worth a little less and makes it easier to pay back the loan and interest.  The group making the loan gets their $1M back plus interest, but because of inflation, it doesn't have the same purchasing power as it looked like on paper at the time the loan was made.

Transacting in Bitcoin in a busy bar atmosphere is a bit of a challenge as the customer would need to use their phone to pay and the bartender needs to confirm that a payment was submitted.  
Besides zero-confirmation concerns (this may be a tolerable risk) the bartender may be slowed down waiting to receive confirmation that the payment hit the bitcoin network.  Time is money, so this is a particular concern in a busy bar.
If there are waiters/waitresses, they could certainly use smartphones to relay the customer orders to the bartender (who's only job is to make drinks). In this case, the waiter may also be able to handle the bitcoin payment validation while at the table with the customer (or before the drinks are served).

Bitcoin is just changing out of its work clothes after a long day of mining.  It is getting ready for shopping as we speak.  Before we can do that, though, we still need to find an ATM (ways to obtain Bitcoin) before hitting the mall.

Create a paper wallet with BIP38 encryption (such as  and the paper wallet tab and encrypted with a passphrase).  You can send bitcoin to the public address for longer term storage.  You can easily store the encrypted private key QR in your wallet (save a copy in a lock-box or other storage).
Mycelium gives you two options for spending from this paper wallet: 1) You can temporarily unlock the paper wallet or 2) you can permanently import the paper wallet to Mycelium. In either case, you enter the encryption passphrase and Mycelium will unlock the private key.
It is convenient, safe, and easy to store the encrypted QR in your physical cash wallet, for situations where you need some extra money.  If you lose your cash wallet, the finder would have to know the passphrase to spend from it.  Since you stored a copy in a lock-box, you can still access your coins.

When you pay online with a credit card, you have to give your identity, address, contact info, card number, and security code.  This is the same information that was stolen from Target.  The same information a crook needs to charge my card.  
While the card company will reverse the bogus charge, the merchant who was scammed is now out the price of the merchandise, and the merchandise as well.  This causes prices to rise to cover these losses.  In many industries, this has a negative impact to the profit margin. The merchant can't stop taking credit cards, so they have to live with this situation.  The customer isn't aware of all this, but they complain when prices go up.
With Bitcoin, the merchant may get my address for shipping (if it applies), but they only ever see my public address for my bitcoin wallet, so there is zero chance of someone stealing the rest of my bitcoins with this information.  None.  I retain control of the private key.  Bitcoin is a 'push' model (I transfer funds to them) rather than the credit card 'pull' model (they charge my card).

From what I gather it provides a platform for building many of the services we're familiar with, but the files will be secured via safecoin private keys.  Sounds like some of the basic capabilities will be there early, but any other type of service could be written on top of it.  Documents can be secured by granting access to other user's public keys or the files could be made publicly viewable.
So, it would be decentralized storage that will allow a web that can't be censored.  At least that is what I can figure out from the available materials.  The goal would be a web that is secured by default (rather than open by default).  What we're used to having as centralized services might become decentralized.  Need to know more.

I was at a store on Cleveland's Bitcoin Boulevard. The woman in front of me was trying to sign the pad for her credit card purchase, but her hand kept accidentally hitting the 'cancel' button on the pad.  She finally signed on the third try.
I asked if I could pay with Bitcoin. She started asking about it, and watched as the clerk displayed the QR code and I simply scanned it with my phone and entered my PIN. Over done. Painless.  The woman commented  at how fast my transaction was compared to hers.  When I explained how my payment credentials never leave my phone, she was really impressed.
Then there was a Redittor visiting France and found a bar that accepted Bitcoin. He posted on Facebook and a friend asked him to send him a photo of the QR code from his tab.  Someone in Miami used Bitcoin to buy a drink for his friend in France.  The merchant would not let you do that with credit cards or cash.

Frankly, we're not.  It just has a substantial lead.  Being open-source and not tied to any single government also helps substantially.
If any country creates their own cryptocurrency, it may find use inside their borders, but it would have difficulty finding acceptance beyond that.  if any business creates their own cryptocurrency, it is unlikely that other businesses would accept it.  In both cases, fear over manipulation would likely be a large reason for the distrust.

Please provide some other scenarios for consideration. 
I was simply working off the block hash value for a specific block as equivalent to selecting numbers (as in current lottery systems).  The immense computational power necessary to find a normal winning bitcoin block hash (even without the lottery) means that the risk of someone trying to carry out this attack to find one that also matched some other criteria would be extremely unlikely to succeed.
You would need to also assume that a large majority of the miners are also playing this lottery and thus have a vested interest in the scam.  All it takes is one of the disinterested miners to do their normal solving of the block to ruin any attempt at rigging the system.
One approach to the lottery might be that all bets are confirmed at least X blocks prior to the block that would be used in the drawing.  Say X is 10.  In order to scam the system, a mining pool would need to calculate 10 consecutive blocks ahead of time, which would be a challenge.

They both are open source but unsure on audits.  There are advantages and disadvantages to web wallets.  
With Electrum you can run two copies, one with the signing private key and another watch-only with just the public part.   You can keep the signing version on a Raspberry Pi offline, then keep the watch-only wallet on your regular computer safely. Create a transaction from the watch-only copy, move it to the Pi for signing, then return to the watch-only wallet to submit. This is a very secure configuration.  You certainly don't need to do this, but Electrum lets you have this level of control.

When you go to the ATM for cash, you probably get $20 bills.  When you use that bill to buy a soda for $1.50, you expect $18.50 in change.
'Unspent transaction outputs' are the bitcoin equivalent of a $20 bill.  If someone sent you 1.0 BTC, your wallet program recognizes that you have this amount that can be unlocked with your private key (and any other amounts that were sent to you and not yet spent... we'll just work with this one transaction).
If you want to buy a soda for 0.0025 BTC, your wallet will need to sign a transaction to unlock that 1.0 BTC then send 0.0025 BTC to the vending machine and the spare change to an address in your wallet (some wallet programs use the sending address, some create a 'change' address to make this less obvious to observers), less the transaction fee of 0.0001 BTC.  So 0.0025 BTC to the vending machine and 0.9974 BTC gets returned to your wallet.
Just like a $20 bill, you can't tear in into small pieces, you need to spend it in its entirety.  Likewise, bitcoin transaction outputs sent to you must be consumed in their entirety. The 0.9974 becomes a new transaction output that your wallet can spend next time.  The extra 0.0001 BTC is the transaction fee paid to the network.
Now, instead, if you have 1.0 BTC balance in your wallet, but it came from 4 transactions of 0.25 BTC each, the wallet will only unlock one of those to buy the soda.  But if you wanted to buy something worth 0.40 BTC, the wallet would unlock two of the 0.25 BTC transactions (for a total of 0.50 BTC) and receive 0.0999 BTC as change (again, the 0.0001 transaction fee).
This logic of spending an entire transaction output makes it easier for mining software and wallet programs to track which transaction outputs have not been spent (unspent transaction outputs = UTXO) rather than partial transactions. Your bitcoin wallet adds these and displays a single balance for you.
TL/DR; your bitcoin wallet program automatically consumes spendable amounts in their entirety and returns change to an address in your wallet for later use.

Multi-sig wallets can prevent another MtGox, but this license does not describe that as an option.
If an online multisig wallet is ordered to keep all customer balances in USD, they are going to be unable to comply.  Since the wallet provider doesn't have access to the customer's bitcoin, it is already more secure than banks and MtGox.  Making them convert that to USD introduces vulnerabilities into an otherwise secure system.

Good questions.  A bitcoin wallet doesn't hold your bitcoin, but it does contains a private key and a public address for your account.  The public address is, well, public.  Anyone who wants to send you funds can send them to the public address.  In order to spend funds, the transaction needs to be signed by the private key associated with that public address.
If you keep your private key a secret (a must!), then no one can spend your funds or sweep your wallet.  Your wallet program manages the private key and signs your transactions, so you don't really need to 'see' it.
A backup of your private key is (hopefully) encrypted with a passphrase, so that no one who finds it can immediately use it.  Should you lose the computer/smartphone holding your wallet, you can restore the private key to another device.  At this point you should create a new wallet (a new private/public pair) and send the bitcoin from the old wallet to the new public address.
The public key is not something you need to protect.  There is no mathematical formula that can work backwards from the public address to derive the private key.  However, the reverse is not true: The public address can be (must be!) derived from the private key.
If you use an Android phone (iPhones don't currently support Bitcoin wallet apps), the best bitcoin wallet is Mycelium.  When you download and install Mycelium, it generates a private key and public address.  It will nag you to create a backup, which is a PDF file and also a string of characters.  You can safely email the PDF to another computer and print it on a printer.  Mycelium will then ask you to verify the backup by scanning the QR code from the PDF and also enter the string of characters (just having the PDF alone is not sufficient, and just the string alone is also not sufficient).  Once you scan the PDF and enter the string, Mycelium will validate them and ensure that you have a good backup.  Mycelium will stop nagging you about backups at this point.
Store the PDF somewhere secure, or make copies of it for your safety deposit box or a friend.  Write down the string and save it separately (perhaps with another friend).
Should you lose your smartphone, you can load Mycelium on another phone, then scan the QR from the PDF and enter the string of characters. This will restore the private key and public address to the new device.
Best practice is to use a paper wallet for long term storage (read about that elsewhere) and your smartphone for your normal use.  Mycelium will allow you to spend from a paper wallet without storing the keys, or you can load the keys permanently.
Let me know if you have additional questions!

To spend bitcoin you have to unlock your private key (a PIN you enter on your phone), scan a QR code for the payee's wallet address, confirm the amount and you're done. The transaction cost is $0.05 USD for any amount from $0.00001 to $100M (or more) to send instantly anywhere in the world.
Keep a relatively small amount on the wallet on your smartphone for daily spending.  Best practice is to keep most of your bitcoin in a paper wallet (the private key is stored, sometimes encrypted, on a piece of paper) and you have long term storage.
In case you lose your phone you can use a backup of the private key on another device or computer to send the bitcoin from that old private key to another (or new) wallet you control.  Easy, fast, secure.  You control the bitcoin if you control your private key.  It works because the wallet only contains the private keys, not the bitcoin (those are stored on the public distributed ledger).
Also, the payee can't possibly charge you again (no more credit card theft - hear that Target??).  The payee doesn't even need your name. There is no risk that the transaction will be declined (unless you deliberately try to double-spend). Once it is done, it's done.
Edit: 'Programmable money': Multisignature wallets are just getting started, so you can have your long-term bitcoins stored where it requires 2 of 3 private keys to spend them. You can store these keys in three places or give to a few friends for safe keeping (they would need to agree to take your coins).
@_date: 2014-06-09 03:03:00
Best practice for a paper wallet (your long term storage) is that a spend is done from that address once and only once (you can have many transactions that add to the balance however).  Since the wallet was unlocked by spending from it, there is a risk that a keylogger or screen capture intercepted that private key.  Granted, it is not always possible or practical to direct spare change to another paper wallet public address, but this is the recommended approach.

They purposefully do not want Bitcoin to have loops or functions that might take too long to execute as it might be used to DDOS the miners if they have to process them.  Etherium is supposed to have more scripting capabilities and will also limit the number of steps a script can take before getting cancelled (as a way of preventing this problem).  Since Etherium can operate on its own blockchain and can handle many types of property, it was deemed better for Bitcoin to stick to money and not complex scripting.
This is also why transactions with nLocktime in the future can't be submitted to Bitcoin, either. No one wanted to store all those pending transactions. I understand there are some websites that let you post them and will submit them at the appropriate time.

Most exchanges did not rely on a constant transaction id, as MtGox did.  We know this because of the numerous articles posted earlier this week by these exchanges.  Only one exchange has had to shutter their processing to re-balance their accounts.
These transaction id changes occur naturally with no harm to any exchange except MtGox.  While the natural occurrence was small enough that MtGox only realized their errors recently, this is separate from the DoS attack yesterday.
The DoS amplified the natural occurrence thousands of times over, and in a short period of time.  This did cause problems for many more wallets and exchanges as they had to expend valuable computational cycles to fully validate each occurrence.  Still, these exchanges were not resubmitting transactions on behalf of their customers.  Wallet balances, while unavailable temporarily, were not ultimately affected.
This artificial volume needs to be viewed as an attack on the network, leveraging a known issue beyond natural levels.
I have no doubt that there are other weaknesses that have not been exploited.  It took 20 years with some of the most common Internet protocols to see and fix many weaknesses, but there are always more.  The Internet has not had to shut down as a result.
The fixes to Bitcoin were implemented quickly to resolve this problem.  This will certainly bring more attention (wanted and malicious) to other weaknesses.
However, the invention that is the blockchain is quite resilient.  It did withstand this DoS attack, with only minor service interruptions.  It still has my trust.  Don't buy more Bitcoin than you are willing to lose, but in the meantime, enjoy the ride! It will be a wild one!

This might be possible if the Federal Reserve (in the US at least) created a cryptocoin and declared it to have value always matched 1:1 with the dollar.
For example, there are websites that let you design your own cryptocurrency.  You pick the method for coin creation and mining, and other limitations or capabilities your coin would have.  There will easily be millions of cryptocurrencies.
The characteristics chosen for FedCoin would certain dictate the viability of it over the long term.  There would likely be centralized control over it (Bitcoin is decentralized) and everyone would have to trust the caretakers to manage it effectively.
Bitcoin tries to solve many of the problems with traditional currencies by eliminating single points of failure with no one group having complete control over it and there is a limited supply.
One of the concerns Bitcoin has with the Fed is that they print money all the time, decreasing the net value of everyone's holdings (you pay more for a quart of milk today than you did 10 years ago, because there is always more money being created).  Bitcoin has a set limit and a set, predictable, rate at which coins are mined.  In theory this should prevent inflation and would cause deflation (your bitcoin may get more valuable over time).
Not every country wants the US Fed to have complete control over the world currency.  Either they want that control or don't trust the Fed.  Since it would be centralized, it may not be accepted everywhere (I would be pretty sure you would not be able to send FedCoin to support Wilileaks).
So, yes, the Fed could create FedCoin, but it's properties may make it unsuitable for a world currency.

The basic concept of the blockchain is that distributed computers can agree on what the ledger should look like via math.  The Bitcoin blockchain is designed for Bitcoin, but the same concept could be used to track ownership of anything.
There is the Namecoin project that uses almost identical code to Bitcoin, but it is tracking DNS names instead of account balances.  I believe you can transfer control of that DNS name just as easily as you can send someone a bitcoin.
A similar blockchain design could track real estate ownership, car registrations, library books, or nearly anything else.

Certainly not for a single merchant.  
But is a necessary first step.  I have rarely (if ever) purchased from Overstock.  However, there is good name recognition, and they provide more products than alpaca socks.  The average consumer probably doesn't shop there regularly, but they recognize the name and think "if Overstock is getting into this Bitcoin thing, maybe there is some substance to this".
This gives bitcoin some reputation and provides more justification for merchants to start accepting it.  As more brick-and-mortar POS systems integrate with bitcoin, it will become more ubiquitous.  
Already we have small merchants accepting it for the security aspects.  The pizza delivery or newspaper salesman on the corner no longer have to worry about being robbed.  Splitting a tab with friends doesn't require exact change.
This is all marketing for Bitcoin.  The promise of electronic wallets has been marketed for years.  Bitcoin is the first offering (and perhaps the only one on the horizon) that won't have a high overhead for customers or merchants to use.
Sure, there is a long way to go, but we are taking the first steps.

Nothing says you need to be in debt up to your arse.  Figure out what you might be easily be willing to (or are currently paying) in rent, then put enough down on the loan to get your monthly payment to that level.  When I was buying a house I decided that $500/mo was reasonable (where I live) for an apartment, and I was still able to pay it off 20 years early. Then I bought the house next door for $500/mo and rent it to some good friends.  Now I have two properties, rental income that could pay the mortgage, and friends living nearby.  Should have the second house paid off in a few months.

I wouldn't have an issue with it if there were a chance to contest this in court.  Once a judge hears both sides of the story and decides that the payment is due, then a reasonable payment plan can be imposed (allowing for food and rent).  Emptying someone's account to pay back taxes is not an action that should be imposed lightly.

Rather than diving into the guts of Bitcoin's encryption, why not focus instead on how it works in practice for person-to-person payments? You won't need to overwhelm them with encryption and hash functions, and you can keep the discussion at a more general level.
If you focus on teaching them the protocol, they will tend to try to reinvent it.  If you focus on how a payment is made and how the blockchain tracks it, they can design a merchant system or a customer system instead.  That would IMO be much more realistic in a bootcamp.
Allow the class to write programs that display a QR code and react when a payment to that address was received.  They can build on existing API's like blockchain.info or others.

If the company already accepts bitcoin and the employee wants to be paid in bitcoin, it simply removes the middle layers of conversion to/from cash.  Fewer fees on both ends of the conversion.
If the company deals in cash but the employee wants to get paid in bitcoin, then yes, it is simply removing the conversion step for the employee's convenience.  However, the employee may be able to get a better exchange rate if they shop around.
The exchange rate at the time of payment would determine any tax implications.

In all honesty, as an IT person, IBM would not have utilized the bitcoin blockchain in any case.  They want to be able to control the implementation, processing, and security behind their solution.  They have a long history of reimplementing existing open-source technologies for their own needs, and this is perfectly acceptable.
With the amount of non-bitcoin data they would potentially want to store in this blockchain, it is beneficial for Bitcoin that this is kept separate.
Since Ethereum promises a blockchain for more general purposes, it might be a closer implementation for IBM's needs than Bitcoin's.

I like the approach this article takes  in explaining a challenge and then how that problem gets solved in the Bitcoin protocol.
It would allow the students to understand one problem, fix it, then move on to the next issue (much like real life, eh?)

Sounds like you will have to focus in on a very narrow set of topics. Important concepts are that it is a method for tracking ownership of digital assets. Compare it to music/movies and bittorrent in that it is peer to peer, however the distributed network is able to form agreement on the transfer of assets (versus just making copies of digital files).  How Bitcoin is the first implementation of distributed consensus.  It is a protocol for transferring ownership, standardized and usable much like email or http used on the Internet without regard to computer manufacturer. Advantages of an open protocol being that it is distributed around the globe, and usable by anyone. It is not under the control of any corporation or group of individuals. Person-to-person payments are just the first capability, like email was in 1994 before web browsers, so many more capabilities can be built on top of it, just as Facebook/Twitter/Reddit were built on the http protocol.  This brings capabilities to the individual, rather than institutions, such as multi-signature accounts and escrow, which can substantially reduce fraud and financial abuse.
In the Q&amp;A you can probably discuss mining and how it secures the ledger. Advantages to the customer and to merchants and to the merchant's supply chain via reduced fees and instant transfer of value globally. Future developments underway such as Lighthouse (fully automated Kickstarter) and Ethereum (tracking digital assets other than just bitcoin). Bitcoin allows artists to get paid directly by the consumers without requiring a credit card or permission from gatekeepers.
Much to cover in just a small time, but those are points I would try to present. Let the Q&amp;A lead you into the slightly more detailed discussions.

IF this means what I think (no guarantee as I think I fell asleep halfway through), the premise is that mining will cease because it will reach a point where it is no longer profitable.
This has been properly dismissed before.
1) Yes, mining reward gets cut in half every 4 years, but the block size is expected to be expanded meaning transaction fees will replace them. That is what Satoshi intended.
2) Yes, mining equipment gets outdated quickly.  If it becomes less profitable to constantly buy new equipment, there will be enough of the older equipment to balance out.  An old IT saying that still holds true: "Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon filled with floppy disks"  Some people will have expensive fast equipment, but many more will have slower equipment.

While the author enjoys a kickback from Visa, the merchant has to pay additional fees.  Thanks for prompting the merchants to raise their prices.
Bitcoin, via Coinbase, may have the 1% 'surcharge', but there are merchants offering discounts to those paying with Bitcoin.  Even if they don't, this is a payment system that is still young, so we, as a community, are wiling to pay a bit more to help spread merchant adoption.
In return for the 1% surcharge you mention, I also have no risk of getting double charges from a rogue merchant or employee, and the merchant has additional security from charge-backs and employee theft.  The speed at which the payment is available to the merchant is significantly faster with bitcoin, even if they have it converted to fiat.
Visa is simply using you as a marketing experiment, tracking each purchase and recording it for all time.  The kickback comes in the hope that you will miss a payment, allowing them to raise your interest rate from 9% to 29%.  Have fun.  Their terms of service change at least annually. The merchant gets charged more because you use a card with kickbacks, so I am sure they aren't as thrilled as you are.
You can keep your plastic.  I will keep spending Bitcoin. There is no marketing gimmick, no tracking of my purchases, no such thing as late payments or interest penalities, and no changes to the terms of service.  This, combined with greater security and privacy, makes Bitcoin a winner for me.
Merchants are going to enjoy the increased security from using Bitcoin. As their suppliers also adopt Bitcoin, the entire accounting chain will see increased speed and efficiency.  This may lead to more merchants offering a Bitcoin discount.  The more distant future may even see merchants dropping credit cards in favor of Bitcoin, as they won't have to maintain the payment card infrastructure and security concerns they need to implement with credit cards.

It's a bother, but the blockchain makes it very easy to track the transactions to/from your public addresses. You can get USD/BTC pricing info for each transaction from an online service, so this lets you calculate purchase price and selling price.
The blockchain makes the job of calculating capital gains/losses a helluva lot easier than trying to track other properties.
Even if your wallet program adds this feature, you have to remember not to count transfers between wallets you own (like transfers between your Coinbase, your Electrum, and your Mycelium).  Only when you send to someone else.
The tax rules get very weird if you send a donation/gift, as the receiver is supposed to 'inherit' the purchase value from when you bought the coins (how the heck are they supposed to know that??).

I did this with Electrum, which is also a lightweight wallet like MultiBit.  The feature I like in MultiBit is the ability to enter amounts in either currency.  Electrum has a price plugin, but it is only used for your balance, not for the transaction.
But Electrum lets you create the transaction on the online wallet, and sign it with the offline wallet, then back to the online wallet to transmit it.

I'm afraid the sticking point for adoption is that there are not many exchange options.  Find a smaller bank (credit unions generally provide better service and interest rates) that will work with Coinbase.  The other solution is localbitcoins.com, yet they charge a premium as well.
Otherwise, you will need to encourage your boss and/or landlord to handle transactions differently.  Let your boss know this is causing issues and to increase pay to cover the exchange fees.

-Low/No Transaction Fees
-Customer maintains control of their credentials
-No (or much less) personal information is necessary to transact
Since there are no chargebacks or 3-5% fees taken off the top like credit cards, many merchants are already offering discounts for using bitcoin.
For every chargeback, the merchant is out the $$$ and the merchandise, so they have to increase prices elsewhere to cover their losses.  Consumers pay for this.  We ALL pay for this.
Merchants currently my need to store (thus secure) credit card data, and they are doing it poorly.  There is little security concern with bitcoin since the public addresses are already public.
While the lack of chargebacks can be viewed as a downside for the consumer, escrow will solve many of the problems and there will be no rogue charges as long as the consumer controls their wallet.
This is also just the beginning.
Phase 1: peer-to-peer payments
Phases 2-999: escrow, M of N transactions, digital contracts.  These are going to add capabilities that we can't even comprehend with cash/credit.  Just as email was pretty much the first application for the Internet, there are going to be many new capabilities that digital currencies will enable.

Regardless of whether you agree or disagree with taxes, there is such a thing as public infrastructure.  
Do you prefer paved roads or dirt roads?  Are traffic lights good or bad?  Trash pickup a luxury or necessity?  Does someone donate the land for dumping trash or do we just take someone's land?  Who provides the poor house for the people unable to pay their utilities?
I am not saying that all of the categories I listed are ones I agree with, but they exist (some of them for good reason).  I would rather be able to designate which public infrastructure I want to support than have some politician getting kickbacks for programs no one wants.
If a voluntary designation system works, then I would guess individual's tax debt could be reduced.

Some merchants are considering handling refunds as they would cash or a check, which means they refund the price via an in-store gift card.  Certainly there are customers that want the bitcoin back or no longer want to shop at your store (bad experience, selection, etc.)
If you refund the current value of the bitcoin, that means your store will need to keep some bitcoin available.  Luckily the cash drawer can be one wallet that only the owner/manager can unlock. Refunds can be made from a limited wallet that the manager or employees can unlock.  This limits the potential risk from employee theft.

If PayPal didn't get there first, then it perhaps a poor business decision.  If they want to get there in the future, then get to it and innovate.
I understand where there are perceived conflicts on Mark's part, but also see that these are similar companies working in different markets.  It would not be hard to see the rationale for investing in a Bitcoin payment system when the fiat version is a separate flavor.

Great idea!
I usually send them a few dollars (more if I know them), then have them send most of it back to me.  That way they experience both sides of the transaction and have a dollar or so to play with.
Another line I use is "Your wallet program included a transaction fee of 0.0001 bitcoin.  For that same $0.06US you could have sent $500 or $5 million.  You could have sent it to me, sitting right here, or to the other side of the world for the same fee."  That usually gets a positive reaction.
"Buying something on the Internet with a credit card involves you providing all of the personal details and credentials that a thief needs in order to use your credit card.  With Bitcoin, you control your private key, and no one else ever needs to see it."

Since credit card transactions have to pull from the card processor, the merchant needs all of your credentials.  Brick and mortar require scanning the physical card, but online shopping means entering all of your personal details and hoping the merchant's website handles these properly.
I still consider online credit card purchases about as safe as handing someone my bitcoin private key and hoping they only charge me the expected amount.
At least with bitcoin, I have options for better security (paper wallets, offline transaction signing, multisig, maintaining only a small balance in my phone's wallet). None of these capabilities are available for credit cards.

There are full nodes and there are miners. Both reference a full copy of the blockchain, but only miners are creating new blocks (see other discussions in this topic about mining).  Miners will reference a full node but may not have a complete copy locally.
When you submit a transaction to the Bitcoin network, your wallet program sends it to a variety of full nodes it is connected to.  They validate that the signature matches the transaction and that the owner of the signature has authority to spend the coins in the transaction.  If the transaction passes validation, it is sent to the other peers (full nodes). If it does not pass validation, the transaction is rejected and not passed along.
Likewise, when a miner finds a block, it is passed to all of the full nodes which also validate it (remember; it is hard to solve the problem but very easy to validate the result).  If the full nodes approve, they pass the block to their peers, otherwise they reject it.
While miners are working to build blocks, the full nodes are performing validation on the transactions and the blocks.  So it is still very useful to run a full node even if you don't have the power to mine.

Yes, paper wallets and Electrum both let you keep your private keys in an offline wallet.
For a paper wallet, you can use the Mycelium Android wallet to load the private key into memory (it can be password protected) and then send funds from that address.
For Electrum, you can keep a 'watch-only' online wallet (does not hold the private key), create your transaction file, load the transaction on the offline wallet to sign it with the private key, then back to the online wallet to transmit and send.

Reconciliation is based on the price of the purchased item (same as with cash or credit). If a bitcoin payment processor like BitPay or Coinbase is used, they can convert the bitcoin into the equivalent government currency and deposit that in your bank account.  They provide some tools that let you see your transaction history.
If you sell a $100 USD item for bitcoin, you are getting $100 worth of bitcoin as the exchange rate is set at the time of the transaction.  It's still $100 USD unless you keep the bitcoin... then the merchant needs to track the bitcoin for capital gains and losses per IRS rules.  If exchanging immediately 100% to USD, there are no capital gains or losses to worry about.

Certainly in order to spend, the private key must be used.  However, with BIP32 there is also a master public key that can be installed to make a watch-only configuration.  In that case, Myceliium could accept payments, but not make them.
There are times when you only want to watch balances or be able to receive payments.  Example: Store owner has devices at each register so cashiers can accept payments from customers using uniquely generated public addresses for each transaction.  Those cashiers would have no ability to spend the bitcoin.  Since only the owner held the master private key, only they would be able to spend from any of the public keys from the cashier's.

Also remember that, like email was the first protocol for the Internet, customer to merchant payments and merchant to supplier payments are just the first use of Bitcoin.

There are also authentication capabilities using Bitcoin that completely eliminate userids and passwords (look at BitId and BitAuth).
These are just capabilities here in the very near future.  There will be many more.  Just as no one in 1990 had even thought of Facebook, Twiitter, Skype nd smartphones, there are many more capabilities that can be built on top of Bitcoin.

The casual user or merchant transacting in cash is not regulated to this degree, so I would expect Bitcoin would be no different.
Where do regulators draw the (perhaps fuzzy) line between someone who transacts in cash and someone who is providing a financial service or investment advice?

The HD (heirarchical deterministic) wallets generate new addresses as needed from a base seed.  This makes it much easier to generate new addresses as you don't need another backup of your wallet.  Spare change from a transaction gets returned to a new address, helping with anonymity.
As stated elsewhere in this thread, reusing addresses might become a security exposure, but this is not a considerable risk at this time.
HD wallets also let you to give a unique address to everyone who transacts with you. It is probably a good idea IMO for people who send bitcoin to you frequently to use a consistent address.  Otherwise it would be like using a new email address for every message with the same person, which seems prone to errors (again, my opinion).  
For a merchant, giving each customer a unique static address to send bitcoin to you is probably a plus in that you can accurately group payments from the customer to their account.

For individuals, BitWage assigns you an ACH routing/account number that you enter in your company's payroll system as an additional direct deposit account (it looks and acts just like any other account you might use and most payroll providers allow you to specify multiple deposit accounts).  When the deposit is made and the payroll system's details reach BitWage, they purchase the bitcoin and deposit them to the public address you provided to them.  This has the advantage to the consumer in that you do not link your personal bank account to them, only a public address.
If a consumer were to use a recurring purchase via Coinbase, for example, you must provide your bank account.  
BitWage eliminates a step and avoids the need to link your bank account to their service and also eliminates the extra step of transferring bitcoin to your personal wallet.

Regarding point  (tl;dr) A transaction to spend indicates where to get the inputs from, but it doesn't work like a bank account balance, it is more detailed.  So, unless you are talking about funds set aside for a trust fund, you should provide the credentials that allow your heirs to sign transactions with your private key.
Read on for more details...
Every transaction has inputs and outputs.  The output is an amount and the 'encumberance' (the conditions that must be met) to spend that particular amount.    For example, you create TX1 that contains an output for 5 BTC that only your wallet can unlock.
Your wallet's balance is merely the sum of the outputs matching keys it knows it can directly unlock.
When you went to spend some of your bitcoin (spend those outputs), a new transaction is created (TX2) that indicates one (or more) of these outputs that will be consumed as an inputs to this new transaction (5 BTC from TX1).  The outputs of the new transaction may have several outputs, in our case 2.  The first output sends 2 coins to a payee (an encumberance that only their wallet can spend).  Another output is created for the 'spare change' (2.9999 bitcoin), an address in your wallet.  Any amount not designated (0.0001 bitcoin) becomes the transaction fee, which goes to the miner who confirms this transaction.
The gist of this is, the transaction you pre-sign specified the outputs to be spent.  Spending even one satoshi from that output consumes that transaction output forever, and sends it somewhere else.  So, it is not quite as simple as not having enough in the balance.
To sign a spend ahead of time, you would need to pre-sign TX3 consuming the 2.9999 from TX2 sending t to another predetermined address.  An optional block number or time in the future can be added. Any spend of the 2.9999 from TX2 will invalidate TX3.
Complicated, I know, but ask questions (or correct me!) if necessary.

While you can't do offline signing of transactions (Electrum, Armory), you can increase security by encrypting the wallet with a strong password.
Best bet would be to run MultiBit and store the wallet on a computer that isn't normally connected to the Internet.  A RaspberryPi might be a nice cheap option (just backup the SD card).
Another, more complex, option might be to create a separate user on your existing machine and use TrueCrypt to create an encrypted container for your wallet file(s).  You can probably find instructions here or PM me if needed.
While a keylogger on your host may still put you at risk, the extra layers of protection, and the separate user id, may provide sufficient challenges to an attacker.

My understanding is that each bank verifies their own transactions against their own ledger.  When converting to another currency they use the net settlement that you described.  Sometimes, to get from currency A to currency C, there is no direct path, so they have to secure common currency B in the middle (there may also be currencies D and E in the middle, but usually not).
So the bank ensures the customer has sufficient funds in currency A, negotiates the exchange rate and excecutes a trade into currency B, wait for that to confirm, then negotiate and trade from B to currency C, wait for it to confirm, then deposit it in the account of the receiver.  Perhaps these confirmations take hours or days, with lots of middlemen taking their cut along the way.
Much inefficiency.  Bitcoin could act as that middleman (B) and reduce the confirmation times to 2 hours (6 confirms on the transfer from A to B and again for B to C).

Thanks for the clarification.  I was just basing it on how things work in the US.  Looking at our copyright 3-strikes law, the customer never gets a chance to contest the violation.

Here's my view on deflationary:
Keeping your dollars in a bank used to earn interest.  The predictable rate of deflation with Bitcoin provides that same increased value for saving, however the rate is predictable.  With dollars, it used to be standard to get 6% APR on your savings account, but it's been several years since the large banks paid more then 0.01% APR if anything.
The fed prints money as they need it, which makes my dollar worth less each month.  I'd rather be able to get a little more value than a little less.

I equate it to keeping some extra cash in my shoe.  It's there if I need it and safe (safer than my shoe) if something should happen to me.
If my smartphone is stolen and I still have an encrypted paper wallet, I might be able to (perhaps insecurely) spend some bitcoin using someone else's smartphone.
A few weeks ago there was a guy who invented a gas pump that accepted bitcoin. Just send the amount you want to spend to the QR code and pump your gas (excess funds get returned to the address).  If you run out of funds, you can read the public address for the pump to a friend who can send bitcoin and unlock the pump from the comfort of their home.  Interesting possibilities.  (When can I get some of my friends to do this instead of calling me at 3am??!)

OK, after playing around with Armory, I was finally able to find the private keys.  With Advanced user mode set, you can go to 'Wallet Properties/Backup This Wallet/See Other Backup Options', then select the 'Export Key Lists' radio button then 'Export Key Lists' button at the lower right.  This will display on the PrivBase58 line(s) your private keys (they start with '5', 'K', or 'L'). Now check the 'Omit Spaces' button.  You can copy these private keys into  on the 'wallet details' tab and get QR codes.
NOTE: New receiving addresses or change addresses in Armory are derived from the base seed rather than totally random (like new Mycelium addresses), so your Mycelium won't know about new addresses generated automatically in Armory.
Tip: Be careful. You might instead want to simply send some small amount of bitcoin to Mycelium for daily use. Using a shared private key means there are now two possible ways someone can get your bitcoins.

It is not your entire address balance that you are waiting on.  Bitcoin transactions spend outputs from a prior transaction.  So if you sent 10 BTC to ADR1 (your address), then try to send 3 BTC to ADR2 (someone else), your wallet will be waiting on confirmations to know that the 7BTC is still available to you.
*However*, if you have 3 transactions provided funds to ADR1, then you will have 3 transaction outputs that can be spent, **independent of each other**.  So, TX1 sends 4BTC to ADR1, TX2 sends 4BTC to ADR1, and TX3 sends 2 BTC to ADR1, you still have the same balance of 10BTC.  NOW, if you send 3BTC to ADR2, your wallet will build transaction TX4 to consume the output from TX1 (sending 3BTC to ADR2 and 1BTC back to ADR1 or a change address in your wallet).  The outputs from TX2 and TX3 are still available for you to spend, even if TX4 is still unconfirmed.
Does that help?  A lot happens behind the scenes.  Your wallet program figures out which previous transaction outputs it will use an inputs to the new transaction, and the selection logic may vary by wallet program.
Let us know if you have questions!

I've been in tech for 40 years, and really enjoy hearing your well-researched thoughts, experiences, and presentations. This is certainly a new area, and few are as immersed in the upcoming startups as you are.  
It's possible that detractors expect to hear more uncertainty and less confidence in the impact Bitcoin will have.
While I have (too much) experience with punch cards and 300-baud modems, the way the Internet quickly evolved and affected every relationship and industry is indeed a good indicator of the scale of the impact Bitcoin have to world economics and society.  There is absolutely no way that it can avoid it.
While most of us only have familiarity with a generally stable US currency, you bring experiences from other economies that are anything but stable.
This confidence in where Bitcoin is headed may be perceived by some to be a sales pitch.  I don't see you being a cheerleader or salesman (if you get the crowds chanting 'Bitcoin' I must have missed that video).  You have a well-considered understanding of how Bitcoin cannot *help* but change things, even if version 1.0 fails, the experiment is valuable.

I agree with on this. I would also suggest enabling a PIN to unlock your private key.  While Mycelium (may) not encrypt the private key, this at least slows down spending your bitcoin.  Use paper wallets for large amounts and long-term storage (think of it like your retirement account), and Mycelium for daily spending.  Mycelium will let you load the private key from  paper wallet (permanently or temporarily) and send from the paper wallet to your Mycelium wallet.  This is a handy feature.

Bitcoin relies heavily on hash functions. These functions look at every bit (1/0) in the source data and compute a hash value.  If any bit in the source data changes, the hash value will change in unpredictable ways.
The mining process in Bitcoin takes several components: the hash value from the previous block, a hash of all of the transactions in the block, and there is a placeholder for the nonce (the magic number).
When a miner creates the block, the very first transaction is called the 'coinbase' transaction (not to be confused with the company), which has no inputs and just an output to pay themselves the mining reward of 25 bitcoin (currently).
If the miner can find a nonce that, combined with the other fields, creates a hash value smaller than a predetermined difficulty value, then the miner has 'won' the block.  They pass this along to every other full node in the Bitcoin network and they can easily validate that the hash value was properly generated.  Once everyone agrees, the block is added to the blockchain.  Since the fields contain the hash value from the prior block, these perform a link of blocks (thus the name 'blockchain').
The target difficulty value adjusts every two weeks (every so many blocks) so that it requires roughly 10 minutes to generate a winning block.  Sometimes longer, sometimes shorter.
Since everyone can easily and quickly validate the work, it prevents someone from gaming the system.
Ask questions if you have them!

The blockchain remains immutable with a HF.  It is a change on consensus of validation rules.
A corporation has an general ledger.  The government issues new rules on what is allowed or restricted.  For example, there might be a new law that makes dictates class of business expenses are no longer tax exempt (this happens all the time).
This new rule does not change the general ledger, but affects new activity that might be written there.  The company can no longer record that type of business expense in the tax-deductible column, instead it goes to another column.
They claim "but if they can change X they might one day change Y".  Well, that might happen one day no matter what we do today.  It is not causation/correlation, however.

I am not familiar with breadwallet, but wanted to address some of the general concerns with blockchain.info (not THE blockchain).  There have been concerns with wallets stored with blockchain.info, since they store the encrypted wallet private keys.  If there is any weakness in their random number generator (this was a recent issue) or in their implementations of encryption of your keys, then your bitcoin might be accessed by improper parties.  Hacking usernames/passwords would unlock the keys to your bitcoin.
Breadwallet (and Mycelium/other wallet programs/apps) store the private keys on your device.  This means that the keys aren't stored on a remote and centralized system, so they are much more difficult for others to attack.  Certainly you must use safe practices on your device, but it is generally considered more secure than a cloud service, like blockchain.info, that holds this information.  It is the difference between robbing a bank (where many people store money so there is one target with huge potential rewards) or robbing individuals on the street (many targets, each with a smaller reward).
Andreas no longer works for blockchain.info, to the best of my knowledge.

And I am not positive if it was truly compliant with the standard as the new Electrum v2.0 in development has wallets that are not compatible with v1.98 (at least so far).
True BIP32 wallets also let you have branches.  Electrum v1.98 does not seem to support this (unsure if this is in v2 yet).  So, a CEO could have a wallet and create sub-branches for each department head under him, and those department heads could create subbranches and so on.  The CEO could hold the master private key for everyone in the company, but each department head could only spend from addresses generated under their own department's branch (and so on).

The nonce is often randomly generated.  A mining pool may be working on the exact same block, but other miners (or other pools) will have be working on different blocks. Reasons for this are 1) they may have a different list of transactions to confirm, and mostly 2) the transaction to reward the mining pool will be different for each pool, 3) should a miner run through all nonce values allowed, they can also adjust the timestamp field on the block and retry their nonce's.
There is no requirement that every miner in a pool work on the exact same set of transactions (some pools are entirely distributed).  Also, this is not a requirement of the Bitcoin protocol.

Are there reasons BitPay or Coinbase (or similar merchant services) could not be used?  They handle the transaction and addresses for you.
If you are concerned that customers would later send to an address they used with you, there read about HD wallets and using a master public key to allow your website to generate receiving addresses that can be linked to a single master private key that you control. Your website/app does not need to hold any private keys this way and can have 4 billion different addresses all tied to it.

You provide BitWage with a public address and in return BitWage provides you with an ACH routing and account number, which you simply provide to your employer's payroll system as an additional direct deposit account (most payroll providers allow for several accounts). You control the fixed amount or percentage allocated to this account, just as you would to a savings account versus your normal checking account.

- Speaking of Miami, just this weekend Roger Ver attended via a roaming iPad avatar and purchased a t-shirt using Bitcoin.  Roger is not even in the country but managed to place a secure transaction.
- Bob Alison sent Bitcoin to 80 people in different countries.  This took him less than 15 minutes and his transaction fees were less than $1. Every one got their bitcoin a few seconds later.
- Bitcoin has multisignature accounts, where you can secure your bitcoin by requiring you to unlock your bitcoin from multiple devices.  Online services can use this mechanism for secure escrow and to ensure the service cannot steal your bitcoin.
The price of Bitcoin will change.  Guaranteed.  The capability for secure and frictionless payments is tremendous, and works regardless of the price.

I can lock my credit cards in a vault and only take them out once to buy something online, but how that merchant secures the informtion is completely out of my control and I have no view into their procedures and processes.  I have to trust them.  I know many people who are so afraid of this that they never shop online, so what good is that doing for the economy?
We don't have that problem with Bitcoin.  The merchant can publish the sales details on the Internet (indeed the blockchain is entirely public), and that does not help a crook steal my bitcoin.
Sure, wallet security needs to improve, but it will evolve.  The user interfaces will get easier and more foolproof (although they seem to keep making better fools).

The gain or loss is calculated based on the price you bought the bitcoins at as compared to the time you made the purchase.  If the value of the bitcoin went up, you had a gain, otherwise a loss.
Note that this is the value of the amount of bitcoin used for the purchase of the item.  If you bought 1 BTC at $800 and spent 0.1 BTC to purchase an item for $20 today, you take that 0.1 BTC @ $800 ($80) and the price it sold for today ($20), for a capital loss of $60.

There is not a requirement that every block get filled to capacity.  Miners can select transactions to include in a block and they are allowed to exclude transactions with insufficient fees.
Proposals to increase the block size are being evaluated by Gavin and others, but they agree that this is not an immediate need.
If you want your transaction to confirm quickly, include a fee.  If you are just transferring between your own wallets and there is no hurry, you can skip the fee and wait for awhile or retry again at a later time.

Interesting viewpoint, but flawed.
If a customer can pay with Bitcoin, they accept Bitcoin.  Just like they accept Visa and Mastercard.
Your employer isn't paying you in USD.  They are paying you in electricity, cable TV, fuel, milk, eggs, and food, since you just convert your USD into those.  Using this argument, your employer is paying you in stocks, since they contribute to your 401k.
They let customers buy their product by paying with Bitcoin.  What they do with it after that is purely a business decision.  Just because they may convert to USD today doesn't mean they will convert 100% forever.

Great read! I remember this evolution in much the same steps and is also why Bitcoin excites me so much.
Prior to WWW there were all those clunky services written over email, much like your description of Archie to locate the file you were interested in... then you could send an email containing the server location and file name to another service (I believe MIT had one) and they would chunk up the file and send you the parts via email.  You could reassemble them and have the data you were looking for.  Our company had Internet email but not WWW, and I remember downloading Perl this way.  
Services are built to work with the tools available at the time, until more efficient tools are developed.
Oh! And I remember being in a bar and overheard two bikers exchanging email addresses so they could meet for a ride.  That was the first time I saw non-techies talking about email.

Maybe now that the people looking to make a quick buck are bailing, we can get to work building applications for programmable money.  We have multisig and escrow to reduce fraud in ways that were challenging in the past.  
A mechanism for consignment should be developed, where a payment to an address is automagically divided amongst recipients in a predetermined ratio.  The payment of an item could also trigger automatic and immediate inventory control that would be simply a side-benefit of the payment transaction.  No additional effort on anyone's part.  Perhaps even taxes (ugh) could be directed automatically to the appropriate agency.  As I understand it, this type of contract  might come with Ethereum.
Another application might be paying for digital content like music with portions of the payment getting automatically sent to the performer, author, and band.

Seriously, congratulations.  For most people, Bitcoin is a 'leap of faith' that it can even work.  As you learn about it and get more comfortable with using it (as you have demonstrated), you see that there is a better way to transact on the Internet without credit cards.
Have you spent any Bitcoin yet? There is an exhilaration from using it.  Even if it is a small amount with changetip or tipping a YouTube video or magazine article.  Contributing a small amount to charity is an entirely new feeling, since you don't have to key your credit card credentials and pray that they keep that information secure.  Imagine being able to contribute a small amount to your favorite band without needing small bills in your wallet.  The word people use is 'frictionless' transactions.

Greg, I really do appreciate the work and effort that you and others are putting into Core.  I certainly don't expect Bitcoin to ever match Visa in size or scale.
What we have is a road that allows anyone to drive on it, and it stretches around the globe.  People have homes and are building businesses along the road, and more people are starting to find reasons to use this road.  It is starting to get crowded.  In your role as city planner, you see this happening, and you and your team are making plans to build a highway, called Lightning, alongside this road.
It has taken many years for the customers to build driveways to their homes, so they can get to these businesses.  They are getting comfortable with driving the road and using it to conduct their business.  While everyone agrees that the highway is needed, they also know that they will still need to use the road to reach the highway.
The highway is clearly being built, but it is not yet available for use.  The newspapers are promoting the highway, and telling everyone how great it will be once it is built, and that it will solve all of the traffic problems when it's ready.
But it isn't ready for use yet.  People are asking for the old road to have just another lane opened, to make it easier for them to continue to conduct business as they always have.
Certainly, expanding the road will reduce congestion.  The road isn't being replaced by the highway, and it will still be needed by everyone to reach the highway.
The on and off ramps for the highway haven't been published yet.  The community does not know if the highway will be open and how far they will have to drive to reach it, or when  their destination will have access to the highway.
The traditional Bitcoin protocol is the road.  Lightning is the highway.  We have wallets and QR codes and everyone knows how to use them.  Once Lightning is built, there will need to be a massive construction project to get all of the wallets and tools created or uplifted to use it.  It is not going to be immediate, and it is not going to be without issue.  Everyone is going to need some understanding of how to use Lightning, and they will still need to use the underlying Bitcoin protocol to open and close a payment channel.  People don't know enough about Lightning to know if they will be able to make use of it, and we certainly don't know when it will be available or when the parties we transact with will be ready to use it.
So even with Lightning, there is still need for the Bitcoin protocol to allow more traffic.  That is not going to change, and it is not going to go away.  Ever.
Eventually, if things go as you expect, everything can happen on the Lightning network and it will be seamless to open and close a payment channel.  We're not there yet.  Every payment channel is still going to need the old Bitcoin protocol.
The old road, the Bitcoin protocol, will still need to be maintained even after the Lightning highway is built.  It still needs capacity boosts to handle the thousands of payment channels that will be needed, and it will continue to do so long into the future, just as the Lightning highway will also need additional lanes eventually, too.
The job as a city planner is not easy.  Simply increasing the tolls to use the road is not going to reduce traffic, now that everyone knows that they can transact securely and easily.  It will reduce some traffic, and many will be pushed to other roads.  There are many ways to scale.
I see Classic as a project that will add the extra lane to the road, while Lightning and other improvements are built.  I do not see them as competition.
You probably saw the recent conversation between Samourai Wallet and Mycelium: You develop functionality A, I will develop functionality B and we will share with each other.  Very powerful.  Maybe that same lesson can apply to Core and Classic.  Let one maintain the old road while the other builds the highway.  There are plenty of on/off ramps that will need cooperation, ideas, and assistance from both teams.  Everyone will benefit in the long run.
This is not a competition.

Normally you are only reading DNS and not updating it.
DNS updates for new domains can only be propagated from a small number of central DNS servers (13) and then out to the world. Changes to DNS take hours and even days to reach some places.  10 minutes is FAST!
You actually get some decent validation simply by getting your transaction accepted by the Bitcoin network, before confirmation.  Certainly not enough to trust a significant purchase, but certainly enough to not worry about the price of a sandwich.  If this becomes a common exploit, it will get fixed in short time.

There is a significant amount of innovation surrounding Bitcoin, as well as growing adoption.  Certainly this is no guarantee or requirement that Bitcoin will be THE cryptocurrency, but it has a significant head start.
To some extent this may help Litecoin and other altcoins (e.g. a payment system that supports Bitcoin might not find it difficult to accommodate other altcoins).  However, there is also much innovation that is specific to Bitcoin that won't/can't apply to the other altcoins.  It will depend on the specific properties built into the altcoin.

For one, it is no longer 'cold storage' since the private key has been loaded into a (possibly comprimised) network attached device.  Nothing wrong with Mycelium (I use it, too), but can you ever be certain the phone does not have a keylogger or other virus?  It would not be advisable to keep your life savings on that same paper wallet.
Purists also like HD (heirarchical deterministic) wallets where spare change is directed to a new public address (rather than back to the paper wallet's address).  Some of this is for privacy and some is concern that one day someone might figure out how to derive the private key from the signature and public address.  Albeit a very very low possibility and probability today, it is considered by some as a risk.
Create a fresh paper wallet using cold storage practices and you won't have these worries.

He defrauded a business partner of Reddit.  If you write a check (for those outside the US, it's a written IOU that can be exchanged for fiat at a bank) and don't have sufficient funds, but received the merchandise, that is called fraud.
A double spend as he described is no different, other than he used bitcoin instead of paper.  Coinbase is out $10.  While they have the ability to check for double spends, it is still on him for actually using the technique.  
He sent Coinbase a transaction that was not valid.  Same as writing a check then putting a 'stop payment' on it.  Fraud.

Getting the ACH/Routing number made this so easy to hook into my company's direct deposit system.  They don't even know it is for bitcoin.
The best part is that the bitcoin gets deposited directly to a wallet address I provide (they also let you provide an HD wallet xpub, so each week they generate another address in my wallet).  Much easier for me to be my own bank and manage my own private keys.  With Coinbase, I find myself going to their system and sending coins to my own wallet.  BitWage has been really great.

Staying with small blocks means that transactions have to 'compete' to get confirmed, and the transactions with the largest fee will get approved first.  For the past years, we've enjoyed very low fees ($0.05 or less), but as more people start using bitcoin, they will need to increase their fee in order to get the transaction included in a block.  If you have to pay $5 to get your transaction confirmed, then it will become cost prohibitive for many users.
If your paper wallet only stores $5 and you have to pay that towards fees in order to spend/transfer it, your bitcoin essentially becomes worthless.  Now, keep in mind the exchange rate of bitcoin will also change.  If it costs more to transact, there will may be fewer people willing to pay the fees unless there are compelling and offsetting reasons to use bitcoin.

Where is this Lightning Network you talk about? Which wallets are using it? Which merchants accept it? Where are the users?
It is going to take YEARS for Lightning to make a difference.  Look at the meager number of merchants that accept bitcoin today, after all these years.  Are they going to instantly move to LN the moment it's released?  It will take a long time for that to come to fruition in any meaningful way.
The big block side wants to enable LN, too.  But we can't keep a cap on blocksize for years until it is available and adopted.

There was a time when a fixed 2MB increase would have been acceptable.  That was a year ago, when everyone expected a solution would be delivered by April 2016 and a 2MB proposal shortly after that.
Since then, the transaction backlog and fee 'market' has shown us a bitcoin network that cannot keep up with demand.  There is poor user experience and it is difficult to explain to newcomers why this great technology is failing them.
The past few years have been too painful for the community, and no one wants to start another multi-year battle to get to 4MB.  BU proposes a way to end the block size war permanently.

If the demand (number of transactions) exceeds the fixed block size, then everyone is forced to pay constantly increasing and unpredictable fees.  There is no way to ever see fees decrease, unless the demand decreases.  And it **will** decrease, as everyone will move to another payment option.  And that is **everyone**.
An expanding blocksize can keep fees relatively constant and predictable, since it can adjust the blocks according to demand.
We're already seeing several bitcoin merchants and exchanges this week indicate the pain the fees are causing them, forcing them to relieve the fee pressure by cutting off payment options (for BitPay, now $1 minimum, for other VPN's we saw them cut out weekly plans).
With fixed block size, bitcoin will fail miserably.  It will fail if people cannot transact with it for a fee less than credit cards (and other payment options).

How long will it take once SegWit is available for wallets to start separating the witness data from the transactions?  How long will it take once Lightning is available for every wallet and tool to take advantage of payment channels?

What is a 'Malicious miner'?  The incentives in bitcoin are that miners earn money by running equipment that uses energy.
If a miner were to sabotage bitcoin, then they also lose their financial investment in equipment.  If the miner had enough hashing power to cause significant problems, they would lose their investment in equipment.  
The incentives reward them for good behavior.

Unlike the past 2 years, the hard fork will resolve itself pretty quickly.  Unlike ETH/ETC, the difficulty computation only happens in bitcoin every 2016 blocks (about 2 weeks).  If 75% of the mining power is running BU, then it may take as long as 8 weeks for the remaining Core miners to reach the next difficulty adjustment.  Those 25% of miners would probably rather make money changing to BU, than waste the electricity.
If Core rolls out a patch to reset the difficulty, this is a hard fork, so it invalidates their concerns over hard forks (and they could have done one 2 years ago).

BU sees Flexible Transactions as a malleability fix that is not as complex as SegWit.  The BU folks also want to see this fixed and they support LN, but they want to give LN more time to be implemented.
Even if the malleability fix were implemented today, it will take a long time for LN to be available to the masses.  It's taken us 9 years just to get bitcoin merchant adoption to the low level of support it has today.  It will take at least as long for LN to be understood and adopted by merchants, users, wallet software, and hubs.
BU is proposing that we grow the block size now, to give the network some breathing room to get LN implemented safely, and not rushed too quickly.

A few weeks ago, Coinbase had a post indicating that they are testing BitcoinXT (aka BIP101).  The company is performing its due diligence should XT be adopted, as they are likely testing other code (I certainly hope they are on top of things).  The big change in XT is that it has support for larger blocks (which have a fixed max of 1M in length) to enable the bitcoin network to handle more transactions.  Certainly, many feel that more capacity is good for the protocol.
There are others who feel that this was a slap to the current Bitcoin Core implementation that is keeping 1M blocks.  Since some of the moderators of also maintain bitcoin.org, they removed mention of Coinbase from that website.
A change request was submitted to add Coinbase back to the website.  However, even with 95% support, the maintainers of the site have failed to act.

Old node software cannot fully validate SegWit transactions as the 'witness' is separated from the addresses.  That is not desirable for the long-term health of the network as old software simply says "oh... ok... whatever" without really performing validation.

back to my earlier point: Where is LN? How soon will my wallet be able to use it? How long before my merchants adopt it?
LN is at best a few years away from adoption.  We have already practically stalled gaining merchants and hardly any of the user growth we were experiencing.  We've made relatively little technical progress in the past 2 years, while everyone has been waiting for a solution to the block issues.
Sure, I would use LN if it were feasible.  It just is not an option that will be available for quite awhile yet.

I am not anti-Lightning, although I admit I do not understand all of the nuances about it.
So even if Lightning capabilities are rolled out today, there is still a long tail required for developers to make wallets/services/tools/education available to everyone to start a payment channel and transact on it.  
It's taken 7 years to get where we are today with Bitcoin, and we are just starting to see some better tools for non-technical users.
Again, I am not discounting Lightning as a solution to enable higher transaction volumes, but once people understand it, there will be a long period before it can be integrated into new/existing services.
edit: SegWit also requires significant changes to wallet software and merchant software before we will see any relief for full blocks.

Implementing it as a soft fork can happen rather quickly and pretty safely.  
From a design perspective, maybe there will be other (perhaps better) uses for the space SW uses in the coinbase transaction.  But, we already know that a hard fork will eventually be needed for scaling the block size, and at that time, moving the data from the coinbase transaction to somewhere else in the header would be also be tackled.
Since nearly everyone has to be ready for the hard fork to trigger, we would have greater confidence that it will succeed and could implement several cleanup tasks.  As an app designer, sometimes it is better to deploy quickly and fix the technical debt later.  As long as it gets fixed eventually.

I use both BitWage and Coinbase/Swift.  There are certainly other options.  I think BitPay may have a debit card offering, too.  From their website, BitPay indicates you can get payroll deposit available on your card (have not tried their service yet).
BitWage does not offer a debit card, however there are several options recently.   They receive the payroll information and convert it into bitcoin sent to a public address you control (they don't ever see the private keys, so this is great).
Swift debit card uses Coinbase as the source for your bitcoin funds.  I think the problem here is that Coinbase does not give you a permanent bitcoin address for your account with them (so you don't want to use an address Coinbase gives you for your recurring payroll deposit).
A good option, in my opinion, is to have BitWage deposit to an address on a wallet you have full control over.  When you want to add funds to your Shift debit card, go on Coinbase's site and send some amount of bitcoin to the address they display for you.
Just like a cash bank account, you probably don't want to store all of your bitcoin in an account with a debit card, as the consumer protections in case someone gets your card info is not as good as a credit card.

A full node doesn't need to connect to every node, just a few random nodes.  Your node can validate that you are getting the same message from the others, and your node is also performing validation on the signatures and content of blocks they are passing you (before you pass them along to others).  If the transactions and/or blocks are consistent between everyone you are talking to, you can be sufficiently confident that you are getting accurate information.
While it is certainly possible that one or more nodes you are talking to is lying, as long as you are randomly selecting who you talk to, you can be mostly confident that you are getting accurate data.  If someone keeps giving you bad or inconsistent information, you disconnect from them.  This logic is built in to the application.
Eventually you will get a view consistent with the majority of the entire network.

Have you ever used the Bitcoin Core wallet?  Having to synchronize everything before you can transact is not user-friendly.  SPV wallets remove this delay and pain.

They also support the Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets.

It may be a little confusing in that they offer payroll services to 1) individuals, so you can receive a portion of your earnings in bitcoin, or 2) companies that want to pay wages in bitcoin.  And, 3)  BitWage also offers job hunting services for those wanting to earn bitcoin. 
As an individual (option 1), you provide some personal information and they will assign you a bank routing and account number.  You provide BitWage with one or more of your public addresses (or an xpub key).  Take the bank routing numbers provided by BitWage and add this account to your company's payroll system (most allow you to direct a flat amount or percentage of your pay to several bank accounts) and that's it.  Every time your company does payroll, that amount goes to this bank account and BitWage will deposit the bitcoin to one of your public addresses.
Your employer only sees an additional bank account and does not know that this is an account for buying bitcoin.  A great advantage is that they only ever get the public address for your bitcoin holdings, and they don't have the private key needed to spend them.  So, your bitcoin is quite safe.  Better than Coinbase and others that hold the private keys for you.
If you are an employer (option 2), you can set up payroll services with BitWage and allow your employees to take a portion of their pay in bitcoin.  The rest of it works much the same (employees provide their public addresses) to option 1.
In either case, since your company's payroll system already took out income tax before depositing money to your BitWage account, there is no extra income tax on the bitcoin.  Every pay day, you automatically get some of your pay in bitcoin.  Very simple and painless.
Note that the normal IRS rules apply in that you are supposed to report capital gains/losses when you sell those bitcoin, but that has nothing to do with BitWage.

No, but 75 satoshi at today's price won't be profitable for a miner to secure the network, but if the price increases accordingly, it will.
We had lots of FUD prior to the halving this summer that miners were going to shut down and close shop, but instead the price increased to make the smaller reward more than sufficient.
Most arguments talking about smaller mining rewards in the future treat it like the value is constant.  It is provably not so and is by design.

I completely agree, and it makes for a regulatory burden on consumers and businesses having different treatments for the same thing.  This comes up in discussion every time one of the three agencies makes a statement, but the reality is that each agency can indeed have a different interpretation.
I am not sure how we can get them to agree on a single view of bitcoin, since we as a community can't agree if it is a settlement token, an investment, a property, or electronic cash.  And different cryptocurrencies have attributes that align better with several of those characteristics than others, so there is no one definition that will fit all.
It may be awhile before the dust settles on this topic, and it will have to come from congress and the courts.

Incentive is altruistic for some (donate back to help validate Bitcoin activity), privacy for some (they can scan the block chain for their personal transaction activity without sending that activity to unknown/untrusted nodes), and mining for others (confirm new blocks in hope of claiming the block reward).

Sidechains do require the use of bitcoin, as the exchange rate of bitcoin to sidecoin units would be pegged at a constant level. Much like casino chips, the casino can create more chips, but they cannot create more than the cash they were coined to represent. Using the casino example, if 1 red chip = $0.25, the casino can't suddenly give you $1.00 for one, as they would be creating money.  The exchange rate is constant, so the sidechain cannot create new coins of its own.
Although I am not familiar with the specifics, a sidechain coin could probably be worth less than a satoshi, but this may not be desirable, since you could not convert back to bitcoin except in a quantity of sidechain coins.

I stand corrected, 'reversed' was not the proper word.  The transactions on the shorter chain are added back to the mempool.  If the transaction is found to be in the longer chain, it will be removed from the mempool since it was already confirmed.

XT does not prohibit Lightning, it just delays the urgency (and allows it come out of the vapor and to be thoroughly tested).
When demand causes the need, it will take much time for everyone to implement the one-time code increase.  XT will kick in the ability to validate larger blocks 2 weeks after 75% consensus, which seems reasonable.

To be determined.  It is likely that the exchanges will follow the big-blocks fork, since the trigger is that 75% of the last 1000 mined blocks are supportive of the change.
If an exchange wanted to follow the small-blocks chain, they would run their own nodes and/or connect only to nodes following that chain.  Today, all nodes are on the same chain.
@_date: 2015-08-18 18:37:04
You can change the soft limit on the block size in your mining software as you see fit.  
At some point after the fork, the shorter chain will be abandoned, per the protocol rules.  Transactions mined on the shorter chain will go back to the mempool for re-processing (if they were not already mined on the longer chain).
If XT comes nowhere near getting the required 75% consensus, there will be no fork and you can laugh at the people who wrote it.

All of the keys that were in your wallet at the time of the export are safe (as stated elsewhere, many extras are also generated).  The non-HD wallets generate their keys at random, so if you don't perform periodic exports, you risk losing some of the keys.
You should periodically get a fresh export of the wallet.
While HD wallets (Electrum 2.x, Mycelium 2.x, and others) generate fresh keys from a master seed value, the one seed can be used to restore all of the keys associated with the seed (a great reason to store the seed in a very safe location).  For an HD wallet, one backup is forever.

I second the Mycelium option. 
For any option, you can give the staff 'watch only' public addresses, so they can accept bitcoin but not spend them.  They can generate a QR code for the customer to include the purchase amount and tip, so the customer just needs to scan the QR code and confirm the total transaction amount.
If a refund needs to be issued (overpayment, etc) then the staff will need to get you (or a manager who also has a spending key to a wallet), but this is not much different than the manager key needed to issue a refund at a cash register.

So they are providing the ability to upload a list of up to 100 public addresses where payments will be sent, and they will work through the list in sequence.  Once they hit the end of the list, all payments go to the last address until new addresses are added.
While this seems like a perfect use for xpub master public keys, the article indicates that there are several different implementations of BIP32 and BitWage doesn't want to see all of your addresses (and have access to see all of your activity with that wallet).  So this is probably a better option for now.
The benefit of doing this by list is that I have full control of where my bitcoin wages are sent, and I have the control to spread this across multiple wallets (one payday it goes to my Mycelium wallet, the next payday it goes to my Trezor wallet, ...).
So there are advantages of working from a list rather than xpub.

There is an upper bound to the size of a single transaction (just like there is a limit to the size of a block of transactions). The larger the transaction, the higher the fees.  The upper limit on the fee is the amount of bitcoin used as inputs (assuming no output addresses) which would make the miner very happy.

Well, restaurants I have been to that use Square (dongles for a smart phone that scan credit cards) still provide a bill to my table from the POS system.  I would imagine that the merchant would keep those paid with bitcoin separate and balance at the end of the night/shift.  After all, the bitcoin blockchain is a ledger of every transaction, so that would be your mechanism for balancing.  Mycelium would also give the staff member AND the manager a detailed transaction history right on their phone.  The staff member could just write the first few characters of the transaction id on the receipt.

If you are interested in diversifying your investments, you can use BitWage.co, where they provide a bank routing/account number you can link to your payroll deposit at work (looks like another bank account to your employer, and most let you link several accounts and indicate a flat amount or percentage to allocate).  Then on BitWage's website, you supply a public address where they will deposit the bitcoin.  Every time you get paid, you will be buying some bitcoin.  It's convenient and more of a set-it-and-forget-it thing.  So, buy $20 each pay.
To your more general question about 'why': Using bitcoin is a 'push' technology, where you (and Coinbase, since they are your wallet provider) hold the only keys to unlock your spending.  A traditional credit card requires you to provide all of your identity information to every merchant so they can ask Visa for payment, which means that everyone has your credentials and you have to trust that they will use them properly and store them securely.  Credit cards are really a backwards mechanism when you think about it (why they have so many problems securing the system).  With Bitcoin, you don't need to give your credentials to every merchant, you just use your credentials to unlock your wallet and send the payment TO them.  All they see is public information.
It is really nice donating $1 worth of bitcoin to a charity, or tipping someone on Reddit/Twitter/FB, because you don't need to enter any personal information and there is no worry that they are going to misuse your credit card credentials.  Bitcoin puts you in complete control of your spending.

Agree fully with and want to add to extend the point on large block verification: If there is no hard limit, then a disruptive miner could publish a block too large for most nodes to download and validate each transaction in a reasonable time.  If a full node cannot validate the block\, they cannot propagate it to other nodes and other miners.  An completely unlimited block size may also exceed other capabilities of their machine (memory, CPU, etc.).  So, some type of hard limit is necessary for technical reasons.

The best (probably not 100% accurate) comparison for Lightning is that it is similar to a gift card, only the balance is refundable at the end of a predefined period (days, weeks, ...), and the gift card might be usable at several merchants.  These are still bitcoin transactions, only they don't hit the Bitcoin blockchain for every transaction (only to send bitcoin to the payment channel and to close it).  This allows for more microtransactions, where any individual transaction might be for an amount smaller than the bitcoin transaction fees.  When accumulated over the period, these small amounts aggregate into a payment worthy of the bitcoin transaction fees.
A sidechain is a conversion into some other unit of value, that has a constant exchange rate to/from Bitcoin.  So, you might be able to buy 1500 units of X-coin per bitcoin, and transact in those outside the bitcoin network.  When you want to redeem them back into bitcoin, the same 1500 units/bitcoin rate still applies (bitcoin are neither created or destroyed by the exchange).  These allow other characteristics and behaviors than might be feasible in the bitcoin protocol, such as fast confirmations or some such.  At this time, my understanding is that the mechanism to ensure the fixed exchange rate is not ready (failure to do so means bitcoin might be created from nothing).
Hope this helps!
edit: Riplin is correct that litecoin or dogecoin can't run on a sidechain (as they mine new coins), but there could be a sidechain with similar characteristics to those that simply doesn't create new coins.

Not a shill.  It just works.  You provide some personal information so they can match your payroll provider's data  and they give you a normal bank routing/account number.  Plug that in your HR system as you would any other direct deposit bank account and allocate the amount for that account (most payroll systems allow a percentage or fixed dollar amount).  I recommend starting with just a few dollars the first pay, just to make sure its working, then adjust the amount later.
You also give Bitwage a xpub key (or some public addresses) and they will rotate which one is used each pay.  Very easy.
The day after the payroll hits, you get an email telling you your bitcoin has been sent right to your wallet.  For even more privacy, you can disable the amounts/address being included in the email notification.  I really like that.  Other exchanges (looking at you Coinbase) should provide an option to disable listing addresses and amounts in their emails.
edit: words
@_date: 2016-02-26 02:22:31
One of the things I really like about BitWage is that the coins go directly to an address in whatever wallet I want.  I can provide an xpub and they automatically deposit to the next public address.  I own the keys and have more privacy (yes, they know some of my identity info, but not as much as Coinbase), but they don't have my private keys.
I would think Coinbase could do this if they want to reduce their wallet business.

Death by a thousand cuts.
I understand that I need to pay the bitcoin mining fee (1) to open the channel and someone pays fee (3) to close the channel.   If each day I transact on the channel, am I also paying a relay fee (2), or is it a one-time thing?  I realize fee (2) may be optional or may be much less than a bitcoin mining fee, but it still needs to be paid out of my channel.
So is it cheaper to pay fees (1) + (3) + (N x 2), or just (N x 1) to transact directly on the bitcoin network?

The way I understand it, fees with Lightning can come from (at least) three places:
1. User pays a bitcoin transaction fee to miners to open a channel
2. Lightning relays can charge a relay fee (is this per channel or per transaction?)
3. A bitcoin transaction fee goes to miners to close the channel (who pays this fee)?
If the user is paying all of the fees, then this is a non-starter.

They would need the private key(s) or master private key (for an HD wallet).  These are simply a long string of characters.  Ideally, to avoid these keys being used prematurely, you could put these keys in a file and split it into many pieces (see Shamir's Secret Sharing) which lets you split a file into N pieces and indicate that at least M pieces are necessary to create the original file.  
So, you if you have 5 trusted family members, you might split the file into 5 pieces where 3 of the family members would need to cooperate to restore the file.  Your lawyer and/or executor may also hold a piece.  Hopefully 3 is large enough and the friends trusted enough to not put their pieces together until the appropriate time.

This is very new technology, so it is very difficult to determine.
Generic blockchain technology has properties that will help businesses, such as immutability and distributed management of data (everyone has a read-only copy of the data).  While these may be permissioned blockchains (you must be part of the authorized group to publish transactions, while anyone with bitcoin can write to the bitcoin blockchain), the ability for everyone to have a copy of all the data is beneficial (e.g. if any one copy becomes inaccessible, every other copy can still be used and updated).
We're in the early days of this technology.  It certainly seems that there will be many uses for it across many industries.

For the purpose of the IRS, you need to do some accounting.  A bit of a pain, but not terrible.
First, you need to track the number of bitcoin and the USD price at the time.  Keep these in a spreadsheet or something.  Coinbase/Circle probably provide reports of this information.  In stocks, these purchases are referred to as 'lots'.
When you sell bitcoin or buy some item using bitcoin, track the number of bitcoin spent and the USD exchange rate ($100 today would be roughly 0.44 bitcoin, but that exchange rate changes often).
Track that bitcoin sale against the oldest lot.  Subtract the cost of those bitcoin (0.44 bitcoin in my example) at the exchange rate when they were purchased from the price at the time of sale ($100) and you can calculate the capital gains (if the exchange rate is higher today) or loss (if the exchange rate today is lower).
Since Coinbase/Circle provide reports, the work may be done for you (although you do not have a taxable event if you moved bitcoin between wallets you own).
If you choose to use your own wallet all of the transactions are stored on the blockchain, so you just need to track your addresses and determine the exchange rate at the time of the transactions.  You will still need to track purchases as 'lots'.

The merchant can configure the percentage they want to hold in their payment processor (BitPay/Coinbase/etc.), so we don't have much insight to this.  Many small online shops have stated on that they hold 100%.  Overstock.com has publicly stated that they hold a good percentage of the bitcoin they receive and invest a portion back into the Bitcoin community.
Since cash/credit transactions are still a larger portion of payments for these merchants, they can often afford to hold the relatively small amount of bitcoin they take in.
My personal opinion is a major milestone will  be the merchant-to-supplier payments.  Since the merchants often pay their suppliers via credit card and those suppliers pay their suppliers via credit card, those 3-4%'s add up quickly throughout the supply chain.

Yes, they are reputable.  Their website steps you through the process.  Basically, they match you with a seller, based on banks you can get to in your area and the amount of bitcoin you are trying to purchase.  The seller puts the bitcoin in escrow with BitQuick and the website provides details so you can deposit cash to the sellers account.  Provide a copy of the deposit receipt to BitQuick.co and they release the bitcoin to you.

Certainly the public addresses are available on the blockchain.  However... it is one thing to have to provide all the KYC/AML information to these exchanges and expect that they are being tracked and reported.  That is their business and perhaps compliance requirement.  Whatever.
It is not acceptable to publish the detail of every transaction to my email provider, who is also supposed to store and track my email conversations.  My payment details do not need to be part of that message.
This provides identity links outside the scope of 'need to know'.
GPG signing, as OP suggested, or simply using generic messages 'A transaction was received" or "A transaction was sent from your account" would be entirely sufficient if I opt-in to them. Details like address and amounts do not need to be part of that content.
If any naysayers want their credit card company to send your statement details over email, then go have fun with that.  Many of us do not want or need that detail in our inbox, exposing that information to more parties that were not involved in the transaction.
The other solution, of course, is to use your own wallet.  However, the details of transactions to/from the exchange are still provided to my mail provider.  This is not desirable.
@_date: 2015-04-27 13:58:28
Let's look at the consumer angle: 1) Credit cards largely need consumer protections because the credit card system cannot be secured - with a few pieces of information, anyone can submit charges to your account,  2) online purchasing from untrusted sellers
With bitcoin, (1) isn't a problem as the consumer controls their private key and the merchant/others don't access it, (2) we have multi-signature and escrow.
So, with bitcoin, many of the consumer benefits from credit cards are simply no longer necessary.

You don't need to sell the bitcoin for cash to make a taxable event. If you purchased something with bitcoin, the price you sold them for, less the price you purchased them for, generates a capital gain or loss event.
If you simply held the bitcoin, there is no taxable event.

If there was a marketing campaign for Bitcoin, there should be emphasis on the fact that you always maintain control of your private credentials with Bitcoin.  The very nature of credit cards leads to this severe vulnerability (I read that $150 billion per year is spent on credit card fraud).

Electrum is a Heirarchically Deterministic (HD) wallet.  This means that the words they provide for backup are used to generate a master key from which all of the wallet's private keys and public addresses can be computed.  Those words are your backup for all addresses in that wallet, now and forever.
Prior to HD wallets, private keys were generated in a completely random fashion, which meant that additional addresses would require a fresh backup to be performed.

The script contains the public keys (can derive the public addresses from them), the number of signatures required.  The identify of the owners of those public keys would still need to be verified out of band with the transaction.
I can see this being useful to ensure it is not a 3 of 5 script with the seller owning three of the keys.  However, tying identity to the keys is still an issue (certainly, signing messages helps, but does not prove/disprove identity of the owner, simply that they own the private key).

The 'smarts' in the Internet are at the endpoints.  Your browser knows how to render a web page (and features are added to the browsers all the time), but the underlying Internet protocol for transmission, tcp, does not understand HTTP.  So TCP can be smart at routing, but it does not have intelligence about the applications that use it.  No changes are needed to TCP to add a feature that a browser can render.  Mesh networks know how to route traffic between nodes, but they don't interpret content they are carrying, so any web browser should still work on a mesh network.
The landline phone network, in his example, has the smarts in the network  to perform routing, accounting and call forwarding, and the endpoints are dumb devices that have a keypad/dial, speaker and microphone.  The phone doesn't have any intelligence about call forwarding and you have to use tricks, like  to tell the phone network that you want to forward calls to another number. The phone network records that change and acts on it, not the phone.  To add a new feature requires changes to the phone company's network.

Classic wallets generated their private keys completely randomly.  This required users to backup their wallets frequently, since the new keys needed to be backed up as well as the old keys.  Quite a few people who lost their computer restored the wallet from an old backup and found that they lost the newer private keys that had been added since the backup.
HD, Heirarchically Deterministic, wallets generate a single random seed (also called the 'master private key') when the wallet is created.  All of the other private keys (and the corresponding public addresses) the wallet will use are generated from that single base.  A backup done when the wallet was created can be used even years later to restore all of the addresses generated from that same seed.  
An HD wallet also has the concept of a 'master public key'.  This can be used on a website, for example, to generate all of the public addresses, but cannot generate the private keys for those addresses.  This makes the master public key very useful and very secure.  You can store the master public key in your website and issue a unique payment address for every customer.  You can give the master public key to your accountant and they can track your transactions and balances without giving them any ability to spend your bitcoin.
Another variant is BIP44 HD wallets.  These allow you to create subaccounts.  Each subaccount has its own master private key and master public key.  If a corporation were to implement this strategy, the various vice presidents could be issued a unique subaccount for their part of the company.  Each department head under them could be issued a subaccount under their VP's, and each team could even have their own subaccount under their department head.  The VP would be able to regenerate and spend from their subaccount and any generated underneath it, and the master public key for their subaccount could see all of the activity for their subaccount.  A department head could only spend bitcoin under their subaccount, and a team could only spend bitcoin from addresses under their subaccount.  It is a very powerful concept that has potential to change accounting for an organization.

The electricity used by the bitcoin network is miniscule compared to the electricty needed to power the traditional banking networks, with every bank requiring huge data centers around the world, numerous huge office buildings for their workers (who expend fuel getting to work each day).  The number of branch offices that burn electricity every day so customers can expend fuel just to walk in the door, or leave the engine running while at the ATM.  The energy to build the armored trucks that burn fuel moving fiat from place to place. 
Bitcoin moves electrons and validates calculations.  No one has to use gas to move it from point A to point B. Office buildings occupied by bitcoin companies are smaller and often occupy a small portion of an office building (not the entire building).
The traditional banking system is incredibly inefficient, yet we are so used to it we tend to ignore it.

Those that mine are often either have deep pockets or got in early an have incrementally upgraded their equipment.  We're seeing some chip manufacturers mine with their newest equipment while it is still the fastest, then selling it off when the next generation chips are developed.  This puts hobby miners at a distinct disadvantage.
There are concerns that mining power will consolidate (read about 51% attacks), but as long as miners are accepting all transactions fairly, this may not cause problems.  The concern is that a group with a majority of mining power could decide to not include certain transactions into blocks or prefer some transactions over others (e.g. "We recognize this address as belonging to XYZ and we won't include it in the blocks that we mine").

There is a transaction malleability attack going on, where someone has their node rewriting transactions (they cannot change the inputs or outputs, just the transaction hashid is changing).  This is why you are seeing duplicate transactions.  One will confirm and one will stay in limbo.
As you have noted, you can see the duplicate transaction on the Transaction tag.  Highlight the unconfirmed transaction and press the 'Show Details' button. When it asks if you want to Cancel or Rebroadcast the transaction, select the Cancel button.
This should resolve everything.  If there are still issues, switch to another tab (e.g. Balance) then back to Transactions and select 'Reload Account' from the side menu.  This will re-download the transaction history for the account.

The xpub provides a way to generate all of the public addresses in the wallet.  The transaction balances are obtained from the blockchain.
Even an offline wallet has no concept of balance or of unspent transaction outputs.  It has no concept, as you might with a manual checking account register, of the transactions that have been signed by it.  The online portion of the wallet (containing the xpub key) would see the transaction only once it has been submitted, after having been signed by the offline wallet.

Mining equipment is quite expensive and there is not a guarantee of making a profit.
If you want to obtain some Bitcoin to experience them, you can link your bank account with Coinbase or Circle (in the US), find a Bitcoin ATM, or use another peer-to-peer service like BitQuick.co or localbitcoins.com.

Show a transaction with someone in the class (who has a pre-installed wallet to save time).  Instant transfer of value.
I like to include stories, like the guy who was at a bar in France and his beer was paid for with bitcoin by a friend in Miami.  Or the comparative ease of setting up a multi-sig account (2-of-3 wallet for kid's allowance... mom OR dad have to also approve spending) or an organization or group that stores funds in bitcoin multi-sig so one party can't run off with everyone's funds.  These would normally require a business-class bank account (and significant fees).  Multi-sig escrow accounts to protect online purchases.
Also, how a merchant can have 'receive only' public addresses in his website/store, so the bitcoin cannot be stolen even if the website was hacked or store was robbed, so the escrow agent only gets paid if their services are needed.
The bitcoin fuel pump, where the pump was unlocked by sending bitcoin to the pump's public address, so when junior runs out of gas in the middle of the night, dad can say "Send me a pic of the QR code and I will unlock it for you. Don't wake me up when you get home."

If a country creates their own cryptocurrency, it will take a long time for it to be accepted outside their borders (special infrastructure will be needed for each cryptocurrency in many devices and at many points to provide security). 
Bitcoin has already solved that problem, and being independent of any nation makes it much more neutral for global trade.
Certainly governments are reluctant to adopt Bitcoin because they have little power to control or manipulate it.  This also helps it be a good candidate for for global trade.
Some people claim that the 10 minute confirmations are a problem, but realistically, Visa/MasterCard/PayPal have 180 day confirmation period (since they can reverse transactions that far back).

There is a transaction malleability attack going on right now. Your bitcoin are completely safe, it is simply that the transactions are being rewritten (with no change to the inputs or outputs possible) assigning a new transaction id.  One will get confirmed and one will be flagged as a possible double spend.
This is annoying, but not putting your bitcoin at risk.

The point is apparently to cause uncertainty.
The impact is that you should wait for a confirmation before spending the output from a transaction.  Using OP's example, if you submitted the original transaction with id 2000 and built a second transaction immediately spending the outputs from transaction 2000 before it is confirmed, and the transaction id that gets confirmed is changed to 2001, your second transaction will be invalid.
Just be patient and wait a few minutes for a confirmation before building the second transaction.

Credit processors also have to deal with fraud, where with bitcoin the person transferring the value is provably in control of the credentials.  Certainly someone can steal a private key, but it is much more difficult with 256-bits than with 16 characters (where at least 8 are the same for each bank).
Settlement with bitcoin is nearly instant and presents no risk to the merchant.  Credit card payments can be reversed even 180 days after the transaction date.

Yes.  The wallet seed generates the private key (needed to sign spending transactions).  From the private key a public key is generated through some various functions. From the public key is generated the public address, which is the bitcoin address you commonly see (starts with a '1' for normal addresses and '3' for advanced features like multisig).  Normally you only ever see the public address as the wallet should handle the private/public keys behind the scenes.  Your public address is much like an email address in that someone needs to know this in order to send bitcoin to you.  The private key is used to sign transactions (with the public key) to show that you control the key and are allowed to spend coins sent to the public address.  While you can share the public address with everyone, the private key should never be shared with anyone (again, the functionality is hidden inside Mycelium for your convenience).
@_date: 2015-10-21 22:56:04
I've been using it for several months and it works great.  It's no fuss and I provided several of my public addresses, so they spread the payments around to a different address each pay day, so all my coins aren't in one place.  They provide an ACH routing and account number and you enter it in your payroll's system at work as any other bank account.  Try it with a small amount the first payroll cycle, just to ensure everything is working.  Our payroll system at work lets me indicate the amount (percentage, flat amount, or whatever) to be directed each pay day.
For the convenience of having the coin in my own wallet each pay day, it is really great.

The 12-word seed is all you need to restore the keys to your wallet and it is yours to keep in a safe place.  The transaction history and balance are stored in the cloud on the blockchain.  But the seed is the important part for you to be able to recover your bitcoin should you lose the phone or something.  All of the keys for all of the accounts can be recovered from those 12 words (Mycelium lets you create several accounts, so you can separate types of spending).  Each time you spend from an account it will automatically create a new address. This is intentional and is good for privacy, so don't be surprised when this happens.  Be sure to set a PIN and remember it!  But those 12 words hold the keys to you being able to spend any bitcoin you receive.

I think it is more of trusting the phone makers and the carriers to secure the devices.  Other than reputation, they don't have sufficient incentive.

@_date: 2015-02-09 18:52:15
A couple options:
1) Use master public keys (an HD wallet feature) so you can generate unique and secure addresses for your wallet. Since the vending machine only needs this master public key, there is not a private key in the machine, so hacks won't get anywhere.  
Each vending machine owner can hold the BIP44 master keys to all the machines he owns.  Electrum 2.02beta is using HD multisig wallets (but not BIP44 accounts) allowing several 'owners' to sign any spending transaction from the machine's income.
You can have the pi check various API services like blockchain.info, toshi.io to look for the displayed address for unconfirmed transactions.  The more services you poll, the better the chance of a double-spend.  While a risk, it seems hardly worth the effort for a $2 candy bar.  Certainly be aware the services can become unresponsive or fail to update, so some logic will be needed the detect and work around that.
2) BIP70 may present some alternatives, where a web server (not in the vending machine) presents the payment request and can then notify the machine securely when a payment is received and trigger the item to dispense.  A random nonce would need to be sync'd between the machine and the website but allows your website code to check more full nodes to prevent double spends.  This also allows you to update and scale the the Internet server without touching each vending machine.

On an Android phone, Mycelium works well. They also have a testnet version and it will let you obtain testnet bitcoins (worth nothing, but great for getting used to the ideas).  Even using the mainnet version (real bitcoins) of Mycelium is fine for the amount you are talking about. Plus you can have them with you when you find someone who accepts Bitcoin.

Capitalism used to be about remaining competitive, and having competition makes everyone more efficient.  A portion of profits gained from this productivity go back into improving your business to be more competitive.
We hit 'good enough' and all the competitors stopped investing in research and began pocketing those profits.  Entire industries just stopped improving, yet they continue to drain the profits from their businesses.  They may be able to keep the business running with fewer people, but that comes with a price tag of agility (the failure to adapt) as there is no one allocated to improvement and testing new methods.  Certainly there is little tolerance within many companies for those people who present new and risky ideas.
The research is coming from outside innovation, and it is easier for incumbents to protect profits by lobbying against the newcomers than it is to invest in actually improving their business, since that reduces profits.  
However, the dinosaurs will still not adapt and newcomers will find ways to survive (either within or apart from) the regulatory boundaries.

Cash costs significant amounts to handle.  Merchants must balance cash drawers at least once a day, counting and recounting the slips of paper. Someone at the merchant usually has to cross-check that count and fill out a bank deposit slip.  Someone delivers that cash to a bank, who counts it again. Banks have security since theft is a problem. For a bank branch to send the cash to their main office requires armored cars.  Machines are needed just to sort and wash the cash.  Guards are used to put cash into ATM machines. Security systems surround the entire mechanism.
Bitcoin does not require all of the levels of handling necessary for cash.  Securing bitcoin, while somewhat complex, is not as onerous as cash.

The voting logic detects when a specific percentage of miners (and full nodes?) are running code that supports a change.  At specific block intervals, the logic tests to see if a tipping point is reached, this is publicized and the new rules will begin to take effect at a specific block in the future.
If there are not enough people running the new code, the old code will be used (and the new code will be improved or phased out).
That is my basic understanding of the process.
@_date: 2015-02-03 13:58:09
Cash is not necessarily cheaper for the merchant to handle.  Unlike electronic payments (currently credit/debit), it takes time to make change with cash, and ensure there are no forgeries, time for the cash drawer to be counted (and usually recounted). There is risk of theft (and violence).  Then deposit slips have to be written and someone needs to deliver the cash to a financial institution for recording, where it gets sorted and counted again.  Many banks charge the merchant for making deposits.  Banks have to secure the cash from theft and have to pay armed guards for transportation and to load that cash into ATMs.
Credit/debit payments require a 3-5% surcharge (the merchant cannot always predict the exact charge since they get charged for for rewards cards), risk of chargeback, and the merchant won't see their portion of the payment for a week.  It is generally faster for a merchant to accept credit/debit since change does not need to be made.  Balancing the drawer at the end of a shift is a bit less tedious.
Bitcoin payments don't have these downsides, and BitPay/Coinbase charge no fee or a flat fee that is predictable. Volatility is not an issue. Balancing the drawer at the end of a shift is much the same as credit cards.

@_date: 2015-02-09 19:38:22
Yes, they can.  Transactions are made up of inputs (the $20 bill in your pocket) and outputs (the $4.95 you want to pay Starbucks, and $15 in change back to you).  If the total input is more than the total output, that is the transaction fee ($0.05, in my example).
This is why transactions without fees take a long time to confirm, since miners often ignore them in favor of transactions with fees.

Correct!  You can also load the xpub from your live Mycelium wallet into Electrum so you can watch your smartphone balance from your desktop app.  Note that Mycelium supports BIP44 (subaccounts) and Electrum does not, but each subaccount has a unique xpub that can be loaded into Electrum.  Pretty cool.

I have heard that unconfirmed transactions will get dropped from the mempool after a few days.  Until that time, your wallet should not allow you to submit a new transaction that consumes the same inputs.
When the transaction gets dropped from the mempool, the wallet should no longer see the transaction waiting for confirmation and remove it from its memory as well. The coins are not lost.

0.0002 (0.2mBTC) will help to ensure your transaction gets included in the next block.  The normal fee is 0.0001 (0.1 mBTC) usually works for getting in the next block.  I often use 0.00001 (0.01mBTC) and my transactions usually confirm within 20 minutes.
If you are not in a hurry, use the lower fee (the difference is currently about $0.025 US to $0.0025 US), so you can save pennies.

A traditional database has an owner.  A blockchain is owned and maintained by many players.  Since no single party has full administrative access (and can remove/resequence) entries in a blockchain, it has an improved trust model over traditional databases.  The capability for everyone to validate the entries also improves trust.
Traditional databases are centralized, and by necessity, the central entity has administrative access.  
If Visa decides to stop accepting transactions for someone (Wikileaks comes to mind), it is a single choke point.  But what if Visa decides that they no longer want to approve purchases made by Chase customers?  They have that capability.
Using a blockchain across many institutions helps reduce the control points, so if Bank of America wants to block Chase transactions from hitting the shared blockchain, they can, but Chase will still be publishing them and most other banks will accept them and publish them to the blockchain they all share.
The immutable (unchangeable) nature of blockchains means that a bad player can't erase/alter records, since blocks are built on top of it and seal the history in place.  A traditional database requires a single command to remove a specific entry, no matter how long it has been in the database.
While a single institution might try to build blocks that place their transactions ahead of other institutions in a block, there is no guarantee that they will be successful.
Still, private blockchains run by members of an industry have the problem of competing hashing power, where big players may be confirming more blocks than smaller players.  This would give the big players more control over the sequencing/inclusion/exclusion of transactions in blocks they 'mine'. This needs to be held in check.  I do not expect them to play fairly, based on past experience.  They will take any advantage they can get.

I have had great success with a fee of 0.01 mBTC (1/4 of a penny).  It may take 20-60 minutes to confirm, but it always confirms.  The amount you are sending does not matter to the fee (could be $0.20 or $2,000,000.00)
Fees are generally based on the size of the transaction, which is determined by the number of inputs and the number of outputs.
Inputs can be compared to the bills in your wallet.  If you went to an ATM at pulled out $100, they probably gave you 5 $20 bills (5 outputs from the ATM that you have not yet spent).  
If you want to buy something for $65, you need to hand over 4 bills (4 of those unspent outputs of previous transactions).
The outputs would be the $65 to the payee and $15 change back to your wallet (two outputs).
Each input and output requires space in the transaction, and the transaction fee is supposed to be based on the overall size.
With all this, 0.01 mBTC seems to work for me.

BIP32 support (word seeds) and you can export/import xpub/xpriv keys as well.
You can have Multisignature wallets (2 of 2 and 2 of 3 are supported).  There is a plugin that will transmit transactions to the other parties for signing when needed.
Electrum lets you run in an online/offline mode so you can keep your private keys on an offline device (just move the transactions there via thumb drive for signing).

"Be your own bank" means that you assume the protection and management of your bitcoin.  Since bitcoin can be stored offline in cold wallets and in multisig wallets, bitcoin can be better secured.
Banks and centralized bitcoin exchanges have a big target on them since a hacker can focus on breaking their encryption/protection once and access funds belonging to many customers.
With everyone being their own bitcoin bank, hackers have to target individuals (rather than centralized institutions) with potentially smaller reward for their effort.  By using multisig, bad players not only have to crack one device, but several devices that are all related.  Which devices is not clear since the P2SH address does not reveal the public keys of the approved signers.  This spreads the risk rather than centralizes it.
tl;dr: A bad actor can hack one bank/exchange and get away with lots of funds.  The same bad actor can hack one individual person's wallet and get a few bitcoin, at best.  With multisig, they have to have two or more people's devices to get at a few bitcoin.

I trust Mycelium, but I do not trust that everything installed on my phone will never get hacked (especially since carriers install so much of their own stuff).
I trust Mycelium, but I don't trust that someone who knows I have bitcoin might try to rob me at gunpoint.
Electrum 2.0 (coming out this week) has multisig wallets (2of2 and 2of3) so even if my computer gets hacked, they also need to get into other offline devices.
Paper wallets with BIP38 passphrase encryption are a pretty good way to carry extra bitcoin with you for those spending 'emergencies'.  If my wallet gets lost/stolen, they still need the passphrase to take my bitcoin.
There are many alternatives for securing your bitcoin.  Don't keep them all in one wallet.

Even if there is no block reward, the miners would continue to receive the transaction fees.  
Full nodes (used to validate transactions and blocks) don't get any reward today, but there are still many people running them.  The incentive is simply to keep the blockchain working properly so our existing bitcoin holds value.

Whenever bitcoin leave your possession and control there is a potential for a tax event.  The IRS treats bitcoin as property and you need to declare capital gains or losses based on the value of the bitcoin when you bought them compared to the value of the bitcoin when you sold them.
If you bought 1 BTC at $600 and sold 0.250 BTC when the price was $200/BTC, the value of that 0.250BTC was $150 ($600 x .250) and the value at the time of sale was $50 ($200 x .250), so you would declare a capital loss of $100 ($150 - $50).  If you bought the bitcoin over a year ago this is a 'long term' capital loss (otherwise short term).
If the bitcoin were earned through mining, this should be declared as income.
You do not report your purchases of bitcoin to the IRS, just the events when you sell or give it to someone.  The form 8959 (I think) asks for the type of transaction ('bitcoin') the value of the bitcoin when they were sold ($50 in this case), the value when they were purchased ($150) and the date of the purchase and the sale.  The blockchain holds the log of all transactions, so that should help.
I am not a tax accountant.

Remember Yahoo Music? They were precisely the "phone home" model, but eventually Yahoo got tired of running servers to support it.  The result was that people couldn't play their music anymore.  Certainly Yahoo stepped up eventually and issued refunds (taking any income they received from their investment).
Using the blockchain for DRM allows several things: 1) Resiliency - while DDOS may block the Xbox network or Sony's network, preventing people from using their consoles, the blockchain is distributed and is incredibly more difficult to disrupt.  2) Proof of ownership - The blockchain is, afterall, a ledger of ownership, 3) Transfer of ownership - Once a user makes it to level 99 of the game and is finished, they can resell the game and transfer the ownership to someone else who can now enjoy it.   This can be done without requiring Xbox or Sony to give permission or even getting involved in the transaction.  4) Transportability - these benefits can happen anywhere there is an internet connection.
Certainly there will probably be those that try to remove the constraints, but much of piracy is to work around unreasonable non-technical constraints (price, portability).
Transfer of ownership can work on the blockchain, certainly for electronic medium, but can work with physical objects. When I bought a house I had to pay for a title search to make sure the previous owner really possessed the title for the house.  An that owner had to pay for a title search when they bought it before me. A blockchain can make that all go away since ownership is tracked on an open and public ledger.

I recently tried several wallets and decided on MultiBit.  While Electrum and Armory are 'deterministic' wallets (the addresses can be regenerated from the initial seed value, so you don't have to do repeated backups when new addresses are added), I also felt that this feature was a security gap, since one key unlocked everything.
I also like that MultiBit lets me transact in BTC or USD (or many other currencies), unlike the others I tried that made me keep a calculator app on-hand.
MultiBit wallets can easily be encrypted (choose the File/Add_password menu option).
The other MultiBit feature was that I could have several wallets open at once.
Armory required bitcoind/bitcoin-qt and a full blockchain download (~20G) plus its own database of about the same size. I just don't see a need that overhead.  Bitcoind (and the user-interface) bitcoin-qt is the reference implementation, but only lets you have one wallet at a time (it must be in a certain directory with the blockchain and be named 'wallet.dat'), so it makes separating your funds a significant pain. Armory allows multiple wallets, but I just did not like the significant storage requirements and startup time to download the initial blockchain and generate its internal database.
When you start any of these wallet programs, it will try to sync up to the blockchain. MultiBit and Electrum use the short version, which speeds things up, but Electrum disconnects from the P2P network when it is done. So, when I would send BTC, Electrum would have to wait to establish fresh connections before the transaction would be sent. In MultiBit, it is sent instantly.
That's my 0.02 BTC on the subject. YMMV.
Edit: Added comments on bitcoind/-qt

MultiBit.  While Electrum has the convenience of having deterministic keys (you backup the wallet's seed once and you don't have to do another backup), but this just worries me as it feels like putting all of the eggs in one basket.
While MultiBit wallets require a fresh backup when new addresses are generated, it is not hard to just generate 100 at a time, and do a backup, done.
I also like that MultiBit lets me enter transactions in $ or BTC, so I don't need to open a calculator to do the conversion or validate it.
MultiBit sent my transactions immediately, without delay. It seemed that Electrum had to establish fresh connections to the P2P network, which took a couple minutes.

Well, the way I understand how the mining rewards work, more than half of the bitcoins ever to be created already have been.  In another 3 years, 75%, four years later, 87.5%, ...the deflationary curve will be largely steady within a decade.
The mining rewards for first four years were 50 bitcoins every 10 minutes, then 25 for the next 4 years, 12.5, 6.25, and so on.  The huge deflationary curve was purposefully loded at the front of the process to urge mining and now we're reaching the adoption phase where people are able to buy things with their bitcoin.

Agreed. Having a ledger and associating the transaction with the customer is a good thing. In case of refund, you can return the appropriate number of bitcoin, rather than the USD value, which would be completely appropriate (no need for your business to act as an exchange).

As the 'sender', you will need to confirm the payment coming out of your wallet, and be online. Your wallet will send the transaction to the P2P network, where it can be confirmed (validate that the coins are yours and you have not spent them before).  But the coins are out of your wallet and very soon after it hits the P2P network, even before the first confirmation, Subway will see that you submitted the transaction and you will be on your way.
Since a Subway sandwich doesn't cost very much, they won't need to wait for any confirmations. If you are buying something of greater value (~$100USD) the receiver may want you to wait around the store for at least one confirmation, or as many as 6 for more pricey items.
As stated all over the place, having a small amount of coin in your smartphone is handy, but move most of your coins from an online (Coinbase, or others) wallet to a wallet you can control and secure.
Since wallets don't need to be online to receive money, only the buyer needs to unlock their wallet to confirm. This makes it very secure for Subway, as only the manager would have much need to unlock their wallet (much like a manager often has to unlock a cash register to give a refund). Even so, they can use a 'slush fund' wallet with a few coins in it just for such circumstances.

I have not heard about Sberbank's offering but have taken a cursory look at JP Morgan's.  The problem with the solution is the same as the current fiat system: it is centralized and controlled and can be manipulated by a few greedy people.
Bitcoin (and many of the other altcoins) are decentralized and not controlled by these corporations.  Certainly that is why they don't like it, but, like BitTorrent, it is not going to be very easy for them to stop the Bitcoin protocol.
Certainly this will impact bitcoin price and adoption, but it will probably be a short while before they start charging more fees to transact in their own type of coin.  Adoption would have to match, and right now they are starting from scratch.

BitPay charges a flat rate $30/month for any number of transactions up to $30k in sales.

Generally the export of the private keys with a password is sufficient. Store that file using the 3-2-1 backup approach: 3 copies on a least 2 different storage formats (disk/sd/dvd/print...) and at least one of them outside your house (in case of theft/fire).
If you add receiving addresses to the wallet, you will need to do a fresh backup (as each address has its own private key). I usually add 100 addresses to the wallet when I create it, then a backup.

The beauty of QR codes and always-on smartphones means that the sender or receiver can enter the price in their fiat currency and the app will do the currency conversion to the proper BTC, all the way down to 8 decimal places. The other party just has to scan the code and verify the amount is correct.
Some services (BitPay and Coinbase for sure) let the recipient indicate if they want to sell the coins and deposit the fiat into the bank account, or simply keep the bitcoin in the merchant's wallet.  I believe BitPay will guarantee the exchange rate used for the sale to your customer will match what they sell the BTC for and deposit to your account (less applicable fees, of course).
