Maybe today but no one knows what the conditions will be tomorrow.   You may think you know, but you do not.

Yeah no kidding.  It would be the worst thing for Bitcoin and gov'ts will use their hashpower to destroy it.

Too many big words in there for those who think "daytrading is gambling".   They aren't going to get it, because they aren't capable, and also because they don't want to believe that anyone is smarter than they are.

I got banned from from one of my other IDs, but that was for laying into someone pretty good and I get it.

Yes I am maybe slightly above average intelligence with a lot of bad trading habits and I have to struggle to do well with it.  I mostly self-sabotage and fall into the same traps often, but I'm way up this year and over the past few years.
It isn't rocket science, but does take a certainly level of smarts and a lot of self-discipline.  Most people could not learn to do it succesfully, which is why something like 90% of daytraders fail.

Yes, often the best strategy in a market that only moves upwards.

It would make more sense to post this after the fork, with facts about how it went down, rather than your fantasies of how you are praying that events will transpire.
But I guess that's not how propaganda works.

Good question.  I feel like a total loser with trading much of the time, but my spreadsheet says different.  I occasionally trade smart and get some big scores and somehow they offset my big losses.
And this is over literally thousands of trades over 4+ years, so can't say it's luck, either good or bad.
Of course if I would have held the BTC, XMR, and ETH that I had at low prices, I would be a multi-millionaire, but always play defensive to protect my capital and has definitely limited my gains.
But I went from being broke to being far from broke, so that feels good.

I don't get that at all.  I honesty never even glance at mine and the only reason I care about downvotes at all is that if I get too many, I can't post as often and have to start a new acct.

I probably would have been more into it when I was younger, but now it clearly seems fairly worthless.

If you potentially do something with that information, then you aren't a junky.

It's easy to make a stupid post and get buried in upvotes.   It is not challenging and I would rather keep it real.
But maybe you are saying that it's good to do that so your account doesn't get restricted.  That's not a bad idea maybe.
