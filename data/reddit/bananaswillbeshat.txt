[Mega]( is a great place to do so. Encrypted uploads, and servers based in the country of Germany, known for their strict privacy laws. Not to mention the company's slogan is "The Privacy Company".

Why is that?

Unlike Google, Mega actually live up to their slogan.

BitTorrent Sync is great and all, but it's not a storage/backup solution.

Yes. The government can now jerk of to those nude pics aswell.

Not to be a jackass or anything, but I'm pretty sure it's *schön* and not schoen.
I could be wrong though!

Yes. All the Mega servers are placed in Germany. A country that is known for insanely strict privacy laws, there are many articles to support this. I believe reading that there isn't a very good relationship between Google and Germany, simply due to Google's way of handling users privacy.

It is possible if the files are shared publicly. When you share a file publicly, the encryption key is being shared aswell, thus making it possible to know what the content of the file is. If you do not share your files, they will remain totaly encrypted. 
But please, I'd like to see a source on the banning accounts based on filenames thing.

Yeah.. I've mixed up *schon* and *schön* quite a lot in the first years of learning German. Who'd knew there could be such a big diffrence between those words!?

I don't think there's anything wrong in doing what he did. That's the way this world works.. It's quite clever actually. If it would have been illegal, it would have been a whole other case, but it's not.

BitTorrent Sync is alright, though it doesn't offer a cloud storage/backup feature like Dropbox, which might be useful in some cases and what not, like quickly accesing a specific file from a computer/device that you don't have it installed on. 
Though, I'd suggest [Mega]( for that, a New Zealand based company calling themselves "The privacy company", and will have sync clients ready pretty soon they say, to replace Dropbox.

They've said their sync clients are almost ready to be released.
