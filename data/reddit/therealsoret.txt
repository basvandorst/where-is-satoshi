And you are stupid to think theoretically about potential attacks on BTC's ecosystem. The fact that you are ignorant about potentiality of this scale of an attack, it baffles me. You could be Satoshi also trying to protect your "super attack weapon" against the world's financial system, BTC what we will use in the future as our money..
@_date: 2018-09-16 14:29:33
You seem just as dumb to not be able to theorize about important topics.
@_date: 2018-09-16 19:35:13
I mean here we just have to protect our heritage, Bitcoin. It's nothing dangerous, just gotta make sure not even Satoshi does something evil if he still owns the Bitcoins. Finally some sensible reply, all the others are retards.

Well, have fun letting your Grand Grand Grand Grand Grand Grand children get killed in the Satoshi wars fueled by the Genesis Block funds.
@_date: 2018-09-16 10:18:30
Fuck it, seems I must let my grand grand grand grand grand grand grand relatives know about the dangers and what alternatives to buy to fight the satoshi menace in the future when he unleashes his 400k bitcoins.

We can mandate by community consensus to only block these funds from being processed. No other funds ever have to be blocked this way on the blockchain. And if we really can't then god save us all if my theory ever in the future becomes reality because that will be the end of the world as we know it.

We must ask, does the dead have rights to his own funds? What if Hal Finney returns and fucks us all over?

It's ethically questionable. There is no known precedent that someone who permanently passed away should receive back his material goods after family inheritance have happened.
@_date: 2018-09-17 05:16:49
It's not censorship when you block the creator's funds to prevent a catastrophic event, this does not create precedent for further censorship of private funds of other individuals. What if an exchange loses a lot of money? This won't happen, those funds can be traced but publicly available funds that just stand by can cause problems if for example the owner is Hal Finney.

Hal Finney is doing this. In comparison, he's just on ice.

I just figured out your icon is your forehead.
@_date: 2018-11-30 15:21:51
I'm going to need a more objective approach for it. I do understand people are fed up, but I need to know the reasons. I think it doesn't do enough justice for anyone that nobody is considering and proving why these things are happening. We need to know more, not less.
@_date: 2018-11-30 11:33:11
I'm more focused on declining trusts role on crypto adoption. You have any suggestions? 
@_date: 2018-11-30 11:43:48
No, I mean as people lose trust in government and banks, how that accelerates this. It might not be so apparent for you where you live. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 17:28:17
I have no intention to pay it neither. xD Especially for this stupid government we have.

It must be fun that my totally offline ColdCard from CoinKite was able to restore my Ledger Nano S wallet with their super secret few megabyte server installed right onto my ColdCard, they must have millions of private seeds also on their servers!!!!!!111!

Get a lawyer, lawyer will fly over to their HQ with you, the problem gets sorted if you aren't a phony little scammer and then you pay the premium for your lawyer and everyone is happy!

I really hope.

If you buy 1 bitcoin and remove that bitcoin from an exchange, then you decrease the liquidity. This is a good thing. Those who do this, essentially help bitcoin and give an underlying support to its cause with that creating an intrinsic value. Remember, it might be 3k now but for someone else priceless. You should instead ask the question, how long can you keep doing this cat and mouse game before most of the big bags redistribute their bitcoins over the market to hodlers?
@_date: 2018-12-08 13:13:33
Well, I'm not blaming you bra, you did a service to our country by letting others obtain BTC too.
@_date: 2018-12-05 10:20:39
Imagine this in the millions of % because of one way inflation. Fiat becomes useless for us.
