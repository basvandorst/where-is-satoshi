They were great up till now..I understand shit happens but why is there no phone number etc.. No management or higher ups to rectify a problem.. How can you feel secure without any human to contact l? Imagine it was $10,000 or something. I don't trust it. Luckily it was a small amount, but still substantial to me

I made a bitcoin purchase through my debit card. The money was taken from my bank account and shows on my statement as :
7/12/16.                                                              -$250
debit purchase on 07/05 @ 4:53 CBPURCHASE
CBPURCHASE SAN FRANCISCO OR CARD OR CARD NBR -5467
And another one for $150.00...however it does not even appear as a transaction on coinbase at all. It's like it never happened at all.

So i bought $400 but never got my coins,but was charged
@_date: 2016-07-23 19:09:52
I did but too late

Ok well I've bought plenty through coinbase. This time however, $400 was charged to my bank account and I never received bitcoin. Meaning $400 was taken by coinbase from my bank account and in return i got nothing.

I've been going bsck and forth 2 weeks.. Gettin pissed off now
@_date: 2016-07-24 12:18:01
3 wrongs!!! I like how you think there's only 3 possible scenarios that coinbase could possibly make a mistake though..
@_date: 2016-07-23 19:08:33
Yea then it declined so it didn't show in my coinbase wallet but did get taken from my bank account.
@_date: 2016-07-23 21:52:12
I tried to buy $400 it was declined. But it was still taken out of my bank account

Actually bitcoin_forever i am not a troll or stupid, and you actually sound robotic in your response. Coinbase was good up till now and I've never had a problem with them but i am having a problem now so i am now posting about it. Not even really sure what your response was, but yea be warned coinbase runs good until it doesn't and if you end up with a problem where they take money from you, good luck communicating with a human. And if you're patient enough to have your money tied up and only get 1 email response once a week from support.. Then god bless you.. You are a saint

Im not a troll. But i am hoping someone from coinbase will see my complaints and possibly reach out to help me get my money back because they'll respond once then ignore me for a week

It got declined so no coins in my wallet but the $400 definitely got taken from my bank account
