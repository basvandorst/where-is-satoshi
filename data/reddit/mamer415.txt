Overly involved parents much?

The libertarian crap is such a turn off. 
I don't listen to the majority of the BTC podcasts because they're just a bunch of anti-gubmint morons.

Pretty odd that not a single person on this (almost 121k reader) subreddit has gotten an invite yet...

It's 2014 and you're quoting Gox prices like it means something...

Given all the pizza options in San Francisco it's safe to conclude that you have terrible taste. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 05:30:56
Why did you use an unproven site like that?
@_date: 2014-04-26 07:53:40
The website specifically mentions selling access to metered parking spaces. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 06:08:17
Pretty sure it's illegal to sell public space...
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:27:57
Had the same thought. This show is fantastic!

Does installing 3rd party firmware (e.g. tomato, dd-wrt, etc.) prevent this?
@_date: 2014-02-06 08:06:47
Why not just release it as an .ipa file through their website?
@_date: 2014-04-01 07:52:08
Got one too.

I promise. Cold storage in a safety deposit box.

It didn't occur to you that there could be another location, huh?

Buy BTC, then hold until you need rubles then you cash out what you need. That'd protect you from crashing ruble prices.

Serious question. Did Warren Buffett have any comments about the internet in it's early stages?
@_date: 2014-04-26 06:14:59
All this money and publicity, promises of something "soon", and we still have no idea what they actually do. 
Can anyone tell me if that's an incorrect assessment if the situation? I'm utterly confused. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 17:27:04
If you're drooling over this, you have bad taste, and you should feel bad.

Nice selection of Dr Bronners soap in the background. Treat yourself to some of that!
@_date: 2013-11-12 09:14:14
Of what? Human interaction?
@_date: 2013-10-17 17:23:47
We're full. Please see another region. 
In reality there's way less BTC activity going on here than you'd imagine.

This. This a million times.
Between crap like this and the ineloquent hucksters who are the current faces of Bitcoin (Winklevii, Shrem, etc.) we've got a long road ahead of us.
@_date: 2013-04-16 06:52:34
Good luck to ya. I've been meaning to stop by for a while.

Tried to buy something at the North Beach location but it was a major hassle. I wish they would take training the employees in accepting BTC more seriously. That being said, it's a must visit if you're in town. 
@_date: 2013-08-07 15:19:03
Thank you for saying it. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 09:02:33
Did you just use a place that claimed this...
"I'd like to remind you that many of the stooges at Zero Hedge happen to be Jewish, which explains why they get so much media attention despite the fact that they have no track record, no credibility, and have been involved in securities fraud. "
...as a source? Christ almighty.
@_date: 2013-06-28 22:06:58
Why put restrictions on this at all. 
@_date: 2013-10-11 03:19:19
Not a chance

Not sure what exactly to say, but I would avoid any libertarian angles. He's an old school democrat and that will absolutely not appeal to him.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:12:25
Totally on the same page. This is awesome.

The only thing scary about that is your typeface choice.

Description of the guy? Sellers in the area would be interested to know. 
@_date: 2013-05-20 20:49:29
I just installed the new version over the old version using the install commands provided on the electrum website. Worked like a charm!

Anyone have an opinion on how it would impact Bitcoin if they do manage to upgrade the existing system?
@_date: 2013-09-10 06:53:20
You don't say?

@_date: 2013-05-30 11:37:45
Brilliant logic. If people don't want to be verified they MUST have something to hide.
Given Gox's backlog of verifications and how that affects how quickly you could use their service I think that alone is a big enough disincentive, regardless of the anonymity aspect.

Just wanted to add that I've paid with BTC at both Buyers Best Friend and Cups and Cakes in San Francisco. Both experiences were fraught with problems and awareness. Thankfully the staff was patient and helpful at both places. 
There apparently still isn't a killer payment method, unfortunately. Which is a shame because more and more vendors are using Square now and it's super slick. 
@_date: 2013-05-21 20:38:15
God, that sounds horrendous.
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:18:35
Are you buying?
@_date: 2013-05-20 21:40:04
Yep that's what I did. Obviously before you do anything make sure you have your seed written down in case you need to restore. I don't remember having to restore. It just used the existing wallet file. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:58:08
Stupidest shit ever. The billboard, not the placement. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 18:31:48
I guess anything is worth a shot, eh?
@_date: 2013-10-14 10:06:16
Engage troll mode.
There are a handful of places. Buyers Best Friend has done awesome products.
