Im waiting for bitcoins next run now. Dont think it will get anywhere close to litecoin % percentage wise though. Im pretty new here. Is litecoins rise an indication that bitcoin may rise or fall?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:15:34
Thanks dude. But i meant buying somthing online with a retailer who accepts bitcoin via bitpay.
So is the pitpay app for my phone safe?
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:39:31
I am going to hold until it hits 22k. Then sell and buy again hoping it dips to 20.5k.
Tell me mickjagger is this somthing an experienced day trader would do. Or would they sell now

Hey i dont know whats gonna happen no one does we can just speculate
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:38:02
Lol relax. Doesnt look like a crash to me. Looks like our corrections have started to last for smaller amounts of time. I expect to see the price stay between 14000 and 16000 today and maybe tomorrow. Then continue to rise again. 
Of corse i may be wrong amd this is the enevitable crash. Oooooo
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:09:07
Hey. Buy and hold seems to have worked out the best for investors in the past. People add to their profit by selling at the ATH amd then buying back when it dips. This is risky though as you could lose bitcoin. Even for experts
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:38:02
Sell half maybe. Definatly hodl some. You definatly picked a wrong time to sell.  Could double or could halve by jan
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:34:27
I accidently sold all my bitcoin 3 hours ago. I was checking what the market would pay me right now. Basicly were in the same predicament as you. 
I bought back in at a loss of btc. I think its going on its next bull run soon. 
 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:23:51
Lol 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:29:38
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:49:45
Good point never thought of it that way. But if it never recovers and continues to plummet there will be no point
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:47:17
Dont sell. Wait for the alts to dip and then invest the other 20% of your assets in bitcoin and alts. 
(Probably be worth it though)

Ive been following this forum for a while. Bought in at 10k after reading about bitcoins recent gains, (a minisucle amount).
I never felt the need to sign up before. You guys basicly couched me through bitcoin without me even speaking to you guys directly.
I have an announcement to make guys. No one knows what the fuck is going to happen next guys. The amount of HoLders that have sold right now just shows. This is UNCHARTED WATERS my friends.
If your btc wallet is translating to life changing amounts right now i would seriously consider selling most of you btc. But hold some of it just in case. Or consider buying futures to hedge your btc.
People are having trouble selling at ATHs like today. Id consider buying bullion online from a trusted dealer. 
Nobody know whats going to happen. But buy and hoLd seems to be the best statergy.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:50:44
Coinbase. But that seems to be down..
Google bitcoin atm and get to one before the price recovers (if you are interested in buying low)
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:56:51
In a world where the investment vehicle has seen a 45% growth in the past week. Hey its your money. Im just saying that i recovered my 10% in a day. And i bought at an all time high. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:52:33
You should buy a bitcoin if you can afford to lose money. Because the theory is, we are at the beginning of some sort of financial revolution. Where alot more wealth is going to be pumped into bitcoin making your bitcoins price go up.
Another theory is that btc is a bubble and people will keep pumping it. It will crash eventually but o well.
Either way, id want to be in on the action. Youre likeley to see a 10x return on your money within a few months if the theorues are correct.
So the advantage of buying bitcoin is doubling your money right now.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:13:21
Take your money off the exchange. You might panic sell. Either sell now or hold 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:41:34
Buy gold
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:26:38
So what to do now. Just hold right until the next ATH
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:45:09
What country are you from. Im in the uk
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:35:33
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:30:39
Lol i have previously bought at ATHs too. Apparently not a bad decision 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:27:41
Not asking for financial advice. I just want to see if my judgement correlates with experienced traders

Wanted to know if it was normal.

Hey i dint know whats gonna happen no one does we can just speculate
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:17:29
I think your wrong about a correction. I think we saw it yesterday. 
I concur with the others. An ATM sounds like the best option for you. 10% fees but a this point who cares
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:14:53
If i were you id sell half or just over. This shits going to the moon my friend
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:36:26
Whays gonna happen.
Whens the real dip?
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:39:37
I will buy, do you take pre-orders. How many satoshis?
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:11:16
Same. But my gut tells me to hold. I might just sell to be free from this bitcoin, but i dont think that will solve it because i could lose money if the price goes up and i didnt hodl. Thats the thing with bitcoin you could lose money of your in or if your out. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:59:01
The same reason you see infomercials on drunk driving and stds.
Many think were still in a bull run and this is a correction. I believe the next few days will reveal the truth and i will make my decisions based on they play out
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:57:03
Hey man you're entitled to your opinion. I think you should have sold atleast 2 when it hit 10k
We are all participants in a ponzi scheme. These internet nerds managed to drive the price past 5k and have people believing in the dream of replacing fiat. They convinced people to buy at the begining of this year and suceeded. Those who bought are happy now and convincing other to buy. The price will rise again and the cycle continues. We are at the begining of going mainstream right now. If no freak accident happens or bad news ect. Were likeley to see 25k in a week or so. What happens next is anyones guess. 
Those are r/btc might flood the blockchain with transactions leaving us all fucked.
I think once it goes past 20k everyone should take out their initial investment and leave the profit in there. Then hodl till you can buy a car or house or start a bussiness os somthing. This shits gonna crash folks. Just dont be one of the losers.

@_date: 2017-12-12 14:15:13
Thats what i was thinking. I know when bitcoin goes on a run the alts dump. What usually happens when the alts go on a run though. What happens to btc. Note my goal.is to accumulate more btc not fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:03:50
25k by christmas??
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:55:16
Well it seems the rises have gotten quicker, so its only logical that the fall would follow suit.
But it could also go further. Who knows
