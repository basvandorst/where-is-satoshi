I actually did a YouTube review for them a few months ago when they came to Miami to personally deliver a rose gold Encrypto for a client. The one on the review is a stainless piece that they also brought along. Being a big fan of watches, I thought the models were pretty cool...unnecessary, but cool LOL. Here's the link to the review (with a little more substance than Blondie's ��): [

Nice man, you should definitely market these.

Ha, love it. May the Force of BTC be with you! ��

Yup, the two go hand in hand. It's so obvious ��

Congrats to the winner. Super cool mug by the way. Just went to your site and ordered it, along with your Big Bitcoin one, to use them on some of our Instagram pics. Do you have an Instagram page by any chance? We can tag you when we throw something up with the mugs.

Love it. There's nothing dirtier than money.

Well yeah, of course the QR code could just read kiss my ass and the WATCH would still be functional. The point is that QR provides access to a personal account, hence making the watch a functional deposit WALLET.  Is it overkill? Abso-freaking-lutely, but that's kind of the point ����‍♂️

It looks like a mailbox.
@_date: 2019-12-02 23:26:06
I think you might be letting your personal views of luxury taint your opinion. It's like if I say that only really successful people buy luxury watches, exotic cars, etc. That's not really my opinion by the way, but even if it was, it's not something I can justify...neither is the opposite.

Drawdowns are not relevant unless compared to returns. High drawdowns are not necessarily bad when accompanied with stronomical returns. It's all relative.

This is incorrect. "Fluctuates in value" is what all assets do. Saying that an asset is "volatile" or "more volatile" than another asset is incorrect unless you take into consideration risk-adjusted returns. You're looking at volatility in a vacuum and that is incorrect. There's no magic volatility number that makes buying one asset investing and another gambling. You need to take into consideration risk relative to return for it to make sense.
And regarding your comment that some assets require more monitoring than others, that is also incorrect. ALL assets require monitoring, stocks, bonds, commodities, Forex, crypto, etc. Now, if someone risks more than is prudent in an asset class in an "Lambo to the Moon" attempt, then that is pretty much gambling. But note that it's not the asset class that makes it gambling. It's the over-leveraging that equates it to blind speculation.
