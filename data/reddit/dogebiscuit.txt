I hedl onto my coin tight when I got it in 2013. I wanted to frame it, but then someone would steal its numbers. Then the price increased, and I hedl it with love, then the price dropped, and I hedl it with sympathy. I kept hodling it, my shiny digital coin, and it won't be sodl for a very, very, very, very long time. 
Fun fact: Todays that "once every quarter" I check the market, and just happen to log in right as it's breaching its previous high. Good timing! :-)
As much love I have for my shiny Coin of Bits, it shall never exceed the love I have for my shinier dogecoin army! But it's because of good ol' Bittie that I even learned of dogecoin, so there's that!

If a hard fork occurred, what would happen to BTC I purchased in 2013?

I was browsing this nerdy forum many years ago where these guys were talking about how their coins were now worth a few pennies. They were all so excited, eagerly giving 100's of these things to each other without reservation. "I just mined these 250 this morning, here have half!" 
I remember thinking, "This is silly. What an interesting way to waste time, mining invisible coins."
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:23:45
I picked you to ask this question to. What is the "fork threat" that people are talking about? Does it mean my investment back in 2013 might be at risk? Is there an ELI5 for what's going on and why it might be a threat? I only know the basics of what a fork is... two conflicting transfer authentications? Or something like that?
@_date: 2019-03-04 17:09:32
Well they tried.
They entered "typ" and then Google Auto-Filled their search with previous history:










And they got distracted and submitted their crappy assignments last minute.

Another newbie here. I thought the point of BCash was to allow for larger block sizes for BTC (which necessitated a hard fork) Assuming by blocksize you mean how many transactions are processed with each block, right?
My whole TLDR understanding of the fork was, "In order to increase BTC block size, we gotta push changes to the core, but there might be a fork and a new coin created in the process."
Again, my understanding may be way wrong here :) Thanks for reading.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:37:26
Just got here, after realizing it's Aug 1 and rushing to tune in,
So you're saying there are 2 coins now? Hypothetically, if someone hedl 1 coin before, now they have 1 BTC and 1 BCC?
Or have I got this all wrong. Trying to research what's happening but there's a lot of jargon :)
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:26:35
The hard fork exponentiated Coinbase's segwit infrastructure by cross-pollenating altcoins with moon-chasing early adaptors during the ICO of shareholders when market capitalization reached indecision during the 51% attack that happened when bear investors were manipulating the market with hashrate schemes, perpetuating the rollercoaster meme as people were quick to pull out and hodl onto FUD.
... and as a tech newbie, that's what this subreddit sounds like at times!
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:04:02
Paper wallet. Sounds great. Still, no idea how the friend I'm asking for is going to redeem the paper wallet onto an exchange in 5+ years after hodling though. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:24:13


Not OP, but thank you for clearing this up because I was wondering. I thought all of that stuff that happened August 1 was already activated. 


So BitCash is a bad guy, BTC's evil brother, who wants to take over? My oh my, this stuff gets confusing. But it's awesome to observe!
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:28:03
I'm glad I was so freaking confused and didn't even know how to access the bcash LOL. Then the price "crash" to sub $300...
"Nothing gained, nothing lost." 
Interesting series of events. I think the only thing I'm missing now is popcorn and hodl.

Hello there! Is this graph just a fun "what if"? Even if these were only 50% true... that is tremendous. Is this based on its performance-over-time? I'm trying to convince my wife to get into this Bitcoin thing with me, but she just keeps saying "it's too high" *le sigh* Our savings will forever remain dust in a freaking bank URGH. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:04:37
My thought exactly. They either realized they just became filthy rich and wanted to play it safe... or they realize the joke went too far. Gyah, and now we may never know! Just keep an eye out for 950btc transaction ;-)
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:05:21
OR they deleted the account because they realize they just became super rich and did not want to let that information get out there!

I had a friend who was a 280+pound (not exactly sure his weight– he was burly and rotund!) who squeezed into my passenger seat ... and it worked! He was cramped like crazy. We were both laughing as the car struggled to get rolling. It must have been a scene. He documented his success of weight loss according to how long it took him to get into my car.

It's like someone had to make a decision. "Hmmm... do I want .info? Nooooo, too affiliated with spammy websites. Ah, infos.st! Yes, more than one infos is more trustworthy! And it sends the message that they're walking down a street of infos!"

Perfect adaptation of that dialogue. There need be more GoT-Bitcoin crossover references :)

Mazda MX5 – but only an early enough year where they still had the [pop-up headlights]( The DogeCoin of cars. Not taken seriously, but tremendously lightweight, showing its power on winding, hilly roads! 
EDIT: If you've never driven one before, it's like returning to that feeling as a kid driving a go-kart. I've had mine for 10 years and I still smile every time I drive it. Also, the Miata permanently makes this face when you have the lights up:

This image is tripping me up. The fake camera blur makes me think this was taken with very low aperture, notable with close-up macro photography. It gives the impression that this setting is very small. As if someone 1000 miles tall took the photo by leaning down toward earth. It's very easy to pretend this is the case based on the way it is. Funny how a well-positioned blur can achieve mind-boggling effects.
Also, for some reason, it reminds me of the opening sequence for Game of Thrones. (Now the theme song is stuck in my head.)

Here's the story!
Many years ago, my wife and I moved $1500 into our spending checking account in order to withdraw and purchase.
This was around $3. But Local Bitcoin wasn't known then. And I was **ultra paranoid** that my coins would get stolen. And I wasn't sure how to purchase from a trusted seller at the time. (Paranoia was huge when it came to a whole $1500!) 
So I put the money back into savings and waited to do more research. And then hesitation crept in. 
But I don't beat myself up over it. It is a bit salty to think about, yes, but I don't blame myself. I just think of all of the people who have it much, much worse off, and I am grateful I did not suffer as much as them. 
(Sometimes I do calculations to see what my hypothetical purchase would be now. For fun. To soothe myself, I just pretend I would have sold at a false-high anyway, thus making it all for naught.)

You want to pay off your house but you're holding? While it wouldn't be a bad idea to pay off your house, you also don't want to sell at the wrong time. Unless you absolutely have no other option. It's nice to have it as a fallback option though!
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:16:11
I resisted buying at $0.30 because it was a silly nerd coin. I resisted buying when it rose to $3.00 because it wouldn't last. I resisted buying at $30.00 because I was too late. I resisted buying at $300.00 because I should have invested sooner. I resisted buying $3000.00 because I don't want a fraction of a coin. 
I'll probably resist at $30,000.00 as well :(
I'm probably the most knowledgable non Bitcoin owner because I first heard about and researched it when it was worth pennies ... time passes very fast!
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:59:47
I have made my very first super-small purchase shortly after I posted that :-)

If you want to expect the Y-axis to be true, then wouldn't it be reasonable to expect the X-axis to be true as well? From '14 to '17. Three years. Now magnify that time on an exponential scale, you might expect 30 years if this fractal will continue. But yes, at that point, $50-75K coins. However, I would hope they'd be worth significantly more after 30 years!

Don't worry about it. These things aren't new nor are they alarming. Hodl.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:53:30
That's my take on it exactly! Literally price drops like this shed fat (day traders/weak hodlings) and keep only the muscle (long term hodlers). It's very healthy for the economy because price drops encourage even more strong hodlers to get in and support the foundation. Of course these are all on-paper/in-vitro speculations. The rollercoaster goes where it pleases!
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:49:00
CONTEXT: Multiple massive buy/sells wiped out the walls on both ends, causing the price to spike and drop repeatedly and violently. This gif played when it went from 2500 to 2400 in a matter of seconds.
Gotta love the rollercoaster that is magical internet moneys!
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:58:21
A 10-20% drop back in the day would have created more panic than it does now. I speculize that it'll take a much more massive drop for it to become a downward spiral. Like someone wisely said in another thread, "These price drops are shedding off the weak hodlers." Very apt description. A 10% drop would cause someone with weak faith in bitcoin to sell in a heartbeat. People who've been hodling for awhile may simply smile and see it an opportunity to invest in a dip. The rollercoaster goes where it pleases. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:40:28
I would like to help. Where would I start? 
I could possibly do some light programming to automate some research.
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:09:21
In my opinion, there's way too much forward momentum for it to go less than 1000. People will see Bitcoin's previous drops and previous ATH's and see 1000 as a perfect time to invest. There's like a gravity that attracts Bitcoin to a certain value. 
Sure if it dropped to 500 again, yea there'd be a brief moment of panic right before thousands of investors think at the same time, "Now's my chance to get in!" thus driving the price up again. 
Obligatory Edit: I Might Be Wrong.
