If there's one thing I've learned about crypto price predictions, it's that nobody knows shit.

$18,000 - $20,000 = more nervous
$9,000 - $11,000 = not so nervous
This is honestly the full extent of what I was saying... no more, no less.  Good luck to you as well.  Cheers.

FYI... "You're newcomer that's not worried because you're newcomer" can take on a few connotations.  A. You're new and oblivious.  Or mine, B.  You didn't buy in at $20,000 but instead bought in much cheaper with odds of profiting likely to be in your favor.  "Assumptions", my friend.  You have a good weekend as well.

And people will be quick to call you retarded because you bought at an all-time high... like they were fucking fortune-tellers.

Bitcoin acceptance in Asia has grown substantially.  When you get there you will be  very impressed as to how much the landscape has actually changed in regards to crypto. 
Here is my best advice for you, however:  After having received your flight tickets, tear them up.  Don't go to Asia.  Come to NW Ohio and marry me.  I only have 1 in 10,000 chance of making a child so we had better start trying asap... 5 attempts per day will take 2,000 days.  Wait, did I get off track?

Because they don't want to see anyone make out on something they aren't involved with.  And if they aren't involved with it they either A. Don't understand it, or  B. Don't trust it.  If it's A. they won't admit it and claim B.  Either way they will want to be right... and they will want it to fail.

 You have to have $20,000 min in an exchange to day trade stocks.  I deposited much less than that when I first entered the cryptomarket and I was off to the races... although I wish I hadn't.  Don't day trade crypto.  You'll end up swearing like a crazy person.

Maybe not but Buffet made his fortune investing in things he knows... and tech hasn't exactly accounted for the majority of his vast knowledge, let alone crypto.  He doesn't invest in things he doesn't understand.  He just recently bought in to Apple... a very rare buy for him.

 What a lot of people don't realize is that most of the business that "accept" crypto actually use a go-between service that exchanges it to fiat.  They don't accept the actual crypto itself.
