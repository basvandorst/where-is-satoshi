“Never be as good as dash as a payments system” U wot m8? L I G H T N I N G  N E T W O R K! You act like it’s not every other post on r/bitcoin. Bitcoin is the once and forever king of payments.

Cool I’ve just been sleeping on Dash. I saw they were using it in that TenX video. More importantly, ROBIN HOOD DETHRONING CONBASE!!!

Remember the best technology doesn’t always win. I only say this because you think Dash is the better technology although I disagree. 
Bitcoin is the first mover and the most robust network. This makes it the most secure. Not to mention LN uses Tor routing for even more encryption and even confidential transactions. It has name recognition. Lightning network will enable more than just fast payments. If you need faster, cheaper transactions than LN I wonder just what kind of operation you’re running! Honestly I just think Dash has a stupid name. I don’t even hold any BTC. I’m all in GNT and Streamr. With some BAT and LTC. The good thing is, in crypto everyone can win as long as we HODL.

Ew gross I didn’t think anybody actually used FB anymore. I seriously thought it was mostly bots and teenagers. It’s crazy y’all are giving your data away for free when you already pay a phone bill where you can send encrypted imessages. Like wtf

Bcashers brigading the fuck outta the Medium article...scammers have a lot of time. Real ppl just go about their day. Bitcoin cash is of course obviously a scam. Anyone who believes other wise is simply wrong and stupid.

But capitalism is a failed system. The worker class should cooperatively own the means of production, it is the only way a “livable wage” is permitted in a system of production and consumption. Otherwise the owners of production will only pay just enough to keep the cog spinning in the machine, by design. 
It’s almost over though.
