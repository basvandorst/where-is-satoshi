Looking at all the charts, except for the one that matters most (Monthly)... it's February 1st tomorrow guys

You're gonna be disappointed when the leaders of Islamic finance (Malaysia not Egypt) adopt bitcoin

not sure tbh, largest candlestick is significant nonetheless, that's the main focus of my perspective, the largest bullish candlestick on Daily timeframe was painted yday,
BTFD at $13,600, $15,111 !!

I watch the market very closely... that's not the point, people are saying its discount like its guaranteed to go back up...
It has the potential to mislead newcomers and is possibly a part of signal/communication used for collusion in trading the markets (i.e., quick buy our sells or we're going short now/soon)... surely people here understand that yet its upvoted to top of r/bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:20:43
its not an offer... the price is the price, its not like you're gonna buy it 25% off and its suddenly worth extra... its still worth the same when you bought it... I get paid in btc, wonder how long my $470 will take to turn back into $570.. plus you're making the assumption it will go back up... a bit misleading to newcomers to say this shit
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:39:39
There is now a better offer, better than xmas special $12,500
@_date: 2018-05-10 11:27:52
"back to the Dark Ages..." no, a move away from fractional reserve banking is anything but a move back to the Dark Ages... maybe bitcoin have forced their hand a bit here?
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:33:09
bullshit, the availability of communication channels and some trigger words like BTFD, Discount, blah blah blah make collusion more effective/probable... You telling me there's no chance there's a group of traders pushing the market???... please...
$BTC still at a 'discount' i see, and the 'discount' will get bigger, so OP doesn't get how markets work...
@_date: 2018-06-22 02:00:08
It will crash even harder than now, because everyone expects it to go up
@_date: 2019-06-04 20:18:11
It's probably because the currency traders already have most of the market for crypto in Iran (speculation, I'm not Iranian or never been to Iran).. if they want to get btc or sell btc, why would they visit a foreign website when their trusted dealer is only down the street.
@_date: 2019-06-04 20:21:28
Neat. Technically, this is all a merchant needs to accept btc.
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:11:35
Recently visited my grandad's sister and was surprised to hear she heard and knew about bitcoin... I think this survey had a suboptimal sample, many people I meet/family are interested... regardless of age.
@_date: 2019-06-04 20:15:59
Revolut royally sucks, they completely stopped transfers from Kraken and Bitstamp ages ago. Don't let you send your bitcoin out their wallet either.
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:47:29
$25 dollars a night, what a deal
@_date: 2018-03-28 13:09:44
wasn't that a bittrex address?
@_date: 2018-03-13 18:51:26
until it's in the dictionary, we can argue all day over what is mooning or what is not, but I thought most would get the point that the author did exaggerate with the title. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:18:15
Really hope he manages to convince these central banks to begin studying and considering bitcoin, the developing nations leapfrogged with mobiles, we should see the same with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-13 18:08:36
not everything is supposed to be taken literally
nevertheless, Square's stock is doing better than bitcoin so far in 2018
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:35:55
you speak a lot of truth bitcoin-yoda
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:09:57
"so now you don’t have to buy a whole apartment." yeh, because home ownership is very undesirable and totally not something people strive for
@_date: 2018-03-13 18:55:09
cleansing the market already happened after December, when the big whales cashed out, r/bitcoin was telling us to buy the dip at Xmas ($14k LOL) and dumped on us all... we're at a stage now where the aftereffects are starting to be felt and people get depressed. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:24:00
nope, just highlighting how people just scream buy the dip and HODL here when they are probably filling these newcomer's buy orders
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:02:32
mooning more than bitcoin, it's in + for 2018 ;)
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:13:20
early adopters sold big amounts in mid-December, possibly colluded with each other and agreed to sell... then newbs followed and the bitcoin losses trickled down to everyone.
This sub was telling everyone to buy the dip at $14,000 or so, and I told them there will be a better discount, remember the discount posts in late December lol priceless
if anyone new bought because of that thread, lol, well they're kinda fucked now that the people who believe in bitcoin are already off the table, and waiting to buy back in
lesson is... don't let anyone fool you into their HODL mentality, its as bad as the brainwashing of Craig Wright... let you hold while they trade the markets and counting on their followers to remain on the sidelines
glad i saw through that shit before we entered 2018...
@_date: 2018-03-26 14:00:57
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:24:27
much scam, bitcoins taken by excessive tx fees before segwit much significant
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:20:38
yh that's true, but is this really a store of value when it gets inflated so much when it went above $11k, and now looks to crash slowly... with a few people on this sub calling for/upvoting posts people to buy in on the dip and HODL when it was $14k?....
we can reminisce all day
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:28:30
You can do that if you want... but I guess it just makes it easier since you buy stuff anyway and you kill two birds with one stone; 'I bought the item I wanted and invested the change into btc.'
@_date: 2018-03-13 18:52:59
maybe the reddit moderators saw the words "bitcoin" and "mooning" and didn't ban it or downvote, that sounds very likely
seriously there was a fake news story about S. Africa printing money at top of r/bitcoin the other day
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:12:17
$8k touched, let's look for a move above $10k for some happy bitcoiners
@_date: 2017-09-14 00:53:34
search the headline/hyperlink with google and then click on the search result, it's a trick that works around it
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:56:25
lol its been two months since we visited sub $9k
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:40:26
no doubt bitcoin helps, and has helped me to become more financially secure, but at the same time there is a bitcoin aristocracy and I think most people are burying their heads in the sand about this.
@_date: 2018-03-03 17:06:03
Segregate that witness
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:05:58
oh please.... left-wing, right-wing, chicken-wing, everyone is welcome to use bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:13:06
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:25:51
I think you are confusing verbs and nouns, let's not be so pedantic eh?
bitcoin has a value, that is a thing/noun
bitcoin's value, the verb, describes its price against fiat currencies
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:34:01
Russia is really getting into mining, along with Canada, hopefully other countries start to show a greater interest
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:14:08
Using Fibonacci charts (weekly) for the bull run to $19.6k, extension levels are at $29,982.89, $46,676.88, $63,370.87, and $73,687.75.... 
It's not impossible, but I think it is unlikely we will see $50,000 in 2018, my reasoning is that it will be a year further in the future where the $46,676.88 resistance is broken... If we get above ATH's in 2018, then we can talk about $30k not $50k...
@_date: 2017-10-04 09:32:00
we do not negotiate with financial terrorists, why is this even upvoted, this guy sucks
@_date: 2017-10-09 05:52:42
What do you mean it's a hoax? It looks like a legit paper to me
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:13:16
Similar in UK - about £500 which is about 8 percent I believe
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:23:59
so patronising have nothing useful to say?

Dude, where's my jet?

London BTM's are notoriously unreliable. Best bet would be old street.
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:25:30
Didn't your mother ever tell you if you have nothing good to say don't speak... Maybe you need to relearn some manners, I get this is on the internet, but in real life you would not say this to my face, or would you care to do so, I can arrange a meeting if you want
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:39:08
scam exchange, scammy coins always added, that should have been a warning for you
@_date: 2017-10-04 09:42:31
Ever look at a spread on a bitcoin ATM?
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:57:51
this guy gets it.

@_date: 2018-04-07 23:18:14
more of a hypnotist than a conman
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:34:39
yh I think so, the ATM is in the centre of it, at some place called Nin Com Soup
