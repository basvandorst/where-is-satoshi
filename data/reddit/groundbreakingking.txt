@_date: 2018-06-12 03:59:33

@_date: 2018-11-21 17:27:56
Nice flex. Why are you commenting then? One bad year and everyone starts saying I told you so... the electric car hybrid was invented until the 1980's but nobody gave much attention to it.. look at Tesla now? Everyone wants one. I'm sure there were people that said; "Electric car? ha, Gas is king! I'm not stupid enough to own an electric car that isn't backed by gas." 
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:40:19
Some big news today! Only a matter of time before I finally set foot on the moonss. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 07:09:35

@_date: 2018-11-28 06:59:47
"that's the fact, Jack" okay dad. Bitcoin went up today because of Nasdaq news. Amazon crashed before as well but I guess you haven't heard of that website yet. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 07:03:30

@_date: 2019-01-28 19:00:32
clearly he doesn't if he thinks crypto is just a payment option... and bitcoin is the best option. so . thank you, next. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 21:38:38

@_date: 2018-03-15 18:30:48
Just copy and paste.. no typing needed
@_date: 2019-01-13 05:24:18
bits. or bitcoin.. there is a big difference 
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:14:59
in the long run this really makes no difference. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 20:02:25
production costs? lmao. $30 for that is still a horrible deal.  
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:03:54
it's criminal that the banks put students in an endless debt cycle with one missed payment. yah... hike it up to 25% interest. That seems fair.... 
@_date: 2018-11-27 00:44:17
gud. your post was complete trash (much like this one) but just thought id remind you. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 22:22:10
it's march for fud sake. Bitcoin will rise. the charts actually don't look that bad, it needed to correct after that rise in December.  
@_date: 2019-01-18 13:56:35
it's "wen moon" 
@_date: 2019-01-28 14:22:01
You are clueless of how this all works. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 05:04:00

@_date: 2019-01-13 19:05:59

@_date: 2018-03-18 04:43:27
Nice Fud attempt loser. You clearly don't get what "decentralized" means.. gtfo. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:35:04
a whole 400?! high fukin roller here. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 08:31:46
Cool. Very nice
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:45:30
nasdaq doesn't agree. :) 
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:16:50
no, that's not what would happen at all. there will be regulations and thats fine, but when you come up with this crap of banks creating blockchains it really makes me wonder if you have any idea why bitcoin was created in the first place. I'm not saying you're going to be free of paying your property taxes or taxes on items at the grocery store. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:21:49
where did turdburger go? 
@_date: 2018-11-30 22:10:40

@_date: 2018-11-19 01:19:07
Tell me why having stock in Amazon or Apple is useful. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:52:56

@_date: 2018-02-11 22:47:23
a jizzbath sounds great! how is that bad?
@_date: 2019-01-28 18:46:29
oh really?! Weird. I didn't know the whole point of blockchain was just to be used a payment method. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:40:24
I know. Just to keep people safe I say 6k:)
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:21:30
what kind of job do you have? 
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:52:20
hide your kids hide your wife. bitcoin is going down to 5k and that's yo lyfe. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:40:58
you will find out why holders win. keep trading though. lol bots. brah. you only been in crypto for what? a week? you think those are whales with the bots? thats the exchange selling back your coins frm interest they gained frm you. I can promise you that if you hold a coin that has promise in the top 100 coins you will be richer in 6months then you would trying to trade. Sure you can win on trades but you will always short the next big leg up. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:35:05
drop to 6k please 
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:11:52
No spare fiat. get ready US bank. I'll send you some cash advance money soon. kappa.
