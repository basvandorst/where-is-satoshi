You have to send EUR - not USD. If you send USD then transferwise is looking for US bank account information.

The exchange rate for both exchanges is less than 1%.

It comes down to this; there are generally less sellers than buyers. It's easier to verify the sellers and have them establish a reputation than it is for all the buyers to establish a reputation.

I'm surprised this has taken so long.. this should have been done years ago. 
I am a little disappointed with the USB form factor though.. it means there's no way to use it with a secure pinpad which makes the whole proposition much less safe. 
Sure the keys can't be copied, but while the card is plugged in the malware on your pc can still sign transactions using the pin code it stole from your legitimate signing application.

I wonder if they'll do a Chinese article next.. How many Chinese people actually read chinadaily in English.

The best way is not too. 
Use bitstamp.net instead, you can transfer funds there using transferwise.com (local GBP bank transfer to transferwise and then they do the GBP -&gt; EUR currency conversion and send the funds to bitstamp by SEPA transfer. Although you are paying two fx fees (transferwise's GBP-EUR and bitstamp's EUR-USD) this remains a highly efficient way to obtain bitcoins as both transferwise and bitstamp give you fair fx rates.
You can actually use this same setup to deposit into mtgox's polish euro bank account too, but mtgox requires account verification (upload passport and utility bill scans) before you can do that and anyway bitstamp has currently lower prices than mtgox.
Another great option for the UK at the moment is  - buy person to person usually under &lt;10min using pingit or a UK bank transfer directly to the seller's account. The prices don't seem too bad at the moment either.. £9/BTC is only ~2% higher than current mtgoxGBP ask price.

My bank charges £10 for SEPA transfers but they also give a bad GBP -&gt; EUR exchange rate so the total cost is more.. possilby a 3% loss on fx and the £10 itself is a big percentage on smaller amounts. Transferwise charges £1 and has very reasonable fx fees.. the way it works is they give you an estimate when you place your order and then you send them the GBP they quoted.. but then they send you back some change depending on how good of a deal they were able to secure. So anyway yea.. with transferwise SEPA transfers cost £1 only + whatever the fx fee is.. you can probably use this setup with pretty much any exchange that maintains a euro bank account - although some of them may require you to be verified (such as mtgox) and may not be happy about the transfer not coming from your personal bank account.. it works with bitstamp.. if you want to try it elsewhere it might be best to contact their support first.

Well normally the smartcard requires a pin before it will sign a transaction so they would have to guess the pin. 
However, since there is no external pin terminal, you must be entering the pin on your computer.. which means it can be stolen by malware running on your computer.
Since the card is plugged into the same computer said malware can then just sign a transaction using the pin it stole; stealing all your money.
So basically you've taken a really great idea (secure smartcard hardware storage of keys) and made it not much better than just having them in an encrypted wallet stored on a usb key.

Well it's certainly possible for there to be bugs in the pinpad, however compared to a general purpose computer a pinpad is a very simple device and has a limited interface  back to the computer (where the malware presumably would try to attack it from).. and of course the whole point of a secure pinpad is that it should be designed with security in mind.. so yea maybe it might not be 100% secure but it should be more secure than entering a pin on a general purpose computer. 
Btw; I'm not suggesting that you should enter your pin on someone else's secure pinpad! who knows what they did to it and there might be cameras spying on you as you enter the pin ;)
