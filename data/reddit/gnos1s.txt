Exactly. I have found empirically that there's a probability of about 0.8 that a 3840 bit number generated in this fashion cannot be factorized by ECM up to 512 bits or GNFS up to 2048 bits, assuming you do some ECM work to eliminate numbers where too many bits of factors can be removed.

I concede your point that oil, silver, and gold prices are correlated; I looked into it a bit and there does seem to be evidence for that.
As for Bitcoin, how can you say that its price is tied to the prices of the above commodities? I've been watching the price for over a year, and it's obvious to me that the price is driven by psychological factors like exuberance, hoarding, and fear, as well as periodic influxes of newcomers.  There does not seem to be any connection to prices of oil or precious metals as far as I can tell.

According to [this table of the price of gold]( it was $594.90 in 1980 but then only $271.04 in 2001. Are you saying that the true value of gold was about the same in both years, but that the US dollar deflated by a factor of two?

I think the price of Bitcoin will always fluctuate wildly because of the hoarding problem you mention.  However, I think this is okay, because this does not affect its long-term function as a store of value.  Also, the fluctuations will be slower and have longer periods as more people use it.

Well, it depends on whether you have a long-term perspective or not, and how risk-averse you are.  Someone with few responsibilities and a secure, high-paying job can afford to take more risks.
I also feel like people who can't or won't learn cryptography and really deeply understand *why* Bitcoin will retain its value in the long-term should not be investing in it (except for playing around with small amounts).  I guess it's okay for these types of people to use it for rapid exchanges, and not as a store of value (e.g., for currency exchanges).

I don't think the lack of divisibility of normal currency is the reason for deflation's effects on the economy.  I think it's more of a collapsing of most/all economic bubbles that exist when the deflation starts. If they didn't exist in the first place, deflation wouldn't be so bad.

Why would they dump their BTC if they knew the price would come back up?
@_date: 2013-01-25 02:41:48
I think over the very long term, its value will keep increasing as long as:
* a better digital currency doesn't come along,
* the cryptography does not get broken, and
* civilization does not revert to some pre-Internet dark age.
I think all three of these are decent assumptions...

In addition to what others are suggesting here, look into [Shamir's secret-sharing scheme](  It allows you to, say, create 6 numbers and save them in diverse locations (on your computer, on paper in your wallet, in a safe-deposit box, with a friend, etc.), such that any 3 or more of these numbers will reconstitute a secret.
There is a program implementing this algorithm called [ssss](  The algorithm is not too hard to implement, so in theory, other programs could implement it.

That could reduce the cryptographic security of his holdings.
If he does not sign anything or send any money from his addresses, then the public keys are not known to the world -- only a pre-image attack against SHA-256 would enable stealing his money.

Just to expand on your post, one reason they are usually inversely correlated is because low risk and high return investments are in high demand, which drives up the initial cost and lowers the returns (measured as a percent of the initial cost).

Keep in mind, though, that technology is rapidly evolving, and Bitcoin has only existed for less than five years.  I think it's a safe bet that the average Joe will not ever be able to trust their life savings on a wallet on their PC, but with a custom piece of hardware, maybe they can.

No, the CA system *is* a joke.  And losing control of DNS records is *not* the only way to become vulnerable to MITM attacks.  If someone logs in with WiFi at a coffee shop, for instance, they can be easily MITM'd.  Another example is if they login with Tor.
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:39:15
Another way of saying this is that before you send money from a Bitcoin address, people would have to break both SHA256 and ECDSA, but after you send money, they only have to break ECDSA.  Even the latter is still intractable with current technology.

I realize it's too late to talk you out of this, but I think this is irresponsible, considering that you have a family who depends on you.  If you were young, able to work, and had no dependents, then I would say go all in.
If you *are* still going to be all in, then don't be scared by fluctuations. Watch out for these three things:
* attacks against the cryptography or fundamental algorithms of Bitcoin,
* a more useful digital currency, or
* a decline in the technology level of civilization.
Drops in value will always *eventually* rebound if they aren't due to any of these things.

Voluntary socialist here. The definition of socialism is "the workers control the means of production."
