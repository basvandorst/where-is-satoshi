So you get one to sign a fiduciary contract. If you have friends/family who are just SITTING on a million or more in cash, then you have an obligation to report them to your municipal mental health authority. They'll likely be taken away in a straight-jacket and never heard from again, but the problem will be solved from your end. I might be thinking about China, sometimes I get confused.

My main point of contention is not to do with education at all, rather with institutionalized altruism. When Governments claim to serve the greater good, when teachers and administrators rally for tax increases for "the children," they are ostensibly acting on altruistic motives. Nothing can be further from the truth. These institutions, in fact, all such institutions exist to serve themselves. The children, the greater good, etc... are just sideshows. Call me a cynic, but I've lived it, I've seen it.

But why would it be incumbent on society to bear the financial burden for this?
Shouldn't the parents be responsible for setting aside some of their income to provide for their child's education?

Why is society responsible for educating your kid? Serious question.

I make no such implication. If they could afford to marry and reproduce, then they need to cancel their cable, get rid of one of their cars, move into a smaller home, etc... It's called being a responsible adult.

Honorable men... can't differ?

Hey, me too! I accept your apology.

No one pays into SS, it's pay-as-you-go. This means that SS contributions are dispersed to current retirees. If there were an option to forgo SS contributions, or privatize it, even partially, I'd be all for that.

Who has $1MM liquid and can't afford to pay a financial planner?

I know that "honorable men can differ" was said in an episode of "The Simpsons" back when it was a good show. But that's not the genesis of the expression.
