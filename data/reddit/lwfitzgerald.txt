First off I'd recommend using [Tails]( here. I've put together a small guide for using it with a Trezor too, available [here](
Once a wallet is used outside of Tor you should treat it as de-anonymised as Electrum will request balances, linking the bitcoin addresses to your IP.
Tor + non-.onion Electrum server:
* Your IP is hidden - The Electrum server sees the IP of the Tor exit node
* If you use a non-SSL node, the Tor exit node can observe and manipulate data sent to and from the Electrum server
Tor + .onion server Electrum server:
* Your IP is hidden - The Electrum server only sees the IP of the Tor rendezvous node (see 
* Communication with the Electrum server is encrypted and cannot be observed or manipulated by others

There are non-SSL servers (see: 
Although the Tor project may monitor the exit nodes, there's nothing to prevent an operator changing their mind (particularly if there's a financial incentive). In the past people have been compromised by exit nodes man-in-the-middling traffic to Blockchain.info. Although the Electrum protocol does not expose your private key, if you were using Electrum to verify you had received a payment, you could be misled.
I guess what I'm saying is if you have the choice, why use a non-SSL/.onion server.
