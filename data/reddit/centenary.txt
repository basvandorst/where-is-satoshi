It would need to be long enough for the majority of unaffected people to forget about it.  I would say half a year at minimum.

Aw, I wish I had known this was happening.  Is there a schedule for when these are released?

I'm guessing you didn't pay attention to the annotations

If he wanted to get away with stealing 25,000 BTC, he would need to make sure that the pitchfork mob is as small as possible.  If he immediately shut down BitFloor, the pitchfork mob would include the people directly affected *and* tons of people who weren't directly affected.  By waiting a long time, he could thin out the pitchfork mob so that people who weren't directly affected wouldn't care enough to take action.


I'm not talking about the current situation.  I'm talking about the possibility that he stole 25,000 BTC and is now using this bank excuse as a way to avoid having to payback anything further.


Again, the bank excuse could be a way to avoid making further payouts.


Again, it would make the pitchfork mob considerably smaller and therefore less effective.


Which would be why he would need an excuse, like blaming his bank for preventing further operation and therefore further payouts.

I knew that you were joking, but it still came off poorly.  People only say "I won't dignify that with a response" if they think the question is stupid or insulting.

I don't know if this is actually a problem, it just struck me as an interesting problem that I haven't researched yet:
When someone holding Bitcoins dies and no one has access to their wallet, what happens?  Do the held Bitcoins effectively disappear from the market?  If so, would this cause Bitcoins to become more scarce with time?

I can think of more nefarious plans than that.  He could steal 25,000 BTC, then pay back only a small percentage of it to keep people from pitchforking him.  Then, as soon as a small percentage was paid back, close up shop and blame an external source as the reason for being unable to pay back more.
Sound familiar?  He's closed up shop and blamed his bank.  For all we know, it's a cover up for stealing 25,000 BTC.


If he really did steal 25,000 BTC, I don't see any reason why he would need people to continue using his business.  That number of BTC would make him a millionaire.

I knew exactly what you were saying from the start.  I like how you ignored my point that it is completely unrealistic.
Not even 5 hours would be enough time to sell 15K of Bitcoins while maintaining the same market value.  That would be an average of 3K per hour.  No Bitcoin exchange can sustain the same market value given 3K of sells per hour over 5 hours. The market value will inevitably drop, thereby invalidating your "75-100K" calculation.
If you want to maintain your fantasy of selling slowly enough to not cause the market value to drop, it would take on the order of weeks.
If said person believed that the government was going to block funds from being transferred out, it wouldn't make sense to wait weeks.  If you were faced with losing a small amount now versus losing everything, which would you choose?  You stated elsewhere that you value money, would you risk losing everything just so that you can earn an extra 5%?

Why did you ignore the key part of shallnotwastetime's comment?  What if the person simply needed fiat?
To sell a large number of Bitcoins quickly, you have to sell at below market value.  Otherwise, it would take a very long time to find enough buyers.  The same logic applies in any market.  Want to sell a house/car/anything very quickly?  Then you need to reduce the price to attract more buyers.
You're assuming malicious intent when the reason could be as simple as the person wanting to cash out quickly.
@_date: 2013-05-28 19:56:52


You don't seem to think that there are credible reasons for wanting to cash out quickly.  What if the person believed that the recent government escalation against Bitcoin sites spells bad news and wants to get fiat out before the government blocks all funds?  In that case, cashing out $1.9 million quickly now would be better than cashing out $0 later.


The only way to sell 15K within an hour is if your sell order is consistently at the top.  How do you guarantee that your sell order is consistently at the top?  You have to undercut everyone else.  In other words, sell at below market value.
If you don't guarantee that your sell order is at the top, then it would take an arbitrary amount of time to sell 15K of Bitcoins.  It would definitely take more than an hour, even on MtGox.  Especially considering that the trade volume on MtGox is usually less than 1K per hour.


Even if he had slowly sold the 15K over the course of an hour, inevitably he would have to start selling to existing buy orders.  That would consume buy orders, which would inevitably cause the market value to drop.  I'm certain that your 75-100K loss calculation doesn't take into consideration the inevitable drop in market value.  If you did take that into consideration, then show your math here.
