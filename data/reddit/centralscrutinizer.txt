Never going to happen. It’s being used now all over the world for payments. It’s only going to expand at this point.
@_date: 2019-07-11 12:41:54
Very true!

What do you mean you can not wait, there is no other possibility. You have to wait so therefore you can. ��
@_date: 2019-07-02 15:27:52
Lol I’m just busting your balls. Haha
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:58:21
Dollar cost average and all that jive is best.
@_date: 2019-07-11 09:33:12
People have been figuring a way into safes for years, this would be no different lol

Is this a particular app? I’m aware of DCA but just curious on that particular photo.
@_date: 2019-07-07 16:59:30
I Wouldn’t keep 5BTC on an exchange or even 1 BTC. Or even keep any amount on an exchange.
@_date: 2019-07-11 00:13:01
Put all you have into bitcoin and trade it constantly. Let me know how it works out.
@_date: 2019-08-15 09:08:42
How do people make day to day? Of course it’s a damn scam.
@_date: 2019-08-12 19:16:47
Ok and?
@_date: 2019-08-04 09:49:18
Cliff notes?
@_date: 2019-08-22 00:58:11
Investing is simple, don’t ever let someone invest for you with bitcoin. That’s just not smart at all
@_date: 2019-10-11 19:29:41
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:09:45
That’s good
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:04:16
Over the line!
@_date: 2019-08-02 16:38:27
I worry about me, not anyone else when it comes to investing.
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:20:26
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:39:15
I’m just messing with you man, ton of info out there though.
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:56:28
You invest only as much as you can actually afford. Which mean I wouldn’t be sinking all you have into it. That’s my take.
@_date: 2019-06-30 03:38:59
If ifs and buts were candy and nuts oh what Christmas it would be!
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:43:23
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:03:50
Seems fine for me
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:10:51
Um, can I get the English version please.
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:34:10
I live in Boston... so I may speak! Lol
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:06:48
No one said that ����
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:58:10
Yeah tough loss for a city that wins a championship every other season, I think Boston will be fine ha.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:43:46
Not really
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:40:44
1000 bucks a year considering what they say they you will be getting is not a big deal.
@_date: 2019-06-21 01:58:09
Up up and away
@_date: 2019-06-24 13:29:49
It never makes sense to listen to Linkin Park!! ��
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:24:47
No, that’s wrong
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:43:30
Damn right
@_date: 2019-06-30 19:50:58
Send it to your own wallet then send it from that wallet to Coinbase and you will be fine.
@_date: 2019-06-23 00:46:08

When you say , “us”, are you referring to the community here? If so, thanks, let me know when I should start packing.
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:29:06
Sounds like marriage

@_date: 2019-06-22 14:04:49
Chillllllll winnnnston, chill.  Depends on the wallet/exchange you are using.  Do you own any at all now? I’m assuming no.
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:43:19
It’s ok, we are here for you! Lol
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:41:22
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:45:53
I think a good way to judge it is not to stretch yourself thin at all with your everyday money needs. Put what you can in each month and after a while you won’t even realize it’s gone. Let it accumulate but don’t put in more than you can afford. Something is better than nothing.
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:20:16
I’ll give you 200 for it right now
@_date: 2019-09-01 22:52:06
None, bit or it’s shit
@_date: 2019-09-14 00:19:09
I have a bridge I have for sale, would you be interested in that?
@_date: 2019-09-03 08:57:52
I don’t know how anyone falls for these things.
