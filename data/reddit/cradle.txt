If you're going to correct do it right.
They said mammal when in the simulation, man when outside.

Which site?

Oh, and u get the best CPU *with* the GPU cluster, you can't rent the GPU cluster without that much CPU power; is that what you meant?

maybe they are?

You should look into the multiminer, automatic pool failover

You can calculate megahashes per second of nvidia Tesla GPUs in your head?

I'll buy them off you for MtGox USD?

Pricing is linear with instance hours, so yeah, could have saved money on the failed experiment by not using so many instances. 
I wanted to test pool mining on my own, and did, but wasn't able to make a local pool that was anywhere near as efficient as the big ones (deepbit.net). Having a server software which can handle 1.5 Gh/s is a lot different to just mining 200 Mh/s. I didn't write up my results of solo pooling, but I did mention it wasn't good. C'est la vie.

AFAIK there were no published statistics on the performance of the Tesla GPU's, later I found reports of them achieving ~50 Mh/s each. I achieved double that. There were also conflicting reports as to whether or not the "two" GPU's per Tesla "GPU" would result in 4 CUDA processing units; I found this not to be the case, at least, I couldn't access them separately. 
Regarding multiple instances

Try complaining to Gox (MagicalTux(?) as per other posts) regarding the ability to generate an API key without 2FA.
Request to know whether the transaction was done via the web or via an API call.
If it was via the web using 2FA, well, inside job or you did it (do you sleep walk?).
If it was via the API then complain to GOX that API keys should not be able to be generated without 2FA and demand your coin back.

It can be with English too, however 'you' is second person whereas 'that person' is third person gender neutral singular, a concept which English does not have a single word for afaik

haven't used it, but  exists
