This was the exact mentality of the personal computer ending up in homes. It'll never happen, it's too complicated. The barrier to entry is too damn high, etc. And it's true. Not a lot of people had IBM PCs in their homes because they cost as much as a decent used car and didn't have a high use case for the average user. Oh, but look at us now. If you're not connected, your an outsider nowadays. 
Someone probably already has the answer. There are too many geniuses out there, most of which we've never heard of. Someone's gonna come along and figure out the second half of the equation, making it user-friendly and when that happens, it's been won. Also, you gotta figure that soon kids are going to be born knowing about bitcoin from tot to teen and collectively they're the ones that aren't going to be sullied by our past mistakes. In the PC metaphor, those kids are going to be the ones to invent the internet. I remember setting up modem to modem games back in the DOS days and it got complicated quickly. And it was so slow, and so much work. And later in life, just by a few years, people were learning how to network game with ease by clicking a button. And today, console gaming is barely console gaming with the rise of the great and almighty network cloud. 
Will crypto replace cash? My opinion is probably. However, to say never would be scary. It would take government intervention, which probably would reduce confidence in cash, and bad stuff happens at that point.
