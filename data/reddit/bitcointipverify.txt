Thats good to know, once I have placed a reasonable amount into my bitcoin wallet is it wise to then download the wallet? does this remove it from the web so nobody else would be able to gain access?

I certainly hope not, I plan on buying bitcoins for the first time this coming weekend, its a long term investment however it would be nice for them to to crash too hard before bouncing back.

I have to be honest that thought did cross my mind, But saying that I have sent thousands in the past to japan when purchasing a car I had imported. I was a little more nervous with that transaction I can tell you!
Sometimes we just need a little faith that not everybody is out to screw us over, Dont get me wrong there are people out there like that and I feel sorry for them, mut that wont stop me having faith in humanity as a whole :)

I will accept bitcoin showers if they become available, Make it rain!

To be honest thats the only thing thats keeping me interested in buying in the new year, I can see real potential in it, I just need to get over this first.
I even said to them on the phone, whats stopping me creating an account, buying as much BTC as I can then claiming somebody had fraudulantly used my card? to which he didnt have an answer. 
The only reason I wouldnt is because I'm not a theif, but its too much of an easy option for those who want to.

I forgot to add, I spoke to a representative of paypal today and he informed me that I was mis-informed by the previous member of Paypal and I wasn’t covered. the only way I would receive the funds is if the buyer contacted them to inform them that they received the coins and were happy. This obviously will not happen as they only bought them in order to claim.
I was told if I had a problem to contact the police (I’m in the UK the first buyer is in Australia) Real practical solution.

Thats not a problem, Let apple and their iSheep stay away from open source.

Many thanks Natanael! I will download Electrum in prep for my first purchase, I think the $1 thats in my wallet at the moment thanks to should be safe for the moment lol

I sent a bank transfer through HSBC, the seller had a good reputation on the site and I received my bitcoins within 20 mins :)
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:46:13
to be fair I had approx 0.36***** Bitcoins, I wasnt aware I could sell that little on localbitcoins, and I dont have a coinbase account, I'm in the UK.
Edit* actually your probably right on the 'too lazy to look up how to cash out my investment in a better manner' I saw lots and lots selling on ebay and just assumed that if that was the case it was safe (hence why I said I knew it was my own fault)
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:02:52
I have purchased twice on localbitcoin without a hitch, I was a little wary at first with no comeback on bank transfers
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:02:30
What makes me greedy? I wanted to cash out in order to buy christmas gifts, and was planning on buying back in. This is only a secondary account of mine I created after looking into BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:23:36
Did them mention anything about rolling it out into other stores? I would love to be able to buy subway sandwiches with Bitcoin here in the UK!
@_date: 2013-11-21 10:56:15
Or you fill them in while pretending to do your real job ;)
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:51:42
Added to the list of things I need to research! :) Many thanks Natanael!
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:57:16
I'm not confused at all 10 posts/comments out of a total of 14 you have made on reddit are either you begging, asking or suggesting people send you money. and 2 of the 14 are you arguing with me!
Last thing Bitcoin needs is people like you posting this shit annoying them and begging for cash.
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:30:30
Downvoted and reported as spam post.
Seriously though I keep seeing the same link copied and pasted into every thread recently.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:00:18
Correct, I will no longer be trading using paypal. In time I may come back and experiment with BTC as I think the idea behind it is brilliant, but for now thats all I was willing to risk (I know its not Bitcoins fault but my own that it has gone)
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:44:33
Who said I was about to spend $500? Also if you look above I believe I said anybody who uses that deserves to lose their money, at what point did you inform me? I came to the comments section to post that and warn others just the same as you, that doesnt then give me the right to beg for money for anybody I have informed.
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:53:03
Just short of that, I think it was £492, im in this long term though so that wasnt really an issue, future purchases will be made on an exchange I just wanted some now lol
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:44:31
What do they do if you just leave the account? Surely if you have another you could just use that and forget about the old one?
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:25:34
Nahhh I wouldnt want the hassle of sending them all back lol, I just thought it sounded nice while I was researching bitcoin and decided to grab it before anyone else :)
And many thanks for the tip! I will be sure to pass it forward!
@_date: 2013-11-30 11:32:04
Who knows? Nobody can predict the future!
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:31:34
Lets be honest, anybody who has done their research and still thinks this is geinuine deserves to lose their money.
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:07:17
Bully you? You seem so mature, I feel sorry for your son tbh. although lets be honest that post is probably made up too.
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:34:40
so panhandling on the internet is a thing now? managed to find the only current downside to Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:13:31
Oh no, I am not saying there is a problem with BTC, I know it was my own fault for trusting Paypal. 
Thats a good list though, I just wish I had read it before lol
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:50:47
Cheers man :D Just gotta work out how to accept it now :P

I have also applied for verification on bitstamp, they need proof of address and scans of documentatiom, Does this make it more secure or should I be wary of sending these details to them?
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:19:33
I can imagine it now, Buys sandwich, and sits down to eat:
2 mins in: Wow this $5 sub only cost me $4.20!
5 mins in: Damn its going down, $5.60 now :(
8 mins in: Wooohoo $1.20 footlong!

I don’t think customers demanding anything from Apple would affect their marketing strategy or payment methods.
They may choose to implement bitcoin at some point if it stabilises and they could see a profit, but I can’t see that for quite some time yet.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:03:47
No, I'm done with Paypal because paypal sucks, I'm done with bitcoin for now because I cannot afford to re-invest until after the new year.
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:51:34
Funny, at the rate Bicoin is currently climbing you could have gone into space with that many!
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:23:25
How do you mean plan on paying paypal back?
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:13:38
I would have thought the Media attention gained recently along with the amount people have invested in bitcoin would drive anybody in retail to consider them first. 
First one to market and begin being widely used for goods wins IMO, remember the old VHS Beetamax (spelling) war, VHS quality was sub par in comparrison but which one do you remember having in your home?
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:17:14
I dont get it? what am I looking at?
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:54:10
I sold some of mine on ebay for a great markup, Just be aware the ebay will chargw 10% in fees and paypal will want their cut. Also be aware that many people will try and claim the payment to be fraudulant and try to get a refund via paypal.
I was smart enough to take screenshots of the transfers and im protected by paypal seller protection so even if the payment was fraudulent I get the funds and the card owner also gets a refund.
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:02:56
This is where I started:
Im still trying to get my head around it all myself but from what I have gathered so far:
1. At present it is unwise mining at the moment due to the complexity and would cost an auful lot in order to gather the gear you would need to make it a viable investment.
2. Although the price of Bitcoin has risen dramatically over the past month/week/ if it gets enough momentum and attracts the right retail outlets it could be worth mega money in the future.
3. In order to purchase Bitcoins you can sign up to markets such as Kraken or Bitstamp.
4. Also be aware the price can go down as well as up much like stocks so only invest in bitcoin what you are prepared to lose if the market was to crash.
