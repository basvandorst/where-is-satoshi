I believe so. But short term it looks to be headed lower. And we are tired of buying the dip. For it to than dip. Been a rough year so far for Crypto prices. 7600 is the line of resistance and its the last line. It needs to close.above this price. If it doesnt we're going under 7k. And that would be bad. Since we already double bottomed. We need Catalysts. Hype.is over. I still believe but we need a run here. We need some big news to get us over this hump. Consensus did nothing. Another nad signal.

Do not leave your btc on any exchange for too long. Electrum is the best wallet for btc.

Bitcoin will be a store of value. Like Gold. At some point you'll be forced to spend your bitcoin. If it does grow to the point where you can buy a car or a house or whatever. People will start cashing in. And if no one spends it'll just keep going up in value. Until they finally do.
