I just tried it and both links go their respective subreddits.

Your inital post was from 3 hours ago. Correct me if I'm wrong, but if it was fixed 24 hours ago and you posted this 3 hours ago. When you tried it, the links would have already been fixed, right?

You do realize r/btc was around before bitcoin cash exisited, right?

Of course they are gonna use it was created when only one coin existed. Actually it matters a lot that the sub existed before BCH existed, that's the whole point. They didn't rip anything off. 
That is a bad analogy. You are starting your soft drink by ripping off. BCH started because there were differences within the community and started by splitting off the main coin. Since there is enough support it has survived, that is nothing like your analogy.

I'm 26 and just got a good job. I'm not gonna invest more for now, even though I want to. I'm getting ready to open a roth 401k through my employer so that will be my next move. Maybe part of that portfolio can be cryptocurrencies too.
The last 3 to 4 months I've read up on cryptocurrencies and I now believe that they will be the currencies of the future.

That's a good point haha.

I'm all in baby! HODL!
@_date: 2016-06-16 17:25:54
Guess I'll take my chances. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 15:46:10
All of my savings are in cryptocurrencies, granted it's only $5000 but it's now worth double that :)

What signals are you looking for to tell you that upward spike might be nearing an end?

Petty move

It will be $0 if they don't figure out a solution to the transaction problem

Hold on for dear life. Don't panic, this is nothing new.

I swear I was there in March of 2012 and one of the casinos downtown was advertising that they would accept bitcoin. At that time I didn't know what bitcoin was and from there I went home, informed myself and became a HODL'er. The rest is history.

That's the key, INVEST AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE! Too many people play with money they can't'y afford to lose and I'm guessing most of the time it doesn't work out.

What is a good personal wallet?
@_date: 2016-07-15 19:53:46
Have also heard good things about breadwallet. Might have to look into it.
