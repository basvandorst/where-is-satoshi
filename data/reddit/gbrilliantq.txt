I asked again, have you ever went to walmart? You pay and it asks you if you want cash back....  It will ask you this even if you buy just a dollar product.  You don't have to take anything back or refund anything. just buy stuff and get cash back for no fee. It even says to do it on the bitpay faq. lol
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:48:01
Sorry for the late response, but have you every got cash back from a store like walmart? It doesn't matter the purchase price. It can be a pack of gum. Or something that costs a dollar, then ask for up to 100 in cash back.  Not, 400 dollars and not saying to return it for cash.... lol

Data center.

My credit union loves my business. Even spoke briefly about mining bitcoin with a csr once.

So what now?

This is a pretty long correction, when will we see gains from the dip from ath?  Feels different to me. But only new and or weak hands would sale now.

When is it going right back up to 19k? Asking for a friend.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:48:11
I did.  2 years ago. Entire thing too.  Bitcoin/Litecoin.  The tax hit was nothing in the grand scheme of things.

Just go ahead and neck yourself.  Or you'll end up swimming with the fishys

They are adding other cryptocurrencies soon. Including litecoin.  I wait til the end of the month and make one large top up to minimize the fees, but yeah its getting alittle out of hand.  Why bitpays network fee increases with miner fees is beyond me. It makes zero sense why their fee would increase while we are the ones paying the miner fee in the first place.

It was branded when Ver became a CEO of a website bitcoin.com.  Which intinially misleads folks new to crypto.

What no mention of FuzeX? Bahhh
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:23:19
I'm mining with two 1080s and a 1060 right now.  Pulling in about 8 bucks a day.  My power is super cheap. 1-2 cents per kwh.  During the night it can dip into the negatives and they pay me to use power. =D 
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:51:33
Bitstamp. I used it in a pinch. Worked great.
@_date: 2017-08-21 02:06:35
I have 319k followers. None paid for.  Followers don't mean jack.

This morning I bought in at 3880, had to verify a card with a selfie.  4 hours later it cleared and I got the bitcoin at 4085..... UGH.  Hopefully I won't have to verify this again....eh
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:10:51
Look into nicehash.  PC's can't mine bitcoin anymore.  You would spend more on electricity.  If you want to mine bitcoin, look at multiple antminer s7 or an s9.  ASICS are kings now.  Back in the day you could mine full bitcoins a day on a laptop. Not even close now. Nicehash mines different altcoins and then automatically deposits the value into bitcoin.   My laptop right now with a i7 6700hq and a 1060 is averaging almost 2 dollars a day.  But thats a laptop.  Are 4 other people going to be using this pc?

I think the turn around for ledgers are getting shorter.  I ordered my nano s 8/11 it'll be here monday. About 2 weeks from france.

Rural IL.  I have a smart meter with hourly pricing.  Instead of paying a flat rate for the entire month or year mine will change throughout the day. At night it's super low.

CC = Credit card.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:06:19
Can you use Bitstamp?  I use it for quick buys.  Fees are what you would expect for using a cc. But it's quick and easy and I've never had a problem.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:52:58
Bought through Coinbase, Gemini and Bitstamp (cc payment) haven't had a problem with any of them so far. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:37:32
Sunday 7am. Price doesn't matter. Unless it drops hundreds then I'll buy more. Never sell.

Glad I kept the free cash coin from the fork.  I'll probably just hold it and forget about it. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:59:32
I'd start to look at service such as bitpay or braintree payments.  We are in the process of accepting bitcoin. I just have to convince my wife first.  
@_date: 2017-08-21 02:27:25
"Even though he has 100k followers" someone else mentioned paid followers. I said I had more and how followers don't mean shit.  Pretty cut and dry. I mean this account has Leo from wolf of wall street saying he is giving away btc. Of course it's a scam.........

@_date: 2017-08-16 08:51:46
I'm married.  I talked about bitcoin so much she said buy it and don't talk to me about it again.  I dca every week and whenever it dips to a level I think is good.  Or just buy it and say surprise...  You know that saying, it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission.
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:02:33
I'll just buy more.  
@_date: 2018-06-16 22:00:23
Its real.  My smart meter and real time pricing sees multiple times a week.

I like Mycelium for android and ledger nano s for hardware.   If you want to have a more durable paper wallet look into Bitkee, they offer titanium cards
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:57:18
I wouldn't look into cloud mining.  It's a pyramid scam.  That's why if you go to any cloud mining sub here or videos about it on yt, you'll see everyone posting their referral links.  It's the only way folks at the top are breaking even. And I do mean the top.  It's better to buy your coin from an exchange or look at nicehash to mine from your pc or build a gpu rig.  Or research asic mining hardware.

Nice Hash.  Mine alts transfer to bitcoin automatically.  Can't mine bitcoin direct with pcs anymore.

There was reason behind bitmain only accepting bch for these past batches of miners. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 03:01:07
I use bitpay now, but will be using FuzeX in July.  Its a crypto smart card. With an epaper display, store 15 different coins and 10 debut/credit cards on one card.
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:26:46
Fees.  You still get that 1 btc out of your example. But on top of that there are fees collected for the convenience of the ATM.   
@_date: 2018-03-29 05:55:21
Paid my bills, bought more miners.  Normal stuff.

Edit: I don't know. Bitstamp was my go to, but they use simplex 
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:15:47
You'd be surprised how many I wouldn't lose.  Or at least, wouldn't notice.  But for up to 1btc a tweet..... tempting eh?

@_date: 2017-09-14 18:14:05
I'm still up.  Buying more everyday. Mining 24/7 I've diversified quite a bit.  BTC will hit under 3k tonight, (Hopefully) With the weekend coming it might level off.  Prices during the weekend are typically lower.  I do know one thing for sure, I'll have more coin after this all blows over. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:22:12
Haven't had a problem with bitstamp.  I use gemini too for quick bank transfers and bitstamp when I want to use a cc to balance transfer with.

Far from the best prices.  My last order of modvigil cost me 192 free shipping using bitcoin.  Took 2 weeks to get. No duds so far.

You're talking about the Fuze card.  FuzeX hasnt been shipped yet to investors let alone for sale for FXT that is.  But you are correct.  My fuze card doesnt work because of the lack of chip.  I have a mock up FuzeX card for my time helping advise during private sale. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 06:33:25
Check out FuzeX. For almost two years they touted as being the smart cryptocurrency debit card, bitcoin, eth, dash....etc all being supported.  After their successful 42m ICO, we get leaked youtube videos from a meeting with Ver and the Fuze team.  Suddenly bitcoin is dropped and bcash is instead offered only.   Min buy in at eth value was over 5k.  Needless to say alot of people were pissed.
