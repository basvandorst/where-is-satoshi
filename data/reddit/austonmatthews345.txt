Lol. Hodl on brothers, this guy just wants to buy your bitcoin for cheap. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:36:56
Holy fuck, you can tell this guy gets the ladies. 
Invest in bitcoin and forget about selling it for the next 8 years, keep adding what you can afford to lose every 2 weeks. 
Omg, should I buy, should I sell is a poor man's game. It's for people that have no lives. 
Wait 8 years. You'll be extremely wealthy.

I'm a little confused by what you're saying, if I buy bitcoin by credit card I thought it was instant? As in I own that bitcoin and can store it away immediately on a hardware wallet. Yes the transaction is pending for them taking the funds, but if my bank were to flag  the transaction and cancel it, how are they getting their bitcoin back when I've already moved it off the exchange? 
Otherwise you're telling me I don't own my bitcoin and coinbase can take it back at any time?

Buy a hardware wallet? 
Ledger Nano S

Lol. It's obviously Christian Bale. Get real bro.

Can you explain their ridiculously high transfer fees? Greed and nothing but greed. I hope we get a user friendly exchange that is pro-consumer and not just some monopoly that is ripping us off.

This is inexcusable in this day and age. Inb4 they stop accepting half their payment options.

I've been reading for hours, and can separate the geniuses from the idiots, at the end of the day their arguments are all speculation. 
Tin foil hat Woody is driving in his newly acquired Lambo as we speak and that's all that really matters. 
Bitcoin has helped me get my shit together. I got a new job, plan on moving out of the basement and dollar cost averaging with what I can afford to lose every few weeks into Bitcoin. It's stories like Woody's that keep me optimistic and inspired. It's helped me to get my life together and I'm sure it's helped many others think about the long term. 
To the moon we go.

I'm reading up on this at the moment, but it seems like a pyramid scheme scam to me. It's going to make early adopters extremely rich, while us showing up late to the party get shafted. Basic economics 101 - when the masses are buying, the few at the top are selling back to them. 
I want to believe but it seems to good to be true.

If I had a time machine I'd go back to 2010 and dump the $40 000 from my dead uncle all into bitcoin, skip college, and I would be a multi millionaire today. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:00:54
I will continue doing reading for the next few days, the whole idea is hard to wrap my head around.

So breaking this down for a Homer Simpson type intellectual such as myself, and correct me if I'm wrong the process would go something like this. 
1. OPEN coinbase interface
2. Buy bitcoin 
3. Transfer the bitcoin address to GDAX 
4. Transfer the bitcoin address to your mobile/hardware wallet for a much lower fee 
I've been reading up on GDAX but haven't seen the interface for myself, but essentially it is similar to coinbase except it is more professional in appearance and has more functionality, but the big words turn people away from using it. 
Could I not just skip steps 1 and 2 and buy bitcoin directly from GDAX, hence avoiding the transaction fees altogether? 
Edit: Gdax doesn't support credit card or bank transfer in Canada so I guess I'm doing the coinbase&gt; GDAX&gt; wallet. Seems kind of tedious the extra step but the % saved over long term would be substantial.

If you're in this for the long haul buy a hardware wallet, specifically a Ledger Nano S. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:34:25
I can see huge migration over to bitflyer in the near future. Wish it entered the Canadian market, you guys are lucky.

Right? Your guess, also known as speculation. 
I'm not a market expert but do you really think the average weak hand has more power to manipulate the market than a billionaire power house?

I buy a lot of my legit products directly from the company that sells the product on Amazon. I do not associate with 3rd party sellers 98% of the time for this very reason, but luckily for disputes Amazon always sides with the buyer. 
Use your head for a second, if you're in this for the long haul and you're going to be investing thousands of dollars into bitcoin do you really want to use a product that could be a knock off or put your security at risk? I know when it comes to buying the Ledger Nano S I am not going to cheap out, I've bought it directly from the seller on their website, paid the insane shipping fees, and essentially bought it for $120 CAD. When it comes to securing your money, bitcoins, assets, and personal belongings there are NO shortcuts.

@_date: 2017-11-29 06:07:06
Hell no I'm hodling, this is money I can afford to lose. If it hits $1 and is declared dead then ill just buy more bitcoin forever leaving it there to rot until maybe there is a revival.
