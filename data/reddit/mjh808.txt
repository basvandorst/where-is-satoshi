Not sure if there's a list, I just see a lot of individual merchants saying they've switched due to fees, then there's things like OpenBazar, Bitpay of course, reports of 1200 restaurants in Denmark, possibly 4500 merchants in India.  It's pretty much BCH's focus right now, a race for adoption.

Good to see this old story on the front page through @_date: 2018-01-19 23:31:56
Clearly it's not just about stealing bitcoin's name to profit or it wouldn't have so many early bitcoin supporters on board with it, it goes back to the scaling debate that started years ago.
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:43:26
Part of the reason for BCH's creation was the likely hood of bitcoin being displaced at the top due to the refusal to scale when most needed, ie. when newcomers try it for the first time and decide to look at alts instead.  That threat still exists, meanwhile BCH is gaining merchant adoption, if LN ever has all its issues sorted and works reliably and cheaply it might make BCH redundant in some respects but the promise of LN isn't going to stave off competition for another 6 months.  I think it's still sensible to remain hedged for now.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:44:23

@_date: 2018-01-20 23:00:03
There was no consensus for segwit, centralized core was able to get their way by cutting a deal and then not upholding their end it and we all know how damaging that has been.
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:15:58
No, they have been reckless in not increasing to 2MB during this period when lightning needs bigger blocks anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:08:51
Graphene, cash shuffle, the re-enabling of opcodes.
You can use other coins for privacy and smart contracts, I was just answering the question about development, the 90% bandwidth reduction from graphene is useful though.
0-conf was used by merchants accepting bitcoin for years without issues, I assumed Litecoin had also adopted RBF but either way, you're comparing the original bitcoin under a different name vs an alt-coin, people already invested their time and money in the former so there needs to be a compelling reason to switch.. Faster block time just means needing to wait for more confirmations anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-14 09:30:05
thanks 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:24:07
"Bcashers" started here.
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:23:15
There's development in block propagation, privacy, smart contracts etc but really there isn't really need for change for some time, it works well right now just as bitcoin did a couple of years ago and 0 conf makes it better than most other options including Litecoin for small in store transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:18:14
No, BCH is the counter-attack.

You get banned here for asking "what did Roger say that you disagree with?"
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:53:44
Yeah I confused Adam Back signing the HKA with the NYA because they're the same thing yet he begged others to drop the latter.  He also agreed to 2, 4 and 8MB block size increases yet that all changed for some reason. Segwit without 2x forced a split anyway with the bonus of a terrible user experience and newcomers looking to alts instead.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:16:01
CobraBitcoin said it, lightning will need bigger blocks anyway.. Core needs to suck it up and do what's needed.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:08:52

Some more info regarding the government's stance on bitcoin in Venezuela. It seems their actions are mostly due to electricity being heavily subsidized.  They are in the process of creating a registry for miners.

You know Xapo only just finished dumping BCH today but feel free to buy back into BTC if you're not just making this shit up - the only threads I've seen there of people saying they're going all in have had a whole bunch of others advise against it, why bother when you can just hold the free bch?  Even Roger says don't to put all your eggs in one basket.

STFU and increase the block size.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:53:16
For starters he said it could cost $50 or $100 and might not show up for hours, days or even weeks but in any case it's quite possible for a transaction with a $100 fee be low priority due to the number of inputs.

I think the main point was that the entry was about her and she didn't have a say in what was written.

He is/was one of the biggest holders of bitcoin, he didn't do it for the money and it's not 'his' way, most early devs and users feel the same about the scaling debate, there's no reason to wait for LN unless you want BTC to be displaced.  
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:15:09
Bigger blocks and a debit card is a better solution.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:25:09
It's why no2x had such support, so many were late to the party so invested in alts instead, obviously they prefer bitcoin doesn't scale.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:34:20
This is quite the campaign you have going, destroying bitcoin by refusing to scale as required while spouting endless propaganda about the backup plan for bitcoin investors at the same time.  It seems holding 50/50 won't be much of a hedge after all.

[where do the donations go?](  etc, obviously still your decision in the end but worth doing IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:45:52

Seen it, nobody expects to use 1GB blocks even though they have been tested thus the mention of a debit card for small transactions.  It's pretty much what the lightning network is except it's simpler and uses half as many on chain transactions.

@_date: 2017-12-19 00:42:07
It is, loading a debit card will use less on chain transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:19:11
He's not lying, it's a problem for merchants.. taken from another thread:
Roger Ver has a business and receives many small tx.
Once he uses all those inputs to create a single output he needs to pay a high fee as it is calculated not by the amount of bitcoins but the number of inputs and outputs (sat/B).
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:48:54
True, it's bizarre how this sub consistently interprets shit in the worst possible way.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:53:08

It's only deflationary because the current inflation rate of 4% is outstripped by demand through mass adoption.  Once we are at saturation point, the deflation rate will probably be like .2% from lost coins and I don't think that is going to stop anyone from spending or investing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:57:07
For starters it's not a scam, look into the history of the divide..  Secondly lightning still needs a block size increase so you should be pushing for that instead.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:32:39
You're right, it wasn't even at $50 when it was regularly stated in forums etc that it will go to 0 or 100k+..  I think most who haven't yet reached their goal would still be holding unless they really needed the money along the way. 
On the plus side, imagine how salty the 21 btc owners will be if it tanks now, lots of stories of.. could have bought a house but needed it just a little higher to retire.

It's only shitty to those who haven't been watching it for years - they believe the propaganda saying that it's propaganda, much like WW2.
“We won this war with atrocity propaganda…and now we will start more than ever! We will continue this atrocity propaganda, we will increase it until nobody will accept one good word from the Germans anymore, until everything is destroyed which might have upheld them sympathies in other countries, and until they will be so confused that they don’t know what to do anymore. When this is reached, when they begin to pollute their own nest, and this not reluctantly but with hasty willingness to obey the winners, only then the victory is complete. It will never be definite. The reeducation demands thorough, steadfast nurture like English lawn. Only one moment of inattention and the weed will break through, this ineradicable weed of historic truth.” – Sefton Delmer, former British chief propagandist, commenting after the capitulation in 1945 to the German expert on international law Prof. Grimm.
“Do not let yourself be disconcerted by the worldwide clamor that will now begin, There will come a day, when all the lies will collapse under their own weight, and truth will again triumph.” Dr. Joseph Goebbels, Berlin, May 1st, 1945.

Most Aussies have 2 accounts including a US account since it's cheaper for digital downloads.

most dips are just people wanting to increase their holding, when the price seems to have reached a peak they sell on any bad news in the hope others will too, most of which are also selling with the intention to buy back cheaper.

still costs too much to top up in australia..
eg. today on coinjar,  it cost $606 USD ($646 AUD) when price on bitstamp was $584 USD.
I'd expect it to be worse though since our international wires cost like 5% - I've no idea how coinjar are selling cheaper than that.

At the moment:
446 USD spot on bitstamp
446 USD spot on CoinJar  (usually like $1 higher)
476 AUD spot on CoinJar
481 AUD *buy
plus 2%
490 AUD (459 USD)
That's 2.9%, I see what you mean about having a buy price instead of just saying the fee is 3% or whatever but that seems a good rate compared to what we're used to in Aus.
I'd love to know how they top up actually - the last time I sent an international wire to an exchange overseas the bank (ANZ) used their own exchange rate which was around .90 USD at the time it was meant to be .95 USD before being slugged another $90 in handling fees.

Bitcoin just isn't easy to exchange for fiat in a lot of places yet.
Right now it seems my best option in Australia is to physically go to a bank to deposit cash before buying from a low volume market with a big spread, if I want to do it remotely I have to wait a day for funds to clear.  Even if I was ok with paying 10% tax it would take a day to clear with coinjar too.
Of course once bitcoin is more widely used, we won't be going to/from fiat all the time.

Most big blockers aren't against side chains either, it just has to be optional.
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:03:35
I do think the BCH camp is right but it would only take an announcement on BTC scaling to make other cryptos irrelevant again and I think it'd be kinda stressful backing one over the other.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:38:10
It's not about trusting anyone, decide for yourself..  here's the business model  of the most influential group of developers  and there's no good reason not to increase to 2MB until off chain 'options' are ready.
I hold 50/50 and I don't really want BTC displaced but let's get real about who's currently running the show.

I think it's dangerous to be put in a position where we are forced off chain and even if that turns out to be unfounded, there's no reason for them not to accept an interim 1MB increase while off chain solutions are worked on.
As for the ex cons and fraudsters, you know that's blown out of proportion, I'm sure Blockstream backers are a whole lot worse.

&lt;snip&gt; that first post was in response to someone being negative about the BCH price and I basically said don't worry about it.  The other one I was stating a fact that most newcomers only care about profit, they probably don't even know how the fed works and would feel more comfortable with banker and government backing than libertarians.  I think you need to keep digging or buy back the BCH you sold so you don't have to waste your time shilling.

A backup plan.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:29:54
It won't be under their control, Core can continue doing their thing with the adopted 2X change.
Bigger blocks are a way to address scaling right now, it's not as bad as those who seek to profit off chain make out and most advocates aren't against side chains in conjunction, there are only up sides for users.  
You know if 2X fails, BCH is looking pretty attractive with low fees and without the 0 conf crippling RBF for merchants.  I'm not sure BTC can maintain top spot if it isn't sorted out soon.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:07:40
That's why BCH exists, some people decided Bitcoin should be slow, have high fees and even removed the 0 confirmation option for low risk transactions so they can  profit from off chain solutions and I don't know why so many are on board with it.  Bigger blocks may not be ideal but it addressed an immediate problem, an off chain scaling 'option' can be sorted later.

Did you read this one?
The 2012 NDAA deemed the United States a "battlefield," as Senator Lindsey Graham put it, and gave the president and his agents the right to seize and arrest any U.S. citizen, detain them indefinitely without charge or trial, and do so only on suspicion, without any judicial oversight or due process. The new Executive Order states that the president and his secretaries have the authority to commandeer all U.S. domestic resources, including food and water, as well as seize all energy and transportation infrastructure inside the borders of the United States. The Government can also forcibly draft U.S. citizens into the military and force U.S. citizens to fulfill "labor requirements" for the purposes of "national defense." There is not even any Congressional oversight allowed, only briefings.

Maybe that's how it came across but based on other videos, he knows ISIS isn't solely Israel, they're just the main benefactor and active supporter.  There's plenty of reason to believe Israelis or at least Jews are involved in Paris though, mostly due to what we learned about Charlie Hebdo but also tidbits such as the Jewish owners of the theater sold just 2 months ago after 40 years of ownership and the Jewish community were warned on the morning of the attack, both stated in Israeli media reports.  I'd rather stick to saying it was just state backed without pointing the finger but false flag terrorism is what Israelis are renowned for and Muslims are their usual target, it shouldn't be ignored.
@_date: 2015-11-19 06:39:27
A couple of things to get you thinking.. when people watch bands, every other person has a camera out recording, why in that case do we only have a single clip of the band that ends as soon as we hear shots?  There should be dozens.  Note: they would already be recording.
The aftermath of the theater shooting showed about 25 bodies on the ground, there was meant to be 89 dead and at least 200 injured in there, where did they go when there was no EMT's on the scene when the picture was taken?  Over all attacks there were 129 killed, over 400 injured yet we saw only about 40 in total.
This was a large scale attack yet we have seen no verifiable injuries whereas we could confirm Beirut immediately, both from CCTV footage as well as the explosion damage.
So bottom line is if people were killed at all, the number was hugely exaggerated.  I know most won't accept this stuff goes on but if you think you would care that it does then look into it as well as past events and always consider who benefits.. Hopefully this helps

I think they do affect the demand though, those that believe bitcoin to be high risk have their limits before bailing out, those that bought at say 400 and held are just waiting for the day to bail when they can finally get their money back.

Well it does stand for Israeli Secret Intelligence Service  but I don't put too much weight into that, the US also had a government department named ISIS.
