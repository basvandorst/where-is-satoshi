Who complaining? I just said what happened to me. Also I held for a good while before selling on a sharp decline &amp; even though it went back up 8% afterwards it's back down to less than what I sold at. Pretty volatile.
I'm new to stocks &amp; I felt like it was prolly overvalued but had invested a smaller amount to more or less learn by doing &amp; I feel as if I'm doing so.

I'm pretty sure anyone can play the stock market under 18 with a cosigner.

Yeah, I'm holding on to my bitcoin investments. I joined up for the ride in January. I'm just putting some in here &amp; there, not on a set schedule or anything.

That 2200 could easily be near 30,000 by the end of this year. The opportunitys are endless. Something must be done, if that means threatening him to send it back or else you'll releasing all his personal info online so be it. Tell him you're going to file a report on him through his ISP, they might be able to help as well.

It's just that kinda day for me, I literally bought into some more bitcoin yesterday @ $575. I also sold out on my stock (yes panic) &amp; it went up 8% in after market trading.

Is there a way to make a paper wallet without booting something from a USB? I actually bought my computer from somebody &amp; HP has a passcode on my BIOS which I can not figure out. So if I would need to get into my bios to switch it back to windows I wouldn't be able to.

It takes many failed attempts to finally figure out what is right.
Wait does that make sense? I don't deal with bitcoin anymore but I never had a problem with coinbase. Not sure why people feel the need to keep supporting these new shady startups.
