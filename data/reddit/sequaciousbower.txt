Yes, YES!!! Thank you friend

It isn't their fault. They want main stream business. Bitcoin needs to go full on mainstream for the shop around the corner to use it. Encourage, advocate, promote, and use where available.

One thing I've seen is that people only pay attention to percentages when they are negative. Otherwise, Bitcoin is a scam
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:31:48
I agree that would be a great short term fix.  
Great for adoption - it's similar to what you're already doing. But pretty soon, I'm Bitcoin world, that will be surpasses by soemthing even more magical. We need things like that though to drive use, IMHO

S.N. even talked about the need for an extra layer to be added to allow for the mass adoltion and the massive amount of transactions. Yeah, some segwit altcoins are fast, but true Bitcoin with layers such as the lightning network and things I can't even fathom right now will allow for the world to use millions and billions of transactions a day on Good ole Bitcoin.

This comment alone makes me want to use the service. I appreciate looking to make something truly helpful not just begging for money. Wish there was still a tip bot

I'm not going to respond to all three of your comments just this one. I would say there is a difference between being lazy and being interested in a positive future. Key word there being future. Although I could use crypto for multiple things online I am not in a position currently where I can live in crypto; but I think that is a real possibility. As such, I'm not going to cash out and waste possible future larger returns. That's the same thing as saying, well why don't you just take a payday advance on your paycheck. 'Are you just so lazy that you're going to wait for your paycheck.'

Keep up the hodl'ing friend

I by no means am trying to spread FUD. Sorry didn't mean for that. Just sharing news 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:51:40
If you bought off of a service like coinbase or bittrex and you had a verified account they could theoretically pull that record I would assume
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:56:30
Please sir may I have some more. I have only had but one bit 
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:32:40
I love me since Bitcoin because I  believe in technology. A dollar bill is not advanced and bans are ancient. Time for change

block 528249 has is eerily similar to the genesis block, which is either random, or was named specifically. It get's complicated, but a few of the implications here are that this was created with a quantum level computer, the fact that it was able to determine the digits so closely, or that satoshi traveled back in time. both far fetch, but the odds of it being randomly named that would take about 5000 years......

Read the tweet thread. First set of 0s
@_date: 2018-06-21 05:23:52
This should help too 
@_date: 2018-06-21 01:46:00
As scattered as it is,  has the best thread on this i could find

This guy!!
Knows more than me

Real Bitcoin is just like [Apple pie]( 
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:39:21
Love the note.
One extra asterisk I would add:
*You only lose if you sell lower than you bought. It's in a sight dip, the 'high price' you bought in at will be over taken soon. Eventually 7,800 will be a dip number
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:20:16
He who smelt it, dealt it. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:03:03
It doesn't. I was simply talking about rapid growth. 
A poorly stated joke. Should have included the ole  - /s
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:57:09
Excellent! Thank you!!
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:35:13
I just skimmed through this comment through and I think this is the best Reddit interaction...Ever!
Thank you kind strangers for spreading happiness through the world. Thank you Bitcoin for bringing people together.

Maybe I'm being a little naïve or too simplistic, but isn't that the nature of Moore's law?  ��
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:55:31
H M M M M
Should I buy the dip? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:39:08
Apple, Amazon, Bitcoin - Top to bottom Incase you were wondering 
It's not a perfect comparison, but when people say the growth is unrealistic, or a Ponzi scheme, or fake, etc, ask them how they feel about Amazon and Apple. 
Any other good examples?
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:09:03
Fair point
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:50:19
[aww shucks you]( 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:53:43
So you're saying we're going to $3?
@_date: 2018-04-08 05:37:16
I thought that account was fake and the i was an upside down exclamation mark
