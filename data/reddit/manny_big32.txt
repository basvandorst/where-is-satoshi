How could you know about it, say it wouldn't happen to you, and not wait until the tx was actually confirmed at your bank!!..?
Not trying to be a jerk.. but seriously?  Was the seller pressuring you?  I think Local Bitcoin sellers should list if they allow for a completed tx wait-time only, otherwise hit the road...

Sad that this is a warning more than a reveal.. 
Wake up people, KNC took all their good deeds in delivering 28nm somewhat globally in 2013..  and used it for great evil in 2014.  (Lying and creating centralized mining data centers for themselves)
We've seen this time and time again.  Why do the right thing for the long run, when we can profit greater in the short run. 
They've already announced they're no longer delivering miners... Don't be one of their sheep.. for as long as they deem it profitable.  I'm sure cloud services will be phased out eventually too.

I upvoted you because you have a point.. 
But I would say you're neglecting how there could be crossover with technological advancements when creating better, more efficient ASICs, ones we may not see today in PCs, who knows what processes and engineering techniques could be invented when there's incentive and tons of money being thrown at ASICs.  
You wouldn't necessarily correlate Nasa's experiments and inventions for what is needed in zero G, with anything we would need on earth.. in gravity.. but the expandable universe of science and thought surrounding what is invented for Nasa grows exponentially for everyone, not just the astronauts in space..

With all due respect, I have no idea why you were upvoted so much, don't get me wrong, if your bank is so equipped with an ATM outside on in accessible vestibule, most can accept checks, deliver fiat, accept fiat etc.
(I'm sure that accounts for like 20% of all banks worldwide)
Now.. When the bank is closed.. Try to get more than.. $200 fiat.. Try to do anything account related.. Don't dare use your Debit card in another state or go on a vacation when your bank is closed.  Good luck trying to get it worked out when all the security "features" have kicked in.
The point is, you should be able to go into a bank and take out all your money at any time, if you so choose to.  This is how fooled we've all become, it's sorta like.. Oh it's ok, it's safe in there...  This is one of the reasons BTC will reign, because you are in fact in control of all of your funds.

You're saying a lot of things that can't be argued, but that don't correlate or prove your finality argument either.
"math is proof" umm ok.. sometimes. sometimes math leads to an incorrect answer too.. that's called experimentation..
All of that doesn't mean there isn't a way to break sha256. you keep repeating that the proof of work needed for sha256 means there's no where to have a solver.

Not a dumb question. 
They couldn't buy "all" of them.. but they could buy a lot, which would drive the market up.. Actually. But.
You could be a conspiracy theorist and think Bankers **have been** buying up coins slowly.. Over time. Off chain too. now. (This is where you would have to ask what are bankers real intentions since they would have a valuable commodity.. are they truly threatened or willing to assimilate?  I would assume threatened)
They could corner the market so to speak, sell off, and buy back more cheap.. coordinated.  This is basically what whales do but it would be on a much larger scale.
Or they could try to "crash" the market, by selling them all at once across a few exchanges.  This wouldn't kill the technology.  It would cause a stir though.
There is a way to "burn" bitcoins so they're provenly destroyed.

yes. continually taking the CC clearance time stance, only helps support some of the argument that 10 minutes is fine.  If you've ever been waiting for confirmations to trade, standing at a BTC ATM, or to buy something (some businesses want a 3 confirmation minimum) you know what this is like.. it's stressful, nauseating slow... YES it is. You can find yourself asking the question.. how is this fast? how is this the new way to do currency?? yes overall compared to CC and charge backs, it's better but the block times can be.. 10 min. 8 seconds. 50 min.  it's grossly inconsistent.  and to say it's not continually is just a bold face lie.. or you've just never had the bad luck of having to wait 40 minutes for one confirmation.

Hard forks have been done before. by Satoshi himself. I'm not arguing it should be done, just if Bitcoin is to scale without having the stigma, "the crypto that raises fees".. 
Lets not forget a core dev (can't remember who) admitted to trying to contact Satoshi via his .gmx account to ask him his opinions on hard forking again.. so clearly they're "thinking" about it. and a directive needs to be made, which is what i meant by obvious.. like it's out there but we're pretending it's not.
It's important to be careful.. who knows how Satoshi might take having it forked again, he's holding ≈ 1 Million BTC, so it's kinda important to not upset him.   
I think everyone rolling over for regulations is going to leave more of a sour taste with him though. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 06:27:56
I definitely agree with the skyrocketing of hashrate.. which can better be put as the centralization of hashrate...  those who are mining the most coins have to pay those electricity bills..  I've been bearish everytime I've seen the hash skyrocket, 2K, 3K coin sell-offs are common, and I'm sure I know where they come from... it's proved to be good for trading.. usually.. don't hold me to that. heh 
No matter how hard KNC plants try and convince they're "securing" the network.. Bitcoin works best when it can be as decentralized as possible, at all levels.

I love how you posed a question.. and then answered it, AS me.. lol
Who said that??
It always has been KNC.  We used to watch Petahash Addresses from Eligius known to be KNC drop there and then the exact same Petahash show up as "unknown".. Minutes later..  
Don't try and confuse Ghash stupidity with KNC.  KNC were caught jumping in and out of solo mining awhile ago..  Even though they claimed to only be mining 5%.. haaaa. Sneaky.  Unfortunately a lot of people are onto them.  Just not you. Mmm I wonder why.
The topper was when their spokesman on BCT just disappeared when these lies came to light..
All you have to do is look at the BCT thread on KNC.  I guess you mighta missed it.. You know..  around late Dec. 13 till.. you know about August 14?  lol.
When they decided to just hoard all their equipment built with the funds and the promise they wouldn't spike the Hash..  It's all well documented.  This isn't even mentioning the lies about Neptune.. Titan.. etc.

I have to agree, bits seems like an easy go-to.. it just doesn't work across the board.. 
I liken it to everytime I see "HD" in a forum, and have to check to see if they're referring to a resolution, a quality, or a drive, HDD..   Only this name confusion would be carrying weight, value, and could be a major annoyance.
There needs to be a universal name that cannot be easily confused with so many other uses of the word bit, bits, etc.  
I remember someone promoting Sat/Sats?  Doesn't sound the best.. but it isn't that bad either, at worse it's the past tense of an english verb that would not be easily confused, and keeps things somewhat in the realm of Bitcoin, Satoshis, etc.

mBits for me. mBTC.
1000 mBits, 1 BTC. simple.
everything else requires serious brain power. ;) jk.
1 Bit is .00033 USD...
1 mBit is 33 cents. Mmmm which one is easier..? from buying a candy bar to a car.. 
We could have a convo about how there's different currencies than USD. but just as a base point.
my only guess as to why people push bits is they like to live in their future world where BTC is worth $100k USD.
They probably buy big cars to feel adequate too.
I say payment processors should adopt *mBit* and *Bit*, and when Bit is easier to use, 5 years from now, heh, we just naturally use that more.

Now if that were a CURRENT US Secretary or PBOC director, it would be ACTUAL news. why? Because they would actually have power and influence to do something about it.  Not just an opinion.
If you're making money off pumps cool. but when exchanges start pumping. it questions their stake, holdings, and is bothersome.
why?  Well first off, history has shown us exchanges could just make up bots to pump or dump as they seem fit. Willy Bot.

Clearly it's not a be-all end all.. As I said.. don't take me up on it.  
The last (this week) difficulty/price round would prove that, you didn't have to go back so far..
The point isn't that the difficulty skyrocketing is linked to price, it's who is making all the hash.. and what are they doing with the coins..  (it's not difficult when you have centralized data centers with electricity bills) but thanks for completely missing the point.
Further more, I wasn't going back to the beginning of Satoshi with the bearish comment.. last October to December, Karpeles was somehow a beloved individual..  KNC was shipping Jupes and Sats across the world.. and mining.. Taking profits to have more mining.. and to develop unicorns.. Now they have data centers in iceland and you can pay to be a part of their cloud..heh... I mean comparing apples to Skynet..  Bro.

trading speculation.  Centralization of mining. (miners having to sell off their week's mined coins to pay huge electricity bills/employees)  many things. 
This will really drive your head mad..even Black Friday will probably bring the price down a bit... if companies are instantly selling BTC for fiat.
The day BTC is deemed as worthy as fiat by big companies, where they want to keep it to pay employees, etc..  (makes sense since it's deflationary) that's when you'll see a shift.. well. maybe not "see" it.. probably will happen slowly over time.
@_date: 2014-09-04 19:43:07
q-1, some people who actually see how ridiculously catastrophic the centralizing of mining is to Bitcoin, agree with you.
I always go further and say it's the one aspect I don't believe Satoshi could have accounted for, despite his great genius, a few select companies, and one in particularly, Skynet-ing their way to the top so quickly.  Data Centers and such could have been foreseen, but the thought that individual mining would be pretty much dead in less than five years I think would have surprised even him, and is counter-intuitive to the protocol.
If this guy arguing your points, isn't a paid shill for KNC i'd be surprised, "securing the network"... centralizing and creating giant data centers is the surest fire way of NOT securing the network..  
ON top of the countless lies KNC and pretty much every other mining company has ever made, they're the crookedest bankster-like people of Bitcoin, anything else positive said about them is smoke screening.
Lets just make this link a sticky everytime..
Neither of these even speak to the horrid affairs of how they came about funding their neptunes.. I mean their data centers... I mean in their solo mining for 6+ months..

At the very least to sooth anyone's concerns their official twitter has been hacked.  why? What if there were any malicious download link to appear there, that could be compromised.
At best, to let people know you don't belong to archaic destructive beliefs in a multi-national, multi-race community of thinkers and innovators.

This is very interesting, and important to raise awareness to...
but the fact that you don't have KNC listed on here is odd..?  they were at about 15% last year...  Their "pie" is only a percentage of what they actually mine. They're sneaky, and lets not forget mine at Eligius' pool and others too.

difficulty is still up 75% from August 2014. 
Lets be honest, "someone who bought" hasn't been viable for about 12 months, since KNC cutoff shipping 28nm, 20nm was delayed 8 months and most customers were p*ssed and wanting to be refunded..
The flatness is all due to mining not being **as** profitable for the giant data centers and they're slowing turning off/on,  turning back on when it suits them.

"3."  Is that a joke? Every ASIC company has been mining since 2013, selling pre-orders to mining equipment is just a way to fund their next project, the money is in the solo mining, or centralized pool mining, as long as the price stays profitable, 
KNC has been "just plugging them **all** in" since Jan. 2014.  
My guess is KNC and others did have to unplug a few a couple months ago when the price dropped, you saw Neptunes finally, etc.  
That and the hundreds of people realizing their Jalapenos are no longer contributing, caused the small rises of the last few rounds..
I do think there will be a time where the difficulty takes a small dip, but that's gonna require unique events to happen simultaneously.

agreed that money is centralized.. so that's why it's okay that Bitcoin mining is becoming centralized??  
Bitcoin works well in the hands of the many... not of the few. which is what is happening.
And again this is **not** a 51% argument!!!
If *"miners collectively going against their own self interests"*  suggests that.
The reason that Bitcoin works in the long run is because it is decentralized, saying miners going against their self interests doesn't cover stupidity and centralized threats... like..
Government interference..  Shutdowns.. Power Loss.. Natural disasters.. and the many other unforeseen reasons you don't want just a few giant data centers, running the network.
...but the point is lost if the thought is.. just crap on Bitcoin.. what I and many are saying is.. how do we fight this?  Well with Bitcoin the politics are answered in the code.. ;)

@_date: 2014-11-22 22:33:37
I feel the "legitimate criticism" gets squashed a lot too. 
Either purposely or not. For example, some of us have been warning about Mining Centralization, for awhile, and how dangerous it is for the Bitcoin network. and we are almost always downvoted and spun into arguments about 51% attacks.  
Which is not the argument a lot of us are having.  Even when the CATO guy was talking about Mining Monopolization, everyone immediately discredited it as being a 51% attack argument..
Mining is becoming more centralized, the blocks generated are then more centralized.  Does it really take a genius to see how dangerous this is without being muddled with arguments about 51% attacks...
Having fun with these 10:30 average finds this week? that's us down -1%..
Extrapolate that out much further were one or two huge data centers to go down.. for 2016 blocks.  and remember, that crazy high difficulty would have been made by one of the giant data centers, so were one to go down or taken offline.. 2016 blocks would be a long long time.  Hypothetically. in the future.

MMm fair enough that at a certain point yes, there are only so many coins in circulation, but to try and figure out how many are in and out of circulation as to know were one holding what they really have.. seems impossible. only if people demanded complete transparency from exchanges?. this gets into regulation and a whole cluster bomb of problems.
I mean isn't the BTCe exchange still anonymous?  It gets silly to try and pretend we know what is being held truly, and what is being "cooked up"..
We got off of the OPs point about Mining companies with exchanges, but I don't see that far off for mining companies. BTCchina mines now. just saying.

do you think exchanges have all the Bitcoin they say they have too?  (Doesn't seem like a stretch to think a company like KNC would lie about their coins too. Lets not forget they already have a wallet, and a newspaper.)
My guess is not, and others have calculated looking at addresses where no movement has been made for years, 70% worth. they say definitely not.  
I don't see much difference between cooking the books and lying about your coin reserves, well one is backed by FDIC. 
It's probably why some exchanges don't do thorough audits, and even if they do do an audit, it doesn't mean they can cover the spread were a whale to come on and try to buy a bunch of coins..  This is probably why a lot of exchanges mysteriously get "robbed" or disappear..
@_date: 2014-05-20 17:21:33
I responded to someone who said the same thing months ago... What BFL did was rip people off, what KNC did was rip people off, and actually cause(s) harm to Bitcoin's network... (wait that's not possible!?) 
They monopolized the hash through lies, then began solo mining, and have been selling BTC for profit driving the price down..  Not to mention having 30%+ of the hash rate centralized, has serious negative potential to the network, were one centralized power to go down, after having driven up the Difficulty to astronomical proportions.. Well.. It would suck. let's just say that.
When I say harm the network, it would be more of a nuisance, but imagine having one more issue with block times for couch haters to grasp on to.
It's one aspect I don't believe Satoshi could have imagined.. he coulda envisioned huge data centers perhaps.. but not one that monopolized it so quickly with very little competition..
again.. KNC can't be blamed for their success, but they can be and should be held accountable, by gaining the revenue for that success by lying to their customers.
Will any of this matter in a couple years? hopefully not.. but they had a solid 6+ months of centralized hash gained through lies, centralizing hash through their giant data centers..  I for one will never deal with KNC or any of their partners again.

2016 blocks... that's why. 
Point is. Self regulating yes, but after a long damn time if it were to go "down"..  Giant data centers solo mining, equals centralization, equals bad.. Imagine a company like KNC having one of their Data Centers go down.. they're at about 14% of the entire network right now.. then 2016 blocks later, we might be back to about 10 min. a block.
@_date: 2014-12-30 01:51:10
No one has ever really pushed that..
it's actually the opposite, huge spikes represent centralization of mining.
Simpler.. some huge data center turned on a row of 20nm. because the price pushed back to 330$.  and *they* deemed it profitable for a few days. (it's like putty in their hands)
Centralization of mining isn't bitcoin doomed, but when you think of the many consequences to having evolved from distributed mining (Satoshi and Hal) back to it again (Giant Data Centers), it's pretty bad, and could be a back breaker.

I think that quote you attributed is for another Mining Hardware company.
The bloomberg article has Sam Cole's quotes.. 
It is interesting how some of the article was... () redacted..changed..a few days later. 
My guess is KNC said to bloomberg.. hey we're still selling controller boards.. to try and stifle the flames..
It seems KNC forum Admin tried to squash these quotes and had Bloomberg change "some" of their article.. 
Simply put Sam Cole saying “When we don’t have these customers buy our hardware it becomes a different business model.." 
Whether unintentional or not. it's pretty clear to anyone with a brain what he's forecasting when saying.. "When we don't have these customers"
...not to mention the whole damn article is him saying there's a 2 Billion dollar mining race going on in the next few years.. that's from selling their mined coins, not cloud memberships..

There is no "ban" but there also was no statement made by the PBOC saying "we **won't** ban Bitcoin"..
It's been the same stance as forever with China, only turned up a notch.. They're basically making it very hard for any exchange in China to work with banks in China. 
This has big effects which we've seen, but the statement that has been quoted incorrectly to try and pump it back up, was actually the PBOC saying they "**can't**" ban Bitcoin, obviously, no one can.. but this was translated and repeated and made the front page of as we "won't" ban Bitcoin, implying they're not gonna do anything to hurt the innovation and trade of Bitcoin.

BFL has no clue. true, but the point isn't only his own, the difficulty is skyrocketing, mining has become less profitable, and we're seeing more and more centralization of mining, along with cloud services which could or could not be ripping you off.

it's been discussed a lot. it's just usually knocked down by the bulls as unimportant. 
You're treading on stuff that Satoshi set in place purposefully.. so the Bitcoin faithful don't take lightly to that.. the average 10 minutes I'm sure was thought out for awhile. he wanted confs to take enough time to go across the globe to fight attacks.
I've had 1 conf take over an hour before..  kinda flies in the face of the money on rails...
I've had 6 confirmations take 2 hours before... so yea. that's some time to go have a "cup of coffee"... waiting to hand over some car keys..
Tx shows up quickly but the question really becomes important when we start talking about smart contracts.. 
imagine smart door locks for example. you arrive to the door, now waiting 6 confs till you can get into the vacation apt. you've rented.. hopefully it's not in a bad part of town, middle of the night.. and you haven't been traveling all day and just want to rest.. waiting for 6 confs in that scenario could be a pain in the a$$, now extrapolate that out a million times to users burdened by similar waiting times.. again is it a killer? no. but is it the best we can do?
Is getting into a locked property a small risk, 1 conf, or a big risk, 6 confs..  Guess which one the property owners are gonna take..
sidechains might help here. if we think of them as smaller higher speed gears, pegged to the bigger main gear.  But we start talking about trust.. in a supposed trustless system.
I think those smaller gears could actually overpower or disengage the need or use of the main blockchain. so i find them to be dangerous.
They could be pegged to the Bitcoin blockchain, but their "worth" could actually be more than bitcoin.
People will argue this to no end, but there's nothing written in stone, or that can't be forked...

has anyone postulated that perhaps the banks (5 billion market cap is nothing for something with a potential to be a real threat)
actually bought a bunch of coins Off Chain.. and are now attempting to crash the market by selling them at a loss? I mean it wouldn't take much.. And I wouldn't put it past them.. Conspiracy theory for sure.. but it would be great and will only strengthen Bitcoin if and when it bounces back again.

They're shutting it down because they (Chase) don't want to be associated with porn stars, which in itself is hilarious, "drug cartels are okay, you know guys who go and kill women and children while they're sleeping, those people are fine"...

I just want to add, the scariest part about the 2016 blocks, is that the difficulty gets higher and higher from these centralized powers, which makes the outcome more and more grim, were one to fail, hopefully competition picks up for mining equipment, I don't think Satoshi could have forseen one or two Asic companies becoming monopolized powers this quickly.

really i'm not against the word bit(s) as much as I am trying to figure out how much bits are..  the only time I go that far right to left, sats etc... is when trading alt coins. 
But *that* is a learning curve we could all overcome I guess.  
Millibit is such an easier starting point to figure out for day-to-day stuff.  I do think millibits (mBTC, *em-bits) can coexist with uBTC, has a nice balanced look.

No. It re-targets every 2016 blocks.. that is not a "delay".. A lot of us have been warning that centralization is bad for Bitcoin, here is just another reason..
Anyone thinking 2.16 million watts is what Satoshi thought of as being decentralized, peer-to-peer mining is fooling themselves..  
Simply this, all it takes is a huge data center to go down.. (think in the future when it's even worse, 3-4 data centers run Bitcoin's mining and cloud services, which is where we're headed by the looks of the last year alone) and we're looking at serious long block finds for 2016 blocks.. Why? 
Because those giant datacenters unto themselves, have driven the difficulty soo high, it's like being out in the ocean, on a huge dead yacht, with a paddle.. so to speak..  that's not a delay.  If the banking system has an outage. people complain, gets some reimbursements blah blah.. 
If and when Bitcoin network has like 30+ min. average block finds for awhile.. The internet of money.. Money on rails.. etc.  Customers who have to wait for confirmations, before being approved for a loan.. contract to be finalized.. entry to their new apartment.. etc.. are gonna be.. pissed.
Perhaps sidechains can help here.. prob. not since they'd be pegged to the blockchain.

Yes you explained your and many individual's bank practices very well, thanks.
Well except for the "take out all my money" part.. most people don't do that.. You just made bankers shiver..
Unfortunately your situation is a hypothesis for you and you only.  Meaning, if everyone tried to do what you just described, guess what would happen.? Think Cypress..  
Have you heard of Fractional reserve banking...? or are you just choosing to ignore that, to sorta make an argument here? heh...
How about you and 10 of your friends go and try to do that at your local branch, let me know how friendly that bank you walked into on your own free will treats you then..
Now back to reality on how the global effects of centralized banking really effect people.. not the microcosm example of what you described, Germany asked for their gold back from the Fed.. guess what happened? The Fed said well.. Mmm ok. by 2020. we **should** be able to give it back..  You know the gold blocks you entrusted to us on your own free will.. etc. takes 6-7 years to count, right..?  Not trying to convolute things but describing your situation as if it helps an argument that banks "work", flies in the face of what a 100 years of failed centralized banking has done.

Even Andreas on Joe Rogan, called what was happening at Gox, "a ponzi scheme".
Tux was essentially driving the price up internally, which was great for them, they could pay off old traders and entice new traders.  Sound familiar?
People still argue this despite the glaring evidence of fraud, stupidity, bots, and gross price disparity.. before it came apart at the seams. surprising.  My guess is Karpeles is still lying about "losing" those coins.  
Just like Neo&amp;Bee lied. Just like Ryan Kennedy(Moolah) lied. etc..

"somebody did this".. I haven't heard anyone discredit Satoshi coming out of the woodwork after a few years, seemingly to help that poor guy not get kidnapped or something.. with the "I'm not Dorian". My guess either someone hacked his p2p account, recently, and is planning on some quick extortion while it lasts, or Satoshi's identity has been compromised.
Ok I guess it is now being questioned on BCT, whether the "I'm not Dorian" was genuine on p2p.  I think that's a bit of a leap to say it was not. Seemed like a nice thing to do for the guy.
Although perhaps posting that compromised something.  That post on p2p reeks of petty extortion tactics though.  It's a nice warning, and a threat, a bit odd, etc.  I'm thinking they gained control of his email and are going to try and do any scare tactics they can.

I mean I could venture a guess but there's no definite answer, only that it would take longer which means a slower network, I don't think anyone wants slower blocks and confirmations.. it's already too slow in my opinion.   Many can argue this and there's some fair points.

I find it odd that a company would roll out an exchange (which they'll surely seek regulated status with), in such a bull-ish, moon-like way.

The fact this is still being argued and/or downvoted tells you how resistant people are to common sense. 
I look at Bitcoin as pre-2013 and post-2013.  
Mining is distributed and becoming more and more centralized..  Although it started this way.. it did briefly find itself in a decentralized phase of mining.. 
This phase was destined to fail.. (Mining companies getting greedy)
The beginning being centralized and then distributed wasn't as crucial, because the value wasn't forcing sell-offs, and the risk and consequences of loss of significant hashing power was nominal.
This only takes common sense.
My predication awhile ago was the value will get low enough for giant mining companies to begin valuing customers and selling hardware again.  This has started happening slightly...
although the return of centralized mining is an inevitability. as price rises or profitability is met, mining companies will again be hording hardware.. centralize mining. and the circle of distributed mining will repeat itself.

That's great for everyone in BTC.  People who are in cash should take a loss..?  Or should they make that demand for coin rise.. by buying coin? heh  A bigger loss.
The worst case scenario for those in cash. Buy back in BTC. price then dumps huge before getting onto another exchange and transferring back to cash.  (if that was your intention pre-freezeout, bearish)
Good case scenario for those in cash. Buy back in BTC. already at a loss from when exchange froze. about $10 difference as of now.
Get onto another exchange and trade back to cash. and hope the simple fact that you bought BTC back at stamp didn't raise the price too much. (If everyone does that..it will make the coin more in demand..)
For day traders this might be nominal. for big whales this could be a big deal.
Hence the thinking of a lot who lost big with Gox too.  The Goxxing continues...
This is why these exchanges getting hacked IS such a big deal. it takes whatever "playing field" those are on and flips it on its side..
For everyone at a loss with cash, and who do not want to feed into the loss by buying BTC, they could withdraw via bank wire, but the wire transfer fees could make this a bad option for you.
My guess is price drops a bit from big whales who didn't get a chance to cash out before freeze-out. We'll see.

truth. it can't be solved. I do have some ideas but it never goes further than punishing miners, which would never go over well.. they're simply too big to fail now.
there are alt-coins that try and be asic resistant.
here's the harsh reality as I see it.  I predict as mining becomes unprofitable it will in fact enter a period of general decentralization again. 
(say more than 100 giant hot spots of mining across the globe rather than say the 10 we have now)
this will happen until mining becomes more profitable again, and we will once again be burdened with centralized distributed mining and all the negatives of centralized mining.
I think of it as a vicious circle destined to repeat itself over and over again because of greed.

Stamp people who were already looking to dump.. had to wait a longgg time to get into fiat. and even when they reopened they couldn't get fiat out.. had to wait three more non-business days.. that's quite a dam of coin sellers backing up...  I doubt we're done.

Has anyone discussed whether sidechains would always inherently be pegged to Bitcoin..? 
For example, is there a possibility for a sidechain to become strong enough to no longer need Bitcoin chain, and simply...disengage? I don't know enough about it but from looking at the diagrams, it seems possible.

sha256 starts with a constant.  unsolved prime numbers are known to the universe, but not to us.. yet. 
but to pretend an algorithm that starts with a constant, created by the NSA, couldn't have been created with a solver is not a certainty, and not as you describe. 
eliptical curves are another story, but that's for for addys with transactions, we'd still be in a lot of hurt were sha256 breakable and unknowingly broken.  Of course not throwing out paranoia, just saying cuz you talked to some math/comp-sci/NSA guy.. doesn't mean it's not possible.

Did you just send a link that proves centralization is happening to try and make a point?...   
If you can point at a pool chart and show less than 10 points of failure in a global network, you can't claim it's decentralized.
And I guess you're the guy who thinks KNC really only has 8% too right? They were close to 20% early 2014.. before 20nm...  Take a longgg look at that unknown slug..
Guess you're unaware they've been mining on Eligius and on other pools too?

I don't know what you're saying.  That is a direct quote from above, and is simply wrong, not "analysis"... the time line is completely off, unless you think it was an "inside" job..  Which would be opinion.. 
The "news" (started as emails to customers and a warning on the stamp home page), not withstanding some warnings about deposits the day before, which was barely on the radar, and was still well after the low of $255 Stamp price..  That waterfall started way back on Jan. 2nd.
It was not in relation to the dump (AFAWK, unless you know something we don't?) 
but you've posted twice about articles by the same writer, so I'll assume it's you..

We're pumping Russia getting into BTC again.. ? Highest daily volume of BTC/RUB this week at BTCe. 90 BTC..
Lets not forget that volume counts for buying AND selling..  This story is rehashed once a month. 
Localbitcoin volume is peanuts and probably more due to Russia blocking Bitcoin related websites.. 
If exchanges are blocked and Russia was really into BTC. you would see it reflected in volume much higher.

Not disagreeing BFL was first in screwing customers. but KNC was leaps and bounds more devious in their "ultimate" plan..

Funny how he just followed KNC's playbook....
Gotta be honest.. i remember reading that.. we were all posting on this subject a lot in the KNC thread on BCT.  Way back in Dec. 2013.. it was obvious something wasn't right.. when they refused to sell anymore 28nm (cuz of their friendly agreement to buyers lol) but were mining with them.. and far surpassing their other agreement to not mine more than 5%... again another lie.
Who woulda thought someone would just follow KNC's game plan and create a little mini fraud empire from it...
Thanks again KNC.

Oh great. I'm in a troll vortex...
How can I face any of your *facts* when you've started with a premise that is invalid.  
So statements of speculation based on a bad premise... should be faced as facts.. no thanks lol
"The current chart" at Blockchain.info, as I already said isn't accurate. i.e. KNC is one entity spread through out that chart... Not just the KNC "slug" which you seem so moronically attached to and haven't given one actual argument to counter.
You've purposely spun your last 2 arguments ignoring that it is **already** distributed and centralized.  SO again your points are moot.
It isn't a fact when saying "it's trending towards" that's called speculation, and anyone with any sense of history of mining in Bitcoin would know to be pretty dim speculation.

It sounds like they listened to what some of us were saying. 
Coinbase posting a rocket and a moon with a timer...
for a one commodity exchange is a PR wrecking in the making.  If this dumps harder.. well you get the point.
Why would you presume BTC will rocket to the moon.. On an exchange trading BTC *and* cash.?
Traders will always believe they want volatility both up and down. 
This is a cool image to represent bulls and bears in BTC space.

complete guessing here... 
but i've surmised for awhile that Bitpay is holding BTC..  
even last Black Friday for example. even if abysmal.. there should have been a slight dip in price and a rise in volume, and there were neither, this to me just doesn't make sense, unless payment processors like Bitpay are holding BTC. (If they have enough capital to allow them to hold would be another question)
This is good at keeping whales trying to capitalize at bay.. 
and a smart risk when the price is up or rising. not so good when the price. is. well...

for every reason posted. there's 10 other reasons. the point is. there's many reasons, not just one.
I did predict the margin call at stamp (although China was selling all day yesterday) saying there would be big sell offs simply from those who routinely sell having to wait nearly a whole week to have access to, and then another 3 days (while BTC traded) till the banks opened. this causes a dam like effect.. and some fear...uncertainty..and doubt.. and rightfully so, by the way..

No the pie chart you've posted 3 times in this one thread doesn't fit your narrative.
Mining wasn't *more* centralized in the past. It was as centralized as it could be... 
As in one point of failure. Satoshi. 
It then became distributed.. Satoshi and Hal. and others.  The network had little value where capitalism and profitability would drive greed and centralization, and failures wouldn't carry great consequences.
It then had a brief phase of decentralization before the ASIC Revolution, and has been distributed ever since.

Please do not for a second believe Sam Cole cares about Bitcoin or its users, or its ecosystem, or other miners, at all...  And I would question any proclamations he makes.
Simply put he's one of the architects to the centralization in mining that we see now.  And it didn't have to be that way, except, greed.
KNC started with all their shenanigans over 2 years ago.  
Secretly mining with machines they promised to customers, going against their written claims and flat out lying to customers three times. 
This was even before the Neptune debacle.
The result we now have in China.. having a majority in mining was long predicted by myself and others right here on reddit (funny how Sam mentions reddit)  When no one (without being downvoted to hell) would check and question the building of large (Node Pole) centralized mining data centers.  
Sam wanted all the power, and it's hilarious they don't have the biggest piece of something they wanted.. They were once at about 20-25%.
(Sam Cole Bloomberg, “There’s still going to be $2 billion, at today’s price, mined in the next few years,” Cole “That’s a lot of cash that’s up for grabs and we’re going to do our best to take a decent chunk of it.”)
He doesn't and didn't care about Bitcoin, he cares about cashing out Bitcoin, for the most profit, and that mindset helped to destroy in the process, decentralization.

One of the signs was when Black Fridays never showed dips.. even if abysmal for sales.. there shoulda been dips in price were Bitpay instantly converting for companies like Newegg and others... Point is no dip was always very suspicious..

I'm of the mindset it was probably a combination of Kleinman and Wright.  It's not that one person couldn't have done it all.. It's only more likely although not as Poetic..  
with all the writing, checking, code, etc.. In the timeframe it was done.. There were mumbles from Satoshi in early 2008 I believe? Then the Whitepaper May 08.  And then a full beta release Jan. 09.. A lot was done in a short period of time.
It would have been good to have someone to at least bounce and proof even before the whitepaper and beta..
Wright could have still been at least in-part Satoshi.. which is funny when you think about how he's being burned at a stake here..  We all wanted it to be someone like Dorian. But it might not be.
On the other side of that he's basically (now. see below) denying Kleiman as being part Satoshi too. which is just another shady thing for CW to do.
Although.. He does say in his interview with Economist.. that he didn't do it alone. I'll assume Kleiman is the other person(s) he's referring to.
I just want to know if this was some grand scheme to get Gavin to give up the alert key (does he still have it?) or some grand scheme to push his own coin/agenda??  If he is partly Satoshi how lame.  Maybe he lost control (as some have suspected) to a substantial take of the early coins (Kleiman possesses keys).  It's all interesting and crazy.

why are people saying there was no spike today? price was hovering low 260s. 
BTCchina tweets 
"Bitcoin and like crypto currencies have been officially recognized as lawful virtual commodities" in China.. 
immediate 15-20 point jump. 3-5% jump.
Everyone realizes the tweet is another Bobby Lee fabrication at worst, and misleading at best. price stabilizes.

It did. 
like 15 points on some exchanges.  Considering a lot of people were predicting some drops after the 50k flooded the market, 15 points positive is quite a push..  I would guess if it wasn't discredited as being somewhat old news and not as sensational as the title.. it woulda went a lot higher.

Most of the positive stories for the last 12 months in the Bitcoin space have been on the acceptance of centralized parties working under the confines and conditions of government and state authorities..
Lets not pretend these mainstream Bitcoin trends make it any more decentralized and not fractionally reserved by every exchange, payment processor, and stock company.. just like banks.

You had me until "we're talking about thousands of people"...  This sub has been only in the 20k daily unique visits for about 8 months, well before the latest blocksize debate.. most users seen here for 2015 is about 4-500 at a time, unless a story transcends or crosses over to another sub and brings in some users.. seems unlikely the latest blocksize debate, alone, has scared away "thousands" from r/bitcoin.
Otherwise agreed.

This would be the equivalent of saying, because Apple Pay now exists, Paypal is less centralized.. 
You're speaking of options for individuals with Bitcoin... and those options are with centralized parties. 
The idea of Bitcoin *was* to not need or have to place trust in centralized parties.
Anytime control of money is taken from a person's wallet to a centralized third party wallet like Blockchain.info, Circle, Coinbase, and later with "shares" at Scottrade and Fidelity with SecondMarket and Gemini, those keys have become more centralized under the control of those parties, officers of those companies, and no longer the individual.  
The trust is now in those companies to provide proper checks and balances, to be running full reserves, to not hold funds, and for no one in the company to commit any fraud...
History has showed us this is highly unlikely.  see - banks.

@_date: 2015-02-10 02:50:18
joking? 
Although I agree a 51% attack is highly unlikely and a suicide of ones cash cow... you can never underestimate stupidity and greed...
if F2Pool or KNC hold a majority of the 40% of "unknown".. (it hovered near there today) highest since the ASIC centralized farm revolution of 2013..
they might be forking it soon..  and here's the best part, they would not have to ask for permission..  
What's more plausible.. that KNC who once had close to 20% was well ahead with 20nm contracts, was solo mining and mining on other pools (Eligius) .. who has built two gigantic data centers at the Node Pole, and is now working on 16nm ... only really has 5% now...?
They and China (F2Pool) have decided to keep everyone *worry free* while they monopolize the hash without anyone knowing by simply disguising their IP and block finds....
If you answer yes to the first part you're either dim or a mining company plant.

Having just read his bio.. Him having assumed responsibility for the 
UBS Rogue Trader Scandal..
I can say this guy carries very little weight in the banking world.
*ex*-ceos don't normally "carry a lot of weight" in the world in which they used to once rule, actually they carry very little weight, since they no longer hold a position which can actually change policy.  
(from the sound of it, he was given the "option" to resign.. fired.. so you know to pretend he's carrying a lot of of weight with the banks that fired him.. funny)
They can't actually enforce or do anything. they're powerless, I thought my link to the *former* US treasury sec. from last year, would help illustrate that.
Now if the *current* US Secretary had said the exact same comments.. boom.
Why? because he could actually do something with that position of power and influence.
But it was a good 2% pump. I'm sure Oswald would be proud of the bulls who got in their short squeeze.

Unknown is definitely several entities, But doesn't mean a huge % of it couldn't be one or two entities either..
The huge % jump of unknown at the same time the hash jumps.. 
You don't find that odd?
Someone (totally misquoting but it was great) in another thread a few days ago mentioned the psychological soothing there is having unknown being the majority..
Now if most of that that was GHash or KNC... You wouldn't hear the end of it...
Don't think they haven't caught on.
Do you think the Sam Cole of KNC wants to be like the Jeffrey Smith of Ghash after the public barrage he took when his miners went over 42% and then close to 50% in June 2014.? He agreed to stop accepting new members.. 
(effectively making his pool smaller)
btw my concern has little to do with a suicidal 51%, it has to do with mining centralization making the network weaker, having to put trust into centralized fail points, and people like Sam Cole who are clearly looking at the short term in fiat.. "2 Billion dollar prize in the next few years" as he put it.
@_date: 2015-02-03 09:30:14
Jumped from around 25% to 37% around the same time the Hash jumped back up. 
Listen I know people (cough plants) like to post this graph to try and demonstrate how *decentralized* mining has become... 
But KNC and Discus (now F2pool) and have long been suspected of skewing their actual block output. 
Lets not forgot the suspected addresses of KNC at Eligius, along with their own Solo Mining were once around 20% alone.. 
Do you really think they're down to only 5% now.. With the 2nd giant Data center going up at Hydro 66...?

I'll just assume everyone skimmed my post, no worries, my point was in reference to alt-coins being called a "distraction".  hence the last paragraph.


Although from experience whenever I've sent or received LTC, it's felt like being in a car-pool lane on the freeway. max 20 minutes.. compared to BTC... 
Where I've had to wait up to 2 hours before for 6 confs with Bitcoin... and 1+ hours too many times to count...  
I wouldn't really call that "exact same".. 
Again I'm not some LTC Hoarder.. But truth it truth. even with the inevitable downvotes.

No I said truth.  "there is no need to wait" and yet pretty much every Bitcoin company and individuals alike, don't agree. obviously.  
"stop worrying about confirmation times" 
I guess when someone invents a time machine where my time isn't important.. I'll stop worrying about confirmations.... 
because then I won't actually be waiting for them to complete, for me to complete a tx... person to person, on an exchange, or with a payment processor.. thanks.
6 confs were decreed by Satoshi as a means of security.. good to know it's only a nuisance of overkill in your response.  /s pull request?
That would suffice if.. Lets see.. Every major exchange... People who use Localbitcoins.  Coinbase. Circle. Etc.
didn't all have one wait 6 confs.. 
I would hardly say that's only 5% of BTC tx. 
Bitpay allows 1-2 for their business vendors, but that's at Bitpay's (a centralized company not Bitcoin) discretion and potential loss.. which i'm sure they pay insurance for.
are we saying that's 95% of BTC tx now?...
Didn't Wordpress just cancel on Bitpay for only having 2tx in months..  
Yes technically 95% of Bitcoin tx don't *need to wait* because there is no threat of double spending on most tx.. as Satoshi discussed in his vending machine post.. 
but in reality this isn't what people and companies using Bitcoin are comfortable with and what people trading or using experience.

Your point is not lost.. But there are properties to Bitcoin that wouldn't allow integration or changing.. at least not easily.. 
Lets not forget how many people would have to agree, to integrate those "successful properties".  
Just talking about changing header size causes people headaches.

My point is, referring to alts as a distraction is as equally luddite as saying Bitcoin is worthless.

Showing this helps illustrate how little bitcoin is "in demand" by someone outside of this niche market. and pretty much all movement is done in huge whale buys and sells.

buying large bulks of BTC does not necessarily cause upward pressure. 
the price dipped after both US FED seized coin auctions.  And there's another 100k going to be auctioned off..
And even still you're assuming they're hodling BTC and not selling them.. which if they were selling, it would of course cause downward pressure due to the influx of coin on the market..
