I elect [cryptobranding.com]( to do the following:
* A graphic design that has both the Yelp and "We Accept Bitcoin" graphics on a single half-letter page or similar size.
* An envelope design big enough to fit the sticker without folding and including the Yelp and Bitcoin logos in place of a return address

I cashed out my interest once a month for the 120 days.  And then cashed out my principle last week.  All went well, but will not be putting more bitcoin into my account again. Done.  It's too risky.

I would like to discuss this further with you.  Can you show me what experience you have had with the development of bitcoin-related applications?
