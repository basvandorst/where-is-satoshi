Just like how old folks screamed at you for using those brick sized Motorola cellphones back in the day because they cause ear cancer.

The last time BTC price shot up like this earlier this month, it was followed by a dip of more or less 2k USD.  I'm worried...  
Worried because I currently don't have cash on hand to buy more BTC if it dips!

I'm sure that question has been asked when BTC was 12k, 10k, 9k, 7k, and lower.  It will also be asked once BTC reaches 20k, 25k, and higher.  So...I'd say yes, do it.

Instant transfer with that Bitcoin stick eh?  Ledger Nano S and Trezor are so yesterday.

Is it weird I'm not even feeling worried?  Last month I'd be refreshing reddit for comforting words whenever BTC would dip $500 to $800 dollars.  Now I don't  even care if it dips to pre-Vegeta meme prices.  If BTC doesn't recover then oh well, it was a fun experience and lost money can be earned back.  Cheers!

I'd say around 12.5k via steady climb.  Sure we might see a surge to 15k, but based on the past few weeks any sudden surges are followed by corrections.  I'd prefer a steady climb vs. an unstable surge.

I wouldn't say anything until they question a future acquisition that you'll get when you finally spend some Bitcoin.  "Hey son where did you get that ____ ?"  "Oh, I bought some bitcoin a few years back when it was cheap and decided to use a few to buy this..."   
I mean, a good way to introduce someone to BTC is to show them something tangible you got out of it.  That instantly diminishes the chance they'd say something like "lol digital currency isn't that a bubble etc"

Are these huge sell orders all just one person, or a collective of multiple sell orders?

It will definitely create awareness, but I doubt there will be immediate impact to BTC price.  A few will probably buy right away, others will start researching into BTC and deciding when and how to get started.

Wednesday.  Monday = many people come back to work from the weekend, read and catch up on all the positive BTC news and start stocking up on BTC.  Wednesday is when many "traders" see the spike in BTC price and sell a portion of their holdings, triggering a minor correction or dip but after that brief selloff and thanks to holding powers of btc hodlers, BTC price starts recovering.  
Of course, I made that all up.

I currently use coins dot ph.  You guys should pioneer the introduction of other cryptos like Ether, Iota, etc and make yourselves THE crypto exchange to use in the PH!  Sucks how we PH people are currently limited to BTC unless we go through the hassle of sending btc to other exchanges like Bitfinex or Binance to acquire other cryptos.

Re: Bonus Question  
I think it will play out similarly to when the previous BTC crashes happened:  Price dips, people panic sell or HODL or buy the dip, then BTC  recovers and price goes back up.  See

This.  
Kicking myself for not getting into BTC back when prices were around 1k USD because I wasn't aware you can buy fractions.  Such is the price of ignorance.

People are excited because of two milestones:  9k (vegeta memes) and 10k, because... 5 digits.  If you think about it, it's just a 2k increase from 8,000 to 10,000.  People were happy but not this excited when BTC went from 5k to 7k weeks ago.  Imagine the amount of incoming posts as we celebrate incremental increases of 300 to 500 USD all the way to the prophesied 100k value. :-D

I like how all you lowbies get excited over Bitcoin rising above 8k.  Here I am, sitting high up on my 15k buy-in cloud, feeling excited for all of you :). 
*Looks up at all those sitting even higher on their 18k buy-in clouds.*  Hope you guys are okay up there!
