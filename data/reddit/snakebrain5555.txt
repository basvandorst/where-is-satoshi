Pure amateur trading logic right there. Fishing for bottoms usually results in being eaten by sharks...

Trying to pick bottoms is a great way to lose money. Or to put it another way, avoid snatching at falling knives. 
For this kind of investment, just buy it in at a price you're comfortable with and hold it for at least a year. Because bitcoin is a very immature market, you'll still see loads of wild swings for a few more years. Don't stress about that, it'll sort itself out in the long run...
Also, never invest money you're not prepared to lose every penny of. If this money is earmarked for something down the line, don't risk it.

That’s a little bit different!

‘Said to have been written down...’, but mysteriously nobody can find a copy half that old...
@_date: 2018-04-07 15:05:20
Yeah, but you can’t use a system like those to extol the benefits of weed..

It probably is old knowledge. But as for when various parts of the Herbal were first written down - who knows? Some of it is probably very ancient and some of it only a few thousand years. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 14:42:34
There are no 6000 year old writing systems, so this seems like bollocks. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 21:35:37
Well that doesn’t support anything being written down 6000 years ago..

Nah, had the chat with the guy, he explained the concept and that was that. Forgot all about it for several years. No idea what became of it. 
This was way back at the start, when they were worth next to nothing. I was into gold trading at the time and there was a bit of a crossover between gold bugs and Bitcoin early adopters, this was just some guy on a gold trading FB page. I try to see the funny side...

Many years ago a random guy on the internet made me a wallet and put 100 bitcoins in it to show me how it all worked. I thought it was pretty cool and forgot all about it. Damn. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 15:32:35
Yeah, but that’s 1000 years and several thousand miles away. And even then, the very earliest vestiges of cuneiform were beginning 5000 years ago. It was not a language at that point, more like a basic pictograph system. 
4 vertical lines and a thing like an upside down A equals 4 cows. (Guess where our letter A came from!) And that was exactly how it was being used at that point. You’d send your shepherd boy off to deliver cows to the person you’d sold them to and give him a piece of burnt clay to take with him recording how many cows he should have when he arrived. 
Any Chinese system at this point was of a similar level of sophistication, and certainly wasn’t being used to write monologues on the medicinal properties of weed...

To be fair, the guy was transparently crazy. He was ranting on about cryptocurrencies, 9/11, crazy parties in Hollywood/LA, survivalism, guns and all kinds of other random shit. He wasn't an easy guy to take seriously..
Probably living on a yacht with 6 ballerinas now, the fucker.

Why is Bitcoin inherently deflationary?
@_date: 2017-06-29 19:41:26
A closed loop system (aka a solar system)?

You're trolling, right?
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:17:44
No, and on second thoughts it's not even a closed loop system. Pesky comets..

The argument I can see is that an expansionary monetary base allows for economic growth, which is basically why we've had explosive global growth since we abandoned the gold standard. Similarly a fixed base will cause stagnation of growth because it doesn't permit the rapid expansion of credit/money supply to facilitate growth. 
We've had extended period of fixed monetary bases to compare - through much of the medieval period in Europe there was virtually no price inflation because the supply of money only increased at approximately the same rate as population/economic activity. There wasn't huge deflation, just very, very slow growth. That said, there was a small but steady quantity of silver/gold being mined which may be enough to stave off deflationary processes.

I understand what inflation and deflation are. I'm just drilling down into why Bitcoin is inherently deflationary..
