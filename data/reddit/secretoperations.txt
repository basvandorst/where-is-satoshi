Newbie at 17k and bought a few just a day before the dip here.
I slept through the dip, i would have double Downed on the investment during that time and HODL.

Ok will try tomorrow. I presume i will need an OTG cable to transfer my BTC to Ledger though?
Thank you guys! :)

Despite making a boom on TV there's still a lot of people who outright don't care about bitcoin tbh. Doesn't matter if you joined late, you HODL where others wont listen

I just got my Ledger Nano S in the mail today. I currently have my BTC in MyCelium and I know the two can work together, but as far as I know, I need an OTG cable - they don't do these anymore. How can i send my keys from MyCelium to Ledger then in this case?
Also, I know its nice to be able to see your balance and exchange to $ in MyCelium, but I suppose u cannot do the same when you have your BTC into Ledger? It's more of a store and forget kind of thing is it?
Any good resources regarding using these wallets?

Noob question : I thought bitcoins are stored on the blockchain and not on a hard drive, and that the wallets that contains our keys can be recovered if you have the seed? Unless back then they store BTC differently?

HODL FAST.

I would avoid involving money with friends altogether.

Yes and No. Its fine while theres nothing happening there, Not fine when it gets hacked or you get some exchanges that needs a certain amount of balance to do the transfer. (Looking at you BitFinex)

Maybe fiat will coexist with Crypto in the future as it is now but more widely accepted?

Some countries are pretty much stuck or have limited access to other markets

Don't worry some of us late adopters will jump at the bargain/discount.

Shhh. Some of us have been waiting for this dip to buy in ;)
