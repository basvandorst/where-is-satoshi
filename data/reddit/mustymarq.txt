This is delusional, you can’t “attack” Bitcoin by maintaining the status quo. By taking this strategy you are ceding your “ideological high ground”. 
The pro-HF side could not ask for a more perfect script to end this stalemate. Imagine, at a certain block height, Core unilaterally implements rules which are not enforced by the mining majority. That same day, a single block is solved that is fully valid according to the current ruleset but does not conform to Core’s segwit omnibus changeset… Those clinging to the segwit rules have then forked themselves off the network by attempting to implement contentious changes to Bitcoin without PoW consensus. The network hashrate falls by 28% as an altcoin is born. 
This completely turns the tables, making Core the "aggressor". Miners cannot be seen as the "evil enemy" HF’ing to bigger blocks, they simply keep mining blocks according to the status quo… and successfully resist an attempt at coercion by non-mining interests.

It would only take one miner to make a block that is invalid to segwit miners (currently 28%) but perfectly valid to the other miners. There's your chain split. Core devs picked 95% for a reason. 
Just setting a flag day and seeing who forks with you would be cleaner/safer than this.
@_date: 2017-02-04 06:17:36
Invalid is in the eye of the beholder. You think satoshi thought that his holy repo would just be rightly inherited down via github? No, it is secured by economic incentives.

Don't you get it? If the majority of miners are not enforcing segwit rules, **the block is valid to the majority of hash power**. 95% was chosen for a reason, it's to prevent you from being forked off onto a 28% rump chain. 


The "entire community" doesn't find or add blocks, they don't build the chain, miners do, and you need a majority of them to enforce your rules... or _you_ end up forked off to an alt-chain.

Incorrect. The only reason it is "backwards compatible" for non-mining nodes is because it _isn't_ backwards compatible for mining nodes.

They don't lose their block reward on the status quo side of the fork.
You know you are just using bizarre terminology to describe an attempt to change the rules of the Bitcoin protocol with a minority hash rate? IOW, forking yourself off to an altcoin? Are you unable to see that none of your favorite Core devs are advocating for this? Did you ever stop and wonder why that might be? Fear of intense hypocrisy isn't the only reason. 
If you really think miners are just a transaction ordering service, and the protocol direction is determined in the Core dev IRC room... Why not execute your fork cleanly with a switch to keccak work and a difficulty reset? This way you shed the "corrupt miners" completely and remove their ability to disrupt the minority hash rate side of the chain fork.

Name _one_ previous soft fork that changed the economics (!) of Bitcoin. One that made the per byte fee cheaper for the transactions of a new and favored implementation and data structure. 
Previous SF have all been adding neutral per byte _functionality_, and fixing bugs, a critical distinction. 
The freedom afforded by a hard fork allows you to reject any blocks over 1MB, you don't even need to change your software, just wait for the blocks to roll in. 
SW soft fork intentionally drags dissenters along, and it penalizes them by offering cheaper fees to their more submissive brethren. Not a precedent we should be setting, me thinks. 
With SF, only miners are _required_ to effect protocol changes on the Bitcoin network, dissenting full nodes have hoods pulled over their awareness of network activity to bring them along. With HF, _everyone_ can accept or reject proposed changes, no coercion.

I simply attempted to explain _why_ segwit approval is firmly [stalled]( at 25-30%, and why it is likely to stay there. 
You see newbs making breathless and concerned posts like this one, positing that the issue is “lack of awareness”… 
The reality is that maxwell wrote an email to the mailing list, that email became the “roadmap” for Bitcoin, nearly verbatim. Everything Blockstream wants is in that email, the *one thing* the miners want is left out of it. 
That he took this path knowing he would need to get 95% approval from the miners he’s sought to exclude from the decision making process could even be interpreted as a sign of delusion. It might have been comedic if it didn’t bring us such a fractured and gridlocked community.

If the intention was _not_ to employ economic favoritism towards certain transactions, Core’s segwit wouldn’t be coded the way it is. 
Also, if miners wrote custom software get around the way it was coded, making segwit tx just as expensive per byte as normal tx… the UTXO incentive realignment argument we are constantly hearing goes up in a puff of smoke.

Just to be clear, your reply didn’t refute what you quoted. 
Segwit deployment is only safe if miners overwhelmingly enforce it, hence the 95%. There would be some perverse incentives involved if it was ~51%.
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:47:39
Segregated witness was very much known to be deployable by soft fork then, and that was what was being discussed in the HK agreement, SWSF. You can’t simply change history like this. 
There was NO major outcry by dissenters when the agreement was announced, just the opposite, actually. Maxwell didn’t make his “well meaning dipshits” comments until nearly 3 months _after_ the event involving his now-CEO and cofounders took place.
I’m not saying that Core is _obligated_ to follow what is in the agreement. Just that it is something to consider if they find themselves frustrated by a flat to declining 25% approval of their proposal.
@_date: 2017-01-25 03:08:56


No, they can receive payments _from_ segwit nodes, not segwit tx's. They see that a miner has given them an anyone can spend tx, but they don't understand why.


They don't validate the most critical aspect in Bitcoin, the signatures.
Anyway, this is all very hypothetical as segwit has stalled out at less than 1/3 the hashrate it needs to activate. Miners have largely rejected your proposal and are awaiting a revised one.

Either the agreement is null and void, or it isn’t. Which is it?

You will need to gain the acceptance of miners to accomplish what you want… that means you don’t get to _dictate_ the terms, it’s a _collaborative_ process.

Bitcoin’s chain wasn’t bloated with 0 fee spam to the full 1MB for the last half-decade plus.

You prefer centralized quotas over the free market, it’s a position, but it’s not mine.

Miners' decisions will elicit a reaction from the market, which acts as a firm and direct check and balance on their power. The miner has a _very_ strong incentive to maximize the value of the network and its native token. Bitcoin's long term incentives are fundamentally broken if this is not the case.  
@_date: 2016-12-14 06:19:30
Pretty much, yeah. That’s the subtle point they are making, though. It's _not_ just viabtc and roger’s pool that are segwit-only opposed/agnostic, it is almost three quarters of the entire hashrate. 
If blocks signalling segwit were at 90%, as opposed to the current 25%, with only Haiyang and Roger opposed... it might be a different situation. 
@_date: 2017-01-29 07:33:46

What the…?
Did you even read the [agreement](


Would you be insulted or put-off if you had made an agreement with someone… an agreement where you both do something the other party wants, a compromise. Then, months later, one party says “Actually... we’re **only** doing what _I_ wanted, and _that’s_ the compromise. If you have a problem with that, you're playing politics!” 
Miners know that if they give segwit unconditionally, they will _never_ get an increase to the block size. Increasing to 2MB will be argued against because it has a 8MB attack surface with segwit. 4MB will be “impossible” because it will be a 16MB attack surface. Growing demand for transactions against the perfectly inelastic supply of block space will be used to push transactions (and fees!) to LN and other overlay networks. This isn’t politics as everyone likes to claim, it’s business, on both sides. Bitcoin’s incentives are based on people following their own self interest, and miners are following theirs.

We would have hard forked to greater throughput already if there hadn’t been an emergency [“agreement”]( in Hong Kong last year to stop it. The agreement was that segwit and a modest HF to increase the base max 1MB blocksize come as a package. Not that they happen at the same time, but that you don’t get one without the other. 
Now, Core “decision makers” have deemed that agreement _null_ ’n void and want _only_ soft fork segwit. With 1MB base block staying in place indefinitely, they are centrally planning Bitcoin’s economics to push general Bitcoin transactions to LN and other overlay networks… 
Given this sequence of events, and the incentives facing the involved parties, a majority of miners appear to be understandably reluctant to give Core everything they want on a silver platter. 
[Most] miners aren’t idiots, they will increasingly derive income via fees and keeping blocks at an arbitrarily small size to help their fee-siphoning competition just doesn’t make good business sense. While most miners could assume good faith at the time of the HK agreement, they now require promises to be made in the form of shipped code.

Highly capitalized and widely/consistently connected LN hubs reliably running on server grade hardware that connect directly to your endpoint.
It offers a sort of PoS for large/well-funded/highly connected LN nodes, where channel liquidity will offer returns in the form of LN fees. Not saying LN should be intentionally prevented, it shouldn't (and can't be), but it has implications regarding the economics of the existing system, _especially_ if it is being artificially incentivized by centrally planned production quotas.

No force involved. You are free to mine blocks on the 1MB side of the fork, or you can change the work function and excise that part of the network, with like-minded individuals. Of course there is an "evil" forking option, a "safe" hard fork, that is preferred in some circles. _That_ involves coercion, and subversion of liberty.

You've skipped almost three orders of magnitude in your extrapolation. 3.7tps to 37 to 370 to 3,700 to 37,000. Most that are in favor of a market-decided block size are also in favor of off-chain solutions competing on a level playing field. The complaint is against artificially crippling on-chain capacity in a misguided crusade to incentivize the alternative. Purely distilled, it's the argument in favor of free market capitalism against the idea that the optimum economic settings for the system can be determined by an adept group of technocratic central planners.

It took 6+ years to finally hit the 1MB ceiling, why didn't miners bloat blocks to the max with free massively replicated secure storage for all those years? 
It didn't happen before and it wouldn't happen now, for the same reason a capitalist doesn't produce an unlimited amount of product and give it away for free.

A Bitcoin with an artificially low throughput and relatively high fees is a fertile ground for the complex overlay network “solutions” your company is developing. In a sense, you’re in the enviable position of determining the characteristics of your competitor’s (on-chain Bitcoin tx) product. 
Inversely, letting Bitcoin’s native capacity and utility grow… *actively hurts* the competitiveness of your company’s [perceived] prospective products. 
The pervasiveness of this suspicion about your company would be greatly lessened if you had publicly published a business plan that indicated otherwise, offering plausible alternative revenue streams.
So far, investors (including insurance/banking giant AXA) have plowed in $76 million in return for shares in your company. You have one public product, Liquid sidechain, which has been confirmed to be indefinitely [delayed]( by your newest shareholder. These “conspiracy theories”, as you deem them, flourish, precisely because you don’t offer any _plausible_ alternative explanation of your company’s motives and interests.

It's ok to be pessimistic about dramatically altering the fundamental dynamics of a _working_ system by bolting on an entirely new system, with an entirely new set of (counter) incentives. 
Routing between a user, a Lightning hub, and a merchant is indeed not difficult. It's obviously the most efficient and reliable way to route a payment. One could add hops and obscurity artificially, but always at a cost to efficiency and reliability (read: less competitively).
Chin up though... with segwit's miner [approval]( pretty much topped out, there will be _plenty_ of time to work on adding additional layers of complexity and inefficiency to the routing algo of the hypothetical Lightning Network.

I know you want to, but you can't have it both ways. Either all nodes validating the ruleset that the miners enforce is important, or it isn't. If your "upgrade" works by blinding nodes that are unaware or disagree, they aren't important, and miners decide the rules. Soft forks hand all power to the miners. Hard forks require the acceptance of nodes, and miners. 
Of course this is all _very_ hypothetical as miners appear to be flatly rejecting segwit soft fork. Resultantly, I see the miners are following their own self interest as is the design of the system, and I agree with them. If they decide to HF to greater capacity at some point, I will join them, as our interests align. You and MP can go right ahead and solve your own 1MB blocks and stay on that chain, I won't force you to do anything you don't want to do.

If miners decided to abandon segwit post-activation, and claim witness-secured coins in the blocks they mined… Segwit-understanding miners/nodes would view their blocks as invalid and not follow their chain, while non-segwit nodes might accept them, as they know nothing of segwit’s rules. 
This is a big part of the reason that Core chose a 95% threshold, and are unwilling to lower it. There are some dangerous incentives involved with not having nearly unanimous consent and enforcement of a soft-fork by miners.

Not even close. Seriously, up your -dbcache level. Default is 100MB, or the equiv of -dbcache=100. You could add the line dbcache=8000 in your .conf file, or start with the -dbcache=&lt;n&gt; flag, without touching half of your ram. The bottleneck is not your CPU, it's the speed at which your CPU can interface with the database. 
With appropriate use of ram vs disk, a high end system and connection like yours would probably be able to sync the entire 7 year history in less than a day.

Miners don't have a problem with payment channels and LN in principle, nor with the technical benefits of segwit (malleability and quadratic verification time fixes). 
They _are_ against heavily incentivizing off-chain alternatives with an arbitrarily small limit on the miners' own services and capacity. 
After the HK agreement was unilaterally tossed in the trash, they're done with trusting empty words. They now require code and action to back those words. 
@_date: 2016-11-05 00:45:30
It took Bitcoin 7 years to finally reach the ~3.7 TPS ceiling. 300 TPS on-chain isn’t a realistic concern for today, yet it _will_ be technologically feasible in the future. 
Segwit’s fix for quadratic validation time (of optional segwit transactions only) is nice, if largely unnecessary considering the potential parallel validation of blocks. 
The soft fork deployment of economic favoritism while tricking old/opposed nodes is not so nice. The malleability and quadratic hashing fixes are a beautiful wooden horse for locking in the soft fork + MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE = 1000000 forever upgrade path.
I think LN and other overlay network ideas are brilliant, as are the devs working on them. I just oppose economically favoring them at the protocol level, at the expense of average P2P Bitcoin transactions, by devs who have a financial interest in doing so. They are good enough to compete on their own merits without centrally planned incentivization.

Feel free to stop wringing your hands. Relax. This was not unforeseen. To the contrary, actually. 


Don't be so naive to think that satoshi was unaware of the strong and direct economic incentives that underpin his "consensus machine".

I see. Applies to Core 0.13.0 and forward. 
In your experience, what is the optimum dbcache setting, if one has an abundance of ram? Is anything over 5000 pointless?
@_date: 2016-12-04 20:15:54
Not really, it's the same line they fed the miners 10 months ago. 
Now the new reddit users get to go through the same experience as the signatories to the HK agreement. 
Things change when it is contained in a Core release.

Is there an echo in the datacenter when BTCC solves a segwit block?
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:42:35
I heard f2pool will ~~vote for~~ signal support for segwit in April, maybe.

Not sure why you say "Nice try", and then immediately proceed to heartily commend the accuracy of the analogy.  :)
@_date: 2016-12-19 10:52:49
That's how it works, you can fork (rebel, or join a rebellion whenever you like). 
Statism comes in when you use the force of the state to get your way, *like you advocated up thread*. 
I'm not going to promote consensus breaking software here, nice try.
You and theymos can use whatever labels you'd like, I won't sue you. ;) 
e: If you're the one individually down-voting each of my replies in this thread, I feel sorry for you, I won't respond in kind.

the relevant time period:

Letting dramatic changes to the protocol be tested on another value-containing network instead of _only_ being tested on a value-less testnet seems prudent, TBH.
@_date: 2016-12-16 20:30:58
This is also why it is called an "evil" fork. Those who wish to break off from the mining majority and continue to use the old rules (i.e. want to keep 1MB max blocks) are actively prevented from doing so.
Edit: Luke describes a "less evil" variety of a soft-hardfork below, which seems reasonable.

I prefer Phil Potter's opinion on the benefits of network changes.

Argument by simple assertion plus schoolyard ad-hom. Do I need to tell you it wasn’t very convincing?
When you’ve had some time to dry your cheeks and are ready to present an actual argument… I’ll be here for you.

Bobby Lee, who's hashrate represents 40% of segwit's entire bloc of support, is an idiot, then? I disagree, he understands the situation better (and has more on the line) than most of the hysterical ideologues you'll find here.

Thank you Sir, may I have...

Some Core contributors have stated that they have no interest in continued work on Bitcoin if the gmaxwell [email]( is not adopted, or is amended by the market and/or miners. 
There is also the potential that the devs will “fire the miners”, as they say. They then leverage their influence over bitcoin.org, this sub, and bct to start a spinoff coin with a GPU centric PoW, and call it “Bitcoin”. It’s an undesired outcome, but approaches a certainty given enough time. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 05:58:28
[Right]( I forgot Core is a very loose agglomeration of over 100 individuals. There is no decision making hierarchy in the organization, at all. 
BTW, how’d you get rid of your “redditor for 9 days” flair?

Those pools are a small minority of the hash power that is standing between you and getting the segwit-only/LN model you desire. Resultantly, you should probably tone down the insults directed towards those that may have an opinion that differs from your own. 


Yeah, I hobby mine too. I use the waste heat to warm part of my home. The difference? I’m honest with myself and understand that my TH/s are not going to be enough to sway this thing.


Miners hold a very large amount of weight and power (see: title of the OP and the conclusion of the whitepaper). You personally might not hold much weight as a miner, but that’s simply because weight is proportional to size.


Maybe someday, but that influence remains dormant and largely irrelevant without you buying or selling in the market. I suppose you could sign a message and try to overturn the bitcoinocracy vote.

Well there's your issue. Try his sockpuppet u/MidMagic.

Care to explain why you think it becomes a certainty after a year?
Technically, it could be up to *an infinite amount of time* away.
