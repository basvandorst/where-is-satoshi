Good luck waiting on that to happen.

Well, I can't argue with that since at some point the solar system will be consumed by the sun, and if the US hegemonic financial system hasn't crumpled by then, the universe will end *some time* in the future, bringing it down at that point.  However,  as much as we'd all love to have BTC rule the world, I doubt that it will happen anytime in the next 10 years.  Or even 20.

The best way to exit vi is turn off the power and go outside.  Some people have been known to leave their computer running up to ten years because they couldn't exit vi.  But seriously, when in vi hit the ESC key a couple of times, then hit the : key, then type wq and hit ENTER to save the file and exit or q! to exit without saving.

I'm not saying they'll save *us*, I'm saying they'll do everything in their power to save *themselves*.

Never ascribe to malice that which can be easily ascribed to BITMain being complete morons.

Clearly this action is designed to prompt people to move to Bitmain's own pools.

Then, you'd quickly find out that it's a scam.  No one will give you $6000 to beta-test an app.

Actually, no.  All state is recorded on the *shared* disk.  If node 1 hangs, node 2 connects to the same disk that was previously connected to node 1, and starts running lnd.  No state is lost.  Of course, you'd need a SAN for the shared disk, hence me comment about it not being practical for home users.

I realize this is probably not practical for most end-users, but on Windows Server, you could setup a Failover Cluster using a shared disk for the bitcoin node and lightning network node software.  That way, if one node goes down, the other takes over.

CAP is the theory that you can only have 2 out of the three ideals of consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.  Consistency is provided by state being saved to the shared disk, which is admittedly a single-point-of-failure, which would seem to point at  availability in CAP as the week link, however backups can mitigate that.  Clusters can be very partition-safe by virtue of the shared disk and other quorum mechanisms such as a file server share.  Windows Failover Clustering is a highly tested and reliable solution that is fully capable of complying with database ACID ( quarantees.

Forbes is blocked for anyone using an AdBlocker.  If you are *not* using an AdBlocker, you're asking to have your coins stolen, IMHO.

It's not a real location.  There is no one living there, no electricity, and no Internet; except possibly satellite internet.   There are also no roads in the vicinity, as the ground is peat-bog.  There are mosquitoes the size of wolves too, just for fun.

Not much need for a full node then, really.
