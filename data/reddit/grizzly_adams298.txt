The FUD from the last fork didn't cause a dip.... it caused bitcoin to CRASH and lose half its value! Then, after the fork, it ballooned to 5k.  Being able to double your money is nothing to scoff at.

Investors care. It's a simple question. Is it happening or not? Funny how such a simple question is so difficult to answer. This is uncertainty, uncertainty =doubt. Doubt causes fear. Fear will cause the price to dump, hard. Just like the last fork. If you don't care about your money then i agree you shouldn't care, but i think the majority of people would like to not lose their money.

Arks' Smartbridge is far more superior than VTCs' simple, "atomic" swapping.
