Volatility out of fake news and negative publicity.  I think these are among the top that would cause bitcoin's downfall.

For some the strategy is simple, buy low sell high.  It's actually more than just that.  It's an investment with risks too much beyond one's control.

It would be hard to tell the total number but I'd like to believe basic economics is taught in college degree so assuming anyone received tertiary ed would be at least familiar with economics.

Interesting article.  Maybe half true and half not but the more important thing here is that crypto is gaining so much popularity that whether we like it or not it's something that's to stay.

Picture shows how high the risks are with bitcoin! :)

Is this even real?

The risks are always high.  That's how it is and that's how it will be.
