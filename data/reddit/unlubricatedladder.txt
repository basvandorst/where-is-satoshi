better than accepting a currency that goes down in value ever day. My average clients have no problem making payments via BTC.

If you want to be wise, take a percent of your savings and diversify the cryptos you buy.  Bitcoin is okay, but Litecoin, Monero, Dash, and Ethereum are all fine too. Just dont chase any cryptos with below 1,000,000,000 market cap. Too easy for it to be a scam.

I bill them at the end of the month for weekly maintenance and its usually somewhere between $100-$150 worth of BTC. The fees on coinbase are actually really high. My clients have my BTC address saved and make the transfer when I let them know the amount they owe me. The transfer happens really quick when they already have BTC, so most of my customers buy more BTC in advanced to have the amount ready to go when payment is due. Since I have actually gotten some complaints about the fees, I let the customer deduct the free from how much they owe me. If you want to avoid the fee, trade in other cryptos.

All I did was get an account on coinbase and had my clients do the same. They make it really easy to transfer BTC. So if a client wants to pay me, we both take our phones out, open coinbase and get it done. Also, they can just save your BTC address and send BTC whenever.

market cap of btg is large because a lot of people can’t sell theirs and dont want to move their btc in fear of losing their free air-dropped coins

The more people that NEED Bitcoin, the better. I had these customers for over 2 years, so they really didn’t want to switch gardeners over a payment method problem. Only one of my clients had not heard of BTC and the others told me they never had a reason to get involved or didn’t know how to.

This is kinda funny because EVERYONE knew tether was a scam. Now money disappears and they want to blame an “attacker”. cut me a break

Real reason is that men get obsessed with money, and men like to gamble. Women like money and gambling too, but not nearly as much.
