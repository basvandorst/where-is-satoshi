All they can do is regulate the change of crypto into USD.  The whole point is to do away with USD, and leave these regulator jerkoffs in the dust.

Geez, that is a good point. It IS impossible with Bitcoin. How do we solve that? Do we even want money that can't be inserted anally? 
@_date: 2019-03-04 19:57:59
Banks are not the problem, its the money they push that is poison. If they deal in sound money, and build financial products like ETFs on sound money, then it isn’t a problem. If they aren’t able to operate as fractional reserve inflation engines, then they aren’t a problem. If they become a problem, then all you have to do is hard fork

I think that’s exactly what I said. Their current form is the problem. They move poison counterfeit money. Bailouts are counterfeit money printing.

neither does USD

The socialist central authority will be swept away with mass adoption of crypto, and will make forced collectivism under any name - socialism, communism, democratic socialism, social democracy - an impossibility. This same crypto will make the petrodollar, and the US's rabid defense of it, completely moot. Just because one socialist goverment (the US) feuds with another more socialist government (Venezuela) doesn't make your argument any more true. Venezuela's problems began long before the US got involved. Socialists just can't intellectually face yet one more abject failure of centralization. It's pathetic.

Exactly, stupid socialists in the US keep trying to pretend US sanctions caused this crisis. Wake up. Crypto will make your collectivist orgies of theft impossible anyway, and socialism will be a purely academic talking point among the pseudo-intellectual elites hanging in free market coffee houses everywhere. Can’t wait.

This is such a complete canard. [Venezuela screwed itself]( The US had nothing to do with their downfall, even if they are stupidly trying to manage the collapse. This is just the endgame for the forced collectivism playbook.
@_date: 2019-04-14 22:00:57
Hahah if the CIA could end crypto tomorrow, they would. It terrifies them. You probably work for Barnes and Noble coffee shop

&lt;checks history book&gt;...oh look, no sanctions against Venezuela until 2017. The worst sanction we ever pulled against Venezuela was becoming the world's largest exporter of oil ourselves. Venezuela owned itself with debt and money printing, price controls, and nationalizing of major industries. just like every socialist country. The US will look like Venezuela pretty soon too, and for the same reasons. A dirty socialist lecturing me on history, how fucking rich. You will never find someone trying to contort the facts of history more than a socialist. Welcome to the dustbin of history. Crypto will bury all the useful idiots in the US and in Central America. YoU'rE a BiGoT! Give me fucking break, you unbelievable idiot. You need an update to your programming.

Hell yeah, pull that money OUT!

Shut up.

Love this guy’s passion and explanatory power. Americans don’t get it because they think their money is solid. Africans get it right away

“Facts” lol.

There is no hope for commies, don’t even try. They are infected with a memetic brain virus, that renders them useless at best and violent at worst (making them actually into Lenin’s USEFUL idiots). That is why crypto is so powerful. It will make money untaxable, and forced collectivism impossible. Then these asshats will fade into history.

You unironically posted Sam Seder? Really?

See that’s the point. I don’t have to declare anything, and they’ll only realize it when they run out of money for bullets

I bought an HTC Vive VR Rig with my magic internet money, and this is the most futuristic sentence ever. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 13:48:09
Don’t fucking care. This is government rearranging deck chairs on the titanic. Crypto will bury their stupid asses. Its so funny to me all the fighting over political power we have right now. None of it will matter when we are all ungovernable, and every socialist’s autistic screeching about greater good will be for nothing in the face of untaxable population. Crypto Anarchism is coming whether ya’ll want it or not.

Lol, fair enough! They are masters of grift
@_date: 2016-05-31 01:45:04
I actually think it has more to do with Venezuela collapsing.
@_date: 2018-12-02 14:24:34
Don’t sell, but DO spend a little. Using crypto as currency will undergird its value

i'm locked out of my account, and it has taken almost two months to make any movement on it.  A short "we're sorry its taking so long" message comes in every 3 weeks or so.  Just terrible.  I should send them a bill for all the money I've lost just waiting to be able to access my account.  Never again.
