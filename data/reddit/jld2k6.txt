Aren't the jumps just literal market manipulation at this point? Back when it made it to its peak people were showing that the graph of it's falls and declines pointed directly to rich people purposefully buying at the same time to inflate prices so they could sell for huge profit when price rose to meet the new demand

Jesus, you could have cashed out an even million if you sold at 10k.
[I think I know who may have been behind the theft of your coins](
Really though, damn that sucks!

I'm really regretting paying over $30k for a couple of pills nowadays lol. Those drug dealers must be insanely rich by now if they kept their bitcoins, Jesus.
Edit: Just remembered I had like .2 BTC left that I never spent due to the price fluctuating. I go to check Mt. gox and it's gone lol. Did they declare bankruptcy and take everyone's money? 
Edit 2: I may have been spared of days of combing meticulously through my house looking for the temporary unique username and password unsuccessfully lol. We moved and it got packed somewhere but who the hell knows where that could be

The original fake subtitles of him was when he was talking about how the ecstacy at this place sucks and then he realises it's good and it begins kicking in lol. Saw that all the way back in the early 2000's. Super old meme!
