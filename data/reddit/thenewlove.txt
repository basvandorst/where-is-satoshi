So you see it as an asset?

Oops. Forgot to mention: GBP, in UK.

I like this answer. How did you buy them without a credit card?

Planning ahead, old boy.

Apart from the no fees bit (personally, I've never experienced any exorbitant fees, but that's just me), I think you can do the rest with actual money.
Your first point is simply the same as investing in shares, or gold, or coffee, or anything else they showed Eddie Murphy in Trading Places. And in the UK, my bank account pays interest. 
The moral argument (funding large banks) is a bit of a sticky one for me. Banks are, obviously, unbelievable bastards, but they fund a hell of a lot of our national economy, even after they've needed bailing out.

If I only had one or two BTC and I wanted to cash out quickly, what's the best way of going about that? I've not enough to set myself up as a 'seller', I might just want to cash it in, you know? 
Edit: in GBP, in the UK

I live in London. Even we don't pay $9/£6 for a beer.

non economist here. If there was a crash and there was no interference...what would happen? WOuld it be simply a case of the public no longer having money, or would it be more far reaching?

edit: ~~Redditors~~ Investors who have sold their BTC: what was your biggest cash transaction and how did it go down?
