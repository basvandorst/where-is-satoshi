*His fair value analysis is so low it's laughable. The scarcity of btc is substantially higher than the ~12,000,000 in "circulation." I'm offering 0.09433 BTC (~$100 USD) bounty to anyone who will produce the Blockchain analysis to quantify addresses with no activity in the past 12 months and their corresponding balances.

That's a fair consideration. Clearly he has a head start on a more detailed report. My question is not meant to expose "problems" with people losing money. Instead it's to show that scarcity calculations of Bitcoin are imperfect, and therefore any reduction of fair value should include assumptions for dormant/out of circulation units.

To discuss valuation in terms of fiat-BTC conversion alone misses the entire "smart property" market cap. BTC is not the "currency of the Internet." Instead, it's the "Internet of all assets."

I'll wait for the OP to respond. I'm happy to pay for this information. It's useful to understand that the supply constraints are more severe than many realize, thus enforcing the idea that BofA's fair value analysis is way too low.

I just posted on another thread I would pay 0.09433 BTC for this information. What's your address? I'm happy to pay up.

Per the FinCEN guidance, Bitcoin is not an artificial currency. Bitcoin is a foreign currency.

1. Mike is welcome to try this idea out in the private market place. 2. The foundation should stay agnostic. 3. The crimes associated with BTC transactions pale in comparison to other currencies, even on a proportional basis. Which leads me to 4: this is a SOLUTION LOOKING FOR A PROBLEM.

I'm reimbursing him. Apparently they aren't cheap.  Fair deal all around.
