Do you know about better leadership in cryptocurrency currently? And please don't say ETH / ETC devs...
The majority sticks with Core...when there are lot of money involved, you can't reach 100% consensus with your leaders...Bitcoin the leadership is ok...it will never be perfect, never and nowhere, forget it

Can't be that smart when u/bdarmstrong celebrated the "victory" of ETH fork few hours after the fork...look at the mess now...they were all wrong with the hard fork...some mistake admitting would be nice from these kind of "best, brightest and most trustworthy people in the industry" because for me, they are totally reckless and we should not listen to them regarding the security and decentralization of Bitcoin network...

Well technicaly, you should already stop trying to leave any money in exchanges...i mean, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice...Anyone leaving lot of money in exchange after the MtGox is risking every second mostly out of greed to make more coins by trading...don't know how many times this will have to happen before people start to listen and follow the security advices

@_date: 2016-08-25 10:41:15
Simplifying one line of code change with contentious hard fork as a result just shows how little you know about the bitcoin as a network, decentralization and nodes...The blocksize increase wasn't accepted by majority of community, devs, miners and nodes = you didn't reach consensus for the one line of code change...Did you come with solution to resolve the issue? No...Are you crying all the time about the issue? Yes...You did completely nothing to resolve the issue, except whining as a little girl

"Many of us want to see promising solutions come to fruition, have accepted VC money" - it seems to me you want to force bitcoin development fixes and changes, asap, without taking the proper time to test it in depth, just to not let down your vc money providers...The moment we will start thinking this way - to please VC money providers - i am out of bitcoin...With lightning network, we won't need them anymore that much as we do now...and they know it so of course they will support solutions as bitcoin classic etc...Communication was bad with core, true, now is much better...Bitcoin classic supporters spread unbeliavable amount of FUD and misinformation...Even though sometimes he is a little bit arrogant, I still believe more Peter Todd than Coinbase, Uphold etc...and also one point what many people are missing - Core have short term solution to scale bitcoin, on time - their roadmap...There is, still some time before blocks will be full on average so why not to try everything to find difficult technical solutions to keep decentralization in the same level..? Coinbase and VC industry don't care about decentralization...I do...

are you in the credits of Bitcoin Core 0.12 release?
@_date: 2016-03-18 21:05:12
Yes, valid points, but why do you want to raise the blocksize right now? Average blocksize is around 70%. Core can always raise the limit to 2 MB in worst case scenario, it is one line of code...But why not to try everything to find alternative solutions before we raise the limits? There is still some time left before the blocks will have average blocksize of 1 MB
I think SegWit is exactly the type of hard coding work from Core...give them chance to find the best solution...People or most people screaming hardfork to 2MB right now don't have the proper technical knowledge to see things from all the security angels...i admit there is Gavin and Jeff and few other great devs supporting hardfork right now, but biggest prophet of the hardfork was Mike Hearn and look how he acted when it was not his way...i am glad he didn't succeed with the fork and although i was banned here before for talkinng about xt, now i see the xt as attack on bitcoin too and with classic, i am not sure what to think about it right now either

"Anyway what volunteers ? I thought most main core developers were paid these days ?"
I think there are still lot of volunteers, not paid by any company or institution, working on bitcoin core development...The anti-core fud propaganda was really huge and i am glad that Core devs are providing new optimalizations of bitcoin code very often with quality testing and reviewing...you don't have to show any gratitude, but you can't ignore the fact that core is providing much more dev work than classic and umlimited combined...i didn't agree with their PR few months ago, but i believe those guys in what they are doing much more than ETH, DAO or any other coin devs to provide us !SECURE! decentralized alternative to bank systems...

There will be lot of forks in Ethereum, since it will be exploited in the future more and more...Don't know if it is good idea to fix every theft with "hot" fix forks...From my side of view: people agreeing with the fork are in my opinion people who invested in DAO or ETH and are scared from losing their value...I think the mind can trick ourselves to totally change fundamental views, just to avoid pain...this fork is total bullshit, as DAO clearly states it is autonomous and that the code matter...The attacker just used their own feature and now people, blindly throwing lots of dollars on alpha software want their money back...I mean, this is just hypocrisy in its purest form

Since when is ETH our friend? Going through many posts and comments from ETH "investors" in their forum and /r, many claimed how bitcoin is imperfect, bitcoin is doomed, bad, how they are happy to go away from Bitcoin etc...
Why should we help someone who didn't help us and if they would had the choice do decrown Bitcoin as  coin, they would take it, no questions asked...do you think they would help us if we'd have some seg-wit bug crisis? Meh...
It is competitor, like it or not...Though i know it is not the same and cryptos aren't companies and that we all should be better than the standard financial world, i still don't see apple helping samsung or vica versa if the competitor would fuck something up...
Sorry, but you are trying to be very nice to people claiming they have build something better and to people who didn't try to help us at all...didn't see any eth dev help to fix the btc scaling solution...we have enough of our own problems

Meni you are right in many points and thank you for writing your opinion on subject, but why do you think it is arrogant approach from Gavin and Mike? The way i see it, Gavin tested his solution to 100% certainity it is safe and best current solution there now is and he wanted that people have enough time to decide...I don't think it is arrogant approach, i think it is very sane way of doing things, especially in Bitcoin...Acting of many Core devs showed their arrogance and that they have too big ego to lead our coin and our community

Well here comes the FUD...How much ETH do you own? ;¨)
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:07:57
I always believed Nick Szabo is Satoshi Nakamoto, as the research, for example here:
is quite convincing...I don't know if he did it alone, i think Wei Dai or Hal Finney or someone other helped him to code it, but it is quite obvious that Nick Szabo was one of the few geniuses who could create Bitcoin. And since he researched it almost whole life and after Bitcoin announcment he was totally quite, it is suspicious as hell...Also he was the one using double spaces and even though many people use them, not many cryptographers researching decentralized cryptocurrency...i think he was the only one using the double spaces from the all possible creators...and if you watch him on the discussion panel next to Craig Wright, it is obvious that CW would never keep it that long in secret and when Nick Szbo speaks, i have a feeling that this fella could kind of keep it in secret, as he speaks very humble and quite...so yeah, i believe Nick Szabo (also the first letters of his name, lol) is the Satoshi Nakamoto or at least i believe he created it and some one helped him coded it, that is possible too...

I think after this Roger Ver and Brian Armstrong have lost all the credibility...you are minority gentlemen...and you are whining like little girls, because Bitcoin is not what you want it to be right now...
Brian should care about his own business...didn't hear Core devs talking to him about his business...don't know where they take the arrogancy to criticize skilled cryptographers when they two didn't write any line of code to Bitcoin and Roger has no deep knowledge of bitcoin attack vendors etc. Coinbase should support it's popular coin - Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Ethereum Zero or Ethereum Cherry and stop acting like a bitch

@_date: 2016-07-01 21:52:37
Exactly, saving his business...and that is exactly the people we should not listen to about developing bitcoin...the money driven people...money driven people usually seek bigger power and more money...greed is very close to corruption and so on...we have banks for that...If Bitcoin should follow the $$$ only, it would never survive central banks and governments future attacks and would be destroyed sooner or later...you can have 10000s alts for $$$...Bitcoin is not / shouldn't be about $$$, but about freedom
B. Armstrong and his company jumped immediately to Ethereum, saying that ETH is much better than Bitcoin...when there is little bit of doubt about future of bitcoin and its development, they just go to another alts -&gt; they just look for profit in USD...Most of the Core devs are bitcoin hard coreres...loyal to 1 coin...Not many CEOs are loyal to 1 coin...and right there is the difference
