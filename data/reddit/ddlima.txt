Just did. Thank you for the heads up. I feel pretty stupid now...

How does it work? They manage to find out my password somehow?
@_date: 2014-09-24 04:20:36
I haven't, actually I didn't even know it was an option... My computer doesn't seem to be infected, it must have been something else.

What is SR? Should I be worried? Should I delete the screen shot and create a new wallet or something like that?
@_date: 2013-02-25 01:47:39
Yeah, I know, but according to our contract they have to let me know if I over use it, and if I don't change my consumption THEN the price will go up. So I guess I have the time to think about what I will do if it comes to that...

Holly crap man, my heart skipped a beat!!
@_date: 2013-02-24 22:52:01
LOL, thx:  
  
There you go

It averages around 360 Mhash/s

I rent a place and my electricity bill is fixed, so mining or not I will pay the same thing. For that I think it is hard to tell if I had a good BTC/watt ratio...

You can buy drugs on the internet?!?!  
Man, I am getting old at 26 years of age...  
Thanks for the info!

I did fall into temptation.... Lost half of my 1.6 bitcoin...  
I don't think I am very good at this...

Don't sell it, he will try to recover it and steal your coins... Also, look into recovery methods yourself. Goodluck!  
Edit: Forgot to add: That is, if you are not a troll like emesto down here.

"Like every good american"   
He is the disgrace of a whole nation and doesn't even realise it! I lol'ed

Sometimes I wonder why some people are so rude... So much anger...  
I was talking to a friend about bitcoin today and he got really angry and started yelling about how "it was just a toy for fools who wanted to loose money" or something like that... Thing is, I was just mentioning the whole mt gox fiasco, not trying to convince him in or something like that... I don't get it...
@_date: 2013-02-25 20:59:19
I see, sorry about that, it wasn't my intention to be that kind of guy...  
But hey, it is going down in popularity pretty fast, so no more worries, right?  
I will refrain from doing that again, I promise!
@_date: 2013-02-24 22:58:20
Ok, you can have one!  =)

I bought a used computer last year that came with this Radeon 5870 video card, it works fairly well, I think...  
Software-wise I use guiminer, since the others give me a headache (this is  the reason I never got any of those other crypto currencies, btw). I also use some flags that I found on some forums and they work better than no flags:  
poclbm -v -w 128 -f 1  
I have no idea what it means, but it has been doing the job!   =)
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:01:25
Where are these graphs from?
@_date: 2013-02-24 22:57:17
I wasn't aware of it being a bad thing or something like that...  
Sorry, it is just that after my accomplishment I had no one to talk about it! I am sure you have been there, feeling so proud of your virtual money!  
My wife looks at me with a very confused face every time I say 'bitcoin'...  
Again I apologize if it was inappropriate behaviour... If it counts as something, not even I expected all those upvotes! Thinking of it, now I have something else to boast about!  
Go virtual currency and internet points!

Aw I guess I am too late...   =(

If anyone has a youtube link that would be appreciated, I couldn't find it and the video isn't availabe in Canada...    =(
