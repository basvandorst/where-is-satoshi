I honestly don't believe it's a scam, yet just a very ineffective person that is playing entrepreneur tee-shirt slinger that can't fill the orders.

Two great resources to start, including the sidebar here, are; 
 &amp;  
Here are some quick answers to your questions. 
1) Difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to find a new block compared to the easiest it can ever be. 
2) The rate of new Bitcoin creation will be halved every four years until there are 21 million BTC[3]:17 - At present 25 new bitcoins are created with every new block (approximately every 10 minutes). The only way to tell how it will affect the market is time. 
To be profitable mining cryptocurrency, you have to treat it as a committed business investment and provide time to develop skill and to stay current on technology. Being a profitable miner takes dedication, skill, time, and a decent investment in equipment. 
3) Buying into bitcoin and holding them is a great step, some people day trade which is very risky as a newbie to bitcoin, much less crypto finex trading. 
Keeping your coins in an online wallet is about as safe as trusting a 3rd party with your full bank account details and pin. It's much safer to create a secure offline wallet. 
4) Again, to be profitable, you need capital to purchase or build custom rigs capable of mining coins efficiently. I try not to discourage people from mining, but it's not anything close to just setting up a machine to run 24/7. Keep current with the latest tech trends and the huge mining community here will help you decide your course of action. 
5) Pros and Cons? Either way, you're going to be spending a lot of time, money, or both to be profitable or to advance your contribution to the BTC ecosphere. 
6) Users of Coinbase can buy and sell bitcoins for US dollars at the current market rate using their United States bank account. The company also offers an online "wallet" service for storing, sending, and receiving bitcoins, merchant services that enable businesses to accept bitcoin payments online, and fee-free micropayments between Coinbase accounts. 
7) Altcoins operate essentially very similar to bitcoin, all with their own unique "flavor" in method and functionality. 
8) A block chain is a transaction database shared by all nodes participating in a system based on the Bitcoin protocol. A full copy of a currency's block chain contains every transaction ever executed in the currency. With this information, one can find out how much value belonged to each address at any point in history. 
9) You can but... others can expand on this and I hope to say it as simple as possible, with accuracy. It's possible to trade the physical file itself, but that would include transferring the public and private to another person. Disclosing your private key to another person creates a vulnerability for future thefts since the private key was made public. This discusses the wallet itself, not actual bitcoin. 
10) Cold storage (offline wallet) is very safe, yet still susceptible to physical theft, losing it, being damaged and other calamities that happen in the physical world. 
Hopefully this answers some things and points you in a good direction, I've been wondering if I should condense the mountains of info into a single infographic for consumers and business.

Well I could elaborate. 
My full time job covers my monthly expenses for my mortgage and utilities. I also freelance design and that brings in a total of 30% of my fulltime income. I put 50% of my freelance work into it since it's money I can afford to lose if sh*t hits the fan.
