Maybe bitcoin and the Blockchain can neutralize political borders. To an extent at least lol. IMO that would be really cool.

As a First Generation college student, by the time I graduate I’d love to be able to pay off all of my student loans and debt to family for supporting me along the way.

But why does Bitcoin have to be centralized around one side or the other. If you’re a left extremist and another person is a right extremist, then what is so bad about finding a common middle ground where ideas can be shared. Maybe the hype about bitcoin sparks the interest of someone to educate themselves about different ideals and the possibilities of the future regarding cryptocurrency and the Blockchain. Correct me if I’m wrong, but alienation because of someone’s ideals not matching your own doesn’t seem like a very Libertarian thing to say.... “We hold that all individuals have the right to exercise sole dominion over their own lives, and have the right to live in whatever manner they choose, so long as they do not forcibly interfere with the equal right of others to live in whatever manner they choose.” -Statement of principles/2016 Libertarian Platform

IMO Coinbase in general is a great place to begin a portfolio as it’s easy and insured, but if you’re really looking to protect the bits that you currently own, I’d definitely suggest getting an external wallet such as a Nano S or a paper wallet.
