You can look at the source code. 
Fees are checked when included in the transaction pool:

Could you prove this is true without revealing the brainwallet ? You could give the address and sign a message with the private key. I think this can be done in the satoshi client.

You should buy in small increments over a few month to minimize your short term risk. I wouldn't buy in the coming 2/3 months. It looks too much like a bubble.

If you generated the private keys on a computer with a virus you could loose them immediately, but even if you use an offline linux-live usb drive, the tool to generate the private keys could not use enough entropy. The private keys could still stay on the computer even if you delete them (undelete, swap etc...).
The paper could be physically destroyed (fire?). It could be stolen by a friend or relative taking a picture with a mobile phone.  And if you die, will your family know how to unlock the bitcoins ?

Your advice is not very helpful. Yes, the font sizes and colors could be tuned a bit, but the rest looks fine. I also think that there is no need to stop using wordpress.

Some questions about security:
 * How do you generate the private keys ? ( is there enough entropy ? And could you show us the tools? )
 * Do you keep the private keys ?

Well said. +bitcointip $1

Yes but do it right. Getting out with this amount of bitcoins is dangerous. Spend a few days working on it. I would recommend  an offline client and backups of the secret keys in a vault that only you has access to.

There is not a lot of java in there:
1.The java applet (wFidEABfB.jar) downloads the file  (don't download if you don't know what you are doing)
2.The exe is an obfuscated compiled "autoit script"
3.Source code after decompiled:
   
4.It needs a bit of deobfuscation, that could take some time.

Thanks denisbider,
I decrypted the "img9.jpg" payload (dowload the decrypted version here at your own risk:  )
It seems to be a well known trojan:
Looking at the referenced text strings, it just looks like a password stealer. (I couldn't yet decompile it, I only tried "Dede" to decomplie Delphi)

I like the idea of **₥** but I would just use **75₥**. The BTC part would be implicit if not mentioned.
