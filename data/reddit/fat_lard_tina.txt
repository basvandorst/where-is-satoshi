And we need to realize that the entire world will not stop functioning and pour all of its money into crypto. The cryptosphere will have to chisel money from existing economies/markets and those markets are not just gonna go belly up and pour into the cryptosphere. 
So much ungrounded aspirations.

Apparently you don’t work for Microsoft. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 02:48:18
Let me try to eli5 for you. 
See that ice cream truck? It’s bad for you. Horrible people there. Kidnappers and rapists. You want ice cream? Only have Microsoft’s Yellow Snow. It’s the best. Don’t listen to the ice cream trucks. This is good for you and it’s pretty darn cheap at $10/ scoop. 
Now, make me rich, bitch.

I know I was being cheeky. 
Anecdotal but every Microsoft tech related developer I’ve met actively hated Linux and the command line. They said it was the inferior tech and they didn’t want to waste their life learning it.

If my annual salary was 40 Bitcoins and my annual savings was 40 bitcoins I'd die of starvation within a week. (Maybe less). 
There is autonomous expenditure that I cannot help but pay in order to live. So your example of savings account is not a valid counter argument to the question: how does a bitcoin have value if no one is willing to spend it at all. 
Keyword: willing. Everyone want to hold for future profit. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 13:06:03
Market corrections usually follow ATH. at least in bitcoins history it has. Maybe investors jump in seeing surge, market starts correcting, investors panic and jump off. 
I recall buying at $1100 and next month it went to $250. And hovered around $500 for a reaaaaaaly long time. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:07:47
So if top percenters own a lot, and Bitcoin is the future of money, won't this create an incredibly huge income disparity? This would be a big power grab. 
Would the wealthy be that willing to give up their power?  I wonder

That's why we are getting sharding. Yes it's currently a problem. Yes people are working on it. No it's not out yet. Go eat your dinner.

Just break up 1 Bitcoin into 1000 units, still call it Bitcoin.

I'm guessing right now whatever the velocity is, it's mostly because of using it to buy Alts on exchanges. 
So Bitcoin has two problems:
1 - transactions per second is super low for mass market adoptions
2 - people mainly holding their btc so velocity is super low. 
Also  contributes to  as well. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:11:09
Why not, bro?
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:58:53
But my dude, if I lust after Bitcoin it increases demand thus increasing price. And then OP sitting on his BTC throne will only get richer. 
Fuck that. Free the crypto. Put value in coins that actually do something. Tokens are the future. Make people not want to hoard coins but actually spend them to get something they want. 
Why would I spend 5 BTC today to buy a car if down the road I can buy 5 cars with it? Keep pumping demand and BTC will have ONE purpose. Brag rights. Make it useful. All the mining. So much energy being wasted. And the greed. Good god. The greed!

LN does solve a lot of scaling and TPS issues for BTC.

Bitcoin is never getting replaced as long as the developers draw breath. Altcoins are experiments that ultimately contribute to the Mother ship. Make a quick buck then get back to BTC.

It can track “cash flow” but proving who owns address is not as easy. 
Many wallets now use different addresses for each transaction.

I thought 1 BTC = 1 Million sats. Not 100 million sats. Someone please correct me if I’m wrong.

Hindsight 20/20. 
I bought at $100 should I sell now? Lmao. 
The correct answer is: yes if I need to pay off loans or get something nice. Otherwise FUCK NO 
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:21:50
Fuck that.
Monero has a horrible wallet. Isn't as widely adopted as Bitcoin. Bitcoin has lightning network now and a plethora of segwit enabled wallets including ledger nano s. 
Also technical debt is yuuuuuuge for bitcoin.

So 
1.	It’s not as easy as you think to buy stuff using bitcoin. The adoption phase hasn’t started. People buying btc are speculating that in the future almost everyone everything will use bitcoin.  Phone bill? Btc. Grocery? Btc. Right now buyers have lots of bitcoin but hardly any sellers accepting it (compared to sellers accepting fiat). 
2.	it is being used. A lot. Where? In exchanges! You buy and sell shitcoins using what?? Bitcoin, man! By the millions!
