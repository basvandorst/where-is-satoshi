Let me know how it goes :)
@_date: 2013-05-05 14:16:58
How is it not a real issue? If I double-spend the price of the download, the first transaction going to btcfile and the second transaction sent at the same time going to myself. I'd get the download right away. Then if the second transaction gets accepted by the blockchain, I get my money back, btcfile gets nothing, the content owner gets nothing.
Am I missing something? How is this difficult to pull off for an attacker?

What specific use do you have in mind? Would each file be different from the next? Or would it just be about limiting the sale of a given file to X copies?

Yes at this point I'm leaving the trust in the hands of the seller, he/she has to be trustworthy. My API is leaving the door open for someone else to step in right now and build a marketplace with reviews etc., like you suggest, using btcfile as a backend. I prefer to focus on the simplest functionality right now. 
Also, for practical reasons, since this is a side project for now and I'm employed full time on something that has nothing to do with it, it's easier for me to focus on a service that doesn't need as much moderation, conflict resolution, human intervention as one where I would have to maintain the trustworthiness myself.
Your suggestion makes total sense, at this point I'm hoping that trustworthy sellers will appear (people who create content and already have an audience who trusts them) and that other services with marketplace/user reputation features will integrate with btcfile.

I find that a bit problematic, I wouldn't be able to cover paying the content owner in case of a double-spend. And if I don't cover it, I'd basically be allowing a loophole. If the service is even mildly successful, no doubt that badly intentioned people would put together double-spend tools to get downloads for free.
I understand your frustration of having to wait for an email, but the way I see it, without building an insurance layer on top of the bitcoin transaction the wait is just inevitable.

Should be fixed now, I've made a whitelist for d&amp;d instead. Drag &amp; drop will only show up on Windows &amp; OS X desktop on modern browsers. Everything else gets a button that triggers the OS file picker.

I think I've set it to 10GB, but I don't mind moving it even higher if someone has something massive to sell. I want anyone with a file to sell to be able to do so. We'll see, I don't expect people to try gigantic uploads right away.
As for fiat price display, maybe later :) I want to see how the hardcore crowd reacts first.

Well, you're responsible for your own actions. We provide a hosting service but we'll only police the content to the extent that our local laws forces us to.
If it's illegal to sell content that's not your creation where you live, you probably shouldn't do it. We'll comply with local laws and DMCA requests when we receive them.
I don't think that attempting to sell copyright infringed content on btcfile will be very successful, though. People who are tech savvy enough to use bitcoin right now certainly have the skills to get exactly the same content for free with torrents, etc. So why would they pay if they're not even getting genuine ownership of the content out of it?
My service is meant to appeal to content creators. Writers, bands, video game developers. Anyone with their own content to sell that want to do so very quickly and painlessly. It's not meant to become the pirate bay/megaupload with a paywall.
@_date: 2013-05-05 17:49:32
Fantastic :) You're exactly the audience I was hoping to reach with btcfile. I'll buy your book, it'll be the first sale of real content going through btcfile ;)
@_date: 2013-05-05 13:57:10
You get the download link for the content by email. Since we have to wait for confirmations on the transaction, email seems like a sensible solution. Otherwise you'd have to keep the page open for an hour or however long it takes to get 6 confirmations, not very practical.
I didn't think people would want their download page to be unguessable. They're trying to sell something after all. But maybe you're onto something, I'll see if people want to use this for completely private transactions where they only want a whitelisted list of people to buy their stuff. The settings page is an unguessable link, on the other hand, for obvious reasons.
The QR code appears once you've given your email address, which is a prerequisite for paying. If we don't have an email address, there's no way to send the download link to the buyer. Forcing people to enter their email address is a way to avoid them making the mistake of paying, forgetting to put their email address and closing the window. They'll have no way of getting what they just paid for.
I'm never going to send emails other than the download link to a buyer. Disposable email addresses like  are more than welcome if you're worried about my integrity.

OK, I'll look into that, thanks.
@_date: 2013-05-05 23:03:24
There's a simpler form, it's just a matter of targeting the right user agents and systems, hence why I ask for detailed information. Right now it's based on JS feature detection, but obviously while the Android browser supports d&amp;d, it's impractical on Android devices. Therefore I have to add corrections to the code that decides which environment sees what form, because feature detection alone isn't ideal. The more information I get about user-agents from people, the better I can make the form adapt.

I'm using AWS.
As soon as a sale is concluded, the coins are transmitted to the seller and to an off-server wallet of mine for the btcfile fee. Basically the download link and the coins are all dispatched at once, as soon as possible.
I might make a mistake here and there like anyone, but my day job is on a website with 2.5 billion monthly pageviews, I'm fairly well-versed on these security topics. Thanks for the advice, though, it's always a good reminder that one should always be as careful as possible. Tomorrow I'll spend some time double-checking my server config.

I'd like to thank everyone on r/bitcoin who provided feedback on my self.Bitcoin post a week ago, it helped shape the launch version of the service. The "no fee" offer will probably stand for a while, until the user base is large and it's time to figure out the best revenue plan (ads might be worth looking into and enough to avoid the need for a fee, we'll see!).
@_date: 2013-05-05 14:24:18
I like that idea, I'll add the ability to set the amount of confirmations.
@_date: 2013-05-05 22:44:26
Which browser &amp; browser version?
@_date: 2013-05-05 17:37:57
Good idea, I'll look into multifactor login for AWS servers.

I think the responsibility of the scamming lies with the scammers... the issue with having a reputation system is that it can be gamed, especially here with no fees involved, creating fake reviews would only cost mining fees.
I think you should only buy things with bitcoins from people you already trust. A writer you like, a band you've been following, etc. People who sell things have an online reputation already. If they don't, they probably won't sell much. I think this dynamic actually reinforces the fact that genuine content will be sold on btcfile. Because buyers are only likely to purchase content from a reputable source.

Do you know if there's any tutorial out there about how to set up the node correctly like that and how to pick well-connected nodes? You're the second person to suggest doing this and my googling didn't turn up any good instructions on the subject.
@_date: 2013-05-05 14:02:58
If I accept 0 confirmations, can't people double-spend regardless of the BTC amount?
@_date: 2013-05-05 16:35:45
Right now there's a default fee and sellers can override it to 0 if they want to be scumbag steve about it. If it's unsustainable because too many people set the fee to 0, I'll see it coming and I'll change the pricing structure accordingly.
I think letting people do what they like will actually be a interesting way to see how much they're willing to pay for that service. I plan on A/B testing different values for the default fee as well, to see if it has an effect.
Lastly, right now I'm keeping everything, but if the percentage of uploaded content that sells a single copy is very low, I might just delete large content that's been up for say a couple of years and never sold a single copy.
The way I see it, the service is currently in price discovery. Maybe letting people set what they want will work long-term, who knows!

Especially in a situation like mine, using EC2 for my servers, an attacker could just spam EC2 IP ranges with the first transaction while spamming the rest of the bitcoin network with the second transaction. 
@_date: 2013-05-08 19:51:35
I've updated the site, moved to 0 confirmations and no email. Definitely a huge improvement in the buyer experience :)
