No, KrakAPI is not an official Kraken app. We do not have an Andriod app at this time.

BCH deposits have been enabled! See the announcement with details here: 
Tier 2 verifications usually happen pretty quick—we're working 24/7 to process verifications, but we've been pretty busy the past few months and things are taking a little longer than we'd like!

If your bank supports wire transfers, you should have no trouble withdrawing. See this article: [How do I add a CAD withdrawal account? (Canada only)](

You would not lose your wire. Worst case scenario, the funds would get held while the issue is worked out, or automatically returned to your account, but in either case you would not "lose" the wire.
I believe the disclaimer you're referring to is about the *name* on the bank account matching the *name* on your Kraken account. As long as the names on both accounts are the same, you shouldn't have any problems.
If you're still concerned and want us to look at your specific account, please open a ticket at  so that we can take a closer look.

I want to clarify that Kraken has supported advanced order types (e.g., stop-loss limit orders) for some time now and we only recently temporarily suspended advanced orders to help alleviate the current strain on our platform. The suspension is temporary only. Advanced orders will return in a month or two as soon as we are better able to process them.
You can read more on our blog:
