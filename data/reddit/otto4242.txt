There is a bug in certain widely used versions of the OpenSSL library. If you happen to be using it to secure a server with SSL certificates, then it is possible for a remote attacker to get secret information, such as your private ssl keys. This could allow an attacker to steal information or pretend to be you to other clients. 
It's a big bug for anybody with servers that speak https to the public. It is also a big bug for anybody who regularly communicates with servers using https that are running these versions. This is a very large portion of the public internet.
Short version, upgrade everything that comes out with an update over the next couple weeks. If you run a server, get brand new ssl keys too, after you upgrade and reboot the servers.

Sorry, but no. You don't get the death sentence for money laundering, computer hacking, or conspiracy to traffic narcotics. And while Ulbricht may also get convicted for paying to murder somebody, the indictment doesn't allege any actual murders occurred. 
The federal death penalty actually requires that somebody be murdered, or that it be a crime against the state (espionage, treason, etc). See Kennedy v. Louisiana.

Sure. Or are you suggesting that every single person who breaks the speed limit on the freeways always receives a ticket for it?
Government's ability to enforce law is only as good as the people's willingness to obey those same laws. If a state passes laws which create negative effects for businesses in that state, and those laws are rigidly enforced, then business in that state will be affected in a negative manner. Similar businesses in other states will prosper greater because of the lack of said law. So, either people will leave the state and conduct their business elsewhere, or just ignore the law; in either case the same result occurs. The state suffers because of the bad law. Eventually (legal time is slow), the law is repealed, changed, or just simply ignored by the majority and unenforced, becoming a dead letter.
The truth is that while major centers like NY and California and such like to think that they are leading the way, the reality of the facts are that the network as a whole is leading the way, and silly regulations in one area which have negative impacts will not be picked up by all locations or have legal impact everywhere else. If some place becomes hostile to a type of business, then that business will simply leave for a more friendly climate. On an individual short-term level, this will hurt people who do business in that area, but it will have no significant impact on the global view of all of those types of businesses.

@_date: 2014-06-17 02:47:24
This is partially true, but only for certain types of jobs or people. For the general middle class, there is direct deposit, where the money goes directly to bank account.
For those with bad credit or checking history, getting even a basic checking account at a bank is not possible. In those cases, cashing a check at the bank of issue is generally free, but check cashing services also exist. Unfortunately, they are predatory and take exorbitant fees to convert checks into cash. 
A lot of this is education based, however. Totally free checking exists, for those with a clean history, but if you're living "paycheck to paycheck", then the occasional overdraw will rapidly erode that history. Leaving people with essentially no options for modern banking. It's a bit of a Catch-22.

It isn't Wikipedia's place to refute anything. It's their place to be an encyclopedia. An encyclopedia is a compendium holding a summary of information and knowledge. 
Some people have accused Bitcoin of being a Ponzi scheme. This is a fact, unarguable and with references available to highlight that fact. It is also a relevant fact in regards to Bitcoin, specifically because Bitcoin is a new form of currency that has traits unlike other currencies.
Now, we know that Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme, because we understand it. But "truth" is not "fact". Even non-true things can be there as well, as long as the statements are factual and relevant. The fact that some people think it's something that it is not should indeed be in the article, to give all the relevant information about the topic at hand.

Those pens don't actually work unless your counterfeiter is particularly stupid. All those detect is the type of paper. On normal paper, the mark will turn black because it reacts with the starch in the paper. So, all your smart counterfeiter has to do is use starch-free paper. Easy.

So many people seem to get this wrong, I don't really understand why.
Bitcoin is new, and so is the Blockchain, relatively speaking. But you won't put every transaction ever made onto the main blockchain, just like you don't put every internet protocol packet onto the whole of the internet. You localize small scale transactions into large scale bundles. You don't even have to define how this happens, because all that infrastructure already exists.
The main blockchain is the backbone, where the main transactions will occur. The main transactions won't be between you and somebody selling you a cheeseburger. They will be the sum total of all cheeseburgers sold, distilled down to relatively few entries.
See, regular people don't need to know how their money is stored. They don't know now, and they probably don't care. What they need is a way for them to pay somebody else. So, if there is a type of entity such as a payment-services-provider (PSP), and you and me are both members of it, then we can use that to settle our accounts between us, and never hit the blockchain one bit. Our balances on those providers will simply be altered. An accounting transaction.
Different PSPs will form agreements as to how to handle transactions between themselves. They will settle accounts themselves, and use Bitcoins as the underlying currency to settle the final tally. Those will go through the main blockchain, hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of transactions condensed down to perhaps a single entry.
And what is a PSP but a bank, really? The fiat money I have in a bank is not physical cash. It's numbers on a computer. When I pay with a credit card, then that's not physical cash either. When I tell my bank to pay off my credit card debt for the month, they don't send anything between them, it's a transaction happening over a network, where numbers on both ends are simply altered. This sort of thing is how almost everybody already does business now.
The reason Bitcoin matters is because of the underlying unit of currency that all these transactions take place in. If those numbers on a computer are measured in Bitcoins, and these payment-systems use the blockchain to transfer those bitcoins between each other to settle the massive numbers of accounts they hold, then it makes the currency truly uncontrolled by any one entity that can cause it to deflate, or inflate, at will. That's the point.
And if you don't want to use aggregation methods in this manner, then you don't have to do so. Your bitcoins will work just fine outside of their systems too. But yeah, you might have some delays in getting your cheeseburger.

@_date: 2013-06-10 14:58:06
Okay, I think a couple things need to be explained to you.
Bitcoins are not like paypal. They're not a payment system. They're a digital currency. 
Let me say that again, just so you fully understand it: They're a digital currency; in the exact same way that that Loonie in your pocket is a physical currency. 
So, asking why can't you buy bitcoins easily is basically the same question as asking why you can't buy US dollars or Euros easily. You're not "buying" anything, you're exchanging one currency for another. To do that sort of thing, you have to go through banks, because nobody sane is going to hand you cash-money in exchange for credit-money. If I used my credit card to transfer you 100 dollars, would you give me 90 cash dollars in return? When I can later stop that 100 dollars credit from going through?
That's why you can't buy bitcoins online easily.
Now as to your other question, why bother using bitcoins if they're harder to use? Well, there's a few reasons for that, but basically it comes down to where you place your trust. If you think your currency is stable enough for you, then you don't have a lot of reasons to use bitcoins. If, on the other hand, you notice that the price of bread, as denominated in your local currency, keeps slowly rising year after year, then you might think about switching to an alternative currency in which to store your accumulated wealth, and you might want ways to spend that alternative currency. Just a thought.

How do you get the fiat from the buyer to the seller in such a system? Answer that, and I think you solve the major problem.
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:32:42
Same problem though, it's not decentralized. Even if you have multiple "banks" as you call them holding the moneys while we trade, then that's a point of centralization.
Bitcoin allows me to send you coins without banks. We have to trust the process only, not any particular entity. The process involves the miners doing the bookkeeping, and they have incentives to do it properly and have many other miners watching them to make sure it's all done according to the same process. That's decentralization.
I can't think of any way to do that sort of thing with fiat money having to change hands.

Bitcoin is hard to purchase in the USA because our banking system is in the fucking stone ages in comparison to the rest of the world.
Before you downvote me, yes, I live here, and I'm dead serious.
Quick: What is the fastest way that you can think of to send cash from your bank account to your mother's? Assume you use different banks.
In any other country around the world, you simply go to the bank and tell them to transfer the funds. They then do so. Takes minutes. Usually free. Try doing that in the USA. They'll tell you that they have to do a wire transfer or some such thing, and it ain't free, or cheap. Or they tell you that they do it by sending the other bank the electronic equivalent of a check, which thanks to our antiquated check clearinghouse system, means the funds will be available in the other account in around 3 days, maybe. Or you pay Western Union for the privilege of sending cash, or so on and so forth.
Our banking system in the USA has *no good way* to transfer funds. It's explicitly designed to prevent just that sort of thing on a mass scale. The debit card and credit card system rose out of this, but it's primarily designed for transferring your funds to retailers, with the bankcard companies taking a cut in the form of the rates they charge retailers to use.
Now, with Bitcoin, you're not "buying" something as much as performing a currency exchange. Thus, nobody sane will take "credit" for it. In order to give you the bitcoins (which cannot be taken back once handed over), then whoever is doing it must be sure that they're getting paid on the other end. 
In other words, if I give you 1 BTC at a given rate, then I want to make damned sure that I get my dollars at that rate. The USA's banking system does not have a good way for me, as a seller of BTC, to ensure that I get my money. Card transactions can be unilaterally cancelled by the buyer. The USA's banking system relies on the equivalent of "the check is in the mail", literally. There is no sane way for you to transfer a seller US Dollars in a way that ensures that they get them, swiftly.
Don't blame BTC. You will have the exact same delay problems buying any other currency. Try to go to your bank and buy Euros, right now. Bet you it will take a few days.

If they were actually different accounts, then they would have different account numbers. This is how banking works at a somewhat fundamental level. You need to talk to your bank to find out why that happened and what they consider the difference to be.
One account number = one account. You can't do it the way you're thinking, banks (and credit unions) just don't operate that way.

Bitcoin isn't like a credit card. Bitcoin is cash.
With a credit card, you're borrowing money from somebody else, temporarily, in exchange for paying them back at a later time. If there's fraud, then you can get the credit card company to not pay for that fraud, making the merchant eat the cost (yes, somebody eats the cost of your reversals, and it generally ain't the credit card company or bank).
With cash, you have cash, in your wallet. You spend that cash, and it's gone. End of transaction. If somebody takes the cash out of your wallet when you're not looking, then you can't get it back. It's gone.
In this case, you kept your cash in a place that was not secure. Yes, yes, encryption, but "encryption" isn't some kind of magic phrase that just happens to make things secure. You have to actually practice secure computing in order to truly be secure. One slip up, install the wrong piece of software, and your data is no longer secure. This really includes everything, encrypted or not.
This isn't a Bitcoin problem. It's a general secure-computing problem. Computing is not secure-by-default, and it probably never will be, because the weakest link in secure computing is always the person actually using the computer.
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:25:12
Not really decentralized though, is it? I mean, yes, okay, the network can be made to be such, but in the end you still need to have a central body facilitating the transfer of the fiat money around between parties.
Your idea of sending in the money later only when you wish to cash out is an interesting one, but I think ultimately a problem in that I can order and hoard the system to a standstill. By simply performing all the exchanges I like, free or not, and getting all the coins in the system, and then never trading again or cashing out. You don't have my money, and technically I have all the stuff being exchanged and I ain't selling it. Gridlock. 
In order a currency exchange to operate efficiently, I think you have to pay in your currency in advance. That is, I have to put down my $100 and you have to put down yours and we have to then perform the exchanges at given values until such time as one of us then decides to convert it back, if ever. That way, I can't "buy" things in the system without ever paying for them. This seems to require a central body (or bodies collaborating) which can hold that cash and transfer it to parties who are cashing out as needed.
Remember, if I'm an untrustworthy-bastard, you still want to be able to sell to me without having to trust me directly. Thus we need a third hand which we can trust to perform the exchange. Right? Or is there another way?
@_date: 2013-03-28 17:35:39
It's a currency, not an investment.
I don't plan on selling at all. If the price goes down, then I'll use that opportunity to convert more cash to it at a better rate. 
Eventually, I'll spend it to obtain goods and services. Because that's what you use currency for.

The danger isn't necessarily in processing zero confirmation transactions, the danger seems to be in reusing those inputs, or doing other btc transactions based on them.
WordPress.com acts immediately based on zero confirmations, but if the transaction fails to confirm, they can simply remove the purchased functionality from the digital product. If you're selling something you can easily reverse, there seems to be little risk in accepting zero confirmation transactions.

The number of addresses is not unlimited, but it is very high. The exact count of possible addresses (currently) is 2^160.
For reference, if you imagined every grain of sand on the planet Earth as being an entire other planet Earth with it's own, same number, of grains of sand, and then multiplied that number of total grains of sand on all of them by 20 billion, then you'd be in the right range of possible addresses.
Or, if you prefer, if every person on the planet generated one new bitcoin address every second, they'd all have to keep this up for over
77,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years before it would end.
So, assuming you choose randomly enough, nobody else will ever have your same address. That is assuming you are capable of choosing randomly, which is a lot harder than you think. You could flip a coin 160 times, I suppose. Probably the best way.
Every once of these addresses is valid. Once you have the private key, then you can generate the public key from it. And when you tell somebody that, then they can send coins to it. You don't need to "register" it, it's a system of mathematical algorithms that define the possible keyspace.
