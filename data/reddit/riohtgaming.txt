I disagree, merchants need to see a benefit to accepting bitcoin. By spending your bitcoins you are helping merchants realize the benefits and show them that it is a payment system they should continue to support.
Spend your bitcoins, BUT, buy them back after.

I just don't see how anyone could toss away any notion of it being him based on his grammar.
There are other possibilities to take into consideration.
And yeah there are other candidates, but the bitcoin protocol isn't really that complex, it is just something that needed the right person to piece together and do it. Doesn't mean that anyone without decades of work put into attempted ecash models  wouldn't be able to do it.
@_date: 2014-04-13 18:51:21
And why is that?
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:35:55
Not exactly true, btc/doge has been dropping slowly for the past week since its halvening. I don't expect a large drop as there are many investors looking for a chance to get cheap dogecoins.

They have live betting and also a somewhat decent mobile interface. Deposits are pretty quick too (2-3 minutes for me now)
Working through your bonus is quite slow though.

Just curious, but what is the benefit of running a node?
@_date: 2014-01-03 15:52:17
Very easy, very expensive and also a limit on purchase amount.
If your in Canada try QuickBT.com to get $50/day which is a good way to spread out your purchasing.
I did the VirWoX route for my first $300 and got about 0.25 btc out of it (at btc=$950). So essentially I was paying $1200 per btc. Quite the mark up
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:37:07
One thing that I notice when reading that is he mentions "we propose". 
Seeing as the writer on the left clearly is not as comprehensive of the English language as on the right, I think it is safe to assume they are diffetent.
However, why is it hard to assume that nakamoto worked with at least one other person to publish the paper, knowing he wouldn't be able to properly articulate the difficult topics within the paper itself?
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:58:19
I think you may just be a little bit butt hurt that there isn't some mad genious behind it that you could circle jerk too.
I'm not saying this is the real nakamoto either, I'll hold my judgement until more sound evidence is presented. Until then I assume they are all theories, even yours.
@_date: 2014-12-16 03:13:51

@_date: 2014-01-09 00:24:02
I think the confusing thing is that people tend to believe that their offline wallets or paper wallets actually have any btcs on them. Those are merely the keys/access codes to use the btcs which are always present on the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-11-07 23:00:08
1btc isn't really a relevant "unit".
Yeah it sounds nice, but the community has already migrated to using bits or satoshis.
That's like saying there's only xxx trillions of dollars. That means a trillion dollars holds a lot of buying power!
@_date: 2014-01-09 00:20:44
Excellent analogy. 
I view my btcs as always being publicly stored on the internet via the blockchain, just as my car is stored publicly in my driveway/street. 
While my assets are technically stored publicly (internet/street) only I have the keys to use those assets and store them securely out of the reach of the public.
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:32:09
Well technically they could just brute force your private key. So it is still the same, just more secure
@_date: 2014-06-10 23:00:50
Awesome! sounds pretty much right on, might tweak it for personal preferences a bit but that definitely works!
I know you said you didnt want payment, but screw you! (we'll see how much this is first lol)

Hey there QuickBT! Love your service.
However, are there any plans on reducing your rates? 
I am a regular user and have gained access to the larger purchase options. However, I can't justify buying large amounts through you at such a large % markup.

In fact I would probably warn them to never go there.

Bitbook.biz user here, haven't had any problems yet and their customer service is actually pretty good. 
I accidentally sent 0.05 btc to an old account which I forgot the password too, figured there's no way they're even respond. Nope, got a response/solved within 24 hours.
Much recommend.
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:30:32
It cost me roughly $300 USD, a bit more than I had originally hoped to pay but it did help to bypass a lot of the red tape to deposit through other means.
I did look at eBay as well, glad to hear it worked out for you :)

That is assuming.. A) everyone would be willing to sell out for 5$ B) that the market would completely disregard logic of supply/demand and remain at 5$ even though one buyer is clearly trying to purchase all the bitcoin. C) that there are no more bitcoins to be mined D) That the price will ever drop down to 5$ again... Oh wait.... I swear at least one of those sounds pretty implausible/completely uninformed

I could tell you, but as that would include revealing personal information about myself while doing so, I would ask that you first send 1btc to: 13qTgE148HRC8TPPsGYHn27ucpD8JEqz7f which will allow me to take care of the lawyer fees and help you get your $$ faster!
