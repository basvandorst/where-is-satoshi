I know about trading more than you do. 
I may not know everything about blockchain, hash, hashrate, etc etc...
But when it comes to trading, monetary policy, economics or finance, I know a lot more than the usual crypto "expert".
So... according to you, you need only a tiny fraction to pay because the market price of the btc is $100k, but what if the merchant doesn't care and for him the btc price is $10k? Then I bet it wouldn't be convinenient for you to pay in btc, right?
Unless 100% of the network want to make transaction at $100k/btc, then $100k/btc is just for a minority of people, AND, in case of total liquidation there wouldn't be enough $ in circulation to redeem the total market cap.
Btc is like fiat currency on roids. Super cool to trade, but not really that useful when it gets to be used in the real world. 
Probably this problem will be solved in the future... I hope so...
But right now it's failing and very people get "it".

If you see that someone is selling the chicken at $30/lb while you could buy it at $3/lb, how many clients do you think the guy at $30/lb is going to have?
This is what is going to happen with the btc, without the mass adoption. People could trade it up wherever they want, but unless they cash it to fiat and then pay in fiat, the valuation is not representative or anything.
It's just speculation, and I have no problem about it.
But let's not pretend that bitcoin is deflationary, is immortal, or is worth like the us dollar monetary supply or like gold, because it's BS.
*for some people* it may be like that, but not for everyone.

A stock represents an ownership in a real business that makes money and releases dividend or return money to shareholders through buybacks. The shareholders can vote to deploy cash in X or Y way, to select management, etc etc.
How does bitcoin generate wealth per se? What sort of rights does the ownership of bitcoin give you?
And I'd be the idiot, lol.

Nope.... $1 is $1 everywhere, and it's accepted by anyone, by law.
The fact that BTC is at $10.500 on exchanges, doesn't mean that in the real world, every and each merchant would accept its value. You'll then have an escrow to provide liquidity and exchange the BTC for fiat to give it to the seller of the good...

My advice: let her sign a prenuptial agreement where the money you make is yours and the money she makes is hers.
Then tell her you have bitcoins in case you die...
