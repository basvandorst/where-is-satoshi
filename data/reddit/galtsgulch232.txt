Hmm. I don't believe that. Looked like emotion and projection to me. But ok, so what can you compare Bitcoin to for a fair analysis?

I'm sure she does.

I don't own a single bitcoin. Nor have I ever, or do I plan to. What wishful thinking would I have, exactly? The similarity is emotion and the human condition of repeating the same actions. Time changes, supposed fundamentals change, but emotion stays the same. As if the wheel just gets reinvented when new assets emerge. Please. This is part of the reason history repeats. Thanks for displaying that for me.
But again, I said glean what you will from the chart. You jumped to a defensive position, got emotional, assumed my motives, and want to automatically discount a comparison of an asset class that trades as a store of wealth vs. another asset that acts as a store of wealth as invalid. So who is wishful thinking again?

The “agenda”, if you can call it that, is merely to point out how reliable hostory is when it comes to bubbles and perhaps to give some newbies perspective instead of blind hope. 
Underlying fundamentals matter very little once any asset begins an exponential rise. At that point it stops trading on those fundamentals and trades almost solely on emotion. That is why bubbles follow the same patterns. That is why comparing silver, which has some practical value/use, is entirely valid as a comparison to Bitcoin. That is why “this time it will be different” is almost never true.

You realize I am not arguing for bitcoin, right? You seem to be a bit confused.

I followed the silver boom/bust closely. Bitcoin burned brighter and fell harder faster, so I had to do quite of bit of normalizing on the charts.  BTC is shown in blue, SLV in black.  Glean what you will from this comparison.

You replied before i got my comment in.

I mostly agree with that. While you are in the bust, I think it useful in determining, at least, short term price direction. Calling an exact bottom, not really. Long term? Much less useful. The trick is figuring out what long term means. Busts tend to go flat and stay flat for a proportional length of time. Which is exactly what silver is doing now.

And still, "this time will be different", was the mantra.

The new technology isn’t limited to or proprietary to bitcoin. So how would value derive from “adoption of tech”? 
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:05:54
Are you saying Bitcoin can only be analyzed in reference to Bitcoin? If not, what else can it be compared to?
