I wonder if banks could save themselves some serious dough by utilizing bitcoin for bank to bank transfers?

It's just digital cash, better isn't the right word to describe it. You wouldn't say cash is better than c.c.s, but most merchants prefer it because it's easier to deal with, and cheaper. 
Ain't nothing wrong with cash, digital or physical.

I don't think Pluto Pete thinks he broke any law or is at risk of going to jail, otherwise he wouldn't be suing to get his assets back. At best its a legal grey area, where this case may set precident as to weather or not his actions were legal. If it was as black and white as you insinuate, no sane lawyer would take the case.

And where the fuck do you get that legal to possess assets seized in a federal investigation need not be returned? The gov has already decided to sell the assets, deeming them unnecessary to the investigation, what law prevents them from being returned to their rightful owner? If anything, I believe that the government has the obligation to return items that are both legal to possess, and unnecessary to the investigation.

Yea, my friend manages a restaraunt, mostly take out. They only accepted cash and had an atm in house that charged way to much. About a month ago they started accepting credit cards, instant 20% bump in sales, and it has sustained. I have zero sympathy for businesses that bitch about credit card fees.

Take away the online part of it and you've just described a yard sale, or a flea market. And you know nobody pays taxes on that shit. And before you start with the scale of Sr making it somehow more guilty, there are flea markets that are as big (volume of sales wise) or bigger than the entire sr.

I'm generally pretty trusting of what I read, and have never really noticed shill accounts before. However the last couple days here it's been pretty apparent there's an effort to sway the conversation. 
I think it's just the sheer volume of these posts that give it away. They look like: 
Strongly worded title!
Small paragraph or meme explaining further...
Bunch of really supportive, but low effort comments with few child comments.
Just rapid fire popping up in my reddit feed all day yesterday. What made me notice was the ratio of bs posts to real posts, and the lack of diversity in the comments.

Absolutely! I don't have a problem with bitinstant, but a bit more functionality with regard to cancelling and re-directing payments that cannot be made would be soooo helpful. I've used their service every time I've bought bitcoins, and the only issue I've had with them is exchanging to BTC-e. And even then, their customer service was pretty good in resolving the problem. 
I'm not a programmer in any way, but I would love to help promote a bitcoin based payment processor. I've got some Ideas I'd like to bounce off you later if you're game .

I think setting up an okay account is the easiest way besides just transferring btc there. You still lose a percentage, but the btc price should make up for it

oh snap! I need to evangelize my tea party buddies with the gospel of bitcoin. I bet I can even speak at a meeting. Is there a good guide out there that I could base a power point on?

[local bitcoins](
Lots of people already already do this, and probably make a bit of money from it. If you can establish yourself as a reputable vendor, then you're golden. If you look at the prices, most vendors buy a bit below current exchange and sell a bit above. 
Another way to make some coin with a little more risk would be selling [btc on ebay.]( The risk is that ebay and paypal do not give a damn about the blockchain and will side with the buyer if they initiate a chargeback. A good way around this is to offer some kind of tangible good like a piece of paper with a wallet address on it that you mail certified along with the instant transfer of btc. 
One more way is "selling" cash or prepaid cards to people looking to discreetly cash out of their bitcoins on various forums and on [bitmit](
I believe bitmit uses escrow so there is even less risk there. Good luck with it, I am currently looking onto a couple of different options for businesses to start using btc.

It's really cool how responsive the bitinstant folks are here in the forum and to email requests. There service is far from perfect, but it is about the easiest to use and usually the fastest.

Well, there is always the Silk Road. Is there something of value there that consumers around the world would like, but don't have very easy access to? Sell it on Silkroad! Even if 50% of your shipments get seized, the profit margin from that region of the world's cash crop would more than make up for it. Buy in cash, sell for BTC

It seems like they respond to emails at certain times each day. I've had $1000+ transactions tied up with them for a couple of days, and emailed once asking what was going on. Something about their reserves being low, and the transaction would go through in the next couple of days. The next day I emailed asking for the money to be refunded to my MtGox account, no response for a couple of hours. So I sent another email and it was responded to immediately, as well as the first one. The deposit was made before I had a chance to read the email.
As for cash deposits to MtGox, they have NEVER messed up one of those. Always in my account before I get home.
As far as improvements, just being more informative with what is going on with transactions right on the webpage would do wonders for trust.

Depending on how much you paid for it, you could make a profit selling it on ebay, although whoever buys it will be the definition of a sucker. They are currently going for [$260 to $500](
