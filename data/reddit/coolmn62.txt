Should I go ahead and uninstall my mycelium Wallet app before I try to go put in my seed to another HD wallet

Could you please try to explain to me what importing individual keys will do? I'm trying to read up but I'm a little confused. I had to restore my phone back in March of 2017 and I had to buy a new phone here about a week ago. So when I went to put the master seed in it looks like it took me back to my account of March 2017 when I lost a little bit of money but just let it go. I'm trying to figure out where I can restore it to the other account because the last transaction that it showing on the mycelium app right now is from March 2017 and I've made several transactions and deposit since then and I am missing the money from a week ago. I know lots of people have lost a lot more money in that but the first time I only lost about 30 or $40 and just considered it a loss and that's when I put the master seed in and it showed me with a zero balance. This time I lost over $500. I had a total of 650 this time when I bought the new phone and thought maybe $500 was hacked but I'm trying to figure out maybe if it took me back to my first account when I restored my account of 2017 and that little bit of money went up

What do you mean by seed in another wallet

I had to get a new phone and kept my 12 words wrote down and thought I had my wallet backed up on HD but when I reinstalled the new app I had zero Bitcoins and the last transaction that is showing his from march2017 and that is when I had to reset my first phone and I lost a little bit of money but I just kind of ignored it. I have made several transactions and deposits since March 2017 but it's like it's recognizing my first account that I made a little bit of money in it but I lost the $500 on my new phone. I tried resetting my account several times with a master seed and it's still not showing up the $500 that I lost..Does anyone know how to explain importing private keys and could that help my bitcoins come back

You cant download 2 mycelium apps..I already tried unistall and install twice
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:04:48
So have you use the service before? I know I have the words saved right and 150 of the $650 is in my account which is weird question mark after doing a lot of reading it looks like it could have been some kind of bug and they hijacked into my account I guess. I am very upset with mycelium

So have you use that service before? I can't find any reviews on it when I Googled it. What do most people do after that just open up a new account after they move their money because I don't want those people to know my master seed.
