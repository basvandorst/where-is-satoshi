Gold and Silver Considered 'Dangerous Goods' by FedEx
Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on email Share on pinterest_share More Sharing Services 4
Amagi Metals was informed today that FedEx will no longer be shipping contents of more than $2,500 worth of precious metals to Europe and Asia. The company stated that the goods were considered 'dangerous'....but only in amounts of $2,501 and over? 
Once again regulation getting in the way of business. Just to be clear, FedEx is not a private shipping provider. While they do operate differently than the USPS in terms of funding, they are still held to the government rules and regulations when it comes to shipping. I think this calls for a new shipping company that takes the risk of working outside of these parameters!
FedEx tells us that they will only insure packages to Europe and Asia for $2,500. This poses a problem from some great customers of ours so we are diligently researching new shipping methods. If you have any leads on shipping gold and silver abroad, please let us know!
We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause to our customers. If you have any questions about buying gold and silver, we'd be happy to help, however questions regarding FedEx's shipping policy can be directed to their customer service. In the meantime we'll happily be offering shipping to our customers in Europe and Asia with orders of $2,500 or less.

First your father would need to be able to readily convert Bitcoin to USD easily as time is money. So he would have to understand this concept. That does not mean that Bitpay or Coinbase are the solutions to a business easing into Bitcoin.
Rationalize with your father and ask him what are the transaction fees right off the top with Visa or Debit cards. 2-3%? That's right off the top, right?
He needs to realize that the ease of the transaction is where he will gain 1 to 2 to even 3%. Society as a whole is better off cutting out these bastards.
I don't know if you live in a state that requires sales tax, but if you are right off the bat the taxation alone is making him at a competitive disadvantage with internet or E Commerce as you put it, so that is another topic, but you can see how the equation of taxation is making him less competitive while not helping the economy because of taxes, in fact, in this instance, taxation hurts business growth in that it makes him less competitive with online businesses that do not charge tax. Adding an internet tax is not a solution and should never be part of the equation to help brick and mortar stores be competitive with ECommerce. That being said, your father needs to look at this as a trial basis. He needs to guage new business growth with Bitcoin by one transaction at a time. He can track business being drawn in via Bitcoin by each transaction and he as a business man can ask if it were Bitcoin that drove new business, one transaction at a time, or would they have come in.
He needs to look at trying this out, as he can bail anytime he wishes. 
He has to be willing to look at brand new business development and perhaps advertising locally to drive new business, and see if he sees that incremental growth he would like to see for his new retail store.

Well, the overall strategy is like this. Say you are playing a game of poker and it dons on you that it's a rigged game. Do you sit and play? Or do you flip the table up and draw?

murbul, is this specific to the "electrum" wallet that I am not familiar with? I have a similar problem, very similar. I never lost the passphrase and the likelihood of inputting the passphrase 2x in exact same problem is highly unlikely. Esp on characters over 30 long. 
I have a friend that believes he can access by hidden files and I believe it is time to try that route, he is quite knowledgeable on Linux. The hidden files are there as we found in terminal, and that's as far as we made it. What's your take? 
Beginners bad luck as it received fine, and I kept loading wallet, but never sent anything, but was bad deal when it wouldn't send and I got error messages. But I have a hard time believing I screwed up.

I never saw payment after 3 months and some 16 hour / 12 hour days 7 days a week. I don't think they plan on paying anybody. 
Someone else try and do the business referrals and see if they are full of crap and going to use people worldwide for their gain. Test this one. 
I lost months on this one. Complete waste of time.

Unless you are talking a huge (heavy) amount, freight would be nominal. The difference between buying here in the states and in Europe would be fractional. 
I have to support the members of the BTC Buyers/Sellers Cooperative. That's my answer. Please support this member.

Im surprised Schiff accepts Bitcoin at Euro Pacific as it was my impression he wasn't big on Bitcoin, but I could be wrong.

Interesting. I just contacted a town in Mexico, or state rather, that grows coffee. I am seeking cooperative farmers and trading partners, to see if they are interested in joining the first Bitcoin Buyers/Sellers Cooperative, in hopes of establishing new business development around Bitcoin. It is in it's early stages, but good niche to get into as things will change in time. 
If you know of any that want to join the Bitcoin Buyers/Sellers Cooperative, it's free and will remain free for those that join within the first year. 
With ease of transaction and understanding and cooperation, this will change international trade. 
I am also working on establishing a complete payment methodology that offers a complete management tool from order entry, inventory control, currency adjustment, to accounting, and tax prep. 
We need to step up the Wild West.

I'm running Bitcoin Macroeconomics. Not saying it's the best, just want to make a comment. Have to monetize a site somehow, fortunately or unfortunately it comes down to referral programs and gaming sites (for me). I've never ran a website but trying to draw traffic and demographics and monetize the site are all factors for keep going. I do provide some original content and try to post relative info, but it isn't just Bitcoin anymore. Not going to limit myself to just Bitcoin. 
Like all the people that poured their heart and souls into creating Bitcoin...why should they go hungry while some rich person's kid or the elite take the ball and run with it? 
Couple of articles to look at (search it on my site) Shouid Bitcoin Be Regulated...that is the question ....and an interview with Bryce Weiner, Director of Cryptoeconomy Engineering at Blocktech, just to name a few.

I like the format and method of converting Bitcoin to any currency and into bank account. I would like to see this occur for not only Bitcoin but other cryptos. I'd like to see affiliate marketing program to help steer new business to this sort of venture and increase adoption.
