yes, but JPMorgan is cwel , they're implementing their own Ethereum (Quorum) and they have a Baldet to strut her "hacker" cwellness and occasionally speak to bankers like a rebel. ofc they're discrediting BTC and (soon) any uncontrolled crypto. They've prepared their marketing game.

I think OP was grateful for the HODL until the point of paying for the dentist. So the value he got back from hodling made paying the dentist bill oh so fucking worth it.
Would have been great to be able to pay directly in BTC, so I hope the OP suggested this to his dentist wink wink.

Right. it's been great so far because cryptocurrencies are a novelty and people that got involved were the intelligent kind (mostly). Shit might hit the fan once more and more people buy / trade / participate in scam ICOs due to ignorance. Crypto will get a bad rep and that's just the least of the worries. Wanna help? - educate those around you and denounce scams. Governments are just waiting for a pretext to shut down (at least) part of this uncontrolled movement.

Shitty question, because you wanna sound like I actually said or implied this edge case. At most, I said the crypto market's probability of crashing will not be that high if people will make good / knowledgeable choices in trading / buying etc. (shocker, right?)
btw, "intelligent" can be replaced with "open to new ideas and knowledge" if it's that triggering for you.

Also, people powered money is just another type of market that introduces some variety into the system.
