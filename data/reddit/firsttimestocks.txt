You can’t say something obviously happened and then say that something else might have happened.

Limit orders on GDAX. Free.

You can transfer between GDAX (an exchange) and Coinbase (a wallet) Personally I only use GDAX because I’m interested only in buying and selling bitcoin for profit and not in spending it. Honestly with the fees and volatility I don’t even know of a practical use for spending bitcoin as opposed to cash. I’m just here to profit off the speculation.

Relevant: Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

John McAfee is a rapist.

There should at least be enough for you there to give serious consideration to the probability that he did do it and not outright dismissing it. Watch the doc.
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:16:38
I guess you could say it is “he said she said” as with many rape accusations, but The Netflix documentary outlines a pattern of behavior that leads me to be more inclined to believe Allison Adonizio, who really has much more to lose than to gain from coming forward. And not be some fanboy because “he’s cool and on the edge and likes bitcoin so that bitch is lying”
