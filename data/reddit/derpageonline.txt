Does that mean Cryptopia is no longer a tiny exchange where people get scammed with manipulated shitcoins? Coincidentally, with registrations closed, i have this account on their site i might be interested in selling :)

only 5000 people signing this? Goes to show how few people are really involved at this point in time. Lots of room for growth.

It would help people understand bitcoins aren't traded as whole units.

why is this man spying on some kid using an ATM, and why does he then tell the kid his money is now gone?
Bet he stole the kids private key too, because "it's empty anyway"
what a creep, literally roger ver tier embezzlement.

No. When i saw bittrex trying to charge me 0.001 bitcoin as transaction fee, i simply traded to a different coin before moving my money.
anyone paying outrageous fees deserves it for being lazy.

I would not trust this chart if it wasn't written in Crayon, with a nigh on empty bottle of rum next to it.
My personal flow chart:
Do you think you should have sold yesterday? -&gt; Yes -&gt; It's too late now HODL

When kids of the future learn about this, they're going to be really happy pizza has become much less of a luxury item and status symbol since.

I wouldnt really call it strong hands.
I just wake up, see BTC down 2.5k and go "welp, too late to sell, now just sit it out"
then i wake up 2 days later and BTC is down 5k and again i go "welp, too late to sell, now just sit it out"
I'm very calm about my "investment" because i mined just about all of it and loved (actually still love) the experience of learning all these new things and possibly taking a tiny chunk of the world out of big banks hands. Down 40%? Meh, who cares!

Bankers thought Bitcoin would never survive the upcoming Bitcoin Futures. Thought Bitcoin was at their mercy.
Jokes on them. Time to show them some REAL volatility.

Treated myself to oatmeal breakfast and a spent 80cents on lunch at work to celebrate how good Bitcoin is going lately. Gotta buy more bitcoin. every. day.

Making Bolivars a benchmark for bitcoin performance really smells like we're about to hit capitulation phase.

people who can't rtfm are already failing at fiat money. Failing at cryptocurrency is par for the course and there's nothing you can do to change that.

Lots of banks are cooperating in creating blockchain like technology for the benefits in transaction speed. Unlike Bitcoin, the knowledge about whats going on would be a closely guarded secret. Good luck getting a block explorer for that lol.

it's just JP Morgan attempting to self-fulfill their 5k prophecy by selling a large position right on time.

BOI if only we had some sort of technology to enable a transfer of funds without relying on arcane and secretive rituals that may only be conducted 9-5 between monday and friday and take a minimum of 20 hours, presumably of animal sacrifices and guttural chanting.

Maybe the ports that exchange bitcoin for their fiat, but what are they going to do about other exchanges?
Demand that a bank statement be attached to every transfer on the block chain? ... now that i think about it, i can actually totally see governments trying to do that, and other silly things.

Puts people at ease if they have somebody to sue when their account gets compromised.
If you lose or share your wallet, you only have yourself to blame. 
... not to mention a lot of people simply are not capable of doing it. Are you aware how many old folks still walk *into* banks to get money from an actual person because they never learned to use the ATMs?

Be a reasonable hobby investor. Take the proven approach. Panic now and sell everything, rebuy at next all time high.
