The New York Department of Financail Services exists since 2011.  New York State Banking Department and New York State Insurance Department unify in a single agency, and Ben Lawsky becomes the first Superintendent.
see wikipedia  
To the matter at hand.  Proposed regulations on "virtual currency businesses" provide citations for statutory authority.  I haven't looked into the wording of the Financial Services Law, yet I make this post now because some of the contents of the proposed regulations appear questionable as a matter of common sense.
On what basis does a State regulator purport to have such authority that he may require business entities to retain "earnings and profits" only in government bonds, money markets and similar instruments?  I don't see how such a draconian restriction can abide within the spirit of the Financial Services Law, and it may well violate the letter of that law.  It may even violate the U.S. Constitution's restraint of trade clause.
Such egregious overreach brings into question the legitimacy of this entire proposition. The matter may require judicial attention.
If we presume that Benjamin Lawsky acts within the ambit of his Department as delineated under the Financial Services Law in letter and spirit, we abdicate our responsibility.  The NYDFS works for us; not the other way around; we bear responsibility for keeping vigil over this bureaucracy and policing it to prevent abuses.
I encourage readers to research the law.  And if you can find the text of the Financial Services Law online, pleas link to it.
(b) Each Licensee shall be permitted to invest its retained earnings and profits in only the following high-quality, investment-grade permissible investments with maturities of up to one year and denominated in United States dollars:
 (1) certificates of deposit issued by financial institutions that are regulated by a United States federal or state regulatory agency;
 (2) money market funds;
 (3) state or municipal bonds;
 (4) United States government securities; or
 (5) United States government agency securities.
Statutory Authority: Financial Services Law, sections 102, 202, 301, and 302

This comes first --
Scroll down to FIS.
Read the sections cited in the text of the proposed regulations.
Discuss the proposed regulations in the context of the Financial Services Law, letter and spirit.

Petty and domineering. You can take a hike.

Uh, I meant for this comment to be appended to the thread on "how to create and use an offline-only wallet" here:

Coinbase listed two buys and three sells on Dec 6 and 7, for 12 btc each and all at the same price, then they started a lot of confusing transactions meant to correct the mistakes, with the result that now I have 24 btc less than I had on Dec 5, and no indication that they are going to pay me for those coins that are gone from my account.  I had 104 btc, now I have 80. I called it deletion, you would be doing me a favor if you could tell me the correct word for it.

Can you say, "ad hominem"?
