Most of it is just control of humans by an exclusive group of humans (government.) Some government institutions, like marriage, were actually founded in racism and oppression.
Cryptocurrencies threaten the control that government has over other humans.

India.. perhaps the greatest innovator of creating new scams over the internet.

I wouldn't advise putting more than 10% of your investment money into cryptocurrencies.  With that being said, I'm surprised to see crypto behind bonds.  Government bonds give squat returns for 10 years and you get taxed on the earnings later.  IMO they are the worst return rate.

The big money Dems will never let him win.  They don't even let him speak at the debates, lol.

I agree in that perspective.  I was just referring to where somebody would put money when beginning that long-term investment strategy.  Throwing your money into a generic S&amp;P conglomerate stock like SPY would be a much better ROI than federal bonds (although, the risk is indeed higher, but still not bad for a multi-decade plan).

Good.  Wealth redistribution and more taxes is a bad idea.

I haven't been in this sub in a long time.  You people are like peaking a microscope into 2017.

With most people gravitating towards more accurate web sources, local news hedged their losses and geared their products towards the lowest common denominators that still watch local news. They have to make money- you can’t really blame them.

The welfare state, the military industrial complex, farm subsidies, foreign “aid”, etc.

What do you call someone advocating for UBI (redistribution of private wealth by government force) and a highly increased government control in society?

Agreed. I think we have 6 more months of bear (with an obvious bump upwards or two in between). I think we will begin to recover in 2019. The pattern will be slow like the post-Mt Gox era.

Artificial inflation in this country is driven by the world bank (Federal Reserve) that actively looks to decrease the spending power of your dollar. Removal of the gold standard by Nixon ensured that they could continue this practice without interference.
USD is a (more trustable, because of its overall world adoption) shitcoin. But it’s still a world bank shitcoin.

I think we will hit the bottom in one year as well.
