The type of chip/processor manufacture has nothing to do with decentralisation.    Decentralisation is about distribution of hash power across the number of unrelated parties, it is irrelevant who the chip manufacture of the hash power is.

I have been involved with payments in the adult industry for over a decade and recurring billing is not the reason.  It is simply a matter of Bitcoin being to hard for the customers to get, it is so much easier to pull your credit card out of your wallet and sign up right away.
Webmasters don't have any reason to push for it as any legitimate site has a very low rate of charge backs and gets good rates in merchant processing so the cost differential is not attractive versus the hassle of supporting something that only ~5% of your customer base will use.

What are you worried about, you follow a main stream religion which fits exactly to your statement!

Actually Luke-Jr came clean in a post here on reddit where he said he has a slow internet connection, 1.5Mbps upstream if I recall correctly.   Hence it is obvious he is opposed to any increase as it means he would then be excluded from running a full node himself as he has a crap internet connection.   But seriously why can't he run a $5 VPS on a 100Mbps+ connection?

Wladimir is actually sitting on the fence about this, saying he doesn't want to be in the position of having to choose sides.   Although he is Lead maintainer and technically capable, unfortunately he lacks the leadership required for the position.

256k TPS is small time. Watch this space if you want to see 10million TPS onchain!

The idea of being your own bank is not relevant to your argument as with an SPV wallet your still your own bank since you hold the private keys.   The difference between an Non and SPV wallet is if your storing the Ledger data or not and that doesn't effect the idea of being your own bank.

The context of this thread is concerning decentralisation issues with the raising of the block size, not about the the diversification of chip/processor manufactures.  The thread owners point is a block size increase would have less of an impact on centralisation than ASICs did.
In the beginning even with 5-10 ASIC designs less people could obtain these due to the restricted supply and specialisation of the chipsets compared to the 2 (CPU) or 1 GPU suppliers where due to the mass availability of those chipsets anyone could go down to their local computer shop and buy them.

You mean the 2-3 week supply delay with the latest top end GPU's at the time, when other lower/medium GPUs were readily available.  Compared to the widely available websites that offered "pre-ordering" of ASIC that had product shipment dates months away and when those initial dates rolled around the products did not ship until months of delays there after.

Luke-jr's point about centralization is not valid, we already have centralisation in the manner he suggests with 1MB blocks.   
5 Pools already control around 73% of the hashing power.

Title is misleading as this does not indicate bankruptcy of Tibanne.   Its a common tactic in law to apply for bankruptcy of a company in court when it owes you money to try and get them to pay.
The next move is for Tibanne to pay it back under a payment plan, a small amount over "x" years.
