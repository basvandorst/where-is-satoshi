Electricity isn't invented. It was discovered. There's no reason it couldn't have been discovered and lost again on smaller scales throughout history. It's not like they wouldn't have seen lightning.

As for your point being solidified that's a good thing. Most people would say thank you and probably apologise after realising they've been rude to someone who was only correcting them to support their point... not you though, you've actually managed to admit being wrong and find a way to be even ruder lol. 
Re-read my first comment to you and you'll see the only thing that was disputed was the suggestion that Moore's law doesn't affect bitcoin. That was NONSENSE.
I went on to reinforce your point by talking about why performance wouldn't increase linearly because of microarchitectures and even directly messaged you to diffuse your anger.
Hell my last sentence of my first reply is "miners need chips capable of breaking Moore's law". It's not my fault you're a broken person who would rather reply with anger than read what is written. It's not my job to reach inside you and claw out the unhappiness that made you argue with me.
You have serious issues. 
Ps. I've made no counter-arguments... as I've **refused to argue** with you. 
I have merely stated you were **wrong** about Moore's law, 
laughed at your rebuttals, 
provided the evidence of you being about wrong Moore's law,
And finally told you to fuck yourself when you started to make ad hominem attacks at me for correct stating the law. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 04:06:28
Go fuck yourself.
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:18:52
This isn't a good example either. There were hundreds of search engines before google too.
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:30:47


LOOOOOOOOOL I cant even be annoyed, watching you double down in your own ignorance is incredible.
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:43:47
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL 
(Wow im annoyed already) 
but seriously go and fuck yourself you self righteous arsehole. You were wrong and now you're moving the goalposts to me being annoying because you can't admit it.
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:17:49
Well that's just not true. Moore's law directly effects bitcoin. 
Moore’s Law states that the number of transistors doubles approximately every two years. 
Performance obviously scales accordingly, but this does not mean that performance increases at a linear rate, as chip designers can optimise microarchitectures without piling on more transistors, hence yielding more performance from a the same number of transistors and chip area.
The main issue is in heat, especially when using overclocked asics. 
Another problem for bitcoin miners is the  overinvestment. 
Demand, (caused by ever rising difficulty,) is increasing faster than new development. Ideally miners would need chips capable of breaking Moore’s Law (highly doubt it would be cost effective) and then some. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:00:36
Ah yes the old "Reddit edit". You got there eventually.
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:32:36
Would love to see how much bitcoin would be worth with no miners. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:29:43
In your opinion why does anyone mine?
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:46:44
//Guess what happens when value increases? Miners start mining again! 
Imagine that? I thought they would just buy btc at dollar value like you said in your previous posts.
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:58:49
What would you recommend for someone getting into mining?
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:28:59




If you really insist... 
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:12:32
Your issue obviously arises from your assumptions. 
Moore's law isn't about performance. It's about the amount of transistors on a chip. Yes this can affect performance but so can overclocking etc.
How can you argue against it without knowing what it is? Lol
Ps. What would you like an example of? Be specific and I will provide.
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:35:41
Where did I say that sorry? 
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:23:23






What is 'Moore's Law'
Moore's law refers to an observation made by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965. He noticed that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits had doubled every year since their invention.
Moore's law predicts that this trend will continue into the foreseeable future. Although the pace has slowed, the number of transistors per square inch has since doubled approximately every 18 months. This is used as the current definition of Moore's law.

Next time just admit you made an assumption and it was wrong. Simple.

You're being a huge dick for no reason. OP was factual in his title and is informing the masses. Chill.
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:32:37
You're being obtuse. 
You can't say that miner's have 50% price increases within seconds of selling out and then say mining is something people do for fun, 
Why does anyone spend money on mining? Wouldn't they use their start up capital to buy coins?
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:12:59
the cost of electricity has actually gone down whilst the value of bitcoin in the long term has grown exponentially thus leading to a situation where I would've profited massively from mining and I'm using this experience to inform others.
Take some time to ask yourself why you didn't ask what happens if the cost of electricity goes down a little??? 
You can reflect on the answer yourself but I imagine it's probably just natural biases at work. Some of us can see the things we want and some of us can only see the things we think will stop us from getting them.
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:52:24
never said the amounts used were the same. Focus.
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:11:43
I made no reference to power consumption in my post. You may want to reread it slowly without your biases.
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:59:08
how did you buy bitcoin without spending on electricity? Are you going to minus the cost of the device you used to buy your bitcoin from your second formula? of course not because it wouldn't fit your agenda. 
You use electricity to buy bitcoin in the same way you use electricity to mine it. You also use electricity to buy, sell, send or receive bitcoin. Whether or not you count the amounts spent whilst doing this is another story.
All you're doing is refusing to admit your electricity and exchange fees exist when you buy bitcoin. Which is fine I guess, but just not really helpful to the point being made. 
Everyone is missing the point.
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:27:45
Msn 
 
That's 7 off of the top of my head. I'm sure it would be child's play to google 3 more.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:45:22
It's not an argument. It's a fact of life. You cannot buy bitcoin without using electricity.
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:41:02
The 5 btc I mined in 2013 cost me around $50 in electric and I thought that negated the worth as it would've cost $60/70 to buy. Today those mined coins would be worth circa $25k. I could've been mining all that time instead of rationalising ways that I would've lost money.
Just food for thought. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:58:51
Again... made no reference to consumption. Only referring to the glaring omissions in one side of the math.
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:08:12
It's not hard to understand. I'm just pointing out that you can't predict when costs or value will change. 
Like I said in my original post in this thread:
Just for context... back in 2013 when I first had bitcoin people would give the same advice. "Don't mine it's going to be negated by cost of electricity" but they never had the foresight to realise how much the bitcoin would be worth in the future
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:37:19
Would love to see you pay for bitcoin without using electricity 
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:56:36
I'm not confused. I run two businesses. There are an estimated 100,000 miners in the world. Many of them own successful businesses too. Take your ad hominem attack elsewhere it's boring.
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:50:05
You cannot calculate how much bitcoin is worth in the future. Therefore you cannot conclude that the cost of electricity today will negate gain tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:27:11
Loved it so much I bought this shirt lol

@_date: 2017-10-25 15:34:57
That's what I thought too before I got downvoted to oblivion for daring to notice I would've profited from it loool
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:21:14
Read further back... I only mention missing the point because it's what happened. 
Everyone thinks the point I'm making is that one thing is more profitable than another when what I'm really saying (if anyone bothered to read the original post) is the metrics in the math people use are biased.
When people told me that the mining was unprofitable in 2013 they were correct. However they couldn't predict price increases, didn't include electric or device or exchange fees when buying/selling  etc .
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:25:39
You guys have all missed the point. 
The money can buy bitcoin once or it can mine bitcoin continuously, which simultaneously gains in value.
