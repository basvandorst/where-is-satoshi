if the price of BCH and BTC will be at certain equilibrium we wouldn't see miners switching all the time, there will be a stable hash rate for both chains. But only one could survive with lower hash rate, guess which one? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:35:59
If it didn't have long term viability, it could die until August 8. Halving might not come in December. Here is an assumption, what if BTC is dead, then hash rate and diff. adj will stabilize and everything else will be normal for BCH as it was for BTC (so halving will come much later then). Yes, there is a risk for BCH, but currently I see the risk only for BTC, long waited SW will take months until it will be used widely, if it ever will be used widely. LN creation and insfrustructure creation might take years. Fee is already at ATH (8$), mempool is going to hit ATH soon. So what is long term viability for BTC if you can't transfer coins without paying big fees and waiting confirmations for days? If there are two companies, one has already working mechanism, the second has only promises, which one would investors choose? Yes, the only issue of BCH is small market infrustructure, but this can be settled much easier (might take months) than settlement of SW and LN infrastructure (might take years).

price is the major thing, the crucial question is if segwit and LN really works, if it is not going to work, then price will favor BCH, which will be the basis for equilibrium. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:02:18
This time it is different, there is BCH, the only coin competing with BTC for the hash rate, any major crash of BTC this time might cause death of BTC. If you own the coin but can't transfer it nowhere (because the hash rate is 10-20%) its value is 0. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:29:54
in the longer run it will stabilize, certain equilibrium will be found and it will not shoot like it shoots now
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:58:58
but according to the mainstream price had to be at 5000$ after SW, it is not exactly because SW appeared to be a longer path until all infrastructure is created and is widely used. It is too short time period to tell about prices now, BTC retarget is expected in 3 weeks instead of 2, it means that fees issue will be here for a long time for new and new ATH (currently 8$), so this will affect BTC price in the long run for sure. BTC was designed as peer to peer simple way of transacting without any middlemen, but it appears to be only for rich. You cannot transact now for small amounts, then why would people shall use it? "Digital gold" is an illusion thing, why would I need the gold I cannot send when I want to send? It is the crucial thing for any financial instrument, to be able to transact at any given time without the lag (waiting for confirmations for days and paying very high fees)

this is what people say when they don't have arguments :)) just troll, lol
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:06:05
all you care about is just price. Competition is good, whatever it is. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:03:48
ok, can you show any transaction with LN on Litecoin? 
How do you think, when SW/LN will actually work and will be widely used at Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:23:47
it was exactly my point, that no one can predict, but this particular post is an attempt to predict without a major assumption: that BTC price might crash and in this case the whole scenario is going vise versa till the death of BTC (cause it is the first time there is coin which competes with BTC on the same POW, until Core makes the hard fork to change it). By the way, does it mean that the more years your are on reddit the smarter you are ? ))) Very strange logic, please read my first comment again, I am not telling I know what will happen, but adding an assumption which wasn't included in the post. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:55:52
not  true, two miners who mine BCH from the very beginning still didn't spend mined BCH: 
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:07:09
you are right, they will sell it, but there is no need to sell everything, BCH price is already 300% up from the first days (200$), and 100% up from when it was 300$, this particular miner won a lot during this three weeks period, this is also a big incentive for any miner, if you can double your investments in a month. Didn't all people here telling that BCH will cost 0 till August 8? This didn't happen because of the particular miners above had a strong idea of what might happen next. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:39:45
Cmon guys, don't speak like governments who say that certain other country is taking their cake. Rule of the game is very easy, if Segwit and LN really works (as promised) Bitcoin will survive, if it doesn't work it might die. The only issue of BTC is timing, there is already Bitcoin Cash which has fast tx and low fees and it can take most of BTC's hash rate very soon. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:34:03
There is one assumption missing in this scenario, the crash of BTC price, people panicly trying to sell BTC but they just can't send it to the exchanges because of high mempool desite of ATH fees. 
BCH may crash several times but it is enough for BCH to win one time (finally). BTC may rise several times but it is enough for BTC to crash only one time to inevitably die. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:11:40
BCH potential halving is perhaps in December, but BTC slow death is already here, after all the hype around SW/LN people start to realize it needs at least one year to settle everything, but mempool is growing and fee is ATH again and again. SW2 is coming in November. Can't you see that BCH halving is not an issue in comparison to what BTC have now. BTC halving did not affect the price (despite of rise). Big investors will not care about halving if they see how BTC is stuck and BCH is effective. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:54:43
Are you serious? This illusion of "digital gold" is a big mistake, you impose to ppl what we have to think about BTC (and it is not), in the white paper there is not such term as "digital gold", it is peer to peer decentralised system, peer to peer is not millionier to millionier. I am just user and it is reasonable to see that BTC could already cost 10000$ if it solved the issue of scalability much earlier (and didn't lost the market share). The power of USD (although it is nothing but paper) is that you can buy anything for this, why shall I need a coin I can't use? Listen, store of value idea is a total mess, BTC can't become mainstreem until it solves the issue. Litecoin activated SW three months ago, and it is not massive yet and LN is also under question (of real usage). Ppl want very simple system, they don't want to wait, don't want to rewrite the code, check nontested services, they want an immidiate solution, which is already here with BCH (low fee and fast transactions). They don't care how will it work, they want it to work. Another illusion is that miners will become stronger, in general yes, but number of miners will grow significantly, and in 1-2 year Chinise miners will not have this share, it is obvious, if something works well and stable and mass adoption is there, more companies will invest in mining and issue of centralization will be solved significantly. The current idea of "digital gold" is making miners centralization and monopoly system, cause it means there will be no mass adoption and less incentives for investors to join the Coin which is dying (losing market share)
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:06:04
That is the point, all you say is wait, wait when SW will activate, wait until everyone will use SW, wait until LN will work. Although there is already a working and easy alternative and no reason to wait, just use it. Bitcoin in current status is no longer peer to peer chain, you cannot buy the coffee with these fees anymore. There is an illusion created to see it as "digital gold", the only issue is that you can sell your gold CFD or real gold at any point, but what if you can't sell your BTC just because you can't transfer it to the exchange? If it just stuck in the mempool for days, while the market is crashing? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:49:26
it is already almost "owned" by blockstream
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:57:50
you are right that ppl don't care, but it is true only for small speculators with about 10,000$ investments. Bigger investors do care, they understand everything, they know that if it is not going to work it is not going to become massive, means no reason to invest into BTC but rather choose less complicated coin with better system of consensus and better tech. This is already what is going on. SW/LN illusion was the last hope for multimillionier investment companies, now they will see that there is nothing except brandname. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:47:45
Is there any proof of wide usage of SW and LN on the Litecoin?
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:20:59
there is a proof, it happened when in one block 40,000 tx were cleared up (and all cost pennies). Do not tell about other blockchains, cause BCH is the only one which competes for the same hash rate (POW). 
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:05:00
What if segwit and LN will not work or wouldn't bring low fees and fast transactions (as promised)? That would create a real issue for the whole crypto world. At the same time we have BCH with already fast and low fee transactions. 
All you care about is just a price, once you see BTC is not up after segwit you are sad and blame BCH and miners. 
IF diff. adj. of BCH is an issue for BTC, why not to make a hard fork and change pow of BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-26 03:47:29
as I said before it is still long time to wait until the halving will happen. The current issue is on the BTC side and it is growing everyday, now one can tell for sure what will happen in a month but you are waiting for halving in several months. If the trend will stay the same, by the time halving will happen, BTC might stuck with 1mln nonconfirmed transactions. It is a real issue and I don't see any short term solution for this. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:53:35
here is the proof that miners believe in BCH, here is the address of the "unknown" miner which mined BCH from the beginning (despite of much lower profitability of BCH), so that BCH didn't die on the very early days. So this miner didn't spend/sell any coin yet (worth 6mln $). 
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:18:12
ok, only time can show who is right, let's return to this in a month.

I guess whole this BCC thing comes from logic to create fear and decrease the price of BTC till August 1 and buy cheap BTC before it goes to the moon.
Otherwise they can fork BTC (if they want) any time, there is no need to wait August 1.
