The concern with attempted murder besides trauma, is the possibility that a death could have occurred.
If you don't disincentivize this then death occurs more often since there is no penalty for attempting to kill someone.

lol. the irony.
Bitcoin was CPU mined and the client started mining by default 9 years ago.
It would be very hard to not have some bitcoin after playing around with the client if you used it in the first 6 months of release.

Miners do not decide on mining algorithm changes. Nodes choose which chain to select as the valid one. This is the very nature of a hard fork.
In fact, there are bitcoin hard forks that have changed the algorithm, "Bitcoin Gold" is one.

Regardless of intent, if you don't penalize putting someone in a dangerous situation then people will more frequently be put in danger. Therefore damage will occur more often.

By that logic firing a rifle at you and missing is also a "victimless crime".

Actually you misread what I wrote.
I am saying that joinmarket gives 6 anonymity set for the same cost as 1 anonymity set in Wasabi. 
However if you want larger anonymity set in joinmarket, then the cost per anonymity set grows.
Joinmarket is MUCH cheaper than Wasabi if you are willing to have a smaller anonymity set than 50.
@_date: 2018-11-26 12:49:55
I have been using both clients for some time now. Wasabi is 20x more expensive for anonymity set of 50 versus an anonymity set of 6-10 in joinmarket.
There are tradeoffs here. If your amounts are very large, then this cost difference matters.
@_date: 2018-11-30 15:11:41
[flyp.me]( has 3.5% spread. Too expensive.

Binance has a 2 BTC/day limit. You're part of a multi hundred billion dollar crypto industry now, think bigger.

Wasabi costs 0.15% per round.
Significantly more expensive than joinmarket, if you are willing to accept a slightly smaller anonymity set.
@_date: 2018-11-06 02:01:55
Irrelevant. My point is that Wasabi is more expensive than joinmarket.
@_date: 2018-11-04 04:42:16
Wasabi costs 0.15% per transaction (0.003% \* 50 anonymity set), which goes to the wallet developer.
Joinmarket if used correctly can give you 6 anonymity set in a single \~1 BTC transaction for about 0.003% (around the cost of only 1 anonymity set in Wasabi). Joinmarket however is also very hard to use compared to Wasabi, and if using Joinmarket defaults will be more expensive than Wasabi for a 50 anonymity set.
While Wasabi is much cheaper and better than everything out there for its purpose in most ways, it is still expensive for mass consumption.  
I wish at least that Wasabi offered a way to do large transactions at a lower cost.

This is not how this meme works. You didn't even get the meme text right.  
How is the government going to take you seriously if you aren't even using the right meme to tell them what to do!

You published an article about joinmarket fees without having good data about joinmarket fees, based only on your misinterpretation of what I said directly to you in a reddit comment.
I said JM is 10x cheaper than Wasabi. I did not say that a single JM transaction is 10x cheaper than a single Wasabi transaction. 
A single JM transaction is anywhere from 20-200x cheaper than a single Wasabi transaction. Which in total is up to 10x cheaper than Wasabi.
Even if JM is the SAME cost as wasabi for the same anonymity set, this is still an error in Wasabi's fee model, since JM is overpriced due to design flaws.

Makers benefit from anonymity increasing when takers pay them, so it makes sense for JM makers to be willing to mix for near zero fee. 
This is also why my maker bot charges a fee that is very close to zero.
The advantage to takers is simply a benefit of not having to wait as long to complete a mix, and to be able to send a payment of their choice of size when they wish (so every transaction that you ever do can be a coinjoin).
Joinmarket is my primary wallet for this reason, I don't use it to mix to a secondary wallet.
@_date: 2018-07-30 14:23:42
So are you going to just cry and say sorry all day about how hard open source development is?
The point is that the fees you have selected for Wasabi are 10x higher than joinmarket so your project will be forked into one with lower fees. Wasabi will not be used nearly as much as it would have been with better fee selection on your part.
@_date: 2018-07-30 14:25:03


Neither did I. The fee is absurd and I think he is killing his own project.
@_date: 2018-07-30 21:57:45
The total fee to ALL makers for a mix with 6 makers for sending an amount in the range of 0.1 to 10 BTC is on average slightly less than 0.01%. 
It is possible to have a lower fee than this by modifying the fee selection code slightly to choose randomly from only the top cheapest makers. 
Also, at the moment you can do this with close to 1 sat/byte miner fees. 
My sample size is hundreds of sends over the past several months.
It's true that Wasabi has some potential anonymity set advantages (and also some other disadvantages). That doesn't justify/necessitate a 0.3% fee.
@_date: 2018-07-30 22:07:57
Apologies that you replied to a deleted comment. I was avoiding an edit mark.
Your article is filled with misinformation.
Try actually *using* joinmarket.
No one is confused about how much money they are paying to joinmarket, as joinmarket shows you the ***TOTAL*** fee (across all makers in your transaction) that you pay for each transaction.
This total fee is for 20 JM sends of 5 makers each (a potential anonymity set of 100) is less than 0.2%, and can be less than 0.1% depending on the amounts you are sending and whether you are willing to wait for cheaper makers to be available, and whether you are willing to re-use cheap makers (and wait days/weeks for them to have new coins added to their wallets from other joins).
Even that fee is probably higher than needed, due to flaws in JM's design. Wasabi has even fewer excuses for such a high fee.
@_date: 2018-07-30 23:37:15


JM is much cheaper.
Perhaps the disconnect is that you are talking about mixing 0.1 BTC amounts (which have a ~1000 satoshi mining fee in a 6 user (5 maker) JM transaction), and I am talking about mixing 10 BTC amounts, which also have a 1000 satoshi mining fee with 5 makers.
I just did a test in JM right now, sending 5 BTC with 6 makers (7 anonymity set). The total fee is ~1500 satoshi for mining and ~27000 satoshi for maker fees, total of 28500 satoshis fee to send 500 million satoshis. 
This is a 0.0057% total fee for this transaction.
If miner fees were significantly higher or if I mixed a much smaller amount then your argument starts to make more sense.
But my argument is that since the WW design is better (all users are makers and takers), the fee should be lower than JM.
Mixing 100 BTC with 0.1 BTC at a time with WW would take how long? 1 year? and cost $25000 in fees?. And since the fees are so high, you will not attract that level of volume easily.
