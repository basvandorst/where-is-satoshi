did it work?

In Niger, Burundi, Liberia, and others that $50k is 50x the average yearly income. That's the equivalent of the median american family with an income of $63k/yr stumbling on $3.1 million. Absolutely life-changing.

The comment you initially replied to mentioned "the majority of the world."

First of all, I'm sorry that you're sick. That must suck. I battled cancer as a kid, and I know it can feel scary &amp; lonely at times. I hope you enjoy all the days that you have to the fullest extent that you can.
Its not in the philosophical style of Bitcoin, but the American/European legal system has dealt with this problem for hundreds of years fairly successfully. Set up a trust. A trust is a fiduciary relationship between a grantor, a trustee and a beneficiary. Get your legal trustee to disperse your trust on a time-based schedule. Pick a reputable firm, give them an envelop with your storage method of choice, and give your beneficiaries instructions on how to sue them in the event that they do not disperse. A breach of contract can be even more lucrative than a trust just dispersing.

Need a way to recover if one person becomes estranged or dies.

OP did not make an accusation, he asked a normal question that a non-technical person might ask.


This part is nonsense. Basically, you've asserted "I trust group x to never read my keys because they will never read my keys." Your rationale is what you are trusting the Electrum team to do, not a reason to put trust in the group. A reason may be that you audited their code, or you know somebody who will vouch for their credibility.

You can cancel &amp; increase your fee if you want, it would give miners the incentive to include it in a coming block, but you're probably better off just waiting. around ~20k unconfirmed transactions right now

Weird definition of money. Nitpicky, but its probably more accurate to say that money is whatever the most liquid, albeit scarce assets are in a given society, not "generally accepted as a means of payment." For example ramen packs are money during intra-prison exchange while a deposit in a BoA account wouldn't be helpful. It's contextual. 
In the context of the internet, where you're taking your quiz, Bitcoin is DEFINITELY money.

Online poker is still profitable if you're good, play 35 hands at once, and have the starting capital

I like to buy some every week on or before 10pm on Friday. If there's a particularly low price on Tuesday however, I'll buy on Tuesday. Similarly, if the price is low all week, I'll buy more that week. For example, I bought quite a bit when we went to $7400 last week.
Don't try to be too scientific or too conservative about it, but looking at the price once every day isn't that hard to do. When I buy, I imagine the "regular price of BTC" right now is $10k, anything below that is a "sale price."

I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted. Using Bitcoin as a medium of exchange is in the whitepaper. 
It is also likely that increasing the usage of Bitcoin to purchase things will reduce the truly terrible Gini Coefficient of the BTC system. I know lots of smart people hesitant to buy BTC because they're worried the distribution is so unequal, BTC functionally becomes a pyramid scheme to mint the world's first trillionaire.
