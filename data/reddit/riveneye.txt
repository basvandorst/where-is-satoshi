Coinjar.io is an Australian exchange (though not the one OP is talking about).

When I posted that comment, I was under the assumption that Jim's was a single store, and not a chain. How wrong I was.
According to the coinkite website though, there are only 4 merchants in Australia using coinkite.

In curious how this will work for Uber. One of their big selling points is that the payment is transparent; you get in, you get dropped off, and the correct fare is charged to your credit card. In the bitcoin world, all transactions are initiated by the customer, which brings us back to how a regular taxi works (ie. You can't leave the taxi until you pay).
I suppose still forcing a user to have a credit card on their account to be used as a backup if bitcoin isn't used, or some sort of pre-filled wallet tied to your account might work though.

The guy running the store said it was his first time accepting bitcoin too. I did a little bit of research on the POS device he was using (coinkite) and it turns out he is 1 of only 4 merchants in the country (Australia) to use them.

Best case scenario: they accept bitcoin and you walk home with delicious jerky.
Worst case scenario: They don't accept bitcoin, you pay with cash and you walk away with delicious jerky.
Either way you walk home with delicious jerky. Seems like an easy decision to me.

Hmm, interesting. May I ask what the exact definition of an exchange is then? Considering they exchange my AUD for BTC, I thought they qualified, but I'm now guessing that it needs to implement some sort of system where you can try to buy and sell at any price (assuming another user is willing to take you up on your offer)?
