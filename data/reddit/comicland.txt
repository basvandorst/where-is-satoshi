Was it a physical, in-bank wire transfer or was it an electronic wire transfer done through online banking?

People are just angry. Erik is a great, sincere, moral, and ambitious gentleman. I've had the privilege of knowing him, and although his post wasn't ideal, it was undoubtedly with good intention. He doesn't just defende bitcoin for his own security, he genuinely believes in it. And so do I.

Regulation? It isn't about regulation, it's straight theft. Theft is still illegal in a free market.
@_date: 2014-10-11 22:58:20
Kind of. I understand the sentiment and don't necessarily disagree, but breaking the law in the course of upholding the law erodes the fabric of justice. It really is a kangaroo justice systrm here in the US. They make it more apparent everyday.

Do you have bitcoin work for me in Colombia or something? I'm thinking either Panama, Argentina or Chile.

You didn't answer my question.
It matters. All anyone would need to access his online bank account and perform a wire transfer was his login info and either email or access to his cell phone text records. There's at least some reasonable doubt in my mind that Ross executed the wire transfer himself if it was done through online banking.
In-bank wire transfers are more difficult to frame. Banks record. There would likely be video evidence. The teller would be a potential witness. His physical signature would be present on the transfer document. With enough evidence, I'd be able to make a better judgment whether or not I felt he was responsible for actually sending the transfer.
I support Ross and feel he should most likely be free, and I'm not entirely convinced he had any intention to hire a hit. I'm a libertarian. Government is evil. I'm not going to just dismiss the information, though and immediately jump on the "he didn't do anything wrong" bandwagon. If he didn't have solid evidence of guilt and identity for the alleged conspirators intending to release damning information on SR vendors, and did in fact hire a hit, then he may have very will been the initiator of aggression and deserves punishment.

I was one of the many intelligent people who knew better than to use mtgox. It isn't my problem to solve. I feel the appropriate course of action is, right now, to wait for more information, and then develop a game plan when we know what the hell is actually going on. All this.speculation isn't helping, but I understand why people are doing it.

And who else would? The government has a monopoly on enforceable arbitration, not to mention it is an international dispute. No matter how much I'd love to live in a libertarian society, let's not delude ourselves into thinking we can resolve this as if this was one. I don't advocate government regulation at all whatsoever for anything, but this is theft and it should be handled as such.

Why would he possibly journal that stuff? It was planted. Don't be ridiculous.
@_date: 2015-05-20 20:13:29
No, you would latch on to the government's story no matter the details emerged.
Go look at the journal entries. The original posts are in depth and seem at least somewhat authentic. Then 2013 and on they're all basic information, lacking any personality, and their entire purpose seems to be to make him appear culpable.
And whose to say these law enforcement people weren't aware of events on the Silk Road before this journals "discovery?" For all we know, the journal could have contained very basic notes, and they added incriminating details later, namely the murder for hire stuff.
I don't know about you, but I don't take the government's word at face value.
I'd like to see the "date modified" tags for these files. I'd like to see evidence they weren't tampered with. I'd like to see evidence they were authentic in any way. I'm not just going to accept this "We found these incriminating notes written on his laptop. They're totally legit, trust us. We're the government."

International fees for foreign debit/credit cards make it pretty costly and risky. Many merchants won't do it. 
Many pizza places also require the customer show the card of payment upon delivery. My dad ordered Papa Johns for me once during summer break in highschool. They took the pizza back because I didn't have the payment card on hand. 
May be BS, but I wouldn't be surprised if legit.

I have no idea what has caused the drop in Bitcoin purchases. Public sentiment may have shifted from considering Bitcoin a currency to considering it an investment commodity.
@_date: 2016-09-10 18:23:54
Maybe. I feel like there was more media hype in 2013 and 2014 than in 2015, though.
@_date: 2015-04-01 15:11:25
Was the transfer done electronically through online banking, or was it done at a physical bank location (paper)?
If it was done online, it stands to reason another person could have accessed his online bank account and sent the transfer. If it was done at a physical location there should be video of him at the bank at the time the transfer was initiated, or at the very least bank employees who witnessed Ross Ulbricht placing the transfer. They'd also have Ross Ulbricht's signature on the necessary documents required to send paper wire transfers.
I don't know what to make of this ordeal.
@_date: 2015-04-01 15:01:39
It's their responsibility to prove he didn't. This new information brings the validity of all this prosecution's evidence into question. Personally, I was convinced he was most likely guilty before this. Now I have reasonable doubt, especially when it comes to the alleged hit.
