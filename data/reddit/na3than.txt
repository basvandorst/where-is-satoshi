They weren't free before the change, and they're not free after. Read the announcement.

The Coinbase Pro API reference ( says `type` is an optional parameter, with the default being `limit`, so it looks like your orders are going in as limit orders (which allow you to specify `price`). As for `post_only` ... "The post-only flag indicates that the order should only make liquidity. If any part of the order results in taking liquidity, the order will be rejected and no part of it will execute."

Now you're starting to understand the promise of cryptocurrencies.

You "own" it in the sense that you trust Robinhood to track the quantity of coins that you have title to, but your coins are commingled with others in an omnibus wallet. 
Robinhood Crypto User Agreement, section 9: "Custody. Cryptocurrencies that I purchase shall be stored and held by RHC in one or more omnibus cryptocurrency wallets for the benefit of RHC customers." (
Since the wallet in which "your coins" are being held isn't *your* wallet, it's reasonable to argue they're not *your* coins.

Coinbase =/= Coinbase Pro. Coinbase's fees are *significantly* higher than Coinbase Pro's. 
Also, 0.15% is Coinbase Pro's fee for maker (limit) orders; the fee for taker (market) orders--which I assume you'd use for dollar cost averaging--is 0.25%. (Assuming we're talking about orders under $100k. Fees are even lower for higher value orders.)
