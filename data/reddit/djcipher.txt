To be clear, bitfinex uses Impurva Incapsula, and BitGo uses CloudFlare.  So there would actually be 4 possible players involved in a compromise.  (Although makes a good point, the MitMs were probably not involved in this case).
In any case, it's still foolish for consumers to use a bitcoin service that is MitMd by design.

Also note that coinbase uses CloudFlare and is therefore MitMd by design.

BitGo is inherently insecure. It has a MitM by design, with all traffic shared with CloudFlare.

bitgo.com is insecure, MitMd by design.  All traffic is shared with CloudFlare.

Breadwallet is not on f-droid.org.  Why should we trust it?
(edit) Looks like the source is available:
They just chose the repository poorly.

Cloudflare takes the decentralized web, and centralizes it under one corporate power that controls the worlds largest walled-garden.  A very large portion of the web that was once freely open to all is now controlled and monitored by one central authority who decides for everyone who can see what web content.  This does serious damage to net neutrality, and has immediate serious consequences:
* Cloudflare has a policy to block all Tor users by default.  It's a crude, reckless and unsophisticated (but cheap) way to create the illusion of security.  Collateral damage is high.  Privacy takes a global hit because Cloudflare has decided what best suits their business, to the detriment of everyone else.
* The damage to anonymity helps spy orgs conduct illegal surveillance.
* CloudFlare is a man-in-the-middle who sees all traffic including tunneled HTTPS traffic (and thus passwords!).
* As Cloudflare performs a DoS attack on Tor users, they obviously do not inform web owners.  Web owners are usually unaware that legitimate patrons are being blocked from accessing their site.  These businesses are all damaged so that one business can profit.
* Cloudflare shields criminal webmasters by hiding their IP address from the public.  A website involved with crime often has other criminal websites on the same IP, but users who try to protect themselves cannot block the IP address of the malicious site.
* Cloudflare makes heavy use of CAPTCHAs.  CAPTCHAs put humans to work for machines, when it is machines who should be working for humans.
* Cloudflare is potentially injecting javascript spyware into the traffic of their patrons to collect data (this is how cloudflare pays their bills).  See  for more details.

OP- Update please. Did you get your money?

Actually it matters which bitcoin rate is used, because that's what the supplier receives.  See my reply to BitcoinFuturist.
I think I need a quotation service that will *average* EUR/BTC every ~20 min, taking the past ~30-60 min or so of realtime data into the average.  Then the client and supplier can contractually agree to use quotes from that service.  When Alice tries to verify Bob's payment, it's a simple matter of checking the historic average that came just before the timestamp of the transaction.  Averaging would add stability and verifiability to the otherwise haphazard process.

Concur.  GNU Social /could/ be better than twitter.  Post a msg on GNU Social, then use twitter only to link to GNU Social.  That's how to get the ball rolling.
One thing that makes twitter better: APIs.  An Irssi plugin enables Twitter access without being chained to a mouse and gui browser w/javascript.  GNU Social needs to get on the ball and do the same.

I have no specific recommendations ATM.

Thanks for the reference, but that site blocks Tor.  I'm only considering rate quoting websites that are open to all.

I appreciate the link but none of the listed brokers are usable (for me). Here's what I've gathered from that list so far:
* **FXChoice**: website secure, but they refuse disposable email addresses.
* **1broker**: website insecure (MitM confirmed, all web traffic shared)
* **simplefx**: website insecure (MitM confirmed, all web traffic shared)
* **fxopen**: website insecure (MitM confirmed, all web traffic shared)
* **TradersWay**: website secure, but they assume you have a mobile number and force you to disclose it.  They also force entry of country, DoB, how you heard of them, etc.  They don't realize that one of the reasons to favor bitcoin over banks is to avoid this kind of intrusive interrogation.
* **xCFD**: website secure¹. BTC can only be deposited but not withdrawn.  When an account is first created, they say "make a deposit in the next 30 minutes for a 100% bonus".  The bonus can be used for trading obviously, but it cannot be withdrawn.  E.g. deposit $200 and get a $200 bonus.  If you make trades using the $400, and end up with $700, you can withdraw $500.  If you lose the bonus money in trades, you aren't liable for it.  Seems too good to be true.
(1) bitcoin deposits are immediately converted to USD through gocoin.com.  Gocoin.com is insecure (MitMd) if you go there directly, but xCFD apparently has a secure backdoor that seems to avoid the MitM.
* **796**: website insecure. They use Impurva Incapsula for their security, which is much better than CloudFlare, but still MitMd by design. They don't seem too intrusive with data collection.
   * Poor technical competency:
      * They e-mail codes in the clear to validate new accounts and also for each login.  These e-mails often don't go through.
      * Their e-mail is malformed (when it arrives).  They send a multipart alternative MIME message but then the plaintext part is so polluted with CSS and HTML garbage that the message is unreadable in standards-conforming mail clients.
      * Website has ergonomic issues too. If it is switched in English mode, the whole first page is blank; every page needs to be scrolled down by one screen full to reach content.
   * Someone had trouble [cashing out](
* **whaleclub**: website secure.  Verification e-mail mechanism broken.
* **uphold**: website insecure (MitM confirmed, all web traffic shared)
* **First Global Credit**: website insecure (MitM confirmed, all web traffic shared)

Coinbase blocks Tor and uses CloudFlare.  Each of those reasons are good enough for me to stay away.  I would never financially sponsor a site that feeds CloudFlare.  Is that the politics you're talking about?

That sounds like a restatement of the problem.  Indeed that's what's needed, but what are you suggesting exactly?  Suppose the supplier (Alice) submits an invoice for €20k, and 30 day deadline to pay in btc.  The client (Bob) must pay "the correct amount", which is derived how?  BTC fluctuates wildly, and at any given moment a dozen different exchanges are quoting different prices, which changes a few times per second.  And worse, not all exchanges publish their historical data.
Suppose the Bob sends 30.0 btc on July 15 at 2:29pm local time (to close the 20k invoice), and it takes the transaction 13 min to get onto the blockchain.  On August 7th Alice verifies payment, which has a timestamp of 2:42pm.  Alice calls Bob.  Alice says "where did you get the rate from?"
Bob says "I looked on bitcoinfever.com".
There are a number of problems here:
 * bitcoinfever.com may not publish historic rates
 * bitcoinfever.com may block Alice's IP
 * the rate would have changed inside of the 13 min transaction time, and the transaction time is unknown.
 * Bob might look at rate quotes of 12 different sources, and pick the rate that favors him.
 * Even if Bob gets Alice on the phone while executing the transaction (so they both have to be engaged in the transfer at the same time), they might not agree on a rate.

Not all websites are insecure and MitM'd.  See this post:
It would be risky to trust any website running on CloudFlare with bitcoin transactions.

shapeshift.io is insecure.  It is MitM'd by design.  Any customer who uses your website is sharing all their traffic with a third party.
Wouldn't touch your website with a barge pole.

In this scenario, the product/service has already been delivered.  Imagine a restaurant saying that to someone who finished dining - might not end well for the restaurant.

CloudFlare enables them to outsource DDoS protection.  In short, they've taken the short-sighted stance that their business continuity more important than whether customers fall victim to disclosure attacks or theft.  If a customer's money goes missing, 1broker can point the finger to CloudFlare.  So this also gives 1broker plausible deniability if a disgruntled insider were to steal customers money.
I must point out that there are other ways a website can outsource DDoS protection without all the compromises inherent in using CloudFlare. CloudFlare is gratis.  It injects ads into the stream and also makes money from data collection, so cheap services looking to save a buck will choose them at the expense of user security.

The website for 1broker.com is insecure and cannot be trusted with money transactions.  It's MitM'd by design, and all data is shared with a 3rd party.
