It's funny that you should post this, buddie.
Considering that two months ago you posted this in specifically about Josh Garza, GAWMiners, and BTC.com.

I guess you would prefer we not talk about the scam part of this though?

Seriously? Another GAW shill?!?! 
Wake up and get out already.

Nowhere on that website is there any information connecting them to GAW.

I didn't think it mattered.  Does it matter?

This was taken directly from the PayBase TOS.  I feel really bad for people who signed up.

During the cloud mining phase, before Paycoin existed, they sold "hashlets" that supposedly mined on specific pools.  You paid different amount of USD or BTC to get a "Wafflehash" or a "Cleverhash" hashlet.  
Pool owners have confirmed that at no point did GAW mine any blocks from them.  There have been requests for proof of mining hardware that have never fully been answered.  
GAW miners started as a small ASIC reseller then turned into a fake cloud mining service and is currently attempting to overthrow BTC as the main cryptocurrency.
Josh Garza, CEO of GAW, has stated in an article with Coindesk that he does not believe BTC is a viable currency.  He also purchased BTC.com and it currently redirects to his Paybase site.
I understand that people are confused and probably annoyed by the flood of posts because it seems like it came out of nowhere.  
GAW has been screwing over its customers for a very long time now, so there are a lot of pissed off people.  
The number of pissed off people has only increased due to the heavy censorship and shadowbanning on their personal forums called Hashtalk.
All of this matters because every person who is using or has used products or services from this company have also used Bitcoin. 
In some cases, this can even be their first experience with any cryptocurrency.
 Allowing more people to fall victim to his scams is only going to further damage the Bitcoin image.
This information needs to be made public to prevent further victims.  R/Bitcoin is the best place to post this information because his company heavily used/uses BTC and GAW no longer maintains a strong presence on Reddit because they can't control the content on Reddit compared to their forums.
