It is my choice what I do with the bitcoin I control. While the vast majority is kept long term, I do spend some of it on retail transactions from time to time. I don't want the bitcoin network to be artificially crippled by blocksize limits, making zero conf useless, etc.. If the damage reaches a point where I can no longer conveniently use bitcoin for small retail or other transactions, that is the point that I get rid of all my bitcoins.

It's easy to forget in this sub, but bitcoin is still a super tiny very fringe payment system / currency that only the well-versed in modern IT and various other enthusiasts really know much about. This core group is supported in numbers by a larger group of people who have heard of it but don't understand it at all. With few knowing about it and fewer actually using it, it's not surprising that a business which may have dedicated some hardware toward accepting it (e.g. a tablet) will re-purpose said hardware after finding that it's not a frequently used payment option. Until bitcoin integrates seamlessly into the existing infrastructure (as is happening) and is no different to the proprietor than accepting credit/debit, it's not surprising that some give up after a while.

This takes me back to early 2013 when I was facing essentially the same problem, moving money from Canada to Europe. It was a huge hassle, there were many remittance services, all of which sucked in various ways, then I remembered hearing about bitcoin - that was my first experience. The exchanges at the time didn't even have KNC crap, I signed up at Bitstamp and, I think, cavirtex, bought there, sold a few days later on Bitstamp (for a profit I might add, price was rising at the time) and couldn't believe how easy and awesome the experience was. KNC/aml regs have ruined everything though, so who knows what it's like these days.

That's not necessarily incorrect, it should be clear that a *decentralized network* which relies on distributed consensus probably won't be faster than a single entity which requires neither consensus nor a network. The trade off against the speed and efficiency possible with a centralized entity is the trust required of that centralized entity and the regulatory regime in which it operates. For many who have great faith in centralized institutions and their current governments, the decentralized nature of bitcoin isn't much of a selling point.

@_date: 2015-06-27 08:37:28
That is a fair analogy along the lines of the popular narrative. The reality, however, is different. It's not real austerity that is happening... The government is not reducing spending (marginal reduction at best) yet individual/corporate taxes are increasing. This is not real austerity. The government should *massively* shrink along with taxes to encourage businesses and investment, not crush it under an ever increasing tax burden which simply drives business to neighboring countries. All around idiocy. But since the Greeks seem to be calling for more government, the results (economic failure) are preprogrammed.

Sure, the small amount floating in cash. I've lived through currency changes before.

Well, if I understand it correctly, they'll be "bought" in a mandatory exchange at whatever arbitrary (fiat) rate the new currency is introduced at. So it's not a conversion, it's more like a temporary doubling of the money supply because the new currency is created and is used to buy all the euros. Then the euros are used to pay off creditors etc.
But for the average Joe the distinction is academic. One day they see their balance in euros, the next in the new currency.

So what happens to all the euros in Greece right now? They will reenter the rest of Europe and dilute the currency there (=inflation), they don't just cease to exist. And will Draghi stop QE in response? I doubt it. There have been statements from ECB policy advisors that they want the Euro to be par with the dollar.

You're quite an eloquent fellow, I'll give you that. You have expressed the anarcho-communist position fairly succinctly. But there are so many problems with it. To begin, there is no clear way to differentiate "means of production" from any other good barring arbitrary definitions that would require enforcement by a centralized authority, so we're back to square 1. Even the definitions of workplaces and "non-personal" resources is fraught with ambiguity so much so as to be completely useless as a means of organizing society. It is not a coincidence that every single consequential attempt at a marxist/socialist state either ends up as a dictatorship or abondons the system altogether. I don't know much about Catalonia though, beyond the occasional communist-separatist motivated assassination or bombing that makes the news here (in Europe). I had a girlfriend from the region back in 2004 who's father was a literal member of the communist party and elected politician there (and a huge asshole), so there's that.
And I'm sorry, but the comparison with family and friends is just so faulty I don't understand why it is so often repeated.
For the record I'm an anarcho-capitalist of the hoppian variety.

What do they mean by austerity? Higher taxes and slight reduction in (proposed future) state expenditures (aka European joke austerity)? Or *lower taxes* and government cuts (aka actual largely untested austerity)?

It's not as bold as you think. As an example let's take nuclear power. Duplication of effort, since Germany and the USA both worked on it with only limited prewar cross pollination, furthermore effort was concentrated on uranium fission due to bomb potential instead of thorium which can't be used to make bombs. The costs were exorbitant and only would have been invested after cost benefit analysis in a free market. Rocket technology also would have been developed for its obvious applications to travel.

Fruit? Some countries (like the USA) don't allow individuals bringing fresh fruit over the border. I don't see the relevance here, in any case it's the country stopping imports, not exports. For international freight, exports would be virtually impossible to stop. E.g. even of you block Russian boats from your ports, how are you going to prevent boats with different flags from making a delivery to Russia?
edit: OK found article about EU fruit embargoes. What insanity. So, farmers aren't allowed to sell to Russia, and their losses are being compensated by money stolen from eu taxpayers who largely wouldn't support such an idiotic embargo anyway.

This is simply not true. A jury is not an assembly of automatons who decide  algorithmically if law X has been violated. They also judge the morality or applicability of said law in the specific case at hand. This activity is *fundamental* to their purpose. You mention how you find it distasteful that a group of 12 randomly selected individuals have this power, yet give no thought as to how the state's laws themselves come into existence (hint: it isn't much different). 
Of course it isn't a perfect system and you will be able to find   specific historical cases of nullification that in retrospect seem distasteful, but there are many, many more cases where it has been a blessing to the accused. It seems like the only way to bring humanity and reason into an otherwise rigid system of punishment - inasmuch as you are willing to accept state authority in such matters at all.
You write a little like an angry dictator, ruffled by the people's ability to challenge your authority.

Yes and no. The best is to spend and buy again, because the long term viability is directly related to its utility.

The (unlikely) nightmare of pro net neutrality regulation people: your internet provider limits your access to, say, the 100 most popular sites, or some arbitrary list of sites whos provider paid for access.
The (more likely) reality: some providers in a region with little/no competition try it. Most people don't want it so pay for the "unlimited" access package for a reasonable monthly fee. Other poor grannies who just want to check facebook for pictures of their grandkids and read the news pay for the new super cheap $2.50/Mo "common sites package" (because the bandwidth use is essentially subsidized by the site providers). Everyone is happy, except the snotty grandkid who, while visiting his grandma, doesn't enjoy unlimited access.

Beware of modeling functions without a theoretical basis. Basically any curve can be modeled with enough terms/parameters, but there is no way to decide if an extrapolation is in any way meaningful. As a physicist who worked in computational astrophysics, this was a common error I would see in younger students... a randomly selected fit would be applied to a data sample without any understanding of what the result means.

I agree, but there are a few types of people who are victims of theft, and they aren't all equally deserving of sympathy. Let me explain with a simple list, "Worthyness of Sympathy" (WoS) on a scale of 10, where 10 is the most worthy,
* **Type 1**: stubborn Windows XP user. WoS: 0-1. That shit was bad when it was supported, now it's even worse.
* **Type 2**: intelligent, uses web-wallet but too lazy to turn on 2FA, password is literally hunter1: WoS: 0-1. Ima slap you.
* **Type 3**: Windows users in general. Installed all toolbars and craplets that came their way. Visits lots of porn sites, no NoScript, no Adblock, no AV, etc. WoS: 2-3. Get your shit together * **Type 4**: MtGoxers, had 2FA, security dongle, etc. WoS: 5-7, maybe 8. You really didn't heed anyone's warnings??? If it makes you feel any better, all hodlers like me are being robbed by the constantly depreciating valuation these days.
* **Type 5**: Lots of bitcoin on a mobile app. No backup. Phone lost/stolen. WoS: 2. That's just retarted. No words.
* **Type 6**: Uses Linux daily. All reasonable precautions. 2FA, but also Electrum, knows seed by memory. WoS: 9. This type hasn't actually been found yet, their bitcoins aren't being lost/stolen.
* **Type 7**: incompetent and frankly kinda dumb. WoS: 10. Why weren't you helping your friend/relative after introducing them to bitcoin?
* **Type 8**: Multisig, paper wallets, BIP*38*, Bomb-proof bank vault in basement. WoS 11. Seriously dude, chill out. Here's some lorazepam.

Your determination of the "net good" isn't really correct, and is totally subjective. Is the ability of a more people to own a trinket more important that the lives of not only the said "few hundred" workers, but also their dependents?? Unlikely.
The truth which you ignore is that the money people are saving by spending less on an efficiently produced (and therefore inexpensive) widget is free to be invested in *new endeavours*. New endeavours/undertakings require workers... workers which wouldn't have been available if they were still tied up manufacturing trinket in a labour intensive manner. So it is important for the advancement of society that efficiency is increased and labour is freed to enable new industries to grow. E.g. manual telephone switchers -&gt; computer industry, or mechanical looms -&gt; industrial revolution.

Yeah, when you ban it the price drops and investors lose their money, so if you are truly concerned about investors then don't ban it. Look what China did, using the same logic. The funny thing about China was that once they restricted it and the price dropped, they then used that as a post hoc justification for their harsh statements. Circulus vitiosus?

As a physician I fully expected the suicide rate to increase upon reading all the tributes to Robin Williams. It's a well known phenomenon called the Werther effect. I remember learning about it in my psychiatry class and not understanding it at all. Really it's quite ridiculous when you realize the correlation, but it's less about people wanting to emulate said celebrity and more about them being confronted with their own situations and the idea that if the celebrity did it and was honored, maybe it's not so bad...

Try not to get so emotional about it. The same "Fear of Missing Out" attitude that you describe quickly turns into "Panic Sell" when the value drops.

There are factors you aren't considering, like the fiat exchange rate the bank is using which likely includes hidden fees (as it did for me for US-&gt;Eur). But, looking to the future, the *awesome* potential of bitcoin isn't fiat_X &lt;-&gt; bitcoin &lt;-&gt; fiat_Y, but just bitcoin for everything. That time will come at some point, it is *designed* to be an international currency and transfer system.

Sorry, but that's a load of bullocks. If the debt were interest free, than perhaps you'd have a (weak) point, but the interest is certainly higher than inflation - futhermore, the money people earn increases in general at a lower rate than inflation, so still no benefit for the poor.

Apparently that narrative isn't entirely correct and bartering never really was used in place of money on any large scales, but rather a "human ledger" (i.e. memory) about who owes whom what, imperfect though it was.

@_date: 2014-08-28 18:08:27
I am a doctor, and that is a topic quite close to my heart and one that I have spent considerable time examining. As it turns out, most of those costs are not actually related to R&amp;D, but regulatory compliance... And really absurd regulations which are difficult to comply with and encouraged by incumbents. E.g. software for fiber tracking. Brain Voyager with FDA approval? Thousands! Closed source! Almost no competition! 3D slicer? Free, open source, international, cutting edge. But it can't be used clinically due to FDA compliance. That is just one  specific example but it applies to everything in the medical field and drives up costs enormously. I could have written about colchicine, but you can look it up yourself.
So in summary, specifically in the medical/ pharmaceutical industry patents are excused as necessary to pay for the enormous *compliance* costs associated with bringing a product to market. If we were to get rid of both the FDA and patents,  pharmaceuticals would be way more affordable and accessible to the poorest in the world.

Because there aren't any benefits. The result is to increase costs to consumers and reduce supply - and the more money needs to be spent on item A, there less there is to develop item X. Furthermore, patents are only granted for "practical applications", which diverts effort away from R&amp;D. It's not obvious that we are better off with more "practical applications" and less R&amp;D. The original intention of encouraging development by granting a time limited monopoly has failed to provide a net benefit to society as a whole. I say this as someone who actually holds an EU patent for a mechanism of automatically swapping filters in an optical laser system.

Well, that's ancient in bitcoin years. Let's compare it to gold for fun and exercise.
1 Month to 5 years is 1/60 of the age of bitcoin.
Gold has been used since the bronze age, let's say approx 5000 years.
So... 1/60*5000 = 83 years.
In the last 83 years, the US has gone off the gold standard, gold has increased in value ~ 40x. (or the USD has lost that much in purchasing power)
In the last month, Microsoft started accepting bitcoin, the auction happened, development has progressed, price has gone down ~3%.... I'm sure I'm missing a bunch of cool stuff from the last month, can anyone help me out?

I'm willing to bet they will go for something below open market price due to exclusion criteria (purchaser must be in USA, short timeframe) which limits the number of possible buyers.
OTOH there is no way to buy that many coins on an exchange without massively moving the market, so even if the price is somewhat above market, if you really need that many coins there aren't that many other options and it is still probably the cheapest alternative.

Ok this article isn't great, I'll give you all that. But the idea isn't awful. Hear me out.
What he is essentially calling for are two things: 
1. a kind of insurance fund for exchanges, where each exchange voluntarily participates, and membership implies a certain trustworthiness. If you don't live up to expectations you are sanctioned. Fine.
2. a *voluntary* "fractional reserve" system, where you can either have your exchange account 100% backed, or some portion of that (his suggestion 80%), then exchanges could also become bitcoin lending institutions, with your approval.
These would be voluntary systems.
What he's *not* proposing, is a system of "bitcoin printing" or QE or any such nonsense. 
Leaving some of his pro-state intervention rhetoric aside, it's not a bad idea.

Wages have historically followed productivity, and they continue to do so, hence wages increases during  industrialization, when a worker can produce much more in a factory then he could as a subsistence farmer. The value of your work determines your wage, sure, a fry chef works "hard", but doesn't earn as much as a surgeon for fairly obvious reasons relating to education, supply and demand,  responsibility, etc. Same goes for a CEO, for every successful one you hear about there are boatloads of failed ones. High risk for a potential high reward. As for the aforementioned fry cook, low risk for a low reward.

You run it on your computer and interact with it through your web browser. The experience / look / feel is probably closest to eBay. It connects to other computers also running open bazaar, so you can see what the other "shops" are selling. You pay for stuff with bitcoin, with the assistance of an arbiter to reduce the risk of being scammed, and there are other cool things about it, e.g. you can use bitmessage for messaging (basically a simple built-in messenger), and shops/sellers can be rated and can build trust by paying for their presence by irrevocably investing bitcoin into their store name (so you know that they are not fly by night scammers). It's really cool but definitely not finished - e.g. product search doesn't seem to be working for me, I have to browse each shop's offerings individually. Has great potential though, and I'm looking forward to the day when I can find and sell most things I need with it and don't have to rely on eBay anymore.

I'm just going to reply to your last point about inflation. I can't think of a business that "plans" for inflation, except, perhaps, circumstantially when thinking about wage raises. They sell their product/service at a price sufficient to cover costs, and which potential customers are willing to pay, or they go out of business. It's pretty simple, really. The primary effect of inflation is to rob people of their savings, the particular rate of plunder is rather irrelevant - be it 2% or 6%.

In multiple myeloma he surely would have been anemic (healthy blood building cells need to compete with cancer cells in the bone marrow), likely poor kidney function due to injury by the overproduction of diseased immune globulins, likely compensatory hepatomegaly and splenomegaly for blood building, poor immune status... the body can only compensate so many failing systems for so long.

Subjectively, yes, but in any case to a much lesser extent than laws vary over time or from place to place. Murder and theft, for example, are afaik universally considered evil (through time and place). There are objective moral truths, but I'm not going to write a philosophical treatise here.

I was speaking specifically about currency debasement, i.e. the printing of money to finance war. There would still be wars of sorts, but if the money first had to be raised, enthusiasm for world wars and extended combats would quickly dry up. Do you think people would be giving billions to Israel, or would have spend trillions in Iraq if each household had to pay 50 grand or so? I doubt it. Wars would involve clear and present immediate dangers with clear targets and well defined terms, not endless wars on drugs and terrorism etc

Right, but that would still severely cripple them, they wouldn't be able to "create" money, or manipulate interest rates.

Do you seriously think that anyone is going to use iMoney as a store of value, hedge against inflation, or anything other than buying stuff on iTunes? Where will it be tradable? Will it empower micro transactions or be usable for cross border transactions like bitcoin? Somehow I doubt it. It will be a centralized credit system useful to a few people in the developed world with iPhones, likely linked to the us dollar, just faster, safer perhaps than credit cards. Will save Apple on credit card fees, and there will likely be tons of unused credit from people loading up money then never using it.

Basically everything revolutionary and new.
EDIT also think of it this way. Most bitcoiners aren't too enthused about altcoins. Well, bitcoin is the "altcoin" of the fiat world.

The best scenario for everyone involved - including the Chinese, is a slow-and-steady underground adoption, few if any exchanges within Chinese borders, person-to-person trades, a free market "shadow" economy, no large points of failure [huobi, btcchina, etc]. That may happen, and the chinese central banksters know it, so they refrain from an outright ban which would push the above scenario. Instead they let people keep their coins and money on Chinese exchanges and use threats and fear to keep adoption low.
TL;DR It's in the the interest of the the Chinese gov't to keep the exchanges running but adoption low through constant threats and FUD.

Easy. They send a notice of seizure to the bitcoin CEO who then tells one of his employees to lock down the account of said terrorist (Mr. X). Once the funds have been locked down and Mr. X goes to the nearest bitcoin branch to ask why he can't log-in to the bitcoin website and transfer his money to Iran, the FBI jumps on him and roughs him up a bit. Then they carefully place his bitcoins in tamper proof bags so as not to damage evidence such as traces of explosives / DNA from sperm or other cells / middle-eastern type bacteria on the coin's surface and send them off for forensic examination.

Your first statement is pure ad hominem - poisoning the well. You  discredit the sources based on association with something you dislike rather than the content of the arguments... In the first case by employees of the fed, in the second a patent attorney. Though it could just as easily be Tom, Dick, and Harry, the research and arguments stand on their own merit.
As to the rest, purely unsubstantiated claims reflecting the generally understood *intention* of the law, not its actual results.
And yes, you're right, the system can be fixed - by discarding it entirely.

I'd say they are generally *not* a poor financial decision.

There's no reason in particular why a similar "deferred payment" system for bitcoin couldn't be implemented. Circle, for example, could "loan bitcoin" for payments, to be repayed in bitcoin with interest. If there is demand for such a system, it will be created. Heck, if American Express wanted in, this could be their opportunity. Their own CEO identified an opportunity.
Also, he seems like a reasonable guy, he made no hard pronouncements, admitted that he doesn't know how it is going to evolve, and that there's probably room for new forms of money and payments systems.

I really love drama, but I'd also love to just settle this damn issue and move on. I feel kinda bad for Gavin tbh, got a lot of pressure on him to not fuck up, and lots of opposition. Being a medical doctor I've been in situations where people's lives are on the line and there is no clear solution, lots of talk, lots of humming and hawing, but no action.  Everyone is just relieved when someone takes the reigns and says *this is what we are going to do and this is how we are going to do it*. Being a decision maker means also being able to take the blame for failure - I think, at least in the medical field, that is part of the reason hesitation is common. Nobody want their neck to be on the chopping block when the treatment turns out to be incorrect. 
I realize that a decentralized system doesn't operate the same way, yet there are parallels. Andresen still clearly has both competence and a leadership role, and his decision will be followed by the majority of the network. He must consider the opposition, but in the end just decide.

No, it's not difficult to imagine at all. Patents are not central to western society. They only exist in anything like their modern form since the very recent past ~ 100 years. And the fields that develop most quickly are those least encumbered.

To short, you have to borrow bitcoin, sell it in the hope that the price will be going down, then buy it back with some extra to pay the interest to the lender. It's not obvious that it would cause any long-term price decline, since all bitcoin sold have to be bought back plus some.

@_date: 2015-05-17 22:37:32
While I generally agree, I have a problem with the principle applied in your argument: you are taking a consequentialist position "What is most beneficial *for society as a whole*". I dislike this approach because it gives legitimacy to the notion that individual rights can be trampled if by so doing a larger group benefits. No! If a person is not causing harm / depriving another person of property without their consent, then no third party (state or otherwise) has any say in the matter. And when I say "property" I mean tangible property as commonly understood, not the legal pseudo construct of *intellectual* property.

Sorry but that's not quite right, where would the "sold" but "unbought" bitcoin end up? Limbo? Truth is the bid and ask prices are not the same, so if you "market sell" you fill the order of the highest bidder. More market sells than buys drives the price down, conversely more market buys than sells pushes the price up.
@_date: 2015-01-25 10:01:41

So... what does the fucking thief do with his bitcoin? He likely doesn't give two shits about bitcoin’s future and just wants cash pronto. Stamp wants its coin back and could potentially use its venture capital for that purpose. So the thief offers to sell the coin back to Bitstamp for, e.g. $4M OTC. It would be the best situation, retrieve coin below market, don't have to move market to restock.
Alternative for Bitstamp is to buy on the market, but that would move the market considerably and cost them way more in the end.
I don't know what else the thief could do, really. Localbitcoins. J/k

OK, I guess we are referring to different aspects of scalability.

The interesting thing about you is that you have been a redditor for a long time - longer than bitcoin has been around. Yet, as far back as I cared to scroll, your singular purpose seems to be to troll bitcoin. Actually, I failed to find a single post regarding anything else. Most of your output is semi incoherent invective. But I wonder what your motivation is? What is it about a tiny, virtually insignificant  (by any global scale) piece of open source code that elicits so much hatred? Is it because some people value it and you don't? Is it due to a misguided sense of duty to save the world? Honestly, what is your motivation?

I've given some thought to how to make use of bitcoin on reddit in a totally non-intrusive yet advantageous way. I don't know what they have cooking, but this is what I'd do:
1. Opt in.
2. Once you've opted in you can load your reddit account with some coin.
3. You can then spend your bitcoin by upvoting. If you upvote someone who isn't opted in, nothing special happens. If the person is opted in, they get 10 bits or whatever, perhaps each click is 10 bits, downvote resets.
That's pretty much it. People would want to opt in to get some free bits. An easy/integrated way to load your upvote wallet would be nice though.

Huge OTC sales going on relative to decreasing volume on sites like bitstamp. Circle, etc.,  purchases don't (directly) push prices up since they don't have order books. Exchanges with relatively low liquidity are easy to manipulate, and so is the mood around here, apparently. The lower the price of bitcoin, the easier is the manipulation.
As to motives, I'm not sure, but one possibility is profiting from futures contracts (shorting the market). Since exchanges seem to follow each other, you could, e.g. have BTC swaps on a Chinese exchange, then dump on bitstamp (easier to crash), and the Chinese exchage will likely follow.

I totally disagree with the parent as well, but to be fair you ought to discern between *the internet* (OSI Levels 1-6) and *the internet* (as commonly understood) to be the application level (OSI level 7). "The government" was somewhat involved in the development of some of the protocols, but was by no means alone. The current infrastructure and all other aspects are of course overwhelmingly private.
My main point against these arguments of "look at all the stuff the state has created for us" is a simple cost/benefit analysis: So, the state costs us XXX trillions, and we get a bunch of that money wasted on beurocrats, a bunch spent on secret military type projects which, if at all, will only benefit the rest of society when they are declassified, and some random crapola. What would the private citizens have chosen to produce with that wealth had it been left with them?
In any case, how embarrassing would it be for the statists if they had absolutely nothing positive to show for the enormous costs of the state?

That's fine that you don't like that, I guess you could request that people don't remix your music and always credit you, you could create a binding contact with each customer and stipulate penalties for breach. Likely it would be more hassle than it's worth and you'd lose potential customers. The alternative you support is to get the law involved, which always implies violence. E.g. violator is fined for copyright infringement, can't pay the fine, is summoned to court, misses the date, receives a summary judgement, bailiff enters home to seize property, owner protests, tempers rise, somebody gets shot...

Rest of the bullshit aside, you have completely misunderstood the regression theorem, which holds that for a money to develop, it must first be a useful commodity in wide circulation. Bitcoin is a useful commodity based on its use in trade - censorship resistant and international.

Someone please answer me this. If BIP101 harbours such a centralization risk by favoring large pools over small players then why are the large pools apparently more supportive of BIP100 (which gives them actual voting power based on their hashrate)? They must not consider BIP101 to be as potentially advantageous to them (by forcing out smaller competitors) as the voting power afforded by BIP100. Either way, given those two choices only, BIP101 would seem to be the better choice for those supporting decentralization - simply by merit of large pool preference. 
Furthermore, with the power afforded miners by the vote, and the concentration of hashing power in China, is it not conceivable that a hostile Chinese government could force down the block size to keep Bitcoin insignificant? I certainly wouldn't put it past them.
Edit: thanks for the downvotes, it's a friendly reminder how far gone this sub is now.

Even small blockers want to scale Bitcoin with lightening or whatever which will presumably be cheap / free, so fewer high transaction fees on chain will not necessarily mean more mining revenue. In any case Bitcoin isn't so established that expensive transactions will be tolerated by users. People will just move to whatever option is cheapest, of which there are plenty. So I understand your point, miners may try to artificially limit block size to maximize their revenue, but by so doing they may be shooting themselves in the foot. No normal Bitcoin user could possibly want high transaction fees.

The purpose of theft is not *theft*, but to enrich the thieves. That is the purpose of taxation: the state demands a tithe from the little ones, parasitic state employees enriching themselves at the expense of the productive population. Occasionally morbus state will toss us a bone so that we think we're getting something for the 1/2 of our productive lives wasted in support of the "public sector" (LOL). The specific chemotherapy we need to control the spread of state is a currency they can neither manufacture nor steal - bitcoin.

A few years ago I was at a train station on my way from Munich to Vienna, and needed some food, so I bought a crapass sandwich from a kiosk for ~$10. It was tiny and non-delicious, so I felt ripped off. On the train I dozed off and while I slept someone pulled all the cash out of my wallet, ~$200. I wished the sandwich had cost *more*, just to keep the money out of the thief's hands. At least the sandwich purchase was voluntary.
TL;DR, I'll take volatility over theft any day, or bitcoin over a potential "haircut", account freeze, planned devaluation, etc. But I'm not Greek so who the hell knows.*

I'd rather rid myself of fiat than bitcoin, so unless there's an incentive for me to spend my bitcoin other than the "cool" factor, I may not. A discount is a good incentive, especially since the seller is saving money by using bitcoin, and a bitcoin incentive would also encourage more people to buy his product while generating free support/advertising from the small group of happy bitcoiners who shop there.

*Riding a bike* can be quite dangerous and hopefully will be shut down/well regulated soon. Does anyone here know what happens when you get into a wreck on a bicycle? If it's your fault and you didn't tell your insurance provider that you ride a bicycle [=risky behaviour] you might be uninsured. Meaning; you could end up paying your own medical bills should you make a mistake and be uninsured. Bicycle industry and riders have danced loophole game to keep themselves in a "legal" state but the reality is, they aren't licensed in many cities with the police(as all rikshaw have had to do in most states). They are granted the same priority of a public servant such as a cop, firefighter or bus driver. The are also drug tested and background checked to insure saftey of the public, something bike riders have danced around). A cheap alternutive? Sure. But there are reasons bikes should be illegal and they can't dance around the law like that. Also the reason most states, mine included(Florida) is setting up new guidelines requiring them to follow the same procedure. Bike riders are fighting to stay in the legal grey area. I go to city counsel meetings to fight agains them when I can. Usually their only argument is "A cheap and healthy alternative to other means of transport" but blissfully ignore the fact that they put their lives at risk every day.
Tl;dr Bicycles and the biking industry are a joke, won't be around long unless they conform and become like other transportation companies. Can confirm, am rikshaw rider dealing with bicycles. (Doctors don't accept bit coin payments)

Well, yes, but my point is that tax=theft, so what your saying is equivalent to saying the purpose of *theft* is theft, which isn't necessarily wrong, but doesn't really get us any closer to actual motivations.

- no competition + other privileges associated with fulfilling a government contract usually relating to liability, etc.
- unionized
How would it work in a free market?
- I'm not 1 million people each making their own choices, but I suspect that many people, given the choice, would not want to hire a company that dumps their garbage in the nearest lake, and were it to be discovered that a company were engaging in such practices, by, for example, a consumer watchdog, they would quickly be out of business.  Furthermore, in a free market all property is private, so where would they be dumping?

Well sure I don't believe bitcoin is big there, but I think the reasons are more related to lack of knowledge (never heard of it/don't know what it is) and lack of liquidity to purchase than the overly negative attitudes you quoted above. Furthermore, only a relatively small part of the Greek population will be doing much remittance/overseas commerce with bitcoin accepting businesses, so there is also a lack of an obvious use case for most (in their eyes). You may be surprised at how trusting many people are of their governments/banks to solve the current issues.

The Catholic church is completely decentralized. The pope has no command over the church, he's a "slave" to tradition, not a monarch who can act with impunity or president with executive orders. Not long ago the vast majority of Catholics neither knew nor cared who the pope even was. The only thing special about him is the recognition of infallibility in matters of faith and morals, a very rarely called upon ability which is very narrow and essentially boils down to dispute resolution in light of tradition.

I'm super stoked to keep my node running as a settlement later. I'll never be able to afford to use it myself with $5 transaction fees, but I'll remain super loyal and keep my computer running 24/7 to promote decentralization for the super rich out of the goodness of my heart.

I find it hilarious that the proponents of expensive transactions aka "fee market", 1 MB blocks, and Bitcoin as a settlement later expect that bleak future to "promote decentralization".

Banning cash is not about stopping crime, it never was and never will be. The claim that the ban is to stop terrorist financing is truly as absurd as the claim that attacking Iraq was about WMDs. It's just a lie to get a scared populace to accept draconian statist measures. Think of the children! Crime in general and terrorism in particular will always be possible, there will always be financing alternatives to the fiat de jour. For every obstacle the state puts up, a new alternative will be born. As long as there are people willing to perform evil deeds - and there will be as long as human nature remains flawed, there will be crime.
The first and foremost reason for the potential ban is to prevent people from saving money when the interest rates go negative. As an additional bonus for proponents of state control, such measures facilitate the panopticon of a truly totalitarian state. Crime, however, will remain outside its purview, as it will be financed by alternative or obfuscated means.

No, a free market leads to demonopolization, the opposite of your "evident" claim. In corporatism, which has nothing to do with free markets, industries receive advantages through state power. With the help of the state in the form of intellectual property laws, regulatory capture, various tax benefits or subsidies / grants, wage laws, etc, monopolization occurs. Monopolies can really only exist with the help of the state [barring certain concocted examples e.g. only water supply being on farmer Jones' land]. Your conclusion simply doesn't follow your flawed argumentation. A much more thorough analysis has already been performed, see e.g. Ledger and Peter Rizun's work.

But baked into all "Democratic" systems is the implicit assumption that the majority can dictate terms to the minority. Although that may seem reasonable on face value, it leads to system which is necessarily tyrannical and unjust to a segment of the population. And that segment is left with little to no recourse. It can "work" to a certain degree in a culturally homogenous population, but then in such a region it would at the same time be redundant.

I just started using purse.io recently and am really happy with it. I prefer spending my bitcoin this way as opposed to buying directly from merchants that accept bitcoin for two main reasons:
1. the bitcoin is getting into the hands of individuals who are not immediately cashing out, so it's "spreading the wealth" so to speak, rather than getting instantly converted to 100% fiat and sold in huge batches in OTC trades to people who already have a lot.
2. it's cheaper than buying directly (unless the shop offers a significant discount for using bitcoin)

While conceivable that a mania/bubble could be created at great expense and the subsequent bear market aided on the down trend by strategic dumps of coins accumulated during the pre/mania phase, it would cost a great deal with no guarantee of success and is thus unlikely. More effective is manipulating perception through relatively inexpensive social media campaigns. I'm not sure if this is happening or if the haters are just haters by nature (the world is full of such people), but it would at least have better chances of success with lower risk.

EDIT: the choices are 
1. *cash*: zero transaction fee, but taxes and other hidden costs. (do you know how much it costs to make fiat? Count it? Transport it, etc? Do you know what role it plays in pandemics such as influenza?)
2. *credit*: retailer pays ~3%, passes cost on to consumer by raising prices
3. *debit*: your bank account aint free
3. *bitcoin*: customer pays mining fee, or not. In either case, free for retailer. (excluding possible payment processor fees)
TL;DR no such thing as free lunch.

The article is somewhat misleading in its presentation of history by implying that the Catholic church was someone opposed to the notion of "zero" when, in fact, it was one on the popes [Sylvester II]( who introduced the concept into the western world (a few hundred years before the quoted period in the article).

Speaking in my capacity as a medical doctor and not as a bitcoin enthusiast, I'm honestly pretty worried about you and Mr. Andresen. Fighting a seemingly endless stream of attacks against your person and, perhaps more importantly, your contributions, can take a psychological toll. Now, of course it would be great to take a vacation, but we both know that that probably isn't going to happen, and even if it did, it is difficult to "shut down" from the intellectual types of arguments you are involved in. So the best I can do is at least offer my support and assure you that you have many supporters at least in the blocksize debate, many of whom are being blacked out in this particular subreddit.

This risk of death from childbirth in developed nations is very low, and the vast majority of pregnancies didn't happen by accident - the mothers are not being used, in your words, "as incubators," in some sort of dystopian industrial scale baby farm, but were party to the pregnancy, so to speak.

The odd thing about this argument, excluding the obvious point that one's convenience shouldn't trump another's right to life, is the double standard that pro choice people have applied to me personally.

Well that's a tough one, let's see. Blocks are not trucks. Blocks are not armored. Transactions are not of equal value in any way analogous to equally denominated dollar bills. I don't find that the analogy in any way furthers my understanding of the issue. Particularly the "armor" comparison is a tad disingenuous.
Let's take the analogy further. Buses/trucks are more efficient at transporting the same quantity of goods than individual transport would be and thus have less environmental impact. Trucks are harder to stop. It's easier to hide contraband in them. They can travel further without refueling.

Edit: Even if amazon started taking bitcoin directly, I'd still use purse since a) discounts! b) bitcoin is going as bitcoin directly into the hands of people who want it, not being insta-converted to fiat via a payment processor [yes I understand that payment processors sell their coins to people who want them, so at the end of the day it doesn't make much difference, still, feels better this way]

Oh no, the old "viability" argument.
1. Viability is a moving target. Now with intensive medical care in a well equipped center premature babies can occasionally survive who are born around ~21 weeks, true. A few years ago it was ~25 weeks. So a few years ago, were the unborn &lt; 25 weeks not worthy? And what happens in a few years? What does viable even mean? Completed organogensis? Well that puts at week 8. Heart beat? Shit, that puts us at week 4.
2. You make a reference to support via "own life force." Ok. So I guess we can exclude anyone &lt; 2 years, and include all manner of single celled organisms and other primitive life forms or even extremely early pregnancies (which can survive in the right medium without "medical care"), and exclude everything after the first 2 weeks or so after conception.

The thing that I honestly find baffling is how the argument that "benign tech x is used by criminals" is even relevant to any serious discussion. Why is it repeated over and over such that it practically dominates every discussion with government or media? Who cares if bitcoin is used by criminals? Everything people use is also used by criminals. And more baffling still is the lack of concrete examples. If it enables terrorism, show us how. The guy's argument is just that in the last 10 years they've seen a 66% increase in small orders for drugs, probably thanks to dark nets, thus bitcoin.  Some steps seem to be missing in that chain of illogic.

I'm sorry, but "fiat" doesn't mean "price subject to free market valuation", but rather "by government decree". So, although the value of a fiat currency is *influenced* by the forex markets, it is also subject to manipulation and price fixing by a central bank, and has a regional monopoly enforced by the state - not exactly the same thing as bitcoin.

I have been tricked by a practiced scamster face-to-face before, cheated out of $80 that I had to get out of a bank machine first. It is really really hard not to be cheated by a practiced conman (woman in my case), *especially* face to face. It's hard to suppress the desire to be polite and trusting against the wish to not be cheated. Obviously this depends somewhat on your disposition, but many people are at least semi trusting by default. Gavin was in a very vulnerable position, best situation for a Wright - he'd flown a long distance, been "worked on" before the "proof", encouraged by peers (Matonis)... By all accounts Wright has a dominating, convincing personality. The whole thing is sad and fucked up.

That's a fine thing to say, and in truth I can even code Qt/C++. With a lot of time I could probably get up to speed on Bitcoin and maybe even contribute something useful. But the reality is that I don't have enough free time between being a full time medical doctor and father of a growing family. I prefer that those who already have the requisite skills (yourself included) use them to benefit the whole network with a similar prioritisation schedule to what I envision. Topping my priority list as a normal Joe is obviously consumer usability with everything that implies - primarily confirmation times (which further implies a blocksize increase and not nixing zero conf). If your understanding of "benefit" differs significantly from mine and ends up dominating Bitcoin, then I must with great regret cease any and all involvement.

Nobody can tell you if you should worry. But I think of it this way... Anything bitcoin related, though not specifically illegal in the vast majority of places, are perceived to be related to crime (true or not). It doesn't seem too far fetched that at least a few governments would be interested in having some manner of control over it, or targeting users of bitcoin in one way or another. People buying bitcoin related hardware are obvious targets.

Yeah, it's still not making a lot of sense. The calls for German wages to rise "more sharply" is mostly driven by socialists and unions with their erroneous notion that there should be some sort of causal relationship between wages and productivity [implied linear], when in reality wages ought to be set by supply/demand like any other product or service. In a free market, and there are historical (and current) examples of this, wages rise naturally with productivity, there is no need to force this according to some arbitrary criteria.
You sink production costs by reducing the cost of inputs, of course wages are a part of it, but so are raw materials. A strong currency for an export industry and nation which relies almost entirely on foreign imports is entirely logical, so devaluing the currency isn't going to help Germany. And wages, although there is certainly some collusion in certain industries, are by and large not "suppressed" in any meaningful way and people are willing to work for the wages they are earning.

No, (public) cartels are state sanctioned monopolies.

Yes, p2pool, popular among small time miners with rigs in their basements, has been the one mining most of the blocks so far, and AntPool (17% of hashrate ) has voiced non-commital support. Slush (7%) was also and may again mine bip101 blocks (they were scared off by the DOS attacks). I think some of the XT nodes have gone "stealth" due to the DOS attacks. So, there may be more support than node count implies, and latent support just waiting for the right signal.

Good question, complex answer. I'd like to just refer you to the sidebar in But briefly (I'm at work and don't have the time to write an essay), people want things, so entrepreneurs create the things to satisfy demand.
To say that people are inherently lazy is quite a bold assertion, and certainly not one that is born out by the world around us. Sure, people enjoy vacation more than work, but they also work without labor-camp type coercion. And people are generous - oddly inversely proportional to the socialization of their surrounding, e.g. fewer charitable healthcare institutes and scholarship/bursary programs in Europe than USA.
As to emergency services: the Red Cross, etc, existed long before government got involved. Police? No thanks. [Private security would be preferrable](

This is something you have to decide for yourself. I personally bought a small amount in 2013, lost most of it trading, since then have been a buyer &amp; holder, slowly increasing my stash. I'm pretty emotionally stable, so I'm not overly affected by this bear market.

We won't need roads (as much). Autonomous flying transportation devices, aka drones will be the main means of transportation. Where roads were we'll have forests and parks.

Private roads / raceways / scenic routes will be built/maintained where desired.

Now, I was with you until you started talking about German wages. That is not true. Wages in Germany, in general, are *higher* that, e.g. Spain. I have experience in this first hand. Furthermore, Germany only recently (within the last year) introduced a minimum wage. Individuals, or collectives (of a certain trade - as represented by a union) were free to negotiate their own contracts.
TL;DR Germany doesn't artificially suppress wages. Where do you even come up with this stuff?

Physician here. The alcohol theory may hold some water, but I think it's also a question of perception, like "hey look at us, sure we sell beer but we care about people which is why we support anti drug legislation." Maybe. Who knows.
But the pharmaceutical industry is more complicated. I'm fairly confident that they don't fear *competition* from currently illegal drugs, I mean, there nothing stopping from marketing them themselves if that were the case. No. The problem is that they fear competition from unregulated markets. You could/can buy all kinds of *prescription* drugs for much cheaper on dark markets - chemically identical knock offs. Sometimes even the same product shipped from India where prices are much lower. That is the real reason. They have a huge regulatory framework set up to keep out competition, and they lobbied hard and long for it for many years. They're not just going to throw it out the window and expose themselves to real competition.

I appreciate your position, as it is one I too once held. However, there is no realistic way to "stop terrorism" by limiting everyone's freedoms, since it is motivated by an idea, and generally provoked by state action - e.g. the US's disastrous middle eastern interventionist policies. See, e.g. the history and motivations of ISIS and its various predecessors. As to the rest, the idea of "public goods" have been laid to rest on numerous occasions, see, e.g. [here]( infrastructure can and has been created by private industry. As to the police...

... because I haven't seen any evidence that Obamacare is an improvement over the corporatist system it "replaces". I'd like to see convincing evidence from a macro perspective that healthcare as a whole has improved - and that people in general are better off (yes, sometimes less healthcare and more X is better too - it's a trade off). So far all I've seen are a few emotionally charged "case reports" which bear no statistical weight.
By the way, I assume you're from Australia - I'm not overly familiar with your system, I know it's socialized in some way. I'm a physician (radio oncologist) in Germany.

I think you do not realize the significance of his statement. It is most absolutely an endorsement, much more so than anything Gates ever said (I maintain Gates never endorsed bitcoin at all and actually has been poo-pooing it all along, but that's another story). This is the former head of the two largest Swiss banks - *Swiss banks*. And he's saying bitcoin is likely **among the only long term stores of value**. There is a small but growing contingent of people who understand bitcoin to be the "Swiss bank" of the future, especially considering the new draconian international treaties on the sharing of private banking info and elimination of tax havens. Bank secrecy is dead - bitcoin isn't.

I'm Catholic but I disagree with the pope strongly on this point. I accept that it is the duty of people to help their neighbors, of the rich to help the poor, etc.. but beyond that is where our opinions diverge. He seems to think that government is in a position to ensure "fairness", yet the problems he lists are not the product of free market capitalism, but rather corporatism, regulation. More government is not going to *help* poor people, it will *harm* them. Jesus wanted us to be generous and help people wherever possible, he didn't want governments to force people to "help". Where is the merit in that? It was always an act of free will, not coercion. Advocating for more goverment is advocating for coercion, a singularly uncatholic philosophy IMO.
For other catholics who are unsure what to think, bear in mind that this is the pope expressing his opinion on economic matters, with the intention of best helping the poor. You are free to disagree, as this is not a binding statement on faith and morals. We, as catholics, are still bound to help the less fortunate in any way we can, however.

I'd tell them that change isn't always a bad thing. Banks, per se, are, for now, a necessary part of the economy - for loans, etc.. But they are expensive. If one industry collapses, others can be created from the wealth saved. That is how society as a whole advances. Imagine if the spinning mule, for example, had been outlawed due to the efficiencies it introduced into the textile industry. But the weavers! What ever will they do! They'll starve! No... tbey won't, they are now available for new industries, and can buy two shirts and three pairs of pants rather than one shirt and no pants due to the reduction in production costs. See bitcoin. 2-3% of virtually all transactions are going to banks now. If that money could be funnelled back into the economy, it could grow by that much or more.
But it's not realistic to imagine that bitcoin will replace banks or other credit institutes anytime within the forseeable future, there will be room for both for a long time, even if bitcoin eventually dominates, there will still be room for credit institutes based around bitcoin to do essentially the same thing they are doing now.

True and valid point, but there are many many more US dollars now (total money supply has increased), the total number of dollars has increased by more than 9 times since then (more like tens or hundreds of thousands of times).

Maybe, but it already offers significant value as a (temporary) storage medium for wealth as people rush to save their Euros from the clutches of government. Sometime fear of government theft or debasement is greater than a fear of a bitcoin crash. It all depends of your country, I guess.

The advantages of international fund transfer and an ever increasing number of businesses which accept bitcoin is just icing on the cake.

1. never use the same password anywhere twice. Passwords should not be dictionary words, should contain a mix of capitalization, punctuation, numbers, etc.. A good trick is to take the first letter of a short phrase you can remember, e.g.: "My mother likes red boats, like, a lot! Yeah 2 my bro." = Mmlrb,l,al!Y2mb.  Should be more than 9 chars.
2. Google Authenticator / two-factor authentication wherever possible.

Kidnapping *and* theft. They would have to return the money or pay back in some other way. That isn't really an argument for "money laundering", especially since it is a very fringe case.

I don't think any non clinically insane person "likes" people being shot, American or otherwise. This, however, has nothing to do with that. Bullets have uses beyond killing humans. In your defense, however, you are European. Excepting Switzerland, perhaps, most guns are in state hands, and states certainly don't use them for much beyond murder and intimidation. Disclaimer: I also live in the EU (Germany) but realize anti gun paranoia is just that. If you want to stop people from being murdered, banning guns isn't a great way to go about it. Here's a more fundamental motivator: alcohol. And here are more common implements: fists, knives, blunt objects, poison. Murder rates [aren't all that different](  especially when you consider demographics and the results of gang warfare and the war on drugs.

Which brings me to my second point. The more valuable bitcoins become, the more lucrative attacks are. There are many ways to secure your accounts and bitcoins, but here are some general pointers:
1. Never use the same password twice. A good trick is to use a phrase, including punctuation, and take the first letter from each word. Must be greater than 9 characters. E.g. my car is a piece of crap with only three good wheels, this website makes me wanna puke = Mciapocwo3gw,twmmwp! Not bad, hey?
2. If you have to use windows, anti virus, firewall, etc., no internet explorer no matter how flashy their commercials are. Better to use Linux, e.g. Ubuntu, even if you are only running it in a VM for bitcoin management. Same goes for online banking, actually. Disable java, use no script, ad block...
3. Encrypt you wallet at least, home folder or whole drive.
4. Keep your bitcoins on your own computer and backup to a thumb drive.
@_date: 2013-04-26 18:47:30
Any one will put you in a more secure category than Windows. But the weak link seems to be online wallets and (Android?) smartphones, at least judging by the "I was robbed" posts that have been popping up the last few days.

True, but I think the biggest problem is not very many people actually use bitcoin, so it's a bit of chicken-and-egg problem. If there were a lot of users the ATMs in airports could be profitable. Of course there is a risk that the operators would lose out big if they can't recoup their operating costs, but there is a risk with every investment. 
1. Start small: Heathrow, Kennedy, for example. 
2. Advertise availability, make sure at least the current bitcoin users know about it. 
3. Keep rates as low as possible to ensure comparison with established methods (via exchange stands or banks) is good.
It would probably make more sense for exchange stands themselves to just offer bitcoin purchases/sales alongside fiat currencies -- the infrastructure is already in place.
@_date: 2013-05-16 13:17:31
I sold most of mine at $105 like a complete arse, thinking the price would drop way more and I could buy back in, thus increasing my share of bitcoin. Instead I perfectly timed the absolute bottom of the slump. I just donated a portion when I inevitably buy back in at $120 or so. $!*#

You are not the first person to ask this question, and libertarians / agorists / what-have-you would also like some shared services. There are severall possible solutions, all of which are reasonable, and none of which require an invasive arbitrary and overly expensive government for implementation. If you take the position that roads, police, parks (and possibly utilities like water) should be public, that would be more in line with minarchists who believe in a very small limited government with a clearly defined role. I don't believe even the most hardcore libertarian will tell you that not being allowed to murder someone is an infringement of your rights, because the right to life (and essentially be left alone) is sort of the primordial right from which all others are derived. Who would enforce private protection and some form of legal framework in the absense of government? A sort of volountary government with an actual contract with the people in its jurisdiction, private security, arbitrators to settle disputes, that sort of thing. You'll have to look elsewhere for implementation details, like Hans Hermann Hoppe's work.

You might be able to murder someone and get away with it. That doesn't make it ok. You can do that now, too, FWIW.

you miss the point, I'm not saying bitcoin isn't real money, I'm referring to the imagined value of the bitcoins in fiat, i.e.  1 BTC = $250 suddenly being 1 BTC = $50, then thinking "I lost $200". That's not the right way to go about it.

You claiming something doesn't make it true. If I need milk now, I will buy milk now, even if someone tells me it might be on sale tomorrow. Same goes for electronics, prices are always falling and quality is going up, yet people don't delay purchases indefinitely.

Good response, my only critique is the comparison with alcohol, drugs etc during prohibition. Those items have their supply curtailed by the state but demand remains strong, so of course price goes up (demand &gt;supply, price goes up). Bitcoins, if banned, would not have a supply problem at all, but demand would likely go down (more difficult to purchase coins, more difficult to spend them), and therefore value (supply&gt;demand, value goes down).

I hear it said often that people are buying coins at MtGox to transfer to other exchanges and sell at a loss, however, the evidence so far has all been circumstantial. I'd like to make a formal request for anyone who has done this to comment here. Surely *one* of you is reading this thread...
...as a side note, the price on all exchanges is going up, I see little to no evidence of an overabundance of sell orders on Bitstamp by looking at the order book.
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:37:28
It can't be stable from the get go. Valuation is still ongoing and there are a few people with a lot of coin who can cause mass fluctuations if they so desire. IMO stability will follow when a lot of people have a few coins, rather than a few people having a lot.
@_date: 2013-05-22 17:25:46
If you tried to do this with bitcoin through exchanges, you would cause chaos: the market is too small to absorb that kind of value without massive price fluctuations.

I really hate jealousy. Guess what? I have 10 bitcoins that I bought for $1000. Am I mad that other people had the foresight to invest in an early unproven system when the initial investment was comparatively small? No. I'm fucking happy. If it weren't for them, we wouldn't be talking about it today. Who are you to determine what is "fair"? I'd rather they get rewarded for their smart choices which benefit all bitcoin users than some wall street chump who uses political influence to get free money.

If you wanted to push it down below $100, you'd have to sell $7 Million worth of coin right now, and that is excluding all the buy orders that would come flooding in if the floor suddenly dropped out of the market for no apparent reason. I can't see your prediction coming true.

CP existed before liberty reserve or bitcoin and will continue to exist for the forseeable future. As long as there are scumbags and children, CP (or more generally sexual exploitation of children) will continue to exist. I'm all for smoking out the scum that produces that filth, but goverments, I suspect, use the CP card as more of a catch all "think of the children!" cover when going after anything they don't like.

Your scenario for deflation in the current system excludes a very important detail: banks would likely be willing to renegotiate a contract before accepting default, so should deflation be a significant problem for debtors, contract terms will be changed such that the amount to be repayed would reflect the actual value of the loan.

A German friend of mine was visiting today, who's never really heard of bitcoins (before I mentioned them to him).

I don't understand what the problem is. As the price of bitcoin rises, more people will want it. *Businesses operators* are also people and will want it. If you have bitcoins, and there is nothing you want to buy, don't buy anything. The market will adapt until there *is* something you want/need. Holding a currency isn't evil.

True, and I'm not sure how the law is supposed to work, and don't even live in the USA, but I'd guess that you are trading bitcoins for some product/service (barter trade) that may not be covered by the proposed legislation. When you trade your bitcoins for USD, you pay tax on that income.

I fully understand the motivation of governments to consider bans, etc.. I imagine that were I a despot, I too would want control over the money supply so that I could print "money" ad nauseam to reward my friends, etc. If I were democratic or motivated by a genuine desire to help, then the people of my country would have all the more reason to fear me: my desire to help them would be all the greater, as would the probability of wrecking everything. All my power would rely on control of the money supply, or at the very least, enough loyal strongmen to tax the populace at will.
But I imagine a ban would play out differently. Instead of destroying bitcoin, a single country outlaw would likely drive interest and cause more people to flock to it. I imagine the price would skyrocket. A black market would flourish. Barring strict capital controls, money would flow out of the country to legal exchanges over borders. With strict capital controls, bitcoins would be purchased in person, and spent in person. The value of the coin would be supported both by individuals who desire to protect their money and investment, and criminals who continue to use it for their transactions. Perhaps even a new virtual currency would emerge.
So how could it be stopped? If I were an angry despot, I would arrest everyone who had anything to do with it. I'd scan email records, confiscate computers. I'd shutdown miners, impose fines, confiscate goods acquired with bitcoin as being proceeds of crime. I'd use secret police tactics, pay informers to tell on people who use it. Bully people, basically.
Or I'd change the currency of my land back to a commodities based one, which would (mostly) make redundant a system like bitcoin for most people.

Nothing, and nothing. Not to mention that all the people who bought bitcoins at their all-time high and lost their money would be more than a little hesitant to buy the bitcoin2. Which is why IMO bitcoins are *safe*. Even *if* the government clamps down on them, shuts down exchanges, cracks down on businesses that accept them, etc., people can still trade them with each other privately, they will not lose their value. It is strangely comforting that we may also have drug cartels, mafia, etc, on our side. You know they are not going to give up the fight easily if it benifits them.

He makes a valid point, but I don't agree with everything... nevertheless, maintain a healthy skepsis and don't pour all your money into bitcoin. His article, however, isn't up to the usual high quality standard I expect from mises.org.
His valid point, IMO, is the competing cryptocurrencies. That always bothered me a bit, because it "cheapens" the bitcoin in a way. As for the rest of his points, his uneasiness seems based on the recent spike in value. That makes me a bit nervous too. But comparing bitcoins to the tulip craze or spikes during the dotcom boom is bit off base, because a company can be valued, whereas a currency? Who knows. It depends on its usefulness. If many people adopt bitcoins and use them, then the sky is the limit, otherwise, zero is the other limit. And "using" a currency can also mean storing wealth, not just spending.
Claiming that a currency is only useful if everyone can use it flies in the face of most currencies today. Most fiat currencies can only be used in their particular country of origin and do just fine.
