Yeah, somebody spent some serious cash.

Everybody is here because BTC just dropped $50 and MTgox has 20 minutes of lag.

Very cool read, thanks for sharing.

And smash the shit out of the printer as a sacrifice to the Bitcoin gods.

Congrats!  I honestly can't wait to read in the future about all the people that completely changed there life from being early adopters.  Exciting times for everybody.  I know there is a wide spectrum, but to know that a ton of college age students like me made a ton of money this last year being pioneers is really motivating for the future.

It will start around 110 Ithink, but it will drop extremely fast. MTGox is letting people cancel their orders right now, but I'm sure there are some people out there that forgot, or don't have access to a computer, or just aren't paying attention.  Those bids might still be up around 110ish range.  Unless everybody on MTgox cancelled all their bids, which I doubt.  So there will be a rush to sell at the peak then followed by some buying.  That is my guess!

You mention the verification queue and how those are all uninformed buyers.  That queue took over a week long when it was at 4,000.  Do you think those users, that are in line to buy coins, aren't researching the shit out of Bitcoin?  I feel safer because this window exists.  People are not giving in to immediate emotional investing.  They have that verification process to think, research, and decide again and again if they want to actually buy into Bitcoin.  There are those that are using cash and other sources to buy in nearly instantly, but I don't think you have a ton of blind buyers in those queues.  Thanks to that window, people are reading about Bitcoin for days before they can actually put their money in.  I strongly believe those users are using that time wisely, but obviously neither of us know what the truth is.

Get high and lay low.

Yup !  The smashing is less of a safety concern and more about the satisfaction of destroying the evil thing.

Pretty much at the same time of day for the last three days.  We hit a wall, and then we have one huge buyer push us over.

Land in Vermont?  I want it.  Couldn't find it on Craigslist or your site, do you happen to have the link still?    
Edit: I know I can't actually afford it, but I am curious.
