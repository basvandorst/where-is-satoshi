It went through with the price that I bought it. But there was a fee associated with it, like 1.5%.
There is another method that I just learned about that doesn't have the coinbase fees. If you go over to GDAX, you can sign in with your coinbase account and transfers between coinbase and GDAX are free. The difference with GDAX is that it makes you wait with a bank transfer (2-4 days) before you can purchase BTC. It might be worth it if you want to avoid the fee.

Deflation is an issue because of lack of trade. There's plenty of trade with BTC, so deflation isn't an issue. If you consider that BTC is really good with money laundering, then you'll understand.... governments can't compete with such a scheme.

There is not a deflation issue. The primary cause of deflation for anything is a drop in demand. In this case, the opposite has happened, there is increase in demand for bitcoin. The number of transactions has also increased.
Deflation isn't occurring, normalizing is occurring.

I just joined coinbase a couple of weeks ago. I purchased about 0.004 BTC. Coinbase held the BTC for nine days. During that time, the money was withdrawn from my bank account. After the holding period was over, the BTC was placed into my coinbase wallet and I can now transfer it.
Edit: It only took one day for coinbase to withdraw the money from my bank.

What I'm afraid of is a government getting a quantum computer and not telling anyone. Then they can break any SHA-256 hash with ease.  
The real issue I see is that, initially, only an entity with a lot of resources will have a quantum computer. Will that one computer be strong enough to gain more than 50% of total hashing power? I don't know the answer to that, but it does make me question the proof of work concept.

How so?

I think what you're saying is right on. However, the current financial login is protected by 2FA in my experience. I apologize for humanity if that is not the case.. 
For instance, if I want to login to Bank of America, I login and then I have to provide the authy passcode to sign in. If your bank isn't doing 2FA, then you should call them to make a change.
