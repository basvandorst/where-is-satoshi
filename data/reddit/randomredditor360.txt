Amazon's profit margins are ~0.5%
If they accept bitcoin, the would avoid the ~3% fees charged by credit card companies.   For purchases made via bitcoin, their profit margin goes from 0.5% to 3.5% -- 7X increase in this example.

btw, I really want to buy stuff on overstock. but I don't want to overpay.  I've looked at coffee grinders, power drill, clothes hangers -- random stuff that I need in the house, but amazon is &gt;10-20% cheaper (and I use gyft to get the additional 3%).  
What are some products that one should buy on overstock?

I've been to many gas stations across multiple states, and many offer a discount when you pay cash for gas.  So... is that illegal?

because you can use bitcoin to buy gyft value, and then buy on amazon by applying your gyft funds.  still good for btc ecosystem, but obviously not as good as buying on O directly

I want to get these folks to accept bitcoin! please send them a message!

what do folks think of neo bee, are there any good prospectus/ disclosure documents? do the founding team have any leadership experience?

How does gyft make money if they are receiving essentially $97 from a customer who can then purchase $100 worth of merchandise? 
I've been using them, and am wondering how they make money because I understand that cc cards charge 1.5-2.5%, so offering 3% to customers is great.  So we  must assume that amazon is paying MORE than 3% for online transactions via CC?

does buying gyft.com cards and using the gyft cards at places like Amazon "count" as "buy and replace"ing ?

how about giving them an option - btc in paper wallet that is ~$2 as a bonus tip (e.g., if they look into btc, it's a 20% tip, but if they don't, it's a 15% tip)  
So, btc paper wallet is a kicker tip rather than the base tip.

What are some products that are priced similarly or cheaper on overstock?

Maybe Hearn's lighthouse can create a platform which allows micro contributions to bail out other projects?

I'm going to wait for vimeo to accept bitcoin before watching rise and rise (or any film for that matter)   :)

how does price match work?

to spread awareness of btc, what do people think about tipping in real life (e.g., restaurants) by giving a paper wallet to folks? Say, carry paper wallets worth $5 each so that you can always give $5 of the overall tip in BTC, and the remaining in fiat

they should try distribution via yekra... and maybe try to get yekra to adopt payments by bitcoin, since their pay per view is on the single dollar transaction range

Netflix: you know we are always thinking of ways to upgrade our services so that our customers can enjoy Netflix---I did some checks for you just now and I must say that using Bitcoin sounds like a brilliant idea and if I have your permission I will most definitely go ahead now and pass this info over to my research team so they can look into getting this payment method implemented in the near future so that you can enjoy Netflix again. Is that okay with you?

what do people think about tipping in real life (e.g., restaurants) by giving a paper wallet to folks?  Say, carry paper wallets worth $5 each, and give $5 tip in btc + $x in fiat at dinners, etc...

very interesting growth trends, albeit absolute  are quite low considering these are trading values for an entire country
@_date: 2016-06-21 06:43:32
is it because if a country does not have any domestic miners, then the only way for them to get BTC is to buy from a party outside the country. but if the buyer can only pay in Nigerian currency, and the BTC seller is not in Nigeria, then there's no way the transaction can work.  is this the problem?
@_date: 2016-06-20 20:37:30
what are some ways to facilitate adoption / usage of bitcoin in countries like Nigeria? is it easy to buy bitcoin in Nigeria, just that they aren't interested or aware of bitcoin? or do many people want to buy bitcoin, but are unable to because no one wants the fiat that they can offer?
