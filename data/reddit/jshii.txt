And if you wanted to take it a step further, you can approach your wallet balance with a satoshi denomination (I'm not sure if there are many mobile wallets that can do that). Looking at your bitcoin holdings in Satoshis can be quite exciting.

I think the question should focus on assets as opposed to net worth. Net worth includes both assets and liabilities (a figure that can be negative). Also, depending on who you talk to, the assets of an investment portfolio may or may not be separate from hard, tangible assets.

I wanted to add a business here in Miami that accepts bitcoin, but the site wouldn't let me. I have tried to add this business on many different platforms (that show bitcoin-accepting business) but still have not been able to. We really need to work on that if adoption is going to increase.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but when I heard someone from Bitsquare being interviewed on some podcast the other day, they had mentioned that there is a way for users to provide liquidity in exchange for receiving dividends in the form of Bitsquare shares. Can anyone confirm this? I downloaded the application, but couldn't find anything like that there.

I think using BTC for compensation should at least be a continuous option for liquidity providers.
