Gotta mine with outdated hardware its the truth.
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:16:50
I could tell this was going to be a positive outlook by the upvotes
@_date: 2013-12-15 08:02:57


Because this subreddit only upvotes positive news. I put in a buy order when it was at $1045 on my local exchange. It's 1 from the top right now. I've been buying at regular intervals, not by price at all. This bid was more of a 'how long until this goes through' thing. I expected to wait until January

Your level headed reasoning is not welcomed here
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:57:54
The spread is nasty and people charge a premium for the conversion. Depositing coins is complex and potentially expensive depending on the method you use. I had to convert CAD--&gt;USD to get BTC. $$ lost there. Its a long way off of being a truly useable currency

Peter Schiff surprised me. I got into ~~Bitcoin~~ cyrptocurrencies  for all the reasons he promotes gold

Do we think she is there of her own interest? But this image raises an interesting point:
Is this an example of if people *outside* of the young technically inclined male demographic will adopt bitcoin? Or is it more like when IM software like ICQ was just a nerd thing until it all exploded?
Interesting times people.
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:44:31
Akin to gold. Still spendable, but used more as a store of value.

It's "investing" armature hour. It's not even speculation right now, its fucking gambling. The Tech Analysis guys right now are laughing their dick off all the way to retirement

BTC is not dominated by women in the real or in the world of academic theory. Real talk: I'll believe Bitcoin has been adopted when my mother, sister, or niece talks about it unprompted. Until then it's a male dominated niche with potential.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:15:40
They don't get it. Everyone is hoarding coins hoping *others* will adopt and spend.

Bitcoin Friday, the biggest consumer transaction period in the history of bitcoin, was 10% of network traffic. That's on its best day ever.

There are tons of girls! See? They dance for money!
Fawkesy is famous in Bitcoin community because she is simply a girl. It is a skockingly skewed demographic, even compared to the average reddit
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:33:54
$250 is still good news. A good entry point, people that believe in it is a currency (as opposed to a get rich quick scheme) can buy in and not feel like they missed the boat.
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:59:16
@_date: 2013-12-15 08:06:53
Totally agree. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:35:15
Old people are the litmus test though. Once all of the (forseeable) bugs are ironed out of Bitcoin... Will my mother use it? If the answer is yes, get in now. If no... consider alternates.
Or wait until the old people die
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:18:46
I'm sure they will!

And funnily enough, Amazon itself is drastically overvalued in the eyes of many investors.
@_date: 2013-12-06 07:35:29
Pointing out that the lions share of BTC transactions is on currency speculation and not being used in trade for goods and services is not venting negativity, its providing perspective.  Everyone is hoarding coins in the hope that everyone *else* will spend BTC and make it a legitimate and supported currency. 
Pointing out legitimate concerns? I'm *such* a downer.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:19:11
Prove me wrong brah

Cant downvote truth. Go with Christ.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:14:16
Pretty much spot on for me as well. I don't like much volatility in my paycheck. If I was paid in BTC converted from fiat, its too limited a currency for day to day purchases and bills. If I were paid in flat BTC unconverted... I might be a millionaire next year or a beggar
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:15:36
Awesome info, thanks!

To put BTC into obscurity, it would take enough bad news and events to make YOU PERSONALLY loose faith in BTC. So I guess... hope for a 51% attack?
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:26:43
Both people sound kinda douchey
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:34:25
Well that guy... He was going to lose his sister anyways
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:43:02
I'm interested in many aspect of bitcoin. As an investment, you have to ignore the buzz and emotion. Level-headed *unbiased* information is crucial. would do well to take a page out of 's book.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:41:47
I feel it is in everyone's best interest to not let emotion drive financial decisions. The housing bubble had exactly the same issue: Everyone with a house was doubling their money, if you don't get in now you'll be left behind etc.
Asking when a good time to buy BTC is like asking a Real Estate agent if now is a good time to buy.
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:51:35
the fuck is this?
@_date: 2013-12-15 09:38:27
Ok, now that is cool.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:58:09
Cease further contact, and get a lawyer.
@_date: 2013-12-06 07:39:46
Everyone is so swept up in the excitement that I don't think there is much of a chance of that. Don't believe me? Click the 'controversial' tab of Anything other than positive BTC news is downvoted.
Too much good news feels like a pump and dump to me.
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:59:47
Gonna take some regulation, legislation, or some *real* legal accountability before that happens. If the fiat banking system was run as off the hip as exchanges were, there would be a riot. 
inb4 Bailout, ponzi, reserve currency, banker bonuses
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:42:47
For BTC to become mainstream the exchanges need to sort out some pretty large issues. I like volatility in the market, not the institution I'm making trades with.
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:14:46
**Min** $10k? You should put everything you have into Bitcoin right this second. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:31:58
As if the volatility of Bitcoin itself wasn't enough
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:11:08
More and more I'm considering BTC to be an asset. As a currency it's not got many of the features I like. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:23:04
Pay a lawyer to write that letter. Not that expensive (&lt;50GBP), VERY effective.

Buying at a discount? Or catching a falling knife. People are getting a crash course in daytrading today. Investors call it 'Paying tuition'.
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:40:29
Too much circlejerking from a bunch of people hoarding coins and speculating in the hope it will go up. is a terrible place to get anything other than Bullish conversation on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-15 18:18:07
Adoption is crucial. Otherwise it's just like Linden dollars or WOW gold: A niche currency for a niche demographic
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:44:58
I like you. A reasonable course of action in a den of people hoping they can retire on short-term speculation.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:53:18
That reads like someone who comes knocking at my door at 9am on a Sunday.
Yes, there is a lot of potential, its why I'm here.


upvotes the good news, downvotes the negative. 'The whole' is overwhelmingly biased.


Beware the confirmation bias.
