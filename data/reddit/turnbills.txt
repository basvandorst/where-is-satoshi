Ya took a few days my current gpu sucks
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:32:08
I'm still mining away with them with my shitbox gpu so I'm at .0009 and some, so it'll be awhile before I make it to payout lol. But it doesn't seem like I'm missing any?
Maybe I got lucky?

Horrible advice.

Don't fuck with the IRS indeed. I'm from Canada and I still know better than to fuck with the IRS. Those fuckers are ruthless.

It isn't back by nothing. It is backed by the people who believe in it, and that is worth whatever they're willing to pay for it. 
If people are willing to pay $25k for a metal ring with a shiny rock on it and believe that it's worth $25k, then that ring is worth $25k. Nevermind the fact that they couldn't turn around and sell it for even $15k a day later. 
I think you'd benefit from learning some basic economics, as well as computer science

Amazing my dude. All cryptos could crash and burn, everything could come tumbling down but the people you help with this will forever have better lives because of it. 
You could have kept this for yourself and all your friends and family but you chose to do this and it's very admirable. 
As far as charities go, I donate to a few big name ones like Amnesty and Care, however I have heard that there have been some tremendously positive results from small, local level grassroots approaches to teaching vulnerable young children in bad areas everything from basic education to how to treat and help one another. I'm guessing you won't have to work anymore so if ever you want to get directly involved in some of this stuff I highly recommend you consider setting up something similar yourself! 
If it's something you want to do a year or two down the line, I will even take a half year to a year off work (wouldn't have to quit my job) to volunteer/help you set it up. 
I wish all the best to you and to all those you will help with this. Thank you so much

Damn, true. Well that's unfortunate but at least it wasnt much I guess

Bitcoin à-la-king
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:32:38
I was able to transfer my bitcoin out a couple days ago but no such luck with my litecoin

The real gift that keeps on giving

To be fair, if Bitcoin hasn't been used for money laundering I would eat my own toe. So I wouldn't necessarily say he is "falsely condemning bitcoin". It's just a lot more than a money laundering tool and obviously big banks do that shit all the time. What was that big bank in the UK that got exposed a year or two ago for hundreds of millions related to organized crime? Deutsche Bank? Did anyone go to jail?

I'm not going to comment on your relationship situation but I will say from a tax perspective, given you incomes (and depending on where you live) it would make the most sense to only cash it out slowly in small amounts per calendar year if you live somewhere with a graduated income tax system like I do (where income over x pays more tax and so on). 
I would consider going back to school for both of you. If you lived like slightly-better-than-poor students you wouldn't have to take much out to fund that lifestyle and then once you've both graduated (I would highly suggest doing something with a co-op program) you'll both probably have better jobs. Maybe at that point buy a house? Who knows where BTC will be by then.
But education is worth it, investing in your brain and your wife's brain is a worthwhile investment, and if everything goes to shit you'll both still have a better shot at a good job than you do now. 
That or you could disappear off the grid somewhere in south America and build a small compound with solar power and grow your own stuff/raise some cool animals and spend money on vacations., that's probably what I would do with 1.8 Million but hey, you do you. 
It's worth mentioning that even at 5% annual interest you'd be making nearly 100k which is more than you two make currently so you could probably live off the interest and do whatever the fuck you want.

Can you explain your process a little more? Are you mining alts? How do you go about it? What kind of hardware do you use if you do?
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:58:54
I really hope so. Setting up on exchanges and paying their constant fees has really started to piss me off and I'm still pretty new here...
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:17:42
Pretty sure the idea is that other people will also be willing to chip in. I don't even have .1 btc so count me out on that though lol
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:39:30
Almost 12k now holy fuck
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:45:32
Jesus $15 for the merry 10k bitcoin socks, that's annoying. And $60 for the hoodie? Is those are usd (and not cad based on my location) that's just ridiculous
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:38:03
Have been considering doing the same.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:17:30
It bothers me so much knowing about these things now, as I used to live in an apartment (rental) and the electricity was tied into the condo fees that were paid by everybody. So not me, nor my landlord would have to pay for higher electricity and the overall impact of me doing it in a building with 30 floors and 9x2-3 bedrooms per floor wouldn't be noticeable enough for the condo board to care (unless I went HEAVY into it). 
Not having to factor in the cost of electricity into mining would make it very, very interesting. 
EDIT: I'd be pretty interesting in knowing what kind of hardware you're fuckin' with

And these guys are based out of Hong Kong? I'm not super familiar with their government agencies but wouldn't their equivalent of the IRS be getting hardons right now hoping to expose a massive fraud like that? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:49:26
I see what you mean, cool
