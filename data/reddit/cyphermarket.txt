You can login via your qr? I didn't know that, that awesome! 
My main idea with the square analogy was using smartphones and tablets to transact via the coinkite access card to get the benefit of swift transactions w zero confirmations for businesses or individuals that may not need a whole terminal. Maybe I'm just thinking too short term though...

That's funny, because I don't do any legal or illegal drugs, including alcohol. The only glaring exception is the Monday morning coffee. What I do do, however, is wish for solutions to unnecessary problems caused by governments and power-hungry aristocrats.
How do we fix the problems in this world? I want those answers. I want to know I tried my hardest in making life easier and more pleasant for everyone. Equality, morality, individuality. Those are my goals. Are your goals to troll? Then go for it.
At least I choose to try.

Make this into a poster or print! I'd buy one of these with btc immediately!

Coinbase allows individuals to withdraw to their individual bank accounts (takes around 5 business days).
Currently, these businesses are hauling tens of thousands of physical dollars to deposit in personal accounts, and the accounts are well-known. Instead, they could send the bitcoins to individual coinbase accounts and withdraw there if they choose to. Banks haven't been seen closing accounts for accepting USD from Coinbase, they only get wary when people send USD to Coinbase for bitcoin. 
Even if this still poses the risk of the banks shutting them down, it's much better than hauling dangerous levels of cash around, switching cars, and paying someone to count and sort cash for hours.

Things like this made me wish I had gone to school for computer science, but all I've got is a love for and a degree in Political Science and the typical office job... if only there were freelance jobs for that!

Loved it! Honestly, a great sketch by CH.

Exactly. Honestly, if I had the cash, I'd go to Colorado myself and setup a well-placed bitcoin ATM and charge a measly .5% or 1% fee and then buy tablets and setup coinbase accounts for the merchants. I'd explain to them if they gave a simple 2% discount for bitcoin transactions, they would save a significant amount in time and risk by having such less in physical cash. The merchant would be happy, and it'd be net cheaper for repeat customers, and it would be much more secure long-term, seeing that bitcoin cannot be frozen of siezed by the feds.
There are millions of dollars in just two weeks going to these dispensaries... that's a lot of money a bitcoin businessman could tap into.

Place a tablet or Coinkite terminal in each business. Encourage use of bitcoin over cash with a discount, aimed namely at repeat customers. Eventually, the banks will shut down their personal accounts or the feds will freeze the accounts and seize the money. Coinbase, Coinkite, hell any paid or free wallet service has a chance here to give a good pitch here. A bitcoin atm can even be nearby, run by a savvy and smart guy. Then the risk of cash is incredibly reduced, to only an atm... and there are plenty of security companies that can handle that.

It's happening!!

I'm tempted to go to Colorado, setup a well-placed Bitcoin ATM near a hub of dispensaries, then go to willing dispensaries and lend them tablets hooked up to Coinbase, and convince them to give a paltry 1% or 2% discount to repeat customers who use Bitcoin, seeing that it would reduce their physical-cash risks, time spent sorting through money, would save on inherent security, and would save them from risks dealing with feds freezing or seizing accounts.
These businesses could pay willing employees in bitcoin. Banks don't have any history in not accepting USD from Coinbase. They only get suspicious when people send USD from banks to the bitcoin network. Best of all, NONE of it is illegal, and it would insulate banks from saying publically they accept drug money. They don't.

I live in New Orleans and would LOVE to help sell your terminal as a side venture on the weekends! I secretly hoped you'd be at the Texas BTC Conference in March just so I could offer my labor haha

I listen to LTB everytime it comes out on my drives to and from work. I find myself absorbing every episode and scouring the web for more audio, more video, more information. Thanks so much for your hard work Adam!

Just ordered a card with you guys! Do you guys ever plan to have an actual mobile app, instead of just using the web? The only thing that disappointed me on your online wallet was no ability to scan qr codes with your camera, you had to type them in. I also love blockchains watch-only feature. 
If you guys EVER made a card reader for a smartphone. Similar to square, I'd buy one instantaneously!!!!

Why doesn't Coinbase or Coinkite go to every single of of these businesses and offer to help? Coinkite could subsidize their terminals to the businesses and in return, the businesses could encourage (for a minor discount) their frequent customers to get their coinkite cards. Coinbase could easily offer their services. If these businesses even mildly pushed bitcoin IN ORDER TO DECREASE THEIR CASH ON HAND (a major, major, major safety risk), why the hell not?!

Yeah I keep almost all of my coins on paper wallets printed by a machine that never touches the internet, and I make 3 copies of those wallets: one at home in a fire safe, one in a safe deposit box, and one at a trusted friends house in his gun safe. My wallets are encrypted with a secure but memorable password. My hot wallet coins are on coinkite, blockchain, or in my bersa wallet. All encrypted with double passwords and 2-factor google authentication. It's pretty easy to manage, actually, with minimal risk!

With the average mining fee for transactions, since fees aren't floating yet, aren't micro-transactions realistically unfeasible in Bitcoin at this moment? 
The core developers really need to get these floating rates implemented and also solve some of the scaling problems, because every week more and more businesses are hopping on!

Sorry for the late questions:
1) How are Vero cards different than any other paper-wallet-card storage methods? Am I misinterpreting that the inherent difference is that a verso card's private key can be scanned repeatedly, making the card reusable in a secure way, because the private key is never transmitted outside of the app, or am I wrong?
2) are we able to buy two verso silver cards with the exact same addresses, effectively giving us a physical backup, especially since gold isn't available yet?

I would LOVE to try you guys out! Got a location right at the corner and I've been dying for an announcement for months

I wonder how many times they've been asked that. Surely more than once!
