Hi Could you please provide an update on the status of the review of applications and the possibility of supporting new charities? :)
I see that most donations have been quite significant and to established charities, which admittedly makes sense and is worthy, but I've noted that you were "also exploring spin-off projects such as ‘PF Ventures’ for passionate people to start their own charities, and those would come with milestone-based grants." (
In light of Bitcoin's current loss of value, it would seem like a good time for making smaller donations to new projects that are "bold and smart bets that hopefully impact everyone in our world" (pineapplefund.org). Then, if or when Bitcoin goes up, satisfying initiatives could be further supported with larger donations.
I had thought this post was about PF Ventures upcoming until I read it was about an already established project.
Just a thought and question. Congratulations for your time spent in reviewing applications and for your selection of great charities!

The news refers to 1,400,000 point-of-sale devices in Brazil. 1 Brazilian Real equals 0.24 United States Dollar. 
Brazil's neighbor, Venezuela, has a currency that went from 60 bolivars per dollar to 25,000 per dollar over the last year, after having taken off 5 zeros in August 2018.

Yes, it looks like a custodial account with CriptoHub that deducts your BTC balance for payment to the point-of-sale's payment processor Cielo with banking partners.

It looks like a custodial account with CriptoHub in which you have a BTC balance, not your own wallet with private key.

The Lightning Network once with a better user experience is meant to compete with that.
