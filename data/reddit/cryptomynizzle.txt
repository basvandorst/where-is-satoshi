Central banks control the money supply.   All they have to do is "print" 1 trillion dollars and they could buy every Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple and every other crypto coin currently known.   They can invent money supply and before we (the public) get the memo they'd hold all the crypto.
The longer they wait to execute this strategy the more unlikely it becomes.  
Another way is to tear down the original purpose and intent of bitcoin and other leading alt coins by infiltrating their core dev teams.  They did this already in major tech circles and it is why major security algos have back doors.   Some might argue this segwit2x fiasco is a variety of this very pattern.

bitcoincash is NOT suffering.  It is &lt;2 months old and I'm watching adoption up, wallets up, exchanges up.... most importantly interest, devs, and participants in making bitcoinCash happen is up.
Hashrate drama is expected with SW1 / SW2 event upcoming.
BitcoinCash is the winning bitcoin.

You're either poorly informed or a liar.  
The # of business accepting it grows daily.  
It has been out 2 months.   
You're on the wrong side of the coin.   
"The only reason the market cap seems to be at large at it is, is because the vast majority of bitcoin users never even bothered touching their BCH. "
Just a bullshit statement you have no data to back up.
"The entire market cap is an illusion."
Blah blah blah. 
BTC is the alt once it took the hit from the segwit pipe. 
Bye bye btc.   Wall street jokers and ma and pas will still get sucked in on the hype -- but it's a dead man walking.
Core is exposed.  Blockstream is exposed.   NYA will expose it further and destroy its hashrate.
BITCOINCASH is the real bitcoin.

Forks are an expected part bitcoin.  
"The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it" - Satoshi Nakamoto
We determine true bitcoin by using the chain.  If one is fake, or inferiro, be it segwit1x, segwit2x, bitcoinCash -- then it will die off and lose value/interest/use.

wrong.  Still over 1E.   
Loving it.  
Shitcoin = segwit1x + side chains.   How does it feel to be in bed with Adam Back, Sampson Mow and Gregory Maxwell....   LLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLZZZZZZZZZZZZ
Enjoy your seggy ALT cuz it is on borrowed time.

Your bitcoin segwit lightning chain is the impostor!  1x, 2x, 4x 8x.  U name it.  Impostor.  Ur btc was hijacked and converted into an ALT -- the saving hard fork preserved the true bitcoin..
Bitcoin Cash is bitcoin and you watch how fast innovation continues to happen .. it is already flooding in.   The decentralized dev is unshackled from the emotional drama of the cypherPunks and the overlords of blockstream pushing their own agenda and path.
BITCOIN CASH WINS.

not sure where you pulled this out of.  
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:44:50
you jackholes are demonstrating precisely why BitcoinCash has already won.  BitcoinCash is bitcoin -- the rest of you jokers are alts on borrowed time.

hashrate 3E right now.   "yuge".

I believe you underestimate what central govts already print (paper or electronic).  It makes all of crypto look like a candy bar purchase at 7-11.

2 months in, bro.
patience young padawan.  patience.

Some TA chart theory works best in non-emerging markets that are not gaining new interest daily.  That's a common mistake I've watched "analysts" make against crypto for years.   Bollinger does it by predicting triple tops --- and then BTC proceeds to shatter the triple top with a new wave of buying interest that wasn't even in the mix on the previous wave.
The bigger concern at the present time for BTC shouldn't be an ATH.   There are legitimate concerns about the tech and BCH for all intents and purposes IS THE BETTER BITCOIN.  It has solved the problem(s) and kept the solution on chain.   It has its own challenges but they are miner (pun intended) compared to 1mb blocks, segwit2x offchaining "fix", high transaction times and fees that prevent it from being ACTUALLY being used mainstream.  No more drama.  BCH is sitting there as a viable coin and some at this point believe it to be the more "bitcoin" bitcoin after BTC has 'lost its original way'.   
The recent LTC rally may be for similar reasons.
IF THIS is TRUE (please note the if) ... the whales just may pump BTC -- get all the ma and pops on board -- get the johnny-come-late wannabe crypto whales --- get all the squak box shows pumping BTC like granny selling gold on tv at night --- while they accumulate the BCH coin.  In this scenario they can influence BCH as the winner.   It makes for an interesting opportunity in the realm of the whales.    In this scenario, BTC could be used in a whale vs whale epic battle that creates the most heavily filled bags crypto has ever seen.   
IF you could make BCH the "real bitcoin" then accumulating BCH at 600/coin is alot more lucrative than paying 5k.

How many stock/options do you have in blockstream and/or blockstream related/connected companies.  
In no way do I believe you are obligated to divulge this info.    
I am curious.  It would help fill in some gaps on my analysis.
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:07:08
Anyone can pick up bitcoin for 415/coin right now.
BitcoinCash is bitcoin.

Bitcoin cash wins.  It is bitcoin.  This is just a matter of WHEN it is obvious to the different classes of crypto players.    The General Public doesn't have to know why.  They'll find their way to the winner, eventually, usually long after the battle is waged and settled.

gizzzy keeps changing the argument --- this data fluctuates with time.. 
Speaking of time... tick tock, bitches.
Segwit2x is going to RAPE your shitcoin of all her power and leave her cold and abandoned only to be HODL'd by 'true' believers (brainwashed, stubborn bitcoinCore cypherPosers).

Good thing there are so many words ending in izzy in this english language otherwise it would be much more difficult to rap.

With respect to BTC only:   16,537,325 BTC are out.   That isn't a big number.  Based on volume data, on any given day about 2-3% of all BTC are exchanged.    I agree, the price would rise in a "Hunt" like silver buyout play.   It probably is unlikely.  However, the fed doesn't care about their "value" -- they bought up trillions of bad paper during the last financial crisis.  This wouldn't be as costly.   They want controlling ownership.   He who owns the most BTC controls the strongest hand in the direction of BTC.
