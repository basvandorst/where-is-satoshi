gdax is wild to look at. I've never bought through Bitstamp or coinbase (am in Aus) but I'm just used to this chart [chart]( to keep score when there's some action. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:55:30
If it were illegal in my country I wouldn't have much use for it. It would be difficult to acquire so there would be overpriced then there would be very few people to trade with so it would limit what I could buy. Sure I could send it overseas, but I can already use PayPal or a credit card which has consumer protection built in and is actually cheaper atm in most scenarios. 
Moreover, it is very easy for a gov agency to trace BTC and if they wanted to crack down on people they could go after them hard. Good luck trying to prove you're not funding criminal activities or terrorism. 
The legal ramifications of getting drunk during the prohibition era are tame in comparison. Thus the analogy falls on it's arse.

I mean over priced to initially buy, like all things that are illegal.
And yes it is not hard to trace bitcoin through the blockchain. If it were illegal to own and carried heavy penalties you would certainly want to be very careful about where you got it from and where you are sending it. It would not be worth it for most people, hence the ponzi scheme would collapse.

Granted bitcoin is not exactly the same as traditional Ponzi scheme, but it does share some of the characteristics. Of course I was using some hyperbole, but it's funny how defensively crypto enthusiasts react to the word 'ponzi'. It indicates that they realise there is an element of truth in the comparison but no not want to admit it. 
Even though there are coins that are more private than bitcoin, there are few if any legitimate uses that fiat can't fulfill. If they are illegal then it would only make sense to use them for other illegal activities. Cryptos would not be successful if their use was limited to illegal activity. They would not be widely used; the cost of purchase would be high relative to their trading value which would also be highly volatile.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:42:24
It looks like it might go sideways for a while. I should try to do the same. It's nearly 3am and I had way too much excitement for one night;)
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:25:12
I have mixed feelings on the matter. I agree with you that strong political leanings one way or the other may turn away people from the other side and hinder adoption. However people still use fiat regardless of their political persuasions, so I don't see why bitcoin should be any different in principal. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:46:55
WTF are you on about? You're obviously a BTC shill in full damage control mode. Good luck with that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:39:51
haha, yeah it's hectic. What chart are you looking at? I'm just watching bitstamp and bitfinex on bitcoinwisom. There is a 2k btc buywall at ~$11k on Bitstamp. Looks like it going to test it. 
I think it will go down more over the short term. This whole run up over the last few months was ridiculous, imo. No real good reason for it at all. Looks like a massive pump and dump/market manipulation. I'm not confident to predict what it'll do. I'm sitting out. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:05:51
The point is wide spread adoption won't happen if it is illegal. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:53:29
Bitcoin has always been closely associated with libertarian politics which is in favour of personal freedom. I personally don't see the problem with that being associated with bitcoin. I do however have a problem with authoritarianism in bitcoin, and of course that exists on both sides of the political spectrum.

They are. That's why it keeps dropping. It won't go back up until everybody stops selling and starts buying.

How safe is it when the price could plummet at any moment?
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:35:38
First up, I don't want cryptos to be criminalised or over regulated, but if they are then there is no benefit for most people to continue using them instead fiat (imo). The few that do continue to use illegal bitcoin would likely into other criminal activity so there would be few people to do any legitimate trade with using cryptos. 
I get that they are great for international payments and that is one of the things that firs interested me about the tech. It opens up a lot of opportunity for people. I hope that cryptos survive in the long run without laws that cripple them. But people need to be realistic about threats to bitcoin instead of sticking their head in the sand and shouting "moon".  
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:34:16


That is sickening. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:56:13
I believe it is fungible for the most part. However it isn't fungible when coins can be traceable or tainted with coins that are linked to illegal activity. For instance coins that were obtained through hacking exchanges will not be easily able to be sold on exchanges or traded and will therefore be valued less than the market rate.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:36:55
You'd accept the currency of the country in which you reside. It's not that hard. Why bother accepting BTC if you can only exchange it for goods and services among the other fringe dwellers who accept it?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:05:33
Fair point, but why not just exchange goods and services for fiat? What additional benefit is there to BTC in this use case?

From what I understand, all coins remain in the block chain and are never actually lost. But control of them can be, for example your computer explodes and you can't access you wallet. 
If the coins were actually stolen, then Gox does not control them, the thief does. Assuming the 750k coins were stolen, they may have already been sold, or they may be sold in the future. Or the thief could be caught, but that seems unlikely.

I'm happy with 0.2%, and I feel safer knowing that exchanges are making enough profit to reduce the incentive to steal the held funds and coins.

Might be alright for btc to fiat arbitrage

The joke is so fitting that it seems contrived.

So are all of the coins in that wall are controlled by one bot?
@_date: 2014-02-27 10:20:44
Interesting take on the fiasco. I'm sure that when/ if its finally revealed, the 'truth' is going to feel like a disappointing finale  compared to some of the speculative explanations.

Thanks for the reply.

China should just get out of cryptos. They ruin it for the rest of the world.

I'm all for cryptos, but if I had to go through so much trouble to secure my holdings, I'd rather just use a bank.

I don't know whether to invest in the shirts and put them in cold storage for a year or two, or to invest in printing gear before the difficulty goes up. 
I missed my free lunch with Bitcoin, I don't want to make the same mistake again.

I do feel sorry for him as a fellow human being. But he has hurt a lot of people and the bitcoin economy. 
I don't wish him any misfortune, but I urge him to make a statement to clarify this messy situation.

If you take a look you will see that Gox is no longer displayed along the top with the other exchanges. It is also greyed out in the markets menu.
@_date: 2014-03-12 10:22:47
I would pay for things with Bitcoin, but I'm down on my initial investment. Psychologically, it makes it hard to spend rather than wait until at least breaking even.

Bitcoin would be ideal payment for porn, no more explaining strange credit card payments to the missus.

Screw paying for that with BTC, I wouldn't even wast my bandwidth downloading the song off TPB.

This reminds me of the fact that we are all still early adopters:)

Litecoin tends to be more volatile than Bitcoin. If Bitcoin loses significant value, Litecoin will often lose more value at a faster rate in percentage terms, but it usually recovers faster.

I don't have much BTC, I bought at a high price and haven't yet realized any great profit from it. I would gladly donate some BTC to Wiki, but be damned if I'll pay by any other method.
@_date: 2013-12-02 10:24:19
Thanks for the lulz. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:45:10
I don't really see is as good news. I may be wrong, but it seems like the equivalent of the US denying the possibility of institutional investments such as the Winklevoss EFT and Second Market. Much of the current BTC price is based upon the speculation of future institutional investments.  
@_date: 2013-12-02 10:05:49
Congratulations on your achievement. Spread the good word:)  
@_date: 2013-12-04 11:56:17
That's all well and good (for Bitpay), but we need to promote wider acceptance of Bitcoin as a valid form of currency. 
I would donate Bitcoin to Wiki if the option was available, but I would not do it through Bitpay.

I know how you feel OP. I am anti gambling, but I have basically been seduced by day trading (without much success). Cognitive dissonance all the way.
