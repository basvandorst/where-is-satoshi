we need to quit petitioning the Bitcoin foundation to change and instead form another organization that isn't messed up.

+100 doge verify. nail on the head. dogecoin is the friendly way to learn how to use cryptos.  I use them both and can't understand why there is any hate on one side or the other as they truly have a symbiotic relationship.

They have a lawyer. That's me. I'm taking care of it along with an engineer and another lawyer and then there are all the other incredible but quiet Sean's Outpost employees, volunteers, and warriors. So. We got it covered while he makes his trek to make Sean's outpost and help for the homeless a permanent fixture. So there's that.

anyone who pays attention knew not to have money at Gox for quite a long time now.  It is good because now gox will really go away and those new adopters, the majority of the people, will have one less shady company to deal with.  That is good that shady companies are getting weeded out.  It is bad and really sucks though for the people who lost their money to these criminals.

of course. but that's their fault.

people are scared of new paradigms. can you imagine what people thought when they believed the world was flat and they were starting to be told that, in fact, it was round and you can't fall off of it?

I wasn't aware I had to present a doctoral candidate thesis in a reddit comment. My comment is highly simplified because it is just a comment on a reddit thread. I don't purport to have a PHD in political and economic science, but thanks for letting me and the rest of reddit know that you think we are idiots.

Because modern government's base their power off of their economies (primarily) and because they have adopted monetary systems which form the lifeblood of those economies, if bitcoin catches on, then it stands to reason that money such as bitcoin can = freedom. This is because the centralized power structures who control the monetary system and thus dictate what is benefitted and what is penalized lose the power to benefit and/or penalize people or entities because those institutions no longer control the monetary system. Rather, with bitcoin the users (all economic participants) "control" the system "equally."

such is the nature of complex systems and their eventual diminishing returns spent on simply attempting to maintain their own complexity.
@_date: 2014-01-27 17:11:10
I completely agree.

Grateful.  There is nothing wrong with doge other than it's fun.  If fun is bad then doge = evil.

for storing purposes alone, coinkite is good as well.  Plus, you can store litecoin there as well. Though cold storage is probably better for long term storage.

Exactly. Never, never, never talk to the police without a lawyer. Police are never there to be your friend or understand your point of view, they're there to find people to charge with crimes.  Go hire a lawyer right now.

Coinbase is a PITA to use and they have no customer service. I'm hopeful they'll get their issues sorted out soon.
