We have a funny definition of stable in the Bitcoin world.
@_date: 2013-10-18 00:08:49
Hmm... OK thanks. It's a bit strange though. I would assume that most people who have hundred of thousands of dollars keep the money in some form of investment (stocks, bonds, whatever) and only liquidate when necessary (i.e., right before a major purchase). From your post it seems like that would be considered suspicious behavior.
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:46:58
Clearly not any US bank. Some of them refuse to deal with Bitcoin-currency exchanges. Can you suggest one that you know works?
@_date: 2013-10-17 23:03:34
Ah, thanks for the heads up. Exactly the kind of warning I was looking for.
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:56:29
No. That's not how it works. You are misunderstanding the situation.
@_date: 2013-10-17 20:13:32
I don't really understand. Don't a LOT of people conduct business (or buy houses or boats, etc.) with large transfers of capital? What am I missing here?
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:09:19
That would be awesome, but I am not going to count on it :)
@_date: 2013-10-22 21:27:09
Good job... although it kind of indicates a sudden switch rather than a gradual handover... still, much better than it was.
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:28:22
WHAT BANK DO YOU USE IN THE US?!?!
That is at least half of the problem here. I understand that Bitstamp is great, but not all banks in the US are friendly to receiving wire transfers from Bitstamp.
@_date: 2013-10-21 03:50:12
Hold on to them for 10 years. Store them safely.
@_date: 2013-10-17 23:15:33
Seems like I might be pioneering some new ground here... I'll report back (in a few months) of what I learned going through this process.
@_date: 2013-10-17 23:16:12
Don't want to be too revealing. Can you say why it matters what state the house is in?
@_date: 2013-10-23 01:21:41
That's awesome!
@_date: 2013-10-22 17:08:48
Have you done this with an American bank? Can you share which one it was?
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:52:57
That's not even slightly true. Bitcoin can easily scale to thousands of transactions per second,
@_date: 2013-10-19 05:20:35
Hardware wallets. Check out "trezor"... they even have a video with a "mom" or "grandma" in it!
@_date: 2013-10-22 18:34:34
Well said.
@_date: 2013-10-19 14:34:25
Um, wow? I knew this was possible... but easy? I hope this really takes off.
@_date: 2013-10-22 17:23:14
Yes, I am seriously considering it. I looked at Amagi metals. They charge a 1% processing fee and I am not sure what the shipping costs are.
The thing about the gold strategy is that it will take some small amount of time and some small amount of fees, which is fine, but it seems comparable to the time/fees used to slowly withdraw bitcoins from Coinbase or anywhere else. The hard part, it seems, is doing a "large" wire transfer.
@_date: 2013-10-21 17:17:42
Suggestions from Coinbase reps would be great!
@_date: 2013-10-17 23:14:02
Also, since you're a lender, can you give any advice on what I should show regarding the sale of bitcoins? What would be the most transparent, above-board, no-fuss, documentation to provide?
@_date: 2013-10-24 20:52:46
Wow, this is a good one for the scrapbook of poor predictions!
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:46:08
I'm not worried about fee/charges. I am only worried about banks that don't like bitstamp. Can I ask what bank you use?
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:04:30
What is a good bank to deposit into from CampBX?
@_date: 2013-10-21 15:34:05
In the sense that they are competitors (which can be debated), Bitcoin has the major advantage of being inherently international. I think Square, Clinkle, and LevelUp are going to have a very hard time getting out of the US.
@_date: 2013-10-23 00:33:23
@_date: 2013-10-17 23:12:00
Hmm, I'm confused by what you're saying. What do you mean you don't care if the money was just sitting there? You mean if it was sitting there for 2+ years? You seem to be saying that if the money was "just sitting" there since a few weeks ago, then that would be a problem. Could you clarify?
@_date: 2013-10-22 16:40:04
That other person was me and I am in the same situation. Right now I am looking into creating an account at the Internet Credit Union (IAFCU). 
I have also asked CampBX what their ACH transfer limit is (which is just a small piece of this puzzle) but haven't gotten a response yet.
@_date: 2013-10-22 14:49:52
Your post reminds me of this:
@_date: 2013-10-21 20:00:58
Your answer is not helpful. What you are not realizing is that it is easy to get the 100% "no, you can't use us for bitcoin-related deposits" by talking to your bank, but it is time consuming to find other banks that might say yes. Therefore, if someone in the community has had a good experience, it would help the rest of us to share the details. We would still need to talk to the bank to make sure, of course, but it would cut down a lot on wasted conversations.
@_date: 2013-10-21 17:16:39
Please upvote my comment for visibility. I too would like to know this... but the question is really two questions. Which is the best source (Bitstamp, CampBX, Coinbase, etc.) and which is the best target (Chase, Bank of America, Silicon Valley Bank, some credit union, etc.)
A lot of us really need to know the answer to this. So if you have had a good experience PLEASE SHARE the details!
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:17:58
@_date: 2013-10-22 21:20:53
Yeah, that's just incorrect. I wouldn't get angry about it, just fix it and politely explain the inaccuracy. Shorter explanations are better.
@_date: 2013-10-23 21:07:26
Increasing the blocksize is almost a certainty at this point, it has broad approval. It does not defeat the point AT ALL to have a small(er) number of nodes.
Is gold "centralized"... no. Are there millions of companies mining gold? No. There are a handful, but anyone can do it. It doesn't defeat the point of Bitcoin to have hundreds, instead of hundreds of thousands, of full nodes. It is still much, much, better the single nodes for traditional currencies that we use today.
@_date: 2013-10-24 22:52:55
Hey, I said "might"
Could be sooner :)
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:24:51
Would be nice to know how many people have bought into this so far.
@_date: 2013-10-22 03:41:00
I couldn't disagree more with your post! How could you possibly think that it *means nothing*?!
I agree that neither anecdote provides 100% certainty... but just like any restaurant review on Yelp, or product review on Amazon, it is VERY helpful! Also, imagine that after one person chimes in with a personal story, then another person does as well, and another... soon a clearer picture comes in focus. If we don't share these stories then we are worse off.
@_date: 2013-10-22 16:51:51
Let's share notes... I tried the upfront route with one bank already and they politely declined (Bitcoin was too high risk for them). This was a local credit union. I think upfront is the way to go... but we need to find a bank where the people in charge know a little more about Bitcoin. I think at the local credit union where I tried they only had a "headline familiarity" with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-23 01:22:42
Just buy some bitcoins with coinbase.
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:07:58
Coinbase is using a different exchange than Mt.Gox. The "real" exchange rate is much closer to what Coinbase is using. The Mt.Gox exchange rate is unreliable.
@_date: 2013-10-24 17:09:15
It could go to $1600 and "spectacularly" drop to $300. If you sold now and are waiting, you'd be screwed. 
The point is, it's hard to predict the future!
@_date: 2013-10-24 23:47:57
This is awesome. Please keep this site up to date and I will tip you bitcoins every now and then!
@_date: 2013-10-23 22:06:02
You know bitcoins still have huge upside when you read articles like this.
@_date: 2013-10-23 05:43:20
@_date: 2013-10-19 00:20:05
Let's do it!
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:04:05
It's a 1% transaction fee. Worth every penny!
@_date: 2013-10-24 22:08:58
I think the saturation price for Bitcoin will be several hundred thousand per bitcoin. Might take 10 years though.
@_date: 2013-10-24 23:54:09
I just submitted a URL. I think you have to parse it though... unless I'm misunderstanding how it works.
