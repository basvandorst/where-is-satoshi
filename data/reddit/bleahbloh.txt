Bitstamp Customers are Safe and Our Business is Solvent
We at Bitstamp have conducted a thorough audit of our bitcoin accounts, as well as the fiat currency reserves we maintain in the bank. Bitstamp maintains all of its customers’ bitcoin and cash deposits and nothing is amiss.
Bitstamp is Not Subject to the Transaction Malleability Vulnerability
Bitstamp uses a different protocol to handle problems in closing out its transactions and is not vulnerable to the “transactional malleability” issue that was apparently exploited at Mt. Gox. Additionally, we manually double-check every transactional problem encountered by our customers.

After yesterday's rumors the Central Bank requires banks to Doomsday day website shutdown bitcoin transactions a bank account. , Including coin of fire NET, OKCoin, BtcTrade, although several large coins Web site reported, close or suspend cooperation notifications received from the Bank, but the current network of bitcoin transactions the Bank channel is not completely sealed, most trading sites available are still working with a bank account, which is also mostly normal. For nearly two days, the domestic coins prices rose 20%.
Bitcoin vibe inside, closed bitcoin transactions behind the site mainly because of the bitcoin website took the opportunity to take advantage of off the market. Acceptance of the three South reporter proof of State-owned commercial bank's Guangdong Branch said that since March has not received any new notifications about coins.
Transaction Web banking channel is not sealed
"We have got a suspension notice from a Bank," yesterday afternoon, in the country the bitcoin transactions Web site BtcTrade has a greater influence on Zhang Shousong with a NaN journalist said in an interview, the platform has just received the second Bank to stop using corporate account settlement bitcoin-related notifications, user informed of its announcement is being prepared.
Banks cut off cooperation with bitcoin transactions Web site news fermentation in mid-March. Domestic media reported that the branches of the Central Bank in mid-March to the Central Bank issued a report, titled the notice on further strengthening the bitcoin work risk prevention, which requires banks and third party payment services providers, close bitcoin platforms in more than more than 10 accounts of all transactions, the deadline is April 15. Since April, a number of domestic transactions bitcoin top trading platforms have been posting announcements seems to sit this rumor is real. On April 2, BTC38. COM and FXBTC have announced the suspension of renminbi credit business, call said a number of commercial banks, requiring them to Bank to close as soon as possible. However, the South reporter noted that, unlike the two trading sites, announcements of bitcoin transactions Web site, many say only by notification of individual banks, suspended the prepaid business, while other banks not affected cooperation is still normal, so that operations remain normal.
Zhang Shousong reporters toward the South, the platform received agricultural Bank of Hangzhou city branch of science and technology, as well as another big Bank, so recharge stops processing the renminbi business starting from yesterday, but he stressed that, as other bank transactions is still normal, so the customer can be made by other banks. Zhang Shousong admitted that "we have not seen formal document, we have not received any notification from the Central Bank, banks are also notified separately. "He said, is not whether it is expected that other banks will follow, if all banks were suspended, then the business will also be affected, renminbi business will be fully stopped.
Bank said no new notifications
Worth noting is that interview over Zhang Shousong bitcoin transactions are included in Web site are expressed, although rumors have been around for a month, but they did not see the formal notification of the Bank, mostly verbal, and rumor has it the further strengthening of bitcoins working risk prevention notice nor did anyone see.
"I think is bitcoin transactions use rumor, homeopathy out of the market. "Senior bitcoin player Luo Jinhai South reporter in an interview saying that in Luo Jinhai's view, if the rumors are true, then in accordance with the provisions on April 15, all banks should suspend the service, but now many banks continued to do.
It is reported that the media reports came out in mid-March, the Central Bank on March 21 in the official clarification on Twitter, "stop all bitcoin transactions prior to April 15 to" false reports, however, does not specify whether you require banks with bitcoin transactions to suspend service.
In this regard, the South reporter to Guangdong Province, Guangdong's three State-owned banks to verify replies received indicated that: "in March at the provincial level has not notified of new bitcoins. "But these three banks also said ongoing cooperation and bitcoin transactions Web site hardly. In addition, the South reporter also told a State-owned bank Press Office for confirmation, the Bank's Press Office said the Bank now pausing of the bitcoin main according to the five ministries and commissions last year against the risk of the bitcoin notices issued. According to last year's notice requirements, financial institutions and payment institutions shall not provide coins to customers registration, trading, clearing and settlement services. As to whether the Central Bank in mid-March issued the notice on further strengthening the bitcoin work risk prevention, the State-owned bank Press Office official says, is not clear.
Turning to overseas markets?
Luo Jinhai South reporter, said, as a kind of virtual currency, compared to the policy risk, players now are more concerned about risks from bitcoin transactions site. He pointed out that some sites information is not transparent and fraud transaction data as well as the risk of misappropriation of clients ' funds.
South reporter noted that, in the face of the Bank after the ban, bitcoin transactions different operational adjustments have been made to the Web site. Substitute a prepaid code as OKCoin launched a new business. According to public information, recharge codes are divided into a and b above, paragraph a is mainly used for users to access recharge code validity and stockpiled amounts, for recharging b paragraph. Only to have both a and b can result is successful. However, this method of recharging, have player safety as well as follow-up compliance challenge. "Similar to this is a third party pay channels, and channels as before, might soon be halted. "Senior player Liu hsiang, South said.
In addition to change channels, part of the bitcoin is ready to abandon plans to market the site. BtcTrade the publication of the agricultural Bank of China also said it had suspended business in mainland China, Hong Kong, China, Japan and the United States, such as registration of the company. $ BtcT Rade will open businesses in the near future. Zhang Shousong, once the Central Bank cut 100% coins Web site transactions, network of bitcoin transactions would be forced to quit the market in favour of overseas markets and overseas customers.

*Chinese authorities want to have some control over Bitcoin, just like with the Internet. Yet in Hong Kong, even though it is in theory a completely autonomous legal system, Bitcoin strives. Do you believe the Chinese authorities want to test Bitcoin in Hong-Kong as a laboratory before deciding how to regulate it in the mainland?*
There is no truth to that last part. You said the Chinese try to encourage Hong Kong to be the Bitcoin guinea pig. There is no truth to that. I have spoken to regulators in Hong Kong. It is essentially the same attitude. Hong Kong Bitcoin regulation is not very different from that in China. They both don’t treat Bitcoin as a currency, they both don’t allow financial institutions to deal directly with Bitcoin. I have heard Hong Kong regulators talk of laissez-faire. The reality is very different. These regulators are very smart. They say we will not regulate Bitcoin, do what you want but they won’t issue bitcoin licenses to companies nor will they give carte blanche for banks to work with Bitcoin exchanges. **Today, a Bitcoin exchange in Hong Kong has to lie to open a bank account. When banks find out the truth, they shut down the accounts.** In Hong Kong, things are worse. In appearance it is free etc.. but in practice banks are governed by the HKMA (Hong Kong Monetary Authority) and they are strict. We are a Chinese business, you can imagine we have considered doing business there. The fact we do not have a robust business there shows Hong Kong is not easier.

@_date: 2014-02-14 09:37:30
about time 
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:20:43
i personally have 0 incentive to run a node, since i dont mine my node dont generate income and does not make the network more secure

Nuevo TPV BBVA.
Tarifa plana.
El Bono TPV introduce el concepto de tarifa plana mensual (pago único) frente al cobro de una tasa de descuento por operación y comisión de mantenimiento. Además, esta tarifa plana te ofrece las siguientes ventajas:
    Facturación a través del TPV BBVA sin ningún coste hasta un determinado límite de facturación (en función del Bono contratado).
    Mantenimiento gratuito del TPV y con un compromiso de reparación y/o sustitución en caso de avería en menos de 48 horas.
    Compromiso tecnológico, TPV con la tecnología más moderna, incluyendo la posibilidad de solicitar TPV GPRS con firma digital.
    Coste de las comunicaciones gratuitas en caso de TPV GPRS (TPV móvil).
Elige la modalidad que mejor se adapte a la facturación de tu Negocio y olvídate de gastos extra o comisiones.
  	Facturación 	Tarifa mensual*
BONO 10 	20.000 € 	10 €/mes
BONO 20 	40.000 € 	20 €/mes
BONO 40 	80.000 € 	40 €/mes
BONO 60 	120.000 € 	60 €/mes
BONO 120 	240.000 € 	120 €/mes
Si superas la estimación de facturación anual, solo se te aplicará una tasa de descuento del 1,1%* por operación.
Por ejemplo, si un cliente contrata el Bono TPV 10 las características del mismo son:
    El cliente paga 10 € de cuota mensual durante 12 meses. Puede facturar sin ningún coste adicional hasta 20.000 € al año. En el caso de superar más de 20.000 € en el año y “solo por el importe que exceda de 20.000 €” se le aplicará una tasa de descuento del 1,1 %.
Tasa descuento.
Y si tu volumen de facturación queda fuera de la oferta de los bonos (superior a 240.000 €), o prefieres mantener el sistema de tasas habituales frente al bono mensual, puedes contratar una TASA DE DESCUENTO para tu TPV que aplicaremos en función de la facturación, importe medio y el sector de actividad que trabajas.

*bitlane withdrew funds PRIOR to the shutdown.  He wasn't paid, he ranted about it, Pirate closed his account and promised to pay him on Monday (which is already fail because he should have been paid promptly).  Pirate then shuts down the entire operation and promises to start repayment on Monday.  72 hours go by and he has no only not repaid bitlane (a normal account closure prior to the shutdown) but hasn't repaid anyone a single cent.*

any miner should vote against if this option is delayed (the option is available later) miner get more bitcoins at a lower diff, if you plan to mine for next 2/3 years any advance in bitcoin world can bring more miners and with that a bigger diff 
@_date: 2012-09-20 13:13:19
also remember business mining have large costs and they need cash to pay bills amateur mining have low cost and ppl can pay 100-200 per month on electricity from their paycheck 
@_date: 2012-11-20 15:29:12
hmmmmm so i can trade on mtgox with 0.25% fees using bitfinex like a proxy?
@_date: 2012-04-17 17:10:49
that is nothing new since 2007 all bank accounts details go to police and any transaction over 2000 also notify the police 
@_date: 2012-12-03 20:45:07
instant transaction like cash just to start the list of things bitcoin need to do 
@_date: 2012-12-03 23:24:48
because that private police is older than California state and the join of the California state in USA, this police have nothing to do with taxes

8k btc traded a a web page that allow leverage 10:1 is a joke one single user can  make the volume, bitcoinica was in its good times(before leverage restriction to protect stupid users) ~60% of total mtgox volume, now with 10 times less volume the site can be considered dead  
@_date: 2012-01-05 02:49:30
also you can point a botnet to this pool and you wont get banned/blocked

nope, most ppl that hoard and when the price is X they want X+1 and when is there they want X+1+1 and they feel rich having something but said something dint improve much their life's, someone who save have a purpose, one of them is leave the coins to their kids, a hoarder dint have a purpose when he get the first coin, since their accumulation is aimless they accumulate for accumulation sake  
@_date: 2012-10-16 10:39:15
is not weird is NORMAL just to point a thing before even mtgox went alive a German dude(he even got on newspaper) he did own about 300k bitcoin, so stop looking for pirate walls and other bullshit, put a strategy together and trade said strategy check for flaws and fix them  
@_date: 2012-01-19 02:27:54
one this why the users that got a USB key are not validated directly ??
@_date: 2012-11-18 23:48:55
that is true but that does not mean you are free of legal issues is like is ok to have a toy but is not ok to play with it if you get my point 
@_date: 2012-12-03 20:48:25
is nothing funny in both cases you lose freedom the difference is the form of freedom, one is losing movement freedom and the other is the freedom to decide what you do with your money 
@_date: 2012-01-11 21:28:16
also OP dont know what diff is and that this miners is very very old

i see what u did there LOL
@_date: 2012-03-15 16:36:56
bitcoinica win money if you lose and win if you win because of the spreads  (you buy 4 cents more expensive and sell 4 cents lower)  
if you take 100 bitcoins from bitcoinica and sell them at 5 u have + 500 USD and you own bitcoinica 100 bitcoins  if the price of bitcoins is 7 and  you go to the market with 700 USD and buy the 100 bitcoins you own to bitcoinica = you lost 200 USD and bitcoinica got back its bitcoins 
simple no ?

@_date: 2012-12-19 00:14:13
are you sure the order does goes to mtgox ? to u have any proof that orders do not hit the mtgox market?

@_date: 2012-10-17 15:42:28
i am Romanian and Romania is not in EU but it is on EU market so you not longer have import export taxes. does romania use the euro? no, can i go to work in any part of the EU (schengen area)? no
   
does UK use the euro ? no. can anyone go in Uk just like that (schengen area)? no 
  
  
see you are a bit stupid believing that UK it is on EU based on a freaking gif
@_date: 2012-08-29 02:13:01
and that means ?
@_date: 2012-07-31 10:52:21
also withdraws should be frozen if the price go up like that 
@_date: 2012-11-30 12:32:59
USA did put a embargo on Iran and that include software is quite likely that bitcoin should not be available in Iran and if it is the foundation can have some problems

pray the speculation gods to get the price at 20 USD if that wont happen you will see the price back to 2/3 usd 
@_date: 2012-08-30 12:09:18
the money mixing cant be done if miner dont put free transaction into blocks, asking for 0.01 fee for each transaction will stop this process also will limit block size 
@_date: 2012-01-03 10:03:49
well that can be nice but do you trust anyone to do that ? the client is working like a torrent but it has to check the blocks so that make the update slow  
maybe a option to download 80% of all the chain with no checking and then check only the last 20% can be better 
@_date: 2012-01-10 08:28:39
speculators here are not welcome 
@_date: 2012-12-09 16:36:15
well i call BS on this since there are deposits and lending for leverage, so you do know something that we dont know, you are not well informed or you are lying

who needs bitcoins ? i dint need them so i sold them if more ppl like me do that the price goes down ... simple
@_date: 2012-01-05 14:53:19
he can "sell" that amount of btc at that price anytime he wants so even if 1btc is 5$ he still gets 6.21$
@_date: 2012-08-25 16:17:04
less incentives for new miners to join so it wont be much stronger 
@_date: 2012-08-31 06:17:00
for example if you use the official client they tell you to pay 0,00005 fee per transaction  custom clients can send free transactions and  most pools do put this transaction on a block, all the fees are for the miners less fees less income for miners 
@_date: 2012-07-14 05:06:09
why is Patrick running away ? maybe he took the money  ?
@_date: 2012-04-19 06:51:45
ok then you have a situation like in romania where is a 30% deficit on medics  and these who stay ask for money or they let you die, so be careful what want to regulate

i add this to a perfect example

in spain any transaction above 2000 EUR must be reported to the police  
any new account for payments or deposits must be reported to the police  
Greece /  Italy any payment above 2000 EUR must be made using bank transaction

@_date: 2012-03-21 21:09:56
if btc is a commodity you still need to pay taxes or declare that income of commodity, said commodity is value on market price and need to be registered  
other example is if you buy goods using bitcoins you need to pay import tax if the sender put the goods value on the papers on USD/EUR u pay the tax if is on btc using thai baht symbol you pay taxes using that exchange ration, if it puts bitcoins for customs 1 bitcoin is 1 euro and you will pay taxes according to that ratio

1)the action is held and i offer the lowest price, i cant ask much above the market because is illegal and competitors can offer lower prices  
2) i provide needles for the hospital using the just in time approach  
3) a hospital is open 24/7 so needs needles all the time   
4) you my friend start asking for delivers to be done on the night shift   
5) delivers made outside normal hours have other prices (usually +25% more)  
6) because most needles are delivered on night shift i make a awesome profit and your dad/mom/friend that is associate to my business receive a awesome income   or your spause that work for me get a 10 000€ per month to work from home  and doing nothing

botnets dont use GPU miners(most infected PC are crap) mining w/ cpu is slow if a share expire the pool it spend resources for nothing, all the mining requests are more likely to ddos the pool server, i dint took a serious look at this but 50 000 infected PC wont pull more that 50/60ghash/s and if that is true then the deepbit pool admin will earn 1 btc per day, i dont know about pool server costs but i dont see big margins there

actual mining expenses have nothing to do w/ today bitcoins price, every user should know that mining expenses apply over time, so July bitcoins are more expensive that today bitcoins, and if we take July in 2010 the diff was about 45 000 that means until that time ppl mined 3326400 BTC, at what cost ? well was allot lower that today, ppl who buyed 10 000 btc for 50$ still have margins today, that bitcoins are still trading around   
that cheap mined bitcoins are on the market and they rule the offers, 50% of today bitcoins where made at a diff lower that 45 000 never forget that

@_date: 2013-03-21 08:09:47
and how is that relevant to the mtgox-coinlab deal 
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:01:32
true u have that , so what? before having the bitcoin someone has to mine it so you still rely on a 3rd party to make the transaction check and to say you have this amount of bitcoin, then you private key can be used to initiate a transaction that a 3rd party need to check(mine) so your bitcoins get assigned to other address  
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:29:52
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:26:17
just to make this clear that project is just the code to clone mtgox and nothing more 
@_date: 2013-05-27 14:02:25
they promise to give me eternal life 
@_date: 2013-10-13 15:58:51
dont you see what OP have to endure, there is small step when another Joe buy bitcoin then the market drop 20% he will start to scream "scam" go to the police and start a shit storm, ofc he wont be right the only thing he will do is create problems for the vendor (exchange or person) making this spend time and money in lawyers and all that "crap"
    
dont you see on OP what the retard did ? he did not even create a ticket/email support he went directly "crazy" this is the perfect example why you dont want retards into bitcoin and dont worry the bitcoin value will go up without them on the same way gold went up from 35USD and the average Joe did not own or invest in gold  
@_date: 2013-01-13 18:22:57

@_date: 2013-11-10 21:55:51
nope to have your bitcoins a 3rd party need to put it on a block and they make the checks, your client just scans/reads the blockchain you like a single individual user dont have any "say" on that process 
@_date: 2013-07-29 12:29:28

dont joke with that is serious 
      
also 
@_date: 2013-11-12 15:31:31
that did not happen when deepbit was doing that on 2011 and the network primary chain is always the longest chain so if some one has 51% of mining power they will always have the longest chain and any secondary chain will be abandoned 
@_date: 2013-10-09 11:06:02
there was some problem with the api there is no way that bitstamp can make 2x mtgox volume 
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:35:18


when nobody want to buy at market
@_date: 2013-10-09 19:29:02
the volume on this exchange is extremely low it never get to 100 btc per day 
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:19:18


if you want to go on the validation of coins i can bet there can be more that the pools u get on btc  and on the gold side you still dont need to validation of 51% just your own, on the other hand u can buy some insurance for gold validity i am sceptic that someone will provide a 51% insurance for bitcoins 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:27:44
the only problem it use bitcoinica code (ruby) and nobody know how much was fixed everything else looks OK 
@_date: 2013-10-23 09:40:49
now is over 150% per year
@_date: 2013-08-05 21:40:43
can suffer loses if the wire get rejected and the user take the btc out of mtgox 
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:14:55

yes, you do pay because is 300%/365=0.8219% per day and then is per hour 0.82/24=0.04324 so even if you take a loan just for one hour you pay the 300% per year

This has always been the case, and we were still crediting customer accounts before receiving the funds ourselves, but some cases in which the bank subsequently rejected the deposits meant that we incurred significant losses. The risk is now too high for us to credit accounts prematurely.

ask mtgox for risk review and you can move money faster and the limits get removed so u can move more that 100k per day 
@_date: 2013-10-16 03:51:30




@_date: 2013-08-06 04:53:52


 
            
over 100k thats a bug or something 
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:27:58
again u put BS on the table .... gold dont require a 3rd party (miner) in order for a transaction to happen gold just require a buyer and a seller nothing more, there is no need for other to agree on the transaction, to give the OK to a transaction, ignoring that fact means you are directly bias or retard 
@_date: 2013-10-20 20:07:50

Dividing this value with the bitcoin supply to get the current value of one bitcoin, this means that the current value of one bitcoin, as backed by exchange of products and services in its role as a transactional currency, is roughly one US dollar and twelve US cents. And that’s still a generous estimate.
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:49:07
last one that did that lost 400millions also thats the proper description for hft firms 
@_date: 2013-10-15 12:36:01
this is good news for the price but not for privacy remember they do give away your ssl to the Chinese gov on the same way CF give your ssl to NSA           
                      
i bet bitcoiners wont care about the privacy and care only about the price .......

this will make some bitcoiners rage but 1) gold dont require a 3rd party(miner) participation for a transaction to happen 2) gold dont require the approval of 51% of mining power for a transaction to happen 
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:07:40
OP should add this: this is zero sum game your gain is other person loss and you loss is other person gain 
@_date: 2013-10-16 00:05:46
