Thanks for calling me stupid.
im going to be nice and explain to you and not call you any names. Wish me luck: 




it's not that small blocks are good. It's simply the fact that we have 1MB blocks right now, and in order to change to to either 2MB, unlimited or  30 bytes, would require a hard fork, and that means we'll end up with two chains. Does that make sense?


see my answer above. 


segwit is a softfork. It does not split the chain in two. Also, it raises block capacity by removing witness data out of the block, since they are not needed after TXs are mined in blocks. Let me give you an analogy: 
Segwit : take all this crap out of your trunk, you don't need it. There! see, there is more room! 
BU: im going to add a trailer to the back of my car and fill it up since im out of room in my trunk. 
      How big will this trailer be?
      Oh.. unlimited. It could be small, or it could be 18 wheeler size. It all depends. DOn't worry.. it will be fine.

@_date: 2017-03-11 02:22:47
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:42:39
Most of BU fans are pretty green when it comes to crypto, since they think "big blocks.. must be better... Durrrrr.. like my Diiiiiaaaack.. bigger....DUUUHHHRRR" so maybe they don't know that they are being led by a full blown crook. 
thanks for your concern .

THERE IS NO PROBLEM.  IT'S NOT A BUG. IT'S A FEATURE.  ANYONE CLAIMING BITCOIN HAD A POWER PROBLEM DOESN'T UNDERSTAND PROOF OF WORK.  
Wanna save the bees? Tell Vegas to reduce power consumption.  Tell professional sports.  Tell than den of pedophiles Hollywood to stop wasting power.  Stop wars.  They use a lot of energy. Stop shilling.  No WE DON'T NEED TO REDUCE BITCOINS ENERGY CONSUMPTION.  THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT THE DATABASE IMMUTABLE.  WHAT DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?

His equations don't even work out. To the point where you have to add 96% dark matter and dark energy. You might as well believe in the virgin birth. All bs. Scientific goboligook. Einstein was a fraud. Not only that,  but he had not a single original thought
Curved space was thought of by Bernhard Riemann. Adding a 4th dimension that of time to geometry to create "space-time", by Hermann Minkowski. The idea that objects contract in proportion to the speed that which that they move, by George Francis, FitzGerald. The notion that the velocity of light in a vacuum was constant regardless of the motion of any object connected with the light ray by Hendrik Lorentz. Was he the first to bring up the impossibility of measuring light through the ether, after the Michelson Morly experiment null results? No! That was actually Henri Poincare. Did he even come up with the name relativity? NO! that was Poincare. How about no velocity can exceed the speed of light? Nope! Poincare! How about that whole clock business? you know, the fact that if you go at the speed of light, you age slower than if you stood on earth? NOPE That was actually Sir Joseph Larmor. Was he the one who came up with matter crinkles curved space? sorry to say no. That was actually William Kingdon Clifford. okok.. what about E=MC2? nope. J. J. Thomson came up with E = 3/4 MC2 and then later on our buddy Poincare came up with E=MC2 when he spoke to mass density in relation to energy density. I can go on and on...lets not forget all the shit he stole from Oliver Heaviside. Dude was a piece of shit. A lot like Ver I bet.
