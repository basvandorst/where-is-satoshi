Its not only him, most of the top EDM DJs based on LA have crypto.
I've seen them discuss it over twitter.
@_date: 2018-08-24 03:44:38
interesting perspective to say the least
@_date: 2017-02-09 22:27:00
I still don't understand how this works. If I have $1000 in my bank account, how do i buy BTC with bitquare.
@_date: 2017-02-25 00:17:56
Let's just say post Gawker Gizmodo has quite an obvious political agenda.
Get your tech news somewhere else 
@_date: 2017-02-27 06:55:18
I can see what you're saying.
More concretely, I know that some of my BTC has been converted to LSD ;)
@_date: 2017-02-05 03:23:38
Does anyone think perhaps some new miner tech is being deployed somewhere??
@_date: 2017-02-25 02:23:55
I get that, but you must have missed their daily TMZ-level articles. Cool down vote bro
@_date: 2017-03-10 03:29:42
Yup, this is the proper way to do it! 
@_date: 2017-02-02 08:54:34
lol why would someone say this with such confidence 
@_date: 2017-02-06 03:18:15
This has been showing all the time here in Canada on TV and even before movies!
@_date: 2017-02-10 02:16:32
very interesting, thank you.
@_date: 2017-03-28 01:54:56
is this fake news 
@_date: 2017-03-02 08:36:23
Ahhh yes Bitcoin CEO 
@_date: 2017-03-29 23:01:47
Canadian here who did some bitcoin mining. 6c/kwh.....but with taxes comes to an effective rate of 12c/kwh :(
$cad of course 
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:28:26
I made it for someone who wants to make a trade with speedy info, if you're not going to do that, then no need to hate :)

I recommend this place for OTC ;)
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:36:14
*opens IDE*
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:21:10
What's the deadline threshold and date for BU activation?
@_date: 2017-03-30 03:38:30
Gonna save me a trip downtown ;)
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:13:13
Shouts out to coinables ( I just modified his original script :)
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:57:03
It's not a good time for the good ol canadian peso
@_date: 2016-12-18 09:34:51
My prediction: $2,375
@_date: 2016-11-02 16:17:29
Probably hodling until regime change. Total collapse is inevitable
@_date: 2016-12-31 00:23:50
As a colombian who was thinking of starting up some bitcoin operations there, very sad.
This basically exposes how corrupt our country is.
@_date: 2016-12-31 01:12:31
No way can they can enforce transactions or running software.
However, this will impact bitcoin mining, companies accepting BTC, and onramps.
Basically, it'll be pushed underground.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:58:10
I already celebrated in canadian dollars
can't wait to meme again tho
@_date: 2017-04-20 18:47:30
Yeah sure, I'd like to know what the figure is after paying music licenses
@_date: 2017-10-04 17:56:02
This is fucking scary 
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:01:02
These are dank 
@_date: 2018-07-11 18:56:40
So he thinks that Bitcoin price will ten x 
@_date: 2018-02-08 09:16:12
duh we'll be buying citadels instead
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:27:26
As someone who is trying to make crypto based software in Canada .... FUCK
This is not a free market
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:12:35
Yeah you're right... To a certain point.
Do you know how difficult it is to become a bank in Canada? Lots and lots of gov regulations protecting the big 5 from competition.
@_date: 2018-04-11 01:33:11
I can get coins easy, it's the normies I'm worried about. If they can't get 1 click ETH via coinbase all ETH-based consumer facing endeavours have no future.
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:37:15
With current fees moving my Bitcoin is quite an investment lmao 
@_date: 2017-06-22 02:34:41
What about.... coinBits haha 
@_date: 2018-12-05 01:42:52
That article is some of the most obvious FUD I've seen in a loooong time.
