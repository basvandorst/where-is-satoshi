Its like a 1.50.  Or about .5% of what i sent.  Goes to the pawn shop.
@_date: 2016-04-03 01:30:55
Ive used rebit.ph.  They convert the btc to pesos and have it ready at a local pawn shop to pick up.  Pretty fair rates.  Better than xoom for cash transfers.  
@_date: 2016-04-03 02:36:10
Im not sure if rebit takes cash.  I think if you used the cash to buy bitcoins in circle and then transferred bitcoins it should work fine.
My uncle who picked up the cash said he was charged like 60 pesos to pick up once.  Which is weird since I thought all fees were covered.  Could also been language differences.
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:31:59
Sort of... Go to github and fork bitcoin.  Adjust some parameters, bam, new coin.

I sold like 5 a few years back to pay for my computer I still use today.  Im hoping my next sell will pay off my Tesla.
@_date: 2019-07-29 04:39:46
But what they send to the irs matters
@_date: 2019-07-29 04:39:02
That's what I'm saying.  The document they send to the irs says these coins disappeared from this dudes account and should be valued at over $$$ if sold.  Then if you just moved it to a hardware wallet, the irs comes knocking asking what you did
@_date: 2019-07-29 00:34:56
Coinbase counts it as a sell.  If you pull their tax excel forms it assumes all moves out of coinbase are sells and you need to adjust if not true.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:02:37
They still have the arbitrage rate, just no transaction fee.

My take on this has been to do BIP 102 immediately with BIP 103 as the medium term plan.  This looks good.

@_date: 2017-02-26 20:02:34
I wrote a paper basically concluding the same idea.
@_date: 2014-02-02 01:57:26
I would set up a program that all current social security payments become something like myRA and a 401k.  Then use taxes to offset social security payments for current retirees and gradually taper it off over the next thirty years until the workforce sustains themselves through their individual forced retirement savings.
@_date: 2015-05-14 23:57:41
Easily rectified by sending people home if they are sick. I do it quite often. 
@_date: 2016-03-11 04:55:10
Bip 103 is ok to do for medium term, but we need a big increase this year and then can do a slow steady increase over time or some other method.  100% block capacity is expected in October at 1Mb.  17% would give us another 4 months before we would need another increase.  I believe 103 was a quarterly 4.25% increase. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 05:56:55
Well it was Un profitable at 200 a coin but we are at 4k a coin.... So long game it was good to operate at a short loss.
Probably better just to buy and hold
@_date: 2016-11-19 04:01:42
Maybe we are talking about separate instances.  
If i buy bitcoin and encrypt my wallet and then forget my password, I can still see my bitcoins, but cannot spend or use them.  Thus no cost basis.
@_date: 2016-11-19 01:15:24
Losing them means it has no cost basis.  You still own them.
@_date: 2019-10-05 05:48:50
I was thinking it was buy a $1000 worth.  But yes you are right
@_date: 2019-10-03 21:15:52
20000 is 200,000 higher than 10 cents, so 1000 coins would be 200M
@_date: 2019-06-03 08:35:43
Well i kicked myself for not doing 200 a month since 2012, so been doing that now.
@_date: 2019-10-03 21:16:36
I take it you never bought using a red phone
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:31:34
I did some back of the napkin math and if 10k of us ran 1070s or r9 390x, we could impact nearly a third of the hashing rate
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:51:41
A 1070 should do about 25 MH/S.  10k 1070s would mean 2.5 TH/S.  It might not be profitable, but could be impactful. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:37:49

I have sent using rebit a few times.  I just found out my uncle had to pay a fee to cebuana llhulier to pick up the money.  Not quite cool but still better than western union, but xoom might be better.

You ever hear the story of the peasant who asked the king to be paid one rice the first day, but doubles every day for a month, thus bankrupting the kingdom?
1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 etc 2^30.  Keep doing that until 2^256.  Even at a trillion calculation per second it would still take a shit load of time to crack a 256 bit hash.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:57:02
I moved on to mining Litecoins.  I get about 3 a day and they are equivalent to about .06-.08 BTCs (EDIT: PER DAY - BTCE is .02 LTC/BTC) when you do a transfer on BTC-E.
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:18:05
Same thing happened to me.  I posted a few minutes after you.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:49:10

Do we bet in dollars or credits?  How does it work with BTC deposits?  Is it an instant bitpay transfer to USD? 
The reason I ask is it might be interesting seeing mass a wealth in strict BTC payments.

Bitinstant had similar poor issues when they started.  Are they even around?

@_date: 2013-04-09 23:08:29
When you all do Bitinstant-&gt; Bit Address it may be helpful to send an exchange rate, fees associated, and exchange.  Due to the non-transparency of my previous transaction I wanted to do it myself on MtGOX, with full intention of doing it near immediately.  I fear when this is resolve I will be left with $200 in MtGox and purchase &lt;1 BTC since it has been almost a full week.

I don't want her to go through the process of finding a buyer after she gets the Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:54:39
They would see it go to an exchange address and disappear.  Those same coins won't be yours once you sell them.  
Sell BTCs with Address A to buy Litecoins with address B.  Transfer Litecoins from address B to Litecoin address C.  Sell litrcoins from address C for Bitcoins in address D.

What else would I do with $200 on mtgox?
@_date: 2013-10-25 06:39:43
Think of it as your checking account tied to a debit card, or even your own personal wallet.  You don't go around with 10k in your wallet, you put it in a safe, or a savings account.  Same idea here.  When you want to make big purchases you go through the process of taking money from the safe and putting it in your hot wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:57:55
I sold 1/5 of my holdings to cover all the costs I put into it.  Now I can ride the Bitcoin train with no affect on my personal stake in the matter.
I haven't used it for gyft cards yet, but humble bundles are fun to use it for.
@_date: 2013-10-30 03:43:33
I'm on a similar boat.  It was at $125 for a while and was trying to buy some, but I'm in a foreign country and localbitcoins was a little expensive and seemed shady.  Someone tipped me off to coinbase, which is infinitely times easier to get into than some other exchanges.  I bought a BTC yesterday at $195, and will just invest that much each month.

I'm in the same boat, but I used the M0000X format and their site tells me to use 0000 format.  I contacted both Bitinstant and Mtgox.  Bitinstant sent me a quick reply that the transaction record gave me a Mtgox Coupon, but using it on the site doesn't work.  Still waiting =(
@_date: 2013-04-15 01:01:48
I had a similar issue, MTGox was right around 100 and it was bought for 104ish.  They need to at a minimum include some transparency in the trade (The price at the given time/top 10 lowest sell orders/the price they got you)
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:19:08
The code was never redeemed because the code was invalid once I was told to use it.  If your team contacts me via email I will gladly provide proof that there is no transaction history for my mtgox account.
