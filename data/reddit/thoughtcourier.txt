This is bullshit mixed with a little truth. 
The Ukrainian countryside and many things appear 3rd world, many things are very "Soviet" (like toilet paper), but many things are also very modern (like their IT outsourcing capabilities). Most Ukrainians are definitely not on drugs, though drugs are cheaper there (like everything else), so many adventurers drop in for them.
Take a look at Kyiv on google maps, maybe watch an orel i reshka episode to a Ukrainian destination, read about the Hrvynia's problems and talk to some Ukrainians in your country. Maybe go and see for yourself.

This is an interesting take on things, but I dislike two lines of thought on here:
1) That we need a professor's terribly nuanced understanding of Bitcoin technology to identify Satoshi. 
I wrote this [piece on Newsweek/Dorian]( the last time around which got picked up a bit, maybe because it was simple and had a measured tone. The TL;DR of it is that if you must write about this, then you should first consult the internet for the fatal flaws. This time, the missed fact is that SN is never going to be coy about being SN. He will either reveal himself or deny it until confronted with a mountain of evidence.
2) That the author might know who Satoshi is. 
This sounds a bit like self-promotion. Like you could discover who he is if you hung out with the author more. In good faith, I'll assume this is a mistake on the part of the author, but please be responsible and just don't go down that road. Especially with anyone media-related.
About this entire fiasco: 
I'm not half as mad at Wired as I was at Newsweek last time. I think the author/researcher knew and strongly implied behind the scenes that CSWright was not SN, but the editor went ahead anyways because they put in *some* good journalistic work.

Today (or rather yesterday), I was at the Texas Bitcoin Conference in Austin. It was awesome. I met a legion of capable individuals working in the Bitcoin space. But when I finally had a chance to sit down and read and talk about my experience online, I could only find people buzzing about how Newsweek had found Satoshi Nakamoto.
The article has, of course, now been debunked, but I am still peeved at Newsweek. They wasted a really good day for internal Bitcoin community education. Unless they were hoping for a quick fix or a rebranding, Newsweek’s owners should also be peeved. No credible news organisation would have published this article. And since an in-credible news organisation is just a tabloid, Newsweek has just lost the readership who reads this article and discovers the truth. This article is the front page story of their new first print edition. So, nice work there.
Mistakes were made aplenty in the printing of this article. One minor mistake would be to  identify someone when there is no good reason to disrespect their privacy. Another mistake would be masquerading as your subject in order to obtain private records. This is clearly illegal and, to me, morally wrong. To me, the real first mistake is that finding Satoshi isn’t even really a newsworthy pursuit. I suppose it sells well, though. But enough about those mistakes; I’ll let others them in detail. The mistake I would like to focus on is the mistake of not consulting the internet about any of this.
How do I know the reporter did not consult the internet about her find? Well, maybe she did. In some circumspect manner. But I find it hard to believe that anyone who has spent any time investigating Satoshi online would look at the evidence she saw, and say “I don’t have any doubt (it’s the creator of Bitcoin)”. If they would, I’d like to sit across the poker table from them someday (and I don’t play poker). Online, we have a couple standards of doubt we use to determine the truthfulness of claims about Satoshi.
One fairly speculative method of investigation is to compare writing styles. Satoshi can be more than one person, but at least one of them writes proper English. Below is Dorian’s writing style. A redditor found it from an Amazon review and reported it within less than a workday of this breaking story. An outside observer must have been amazed at his quick research, but once you realize that we’ve used this criterion for years (centuries in Bitcoinland), it seems rather obvious how we found this information so quickly.
A somewhat less speculative method is to find Satoshi’s hardware. In a series of blog entries, an excellent researcher uses artifacts in the Bitcoin public ledger to make some educated guesses as to what hardware Satoshi used to mine Bitcoins. No attempt was made to locate this artifact. The reporter did not indicate she asked Dorian or his family any questions about perhaps the only unencrypted physical evidence we can obtain about Satoshi.
The gold standard for proving that someone is Satoshi is definitely not claiming, without recorded evidence, to have heard him say “I am no longer involved in that”. It’s getting him to sign a message that only the creator of Bitcoin can sign. He can sign from his PGP key that he used to communicate with the world, or he can sign from the very first entry in the blockchain ledger that he created. He has various other keys too (Bitcoin-QT alert key), and any one of them will work. And even then, some people will still have doubts. Certainly, you cannot counterfeit cryptographic signatures and everyone can verify their authenticity. However, Satoshi could have given his keys away. At the very least, though, you can be sure that your subject i in possession of Nakamoto’s keys. These are among his most private, personal, and valuable of possessions. Unless there were huge red flags, I would then be comfortable using the words “without a doubt”.
So, how do I know all this? I know all this simply because I read the internet. This reporter, her research team (“research team”? “research” team?), clearly don’t know how to use the  internet. If Newsweek had simply proposed their Nakamoto in a way that protected their piece, the internet (Reddit, StackExchange, Quora, or various relevant niche forums) would have asked them about their criteria and debunked their theory immediately.
Instead, they used their own arbitrary contrived criteria that seemed credible to the general public to write a fantasy piece that wasted everyone’s time. When operators fail to work the basics of a system, engineers utter an expression that predates the internet era: “Read the fucking manual” (RTFM). This is a news organisation failing in a very basic way to report the news. And so, my advice as an engineer is this: 
Dear Newsweek, 
The internet is your “fucking manual”. Your interactive and extremely thorough manual. Try and use it next time you attempt journalism.
TL;DR: See title.
Edit: I've corrected some grammar on my blog itself. Sorry about the occasional missing word.

There are about a billion ways that MTGOX could have had safeguards in place. Even if the only thing they did was make sure the customer support guy in charge of crediting accounts had enough technical understanding of the protocol to investigate before "refunding" customers, they would have been fine.
Back when CB was hiring and had a random technical test on the protocol, I wondered why their support staff would need such familiarity. And now I approve of this practice.

Hey... I disagree. Bitcoin is not explicitly about fairness and equality, but by being neutral it certainly enables it.
In this case we are seeing a free market evolve around mining with only tiny interference (cough, irs). It sounds very fair to me that a guy who invests a lot of capital and takes big risks gets rewarded.

Thanks for replying.
I would be willing to bet $1,000 that Dorian Nakamoto is not the creator of Bitcoin. Against a stake of $10. Or $1. Actually, I'm not allowed to do this legally, so I will donate this if it turns out to be true somehow.
Whether or not this is newsworthy is not my main issue with the article, so debate that as you will in another thread.
My point is that we've been doing this "bullshit internet detective" work for awhile, which is why we were able to scrounge up the AMZN reviews that showed a very dissimilar style almost immediately.
I *do* think they should look for his hardware. His keys may be in his brain, hidden behind a cryptographic volume. But there's likely a purchase history of his hardware. He may not have even destroyed it.
I speak as an engineer because that is what the world sees me as. I have the most credibility speaking as an engineer who seeks broken proceesses. And my point is that while the case seems credible to "most" people, the Bitcoin community knows immediately how incredible their evidence was. They should have asked. They needed to have asked.

This is precisely the incorrect thinking that causes FUD to prevail. It *is* for all intents and purposes like turning their miners off.
You cannot continue contributing mining power to the current blockchain and contribute it towards your 51% attack, secret or non-secret. You can have an "unknown" pool submitting the blocks, but that's not contributing to your attack. In fact, it's working against your attack.

I try not to add to the speculation because I wish this story would go away for awhile. That being said, Satoshi can be more than one person, so this doesn't disprove he's the creator.

I've been wondering this. Mark "isn't an idiot", supposedly.
Once there is no mystery about private keys and whether they're stolen, lost, or controlled by him, he's done. The return of the information to the public marks his end.
There's very few scenarios in my mind where his lifestyle improves from the present after he steps down. 
Our only real carrot to get him to be quick and transparent is the promise that his lifestyle will be drastically better than what it would have been if he drags it out and tries to 
somehow outmaneuver the entire Bitcoin community.
But we don't really hold that carrot. He's definitely committed some kind of fraud. And we aren't the people who will be prosecuting him for fraud. If he's opaque, he can hold out for some miracle buyout or haircut where he can acknowledge no wrongdoing and escape with his life. 
Let's take a minute here and think, as a community and/or his creditors (if you are), what *real* leverage we have on him, and stop writing him open letters which he will simply ignore.

To be honest, I feel satoshi himself would probably not mind if he absolutely had to keep printing a tiny amount of bitcoins a year. The key is that monetary policy is set in stone.
However satoshi would never actually code this because having a cap is much more elegant to explain and write. What you've just discovered is how the dogecoin devs are a bunch of hacks. I think in the coming months we will discover more comedic brogramming as dogecoin deals with problems like blockchain bloat.

the antminer ethernet interface I believe is just a simple router. So, you can connect it to your computer directly, and then don't connect your computer to anything else.
You need to set your computer to have a default gateway in the 192.168.1 range, I believe, and then you can modify antminer settings from that point.

In not so insulting terms, pretty much.
So, you're telling me that the U.S. government decides to seize assets to launch a *quiet* investigation, and when MTGOX informs them that they'll sink *very loudly* without those assets, the U.S. government does nothing? 
OK.

Nope. Come on WSJ. Bitcoin has been on your radar for over a year now. We can at least do 1M transactions per day before anyone would argue about limits being hit. We have some issues to worry about like the decreasing number of full nodes and mining centralization but that is nothing like what's being described here.

As an amateur Buffettologist, I have to agree. I was sold on value investing before I got into Bitcoin (I still am).
Bitcoin currently does not make for a working currency. That's alright, we can fix that.
I also accept that the money I've put into Bitcoin was speculative, in that I could not put together a solid thesis as to why I believed the purchasing power of my Bitcoins would definitely increase.
The bitcoin protocol and bitcoin businesses however, should provide this world with some value, and hopefully we'll be able to show people this instead of just talking about it.
I've often told people I'd know what Buffett would do if BTC takes off -- he probably wouldn't invest in BTC tech businesses. But he'd probably divest of AMEX.


@_date: 2014-03-14 14:31:54

Investment, as defined by value investors, is pretty much "delaying gratification for a premium". Beating inflation with no other tradeoffs is extremely remarkable, which is why savings accounts and money market funds hardly distribute anything.
You can do that with stocks all the time, but you risk volatility.
You can do it with bond coupons, but you risk liquidity.
etc. etc.

So you want the network to keep single signed transactions for... How long before including or excluding from a block?

I keep bringing this up, and Bitcoiners look at me like I'm an idiot. Yes, I know the 750,000 coins are worth more frickin' money, but the 30M in fiat CAN'T disappear overnight, and it can't be hacked. Even if hackers stole Bitcoins and resold them, fiat would stay balanced. There's no way for fiat balances to get out of whack if they kept customer accounts separate from corporate/insider trading accounts. Think about it, guys. Seriously.

I would not put the magnitude of their failure on the same level as BFL, but they did overpromise and underdeliver. 
The biggest disappointment was actually that they didn't deliver on time. People were hoping for a understated hashrate to compensate for that, but this didn't happen. In fact, the hashrate was also overstated.
The coupon compensation essentially comes out to CoinTerra making money and their customers not.
There should be some happy medium where Cointerra makes a decent profit, and so do their customers. Even with their serious miss on timelines. But if you look at the products that people are generally happy about (KnC,Ant,BitFury) vs not (BFL,HF,CT), this is the main difference.
@_date: 2014-01-16 23:35:15
I agree in the most part here, except for with HashFast which promised full refunds in BTC up to a certain point in time. Probably though, given enough lawyering, they could finagle themselves out of that obligation.

Well, I'm not your target audience, but I still feel like you should know this. When I actually bought/mined the majority of my BTC, I laid out my plan as an investment decision and stuck to it. 
There were some times when there was impactful news, but I didn't learn anything new that would change my decision.
So, I think if you are all frantic and worried and trying to justify things, you should read more about investing.

I used to be very annoyed by the panicking since there are so many more useful things to worry about. Now I've just accepted that people don't understand there are so many other safeguards in place.

Step 0: We need to get to Karpeles somehow and figure out WTH is going on. AFAIK he's declaring bankruptcy, and if that goes through, this isn't.

How much computer hardware have you bought before? The antminer guides out there are somewhat out of date. If you have 2x PCI-E rails that can deliver 300W power, it's plug and play (and jump your mobo cable).
Most PSUs rated for ~400V can't deliver that power on the PCI-E rails. My 430V Corsair couldn't so I ended up using a 1000W one. A bit overkill, but I didn't have anything else. Google around to see if yours can.

I stopped listening when the interviewer asked her about why she didn't verify via signature and she said that it was because the original block needed to be spent to sign a message and she thinks Gavin told her so (paraphrasing). 
Satoshi has many keys and we all know the genesis block can't be spent. If you are a newbie reading this, SN just needs to verify ownership. Nothing new needs to go on the blockchain.
I don't think it ever occurred to her this is what any of us would ask SN to do. Despite, you know, every other thread ever basically saying this is the first thing they'd ask him.

Fairly well-written responses. Mostly what I would say except for his response to the 51% question because I would emphasize the "loss of faith" aspect.
No one really cares that the USGovt and/or Fed could absolutely destroy the USD, their lifeblood, in some completely stupid "attack" attempt to introduce hyperinflation or stop all international transactions.

Hi Superintendent Lawsky. 
I am not a New Yorker, but as a longtime Bitcoiner who has read summary, these laws will definitely need significant revision before people will consider them reasonable. The last 3 highlights are the worst. 


This should obviously be permitted. Taxes based on rising exchange rates sounds like a reasonable alternative.


Nobody wants this. Forfeiture to the state should only occur if forfeiture to company is the other option.


This is strange and somewhat technically taxing. It also cuts into profits as services typically mix new coins and send out some combination of older ones to save on transaction fees.

Oh boy.
So, you definitely want to head over to custom hardware.
Do you have a windows computer on the network you're using?
- First, check for a sticker on your antminer for the IP address. I believe new ones are on 192.168.1.99. Old ones are on 192.168.2.99 or something like that. That third number is the subnet.
- Press Start + R and run "cmd" to get a command prompt.
- type in ipconfig
- your computer has an address of 192.168.&lt;subnet&gt;.XX
- To interface with the antminer, you need the subnet to be the same as the antminer. To access your router to change the subnet, you need your router's IP. It's probably 192.168.&lt;Computer's subnet&gt;.01
- Poke around and change the router to 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.2.1, depending on which subnet your antminer is on.
- Once you change the subnet, you need to reconnect your computer, you can type in ipconfig/renew or whatever you usually do to r/c a broken connection.
- Now you can access your antminer on whatever IP address it is on.
- Follow Dogie's instructions to change the pools to your pools, or else it will be mining for the antminer team. I recommend eligius.st or btcguild for the simplest setups.

Look at this guide, which is the de-facto best guide for antminers, but not the most up-to-date:
No-look guess:
New antminers appear to be set on the 192.168.1.xx subnet. Is your router on that subnet? Do you know what I'm asking you? 
@_date: 2014-03-12 21:18:32
It's possible; although that's really odd unless you're in some kind of corporate setup.
The antminer's IP is 192.168.1.1? I doubt that. It should be 192.168.1.XX
You should change your router to 192.168.1.1. Reconnect your computer to the router, since it won't recognize the new subnet right away, and then type in 192.168.1.XX into a browser to access your antminer.

First, I'd like to point out that I am now quibbling about the technicalities that I brought up in my top-level post. And there's no point in defending the WSJ when you point out that the limit even now is 600k and not 50k.
Transactions with fees haven't been delayed due to a queue since November. Delays happen now because many pools don't insert zero-fee transactions and pools have also capped their own block sizes (sometimes to 0).
Next, people who are running full nodes now are *not* hobbyists. That, or they didn't hear the call to not run a full node unless they have appropriate bandwidth. It would be great if they would stop running nodes that are doing more harm than good. If/when the volume increases 10x, most current full node solutions will work even if we assume that for some reason we kept hardware and software the same.

Well, I guess there's not much we can do while they make a full investigation, but there are obvious red flags. Look at the fiat. Thieves can hack all the BTC out of MTGOX and completely destroy its trade engine, and not a single fiat dollar would be missing. Even if reconciliation happened once a month, books don't go out of balance $30M in a month, especially when withdrawals are at a standstill. 
In February, someone in senior management told mtgox employees (SarahCoinBit) to tell customers that they were solvent. Whoever that was committed fraud. Either they stated this without checking the books (unlikely), or knew the books were cooked and gave the go-ahead to lie (the obvious choice).

This whole issue is overblown. Consider the actual scenario:
GHASH.io will have to take their mining power offline and point it to their alternative blockchain. If they immediately start attacking, we will know right away. If they hold off, we will know within a couple blocks when the network inexplicably slows by half. Once discovered we can always rollback the protocol to before the attack.
In the meantime, they are losing ~75BTC/hr in mining rewards, so even if they aren't trying to double-spend and just DOS the system, it's costing them more than a half million a day to do it.

The fact that he would have been working in the highly visible mtgox office at least 8 hours a day and not be able to work on SR.
The fact that MTGOX's transaction history has actually been hacked, leaked and analyzed, and nothing links them clearly to SR.
The fact that Mark's poor OpSec lead to this MTGOX hack anyway, and SR probably would have been broken much more quickly with him working on it.

I've read this and Theymos's original modding proposal. At this point, I think it's reasonable to allow XT discussion in this subreddit, and agree with Meni that it's a suboptimal way of pushing through changes to the Bitcoin protocol.
The assumption by Theymos that looks most likely to be wrong is that XT is unlikely to become the consensus bitcoin client. I still think it is highly unlikely (most likely: the changes are finally absorbed by bitcoin-core), but, to me, it really has ventured into the realm of possibility.
@_date: 2012-02-12 08:34:12
Neither reply is right because they are simulating the wrong thing. We need to take our college math knowledge and apply them to the right situations.
Let's say we have a 10-sided die.
Every second, we timestamp and put a $1 coin into a pot and then roll once. If there is a roll of 10, all the money is cleared out of the pot.
Now, the average pot will have $10. This is right. But this is NOT what doktorlaser wanted to know. The thing we want to know is how much time the coins have been in there. How convenient that I timestamped them! 
For any pot of $N, you will find the total time that coins to be n * (n-1) / 2. Test this out (1 coin = 0, 2 coins = 0+1, 3 coins = 0+1+2). That means the average time a single coin has been in there is (n-1) / 2. 
The 1 is insignificant because N will actually be a very large # and the time period will actually be (insert-really-small-prefix)-seconds.
So N/2. Half.
In bitcoin terms:
If the block took 1000 minutes to solve, the age of the average transaction is 500. 
If the block 2 minutes to solve, the age is 1.
No matter how much each block weighs when you do your weighted average of them, the age of the average transaction is going to be half. Since we actually know the weighted average block discovery time (10mins), the age of the weighted average transaction time is 5 minutes.
So, assuming all transactions can fit into the nearest block and that transaction volume is steady (or reasonably random)...
 
TL;DR doktorlaser is right.

Your friend's numbers are rather odd from a mathematical standpoint. If he's only been running for 10 hours, I'd look for some type of outlier. 
I am not quite sure what you mean by "downloaded openCL" and "can't even access my graphics card". Did you literally have to download openCL (despite likely having an nvidia driver)? What is the actual error message that kiv's gui miner is giving you?
Basic debugging is a fairly logical process where you examine the chain of things that could go wrong and iterate through all of them. So, maybe you should first try using another openCL miner, then using another type of gfx card miner overall, etc. etc. until you fix the problem.

@_date: 2012-10-04 15:52:17
A important distinction here. Unless 50% + 1 of the *hashing power* agrees, it won't take hold. Monetary policy and transactions in Bitcoin are both decided by the majority of computing power on the network. If user/miner A has 10% of the power, user B has 1%, and end user C has 0%, C has no power over monetary policy or if his transactions will go through (get written into the bitcoin public ledger).
As a user of Bitcoins, his faith in the currency will be placed in the miners not to alter the current monetary policy or change the current method of transacting. Most people here have this faith. I do.
But make sure to give him the full facts, or he may be angry.

@_date: 2012-02-01 22:45:16
Well, actually, if I was an actual attacker, I would hijack/grow a pool/botnet to give myself ~20-25% share of the network, and then I would initiate the attack by taking down the other big pools, thus gaining &gt;50% of the computing power.
This would be by far the most feasible attack, but it definitely could not last more than a couple of blocks.
@_date: 2012-02-04 00:04:32
It is impossible to split the blockchain past the last checkpoint. It's hard-coded.
You can delay mining significantly in a couple ways, although I'm not sure if they've patched them. One is (or used to be) submitting a block with a future timestamp. I'm not sure what you would do with that time, but with 51%+, there's many ways to stretch it to 24 hours. A much more costly and unfeasible way would be to DoS enough nodes that new blocks can't be announced.
If you do not disrupt the network in a noticeable way for a long time, this exploit becomes near impossible to exploit. For example, to solve your own forked blocks, you will need to take your processing power off the network. People will notice this, unless you were on your own stealth network. If you do have a stealth network with the same processing power as what's online, you can create and release a fork. However, this fork will skip checking only for people who haven't been connected in the last day (newcomers, occasional users).
Edit: And so the bitcoin devs would release a new client with the "good" blockchain hard-coded in as a checkpoint. Although it won't stop you from attacking again, you probably will only be destroying value. Which is not that helpful unless you've developed a financial instrument to go double-short bitcoin.

Assuming the average person is a law-abiding citizen with a job and a residence, AML is not terrible or inconvenient*. You're going to need to qualify with me what exactly is so difficult. Most likely, you are unwilling to submit to the AML process? Perhaps you simply can't because you are still a minor? 
Simply put, if you don't want to submit to AML to get to the cheapest service (b/c it is lawful and safe for your middleman), then you need to pay a different cost. This could be eating the fees BitInstant, taking a risk with a newer, less proven competitor, going through the inconvenience of exchanging bitcoins in person, or receiving less than full value via bartering with gift cards on the bitcointalk forums.

1. I'd say no, but different people have different ideas of prudence. You can probably take steps to make your transactions secure from hackers, but you are somewhat at the mercy of volatility and volume problems. If I was starting from step 0, I would pressure my bank(s) to see if they can be more convenient.
2. A variety of [choices]( here. 
3. One of the reasons why I say it isn't prudent is the possibility of volatility. I assume you will do your EUR &gt; BTC &gt; CAD exchange promptly, but it's still going to be in BTC for maybe 12+ hours and will be subject to daily fluctuations.

Someone break this down for me in terms a person who buys "bernanke" bonds would understand.
Because if I look at a company and their bond coupon is going up, I think it is going down the shitter.

@_date: 2012-12-18 21:53:31
Is there a bitcointalk thread I can follow about this?
If I am reading this structure right, it is best put like this:
Losses are distributed to creditors via "bonds" in a one-time "coupon"
The coupon is determined *after* maturation
Profits are distributed to shareholders via "shares" in a monthly "dividend"
There is one class of "stock", and no stock owner has voting rights or any influence over equity.
Good thing there is this disclaimer:
"3 Both “stocks” and “bonds” as used in this discussion are logically derived from the same root as their everyday equivalents, but do not function exactly alike. It is very important to read carefully and fully grasp the specifications of their working as described here, and it is very dangerous to rely on the theory that you understand based on your general experience with other stocks or bonds."

I came into reading this interview wanting to know one question.
"Why was the GLBSE shutdown so disorderly?"
The answer I gather, essentially, was "I suddenly realized that GLBSE had legal concerns that *I* was not willing to risk"
If he had legal concerns, he should have resigned from his position and possibly cautioned the board/shareholders to wind down GLBSE rather than continue. If he didn't have legal concerns at the time of his resignation, he wouldn't get any. If he did, then resignation would still be the end of any future legal problems.

On one hand, I want to point them to the right place. On the other hand, I worry that they're going to get their shit jacked if they can't find how to buy bitcoins by themselves. We don't need *everyone* to know a lot about the inner-workings of bitcoins, but we do need people to be able to find sidebars or google "canadian bitcoin exchange", "CAD BTC exchange", or "CAD to BTC". If they can't, how likely is it they'll find out about wallet encryption, reputation, transaction verification, and other concepts needed to actually use their bitcoins?
@_date: 2012-09-24 17:32:58
OP, based on what I've read so far, I am telling you that you are not following very easy to follow advice.
Buying BTC isn't like buying WoW gold or facebook credits; It's like buying unmarked, unordered Euros. Imagine if you go to r/finance and ask why it is so hard for someone to mail you some unmarked, unordered Euros.
If you are a minor or foul of the law, which I think are the only plausible non-trolling explanations, you need to try local bitcoins or become tech-savvy enough to mine your own.

1) It's definitely feasible even without a wallet. Typically when trading on bitcointalk, my transactions hit the network in seconds. Regardless, "To be responsive" does not mean you have to wait for even 0 confirmations, just to acknowledge and have faith that it occurred. If you want to give them the item/game right away, then make a way revoke their purchase if it was fraudulent (which Steam essentially already does).
2) A major issue that no one has mentioned here is that legitimate companies get in trouble with governments for not knowing their buyers. If someone pays with Bitcoin, are they money laundering? And who gets the tax receipts?
I think the first "big" non-profit that starts using Bitcoin will likely still require a credit card for verification.

We were never in any danger because of the 50% safeguard. Suppose someone had the capability of breaching that threshold. To exploit this bug, they would need to use that power to keep blocks from getting onto the blockchain for ~24 hours so that they could get their full 24 hour fork into clients at once. This would let us know that they were malicious, and 24 hours should hopefully be more than enough to deal with them.
Even if they succeed, if the developers manage to release a new client that rolls back bitcoin spending to the pre-attack fork, and convince/fix enough miners/pools to rectify the 51% issue, you would not lose your bitcoins (although with such a scare, bitcoin's value would probably plummet).

For me, the central purpose of a bank (despite the fact that most users of a bank would actually say it is something else) is to connect those with an excess of capital to those in need of capital. In that respect, there are many operations that look like banks being set up in the bitcointalk lending activities forum. Probably at least one is legitimate.

Assuming/pretending they are legit, this render means nothing to their competitors. They don't have the design file from which this render was made. Even if they had stolen the ASICs somehow, they'd have to figure out what values all the discrete components on that render are.
The actual R&amp;D intensive portion of the board (~95%) is in the ASIC.
Edit: To make myself more clear, if you sent this picture to a PCB manufacturer they would laugh at you for being clueless. If you sent the *design file*, then yes.
I would also like to further add that I do not recognize what software they used to render this. It does not seem to be built into typical IDEs for PCB design.

Hindsight is 20/20. I can see GLBSE shareholders thinking that if Nefario ran into legal trouble, surely he would be allowed to resign and have someone else take his place.

I don't like BIP 101. I really don't like that people are putting out a client for it. But if ~70% of users/miners/ecosystem think it's a good idea and YOLOFORK to it, etc., then it will eventually be in the reference client one way or another.
Mods, perhaps it is time to rethink what we consider "the bitcoin protocol". Maybe consider Bitcoin to be the client that is building the strongest (most irreversible) blockchain.
TL;DR Mods should rethink Bitcoin. Plenty of rationalizations that will let BIP 101 discussion run its course.

This is actually super interesting for those of us excited about Bitcoin as a payment network. Here we have "CoinbaseCoin" competing with Bitcoin processed by Bitpay and the premium is with Bitcoin!
If Coinbase starts being more widely used, but needs to turn a profit, what's going to happen? I'd expect there to be a fee and premium for using Coinbase. And that premium would be a decent proxy for how much trust we put on Coinbase for providing us with a convenient and reliable payment network.

Liberal dream? How are these constitutionally-backed reasons?
I pay taxes to
- establish justice
- insure domestic tranquility
- promote the general welfare
- provide for the common defense
- secure the blessings of liberty
Granted, the government is not doing most of those very well, but, to me, that's a reason to either fire it or renounce citizenship. Taxation is only theft when the government gives you no other options. Here in the United States, somewhat due to our powerful position, we at least enjoy the freedom to expatriate ourselves.

I don't think there is enough demand where you can just set up a stand, but go to localbitcoin.com and see for yourself. Type in your zip and if there are some "buy" ads, you may have a chance.
Otherwise, I'd just use localbitcoins to find buyers. You only need it to make first contact and then go from there. If you have enough buyers, you can set up your stand. Although, I have to say, some of your buyers might prefer anonymity or pseudo-anonymity and would not like to come to a possibly-monitored stand to get their coins. Once you get to know a couple, you'll get a sense of things.
Edit: Also, if FINCEN actually makes real rulings about Bitcoins, your stand idea goes kaput instantly because you are an MSB.

The first two questions are answered by "the Bitcoin protocol" which users agree to implicitly and miners enforce explicitly. "They" can change the protocol to create more, but "they" are heavily incentivized not to. After a significant protocol change (a hard-fork), it's a question of branding and semantics whether or not the new protocol can still be called "Bitcoin".
"They" is some significant majority of users and miners. Typically thought of as &gt;95%.

Just let the Litecoin experiment play out. It's worth explaining the demerits like Erik Vorhees did and ultimately the users (meaning developers, merchants, the whole infrastructure) should be swayed to focus on Bitcoin as the rationally better choice.
If it's a good idea we deserve to be surpassed by it. If it's a bad idea, we will win out. If it's a terrible and mutually destructive idea, Bitcoin still does not deserve to survive for being vulnerable to such an "attack". If it's a parasite we can't be rid of, that's fine too; look at all the dumb stuff people buy into, and you can't stop them from doing it.

That's also simply not something you can state without proof. As a counterexample: The difficulty rose steadily in 2012, but minimum/average transaction fees did not correlate in a statistically significant way. Why? There simple were not enough legitimate transactions to fill up a block. Depending on who you talk to (S.DICE), there still isn't. If there are more hardware breakthroughs, there exists the small possibility that there might never be.
A more in-depth counterexample: Increases in difficulty reduces the parties who are mining to those with lower costs of electricity and more reliable hardware. There is no block reward, and there is just enough competition to hit the blocksize limit. Ceteris paribus, the parties who are mining will arrive at a lower minimum fee because they can still be profitable with it.
Define your problems correctly, and while confounding variables (the future) will get in the way, your answer will still more closely reflect the situation.

Sure, I was just too lazy to look up the background information. When you are mining, you are hashing against this: 
The part that prevents you from cheating is this:
hashMerkleRoot	256-bit hash based on all of the transactions in the block	
since the first transaction in a block is 25 new btc to an address, if you start hashing towards your address (1st transaction = 25BTC -&gt; You), the mining pool will not accept your work. On the other hand, if you submit the problem based on the work the pool gives you, the reward goes to the pool since the ledger says 25 BTC -&gt; Pool.

If you are doing cost benefit analysis of buying BFL against just holding BTC instead, you are indeed never getting RoI.

I agree with your title and I think this making it to the top is a sign that the price-induced mania is slowly leaving the system.
I'll answer your assertion about high prices with an extended example:
A valuable money supply is resistant to volatility from manipulation.
For example, I give you a billion USD on loan, and I will let you keep it only if you can make:
A) A gallon of milk cost 10 times as much in USD, the world's reserve currency.
B) A gallon of milk cost 10 times as much in Zimbabwe Dollars, the world's most hilarious currency.
Barring political shenanigans, you'd try to do B because you could buy up much more of the money supply. Now, replace A with "Bitcoins in 2013" and B with "Bitcoins in 2009".

[printcoins]( is still around. I was thinking of starting a competitor recently. I don't think they would mind as it would help with "decentralization".
Going back to that, from my perspective:
The main benefit of printcoins over these is that it is decentralized. This means that if the government goes apeshit over exchanging cash for bitcoins without an MSB, printcoins is not really going to suffer -- whoever currently holds the bills will just peel off the holograph and go completely digital again. With these cards, as with all gift cards, you better hope the issuer doesn't fold.
The main benefit of these over printcoins is that it is way easier to have a newbie start using. Just go to the website, get your coins, and figure it out as you go.

My positions (To Bitcoiners, I am a "Keynesian Statist"):
- The government is not going to take kindly to the casual tax evasion espoused on this sub-reddit. Citizens are not going to take kindly to the 1% using Bitcoins to evade taxes. This being said, it is reasonable not to pay taxes until governments make a ruling on what Bitcoin is. Starting with currency vs. commodity and foreign vs. local.
- Paying taxes is your contribution to the state. Services are what you get from the state. Even Ayn Rand's ideal state provides service (a military to ward off hostile states). Disagreement with the services your state provides may be a good reason not to pay your taxes, but it is not a legal one. [See here](

I am an EE and I can confirm this is essentially true. There might be a handful of people in the whole world who know the fundamentals of all aspects of asic production. Design is probably op's actual interest. Basic ASIC design can be learned in a few weeks with the right mathematical and programming background. Look for introductory Verilog and VHDL courses to jump in. However, an asic that does sha256 double hashes will take a little more education, an efficient design will need some more, and getting it tested and developed will take tremendous capital.

Step  Don't tell anyone how many Bitcoins you have so they don't try to steal it!
I think using big exchanges + Coinbase + blockchain.info to store a few coins is not a bad idea. It's also much more liquid. Those sites have two-factor authentication and are the least likely of all Bitcoin sites to run away with your money.
But to answer your question, I think that an offline wallet with a backup and the private key secured by an implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm will work well.
Keep in mind that the people you trust have to know which implementation you used and how many codes they need (or successfully good at both of these). Oh, and to be safe, you can't give them these codes via e-mail. So it is a little bit tricky.
So, one way to do this currently is to make your offline wallet, get SSSS (a Shamir's implementation) on an offline Linux machine, generate your codes, and print them out with an offline printer.
I think armory is coming up with their own internal implementation of SSSA to make this work.

Hey you! I've been working on pinning down my thoughts about Bitcoin and Christianity in essay format, so I can provide some help. For expediency, all points made below are done from my own perspective, so don't downvote because it's religious.
First, don't tell people to convert to the Church of Bitcoin. Bitcoin, like all other forms of money, is a false idol. The love of Bitcoin is at the root of all kinds of evil.
Second, like all other forms of money, Bitcoin is a tool in the hands of agents, so while agents can do good with it, you have to admit that many or most of the agents using Bitcoin are currently "bad". Both in terms of undermining the authority of the state, and in undermining the higher moral laws of God. At the end of the day, it is a tool, like money, and it is in the responsibility of actors to use it for good.
You are right in that Bitcoin "kicks the money lenders out of the temple", but perhaps don't know why that is important. It is important because the state-supported money lenders had goals contrary to the commands of God. I'd prefer to explain the message of the currency using the [render unto caesar]( passage. When enjoying the privilege of using the British pound and the American dollar, we bear responsibility for the state's actions. This is usually clear to us in the financial sense at tax time. With Bitcoin, you have freedom in this respect to render unto God what is rightfully his. (Although if you enjoy other privileges that a state provides, you still need to bear moral and tax responsibilities for those).

As someone who has been mining for awhile and spotted BFL for what it is for awhile too, I would actually advise people not to buy anything *now*. If they get in trouble and have a fire sale, or when the bitcoin mining space becomes more focused on orders and not preorders, I would take a second look at BFL's offerings. I'm highly skeptical they will change their ways, but the Bitcoin arena is full of the unexpected.

In my opinion, a lot of people are not willing to change their opinion based on new information and admit they might be wrong, so they are doubling down.
If you look through my post history you will find that I was fairly certain that BFL was a scam. With the arrival of Avalon ASICs, I began to think they might be legitimate. Now, I think there is a fairly decent chance they are legitimate and just have unrealistic timelines and incompetent PR.
My position is still that a working chip is the most important/expensive part, and if you can demonstrate that the chip is working, you are legitimate enough to order from.

Hrrrrngh. Well, I guess in the interest of explaining the cryptography of Bitcoin while I have laymens' attention:
First, there is a high likelihood that SHA-2 will be weakened in the future, and even a small likelihood it will eventually be "broken".
The people who would actually lose out the most on this would be miners with their ASICs, as new ASICs would come out that are much faster (or efficient, if that's what important at the time) because they will exploit the weakness to hash faster.
Private keys are protected by a combination of SHA-2, RIPEMD-160, and ECDSA. We trust the developers and miners to determine if these three have been weakened enough to hardfork to a new algorithm. They have financial incentive to fix things. Otherwise, if it's just a minor exploit, things will carry on as usual.
TL;DR FUD

I can't imagine what made you think this; Please link the threads so I can examine them.
That being said, Bitcoin is very resistant against attacks because it uses multiple families of cryptography. When it becomes publicly known that one family is being weakened (which usually happens before a complete breakthrough), there is time to transition.
If you go and investigate the OP's links, you'll find that quantum computing will break EDCSA completely, but you will still be okay if you don't reuse addresses (which was Satoshi's recommendation, but it means no vanity addresses). Again, this is because Bitcoin uses multiple cryptographic schemes. In this case, Bitcoin hashes your public key to create addresses and it is not known until you sign a transaction.

Have any of you people sad about this actually mined on MTRED? It was down 1/3 of the time when I switched away and only used it as a backup pool. Their downtimes were the first things to make me apply the concept of backup pools. They also started supporting NMC merged mining, and then didn't for a reason I'm not aware of. Support was going to the mtred subreddit and seeing if it was down for anyone else. 
They get credit for being one of the first zero-fee PPS pools, but it simply was not economical for either the miners or rex at the end. I like the idea of a reddit mining team too, but the execution needs to be better.

1) There are idiots and there are genuine investors in there who are disagreeing with you. There are also speculators who are interested.
2) Bitcoin is a "speculative" investment. If you do not think so, lay out certain general investment criteria that you think will prove its value over other investments. You do not have to post these criteria to the public, but be honest to yourself about them.
3) Bitcoin's "market cap" (we use that term even though it is not a stock) makes it an incredibly small company.

Interesting. As a bit of a fatalist, I can't disagree with your point that ASIC mining hardware had to develop the way it did. I myself was surprised by a few things in retrospect: the most surprising thing was how it succeeded despite the entrepreneurs giving out minimal credentials and personal information.
However, I think it's not ridiculous to support people who are outraged at BFL (and now, Avalon). It's the idea of meeting expectations. Ultimately, I always think the buyer is responsible for knowing what he has bought, but I will pressure sellers to be honest, or face the loss of my "goodwill" towards them.

Look, I agree that the feasibility is on the same order as a 51% attack. You have essentially become that nonexistent "market manipulator". 
However, the reason for the "firepower" is to move the market into compliance by financial, and not political, force. If their floating exchange rate drops any significant amount below the peg, arbitrage bots will buy at the exchange and sell to you.
The reason this can be profitable is that when the price rises, you can hold the peg until you've sold off all the coins (or more) that you bought at the peg price.
100MM USD, 1M BTC firepower, peg = $100
A "panic sell" happens, but you have enough firepower. Once it is over, you repeg to $105.
10MM USD, 1.9M BTC, peg = $105
Over the next couple of days, people realize a "panic sell" happened, and buy back in.
100MM USD, 1.043M BTC, peg = $105
You will notice there are a lot of assumptions in there, and those assumptions happen to fail very often. There is rarely enough firepower to stop a full-fledged bubble/panic. *That* is why I am saying it is hard to do.

Sometimes I wish I could have my mind wiped and rediscover Bitcoin again just so that I could understand how people miss information like this which was obvious when I started.
If there is enough demand for it, someone will make a client which prunes the block chain and only downloads a much smaller amount of data. The Bitcoin block chain is organized in a way (Merkle treee), such  that a client for a wallet is capable of ignoring much of the data on it.
As for the size of actual blocks, I don't think we need to be able to include more bandwidth either, right now. We'll just start leaving micro-transactions unconfirmed. Free micro transactions does not have to be a key feature of Bitcoin.

This exposes a fundamental "feature" of inflationary fiat currency that most Bitcoin-ers and many people disagree with. I assume that by asking this question, you know that inflationary currencies lose value the longer you hold it. I would call *this* unfair because you have to actively move your assets into investments. Those who are not knowledgeable or unwise often fail to successfully transfer their assets into productive investments.
Also, as many people here are saying, the value of Bitcoins is not going to go up linearly, and some don't think that will ever happen. Don't assume that the value of Bitcoins will go up, especially not right now.
@_date: 2013-04-19 21:37:07
I am not so worried.


A fiat currency of a trustworthy government will be more valuable to me than Bitcoin. I believe Bitcoin to be neutral monetary policy. Good monetary policy will beat it out. In a possible future, I could see a small nation pegging their currency between 7.7-7.8 microbits to give their competent central bankers some freedom to speed up and cool down their economy while giving their currency some legitimacy. 


Grandma will be okay if she raised her kids to take care of her. If "grandma" didn't raise kids, she better be smart. Maybe she dies because she isn't. Not all societies have contracts that say you are entitled to retirement. If future societies do not have this feature, she should not expect it.


If you are worried about people suffering due to increasing wealth disparity, that will probably happen with or without Bitcoin. With Bitcoin, at least we do not have to "game" inflation. Furthermore, like all currencies, Bitcoin only has power because people accept it. If people do not consent to transact in Bitcoin, and instead use another cryptocurrency to rebel against the new ruling class, we will quickly see wealth redistribution.


Where governments do not collapse, neither will law enforcement. Where governments collapse, people will either create a new government or suffer weak law enforcement. This is already true everywhere.

Obvious to me that she's making some risky assumptions with that argument. The big assumption of course is that having access to regulated financial institutions is necessary to Bitcoin's survival. 
Well, it seems like it's important to the survival of the big exchanges (and Coinbase) which provide a lot of the liquidity needed to convert fiat into bitcoin. But even if you successfully argue that it's vital to their survival, their survival may not be necessary for Bitcoin's survival. 
Are we able to get large amounts of worth in and out of Bitcoin some other way easily if these high volume fiat exchanges don't exist? I think there are plenty of ways to do so. 
But I'm not against compliance. Let's experiment. I don't care if I'm wrong, but it's going to suck for Megan. Here's what I think:
Companies like CoinX will probably love regulation at first because there'll have access to big markets of wealth and get a big cut out of a wealth transfer to Bitcoin. We'll probably love it too because the value of Bitcoin will go up. But then compliance will probably get harder, and political. Only the companies with political connections (and, ok, savvy leadership) will survive. Meanwhile, maybe Bitcoin's price is going down because it's losing some liquidity (ceteris paribus, that would be the case, but ceteris paribus is a big caveat). But as long as it's liquid in another direction (as I pointed out earlier), it won't die or even suffer a large drop in value.
If you're looking for some empirical evidence to my reasoning, I'd point to gold with a focus on its use as a commodity currency. It's survived all kinds of regulations (yes, mostly stupid) that attempted to debase its utility as money, and it's not nearly as easy to hide and move as Bitcoin.

In my experience, it is not lucrative to work out details to a resolvable low priority problem until it becomes higher priority. The entire future is unknown territory. Furthermore, it is important to keep your issues separate to keep them manageable.
1) Default client bitcoin-qt 7.? takes too long to download the blockchain because it is slow writing to disk. This is being dealt with by the next version.
2) Block chain grows too large to store. This will be dealt with by pruning.
3) When most of the world is on thin clients, miners in P2Pool and one miner in every pool will still have the whole blockchain. Their motivation will either be new bitcoins or transaction fees. If we are not satisfied that this is safe enough, we will change the protocol to give them more new bitcoins or require bigger transaction  fees or some other solution.

Guys, read the article and calm down a little. It's still a bad idea, but he hasn't gone crazy. He's proposing a moving peg set by the Bitcoin foundation. 
The problem is that the foundation has neither the desire, firepower, or authority to do this. There's no desire because it isn't their goal, there's relatively little firepower because they don't have the assets to move the market towards their peg, and there's relatively little authority to do so because we have a peer-to-peer currency (also because they can't manufacture either USD or BTC).
But yes, someone with the will, and say... 30% of Bitcoin and 100 million dollars, could probably try to publicly peg Bitcoin daily. In fact, they'd probably profit from successfully doing so.

I think Adam usually has a little more airtime to voice his thoughts and he just didn't have the right soundbites. His life doesn't really revolve around Bitcoin, so the stereotypes we're all sick of (Silk road, angry Libertarian, anonymous hackers) seem appropriate to him. 
I'd like to point out that twitter feedback was generally favorable... except for the circulating retweet about him being beholden to big banks.

How afraid should we be?
Market segmentation is not currently an issue because we have the most adopted cryptocurrency by far.
When a cryptocurrency is succesfully pegged (perhaps to another), there is going to be a strong power pegging it. Whether that is because it is pre-mined, debasable, or enforced by regulation, that's really all you can say. 
A successful peg will obviously be more stable.

Look, you seem pretty smart, and now I am at a computer, so I will try one more time. If you buy all but 1$Z and you are a bad actor, the remaining 1$Z will buy nothing because people will not accept it as currency. Somewhere between buying up say... 50% and all but 1$Z, prices will rise due to the currency beginning to be worthless. Yes, this is all without free market interventions.
Let me reiterate that you are imagining things from the rational actor perspective and then making big dreams from that when the hypothetical isn't about making money but about destroying a currency via manipulation.
If you somehow attain all but 1 Bitcoin and refuse to spend it then nobody would give the last Bitcoin much value, knowing you could nuke them hard with "inflation". If they still saw cryptocurrencies as valuable, they would most definitely use an altcoin.
If you only bought up 10% of all Bitcoins perse, slowly, over a few months, due to a rational belief in Bitcoin, yes prices will fall. Yes/But *You do not win the hypothetical from the prices falling*. You hypothetically get fired by your bad actor boss who wanted Bitcoin to fail so that Western Union could keep making money.

I don't think they've started shipping in any decent quantities yet. Due to the slow shipping, people have been griping that media in effect "stole" their miners (which is justifiable). Also see this: 
So you might want to estimate what is the cost of this additional time. That is impossible to tell, but a crowd-sourced estimate is to see how much an early order jalapeno is selling on bitcointalk.  The forum thinks that roughly 30-some bitcoins worth of hashing @ 5GH/s will be done before BFL gets to your order. Given a flat .20/BTC a day (which is wildly optimistic), they think there's a 4 month backlog.

Poor imagination, and there's no need to slander people who disagree with you. Caveat Emptor is essential in Bitcoin.

Well, it was a reaction to your comment, which I felt was a reasonable assessment of how defensive we are about Bitcoins. I also find your follow up to be a reasonable statement. I like Buffett's folky explanations: Inflationary tools and basic financial services help grow the pie so everyone can get more (Translation: Economics isn't a zero-sum game). However, a lot of the financial products we have now aren't actually growing the pie so much as taking a bigger share of it.

I have not said whether democracy or voting is legitimate (whatever that means). I have no especial love for either, and you will find my thoughts on them similar to the ones outlined in Thoreau's Civil Disobedience. 
I tell people to exercise their conscience, and so I do not agree that people should ever shut up. If their conscience demands it, they should *protest, not evade,* taxes. To paint a picture for you: Think how the tax protester in jail must view the "morally-inclined" tax evader; As a coward who will not grasp the chance to hasten the end of an unjust government. As a person who jails his conscience in order to be "free".
 
I will also maintain that in the United States of America, it is the easiest it has ever been to become unencumbered with your responsibilities as a citizen and cut ties with the state.

Firstly, we are being put to good use. Back when I first started bitcoin mining, I tried to explain it to my friend and didn't do it very well. To explain what's going on, we are NOT doing this for charity and we are not wasting electricity, it's a very important business. We are *securing transactions on the public ledger*. In a theoretical world with no miners, anyone could come in and block all transactions from being recorded.
The way the Bitcoin protocol is, there is no way that processing power can be used to solve SETI problems specifically. This is because bitcoin miners are doing the repetitive task of hashing, whereas SETI will be doing more complex calculations (which suits a CPU) and is a very different set of tasks.
Edit: However, conceptually, a "proof of work" currency that just also happens to solve scientific problems is conceivable. You must design a fair way to distribute rewards for work though.

A few words of encouragement about your hesitancy:
It took me a lot of time to really start using bitcoin. [Take a look at this address]( I recognized bitcoin's utility only days before the first input in June 2011, and it took me 6-7 months of thinking and reading to start mining/buying them in bulk. If you go to bitcointalk, you'll discover it took me over a year from discovery before I started posting.
On these forums, you will often see people worry about starting out, or belabor the fact that they didn't buy coins sooner. They don't realize that even if they don't have coins, they're ahead on the learning curve. Take your time. Grab some millibits from faucets. Start setting up your Dwolla and exchange accounts in case you want to buy a few coins. Come here, go to IRC, and go to bitcointalk and ask your questions. There's no reason to leap in all at once.

Uhh... nope. Same inflation curve, lagged by 2 years. If we really want to, we can just call every .25 BTC = 1 nBTC (new Bitcoin).


is implemented poorly and so is not GPU (and ASIC) proof. It is hardly ASIC resistant.


Nope. ~~4 LTC confirmations has same security as 1 BTC confirmation~~. Regardless, 10 mins is unacceptable for large purchases, whereas no one is likely to double-spend on small ones anyway. Sellers have been more than happy to release the goods to me after seeing the transactions hit blockchain.info.


That's not an issue.
I'm not saying that Litecoin will die. Ultimately it is up to "the users" which cryptocurrency/ies will be adopted. I have my own appreciation for Litecoin (in a way it's got a fairer distribution), but it does not solve any of the problems above.

In response to a deleted comment:
Most of this is true. I also erred on the conservative side which favors Avalon. 
In reality, my estimate is for *less than* 10 months but more like 8. This is because you have to add the remaining value of the BFL machine at "the point at which the total hashrate makes the Avalon machine worthless".
Today: A,B are mining. B generates 200 in profit, A generates 150
6 months pass with revenue and profits declining
B now generates 50 in profit, A 0. 
A shuts down. B continues.
Not only has B generated $300 more during the 6 mo period, it has the profits left from its remaining lifespan.

As compared to hashrate, energy usage is relatively easy to account for when looking to see if it makes financial sense. The cost will be (difference in wattage from competition)(local cost of electricity)(time period of comparison). 
This will be eating into your profit/operating margin which is determined by the more complicated revenue side and your machine's percentage of total network hashes.
Assuming that mining is profitable, the cost to you will be about (24h)(540w(13c per KWH)(30) = $50 USD a month. 
If BFL actually has a product that generates comparable hashes, one would reason that it would be worth ~$500 more than Avalon's product, depending on how heavily you discount cashflow and depreciation.

I assume you are just talking about pooled mining because it doesn't have to be a PPS pool, just any pool where you are being sent work.

Your hash which solves the problem won't work unless you address the newly minted coins to the pool operator.

Can't believe this post gets upvotes and you get downvotes. Just a rant with absolutely nothing constructive to say about how we could improve Bitcoin/fiat conversions.
If it was such a simple task converting everyone's idea of money (CC, Debit, ACH, Paypal, cash X USD/EUR/JPY/CAD/) into bitcoins, someone would have already done a better job of it and taken all the business. 
I don't know why these people don't think about how *they* would do it before going off.

I think I've had this discussion before and it may just be a matter of semantics. The protocol itself will not survive, so if Bitcoin is simply the protocol, then "Bitcoin" dies. However, like you said, we should be able to gather a majority of people and consent to a change of protocol while keeping all the great features of Bitcoin.

The difference is in the title and about meeting expectations. If you donate direct, you won't have the question of whether a website is going to take a slice of the funds one way or another. You can equate it to investing directly over a pass-through; Peace of mind that the pass-through won't take a cut. There are tons of "charities" in the real world that are really just tax havens or serve other purposes, and you can google the problem if you don't believe something so cynical could ever happen.

Nope, but keep an open mind about it and its features. If you're worried about the market cap, currencies don't have "market caps". What you're seeing is supply (of tradable XRP) being kept low while demand rises. Kind of anathema to Bitcoins, but it's not like it's violating some law of the universe.

To be honest, I think it's a very frustrating time as a Bitcoiner. We are assailed on many sides by people looking to get or stay rich without doing something productive.
There are the Bitcoin speculators themselves. I don't count "hoarders" among these. I mean the traders, and really just the ones spreading FUD (price discovery is OK in my book).
Then there are the rising alt-coin currencies that seem to be either parasitical or mutually destructive.

As a long time reader of Bitcoin forums; my sympathies. If he were my friend/son/loved one I wouldn't be able to decide whether I would want him to lose his money and learn a valuable lesson or be successful and get his car.
To answer your only question, it really depends if he knows what he is doing. You shouldn't try to withdraw into fiat from the MTGOX bitcoin exchange, for example, because they are having some issues with their bank. Foreign exchanges that transfer 10k+ to your bank account will also trigger some anti-money laundering watches. The other problem is taxes; we don't have a good idea how profits are taxed. If you are in the U.S., my opinion is that it's probably hobby tax and conversion to fiat is the taxable event unless you're just doing currency exchange. I am not an accountant, and there are few laws about this.
If you want to learn more about Bitcoin, we have "Moronic Mondays" tomorrow, where you can ask any questions you want. 
If you want my opinion on the best thing you can do for your son; You have to pay quite a premium to short Bitcoins due to volatility, so that's not really an option. The best way you can watch out for him is to make sure he has properly secured his Bitcoins; You can ask questions about that on Moronic Monday.

I don't like this because I don't think the motives for change are strong enough. To me, MTGOX works. By this, I mean it does everything I need it to do. Secure platform. I can transfer money in, I can get Bitcoins out.
Now, I believe Coinlab probably works for me, and they will probably even implement features that I'd want (Built-in stop loss? I'd try it). But of course, now I have to wait and see. I will have to examine all over their ToS, security, and processes. We shall see.

Copy pasta from another reply:
Look, I agree that the feasibility is on the same order as a 51% attack. You have essentially become that nonexistent "market manipulator".
However, the reason for the "firepower" is to move the market into compliance by financial, and not political, force. If their floating exchange rate drops any significant amount below the peg, arbitrage bots will buy at the exchange and sell to you.
The reason this can be profitable is that when the price rises, you can hold the peg until you've sold off all the coins (or more) that you bought at the peg price.
Ex. 100MM USD, 1M BTC firepower, peg = $100
A "panic sell" happens, but you have enough firepower. Once it is over, you repeg to $105.
10MM USD, 1.9M BTC, peg = $105
Over the next couple of days, people realize a "panic sell" happened, and buy back in.
100MM USD, 1.043M BTC, peg = $105
You will notice there are a lot of assumptions in there, and those assumptions happen to fail very often. There is rarely enough firepower to stop a full-fledged bubble/panic. That is why I am saying it is hard to do.

Author is clearly familiar with the Bitcoin space and brings up old Bitcoin arguments.
I'm not sure what journal(s) declined to publish this article, but I can see how the justification given was appropriate (not novel). 
Some of it is also not well thought out. Take, for instance, the argument that Bitcoin cannot support fractional reserve banking. According to the author, it can't because we would have to trust a bank with the new "virtual Bitcoins" that they create, and we shouldn't, and there's no reason to.
Really, we're already seeing the possibilities of this and the reasons why. It wouldn't be a surprise to me (but still a disappointment) if MTGOX was already secretly doing "fractional reserve banking". I don't know what the particulars of the reasons are for people "banking" with GOX (convenience of switching to fiat? trusting them more than your own limited technical proficiency? ignorance?), but we're very clearly doing it.

I have an opinion that everyone here should think about. 
Just because Litecoin has no real technological advantage over Bitcoin, doesn't mean that it won't become the dominant currency. At the end of the day, a currency's power base is its users, and if Litecoin or Bitcoin 2.0 or BBQCoin or Ripple attracts more users because a vast majority of the world perceive it to be more fair or are simply motivated by profit, it will become the dominant cryptocurrency.
Litecoin's advantage right now really is a better distribution of wealth to users who are just now being introduced to cryptocurrencies. However, that advantage disappears day by day as the difference in the inflation rates of both currencies drop. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 16:10:31
I am not coinbase but I assume they have a certain amount they deposit into gox each day and spend it on a rolling basis as orders come in. They probably fill your order right away but don't give you the coins because you can reverse the ACH.
This essentially gives them a ~.5% profit margin on total revenue. This is eaten into by paying staff, bugs that cost them money, and dealing with losses when people cancel orders because the price goes down.
Try to see it from their POV.

Surely someone here is thinking "Oh wow, 10-fold is a lot, checkmate Bitcoin". 10-fold is not much at all, and will probably drop with ingenious ASIC designers.
Consider using a GPU on the Bitcoin network vs. the current ASICs and multiply the hashrate by 10x. Would you mine? The answer is still no. 
ASICs that create a skyrocketing hashrate will kill Litecoin GPU mining about as fast as it killed Bitcoin mining.

Ceteris paribus (esp. the price), a lower difficulty means a higher cost of electricity @ which miners go out of business. This is negative feedback.
Also, miners with cheaper electricity do not have a particular incentive to include lower fee transactions. Unless the block size is truly ridiculous, most miners will have the same incentives (the fee) to include each transaction.
Lastly, many people think that in the far future, price will be the biggest driver of difficulty. It may be worth it to consider why.

It would not be a fork. This would be a client that you download, not a change in protocol. It would make the network slightly less secure in that less people are maintaining the integrity of the entire blockchain.
Not for anyone except someone who decides to trust a 0 confirmation microTX that miners would refuse to put in a block.

To be clear, I am not shiftybugger or know him. I tried to make the title as NPOV as possible to see if people would take Coinabul's side. I also am not the one downvoting you.
 found Coinabul's response, past proof of shipment, to be undiplomatic. Shiftybugger did say, however, he was not given proof of shipment, so he was probably embellishing.
 outlines some good business practices, but I am unclear if he understood that the buyer had the option, and chose, to purchase insurance.
 on facts agreed on by both sides, I think that the buyer should be refunded. However, Coinabul doesn't deserve a scammer tag. The deceptive business practice was selling insurance which did not cover the item insured. 
 response to your question about relevance, I think it is worth raising awareness about this. With Bitcoin transactions where the buyer goes first, reputation is the only weapon he has. Caveat Emptor.

One problem people rarely raise is the problem we have distinguishing lost and hibernated coins. This is important because it reduces trust in the system.

You will need to specify the following to get an answer:
- your end currency (HKD or USD)

Increases in difficulty do not directly affect the cost to senders of transactions. The ultimate factor you are looking for is the cost to miners to include your transaction. Other factors used to calculate this are the transactions per second, block size, and available hardware.
Ultimately, the free market should adjust prices fairly. If it turns out Bitcoin is somehow much costlier than BankCash 2.0, then something will happen such as a protocol change or users moving to BankCash 2.0

I'd like to point out that if we return to 100% reserves and a deflationary currency, that the "banks" of the future will be redefined for better or worse. I'm of the opinion that it will draw the line more clearly between commercial and investment banking.
The commercial bank will protect your capital and charge you for it. With Bitcoin of course, you can be your own bank, but there will be plenty of people who don't have the time to deal with the minutiae of creating passwords and sharing algorithms to will away their coins on death.
The investment bank will be for those who want higher returns for taking risks and will work like the investment banks that we have now, except they won't get too big to fail because they can't tie into a threat of commercial bank failure if they go bust.

Which is why I qualified my reasoning. If they're doing a fire sale and giving you the order right away, it would be worth investing. That sounds implausible. Most likely they will probably end up closing up shop when they stop getting customers, and they will stop getting customers because their R&amp;D is terrible and they now have *real* competition. 
But maybe they kept a lot of Bitcoin and benefitted from the price rise. Maybe they don't want to close shop and face possible government action. Maybe they realize that if they do a fire sale of orders (and not preorders), they will just barely break even. It's not inconceivable.

There is no guarantee that no-fee-transactions will be processed "eventually", although this is probably true.

Digital design is the key skill you need in asic design. You learn the foundations for this by knowing the digital hardware framework. Basically everything is run on boolean logic and clock cycles and it helps to know why as you run into problems. You take your basics and learn to do hardware abstraction on VHDL or Verilog. Your virtual debugger is modelsim or something similar. Your physical debugger is an fpga. From here you optimize and do different mapping to fit your design best on an asic.

If they can't give out IP, I might trust evidence that they can make that IP or simply wait for them to produce it.

I am glad to have mined the times I did, and plenty of people have done so too. The majority *did* regret it because of their lack of understanding of the ASIC development process (specifically, what competencies are involved and what lead times are reasonable) or shady vendors. 
It is somewhat frustrating to have people parrot the conclusion that mining is not profitable without realizing that the situation has changed. If you do cost-benefit analysis in Bitcoin, as you should, and you choose correctly, you will earn more Bitcoins from mining than you lay out today. This is the definition of investing.

@_date: 2013-09-13 13:09:51
The premise is completely ridiculous. Let's get the most ridiculous part out of the way: Bitcoin is valuable because it is a medium of exchange and a *store of value*.
Let's get the second most ridiculous part: most of this research is done on 2012 numbers. So, even if it was spot on, it would be estimating the price of bitcoin *in 2012*. SD probably did not do 2M BTC in gambling this year.
Then, there is complete neglect of SD and our exchanges as real businesses. "Bitcoin users" is not some monolithic entity. If you check this reddit in April, you will know, in fact that exchanges provide goods and services because you will see all the posts about bad service. And even if our users were a monolithic entity, BTC is flowing to mtgox, coinbase, SD, etc because of their cut. This cut, as the very least, should count. In other words: discover and add MTGOX's profit to your estimate, and multiply by two.
Lastly, I suspect that local bitcoin economies are not that great, but we can't assume them to be so. I know the Madison group has spent ~$800 in our local restaurants since June. Extrapolating out to the nation, that means local commerce is ~5M a year. Of course, that is a stupid extrapolation (wild guess), but I suppose it is within two orders of magnitude of the wild guesses in this article (/sarcasm).

A valuable money supply (aka high prices) is resistant to volatility from manipulation.
The Zimbabwe Dollar is an existing currency whose money supply is much smaller than the USD. If you buy up the money supply, the price of milk will rise much higher.
You would buy a billion dollars worth of USD by default by accepting the loan. You can change the currency to the Euro or the Pound if you are failing to grasp this and want an actual exchange of currency to occur.
You could try to corner the market on milk, but that's probably harder than buying up Zimbabwe dollars and not the point of the hypothetical.

No, of course that is not their objective. 
However, they do undercut Bitcoin because you can make relatively large transactions relatively quickly.

Everyone says it will get a lot better, but without anything closer in terms of monetary properties, the solutions we have are already closely approaching the bounds of profitability.
Think about the things you are exchanging for bitcoins; They are all missing properties and so require fees/wait periods/inconvenience to offset the trust required to deal with these flaws.

Another thing I've been recently wondering. I've been assuming that GPU power would be shut off and stay shut off once individual miners calculate that their profit margin is no longer acceptable.
However, what appears to be happening is that a great deal of people are selling their GPUs to miners who get "free" electricity, and we aren't losing as much hashing power as I would expect.

I'm too lazy to explore more, but I like the basic concept. As someone has already mentioned, this gives an incentive to ddos pools.
If the price is right, it also gives an incentive to buy a miner and hedge against hash rate devaluing your purchase. Of course, the current way to do that is to sell shares of your miner.

Decent response. I would not call what you are thinking a fantasy although it seems difficult to implement. During the big fork this year, my brother and I started mining to get the 0.7 chain ahead again. On IRC there were also a lot of ex miners asking if they should help. If you could organize some kind of preemptive pool that we can trust to always mine on the "right" chain, it will make organizing these things easier. Lots of work for little gain though.

There's an inclination to make testcoins free so as not to interfere with those who need them for development. But if we can get 15k+ people to test changes by just find/replacing "bitcoin" with "memecoin", I'd take it. It's not serious so they won't mind when we leave for memecoin4.

I think that's a bit too much for a simple explanation and it's also a much less provable claim. Some merchants are not convinced it's useful, they're just joining in on our experiment. I'm especially remembering that an underwhelming amount of Reddit Gold has been bought with BTC. The conclusive results are hardly in.
So I don't think there's much of anything wrong with giving "belief" as a simple explanation of things. I believe the earth revolves around the sun. I believe 1+1=2. Those, I can somewhat prove. I believe in quantum entanglement even though I can't personally prove any of it at all; I trust the people who do. So it is with a lot of these merchants for now.

If your criteria is to make more Bitcoins than you put in (which it should be), you will have to be opportunistic. Some people will make a profit by purchasing specific pieces of hardware at specific times. 
A few weeks ago, when a Cointerra January order was maybe ~7 or 8 BTC was probably one of those opportunities.
The block erupter cube @ now is probably not going to be a profitable choice.
People who say mining is always unprofitable on a Bitcoin cost basis ("you should just buy Bitcoins instead") are oversimplifying, but it does take good judgment to obtain a profit with minimal risk.

In my opinion, Bitcoin is weakest where we can't determine whether coins are lost or just haven't been moved. I would not put the world economy on the back of a currency when I don't know where half of it is.
If the Feds wanted to pass a law, it depends what they want to do. They can outright ban the exchange of Bitcoins for fiat and that would work pretty well as long as they can convince people that Bitcoins are... "evil" (bad for society, dangerous for the economy, or whatever it is that people actually care about). Of course, once you convince people that Bitcoins are "evil" enough, you can pass almost anything to regulate it.

I find this a curious explanation because I also recognize Bitcoin's potential on this front. The monetary policy being set in stone makes it more trustworthy than any government. However, in the near and mid-term I wouldn't expect Bitcoin's price to rise versus a particular currency due to sovereign monetary policy. I expect it to rise in value because of the utility other aspects of its nature provides.
Anyone else have thoughts on this?

You better hope your imagined 0.5% comes to fruition. Back of the envelope, 2% decay, 60 periods = .5 + .25 (2/3) = 67% decay, ~33% of capital remaining. So you'd double back to 66% of starting capital.

I don't really see anything wrong. 66C should be fine. If it isn't, you should see the throttling by watching your gpu usage momentarily drop to 0 in afterburner.
try -d 0 to explicitly tell it to use device 0, which should be your gpu. Also try -d 1 if it isn't the case. If/when the GPU shuts off again, take a look at the log in guiminer to see if there's any errors. However, I'm not sure why else poclbm would switch to your CPU unless it was mining on both CPU and GPU (you don't want that) already because of either an error in setup or a driver bug.
I'd also try bitcointalk / mining forums.

My friend studied Economics at Princeton and is now programming at Google. Not an idiot by far. For all his faults, one of the smartest guys I know. He made the very simple Keynesian argument:

Moving on to your question, if you don't have a localbitcoin or bitcoin-otc rating (to demonstrate trust), what I think is most helpful to non-technical buyers is a working knowledge of Bitcoin. Talk a little about bitcoins with them before asking for the money. Make sure they know to be careful with their coins. Show what happens on your end without sending the coins.

To be specific, to prosecute money laundering in the United States, you have to prove that a person 
1) Obtained money from illicit activities
2) Concealed the money with intent to leave the country*
For more on if 1 is necessary, it is; the US SC has made a very specific ruling on this:
*There are obviously other possible options here as you can launder money without leaving the country.

People keep saying to buy coins by default because of what's happened the past few months. The rise in price means it takes less Bitcoin to buy a miner than it did before. Whereas it took ~30 BTC to buy a miner that generated X Bitcoins a month ago, it takes ~9 now. So if you believed X to be anywhere between 9 and 30, you should be reevaluating.
Of course, not everyone is a parrot, and this news is gradually disseminating, so you should make a decision quickly.
Also, you will need to think about the difficulty rising and when/whether Cointerra will deliver, but those variables have not changed as much in the last few weeks.

These new CGT  claims going around are strange. I've been a proponent of paying taxes before all these mainstream newbies started upvoting these posts. Are you guys sure they are capital gains and not something else?
People have been claiming they should be taxed anything between hobby income and collectibles. How are you so sure this is capital gains specifically?  I'd like to point out that hobby income and collectibles are both taxed much higher than capital gains and there are not lower taxes for holding long term. There is also no such thing as LTCG in forex.
So, are you sure it's going to be treated like stocks? Where has the IRS stated this?
My recommendation remains to keep a ledger and if the IRS will want to backdate their Bitcoin policy to your earnings, then report and pay the appropriate taxes when they come up with regulations.

ELI5: No one knows for certain, but a 5 year old is among the least likely to profit.
The fiscally conservative (like me) recommend not ordering an ASIC for many reasons. We've got some idea of the profit margins because we understand several factors:
* hashing rate
* difficulty
And we can guess with decent results at some factors:
* rate of difficulty increase
The big factor that holds us back is:
* day the ASIC arrives on your doorstep
With Avalon, they have okay communication and a verified product so we can make a guess. With BFL, they have poor communication and no verified product. That day could be July 2013, or it could be July 2014, or it really could be never.

Some people have "free" electricity, so their profit margin never goes down. This is probably why you see people interested in buying graphics cards still on bitcointalk.

-Huh? device 0 (or 1?) on your computer is something that does 900KH/s?
First, only use that flag once. Either -d 0 or -d 1. The device number you should put (-d 0, -d 1, -d X etc.) should be the listed number of your gpu as in the screenshots there. This prevents poclbm from mining on anything besides the specified device, which will also save the first core of your CPU from wasting too much power.
If throttling isn't the problem, and your GPU works if you stop and restart, perhaps your GPU driver may have crashed and done an automatic autorecover? Have you overclocked? 
However, the symptoms of that are that even though you still have graphics, everything you mine is bad, and your hashrate in GUIMiner will probably slowly decline to 0.

The protocol has not been destroyed. The blockchain has not been destroyed. The balance in your address has not even been destroyed. What are you worried about being destroyed?
What has been compromised is the current network's ability to process transactions. In the case of a 51% attack, no transactions can be safely processed until we secure the network against the attacker. If the attack persists through our attempts to resolve it (soft and hard forks), then users will leave. This does not destroy the idea. At most, this puts it to rest while someone thinks of how to improve it.

A ponzi participant can "prove" to others that what they are doing "has value" even though it is an incorrect proof.
Fortunately, Bitcoin is not a Ponzi, and you *can* explain the underlying value. 
I guess what I am saying is this: It's not *bad* to start by proving that it had value for *you* in the years 2011-2013. I don't think that type of reasoning can ever be expanded to prove that "Bitcoin has value as an innovation on money". For *that*, you will need to define for them the properties and functions of money and explain how Bitcoin improves on them.

I will buy FPGAs (and so will others) at dirt cheap prices. The reason is that their power consumption is on the same order of magnitude as the ASICs out there. This means that they will hit unprofitably only when the ASIC margin itself is slim.

I'm noticing a lot of misconceptions about Buffett here. Considering my biggest investments are BRK and BTC, and having read (most of) Security Analysis and Warren Buffett's letters, I feel obligated to try and define what he thinks and probably thinks.
First, WB does not invest outside his circle of competence, no matter how much he thinks the investment will pay off. In fact, he would not qualify putting money outside his circle of competence as "investment" as he could not possibly justify that putting money in something he doesn't understand would make him money. Bitcoin is far outside his circle of competence.
Second, if BTC became big, he probably still would not classify it as an investment, but possibly a place to park his money. Still, it is unlikely he would park it there. It's a currency. Buffett prefers to have a liquid cushion of currency (which, by itself, is not a productive asset), but beyond that he would prefer to keep his "money" in businesses.
Lastly, if WB understood a bit about Bitcoin and Bitcoin businesses, he probably still would not invest. Instead, he would short whatever these rising businesses were killing.

Well, if we're going to have crappy policies that lower velocity and make some people wealthy, why not just go to a currency that makes all people wealthy (via price deflation) instead?

This is more or less right, except the ASIC design process uses the same logic as you would do to test on an FPGA. The logic is then optimized over the idiosyncracies of the design language and placing and routing. However, I have a suspicion the Avalon asic is not very optimized over an fpga (on an absolute basis). It very well may be they took a few days to look over their fpga test design and then compiled it and went with it.
This is because any ASIC going on any modern process is going to blow FPGAs out of the water.

Are you the owner of that slideshow? Because the owner of that slideshow, if he truly devised unique new ways to improve SHA-256 hashing by 38%, should have kept his mouth shut and contacted CoinTerra or someone else who would have loved that IP. I suspect most of these improvements have already been implemented in the 28nm designs coming out now, though.
I also don't know how a 38% improvement in hashing SHA-256 has much to do with whether proof of work is going to die. Or, for that matter, whether we will have to switch algorithms.
@_date: 2013-11-29 10:27:18
no. j/k
our shorthand for the algorithm is sha-256d (double SHA-256 hashes).
The input to the hash function is a series of boring things, probably the most important of which is the "coinbase" with the address where block rewards are sent. This prevents people from mining in a pool and claiming the rewards themselves.
Once the output has a certain # of zeroes at the front (the "difficulty" determines the number), it is a valid hash for submitting the block and claiming the block reward and fees.
The complete documentation is probably on the wiki. If you are looking to write the RTL yourself, it's probably open source on the internet somewhere (haven't checked). You can also reverse engineer how Satoshi did SHA-256d from that open source RTL. I didn't really seek out the details because apparently it is a never-endian headache (pun).

I won't go into the details of this, but under cost benefit analysis done in Bitcoins, some rigs should be worth it now. I'll offer two case studies pulled from real scenarios described to me 
Case Study 
- Bought a November KNCMiner Jupiter in September on CC
- Mark Price in Bitcoins on November 5th, 2 days before CC bill is due. Cost is ~22 BTC
- Estimated Bitcoins generated from default mining.thegenesisblock.com if it arrives December 1st: ~47 BTC
- Profit is ~25 BTC
Case Study 
- Buy a November KNCMiner Jupiter 2 days ago (sold out now)
- Mark to Price ($300/BTC). Cost is ~17 BTC.
- Discount arrival to Dec. 10th with late buy. Revenue: ~30 BTC
- Profit is ~13 BTC

My favorite "feature" of bitcointalk is how you can't show the whole thread after it gets over 20 pages long.
I think some of these criticisms are well deserved, but Theymos has been working on the forums, and there is a bounty out for a proposal that represents a *real* step up.

If you are talking about people "pool jumping" into different mining pools, I think people still jump around the PPS pools. I can explain more about that if necessary.

It would be more fun if I was downvoted less for relatively factual and cited responses, which is why I don't often participate :/
I think one of Thoreau's thoughts was that this is indeed true, and the effect has... strength in numbers. If thousands of people are willing to stand for justice with him, the state would opt to give up the war rather than pay the price of society grinding to a halt.

1t00thfa1rY is going to sell for like 10 million bucks in the future.

Huh, what? I'm just pointing out that we used to talk about whales in BTC before the price rose too high for this to be conceivable in most peoples' opinions. We still don't really know if they were ever there. 
I'm not sure what you're talking about. This seems to me like a random comment under the assumption that everything Litecoin-related in this subreddit has to be negative.

Get a backup yubikey or google auth if you are worried. Mtgox supports this. Learn from my stupidity!

I agree with this, but I do not think many people see it the same way. I'm tempted to call them financially illiterate, but maybe I'm just being anal about semantics.
If you are financially literate and care about using words properly, take a look at how MPOE bonds and stocks work. You will not enjoy what you see.

Meh. I will acknowledge their success upon first customer delivery. I am actually considering gaming their order system if they are sticking with 1/3 shipping. I wonder if all the people buying preorders know their terrible order plan.
I am most amused by the delay in not having the firmware in KC. Not sure what the story there is but it speaks to their competency.

Everyone else on this thread is right, but this is more or less your only hope and I'm not optimistic.

Why downvote?
The only reason this isn't clear-cut money laundering is because we are not sure OP's original money is from illicit activities.

Direct answers to questions like this do not help the OP with a rigorous determination of risk and reward.
First, the typical and obvious basic investing disclaimer applies: Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.
Second, due to the rise in the value of a Bitcoin, almost everyone made a profit mining if they are doing cost benefit analysis to fiat. 
It's not asking a useful question like, "What was your thesis? Was it correct? Does it apply now?"

I also like to mark to market but plenty of accountants like to use book values and other ideas.

Yeah but in op's defense, on a small scale the government will not notice. I'm pretty sure my hearthstone beta key came from a Chinese guy who wrote a bot to harvest them.

Ah! Most everything people have said on here is true. Do any of their features meet what you are looking for?
It is also possible, when generating a new block (not a transaction, a block), to add messages themselves to the blockchain. Satoshi did so, and so did lukejr.

I'm pretty sure that they do want currency control, and let's not disregard the competition so lightly. We usually discuss this from a slightly different angle. We like to say that the bank account is already a digital currency, and it is being distributively (across all banks and the central bank) managed inefficiently, and possibly incompetently.
Fix the efficiency problem with tech, fix the incompetency problem with tech or politics, and you have something people might like.
