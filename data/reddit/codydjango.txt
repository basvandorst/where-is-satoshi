yeah this is surprisingly good!

lol yep that's the one.  I'll keep my searches queries smaller.

I think you were trolled :/
If not trolled then it might be because the language you used.  Conceptually you're pretty much correct on all accounts, but the words you use (tokens, computer system) dont really match up with the popular terms (cryptographic public/private keys, blockchain as global public ledger, decentralised network, etc)
But kudos on explaining using your own mental model.

Thanks.  I won't be going deep on anything for a while (I'm a full-stack web guy already caught up in 50+ hour work weeks).  Right now I'm making my way through "mastering bitcoin".  I think a good primer either on cryptography or distributed programming would be useful.  Or maybe it's better to wait until I have more dedicated time?

Yeah that's my takeaway.  Thanks for the link, I'll start following bitcointalk forum more closely.

You'd still not want to reuse the address.  the hd wallet would just be able to provide a new address whenever you need one, while maintaining it's relation to the branch (which has it's uses).
It seems that if an address becomes public on a network, it becomes available to be hacked using a sufficiently strong quantum computer.  And once the private key is determined, new transactions could be made from that address, effectively stealing bitcoin that might have been sent back to that address.

thanks! I'm not adverse to documentation, it just hadn't come recommended :)

thanks a lot, totally appreciate it.  I have a lot to learn, feel free to post a helpful resource.

hey StayPolite what search terms did you use?
@_date: 2014-08-26 14:43:55
how would this work?  how would trades in general work?  each person would be required to put up some bitcoin up front to a third party, then mail out their vinyl to the other person, then when both confirm that they have received their vinyl the bitcoin is released back to them by the third party?
I'd like to learn more about this -- feel free to suggest resources

no citation is needed; it's a proposed problem, not a fact.  for what it's worth, it comes from here:

I'm a programmer who doesn't know much about the architecture of decentralized services.  It's not the end-user experience I'm wondering about, but how challenging of a task to make the change across the network.  thanks.

cool, wish I could make it!  At least I'll be able to watch the video tomorrow.
@_date: 2014-11-03 05:55:23
seriously?  the only threat to bitcoin is the reuse of addresses?  I'm not sure if you're joking.  There's absolutely no reason for bitcoin to *ever* upgrade it's crypto?  (I'm also not sure if such an upgrade would even be possible.)

F'in _love_ licorice.  This is the best news of today, period.
