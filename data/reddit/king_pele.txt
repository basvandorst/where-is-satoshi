Yesterday night Kraken was working for me about 75% of the time. I was able to make several trades without any issues. But during peak hours, its unusable.

Oh yes its definitely the Kraken servers but I was saying that its kind of weird that they are using such a cheap and sometimes shitty CDN for their website

Half the time when I load the page it shows I have no orders in and then I reload it a few times and they show up.

mBTC legit means millibitcoin so thats 1/1000th. The tip was 1/10,000th of a BTC.

Isn't Cloudflare a free / very cheap CDN? You think they could afford a nicer CDN with all the money they make...

1/1000th of a bitcoin. So they tipped me .1 mBTC or .0001 BTC.

Lol they tipped me so I would go sign up on their website, but its goona take a lot more than .1 mBTC for me to sign up xD

That is exactly what I am doing with kraken. The limit orders execute just fine and then i just transfer instantly to my wallet.

Well from my understanding it used to be pretty good. The Kraken team released a statement today saying that they are overrun with new users and they will be upgrading their servers soon. But who knows how long that will take.

LMFAOOOO I'm dead xD

its the only exchange who has verified me yet so its the only thing I can use right now. I bought a bunch of coins today and I transferred out to a wallet as soon as the website would let me. Quick in and out haha

Damn should have added that
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:20:20
My F5 button has gotten more use today than it ever has before...
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:17:34
It seems like they just need to get their servers under control. With all the money they make from fees they can easily do it.

I got a wallet with toast wallet so I plan on holding somewhat long term unless something tells me otherwise. But I'll check out bitfinex and binance.

I crossed that bridge this morning and now I'm sitting on almost 1k ripple coins ;)

Thats the hardest part about trading. You have to be Spock
@_date: 2019-06-04 18:38:10
Not that I know of, sorry friend :/ there are definitely other ways, just gotta find them.

You can instantly withdraw to PayPal, then instantly withdraw to your debit card. Crypto to physical cash in a few seconds if ur standing in front of an ATM. 
Pretty cool tbh, it would be impossible to do that a few years ago.

Yes, you can connect PayPal to coinbase for instant withdrawal. Sell your bitcoin, then withdraw the USD from your ‘USD Wallet’ to PayPal.
