Yeah, well if he says look at the past couple years the food is hit or miss erratically, what will it be tomorrow? What's your answer?

Hindsight is 2/20. If it went all the way down or all the way up or took forever to move, you could still say the same thing. This is worthless mental masturbation which provides no value to making a decision.

Ahahahah smart people pumped and dumped a couple years ago.
Op is asking about utility of Bitcoin which is it's purpose.
While your aunt may be one example, there are plenty of other 90s comics, beanie babies, pogs, tulips, WeWork, blockbuster, Sears, examples.
The whole preface of Greshams law would be that Bitcoin is the better currency with all of its pros. You admitting fiat is better is antithetical.
@_date: 2019-12-04 12:50:50
Can't defend your nonsensical position, gotcha.
@_date: 2019-12-03 15:44:14
So you're saying the point of Bitcoin is to be lesser of a currency than fiat? Bc if it's better, it would be used per the law quoted. So yeah, there's that.
You either don't understand currency or Gresham's law.

This is correct. Pics of zucks private Hawaiian paradise scream wealth. As a CEO it's not a good look.

This means nothing at face value.
What is per capita debt-as population increases debt increases duh.
what is debt service at current low rates?
100k loan in the 80s ar 17% is moar than 110k loan at 0%.
Why is all news unalytical click bait? If you really thought strongly a crash is imminent, you would sell everything you own and short/buy puts with it all.
Until then, STFU with chicken little end of the world nonsense.

Then look at Japan's and have a heart attack. Also with a declining population exacerbating the problem...you still don't see ppl screaming debtapocalypse

I don't see them having school funding crisis, govt shutdowns, or most "first world problems"...he'll we're well on our way to challenge for the suicide rate crown. My point is you can't look at one metric and make a broad assumption like this alarmist click bait article.

Good thing crypto can't get manipulated like fiat...
@_date: 2019-01-16 21:21:19
As you said, everyone can see the debtpocalypse...but they've been seeing it for 20+ years...so what does a debtpocalypse mean other than academic mental masturbation?
@_date: 2019-01-10 21:58:39
Most cryptos have a finite supply, and should rise in price...
LMFAO good hustle buddy, won't feel sorry for idiots who sell tangible items for digital trash.

Again. You aren't investing in a technology. It's like saying you are investing in the internet bc you bought a modem. It merely allows you access to data. It does not produce anything and even if blockchain becomes the best tech in the world, it has no correlation to btc as anyone can create another. The only people getting wealthy are the creators and exchanges charging fees.
@_date: 2019-01-10 21:56:32
People keep stating the tech is revolutionary.
Which games have been changed?
Which paradigms have been shifted?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:32:10
And what of that is unique to Bitcoin and not 1000's of other cryptos?
@_date: 2019-01-16 17:33:16
"should" and "can" are two completely different things. Bitcoin can be manipulated, internally and externally. No regulation means tradebots can play with prices. If you think this stuff isn't widespread, Google "Bitcoin manipulation"

@_date: 2018-02-05 18:39:17
You don't buy 'internet'. Internet is a medium of which COMPANIES used to scale. Just like Android and apple markets, you invest in companies using this market place for earnings.
Btc isn't a share in a company, it's absolutely nothing. It's not insured, It's not backed by anything. The dollar is backed by a hell of a large GDP tax base and the largest military in the world going on 70 plus years.
Investing in Bitcoin is like buying a 14.4 modem Bev the internet will be awesome in 20 yrs. Btc is already outdated, inefficient, and easily replaced or substituted.
Good luck though
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:33:37
Bc btc is the one many people bought. There is no investment in technology, you are investing in btc and it's Management. If a different coin does it better, which many do, that can easily take over btc, which has been occurring.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:32:56
Curious what your cost basis is and market value. I don't think anyone actually understands what they are investing in. You realize you own nothing, backed by nothing, insured by nothing?
As for 'technology', there is not patent, high transaction fees, slow transaction timing, etc.
How anyone got caught up in this pump n dump hysteria is beyond me.
Good luck though.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:17:52
Usa GDP and tax base is not Fiat. It's an economy. The currency is Fiat, But backing is not, ie GDP, rule of law, and military. Hence full faith and credit of the USA.

How about you bet me 1k that it will?
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:24:47
I still don't get how ppl confuse the technology with value. When you buy Microsoft, you buy a company that obtains patents and creates products etc. And you own a share of the company.
Bitcoin is nothing like that. There is no asset, there is nothing saying the tech can't be replicated ad nauseum, the tech can be abused, etc. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:01:09
Ha I stayed away from it. It wasn't an investment, it was a scheme. I'm joking toward person who said it's a good buy now.

Who wants to trade their lambo for a Ferrari?
@_date: 2018-12-07 05:00:02
Did you seriously just fucking cite someone calling themselves a wizard??
Did you see the little bullshit disclaimer at the end 
How much btc did you buy then and how much have you lost?
If this was remotely true then all you would have to do is buy every positive trend there is bc no matter what you come out ahead...this statement is so retarded.
In the world of money, which is a world shaped by human behavior, nobody has the foggiest notion of what will happen in the future. Mark that word – Nobody! Thus the successful trader does not base moves on what supposedly will happen but reacts instead to what does happen.

You didn't know shit, and still don't. If you did, you would have shorted it with all you could leverage and would be filthy rich.

To be swinging your epeen like this you should back it up.
