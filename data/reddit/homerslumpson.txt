No. Third party votes do not "steal" votes from the main candidates. Infact, in a recent VA election  "an exit poll of Sarvis (Lib) voters showed that they would have voted for McAuliffe (D) by a two-to-one margin over Cucinelli.(R)". So your assertion that the votes come from "almost exclusively Republican"[s] is false.
Claiming that votes are stolen is a weak argument that perpetuates the political duopoly.

Botnets are not limited to CPU mining - GPU mining ones exist. And the power of a botnet comes from the sheer size - a CPU may be orders of magnitude slower in terms of hash speed, but a botnet more than makes up for this with the huge amount of infected hosts.

There are rumours it was a Layer 7 attack, although the truthfulness is impossible to verify.
