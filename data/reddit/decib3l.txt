This brings a post that I made in 2012 back into attention. A Bitcoin payment is not a legally binding contract. If your carpenter decides to take payment in Bitcoin, and you pay him, you still did not legally "pay him". He can say right after "Where is my payment? You only gave me this useless BTC". The problem is that Bitcoin cannot be recognized as having a value in court, it is worthless in the eyes of a judge.
When you pay in cash yo get a recept or he would at least acknowledged that he received the payment. With Bitcoin you have . . . The Blockchain? Good luck getting a judge to look at that.

See how you need to have a judge with at least a shread of common sence? This is just not possible in the US. Take a look at [this video]( where they try to use Skype in a courtroom be he couldn't even set his status to away to prevent from getting calls. How these people are trusted to solve a murder trial is dangerous.
There was another case in a FBI Officer AMA where he witnessed a case where one of the pieces of evidence was whether or not a WiFi network could be accessed at a given location. So one of the employees goes to the location and uses his smartphone and looks for the WiFi network and didn't find it, case closed. He doesn't care what length antenna he used or at what angle he held it.
@_date: 2014-12-25 21:54:12
To add onto that. A double spend is sending a spend command and then sending another send command milliseconds after the first. So if the network only sees one send command after a few seconds, its clear that there was no double-spend.

Basically Roger Ver signed a contract with OKCoin. Then later when discussing it OKCoin's version of the contract had some extra lines in it. The contract was originally digitally signed (Cryptographically with Adobe Reader) but the version they had had the digital signature photoshopped onto it. Then the OKCoin CEO accused Roger Ver of committing the fraud and set a $20,000 bounty if anyone could prove the photoshopped document was real.
Both of them were blaming each other for not having the real contract for a while. In the end it was an OKCoin employee, Chengpeng Zhao, who photoshopped the document and passed off the lie to both his company and to Roger Ver. He then resigned.

Your interaction with Roman might have been good, he was not holding on to your money for months with you having no stake in getting it back. Have you read through the thread? 
Just going back in history it reminded me of all the infuriating things he has done. "We are waiting to hear from the bank", as if his bank is just ignoring his $1M check for a few days like it's nothing. It was later discovered that he was under a NDA and that is why he was not saying anything. It seemed like he just went on with his life like nothing happened, with the $1M check sitting on his desk and not a worry in the world. Hopefully in the future these ignorant people will land in jail.
Now, back to ICU. Many BitFloor users just stuck with ICU because of how good the user interface was, so the whole situation was a big advertisement to get users to try out your service. Maybe in the future you can offer other incentives to get Bitcoins users to open an ICU account. Perhaps instant USD deposit/withdrawal with an exchange? Just link a MtGox account with your ICU account and you never have to worry about Dwolla/ACH fees/showing sites a picture of your ID when you want to get "verified".

This is because the Bitcoin economy is not "full-loop". The problem is that if you buy a mug for BTC, the site that is selling it to you still buys that mug for $2+profit from their supplier. What Bitcoins needs is a full-loop where the facotry that makes the mug pays all of its expenses in BTC and all of their customers pay in BTC. 
When this full-loop in accomplished, then the price of the mug is completely independent of the BTC/USD price. Since the factory can continue producing the mug at the same price and earn the same profits no matter what the exchange rate is.
This is why I am starting a Bitcoin-only B2B site (think of alibaba.com) where one day Chinese factory can produce directly for BTC contracts.

I would assume this whole agreement is a "gentleman's agreement" and the amount sent just has to be something around that price. The buyer will obviously contact him to make sure that payment method is serious.
Also the buyer is at a loss here. The buyer could pay for it and the seller could just say he never got paid. If it ever goes to a real court they will send the buyer to a mental institution for saying he paid $500 in Bitcoins. (What are they going to do, look at the blockchain?)

Actually transactions are logged better with Bitcoin, because everything is in blockchain.info

Under gun/knife point someone would just ask you for *both* of your passwords.
@_date: 2013-06-17 12:00:52
If this becomes a mainstream feature could there be a feature that even when only using 1 password, random garbage is created to make all wallets look that same?

Has anyone gotten their account verified on 4/22 or 4/23? I understand their funds are frozen but they should still be verifying now rather than later.
@_date: 2013-03-12 22:58:27
No because the FBI does not see Bitcoin as a real currency.

I don't see any problem with asicminer stocks. Their dividends are completely reasonable, so why would they be running a ponzi?
@_date: 2013-05-18 19:48:38
No it cannot be a downside because you can still allow changebacks with Bitcoin by using a bitcoin bank that handles all transactions themselves. You cannot use a Paypal-proxy that does not allow chargebacks.

Then there is really no reason in blocking BTCChina specifically rather than other exchanges, they are all the same thing in essence. This just shows you the government doesn't take the Great Firewall seriously and the people of China don't either.

Everyone in China uses a VPN/proxy/SSH Tunnel. Browsing would be impossible otherwise.
@_date: 2013-10-24 20:22:18
That site is quite accurate, if that is what your asking. If it's blocked or not doesn't really matter though since many sites are blocked in China for no reason, nobody really cares anymore.
What is interesting is that [thepiratebay.se]( is not blocked in China, while the US government shut down torrent-search and MegaUpload, which means that the US authorities are more oppressive to free speech than the Great Firewall of China.

To put this into perspective, 110 W is 0.11 kW. Solar panels run for 10 years before they break. 0.11 kW over 10 years is 9636 kWh.
9636 kWh at $0.11/kWh costs $1060.
5 years ago is used to be that they perfectly pay themselves off after 20 years.
The break-even for a $198 110W panel:
$198 = 1800 kWh
kWh = 1000 * W * h
1800 = 0.11 * h
Break-even = 16363 hours **or** 1.868 years
Obviously these calculations are going to be way off because there is much more inefficiency before the electricity gets to your devices. Also the panels are 110W12V so you get a little more efficiency if you use 12V devices directly.
* For the price of a 110W panel I found [this on eBay](
I don't know how accurate it is, it could be 110W at 100% sunlight and in nature you only get 25% sunlight. I would like to hear from someone who has an eBay solar panel.
EDIT: I should really sell solar panels for Bitcoins!

It must be very suspicious when he is audited for tax fraud and all they see is a whole bunch of withdrawals and deposits from his bank.
@_date: 2013-03-29 19:30:17
That would be straight up theft
@_date: 2013-06-18 16:12:51
I never thought about the repercussions. You don't loose any features over the full client. The worst that could happen I would imagine would be that you make a transaction and it doesn't relay in the network.
No "fake" transaction would be possible because they would need your private key to "sign" a transaction.
@_date: 2013-06-16 07:40:52
Yes but that build script is open-source so it would be almost impossible to implement a backdoor.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:44:51
Does this make the transaction fee $0.10 right now?

Basically right now Americans have the advantages of being able to deposit by cash at any 7-11/Walmart/BoA because of how ghetto these places are and don't care about money laundry, but American banks have ancient infrastructure. All of Europe has instant deposits because the EU let SEPA put all the banks into one system. Russians have lots of online banks (like Paypal), look at the 20 different sites that btc-e.com accepts

And then he said it in a way that he has something against Germans. "Other countries don't do this". Yea, probably because Germans don't expect that bad service, if BFL is in Germany they would be in jail.
Good thing you had the balls to go to the State Attorney.

I just noticed how important this is, if the NSA had full control of all the SSL providers (RapidSSL, VeriSign), think of what they could do! Could they do a middleman attack on an SSL connection and it would work because the SSL provider is in on it?

They just have to create a new version of the client with a new public key. They can do that because they have an account on github/sourceforge to release the new client.
