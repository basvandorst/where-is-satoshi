I entirely agree. For me, using BTC to make purchases feels nice and cozy - inspiring even if you want to take it that far. The first thing I ever bought with BTC was a golden zelda 3DS, for obvious reasons. 
What was your first BTC purchase? 
P. S. I love that you turn a portion of every check into crypto. I have yet to buy any myself, I just mine.

To me that actually gives it more validity - as in the writers/Netflix EXPECT their audience to already be familiar with what the techie in the show is describing. But I get your point also.

My 73GH/s are jealous.
@_date: 2014-10-24 02:31:44
No, we're calling those dicks who act toxic to the community, regardless of how much literature they've put out there to show people how to secure themselves. If one can't point those people in that direction instead of flaming them - then that makes one a dick.
You can build a thousand bridges and suck one cock, you will still be a cocksucker.
@_date: 2014-03-09 01:28:25
Such jealousy.

Android doesn't work? I must be hallucinating then.

No it was not.

There goes that plan.

I wish I could come, but I'm stuck in Redondo Beach for the day... maybe I'll manage to show my face tomorrow.
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:43:57
Explore the source code, and the repositories on which it resides. Lots of great discussions take place there, here, and many other places also. If the whole thing begins to feel like an extension of yourself - you're doing it right. :)
@_date: 2014-10-24 00:45:56
If those people spew toxic shit rather than directing the subjects to their hard work then yeah, they're assholes.

Looks like my girlfriend and I have to take a little trip up North again.
@_date: 2014-02-15 22:41:38
I was pretty stoked when I heard it be mentioned so nonchalantly.
@_date: 2014-02-04 23:26:06
Cheers, mate! I love you, too.
"layers of Bitcoin" - my favorite.

I am reluctantly from the greater Los Angeles area, a city by the name of Redondo Beach to be exact. Half of the beach bros switched to vaporizers, and them plus the hipster elite are creating quite the stigma.
@_date: 2014-10-24 00:38:43
And I was about to make a comment stating we should be less zealous. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 01:56:18
So humble lol
@_date: 2014-10-24 00:40:44
The whole ecig community seems, to me at least, to be comprised of elitist hipsters. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:50:53
I have to live here for the time being... take me with you next time you pass through. We can pierce the clouding void of vapor together! 
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:30:15
I'm gonna keep my fanboy dick in my pants for this one. I got my girlfriend a 5S and it makes her happy, too. I have needs other than Bitcoin that iphones and ipads can't accomodate so for me that is a dealbreaker but if it makes you happy stick with it.
I just thought "I just want my shit to work" reeked of ignorance, but instead it's a result of a fucked up first impression. I hope another droid comes your way that rocked your socks like my Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 7 did for me.
@_date: 2014-01-30 21:47:34
And then one day I return home, only to find my computers and miners missing.
@_date: 2014-09-22 19:46:28
Like I would tell you. :P
@_date: 2014-09-22 19:56:11
But does he strike you as someone who loses that kind of information? 
@_date: 2014-09-22 20:44:54
I'm still a student, and only get $18/hr as a result. I suppose I could buy a coin every two weeks. You inspired me sir, at least at the current market price. Also I live in California - as long as you're over 18 getting quality THC into your system is easier than buying alcohol.
@_date: 2013-05-20 21:15:32
Can you explain to me what a PT share is? I'm assuming it's "part" of a share? And if that's true - I am slightly confused as to how dividend payouts and such would work out.
@_date: 2013-05-20 22:09:52
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-06-19 01:54:26
If the RPI uses the card as it's primary storage device then that's most definitely it, I did not know that was the case. I still want one.
@_date: 2013-06-16 09:29:58
In deed it would undermine their own wealth.
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:04:03
Because it is one more payment method, the more the merrier! And you can cash in on people like me who just buy stuff with Bitcoin solely because we can. I would have never otherwise purchased alpaca socks. 
@_date: 2013-06-16 14:29:02
Thank you kind Sir.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:18:31
Keep it, for the love of god!
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:59:38
This is why I don't buy mining equipment with BTC. I'm sorry you got roped in to BFL's overreaching promises as well. I sold my jalapenos for over $700 each on ebay, give it a go if you like.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:15:14
Most definitely, that's also kind of why I opted for mining rather than investing in coin. Yeah I didn't proliferate my investment the way I could have with buying coins directly, but since the miners paid themselves off it's been nothing but raw profit.
I even sold my Jalapeno's for three times their retail value and got better ASIC's in return, nothing but good news over here!
@_date: 2013-06-09 09:31:36
Not long ago a single coin wasn't worth a penny, some believe Bitcoin to rise in to the thousands so there's the motivation.
@_date: 2013-06-22 04:49:50
Lol that was funny though

What a great video, I was just about to post it myself but it looks like I missed the party! :D

Yo so I figured it out, I tried tipping you the exact amount I got from and did not calculate the fee in there!

@_date: 2013-11-30 00:13:40
Danke vielmals, sir! That was my first ever Bitcoin tip! :D
I want to begin tipping people, is it as simple as creating an account with the tip bot and loading up an address with coin?
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:27:08
You're a saint, man. :)
@_date: 2013-05-15 11:15:03
Buy a coin, the rest is history.
@_date: 2013-06-16 15:14:45
The joke was that if all BTC GPU miners switched the hashrate would triple from what it is now over night. 
@_date: 2013-06-22 12:06:11
I will most likely buy three: one as an offline wallet, one for my room, and one for the living room so my roommates can feast on my digital content library. :D
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:16:11
Just buy however much coin you can or want, you don't have to own a full Bitcoin - that's part of the appeal.
@_date: 2013-05-20 23:03:41
I've been glancing over the information and that's basically what I've gathered as well - you just pay a 5% fee to the actual shareholder.
@_date: 2013-05-20 16:20:37
What a sweet sweet thing this is 
@_date: 2013-06-16 09:28:25
All the casual LTC miners will be sad when the day comes that all GPU miners switch. That'll probably triple the litecoin hashrate. :P

If nothing else those are awesome photos! :)

I would never eat those unless she made more, which I would really hope she did. Those aren't only awesome they also look delicious.

Haha that got deleted quick, thanks for the pro-activity.

Since this is moronic Monday here goes mine: Is there a contact person to buy ASICMiner shares or do I need to post a request on the forum/here and hope for someone to be willing to sell a share?
@_date: 2013-06-16 09:25:40

Yeah please keep making these, they really help my constipation. 
No but seriously they're awesome.
