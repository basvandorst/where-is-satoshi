Good question, however perhaps someone should ask him how he is going to implement this first? Perhaps he just writes once every 10 mins to the chain so could be a no issue... Finding out his implementation design is key here.

Perhaps this is where his bitcache comes in, keeping the bulk of the tagging on the users local client/wallet. Time will tell.

It's the first time in history that two people who don't know each other can actually trust each other, without a third party(normally a bank or notary).
The "trust" part is the ultimate truth and value of bitcoins blockchain technology as it spreads that decision amongst many participants.
Because of this, it's application to real world issues spreads into all facets of human endeavour. Wherever trust is required, bitcoins blockchain will ultimately crawl into that space via additional layers built on top of the chain. We can only dream of what is to come.

Unfortunately this will be the only reason they let it pass, so price controlling can be had over this asset class due to direct competition to the USD which becomes a national security issue.

One thing bitcoin has taught me is you can check-in anytime you like, but you can never leave...The reason the Eagles were right about bitcoin is due to the fact it keeps deflating, increasing your purchasing power over time. 
This makes you frugal in your spending habits, and life in general, becoming a pro in hodling to save/acquire each and every one of those super rare and often stealthy satoshis. 
The ironic thing is many crypto wealthy users are continuing on with normal day-to-day work, so not a satoshi is wasted... spending only the worthless fiat. This type of low time preference mindset will bring humanity back to the fruits of her hard earned labour. This is unlike today's high time preference fiat millionaires,  who retire adding little and often becoming a burden to the general populace.
Such is the difference between bitcoin and fiat (low/high time prefs) that all facets of life will be revalued in the coming age.

Yes, every fiat currency in the world is loosing value. All central banks around the world are colluding in printing money like the world has never seen. The world has not learnt from Japan who have been printing non stop for over 20 years now. This will end very bad as they are not allowing bubbles to come back down to realistic values. The biggest wealth transfer is happening right now make sure you take advantage when this system systematically fails by betting against the debt bubble.

Not really, what it actually does change though is your psychology of how you spend. Instead of spending on wants, you make the conscious effort to spend only what you need. This thinking on a larger scale produces products for the consumer that is more efficient and worthwhile for the whole.

If transaction levels go down on the btc chain, due to sidechains or lightening network etc, wouldn't the price of each btc go up to balance the demand? I guess if too many miners start merge mining a well incentive sidechain the incentive to keep the btc chain strong would eventually win out otherwise all would not exist...its a great point you have thought of...I'm wondering exactly how this merge mining works, I mean could you have proof of stake for example as a side chain? I guess it's limitless what you could or couldn't have!

Bitcoin is starting off and acting in a hybrid fashion with fiat, however as you pointed out it will be the natural choice after fiat fails, as historically it always has.
@_date: 2014-07-21 23:22:50
I didn't say inflation started in 2008, but the collapse of the financial system.
I think you need to look back in history a bit further before fiat currencys were around and you will see gold/silver were indeed what was traded.
The 50% attack is not the issue, what is the issue is the 1mb block limit.
I hope you have an intelligent day! :)

The cheaper it gets the more you purchase...that your comfortable with. The bigger picture must be has the technology proven faulty that renders it not working or usless?

Depends who you ask...I would be putting the dollars into gold or silver right now (pref Silver) and I could give you a list of reasons why, however there will be someone else who could give you a list of reasons why that is crazy idea. So just gotta do your own research and go with what is right for you, but you have my answer at this point in time.
@_date: 2014-04-29 06:29:46
- Send your money, anywhere, anytime and to anyone...instantly and securely
- You become your own bank, responsible for your own net worth
- Enjoy extremely low fees when sending money internationally to family and friends
- Bitcoin is a push system, no change is ever required
- Identity theft and counterfeiting are the thing of the past
- Own something that is geniunely unique like gold, but divisible like money
- Inflation slowly destroys your dollars, bitcoin protects them

Most investors look at short term gains. If they turn there attention to a more long-term approach, they will see that bitcoin has done well and over a 5 year period, will continue to do so. So they get zesty that they missed the boat and its a pozi or this or that. My only recommendation is to purchase and put away and check back in 5 years,  a good patient investor test.
@_date: 2014-12-16 05:49:26

Bitcoins price can very easily be manipulated as the price is set on an exchange where traders are involved.  Sometimes the bigger trading players have a target of making as much cash as possible and depending on that players poistion, this means driving and holding that price down by any means possible for as long as possible, why would you stop? Eventually these bigger players loose there grip and the market moves. 
The best thing to look at is the fundamentals to confirm what you are investing in still has a solid ground and invest accordingly. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 07:50:45

Everything he mentioned, btc does better except in terms of volatility (however this will improve as the market cap grows), I reckon he's priming the market for their own coin...which will be an alt with the disadvantages of centralisation which will ultimately lead to the fiat type system we have today...and we know where that's going.

Miners dumping coins happens, but only the small mining guys. The big mining players all have contracts and there coins are purchased off exchange. All it takes is either another Cyprus moment or perhaps something like a new ETF? to help kick start a fresh price swing. Long term I'm bull and the current long long price drop from Jan is shaking out weak hands and moving them into very strong and grippy institutional hands that know the true value of the coin.
@_date: 2014-12-05 07:19:15

Whatever wallet software you use, make sure encryption is enabled and just remember the private key and I mean make a story in your mind that you go over when you wake up first thing and before you goto bed to allow you to recover it.
Do not leave anything with anyone as once the value of these things goes up, so will that be a testing of their values... so no point putting anyone through that.
Wheather you go away for a while or not,  do this anyway, perhaps only 50% if your a free man, as its a great retirement account.

It's OK, the federal reserve has already destroyed it (happened in 2008 actually) and what we are seeing today is the last desperate attempts to keep propping up the system and keeping the illusion alive that all is well and stable. 
When the masses begin to wake and realise that simply having cash in the bank is actually loosing value, due to inflation and eventually hyper-inflation, then there will be a run to physical (not paper) precious metals. 
What people don't realise is ordering large quantities of physical metal i.e &gt;10tons is becoming difficult as there actually isn't that much of it around, investors/industries will make sure that they buy in bulk to protect their individual/company's wealth preservation. This leaves the general population or main street with not much left in my view, except bitcoin as being an alternative and a possible run into this.
Technically it makes sense to put our money into bitcoin as it is mathmatically calculated, maths cannot become corrupted unlike our current monetary policies, which is generally normal when humans are involved. People will loose faith in fiat currency and will demand something that cannot be tinkled with by policy makers, bitcoin will make even more sense to the masses than it does now.

Ultimately data mining centers will be the norm,  probably banks or google/amazon etc partnered with Amd or Intel will be the ones who will want to secure the payment network. Different mining centers might be around depending on the speed transactions need to be confirmed. At that stage the amount of investment in R&amp;D would force them to be trustworthy or hopefully decentralized p2pools are still around so the trust is at least distributed

This will happen, make no mistake about it. The government's took the load of the debt and bailed out these shakey financial institutions 5 years ago, unfortunately no regulation was put on the bankers and once again we are at the end of that long road the can has been kicked down. 
This time round however the government's are all insolvent, which is why they will be coming into your savings account or bail in the financial sector. 
Your only option for wealth preservation and you must do this before it happens I.e now...is to acquire,  as best as you financially can,  those assets that cannot be duplicated like precious metals and bitcoin.
This finance system has been on life support since 2008 all the issues that got us here still exist and are infact many times worse I.e debt/derivatives /stock/bond/housing markets and the cracks are growing wider everyday. So look after yourselves as best as you can and prepare now, because when everyone is running for those non duplicating assets its gonna get crazy.

There is no system more efficient at transferring money than bitcoin. The banks, at some point will need to incorporate this into their existing payment models, just like we are seeing with paypal. The only difference will be the end user probably won't know they are actually using the bitcoin network as the gui will be bank branded. However the market cap will need to become much larger to facilitate what an average bank would transfer between themselves and their customers.

The fixed amount has great divisibility, this will help immensely in distribution.

I'm thinking down the road here...
Lets say in 5 -10 years bitcoin is adopted on a mass scale and everyone uses it, this is because most Fiat currency's that stand today have fallen over due to current debt levels bursting and governments defaulting, so bitcoin is the saving grace...
Under this circumstance, how would an insurance company insure your bitcoins, when there is only a finite supply? 
I.e what if Satoshi (someone with lots of coins) wanted to insure, how would they do this?

@_date: 2014-03-01 12:29:44
I'm there till the ship sinks all the way to the bottom - here's why: 
Basically if you look at what is happening from a Global point of view, both Financially and Economically people are going to be forced into either precious metals or Virtual Currency's. 
The USD will ultimately head into inflationary territory which will be fun, thanking the Feds for that. China is on that same verge, Japan too, check out inflation numbers in Venezuela or Argentina, look at what is happening in Syria or now the Ukraine. 
There are so many triggers and only a couple of cracked pillers left holding the old systems up, I really do think people will be forced to take up this technology sooner rather than later (although I wish this wasn't the case - i.e everything was right and just) :)

I believe they really only have one option to help thwart the rise and rise of the honey badger and this is an attack on the volatility of the system. Because they have basically unlimited fiat due to the addiction of unlimited, zero interest money, they could quietly accumulate as much btc as possible (yes price will rise over time) and then begin some serious rounds of dumping and pumping(making our 30k btc manbearwhale wall seem like a dolphin) and at the same time make some nice profit at what they do best, manipulating and distorting market perceptions.

Do you really believe they have tapered? When interest rates rise, then you will know they have actually tapered. Will they let rates rise? Probably not as they can't afford the repayments on the debt....so you have this illusion that all is well and the economy is prospering...but if the food stamp program wasn't around, those waiting in line for bread would be many times longer than that of the great depression.

1 btc is worth exactly 1 btc, just like 1 ounce of gold is worth 1 once of gold. What you will notice is that it is the value of fiat currency that is actually moving in comparison to the respective store of value which doesn't change.

Well it was a time in 2008 where a lot of people lost a lot of money in many areas and they called it the GFC. That was our moment where the system collapsed.
What we see today is the problems from that time were never resolved, just masked over with masses of QE printing rounds.
Make no mistake that these notes (over half of them outside the US right now) WILL come home to roost, flooding the economy. Yes, they can raise the bond yields, but unfortunately that moment of control has passed)
In reality nothing has intrinsic value as it is all based off perception, however looking at gold/silvers 2000+ year use, you realise that peoples perceptions of it was that of value and use.

Yeap good news all round. What I think you'll find is that as the price of btc heads north or when the vaule of usd heads south (whenever this maybe?) these companys converting all instantly to usd will begin to hold a small percentage in btc and that percentage of holding will grow in proportion to the btc price. The next feedback loop of holding will be heavy due to the amount of merchants now able to select this option due to merchants like bitpay.

@_date: 2014-10-03 05:04:41
The more applications that are built on top of the bitcoin blockchain, the more underlying value each bitcoin token potentially has, this is because the underlying security of the blockchain becomes more desirable and the only way to secure the network is for miners to be rewarded with these tokens.

Your exactly right. 
Bitcoins intrinsic value is the Blockchain. 
You will see alot of thoughts how bitcoin the protocol is outstanding and they all really really want this and see this as the future. However there thoughts usually include a centralized ideal surrounding the protocol due to looking after number one, which most people are use to doing and I don't blame them. However if you want the blockchain tech, you need the token that secures it.

Keep your cash in fiat and it WILL loose its purchasing power, statistics of the US dollar since going off the gold standard has shown this, even more so with QE which is on-going via the backdoor of banks being required to hold liquid assets, i.e stealth QE.

Bitcoin is mathmatically calculated and so the monetry supply is released within these set parameters.

There current kit of servers is irrelevant when it comes to mining, there gonna need fresh capital and new kit if they want to compete in the mining space. Tbh it's something which they'll prob not get into heavily, they'll rather focus on the transaction side and lower there costs via a network that is secure and highly efficient.

Hash power of the bitcoin network would drop initially until the next difficulty adjustment which could be approx two weeks and then transactions would begin to flow more readily again.
The rest of the world will continue its purchases on the bitcoin blockchain as normal, Chinas nodes will be unable to replicate to nodes outside of China where bulk of transactions are happening. If Chinese miners/nodes are unable to reconnect they might try and start up there own coin. BitcoinChina or something like that.
The hashing gap left over on the bitcoin network will eventually (might take a couple of years) be filled with entrapunears/hedgefunds who will see a fantastic opportunity to get in on the mining scene with better ROI than today.
Bitcoin will carry on regardless of any state or nation that doesn't want to participate.

They already have acquired the required amount of coin, so I'm assuming only once all their shares have been purchased will we begin to see on exchange purchases begin to happen which may raise the price. Even then the purchases may just be OTC which will result in no effect on the market price, just depends on where they purchase them, if they need to at all really.

I understand where your coming from, however btc does need to integrate first into the existing system, I see this as a hybrid bitcoin/fiat setup. I think Satoshi will be smiling though as in the long run we know fiat will fall by the wayside leaving only btc left and ready to pickup the slack.

Due to central banks and there complete manipulation of most markets in the world due to their fear of deflation,  I'm thinking perhaps what we actually need is some proper deflation,  this is what the free market would do if it wasn't so god dam throttled by constant QE and negative interest rates by all central banks colluding around the world. 
What they are doing now is there only tool they have left and it's decimating the middle class heading us back to a two tier system of rich and poor. 2008 was the game over moment for this system yet they keep propping it up and the more they prop the bigger the drop will be. Obama has added more debt in his past 6 years of presidency than all the presidents combined and then some.
Net negative for humanity, short term it carries on as normal, mid term everyone feels the pinch, long term complete chaos and prob war as that has always worked for countries. 
The blockchain technology is what will help revolutionize this old and cancerous financial system as once peoples personalitys and egos are removed from important decisions, you get results that are for the better of humanity,  rather than the influential few. Of course to use the most secure chain, from my point of view would be bitcoin and I believe it will be the only system left standing after the currecys have long ago died off into the stratosphere of inflation as that has what always has happened to every currency when more was ever printed. Ah yeah and you'll notice they can't turn the taps off as once you start printing, you can never stop, the markets force to keep printing, watch America start their QE4 round sometime this year.

Ultimately it would be the fees that the miners receive for transactions. These fees will be in proportion to the amount of traffic they are mining with priority traffic costing more...you may have miners that only deal with high priority traffic and some that deal with slow non-priority and some in the middle for average but not to expensive transactions. These miners would need to agree amongst themselves to raise the 21 million cap so &gt; 80% consensus. It's possible they may do this, however it prob wouldn't be viable to get the full consensus to do this, however you never know? Ultimately raising the cap lowers the value of those who hold the coins, which by then would be some very powerful people who prob own the miners and wouldn't allow this to happen. Political and Economic reasoning suggests they wouldn't do this, but you can never know.

Time to look at the bigger picture. Paypal are money transmitters at the front of their game in terms of payment processing technology. They  obviously cannot create a more efficient money transfer system, even with their technological might, so have chosen to piggy back on the most efficient payment processing technology we have ever seen. 
I can see a time where other payment processing firms come to the same conclusion,  I.e Mastercard/Visa/Western Union etc. Ultimately the banking system may come to the same conclusion for interbank transfers and at this point the liquidity pool must be higher for these guys to transact I.e A higher price per coin than today
This is just the payment side, wait to smart contracts etc start to be understood and utilized on a larger scale.

Bigger blocks will lower fees and keep fees low as the blocks adjust to ever larger sizes.
I call bullshit and an obvious power grab by Jihan to gain more control, especially of how fees are calculated. 
The irony is that even with BU the blocks will still be small due to the control the miners are given, as the wealth from the current high transaction fees are too good to give up.
@_date: 2017-03-22 05:48:59
Let's assume BU fork it and off they go with there altcoin (they use different consensus on the nodes so it's an alt). Miners will soon realise the value of that chain is less (because who accepts a coin called BTU?) and they won't want to mine coins that are less than bitcoins cause they don't make as much moolah. Jihan will then point his miners back at bitcoins chain and will either begin signalling segwit or not. If not a POW change is brewing or perhaps another alternative that involves POW + users. It's gonna be show time and I can't wait for segwit.

I'd happily secure the BTC chain - so too will scores of others.
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:11:34
It must be noted that the fee market will be competitive as every tom dick and harry will be firing up nodes to earn some sweet interest rates for having their coins held within the lightening network - like a savings account.
However in doing so the nodes become even more decentralized so the incentives for securing the node network is really a masterstroke and great byproduct of lightening.
Also as there are less coins available on bitcoins base layer, the availability of coins will dry up, causing price to head north due to supply and demand ratios.
Miners will actually make more money than ever before as lightening transactions that are required/needed need a mining fee to open and close those channels + a miner of course can run a full segwit ready node to take advantage of the interest rate for storing there savings on the lightening network.
Let's not forget Sidechains will be available once segwit is activated allowing coins to be locked up to create any type of alt you can dream up - Once again coins locked up will dry out the supply creating upwards pressure on the price.
@_date: 2017-03-31 06:30:07
Basically being a bitcoin miner is a shitter of a job as your constantly scrapping the barrell trying to get ahead of your competitors. Each difficulty adjustment is the start of your demise.

If it has anything to do with the purchasing power of fiat currency's being reduced, in particular USD or CNY then I'd be expecting a possible moonshot due to the fear trade being played.
Right now we have 30 Trillion in offshore accounts as detailed in the Panama papers, if this starts hunting for safety, this alone would inflate the price over 500k per BTC and that's is being very conservative. 
Don't get me started if actual assets started to be priced in BTC I.e real estate.

Bitcoin will only stabilize once all money and world physical/digital assets are priced in bitcoins native currency I.e millibits, bits etc. 
Until then and while being continuously priced against fiat currency's I.e USD/CNY expect the price to fluctuate wildly and more than likely to the upside as currency's around the world are devalued due to the crushing debt load the world has decided it will borrow based on resources still being available in the future. 
The wake up moment will be when we realize that the resources we have borrowed against are no longer available, this is when faith and confidence will be lost and those holding GLD/SLV/BTC will probably be the only happy people left on this planet of utter chaos as the economic systems begin to totally and utterly fall apart.
@_date: 2017-01-26 08:18:08
There is an increase of blocksize already on the table and they haven't taken it, otherwise we wouldn't be having this discussion. 
LN will in fact increase there fees via two ways: A) When the channel is closed - think about millions/billions of those eventual channels closing and the fees the miners would get as people would actually be willing to use bitcoin for micro-transactions instead of not being able to use them now B) The additional utility each bitcoin gains due to layer 2 additions I.e MimbleWimble/Sidechains/Drivechains etc each addition adds value to each bitcoin, this means the price goes up and miners once again earn more.
The miners are far to short sighted in there views so what is there motivation against the citizens of bitcoin.

Think about the legitimacy China is doing right now with removing fake trading volumes, think about why they are trying to remove as much volatility as possible? They need these coins to be as cheap as possible for themselves and the people's. Look at the current hash rate and the amount of miners coming onboard, why would they spend such crazy sums of money when at current prices it would take forever to make any profit? This is because a large price increase is lingering on the horizon, it won't be straight up but it will be like that of a shark/alligators tooth and removing margin stops these teeth becoming effiel towers.

Automatic payments will have to be done by an app or third party where you will have to give your private keys to I.e Coinbase for instance could easily add this to their wallets.  
NFC/ Card swipe is great but only if your physically near the counter, bitcoin far surpasses in terms of reach as you can already guess. In terms of competition to close counter proximity payments all it takes is a third party wallet provider such as Mycelium or Jaxx etc etc to add the NFC functionality required to get this movement happening.
Basically bitcoin is an entrepreneurs wet dream, what you are worried about/ think is lacking in the ecosystem is an opportunity to create and full in the gaps as you see fit.

Before jumping to conclusions on price per BTC one must understand how the ETF is setup and administered. What if the COIN ETF was to create a share, valued at 1/10th of a BTC and the BTC being used was the  stash of over x% of the total BTC monetary supply that the winklevoss lads own. If this is the case the coins have already been purchased and that 300million of fresh money would not be happening on an exchange I.e offchain so why would that push the price for this particular ETF? Now where it gets interesting is when the stash of allocated coins are exhausted I.e they need more shares...This is where they may come onto an exchange I.e Gemini and purchase what is required to meet there customers needs, this is where you will prob see a price boost, unless of course they purchase OTC (over the counter) then you'll once again see no price increase. 
In conclusion I wouldn't count on a immediate 10k btc as it really is dependent on how the ETF is setup, although general speculators on exchanges will nudge the price up due to the news.

First, they have only temporarily done this.
Second, watch the growth of the exchanges providing margin outside of China.
Last but not least,  what is applied in one nation does not apply when a currency is borderless and only weakens that nations position as others jump the steps on the cryptocurrency ladder.
@_date: 2017-01-28 23:34:54
I'm sure this could be done if consensus was approved. But if (big if) segwit gets approved then you'll be able to send many transactions in a short amount of time I.e lightening so if your looking to get blocks propergating the network faster to get transactions approved they'll be little point at that stage.

Think of the internet... When you goto different websites (for good or for bad) the internet does not care and simply sends the information (packets via TCP/IP) and you get that website you were after. 
Bitcoin is exactly the same, it does not care what you are purchasing or exchanging (for good or bad) it simply does it regardless. I hope this helps.

It's a win/win for miners in my opinion over the long term financially to activate segwit. The reason they haven't is beyond me, which can only lead me to the conclusion that something more sinister is going on behind the scenes I.e powergrab or an ultimate contentious fork.

Bitcoin is programmable money, if the need arises the decimal place can be moved over to create a milli/micro/nano Satoshi etc to accompany whatever demand is required. 
A country that runs purely on Bitcoin will naturally become efficient in every endeavour it does. Resources will become fairly priced as items of needs, not wants becomes the norm. 
Example: Why should I purchase that car today? When if I wait 6 months I can obtain it for less because my satoshis are worth more. Now the car manufacturers have to provide some real value to that car today so I spend today. There incentives of providing a better car for me  are stronger than in an Inflating environment where I am forced to spend as my money is becoming less. Now enlarge this to all facets of life and you'll see an economy of high efficiency where things that offer little value are quickly discarded because they make no money.

Long term you would support it. It allows a shit load more transactions to happen it keeps the core layer 1 of the network decentralized, allowing more centralisation to happen instead on layer 2 (which is far less significant compared to layer 1)...Sidechains/Drivechains/Tumblebit/Rootstock the world is your oyster in terms of bolt-ons you can add to the underlying network, therefore increasing the value of each bitcoin as each utility is added.

They think there way is right no matter what, even defending the way there Dev team almost toasted the network today, this shows you the complete passion Roger has created in his quest for a freemarket. Anyhow BU appears to be gaining traction and soon to be overtaking segwit so the miners are obviously clueless to the Dev team they are siding with. If this doesn't change soon unfortunately I'll be preparing for a messy hardfork although I hope logic prevails and the miners wake the fk up :/

After the fork you will have coins on each chain - Abiet the value of each would have plummeted. The wallet you use will decide if it's the BU chain or the Core chain and your mates wallet will have to be on the same chain you decide to use.

You need to create a live wallpaper that updates the price, has a chart (multiple), has alerts, can have multiple exchanges in the one wallpaper so you don't need to goto any app for the quick visual. All this needs to be fully customisable I.e currency/candle types/background colour etc...Hook this into a wallet like Jaxx for auto buy/sells using the inbuilt shapeshift integration and yeah I'd pay  upto $10 for that.

Nodes are required to relay the transactions across the network. I'm unaware of a so called minimum, however there would surely need to be x amount of nodes otherwise transactions for that nodes version wouldn't be populated. I guess economic, financial and political preference sways what node version is ultimately run and eventually this builds the  minimum node count that you see.

Think about this from the miners point of view. Why upgrade to segwit when if you leave it like it is your earning more because of higher transaction fees?

No bitcoin trading site is 100% secure so be mindful that trading is risky as the bitcoins will be stored and looked after by the site while your trades are being executed. Site examples are: Kraken/Bitstamp/OkCoin/BTC-e headover to if your after more trading related Bitcoin talk.

There are many geo political hotspots in the world right now, Italy is definitely one of them which could (no one know for sure) cause the Euro price of Bitcoin to shoot far ahead of what it is now. 
The ETFs (well the winklevoss twins) are going to be offering a 10th of a Bitcoin as one share in there fund. They currently own (within the single digits as a percentage) of all bitcoins ever created and will be basing there shares off this pool of coins. Once the pool of units against these coins has been exhausted they will be coming onto the open market i.e there Gemini Exchange to purchase whatever amount is required to satisfy user demand.
As a side note in January kimdotcom in conjunction with bitcoin/maidsafe/storj will be sending an email out to over 100 million email accounts for the announcement of Megaupload 2.0 which uses there own bitcache in conjunction with bitcoin.

Like most of the population (and this is nothing against your folks or mine for that matter). It won't matter how much you explain, even when you know how right you are they prob just won't/can't be arsed in taking it seriously. The only time you will be vindicated is when bail-ins/cash bans are proceeding or btc is hitting some crazy new all-time high. But by then you'll probably be more of a target (not from family or friends) but rather the governments due to new tax laws as there won't be many items that are considered honest money. Hey I never said this path would be easy.

This is well said, change who has power of the monetary supply and you literary change who has the control of the people. Bitcoin is that fundamental change, that revolution that our most innate sense knows can give control back to its citizens. I have never been so excited about a technology that finally has the potential to stop creating wars through unlimited debt creation and to put a slow end to the stealthist of all tax's, inflation, where by the people's are inslaved to make sure the expanded monetary supply's interest is paid.

They have already not paid there creditors. Normally you would default when a nation is decided on what they want.

The fact is the IMF will not allow Greece to default. Notice that Greece missed there first payment and no default was mentioned...they will also miss there up coming second payment and still Greece will not be defaulting, they are simply being forced into delaying the payments to the IMF.
Defaulting will instantly begin the cascade of Credit Default Swaps and the whole system will begin to impload.
This is financial terrorism at it's finest people, they can't pay and are not allowed to default, it's a total joke. This whole crony tyranny financial system will end in a biblical way and you best be in assets that have no counterparty risk, as the greatest transfer of wealth is but a blink away from humanity.

@_date: 2016-02-21 00:02:17
Yeap well said bro. I'm pretty excited by some form of consensus, even though it's not signed by all, at least it's  some form of agreement by Core. To back it up with formal doco would really be fantastic and allow us to hopefully start working and moving in the same direction again.

This is what I love about bitcoin, it's an opt-in system where you are not forced to use it by a government. Each individual who works in the bitcoin sphere either together or in competition furthers the whole ecosystem, which is why its growth will be impressive over the next 5 to 10 years. Meanwhile in the failing fiat system, competition kills off centralized party's, easily creating monopolys allowing corruption to foster, eating itself from the inside out.

Bitcoins monetary policy incentives users to save. It Incentivises you so well that over a 4 year period (one of those years will be negative return) you will smash any investment you previously had. All it requires is Hodling on your behalf, never has an asset class been so within reach of all.

@_date: 2017-10-11 05:40:07
Getting in before the fork and riding the run up will be high on everyone's minds due to the current 20% dividend you would receive after the B2x fork. Waiting may get you in at a cheaper price point but you will miss the approx 20% dividend and what happens if everyone sells the dividend to purchase more BTC? Perhaps the correction your waiting for might not be as large as you had hoped hmm?

I'm personally on the side of Core and value decentralisation for the good and longevity of the network and pray segwit is allowed. However because of the large block talk not allowed here, it's possible that the rug could be swept clean from underneath us, simply because most have no idea the persuasion that is happening to the miners in other endeavours.
@_date: 2015-11-28 00:54:34
Yeap this is a very good point.
Depending on how an ETF is setup, they will basically be able to lend out however many paper contracts (IOU's of btc) as required to swing and manipulate the price that is beneficial to there positions at the time.
What is happening in the gold market right now is downright ludicrous, approx 300 paper contracts for every ounce of gold. That's 299 people who "think" and "believe" they have an ounce. Just wait when they realise they don't.
I'm positive the manipulation is about to break very very soon and in doing so put light on the darkness within.

Once your in crypto, stopping bitcoin transactions is impossible. As when one government blocks, another will see an opportunity to invest, due to the nature of competition and wanting to get an upper hand in terms of economic growth...which is becoming harder and harder to come by with the traditional centralized payment methods.

Yeah it is pretty scary what is happening and what thee ultimate end game is? I can only assume to hyper-inflate the debt, as that is where endless money printing historically has always taken us, so that the debt becomes essentially worthless. 
Another issue is when you print money, you start to borrow resources from the future, under the assumption that they will be there later on down the track. Things can get ugly  when the realisation of those resources are no longer available, this normally leads to financial/economic wars which can lead into total war.

We have been waiting patiently for over a year with continued delays and stall tactics. Segwit has been in testing and has now been activated on other competing blockchains. Bitcoins dominance has been falling like a rock as other blockchains provide what bitcoin cannot i.e low fees, smartcontracts, instant transactions, all doable with segwit being the first step. The users now must force segwit in, otherwise it's aslippery as scaling bottles us up and other chains takeover.

Peoples can create their own blockchains, however getting proper security on that chain is where possible issues arise and also connecting that chain to other secured / permissioned chains(ledgers) is where you need that connecting bridge to all which is what bitcoins blockchain will become.

I really don't think people understand just how close we are now to a real financial collapse i.e 2008 was just a cup, now floating in a vast ocean of derivatives. 
The central banks of the world are printing like no other time in the history of fiscal policy, let me be clear that this is the equivalent of throwing a drowning man buckets of water. 
If you have any exposure to IRA/401k/Super plans etc you need to get your money the  out of there.

All the money printing that is happening in the world by all the central banks and all at the same time is leading up to one hell of a devastating event for fiat currencys.

As the btc reward for mining is halved so to is the incentive to receive more transactions per block to help make up for the halving. Each halving going forward will place more pressure to accept more transactions per block, until all revenue is ultimately derived from transaction fees.

A chain split, especially 3 way won't last too long as freshly minted coins are locked for 100 blocks. Miners must make sure they choose the chain the users are on or the coins are worthless

I think once the main players come on board (usually last in the cycle) we can then have something decent I.e send btc to google email address, which automagically adds it to your google wallet and you can forward that on... or like wise once telcos get onboard with your mobile phone number etc 
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:14:59

Do some research into how much VC money is going into btc startups, look where the smartest brains are moving to, you'll see there leaving positions like fb/google etc to the btc industry.

I for one think deflation might be a good thing. In a deflationary environment the difference between wants and needs become apparent, therefore essentials become the backbone of production, rather than the dreamy desires of wants. 
The reason why central banks are so hell bent on not having deflation is because the debts that they owe do not go away, at least with inflation, which ultimately leads to hyperinflation, there is eventually the good chance your debt becomes worthless and your off the hook.

This is a great idea, taking it a step further each btc account for each piece of art is also verifable proof of existence.  I would not have it on the back of the artwork however on the front so if duplicates are made your reward can carry on (providing the qr isn't changed). Which leaves me to the possibility if using a faint or transparent qr on the artwork, so if copied its still there in the background, however qr readers can still pick it up (this is me hypothetically thinking). 
@_date: 2015-03-18 06:15:20
There is no way out of this...raise rates and market forces begin to kick in and the price tanks that cheap credit is no longer available.

First is to find a wallet i.e Mycelium or Samourai and right down your private keys (show no one! The private key is your authentication) If your phone is stolen your private keys can restore it. The wallet will create public keys which you can give to people so you can receive bitcoins. The public key is what is stored in the blockchain (basically a distributed database). These particular wallets give you options for the fee when you send, the Samourai wallet in particular has very good fee customisation if this is of concern to you.

I get goose bumps thinking of the endless possibilities and the overall good for humanity decentralization will place within our society  I.e removing centralisation of trust... removes personalitys and ego's from the decisions, usually ending up in a general consensus that is good for the whole, rather than the few.

My thoughts exactly :) we are living in a debt based monetry system and have been since Nixon unpegged all currencys by taking the usd of the gold standard so the Vietnam war could actually be funded.
This system is like a tumor in a patient that grew and grew and eventually burst in 2008 and since then has been on life support. It's important to note that the tumors have multiplied and infested within the critical coma'd patient and the patients family (citizens of austerity and majority of awakened peoples of the world) no it's time to turn off that life support so we can learn and move on. Unfortunately however the doctor (governments), who have their hands on the switch to turn it off, also have a gun against their head held by a secret agent (fed/world central banks/imf) making sure the system is left on at all cost.

Btc are frozen in the blockchain when used in a sidechain.

So your acting similar to a bpay/coinbase processor, how are you going to handle the market when customers are making purchases yet the market price is in massive swing?

So if Bitpay are following the miners... but the users don't follow (because users pay miners with fees) then Bitpay is basically going to destroy their business as the user base is going to become the size of an alt. Bitmain must have them so tight by the goolies :)

Great points, I deff think having more and more on ramps into bitcoin, I.e Gemini, ATM's etc will allow more people, more easily to move quickly their deteriorating currency's while they still can before capital controls stop it completely, which is a scenario I deff see happening.
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:42:18
Well providing there are no protocol breaks, mathmatically this will eventually (soonish not so sure) become a certainty. Laws of supply and demand will also come into it. Laws of fierce competition amongst competing merchants to adopt and provide discounts to inscentivise customers to spur on adoption. Once sidechains are enabled then things will really go well as anyone can build whatever they desire,  knowing full well that they have the security of the btc network adding even further value to those satoshis that are remaining and haven't been frozen to a sidechain. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:26:41

Whatever loose change they have, use that for the initial purchase. They'll naturally monitor the $ denominated value of their purchase and as it climbs with time...realise wtf your on about.

I guess the price will rise as more people start figuring out that it is here to stay and the real implications of the technology.  There could also be certain partys who don't want this to succeed and will go to good effort to keep the prices as low as possible, although from my opinion this is great as it helps keep the entry to a whole btc more realistic for mainstream. If I were to bet on it... I prob wouldn't and use that to purchase more :p I'm long term bull and putting a time on when the price will get to x $ is really tough and I don't really know when as I'm alwaya looking farr into the future like 5, 10 20 year spans.

Yeap just do your $ purchases each week, regardless of the $ price.
Ultimately you just want to focus on how many bits you can accumulate, as the $ value will eventually become irrelevant.

No. Not only will I resist but I'll fight it tooth &amp; nail.
As a bitcoin user I don't want to remove the hundreds of Core developers that have worked tirelessly over the years to make bitcoin as robust as it is today. 
And anybody who wants to remove them certainly has no respect nor responsibility for the value bitcoin has today.

Baby steps first. ..imagine the next time the price starts to climb, I'm sure these merchants will have an option to hold a % of there coin, rather than convert all to instant fiat (bitpay option) This will only further excerpt buying pressure and if it goes reasonably high, you'll prob see employees willing to take a % of there wage in btc, could get interesting really fast.

You cannot compare Fiat, which is being printed limitlessly by central banks around the world (I'm not even going to get in to US Debt here)

Looking at the latest figures of VC funding, it's looking like the fiat is building the ecosystem pretty well already. These VC projects take time to come to fruition and when they do it's gonna be magic :)

The current monetary system the world lives on is a debt based system, each $ in existence is owed back with interest, thus settled in the bond markets of the world. This over time creates waves of inflation and constant debasement of the dollars you hold in your wallet, meaning purchases over time, for similar items, cost more and more as the years roll on.
What would happen if we had a system where money deflated or appreciated in value over time? Think of how people would purchase items? If I liked a car but knew that if I waited 6 months that car would be cheaper to purchase because my money is actually sound and going up in value, I'd happily wait until I really needed it. And so on a large scale people would only purchase items of need, not the constant wants of today. This mindset change will create investments in business and technology and many other fields that would massively benefit the people's. Think about that car I wanted and if the manufacturers knew their customers were similar thinking to myself and the enticement of bettering there product so I make that purchase today.
All in all sound money is the blood and life and the foundational building blocks of a society that is functioning correctly for its peoples and this is much needed and will be presented to humanity on a large scale in the not to distant future.

Wasn't there something about the 16 days of July? These will be talked about for generations to come... If this is correct, then I'm guessing the bond market will be involved, we're talking about the movement of many Trillions of dollars here if this is the case, which would be a hell of a ride.

They love the blockchain technology but they don't want to loose control of the supply. Ultimately they will create a coin that continues to loose value, the more things change the more they remain the same.

Because you don't know what your doing, (sorry don't mean to be rude) find a local company to do the restore for you. It will cost thousands, however much less than if you screw it and loose it all.

These are some really excellent points. 
I really think btc has the potential to change our mindsets from overspending and consuming to purchasing things that we really need. A finance model based on savings promotes less unnecessary spending, I think a deflationary economic model will generally be better for humanity in the long run, it will be a paradigm shift from how the finance system runs today and a long road but overall far better for future generations.
@_date: 2016-07-22 06:26:32
