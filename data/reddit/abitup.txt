When did I write this? Did anyone write this?  Did you assume this (yes). The only part of this thread I have contributed is this sentence -  "He is a Bitcoin supporter, which is kind of cool".  **Quit taking shit completely out of context.**  
  


   
Perhaps you should direct this comment to the person who posted this thread?  I am Canadian, I really don't give two fucks about your broken political system, publicity stunts and propaganda.   Your misguided approach to discussion in fact makes it less appealing. Good day.

Thoughts... I see a number of arguments / debates for and against.  At the end of the day, everyone, no matter who you are, is entitled to a fair trial.   
   
It is clear, through well the vast amounts of public information regarding the case that in no aspect was this a fair trial.  It was botched from the initial investigation, the court proceedings, every aspect.     
   
If you are going to prosecute someone to life, it should be through a due process.   
   
The obvious overlooking and inability to conduct a fair investigation on any level makes the OJ Simpson investigation look legitimate.

News flash! Nobody is going to come back to a shitty website!  It is up to the content creators to develop content that people come back to.  After visiting multiple times with no advancements, yes, less people will visit.  It does not take away from the value of the domain with a good site behind it.    
   
You are judging a completely blank website, with no backlinks, 0 search engine visibility, 0 content, and redirected as the hits it is getting at the moment, which is probably not a good judgement.  
   
Just a question.  If the traffic was so bad, and the potential is so shitty, what was the interest in the original contract?  Duped?  The largest Bitcoin organization "Duped" into renting a domain in which all the statisitics are publicly available... Then, proceed to do nothing with it for months, followed by emails wondering why it is not generating revenue?   
  
Even a basic bitch can smell the bullshit.

You can't really hold that against people here.  There is SO MANY reputable figures that have vouched for services that have gone under, gotten hacked or have missing coins.

Can you give Harper a call? Because in this West Coast prohibition is thriving.
@_date: 2015-05-24 17:19:25
Ummm.    
  
From what I have read, it would be the other way around.  A signed contract, that generated less revenue than expected, either due to a bad deal, or mismanagement... Not having anything on the site to generate any revenue was the first flag of mismanagement.    
   
Contract goes sour, company states on at least 10 occasions they would pay in accordance with the contract, followed by about 10 reasons why they personally think the contract is bullshit and shouldn't have to pay it.... starting with the organizations registered name, which would have been well known by the OKCoin representative originally signing anything.    
  
So, either from the get go, OKCoin was intentionally providing deceptive information, or at some point, they decided they wanted out.
   
   
Might be missing something, but it sounds like someone is trying to get rid of paying out a contract that wasn't as fruitful as they originally thought.      
Just what I have drawn from what's been posted the last few days.

@_date: 2015-05-24 05:34:33
I guess they would be affecting the price, but in my mind, the motivation lies with - the exchanges are hiring traders as a way to represent volume and encourage others to use their platform, and generate revenue (deposits, withdraws or futures and other offerings).  
  
I also see this as a positive because it provides the market with a number of exchanges with enough volume to trade on, each with unique deposit / withdraw options, catering to different users.

Once again, I agree, taxes suck ass. I don't want to pay them, but i think if you are going to say there should be 0 taxes, you should have a strategy to replace what taxes pay for in our system today, or you sound like another anarchist with no plan.   
You can say I am for taxes which I am 100% not. You can put words in my mouth, but unless you can tell me how society would function without them, they are somewhat necessary to keeping certain communal things up to date. "We all know" "the guys who are pro taxes"  your dumb ass assumptions are trying to blanket terms on groups of people that are completely different. Give it a rest.   There has to be SOME sort of mediation.  You can't just ASSUME that you don't want to pay for a hospital, the staff or supplies, but someone else will.    
   
Situation - So you shouldn't pay for a hospital this year because you didn't need it, but you will be regretting that decision when you have a heart attack. next year, too bad, nobody wanted to cover the millions to keep it running last year, just wasn't enough people DIRECTLY effected to contribute.
@_date: 2015-05-27 20:21:25
lol.  So you are going to say taxes are theft, and completely avoid providing ANY WAY at all the system would function without them.   
  
You have a point of view that you cannot rationally defend.  It's counterproductive if anything and your extreme approach really does nothing.   If you want no taxes, prepare to give a realistic way that could be achieved.   
  
Guy says "no taxes" like he's doing something for someone.

I am blocked from viewing your account.  When I click your name the user is not found.       
  
Does this have something to do with my messages to you yesterday about previous posts and affiliations?  I am just curious, because as you know I was inquiring about your affiliation to 100% known scams. Although you suggested you were not involved I find it very interesting that I cannot seem to see ANY of your history or your personal page today after our exchange.     
   
Just interesting.  History hiding is very interesting to see from somone who is trying to get me to put my currency into their financial product.   
   
I really, hope people do their research with this.  I could be wrong, but there is 10,000 red flags going off, starting with blocking people who ask questions, ending with getting angry at people for asking basic questions about your core offering that people are required to pay for.

..... Could it be  a work account?  The card has to lead to some sort of account that holds currency. Debit cards let you spend capital from a bank account, so typically linked bank accounts will be the option you are looking for.  But you can't spend debit funds online without your account number and such linked to the payment, unless it's a Visa Electron or comparable... Lets figure this out lol

I realllllly am captivated by this question.... It seems almost crucial from discussion that something has to change for future.... efficient use, but I really don't have the knowledge economically or technically to know what is best.  The question is...  
   
How do we come to the consensus to make an adjustment if need be?  I remember watching Gavin's talk at the MIT presentation and he had some super cool ideas...    
It would be cool to hear if anyone from the community if anyone has creative ideas for discussion like this to find a conclusion.

Clearly, the comment was not about Ross or the Silk Road.  Pretty quick read, not sure where ya got lost.
@_date: 2015-05-23 21:00:42
I want to agree, but there could be some technicalities. I am not a lawyer, but it looks likes OKCOIN pulled some shady shit, but did it in a strategic way to protect their asses when this happened.  If that is the case, it's super unethical, but lawfully, they might actually be fine.  Which sucks.  But ethics and laws often get mixed up in here, we need to be focusing on these unethical companies.

Should have realize I was speaking to a wall when he said taxes is theft. Road is one part.

I have used them quite a bit. Contrary to the above comment, Poker, Sportsbooks, methods of "gambling" that the player is not neccissarly  in a losing position, and with the correct knowledge can do quite well. It always surprises me that people still classify a VLT in the same context as a poker table or a sports book, they are completely different.  
   
   
Cloudbet hasn't had too much negativity in comparison.  As of late, there was a user who ws playing their live tables, and experienced a bug in which he won a significant amount, but the actual bet was never placed.  Unfortunatly, it looks as though he did not get compensated the whole amount, but CloudBet gave him something in return for finding the bug, which i believe was quite a bit lower then the bet should have paid out.   
  
I haven't really come across to many other complaints, other than the fact, the live tables are very buggy.  They run a program that most live casino's use, and I don't trust it.  
   
In my opinion, I think cloudbet is a decent place for the other games, and I wouldn't be worried if you stay away from the live games.  There is a few other options depending on what you want to play.  Best of luck and I hope it works out.

K well... I didn't find out how to actually get Bitcoin's with your bank, but my search led me to a number of Comericia customers who have had accounts closed because of Bitcoin purchases...  
Soooo. Perhaps, consider another account for your Bitcoin uses with maybe a credit union, or something on those lines, and transfer?  Or maybe load some currency on to OKPay or PErfect Money or one of those greasy financial services, they all have a quite a few methods to use.  
  
Sorry about that man, I kind of ended my search at reading people getting their accounts closed lol.  
Best of luck, don't hesitate to send a message if you have any future Q's

That was very well put.  With that in mind, I find it a little un-nerving that the judge has decided on additional time to learn about Bicoin and surrounding technology, AFTER the original proceedings and verdict, but before sentencing.   Although it might not change the verdict, I feel something is lacking in a courtroom in which the judge doesn't understand the topic being discussed.   
   
And I do agree with you, it's the law, and it needs to be enforced.  Just the same as those who have been in jail for cannabis related crimes for the last 10 years in the USA, and are finding pardons under the current system.    
   
Our world and society is changing.  If we do not update our regulatory system with it, we are going to continue to throw great minds in jail because of instances that are outdated.  
    
Yes, if he is guilty, then he provided a platform for illegal trade.  No, the penalty for connecting two users in an online transacton should probably not be considered the same circumstance as a drug kingpin working 234 - 2342 st, it doesn't make sense.  That to me is the same as referring to a Bitcoin hack as a bank robbery, which obviously occur under 2 very different contexts.
@_date: 2015-05-27 20:14:22
lol,  I am not a fan of taxes either, but at some point roads, hospitals, schools, street signs, lights, maintenance has to get paid for... How do you suggest any of this functions with no taxes? Also, if it's theft, using any of these services would make you a willing participant in the process?  
   
edit: all the people downvoting without giving one reasonable way society would function with NO taxes. It's obvious there has to be some way to account for the overhead needed for a society to function. Please, one of you downvotes, provide any sort of way this would work? There probably is some way, but all the tax haters here just love the freedoms of life but don't want to pay anything for them. Someone has to, isn't one of the smartest means to distribute expenses between the people that use them, ie tax?

Hey!   
Basically, you can create a wallet and receive direct payment, or if you are thinking of holding in for the long term there is a few options       
-List your properties on a Bitcoin store platform like Bitcoin store starter       
-Add a Bitcoin button to your current website/sales platform with a popular merchant processor.  Big volumes, what's important?  Automatic withdraw at sale rate so your finances aren't subject to volatility... Also a low withdraw rate so you are not getting nailed.      
-Or just add an app to your mobile device
   
It sounds like BitPay is perfect for you.  You can invoice, create buttons, ensure that you get the USD value of the BTC sale rate, at the time of sale, and more.   
   
Here's all of the POS options we have found -   
    
   
There is hardware options and a few apps as well.. I think for your situation it would be convenient to have a POS app on your phone -   
   
  
Coinbase and Bitpay are two services that you will probably want to look at.  There are a whole bunch more,  but these are two commercial transactors that are quite trusted from those lawfully using Bitcoin.  
   
Edit: PM me if you have any questions, the innovation in this space is endless, so there is most likely some sort of platform to cover anything you need!
@_date: 2015-05-21 23:33:52
These are all cool promotions... They need a strategy, plan of attack, and supporting something. People don't register items because they encounter them once. It would be cool to see this air drop with a goal of reach, estimated reach, a few means of connecting with the people who received them whether there is a central community online to claim them or something that encourages Bitcoin discussion between community members and prize finders..., perhaps vendors on site accepting Bitcoin, a guide of where to spend BTC in your city, where to find Bitcoin ATM's (supporting funding from those promoting)  lalalala.    
  
Some sort of strategy and analysis of what happened so next time it can be streamlined to reach more for less... and repeat and repeat with partners and repeat. Just an idea that comes to mind.  I would love to see a big team work on a complete event around an air drop though i really do love the idea.

Damn... I am not too sure =/... One option... I am not 100% on this, would be perhaps to grab a prepaid visa / mastercard with your pacheque and locate an exchange that will allow you to use prepaid... I am not 100% sure because the majority are following regulation, I am sure there must be 1 or 2 that allow it.  
   
Another option would be to grab a prepaid card and trade it for Bitcoin via reddit, bitcointalk.org or another Bitcoin community.  There is usually someone  who will trade with ya... Or even if you can email transfer from your account...   
   
Sorry just throwing everything out there that comes to my mind.

Nobody in here has the knowledge to guide this decision, and it's going to have to be a personal one.  What you think? Do you have faith in purchasing at the current rate? Bitcoin found lots of support a little lower than it is today, perhaps it would be a good idea to wait for another drop?  
  
It is very hard to guess / predict / estimate the rate of BTC.  If you do, you will be buying in confidence the adoption and usage will increase in coming months/years and Bitcoin will find a place in society that touches the mainstream further than it does today.  
  
Wish you all the best with your journey!
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:45:18
I agree!
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:09:19
I would have to agree. Processing merchant transactions without a miner fee is nuts. And charging the customer without a posted rate is very un-ethical.   
   
What exactly went wrong with BitPay?     
There is a few more... It all depends on what % you want to pay. There is a few other brands that will facilitate debit, credit, bitcoin and other ewallets all in one POS plugin, and from what it seems most follow regulation and have been around as long/longer then Bitcoin.   
 
Check em out. Sorry this happened, that can't happen for vendors. Time is money.

VC funding in my eyes - Provides a mentor, someone who has gotten to where you want to be, insight with a vested interest.   
And you can think larger.  Instead of reaching 100 people locally with your message,  perhaps the VC capital allows your to plan for extended reach, increase scale or scope of operations.  Basically the way i see it, when you have more capital, it has the potential to be used to improve/grow operations for lower cost production or something that will increase future bottom line.

Been to this place called reddit before?
@_date: 2015-05-25 03:03:31
Thought a bit more about this.  Here's my verbal diarrhea on paper lol  
  
In my mind this is the current disconnect   
  
- Vendors accepting Bitcoin, no education for customers or employees and minimal sales.       
- Vendors don't care to educate consumers, it's timely and cost intensive, and would require a bit of design and custom pamphlets... Lots don't have the resources for this. 
- Bitcoin ATM's with no vendor promotion... people see the ATM, and don't know where to spend Bitcoins.  Visa versa, people see BTC accepting Business, don't know how to get started, don't know how to get a wallet etc.    
  
   
   
This is a great opportunity for a brand to focus on connecting the community to the bitcoin ecosystem in their neighborhood. 
   
At ATM locations, signage and tangible take homes with retailers around accepting Bitcoin.  Visa versa, the retailers have pamphlets that direct their clients to the ATM's around.   
   
Focused on SPECIFIC locations/markets in SPECIFIC CITIES where bitcoin is popular to start:     
     
1. General localized Bitcoin pamphlets outlining a map of retailers, their contact, ATM's and a BASIC what is bitcoin section.. ALSO for encouragement, Bitcoin deals that are exclusive to BTC payments at retailers. These pamphlets could even double as paper wallets and be printed on a monthly basis, with estimated numbers for reach. They could be sponsored by specific brands based on the location and print schedule.      
     
2. Closely work hand in hand with Bitcoin retailers / ATM and local BTC services to host Bitcoin nights, either at a school, bar, or even rotate participating retailer businesses for bi-weekly Bitcoin meetups. I think it would be best to have one week working as a general Bitcoin night, and week working as Merchant Bitcoin night.     
    
3. Create local buzz.  I will think about this another night. But focused promotions that target a industry of individuals that will be using Bitcoin in the future for it's benefit.  Reach them once with a face to face flyer hand off, of course in a crazy context.  Now, we need to reach them 2 more times to even be considered, perhaps we target the same individuals with ads online, or during another time of the day when this segment is in another concentration.       
4.  Reach merchants for merchant night and communicate the program and the importance of getting involved with a local movement that shares clients from similar demographics. 
  
Each retailer, ATM and local BTC service could pay a monthly fee for distribution and printing services, and compensation for the bodies that are putting the design together and other overhead.  The return could be judged obviously by volume/service/transaction  comparisons, turn outs to Bitcoin nights, or could create other mediums for reference.      
   
Basically, just a group to get everyone involved locally, to bring resources together for cost effective promotions and marketing that brings each brand attention. 
   
Will put more thought into this tomorrow. Tired.
@_date: 2015-05-23 17:55:05

I actually posted this as a response to another Google trend thread that was hot this morning for a laugh but judging by the comments it's got a little serioussssss in here.  But in all honesty, I don't think we're getting anally wrecked. For a currency / value exchange with no central marketing or body to promote, Bitcoin seems to be doing absolutely amazing.  I am surprised at it's growth.  Good times.

I'm not sure why you tossed those in, didn't suggest once that those should be covered by taxes, merely stated that there is some things that are communal and require some form of communal funding.  Never referenced those once in any fashion, and actually agree 100% with what you suggested above.  Don't believe that churches, charities, associations and private assurances should be covered by everyone as they apply to select individuals. There is particular services that are used by everyone, and a moderate tax would ensure those are covered. I don't think our opinion is far off.  The radical reddit stance against anyone somewhat agreeing with a way to finance community services is dumb.  If you don't say "fuck taxes" or there should be "0 taxes" apparently you love taxes, which is not the case at all.
   
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:53:41
I see it as a positive.    
   
Distribute paper wallets to homeless, give them a map of places they can eat and buy regular goods with Bitcoins.  Load each wallet with 10$ every weekend from your house without needing to track anyone down.  Work with retailers so you can be sure the Bitcoin are going to life essentials.

@_date: 2015-05-18 16:58:27
I think this could be a super cool idea.  One of the problems they would run into would be operating costs, as a number of the ATM operators I have spoken with have voiced their need for high fees to cover costs, this would be expensive, but you would be avoiding any sort of roylty or rent with this model lol.

I think this is why it is important to have sponsorhip roles from some of the larger Bitcoin service providers, that being said, there would have to be some sort of projected ROI on the promotion, but it's tough to raise 5 million dollars with little incentive for those who donate.    
   
This is where this becomes a challenge, most other causes are driven by a business and a plan to generate profit, where as someones hard promotional work here might positively encourage use, but there is no direct benefit to the contributor.  
   
I like your idea, it would be cool to see something like this work with some contributions from some of the companies supporting the ecosystem.  I think there is room for some sort of Bitcoin promotional organization that works hand in hand with the services supporting Bitcoin for promotions, just have to find the perfect marketing mix so it's a win win for everyone involved.

@_date: 2015-05-30 16:27:53
Bitcoin exchanges are competing in a crazy environment of 100's of alternatives with a relatively small usage.  Personally, if there was an exchange in my name i would be doing the same thing.  It provides liquidity to those looking to trade Bitcoin for specific options.      
     
When I got started with Bitcoin i got BTC stuck on bter, and it was brutal, no volume to getoff, just stuck.... Bots would have prevented this.  Newbs just don't know.  Although bots drive up the volume, they also provide people a change to try new platforms and trade when they need to and ensure that there is trading on every platform catering to different currencies and deposit options....  Not in Okcoin's situation (bots not trading with people), but i think bot trading provides us more options basically.     
   
  
Now as for 99.999% of their other options... Ay ya.  Thanks for coming out and doing this.  Drama is no good, but at some point you have to air out the truth and ensure that thousands don't lose their hard earned finances, again  
@_date: 2015-05-28 15:36:50
Damn, I never thought about the exchange and user aspect to accepting the fork.   Super good read!   Still not sure about the total implications at hand. In regards to &gt;(considering adoption is relative to the blocksize)   
  
If we did reach a global scale where Bitcoin was heavily used I can't imagine we will ease into it... I think we would hit a tipping point and it would increase dramatically.    
  
I keep bumping into conflicting arguments - the block chain cannot handle # txs per day in the futute, or, that it was designed to handle growth of transactions...  Which is right?
@_date: 2015-05-27 01:35:31

Are you kidding me? Is that how you respond to people in the community supporting your service?   
  
I am going to tell you one thing.  In the customer service industry (will be 99% of your business, support) you better learn to answer these questions without sass.   I will pass, solely based on your response.    
   
Did you not read.... most likely is not a line that is going to encourage use, no i didn't , but you could have clarified in a sentence without losing a customer.   
Thanks for making the decision easy.

Or, we could stop using the radical, extreme point of views and realize that Bitcoin provides an alternative, and an innovation that could impact the occurrence these situations in the future.  Whether that may be as a currency itself, or the block chain as a transparent example, there is plenty of opportunity for positive impact on our current system, which obviously has flaws.  Some might look for ways to improve a system, and there will always be others waiting to say that won't work, to each their own.  Computer in pocket, yeah doubtful.  Buy a car over a network, ha won't happen.  Send messages back and forth though this device when i can call them on a cord phone, why would I want to.

You are right on one thing.  Yes, it's impossible to be 100% sure of everything when there is a change.  Now, if the uncertain was the reason for preventing change in every circumstance where would we be?    
   
You can't use the uncertain as a reason for not changing for what is perceived to be the better.  With every change there is going to be uncertainty.  If this was the basis for decisions nothing would ever advance.

Come up with a plan that drives profit and it will happen.  The people marketing Bitcoin steadily are the businesses making money of people using it ie. bitpay, bitcoin bowl.    
   
I agree, it would be great to have a massive marketing campaign, but there is little incentive for individual holders to put time into a marketing campaign that will cost time and money.  Maybe one day someone will come up with the correct mix that's feasible.
