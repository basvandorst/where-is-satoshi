yes, because you're looking at it in terms of dollars. if BTC is $200000 then $200 is only .001BTC

I hope they implement the ability to pay fiat to PayPal.

Seems odd to choose Bittrex for the only exchange as it isn't taking any new registrations right now. Severely limiting your potential beta user pool.

Hm, I could still make out some of the details and just barely hear the audio, I'm gonna need you to add more artifacts and really up the compression of the audio here.

You need to edit your post to change Electrum from 3.0.3 to 3.0.5.
From 2.6 to 3.0.4 Electrum had a Javascript vulnerability that would allow funds to be stolen.

I actually already have an account I made forever ago before they added the referrals.

The problem with Ripple is that it is not a crypto. It is basically fiat. It relies on user confirmation for transactions, versus blockchain confirmation.

Driving a car with that much horsepower is barely different from driving a boring sedan. The only difference really is what happens when you stomp it. Modern cars have so many assists and computers you don't have to worry about accidentally whomping it. You have to actively turn off the assists to do the fun stuff.

Looks more like a staircase than a wall.

I commented in r/btc not too long ago on a thread that was asking why Cryptopia felt the need to call Bitcoin Cash Bcash, but they weren't calling BitcoinPlus or Bitcoinfast BPlus or Bfast.
I stated it was because no one was getting on the internet and stating that Bitcoin was now renamed to one of those, unlike some proponents of Bcash.
I was downvoted and asked for sources on that.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:56:28
Oh shit, you're right.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:32:18
That still means absolutely nothing if you are just downloading a precompiled .exe. Just because Core offers that doesn't mean everyone is. All you are talking about is a proposed solution to the problem. It still doesn't negate my point unless every developer is offering that option and every user is using it.

It was also sent October 12th. So he would have been too late even if it was this year.

Everything about the crypto world is about taking risks basically. That is the cold hard truth in a field where most people are out to make as much money as possible. It is also inherent in a system where everything is intended to be anonymous.
The only true way to be "risk-free" in the crypto world is to develop all of your own software. 
Unfortunately that isn't possible for all of us.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:31:11
That is exactly what I said. If you just download the already compiled executable, like most users, there can be code deviations from the available source.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:28:53
I can definitely see your reservations, but I feel like the only person you can really trust in the crypto world is yourself. Any of the wallet makers or exchanges could snap one day and fuck all of us over. That is unfortunately the way it is in when the goal of most people is to make as much money as possible. Even an open sourced project can have hidden code if you aren't building it from the available source and using the precompiled package.

Tell him you'll take that Rx anyway. 
Might as well have some fun.

Yeah, I shapeshifted some of my alts into BCH to check out how it was going on GDAX and it took longer to confirm the transfer from my wallet to GDAX than any BTC transaction I've ever had.
I was a little pissed because BCH dropped significantly in the time the confirmation took.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:41:48
I only use it to transfer between exchanges and to use Shapeshift. So far I have had absolutely 0 problems with it. Just because something is closed source doesn't mean they have ill-intents.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:20:02
Yeah, out of every crypto I've used, LTC seems to have the fastest transactions with small fees. It was super easy to convert to fiat.
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:54:40
Again, this is not a crash.
It is a correction.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:29:11
First, the decline in value is nowhere near a crash. The USD value of 1BTC is still over $4000.
Second we're talking transactions of hundreds of thousands of a *minimum* of .01BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:41:16
Yeah, nicehash for instance.
I know a lot of people sell as soon as the transfer is confirmed.
@_date: 2017-08-08 02:02:15
Don't know what stores you're looking at, but 570s and 580s are going for $400+ from retailers and 1070s are going for $500+.

Every Tuesday when you've earned 0.01BTC and daily if you make over 0.1BTC

When I signed up they gave me $5 worth of BTC. When I rediscovered my wallet a few years later it was worth $65.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:49:38
The problem with that is paying the fees *every single time* you buy BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-06 23:53:17
I made a Coinbase account in 2014 and promptly forgot all about it.
When I made the account I used a referral link and they gave me $5 worth of BTC. $5 of BTC at the time was .02BTC. Cut to earlier this year during the ETH boom and I remember the account. Imagine my surprise when I found out my .02BTC was now worth $60 (at the time). 
I'm fully into Cryptos now.
@_date: 2017-09-09 01:17:06
Not sure if I trust you @_date: 2017-09-04 17:07:02
depends on what you're mining with. I use NH with one 1070 and average about $80 a month.
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:42:09
They sell a large amount that triggers the dip. Then when the price has reached a low point they buy it at a lower price.
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:23:42
What are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:58:11
Too bad Coinbase can't get it's shit together with Paypal withdrawals and peoples wire transfers. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 05:05:58
Pushing a 2MB hardfork is not a solution to scaling. Bitcoin should be about "finding the best solution". This is achieved through peer review, open discussion, and technical arguments. Segwit2x is none of these things: It was agreed upon in a closed door meeting, without any of the core developers.
It really does not do anything useful on to top of what BIP 141 by Core was supposed to do. It exists simply for the miners to save face, and gain control and/or respect.
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:45:13
Oh, you're a r/btc subber that thinks S2X will somehow be good for...something?
