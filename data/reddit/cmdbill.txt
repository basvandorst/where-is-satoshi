All coins can be followed up until they were generated via a solved block. To whom the address belongs to is where it gets difficult and timely.

Fact that the post at p2pfoundation.ning.com could have been a compromised account is reason for something plausible. No he doesn't owe anyone abutting, but a simple signature on the genesis block would confirm this post.

It is common for the volume to be low on the weekends. Big players with 1000k plus in bitcoins are wise to move the coins out of the exchange when not trading.

I would think that if you got your hands even on hardware that took 20 watts per gh, there would still be a ridiculous profit margin. That's if your in it to just sell the btc. The next generation of ASIC 's is going to be right around the corner. With the amount of publicity btc is getting companies such as AMD might hop on board and create chips much faster, cleaner and cheaper. BFL was making claims of "almost ready to ship" months ago, unfortunately the hardware window is closing fast as the next round of avalons is about to add 60THs to the bitcoin network effectively eating into profits BFL customers should have been getting in January. Having a highly efficient chip right now would be very low on my mining priority list.

I guess what I was trying to ask was what is the cost to do it every 10 minutes?

Ltc would support micro transactions well. When a high speed memory asic is made for ltc you could expect ltc to be something you take to the mall, while btc would be something you would take to the car dealership.

ASICs have made bot nets less profitable. Less chance for bitcoins to be mined at the expense of others. Litecoin will need ASIC miners before it is even comparable. Even then litecoin can fork way quicker. If you have been around the block, you know what a fork can do with 10 minute confirmations, imagine 2.5 minutes.

Right on!

This is just Avalon ASIC dumping their coins for cash to make the next batch of miners.

You can't use gold to shop on Amazon. You can't send cash over the internet. You can't use stocks to buy groceries. But you can use Bitcoin for all of these. Bitcoin has more than just buy and sell as an avenue. This is comparing apples to oranges. No one knew what the internet was really capable of when it was first created but yet everyone uses it now. Would you listen to a mechanic if he were trying to tell you how to fix your computer, or listen to a wall street analyst tell you if you need a heart transplant? It's NOT about what it will do for the current industry, but what it's going to change about it. In a system where banks print unlimited fiat and inflation is king, I don't think anything of what anyone says is going to make a damn difference. Bitcoin will do and go where ever the hell it wants regardless of crappy beaten down analysis.

In no way is bitcoin gambling illegal. Even according to finCEN. It is good bitcoin isn't sent directly from IP to IP otherwise this might actually mean something. In all actuality when you send a bitcoin it might be got first on a node in Kazakhstan for all you know...

It is my understanding ltc has better confirmation times and would be better for micro transactions. ASICs may exist someday for ltc even with hard hashing. Dumb gpus with fast memory will do well. Btc is running into a problem with block size 1mb to be exact. You can only fit 7 transactions per second per block if I am not mistaken. A few hundred thousand people getting Starbucks and McDonald's in the morning would eat that up. Ltc would provide a better micro transaction solution to btc. Yes the devs are saying they are looking into parsing but this would essentially take away what btc was intended to do, that's to see every transaction in the public ledger. Unless block height can be significantly increased btc might need another cryptocurrency to keep it alive. Of course this is all complete speculation and bullshit so take it with a grain of salt.

Because they profit a ton from this activity. That's why gox is saying it will take until later this year to update the trade engine. They are lying bastards and it's time for someone to rise against the gox'd up system.

Proof that not many people understand what difficulty is with Bitcoin. It doesn't matter that you will make more $ back it matters that you make the 2.2btc back. With the projections that could take some time.

That's really what it comes down to right? Difficulty would rise to fast for even 500 gh to pay off solo mining?
