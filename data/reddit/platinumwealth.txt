I just wish we could have one more moon season before 2019

HTML + PHP + CSS + basic JS.

That's the thing, I designed this site for myself (So selfish :P), but I wanted something that I can use everyday. (hence no ads and clutter, I don't care for SEO here, or ranking etc.)

Can't please all the people all the time. Need to find a happy medium.

Can you post a screenshot?
(the tables are scrollable, sideways on android)
I only tested on chrome.

I can't really fit 12 columns worth of data on a 300px width display without reducing the text font to such a size that it is not readable so I figured keep it readable and include the most valuable information on mobile only on the first view you see the coin the price, the 1 hour and 12 hour change, if you want 24 hours then you just swipe a bit. Cause I figured a mobile user would have been at a desktop at some point in the past 24 hours to view the site so they just really want a quick hourly update if they open the website on mobile.

My motivation here was that all the other sites out there are infested with ads and just too cluttered for my liking so I wanted a clean slate with just the needed info.  
Also please give me feedback about the website and if you want features to be added, I am working on setting up price alerts and a way for users to track their holdings.

Awesome sauce, glad you like it, glad it works!
What phone do you have? (I just want to make a mental note.)
