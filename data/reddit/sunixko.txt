Well it's not my fault most of reddit is from a shitty 3rd world country, it's still nice to specify as most of the world don't pay taxes on single trades
EDIT:  most of reddit user base is from other countries than US, most of people using reddit and buying crypto don't have to pay a retard US trade tax on every buy or sell!

But what about BCH? It is the supreme coin so surely it must be doing great in Satoshis?
@_date: 2019-07-04 13:25:43
Only if you live in a shitty country, most countries don't have to file taxes for every trade, just gains and losses
(fiat gains and losses*)

We don't like the lying, sure if you have knowledge about crypto, someone selling Bitcoin(BCH) you know that is not Bitcoin. For someone trying to enter the crypto market, going to Bitcoin.org, and seeing Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin; which one do you think they will belive is Bitcoin? (Yes always research before you invest, tho not everyone does) 
There's nothing called Bitcoin Core, Ver is trying to mislead people, yes people shouldn't fall for that. But he should stand for the crypto he is pushing, not steal another ones name.  
And yea, other reasons.

Good on you

You can't use most other credit cards to buy crypto. If it's an apple debit card, it's ok. Nothing to see here

I have a jailbroken iphone that I use at my daily phone. If you do something against there terms of service don't be surprised you are denied extra functions. They don't blow your phone up, get another credit card
@_date: 2019-08-03 14:16:34
Well duh, Apple has never condoned jailbreaking, you should know this by now if you didn't live under a rock

Had some problems with my 2FA, and they fixed that instabtly they confirmed my identity. Also pretty sure they are based in Japan, not that it should matter :p

Well obviously he has some knowledge on bitcoin and the blockchain as he said he believes in the technology, no one can predict the future of bitcoin and most people doing so ends up looking like fucking retards
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:27:49
He is not in control of the bitcoins 
@_date: 2018-04-05 09:11:41
Cause he is not God? Why don't you let the trial end, let this dude go to jail or go free, if he goes free he will probably get a lot of bitcoins after people get their money back. He is even saying that, if the court, ends up paying back people in FIAT, and he gets the rest of the bitcoin, he will pay you back. And maybe, just maybe you will use that money to learn to read. Like what the fuck, how can you be in this thread and not understand he does not have control of the 160k bitcoin the 
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:38:30
That is exactly what he is saying he will do 
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:31:49
Cause he ran an exchange he should be a crypto expert? And know bitcoins future?
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:16:28
Yea what is left of the bitcoins, and what will happen with them, are up to the court in Japan, I understand your frustration, but if you lost less than 100 bitcoins, you, nor I should care, they weren't worth much at that time, and that they are worth $7000 thousand each now, is not something either of us could have foreseen.  
This guy, at least from what he's saying, is if the court rules it in the way, that he ends up with the 160k bitcoins ( that is legally his at that moment), he will try to redistribute them, as good as possible, to those who owned them. That is a grand fucking gesture, considering if it's ruled that way, he is a fucking billionaire.
Now if we will take his word for it, that is another thing, if the court will rule it that way, who the fuck knows, as it stands now, you are bound to get absolutely fucking nothing(maybe the fiat value of a bitcoin at that time), but what he is trying to, is to get a CR, and redistribute the money (IN BITCOIN) to the people who rightfully owned them. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:37:01
He is also saying he will redistribute the bitcoin to those who rightfully owned them, as good as he can. Now whether he will or not we will have to see
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:42:29
Yea the technology might very well outlive bitcoin, no one knows.
