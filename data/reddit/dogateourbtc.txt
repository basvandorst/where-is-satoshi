Oh, so its not just the private keys that are encrypted? The whole wallet is not (I dont think?) Because you can still get the public addresses from it...

Thanks for all the suggestions. Sorry I didnt just link to the post. Wasn't thinking - pretty new to Reddit.
I understand that for some of you hand moving 200 addresses isnt a big deal but it's a big time consumption. I'm already working on exporting the addresses. But like I also said, the password is shared with a LTC wallet I'd PREFER not to lose.
Sorry I didnt mention which wallet - it's the linux bitcoind so our processes can interface with on the ecommerce side. For safety we didnt store the password in any files, when we need to withdraw or move funds we do it by hand.
I'll read up on how to do that memory dump, thanks rorrr, that may be very helpful. We may try installing some other wallet, doge for example, setting a password, opening the wallet up, doing a dump and see if we can find the password somewhere in the dump.
Any way to use the original vs. encrypted private keys to find the passkey? I know that encryption is not reversible - we're not trying to go from B to wherever-A-may-be - we know what A is. Just trying to find the 'way' back from B to A.
Thought it was an interesting exercise as well anyway. (I'm a fan of math and encryption technology)

Why would wallet encryption be useless? To be able to execute the attack you'd still need the unencrypted private key, which, you couldnt ever get unless you actually HAD the password in the first place. (Or had it and your dog chomped the usb key)
Not saying I'm right at all. But if I'm wrong I'd like to know why.
