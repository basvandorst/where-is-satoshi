Let me clarify by saying the first is Bitcoins Canada and the second is Libertybit.
@_date: 2013-11-06 15:30:26
Same. Namecheap.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:33:22
You should use nickel silver aka "German Silve"r.  Extremely cheap, and melting temperature is approx 1060 degrees C (or 1940 degrees F).
You can buy it here:

Forgive me, I'm not from the USA, but aren't guns readily available for anyone anyway (walmart, corner stores, hell, I visited Tucson and there were a ton of gun shops)?
What's the big deal with 3d printing a gun? 
@_date: 2013-05-18 03:59:37
I bought a domain name from you guys with BTC last month and it was awesome! Keep it up!
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:28:18
ah, and now I feel better about buying at the peak in April.
@_date: 2013-04-02 13:47:07
I'm one of those mom and pop self-employed types.  My client base is generally not that tech-savvy.  I'm instituting bitcoin even for the wee bit of extra hassle because I believe in the system.  If I have a sign out at a trade show that says "Bitcoin accepted here", it opens up a dialogue. I want to make it easy for EVERYONE to be able to buy, and this includes the people who have bitcoin and want to make it work.
@_date: 2013-05-11 01:13:47
Sorry, I think I didn't phrase correctly.
I'll rephrase my question:
Why is everyone so against 3d printing guns?  As far as I understand it, the downsides are a) minors with 3d printing access can print them, and b) they are untraceable in metal detectors.
Guns are already so available in America; why is the US Government so interested in outlawing THESE particular guns?

I will PM you when they are done. :)
Thanks for the support.

This subreddit has been the most helpful key to my being able to learn what do to in regards to bitcoin.  Anytime someone posts here, it's so exciting to read everyone's opinions, projections, doubts, etc.
I'm trying to share with others, especially as a merchant in a small community, but it's hard when you don't have quite enough technical know-how to explain things exactly right!
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:45:22
Hello, fellow vendor!
Do it! That's exactly what I'm doing this weekend. I did a show a few weeks ago and had a great response and answered a lot of questions. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:18:40
I love reading that thread and watching the different responses as the time goes on and the price increases. It goes from "YOU ARE SUCH AN IDIOT" to "OMG YOU'RE RICH YOU'RE BRILLIANT TELL US HOW MUCH YOU HAVE"
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:56:40
Thanks for responding Gary!
I used Multibit at first, and I really loved the multiple wallet function, and the simplicity of use; however, when it came to backing up my files, the rolling backups were very confusing for me. There didn't seem to be any explanation on your site or any faqs, I searched through r/bitcoin and still couldn't get it. I ended up just importing all of my backup wallets and couldn't really grasp what I could delete to keep things clean.   I was mixed up between all of the files, the .key, the .info, and the .wallet, not knowing exactly what to do.
It's totally my fault for not understanding how it all worked, but it was very confusing for my first attempt at bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-30 15:43:14
Give them way longer than that. Even if they are interested right away, it still takes a little time to figure out wallets, redeeming, security. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:23:06
I don't for sure if she's using fine silver or sterling, but whether it's 92.5 or 99.9, silver is still pricey nonetheless, and doing the work she's doing by hand is time consuming. Lots to solder, file and polish!
I see your point in offering BTC discount and I agree with you there!
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:40:33
Thanks so much for the help. Karma for you!
@_date: 2013-05-15 18:26:11
Newegg, Amazon, the place I get my metals refined, but most importantly, the grocery store!
@_date: 2013-03-29 04:10:02
It's around $90/btc now, you must be very happy!
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:45:17
I bought at the peak in April and bought when it crashed. If it crashed to 200 you'd better believe I would buy. 
I'm confident in the protocol, that's the value for me.
@_date: 2013-04-28 16:27:37
Libertybit is still going. Thank the bitlords.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:22:35
We should have a google hangout so we can all watch together
@_date: 2013-04-05 21:06:59
I really hope this is true. How beautiful!
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:17:00
I'm doing a big trade/craft show in December and will be using BTC as my hook when I send out my press releases. Wish me luck!
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:45:06
And no monthly fees!
@_date: 2013-07-11 14:53:39
I REALLY miss Libertybit too. Now they're gone I don't buy BTC due to the fees that Cavirtex has.  We need another Canadian exchange!
@_date: 2013-11-06 15:13:12
Same! All the way up, and all the way down.
@_date: 2013-04-06 23:36:18
Wow. I melt down wee scraps of gold from jewelry I find to make new jewelry pieces and I can tell you right now I started to drool when you said 45 pounds.

The handmade community is exactly who should be informed about Bitcoin.  I just finished a craft/trade show last weekend and had a QR code at my table for people to pay via Bitcoin. Not only did I get a ton of interest about it, but an elderly lady saw the sign and said "Oh! Bitcoin! I've heard of that!"...
Artisans who are full-time are GENERALLY women (from my experience in the craft show circuit), and something that gives us extremely low fees and that the transaction can be checked on our phones (which we use for credit card swiping anyway) is optimal.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:45:14
OP has a point, everything is really hostile. Come back, fun people!
@_date: 2013-05-11 00:00:33
Please do an AMA!
Forbes readers and r/bitcoin have been following your journey, but it would be received by a larger audience in IAMA.  Also, it would be awesome to ask you questions about your experience!
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:56:52


I don't think so, friend.  Exuberance is expected.  The BTC that you have, when taken the necessary precautions, can't really be taken away from you. You are in control of your wealth.
This is, of course, barring someone shoving a gun into your temple and demanding your password/knowing you've buried your paper wallets.
@_date: 2013-04-26 03:17:15
RBC wouldn't put my international remittence transfer through to Mt. Gox due to "the suspicious nature of the transfer".

If you oxidize the coin with liver of sulphur, then sand off the raised parts, you get a nice black and silver QR code.

I mined a bunch of them totally forgot the password back in July.

Sure, Pm'd.

If you mean paying for square: it's free.
If you mean using square as a POS machine: 
It's easy to just use blockchain.info as an app on your phone and have the customer scan the QR code. The funds are then deposited in your account from theirs. The Square reader itself doesn't really have anything to do with

As a merchant, I AM NOT AFRAID.

I'm finding this to be a trend among male BTC-ers in this sub lately.  Don't tell your wife/gf you have money or she'll want to spend it all! What happened to spending a life together and trusting each other?
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:39:31
So, if everything seems to be okay and BTC are all where they are supposed to be, can I manually delete the rolling backup wallets?
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:04:44
She didn't. She said she couldn't take it because she's a journalist.
What happens to it then?
@_date: 2013-05-08 16:50:27
There is a way to do it with transfer paper and ferric chloride. I'm experimenting and will do a tutorial once I have it right.

I hate to be that guy but it's:

Maybe it would give it more impact?

Congrats! I'm doing the same. It's exciting, isn't it?
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:48:37
It's because this assumes that women are not into Bitcoin already, since most people assume everyone is male by default on reddit, forums, etc.  I don't think it's "feminist trolls", but just people pointing it out.

Each jeweller has different techniques that make their prices what they are.  Sterling silver, resins, handmade findings, and certain processes all make jewelry more expensive.
You can't always tell on etsy what is handmade anymore because their policies have gotten extremely lax and there's so much reselling going on. 
If it's too expensive for you, then don't buy it, but she will find her market.
@_date: 2013-10-30 04:59:49
As a small business owner, I make it a point to tell my clients, "I take Cash, Credit Card, E-transfers, Paypal, and Bitcoin."  Then when they ask what Bitcoin is, I can explain.
It is especially helpful in the craft show circuit, since other vendors ask me what that QR code is for.  
And, yeah, I know Paypal is evil, but I would be losing out on business if I didn't take it as payment :(
@_date: 2013-05-08 01:37:33
I'm excited that the Prairies are taking notice.  We need more BTC users here!
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:25:21
Thanks so much, that would be great!
It's awesome to know that you guys are working so hard at it being available and easy to use for everyone.

Thanks for the links!
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:19:17
I didn't mean to sound defensive, it's just that handmade goods cost money to produce. 
Cost of silver + cost of resin + filing, cleaning, polishing time + retail markup (assuming she sells to stores), all come out in the price.
I know you know this because you make your own jewelry, so why do you think it's so expensive?
@_date: 2013-05-19 03:19:30
That's all I do.
(Proverbial) customer scans QR code. 
Sends money.
Check blockchain to see funds.
That's all we really need for a POS, no? No crazy gadgets beyond a cell phone and a placard.

Jeweller here. Alloyed right, gold is extremely durable and long lasting. That's why it's used. Silver is okay, but scuffs show up and it tarnished easily. Gold is far superior in jewelry making.

I'm having a difficult time with the enclosure in terms of aesthetics. From how he lifted it up and the dents in the paper, it sort of looks like a kleenex box loosely wrapped in wood printed wrapping paper.

I'm glad I split up my trading, because this morning my bank called me and told me my wire transfer was cancelled because the company I was sending to (MtGox) was "suspicious", and all wire transfers are highly scrutinized.

I've been accepting BTC since April, and only had one transaction.
I am a goldsmith/jewelry artist so the majority of my clientele are women. Unfortunately, besides myself and others in this subreddit, the proportion of women interested in Bitcoin is pretty low.
Like I said, every payment transaction is a chance to educate (not proselytize), and I've had women young and old ask me about it with genuine interest when they see the BTC sign on my table :-)
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:43:41
Where can I post my website so that people can see I accept bitcoins? What directories are there so that people can access listings based on what they'd like to purchase, ie: housewares, tech, food, supplies, clothes, whatever?
All I know of is this one: 
And this I saw in the comments: 
Any others that might be useful and highly referenced?
