I agree, that would be a super good ROI

Threehundretfourthousand not threehundretfour. I think the. instead of a, was confusing. I'm from an area where we use "."

I did not say 38.000 USD in 3 weeks. I think there are 3 different scenarios possible for each price AND time. The minimum, maximum and median for "Date of new high" mean that the current cycle should peak around 1 of those dates (not all of them). Since June 3rd is only 3 weeks ahead I even stated behind the date that I think this scenario is rather unrealistic. So in my opinion June 2nd 2020 or May 4th 2021 are more realistic, meaning the currently cycle is probably not going to be a super short one.

Basically it is a mixture of looking at the historical cycles plus adding additional, more fundamental metrics like development of the hash rate, number of transactions, number of nodes, sentiment and so on. I don't want to dive too deep into it, so let's just say it's a bit more complicated than just looking at the chart hahaha

Threehundretfourthousand is the target. We seem to come from different regions, using the "." and "," in a different way

Done, thx for pointing my head at that

Again, this is my personal opinion and I like to put my money where my mouth is. However I would never put all eggs into 1 basket and for sure I will not share any screenshots on a plattform like this
