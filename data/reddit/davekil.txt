Don't get in to Bitcoin.

...or 'hold hold hold'. My opinion is that people have so much they can't afford to lose invested in Bitcoin that it's clouding their judgement and refuse to listen to anyone else if they're not aboard the idiotic 'TO THE MOON' ship

Also they use 'invest' instead of adopt.
Bitcoin isn't an investment fund, it's a currency and for the currency to flourish it needs to be spent not hoarded, which a lot are doing (were doing?) and this is why the Mt. Gox collapse hurt.

It's the circlejerk. The same people who post memes, upvote the 'to the moon guy' and makes posts about how much money they're making on their 'investment'.
The types of people who have very little social skills and the illusion of knowledge. They would probably be good examples of the ['Dunning-Kruger Effect'](

This is great news for Buttcoin!

For people to adopt something new it has to be 'easier' than the alternatives. 
'Easier' could cover a multitude of things ranging from adopt-ability (how easy is it exchange from FIAT for Bitcoin), to using it to something a simple as it's symbol.

And the use of the word 'investment'. Bitcoin won't succeed if you treat it like a hedge fund.

The current bitcoin symbol looks very very similar to the symbol for Thai Baht

Given that it's a demo, hopefully it's optional

Is the irony that the only person to make a profit from BFL is someone outing them as a scam as opposed to anyone who actually mines bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-07-03 08:50:02
This is good for bitcoin

Some of the bodies are so old they're used as waypoints. Their clothes are still intact. 
I think a body with a red jacket is one of the more famous ones. Very interesting/disturbing stuff.

For 4 grand I'd leave all my poop up there. It costs 40k anyway

Dump now, buy low later
@_date: 2013-11-05 12:17:15
Either the guy is insanely rich or this is a windup. Nobody would react this well to losing 70 grand, nobody.

When it got to over 1200 some people were naive and said "oh this isn't a bubble" or "the crash last March was due to Mt Gox issues" and actually believed the value of BTC would never fall again.
The smugness was off the charts and being honest, I'm glad there was a small crash if only to prove a point.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:23:06
The naivety of some people baffles me a bit. 
I'm all for BTC but some of the comments I've been reading today read like people think BTC is invincible and will only ever increase in value. 
It's a bit like the housing bubble and the mindset that it was too big to fail yet throughout history each bubble resulted in a bust. 
I know they're not the same but if you view the graph of the past 12 months the crash in April had the same spike before the crash.
If BTC increases above and beyond 1k/BTC then that's great and I will applaud people for the risk and their confidence but it is naive to think that BTC is a quick investment. It's a replacement.

What do you define as 'before the peak'? January?
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:27:41
Quite a large volume sold about 6 hours ago and the fact that bitstamp is down doesn't help matters. 
I'd wait until Monday for the dust to settle.
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:20:50
Definitely. Cryptographic hashes? Public Key 101? Why would Joe Soap need to know this?
Personally, a 'wallet' isn't the best item to use when explaining bitcoin. More like a P.O. Box. It has an address that where others can send to but only you have the key to open it.
@_date: 2013-12-20 11:38:02
I love every time this gets posted it's met with 'no a bubble' 'bitcoin is different' type responses, yet the markets says different.
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:11:42
Denial, anger, bargaining, depression &amp; acceptance.
Let's see how OP progresses.

Wow, almost bought some when they were $140 earlier today.

Well one of the reasons for it's sudden increase in price was China buying a large amount of coins so it's hardly surprising to see the price go down after the recent news.
Same thing would've happened if Congress came out against Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:29:33
2% doesn't even cover inflation. Not crazy at all, just follow the advice that's posted all the time which is but BTC and just forget that it's there until a point in the future when you need it.

I'm not trying to be pessimistic here but the graph over the last 5 days looks eerily similar to the one of the last crash.
I realise most in here are thinking "I'm going to hold" but there a lot out there who look to make a quick buck.
Was the last crash a result of a trading bottleneck and panic selling?
I mean BTC are selling for near 600 on BitStamp now and as much as I would like to invest in them following the news from the U.S., it just seems too volatile to me so I'll be waiting 2 weeks to see what happens. If they go up, great but right now it seems to be people panic buying in the hope of turning a quick profit in the coming days

I don't get it...

A friend of mine works with a company who sell international phone credit which is already being accepted as payment in parts of India/Dubai.
It's still a digital currency but can also be used as actual phone credit.
So digital currencies aren't exactly a new idea over there.

It's already there but it's equal to zero
