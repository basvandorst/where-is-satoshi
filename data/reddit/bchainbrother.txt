Use Blockfolio it's a simple app. Regardless of what you use you are going to have to input data to get data out.

I wouldn't if I was you there have been to many people scammed out of bitcoin trying to. Bitcoin is a non reversible transaction. PayPal can be reversed. You send the bitcoin then the buyer contacts PayPal saying they have not received what they paid for. They get a refund and you have lost your bitcoin.

If you want credible information you look for credible articles written by credible authors written for credible people/companies. On the other hand Richard Branson started his business as a single record store owner with very little education. (Virgin Records)  London. My point being you don't have to be a Harvard Economist professor to find credible information and share it. It's these mooners and lambo chasers that generally post crap because they believe it's going to happen overnight and have tunnel vision and don't really find credible information at all. I had this guy the other day telling me a load of nonsense about the G20 summit because he read an article from a website that had advertisements displayed for cannabis. Why not do what I did, go to the G20 website and download the pdf summarising the whole meeting.

Stuck in the 9k zone? It's just hit 9k again today. How long does it have to sit at 9k to be considered stuck? A few hours? ��

You may well be right. I just know some Londoners about his age that used to buy records from his store

Yes your right. I am not formally educated in economics, I am a BSc Computing and IT student. Obviously being a university student an essential skill to learn is sourcing and being critical of credible information. I do however like to scroll through reddit to see the direction of the flock of sheep ��

No I put 100% into ADA a week ago. I'm holding long term. How about you?

I myself would put a weak resistance/strong support at 9k. 12k I would put a very strong resistance
