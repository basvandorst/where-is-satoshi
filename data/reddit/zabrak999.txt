Banging chicks, college, friends, partying, projects, hobbies, etc.
I'd rather just pay somebody to do it for me, but what's this that I stumbled upon:

HOLD ON PEOPLE!
If cloud mining has a reputation for scamming people with their "maintenance fees" etc.....
Doesn't that mean that there's room for an actual solid company to fill that gap?
In other words, why doesn't a company start a "Fidelity Investments" for the Bitcoin world? Something that's extremely consumer-friendly and won't screw you over - everybody would win, like how Fidelity did it in the real world.

Got it. Thanks bros.
Yeah, I figured what you guys mentioned was about right, though I didn't have the knowledge to articulate it.
I figure I'll invest a cool $1,000 later next year - thank you!

I was told that something called 'cloud mining' exists, and was linked here:
I just put the money in, and that service does essentially all the work for me?
And I just periodically monitor it every now and then, deciding when i want to pull out or not?
anybody know what the hell this is all about?

It's not a joke...I literally don't know anything about bitcoin lol.
It doesn't seem logical that somebody would screw me over for a short-term gain, when he can continue to do the work for me in the long run and get long-term payments from me...Then again, there are creepers out there...
How do I know who to trust??

Yeah so it appears that it's a matter of:
-Buying bitcoin vs cloud mining 
Still though, it sounds like there's definite opportunity for a Fidelity like company to do Cloud mining for the average mainstream consumer. Then once the credibility is built up along the way, perhaps the cloud mining service could be bought up by Fidelity themselves, etc
