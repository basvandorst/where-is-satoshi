I wouldn't be surprised if this was a spam attack from an nsa/ghcq operation trying to find an Achilles heel in the bitcoin network or coked up bankers trying to affect market confidence so they can buy cheap btc. 
whatever it is I'm sure it will be fixed soon.

i love this, very Bob Dobbsesque. If you can get me a high res copy of the artwork I'll print 5,000+ up and distribute them through my company to bars, pubs, cafes across the south of England. 
you can upload artwork here:

Our Father, which art in the blockchain, 
Hallowed be thy Node.
Thy Moon will come. Thy hash will be done, on earth, 
As it is encrypted.
Give us this day our daily coin. 
And forgive us our DDoSes, As we forgive them that DDoS against us. 
And lead us not into regulation, But deliver us from fiat currency inflation.
For thine is the Ledger, The processing power, and the wattage.
For ever and ever.

Amen seems so, i dunno, traditional? also it might annoy homophobic Christians. 
feel free to amend and improve upon it as you see fit :-)
