Of course, that provides more incentive for miners to have high fees.
Your money is stuck, pay up.

Ah, the MySpace value proposition.

Oh, it's definitely a thing that works.... sometimes.

If I pay someone $1,000 to dig up $1000  dollars worth of gold, there is now $2,000. The original $1000 did not disappear.
Wealth is not a zero sum game. Wealth can be created.

Bitcoin is a ledger. Ledgers have use and value. Or did you think you could pick up a globally accessible ledger for free from Walmart?

Except, unlike bitcoin, there is no reward for being an early adopter. So how will they build volume?

Do I make more money using it over another option?

19981101 is probably a date in a format similar to ISO 8601. The best date format.

Clearly I meant financial incentive. That is what will drive the market.

Most people don't act like that. If they did, Google and Amazon would be a thing. People generally value a cheaper product over privacy. Some people value privacy more.

My point is only that people will adopt something that saves them a buck.

If they made anonymous cryptocurrency illegal, how would anyone use it in a practical manner and maintain the opsec needed to not get caught?
All the government would have to do is just have routine sting operations with widely publicized convictions to keep practically everyone away.
@_date: 2019-04-16 11:20:25
I'm not saying the government could eliminate it. But they could destroy it from being practical for most people.
No one in their right mind would risk using magic internet money to buy milk from the grocery store when:
Cash/credit does the same thing
Could be a sting and land you in jail
Only "benefits" are the government can't track my milk purchase (if it's not a sting) and  I don't lose to inflation for the 5 days I held the money.

What did bitcoin do, if not this? 
@_date: 2019-01-19 16:08:22
Except lenders know that and bake it into the price of the loan.
Unexpected inflation helps debtors, but not normal inflation.

Right, for some people. People who are really into the tech and the security. But what about total noobs or tech illiterate?
What is more secure? A "password" that once it's lost your funds are gone and no one can recover them?
One that can be recovered?
Either way you run the risk of being hacked. Who do you think is more likely to be hacked, coinbase or your aunt Erma? I think Erma is the more likely victim. Now when you start asking Erma or some sketchy exchange it gets a little tougher to decide...

To be fair though, for some it is probably more secure to have their bitcoin in a place that can recover their account than in a personal wallet that they can lose.
