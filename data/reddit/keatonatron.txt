Yes, they can't be faulted for allowing the majority of these apps through. You'd need to be a bitcoin insider to realize they are scams. The breadwallet copy was pretty bad, though, because it had the _exact same_ name and logo as the real app.
All we can do is make copyright infringement claims for the apps that are pretending to be existing apps, and hope the others are mostly ignored by users.

You can't replace a key when using on-chain multisig, unless you move all the funds to new addresses (in which case we'd be able to see which keys are associated with the addresses without any help from bitfinex).

You are not arguing with me, you are presenting an argument to the public about the security of SPV clients. You are arguing people should not use SPV clients to receive high risk transactions.
I absolutely think people should be responsible and do research, but FUD and ambiguous arguments only muddle the issue and make things worse.
First, your title: "PSA: Do not use an SPV/Lite client to receive high risk transactions." This is a biased, persuasive statement. You say you want people to do their own research, but instead of saying "Research the security of SPV wallets," you instead tell people the conclusion you want them to come to. And according to you, why should people not use them? Because "they do not fully verify incoming funds." This is ambiguous--what do you mean by verify? They _do_ verify the POW is correct, and they _do_ verify that the transactions are included in a block that is deemed valid by multiple peers on the network. This is very far from simply laying out the facts so people can make their own decisions, it is a persuasive, manipulative argument.
SPV wallets being nearly secure as full nodes when receiving a transaction is an opinion--as is the opposite. There is no hard data that points one way or the other, only different interpretations of the data that is available. Theoretical data is not the same as hard data from real-world use cases.
You are presenting a persuasive argument and presenting opinion as "the facts," and that is what I took issue with. And your best defense is to shame me for not telling you who I work with.

Apple is at fault for allowing the fake app. It used the same logo and even the exact same name as the real breadwallet app. It was nearly impossible to tell the difference! It was taken down after a few days, but with hundreds of people downloading breadwallet every day, quite a few people must have downloaded it before it was deleted.
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:08:23
I had the same idea. Let developers give extra personal identity information to Apple to receive a "verified" sticker to go on their listing.
@_date: 2016-08-16 03:55:12
That makes sense. If you don't have complete control over your phone, you don't want it to be your main wallet!
If your PC is an Apple, you can run a simulated version of breadwallet which will allow you to access your funds, but copay might be easier for your situation.
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:07:17
There's really no way to do it through the software. Experienced users know how to get the correct app, it's only new people who will fall for the scams. Anything you put into the app to prove its authenticity could just be left out by the scammer and new people (who don't know what to look for) would have no idea that feature is missing.
I think the only way to really combat this is through reputation. The established wallets can request any copies be taken down, other than that we just need everyone to recommend a well-known wallet that is proven to not be a scam when introducing new users.
@_date: 2016-08-20 22:17:11
Not really... that post basically explains that the same issue came up 300 years ago and everything turned out just fine because the courts made the right decision.
It would have been perfectly reasonable for the bank to keep the note and instead give Mr. Crawfurd information about who had given them the note so he could try to take legal action against the person responsible. Bitcoin allows us to do the same, but with even more accuracy since we can trace payments. If an exchange is found to be in possession of stolen funds, which they didn't know were stolen at the time of deposit, the exchange can give up information about the account holder that deposited the funds and let the police deal with it. I would not expect the exchange to be forced to give up the funds at a loss.
The argument "blacklisting certain units of currency can ruin a monetary system" is true, but very different from "traceability ruins fungibility" which I do not think is true.

Another red herring argument (you're quite full of them!). I never said Aaron is right because of his reputation.
1. You kept telling people to do research and let the facts speak for themselves without adequately explaining what the facts are.
2. It is my opinion that people will assess facts laid out before them, or research a topic _if_ the person telling them to research it has a reputation that warrants their attention.
3. I know that within the bitcoin community Aaron has that type of reputation, but I do not know if you do. Therefore I asked about it, giving you the chance to explain to everyone else who might be reading why your arguments should be investigated further and not written off as paranoia.

I hear this statement about Bitcoin quite often, but I don't get it. Bank transfers are even more traceable and fungibility isn't affected.

You still didn't say anything about how traceability affects fungibility.
Being able to view someone's balance has nothing to do with tracing funds or fungibility. You are correct that cash is mostly untraceable, but how does that affect fungibility?

@_date: 2016-08-20 07:13:38
Depends on who you are and which transfers you want to track.
Is it your own bank account? Call up the bank and ask where your money went/came from. Are you the police and it's someone else's bank account? Call up the bank and ask where their money went/came from. Do you work at a bank? Hop on your computer and look up where the money went/came from.
@_date: 2016-08-20 18:37:36


You are correct. Banks are allowed to choose who they deal with and which customers they serve. Bitcoin exchanges have that right as well. A bitcoin exchange choosing to not serve you because the history of your money shows you did something they are legally not allowed to support does not mean the currency isn't fungible.

@_date: 2016-08-15 17:22:17
breadwallet works on phone and tablet, depending on your hardware. Why do you need access from your PC? If access from your PC is more important than the security risks, then go with copay.
Running wallet software on a PC leaves you vulnerable to malware, viruses, and hacking, but if you're very security conscious and confident you won't run into any of those things, it's probably fine.
@_date: 2016-08-20 18:30:10


Exactly. But coins are currently not being rejected based on their history--they are being rejected based on suspicions of the person holding them. And we are not moving towards global blacklists of coins that can't be used to buy a coffee*, we are moving towards financial institutions working together to catch high-profile criminals. Once stolen coins are known to no longer be in the possession of the person who stole them, they are exactly the same as any other coins.
A coin's history can give clues about the person who owns it, but the coin itself is still perfectly fungible.
*If we do end up with "I'm sorry sir, your payment was declined because it contained funds used in a gambling site 12 hops back," instead of only running into "Excuse me sir, your funds appear to be stolen from an exchange 12 transactions ago. Would you please step over here to make a statement and aid in our investigation?", I will happily admit there is a problem.
@_date: 2016-04-28 23:55:55
That is true, Lightning exchanges could be one sided (just send an updated transaction) whereas a standard Bitcoin exchange requires more back-and-forth if you want to issue a unique payment address every time. But this BIP will still be helpful with getting away from standard Bitcoin addresses for the initial exchange, even for Lightning.
@_date: 2016-08-26 05:33:59
Short answer: Breadwallet connects directly to the bitcoin network. Mycelium connects to private servers the mycelium developers maintain.

You replied to Aaron with "I'm pretty blown away that you want to risk your good reputation on what are blatantly incorrect assertions." And now you say you don't know about his reputation, and that reputations don't matter. So were you wrong yesterday or three days ago?
@_date: 2016-04-28 21:38:01
BIP75 allows for an "exchange once and forget about it" experience, just like we have with social media "friends" or the address book in an e-mail client. It could provide the same experience for the Lightning network, regardless of how frequent the exchange needs to occur.
@_date: 2016-08-20 09:19:24
I really don't. The original question was about fungibility. I never said you can't trace funds with bitcoin--you absolutely can. But no one has actually explained how that somehow ruins the fungibility of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-04-28 21:21:26
You are. The domain doesn't create any addresses, only forwards them. All addresses are created and signed by the recipient.
@_date: 2016-04-28 21:20:02
The two are unrelated. Even with Lightning, you still have to get the other person's address somehow. That's what BIP75 solves. Lightning could definitely be used within BIP75 to make address exchange more user friendly.
@_date: 2016-04-28 21:41:39
Actually, I believe it could be very useful for off-chain transactions. Even though Lightning transactions are done off-chain, the information still needs to get from one party to the other. Store and Forward servers, as presented in this BIP, would allow two participants in a transaction (on chain, off chain, Lightning or other) to exchange the information in a secure, private way, without requiring both parties to be online at the same time.
As I said below, this BIP and Lightning really aren't related, and one doesn't negate the other.
@_date: 2016-08-20 22:21:59
That's perfectly within their right. There are plenty of other places you can send your bitcoin.
Imagine you go to a store that won't accept $100 bills, but that's all you have. Does that mean the fungibility of your $100 bill is ruined? No, it just means you have to take your business elsewhere or trade it for two 50's from someone who is happy to accept a $100 bill.
@_date: 2016-04-28 21:45:33

To be fair, saying "I have received bitcoins from a variety of sources" but not naming a single source is very suspicious. You can be cooperative without giving up all privacy.
Coinbase is required by law (and their banks) to make a reasonable effort to prevent money laundering and terrorism, and they have to show why they made the decision to service a particular customer (you). If their bank or the government asks about your account, it would not go over well if they reply with "He said he doesn't keep records, and seemed like a good guy, so *shrug*". If you can at least give them _something_, they can respond with "he mentioned a few sources and none of them were from selling drugs or taking donations from terrorists, so we thought it was okay".

From my experience, in most jurisdictions the term "money transmission" means to take money from one person and give it to someone else on their behalf. If you give me $5000 and ask me to deliver it to a friend of yours because you can't or don't want to do it yourself, that is money transmission and requires a license.
As long as Bitcoin isn't classified as money, you could make the argument that a money transmitter license isn't required if you give me Bitcoin and ask that I give it to your friend. The problem is that if you hand me $5000 USD and buy Bitcoin from me that you have me send to your friend, and then I go to your friend and buy the Bitcoin back for $5000, I have just transmitted that money exactly as before except used Bitcoin's role as a loophole to keep me from requiring a license.
It looks to me like they are just trying to update the money transmitter terminology so this kind of loophole doesn't exist. Where does it say the sale of digital currency without an MT license would be illegal?
I'm not saying I'm a fan of these laws or agree with the changes, I just haven't yet been able to draw the same conclusions as you, which is why I bring up these points. I appreciate any clarification!

The amount of Bitcoins will be increasing for all our lifetimes, but that doesn't mean it will be inflationary. Inflation means the purchasing power of a currency goes down.

What do you *want* to give her? Does she know how much you have in total? If you don't want to give her a single BTC, then I don't know why you are marrying her. But on the other side, that doesn't mean you have to be willing to give her half of everything.
Make a personal decision about how much you want to share with her (because you love her and she's the mother of your child, right?) then move that amount into an address you can show her so she feels included. Consider those assets mutual, and keep everything else secret.
If you are afraid Bitcoin tracking will become wide-spread and your stash will be found out, then I guess you have to just talk it out and explain you don't want to share everything. But Bitcoin makes it pretty easy to keep assets hidden, so I would think you could just keep silent about the rest.

Possibly a little off topic, but I had to respond to this line: "In fact, I would be willing to wager that 80-90% of Mt. Gox customers would welcome a Japanese government bailout if it means a full return of their coins."
Of course they would, because they don't live in Japan! Residents of Japan accounted for less than 1% of Mt. Gox's customers. The Japanese government getting involved would have dramatic repercussions for the Bitcoin community in Japan, and the Japanese public would be horribly upset that the government had to bail out a company with 99%+ of the funds going overseas.

As I mentioned, I'm used to exchanging at Narita where you can get a fair rate even if you exchange only $10.

I only needed money to ride the train, which is why it was a small amount.

"Why would I spend 0.1%(USD 15 min) deposit fee + upto 0.5% transaction fee to pay for a coffee with bitcoins? Using fiat is cheaper, faster and easier."
Yes, if you buy $3 of Bitcoins right now and use them to pay for your coffee, the fees would make it more than $3 in fiat.
But what if you had bought your Bitcoins a few days ago when the price was a bit cheaper? You'd be spending Bitcoins you got for $2.4, instead of paying $3 in fiat.
This obviously ins't a long-term reason to use Bitcoin, but it is a valid argument when people bring up fees associated with Bitcoin. The value of Bitcoin is different for every person, depending on when they bought theirs.

"since Gox has been usually higher in price, people do not actually buy at gox"

It could also be people who were doing arbitrage before and got stuck with a large amount of cash on Gox waiting to withdraw are now going the other way.

If you released the public key together with each art piece, and even add a compartment for a slip of paper to be stored inside, people could create their own multi-sig transaction to store the funds more securely. They would have the option of using the art piece as-is, creating a multi-sig transaction with their own key and saving the second key with the art piece in the compartment, or keeping the second key separate.
As for secondary value, people interested in purchasing the piece would still be able to verify any funds stored in the single-key address displayed, and the seller would give up whatever they put into a multi-sig address, if anything.

I assume it was because he tried to send all of his bitcoin back to the atm (in which case there is none left over for the app to use as a fee, so it specifically asks if you want to send a smaller amount and use the rest for a fee).

And 1 dollar shredded into 100m pieces is equally worthless and unspendable. Sure, you can put all the pieces together to prove to the bank that it's a whole dollar and have them give you a new one in exchange, but the time and effort would cost more than the dollar is worth.
I think your reasons for non-fungibility are moot. Any fungible currency in existence is subject to mismanagement. Having an input that is too small to be sent (dust) could be equated to a grain of gold too small to be measured and valued, or a small fraction of a cent being rounded down by the bank's computer.

It could have an effect on performance (the same as everything else if net neutrality isn't maintained). If cryptocurrency communication were specifically slowed down, it would take longer for new transactions and blocks to propagate the network. If it were extreme, we would see many more orphan blocks and it would take a bit longer for payments to go through.

The simple answer is, every transaction is recorded in the blockchain. If a transaction is not recorded in the blockchain, it never happened. So no, you can not send BTC to somewhere else without including that transaction in the blockchain.

@_date: 2014-03-08 19:32:37
Why not just create a list of all the payees and make one transaction with many outputs?
The only reason I could see to split them is if you want to be able to fulfill withdrawal requests in real time. Otherwise you could collect requests for 10 minutes, create one transaction with many ouputs, and spend the next 10 mintues waiting for confirmation and collecting more requests.
@_date: 2014-04-17 08:48:52
Why does the fee matter?
The prices are still quite arbitrary. If you compare to buying coins on Bitstamp yourself, Coinbase is actually cheaper because you aren't paying the bank transfer fee. So if buying coins from Bitstamp directly is more expensive, and buying coins locally from someone is more expensive, and Coinbase is the cheapest solution possible after everything is taken into account--why do they need to lower the fees? 
If you'd rather be paying 1% less, just wait for the market price to go down by 1%. It does that every day.

I've kind of lost track of what the discussion is about. I don't think a dollar amount stored in a computer is as durable as Bitcoin, *unless* it was a distributed system like Bitcoin -- and without issuing currency from that system, as Bitcoin does, I don't know how you'd encourage people to maintain the network.
Yes, the traditional bank system is very heavily scrutinized and truthful where they need to be. But the fact that each bank holds all the keys to their own system makes it not as durable as Bitcoin, I think.

"Bitcoin is inflating. "
For now. I didn't see the monetary vs value inflation comments until after I posted, but my issue is that Bitcoin is designed to be deflationary (in value), so when people say "contrary to what you think Bitcoin is actually inflating!" it sounds like they are trying to say that Bitcoin is not doing what it's designed to do.
Yes, Bitcoin has been inflating recently, but that's a pretty small amount of time compared to our whole lives, which the OP referred to.

Not quite. If the ledger contains dollars that don't physically exist, then it is not the same because you are arbitrarily creating dollars. And if the ledger simply represents physical dollars, then again it isn't the same because if the physical dollars are stolen the ledger is meaningless.
And if you have dollars which only exist in the ledger, but can't be arbitrarily created... then you've created Bitcoin.

No. Some people even see it as a "feature," not a "bug". There hasn't yet been a *proven* attack using malleability (Mt. Gox hasn't yet released any proof!), so it's really a non-problem.

This is something I've wondered about. What about a transaction that required two keys to spend (does one person really own it if they can't spend it by themselves?) or a transaction that lets multiple people spend it (who does it belong to? Not decided until it's already spent)

TL;DR His app told him if he didn't include a miner's fee his transaction might take a long time to go through. And he didn't include it, so it took a long time to go through.
Bitcoin is still in the early stages so there is a bit of research that needs to be done before becoming a power user. Bitcoin apps should probably be a bit more newbie friendly and say something like "If you don't add a miner's fee your transaction could take longer to confirm, **up to 24 hours or more**". I think that would help people understand how important the fee is.

Of course they are free to do it, but they lost my business because I knew there were cheaper options where I was going. If they had charged no fee and only 5% I very well may have used them for the convenience.

Even the passport scans can't do much without the physical passport.

CPFP is only something the recipient can make use of. If you receive a transaction that is still unconfirmed because the fee was too low, you can spend it and include a transaction fee that is big enough for both transactions. A miner that has CPFP enabled will mine both transactions in order to get the larger fee from the second transaction.

His statement did not present any facts, so you can't "refute" it.

If he had said something concrete like the above, you could refute the statement as untrue if there is evidence to the contrary. But since he spoke in ambiguous terms, the statement must be classified as an opinion. You attempting to "refute" an opinion you don't agree with sure sounds like "opinion cleansing" to me, even though a concrete meaning wasn't presented.
(On the topic of lies, I once stated that a number of people with commit access to the main bitcoin repo also work for Blockstream, and was told "Only one of which is at BlockStream.

Yes, this is the problem. Whenever you receive money, you have to "claim" it when you try to spend it. The transaction fee is based on the size of data needed to "claim" your funds. Receiving a single transaction and then sending it out doesn't cost very much, but the amount of data required to "claim" hundreds of transactions is quite a bit and makes the transaction very expensive to send. Receiving tiny mining payouts to any wallet that connects directly to the bitcoin network is going to be expensive.
Is there an option to have Genesis combine payments into a smaller number of large payments, instead of a large number of tiny payments?

It's hard to tell without the rest of the message, but I think in this quote "you" doesn't mean "You" can also mean "you all" or "[some]one" (i.e. a hypothetical person).
In this case, Core is the someone "you" is referring to. I think what they are saying is:
"Core has an image of being out-of-touch elitists. If I were them, I would fix that first."
"[T]he most likely outcome is you get fired" could then mean "in the hypothetical statement I proposed above, if I failed to fix my image I would get fired [so this may happen to Core]."
In this case, "be fired" means the community will stop trusting Core and using Core's implementation. If there is no salary involved, "you're fired" can be used casually to mean "I no longer want you to do what I previously asked you to do"

Let's say you want to create an anonymous server with no registration required.
Users would provide a public key and give it a user-friendly name (like generating a TinyURL). If they want to delete or change their registration, they sign the request with their public key. No personal information or signup is required.
When someone wants to pay them, the payer provides the user-friendly name of the payee and the server responds with the public key on file. The payer can generate a unique public key for each transaction, and uses it to conduct an encrypted BIP70 communication flow through the server.
In the end, all the server sees is:
Someone registered a public key with a human-readable identifier. Many different public keys, which could have been from different people or all from the same person, initiated 2-way communication with that person. No other information can be seen.
Please keep in mind this is just one example of how our protocol can be used.

The two biggest obstacles to your idea: legal compliance and fraud. 
If you want to operate legally, you most likely need some kind of money transmission license in each jurisdiction where you accept credit cards or back transfers. Without it, you would quickly get shut down.
Then you need a way to make sure the person putting the money in actually owns the money and won't try to get it back after you pay them on the other side. If a bank claims a user's online banking info was compromised and they claw back the money, how will you claw back the money you've sent out on the other side? Would that even be possible? Do you personally have enough money to cover the difference until the issue is resolved?
Companies like Bitwala are for-profit for a reason. This business model is extremely expensive and time-consuming to pull off. No one can afford to do it for free.

Our BIP is just a protocol that people can use to build awesome new services. It doesn't demand anyone change the way they do things.
So you don't have to worry, current addresses will still exist and be usable by anyone.
Managing address book data will be up to developers and how they want to accomplish it. I'm sure some solutions will be more private than others.

Your quote only mentions "fabricated transactions", not bigger blocks.
The block size didn't exist when the white paper was written. Many people want to follow the chain with the most hashing power (e.g. security) just as long as it doesn't contain any fraudulent transactions.

People keep complaining about BU being untested and buggy, but there are only a handful of developers spending time on it. I can't help but think if the bitcoin community (r/bitcoin community) took BU seriously there'd be hundreds more eyes on it and all the bugs would get fixed quite quickly.
Therefore saying "Core is better because it's less buggy [and so it's not worth the time to fix the bugs in BU]" isn't a valid argument in my opinion. According to your post, your reasons for your choice had nothing to do with the differences in ideals behind the two options.

I'm getting my narrative from  If this has been debunked, then please tell me where the updated narratives are provided.
From the above:


I assume you are referring to this:


But as it says, the base block size is not increasing. If segwit is enabled but no one uses it, we will not see any increase in the number of transactions that can fit in a block. And once the 1mb limit is met with non-witness data, the only way to get more transactions into a block is to increase the base block size, and we are back to square one having the same debate we are having now. So segwit is not the solution to the block size debate--fitting more transactions in each block is just an added perk.

I'm still not saying anyone should be expected to review BU core.
As a thought exercise, what would happen if BU took control of 90% of the network? I know right now you're screaming "that would never happen!" at your computer screen, but just "what if?" If Core was forked onto a minority chain, had no hashing power, and essentially died out, what would core devs do? They would either admit "defeat" and start working on the BU project, or they would grudgingly modify Core to be compatible with BU so they could participate on the majority chain.
So all I'm saying is, the argument of "I don't agree with this alternate implementation because it isn't popular yet" isn't a good argument, as it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If everyone were to support BU instead and it therefore did become popular, it would become bug free in no time.
Other arguments against BU and its proposed way of handling things are perfectly valid.

Not quite. It creates a signed transaction that can be broadcast on the network, but not modified (meaning it can't be combined with other transactions unless the original sender is still present and willing to sign a new transaction)
A standard lightning payment channel would look like this:
1. A transaction is broadcast, committing person A's and/or B's funds to the channel
2. The amount each person owns in the channel is modified (this part is off-chain, i.e. free and instant regardless of how many updates there are)
3. A final transaction is broadcast on the network, closing out the channel.
Steps 1 and 3 mean there are 2 transactions sent to the network for each channel. If step 2 contains many updates, it lets you make all of those updates while only sending 2 transactions to the network.
However, if step 2 is only a single payment for a coffee, then using lightning would actually require two transactions be sent to the network when you could have just sent one transaction to pay for the coffee!
There are plans to set up routing, so instead of the customer opening a channel directly with Joe they would open it with a payment processor who facilitates all of the user's transactions for every merchant they visit (step 2 above). But this infrastructure most likely won't be available for a long time after Lightning is finished.

You're ignoring the analogy by poking holes in the example.
Some religious conservatives still call interracial marriages an "abomination" and don't allow or acknowledge them in their churches/families/communities. That has nothing to do with state sponsorship. 60 years ago that way of thinking was much more common, but now it is the extreme minority. The population as a whole decided that way of thinking is outdated and no longer serves the needs of society, so they changed the definition.
The block limit was added, without much discussion or fanfare, as a temporary protection long ago. It is no longer relevant, as technology has progressed and the community has grown enough to overcome the dangers against which it was meant to protect. If a large majority decides the old way of thinking no longer serves the organic, evolving, growing bitcoin community, they can certainly change that aspect of it without having to give it a new name.

This actually isn't how it works. To open the channel, you have to put up the total amount of money you might want to spend in the channel, and it gets locked away until the channel is closed. You can't use that money for anything else in the meantime, and neither can Joe. If Joe were to close the channels at the end of the day, he would still need to make one transaction for each channel, so you aren't actually saving anything unless each customer made multiple purchases.
If you are ready to lock in a certain amount of money to be used only at Joe's coffee shop, why not just buy a gift card?

There are many people around the globe (and even here in the US) who don't have a lot of savings, who tend to deal with small amounts of money and let their accounts/wallets get close to empty quite regularly. Many of these people, when getting into bitcoin, are only making one-way transactions; usually they buy a small amount ($20-50) of bitcoin and send the entire amount somewhere, emptying their wallet until the next time they buy.
This type of user doesn't have enough capital in their wallet to establish a lightning channel for the purpose of making multiple purchases, since they are spending their entire balance every time. I suspect this type of user is more numerous than most of us realize, and lightning doesn't help them.

To sell your BCoin, an exchange needs to support trading it. Any exchange that lets you sell BCoin but doesn't credit you for ACoin (or replays your ACoin and keeps it) would not last very long, so exchanges will have no choice but to support both. Problem solved! If you want to sell your BCoin, send your coin using breadwallet to the exchange, they will split off the BCoin for you and let you withdraw just the ACoin back to your breadwallet.
You are correct when saying users could accidentally send both their ABCoins to someone, but that isn't really avoidable since breadwallet is an SPV client.

You certainly could. At this point in time, only custodial wallets/services would realistically be able to split coins. If you want to dump coins on one chain, send your funds to an exchange that can split the coins for you and simply don't sell the ones you want to keep.


Let's say I buy $100 of alpaca socks. The tx is accepted on both chains. Then the chain I'm watching loses popularity and is reorged out of existence. I still have the alpaca socks and my $100 is still spent, just as I intended--how have I lost money??

_Sigh._ I'm pretty good friends with the authors of the lightning whitepaper. I *do* know how it works.
Last I heard the routing like you described hadn't really been solved. If John wants to send something to Anne, what happens if Bob isn't online?
The most practical solution is the hub-and-spoke model (hence, "lightning hub") in which case many users open channels with a central service/company that is dedicated to always being on. When John wants to send a transaction to Anne, Sally, or Bob, he simply updates the channel he already has open with the hub, and the hub updates the channel it has open with the recipient.
Problem is, the hub has to pre-allocate those funds when establishing the channel. How much should be allocated? Can the hub afford to allocate 1 btc per user? What if they have 100,000 users?
@_date: 2017-03-03 18:25:54


I'm not sure the price is always the best way to determine how things are going. Price is driven by traders on exchanges, who are sometimes disconnected from actual on-chain users. What if people are having difficulty getting their bitcoin onto exchanges to sell (due to transaction backlogs and high fees), which is creating a shortage and artificially increasing the price?
I handle customer support for a popular bitcoin wallet, and every day we get many messages from normal (non-trader) users complaining about their transactions taking many hours to go through or disappearing completely--even when they pay an adequate transaction fee. It sure doesn't sound like things are going pretty well.
@_date: 2017-03-29 22:23:29


But any block built on top​ of it will be more powerful than a replacement block due to PoW. 80% of the hashing power could be working on replacing the current block, but as soon as the other 20% finds the next block all of their work would be invalidated. Wasting time trying to replace the current block would end up giving you nothing more often than not, so logic would dictate finding the next block is the better course of action.
@_date: 2017-03-30 02:55:07


I'm not really sure, but I'm happy to help you figure it out ;) Maybe you are overlooking the fact that a transaction can't be modified without being resigned, which is why it isn't possible for the merchant to "combine all the spent transactions as inputs into a single output transaction"?
Let's look at a normal transaction of 0.1 btc sent from person A to person B:
    [ A 0.1 =&gt;B ]
Now, a payment channel (like I described before) would look like this:
    [ A 1 =&gt;channel, B 1 =&gt;channel ] (fund the channel)
    [ channel 0.9 =&gt;A, channel 1.1 =&gt;B ] (close the channel, and A has paid 0.1 to B)
From what I understand of what you are proposing, the merchant would collect individual transactions from each person and combine them. I'm assuming that you think it would look like this if 3 people paid, as a single transaction:
    [ A 0.1, C 0.1, D 0.1 =&gt;B]
The problem though, as I pointed out above, is that to create this kind of transaction A, C, and D would all need to be present to sign the new transaction. If they aren't there, B would only have 3 separate transactions, so he would have to broadcast the following:
    [ A 0.1 =&gt; B ]
    [ C 0.1 =&gt; B ]
    [ D 0.1 =&gt; B ]
    [ B 0.3 =&gt; elsewhere ]
And if they wanted to do this with payment channels, it would be a total of 7 transactions instead of 4!

"I've been receiving mining payouts to my wallet, but now that I want to spend them it's trying to charge me $15!!"
"I sent my transaction 15 minutes ago and the other side said you need to confirm, please confirm it fast because I really need the money"
I have to spend all my time trying to explain to these users what is happening, but most of them just don't get it. They think we are a crappy paypal that is trying to rip them off.
Coinbase is great because it "just works". Until now they have successfully hidden the technical bitcoin stuff from users. But as the performance of the protocol degrades, it will become more difficult to hide those issues. If users find a "better paypal" built on ethereum that's cheaper and faster than bitcoin's "marginally cheaper but not-as-fast paypal," they might switch over in droves.

Is e-mail only for large companies who have their own always-on webservers? We don't expect everyone to run their own server for receiving payments; in fact, our proposal is basically a way to allow BIP70 to be used with a third party server so users don't have to provide their own. People would sign up for a service that does the hosting for them, just like signing up for an e-mail address. The beauty of our proposal is that you can trust a third party to run the server for you without the risk of them reading the content of your messages or sending messages on your behalf, unlike a standard mail server. It would also be possible to create an anonymous server that requires no registration at all (and can still be trusted).
You are correct that BIP70 (and our service) requires the receiving device to be on to issue a payment address. However that doesn't mean you can't use it in a similar fashion to BIP47. If you are afraid the recipient might go offline, you could request 10 receive addresses in advance, and queue them up for when you want to use them. Or you could use our protocol to request a BIP32 X-pub and generate receive addresses to your heart's content--although this isn't specifically supported by our specification, I don't see any reason why you couldn't use it that way. Our protocol is meant to be flexible so developers can design services to work however they want.

Not really--the size of blocks are not increasing, the amount of data being saved in them is decreasing. Once blocks fill up again even with segwit, what then? I would argue the argument for segwit (fixing malleability, improving efficiency of stored data, etc) is comepletely separate from the argument for larger blocks (data transmission and storage technology has improved over the past few years together with number of bitcoin users, so the block size should increase as well). And indeed, most people are in support of both.
By calling segwit a block size solution, a situation has developed where people who want segwit are saying "you can't have a block increase until you accept segwit" and people who want the block increase are saying "you can't have segwit until we get our block increase". They should be separate issues and not be used to hold each other hostage.

BIP47 is an on-chain solution which requires one to send Bitcoin to the recipient to establish a connection and add additional data to the blockchain. This can weaken privacy, as anyone who knows Bob's "notification address" can see all the people who have sent Bob a notification transaction (BIP47 says the sender must send the notification transaction from an address that is not associated with them, but that can be quite difficult!). Also, sending a notification transaction to every person you may want to transact with can be costly, take a lot of time, and bloat the blockchain.
With our solution, all the back-and-forth takes place outside of the Blockchain, so privacy is preserved, communications are quick, and there are many more options for getting the message from point A to B.
Imagine 100 people go to a networking event and add each other to their wallets. Wallet developers want transactions to be able to be sent quickly, so each wallet is designed to get to work negotiating receive addresses in the background as soon as a new addressee is added.
Using BIP47, this would result in (99^2 + 99) / 2 = 4950 "notification transactions" being sent to the blockchain. Now imagine there are millions of these events going on around the world, and the number of transactions quickly becomes enough to overwhelm the Bitcoin network and cost a lot of Bitcoin.
With our solution this number of connections would be easy to handle, wouldn't cost very much, and nothing would appear on the Blockchain until an actual transaction had taken place.
One last point advantage to our system is avoiding "dead" addresses. Using the BIP47 model it would be possible for Alice to keep sending transactions to Bob even if Bob permanently loses his wallet. With our system, the recipient's wallet must be functioning for them to provide a receive address, so it becomes much harder to accidentally send funds to an outdated address (where they risk being lost forever).

I thought the mantra of BU was "we don't want to kick the can down the road / segwit adds too much technical debt," which is opposite from what you have in the orange box. Maybe the fact that it's so hard to make an accurate chart like this shows that both sides actually want the same things?
@_date: 2017-03-26 08:05:33
There is no core chain right now. Do you mean which wallets will specifically ignore blocks over 1mb? I don't think this is currently possible with an SPV wallet, so you'd have to rely on a third-party server or run your own node and point your wallet to it.

He says "I describe the mechanism that exists and that I believe will be used to deter a split (rather than the mechanism I believe ought to be used)".
This is just a prediction of what actions the miners will take in their own self-interest, not some "battle plan" devised by BU. Miners, regardless of what they are signaling, can already force a hard fork on users if they want to. The only reason they haven't is because so far there has been no compelling reason to do so. You said bitcoin is no longer interesting if the miners can force a fork, and they can, so is bitcoin no longer interesting?

SegWit is like upgrading to a 56.6k modem from a 28.8k. It improves the performance of the technology... but 56.6k is the fastest you can go on traditional analog phone lines. BU wants to skip phone line modems altogether and go straight to cable/fiber/something with more bandwidth.

Alice opens a two-way channel with the hub. Alice puts in 1BTC and the hub puts in 1BTC in a 2-of-2 multisig onchain transaction to establish the channel.
Bob does the same thing with the hub. Now bob can send money to the hub, and the hub can send money to Alice on behalf of Bob. Routing sorted! Except that Alice and Bob have both committed 1BTC, and the hub has committed a total of 2BTC which will be locked up until the channels are closed.


Nice, so only 5% remaining?




So, is that the 5% that hasn't been figured out yet?

It's meant for people who are new to bitcoin and wouldn't understand a configuration if it kicked them in the butt. You can use it as-is with no configuration, and it's one of the most secure and private wallets available.


Open the settings, go to "local currency" and swipe left on the exchange rate displayed at the top (hidden feature for advanced users)


Not really needed. It's an HD wallet and uses new addresses for every receive and a separate chain of new change addresses for every send. It mixes the order of outputs to make it harder to know which is change and which is send.


Yes, it has been open source since day one and has many community contributors: github.com/breadwallet


It's very popular. It's one of only 3 bitcoin apps in the App Store's "top apps" section for finance. (the other two are Coinbase--a custodial wallet with low privacy--and blockchain.info)

This is a great example of how much incorrect information is going around about BIP75. It does not "add KYC to Bitcoin," it lets you send along an identifying public key... **like a PGP key, for example**. If people would actually read the BIP and understand what it proposes, they would see it actually improves security and privacy.

Also save a screenshot of the receive QR code before you wipe the wallet so you can send more money to it later ;)
@_date: 2016-06-29 23:20:24
You would. But when they send you their payment address through some automated channel, how do you know it's really from them? When initiating a payment they could append the same PGP key that they used in their prior e-mail exchange with you, and sign the request so you know this request is actually coming from the same person.
Sure, they could just slap a Bitcoin address inside a PGP-encrypted e-mail and call it good, but your wallet wouldn't be able to automate that process.
@_date: 2016-06-29 22:55:42
It doesn't affect the protocol, and doesn't add AML/KYC anything. Most likely everything you've head about BIP75 is incorrect.
BIP75 encrypts communications between two parties so they can exchange Bitcoin payment addresses securely and privately. Even if the communication is encrypted, it's important to know the person at the other end is who you think it is, which is why BIP75 lets you send along a public key for verification.
Someone out there misunderstood this to mean KYC is now "baked in to the Bitcoin protocol" and that's how this whole witch hunt started.

How do we know all those payments aren't one-time payments that actually aren't suitable for LN? Sometimes a co-worker will pay me back for lunch in bitcoin, but it's only once in a while--they have no idea when they will be paying me back again or how much money in total they should allocate, so it doesn't make sense to open a lighting channel. How do we know situations like this aren't happening all over the world, accounting for a lot of the small transactions?
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:46:02

@_date: 2016-06-29 21:46:01
Exactly. "Identity" in computer terms can mean something like an IP address, e-mail address, public key, or Bitcoin address. I think people are taking it out of context and assuming we want to append people's driver's licenses to Bitcoin transactions, which is absurd.
@_date: 2017-01-26 04:24:44
I see.
I was referring more to writing down a recovery phrase for an HD wallet and keeping that safe the same way you would cash. Theymos is right, using a single-key paper wallet isn't a very good idea, but something like a breadwallet recovery phrase written down and then wiped from the phone avoids all of the problems brought up in those posts.
It's not as fast when you want to access your money as you need to do a full wallet restore, but it's definitely safe against hackers!
@_date: 2017-01-25 22:03:52


I was just referring to the length and amount of (probably-not-needed) information in your post. You could have boiled it down to 2 or 3 sentences ;)
Using any mobile wallet requires you to rely on _someone_, be it the author of the software or the team that designed the security of the phone itself. If you trust wallet devs and phone devs, you can just install the wallet software normally. If you don't trust wallet devs but do trust phone devs, you can download the source code and install it manually.
If you don't trust anyone (which it sounds like may be the case?) the best option is to not use a mobile wallet at all, and use paper-based cold storage for the majority of your funds.
You are right, it's possible to hack anything. The attack vectors for mobile wallets are quite small, but still exist. It all depends on how paranoid/cautious you want to be.

The size of the utxo set won't change, correct. But the op was about saving old transactions that are no longer in the utxo set. Pruning would get rid of all those, so you wouldn't have to download and store all of them.
@_date: 2017-01-25 07:43:18
It depends on who you trust. All binaries that get submitted to Google Play or Apple's App Store must be signed by the original author, so as long as you're sure the author is correct and you trust them, it's safe to install through these platforms (unless you're afraid of an insider at Google or Apple swapping out binaries, in which case you can't trust your phone's OS anyway!).
It's a good idea to look at the history of an app on one of these platforms to make sure the author is legit. If the app has been there for multiple years and has lots of downloads with no complaints of theft, it's probably the real deal. Recently we've seen a lot of scam wallets appearing on the App Store, but they are easy to spot because they were uploaded within the past week or so and don't have any real user traction.
As for confirming source code, there are a few options. With Android, you can get a copy of the binary from a 3rd-party apk download site (or the author themselves) and then compare a hash of the file you downloaded with a hash provided by the original author of the app. Apk's can be installed directly on Android very easily.
If you use an iphone and have a computer running OSX, it has become pretty easy to install from source code as well. All you have to do is install Xcode, download the source code, hook up your phone and press install. (omitting some details for brevity)
Yes, the concern of being scammed is legitimate, but from what we've seen so far, scammers prefer to move quickly and are therefore usually easy to spot. They tend to put out shoddily-designed, fake wallet apps and immediately steal any money people send to them before they get removed, which means a quick look at the release date and reviews is usually enough. We haven't yet seen any long-cons with wallet apps, where someone cultivates a large following and designs a truly worthwhile app before scamming everyone. They'd have to become an actual wallet dev and probably give up their identity to do that! But it's certainly not out of the question.
I hope you've enjoyed my rambling answer to your rambling question ;)

The cost of transaction fees isn't the problem, it's the symptom. Sure, you can tell people to only use bitcoin for large purchases. But what happens when there are 30 million users who want to make a single transaction per month? That adds up to around 700 transactions per minute, much more than we are currently supporting.
I'd rather test out larger blocks as a scaling option now while the user base is still small in case it's needed even with off chain transactions.

I think we should have just increased the block size limit to 8mb a couple years ago. SegWit is an overly-complicated solution to a simple problem, and 2x is too little, too late. I think BCH is a great experiment into how a larger block size would work. I wish it had started sooner so we'd have more data by now.
For a long time someone has been spinning the narrative of bigger blocks leading to centralization and censorship, but there is no evidence of that being at risk. I haven't yet heard a single good reason to keep blocks small.

Breadwallet is open source software. That means the code to make the app is freely available at github.com/breadwallet. If the app is removed from the app store, it's actually possible to download the source code and install the app directly on your phone.
So what happens if the source code goes away? I don't see how this could possibly happen unless Github shut down or was hacked maliciously, but if it did, many people have backups. If all of the backups became unavailable for some reason, you could still use your 12-word phrase in another wallet that supports BIP39 recovery phrases.
So let's take the absolute worst-case-scenario and imagine all bitcoin wallets disappear at once. Well, the technical details behind BIP39 recovery phrases are well documented and well-known, so you could still manually extract your private keys from your recovery phrase to claim your bitcoin.
Definitely a lot more secure than trusting your funds to an exchange ;)

They aren't abusing lightning. They are ruining bitcoin itself by artificially restricting it's growth and crippling performance, to make things like segwit and lightning appear essential.
I was not saying that a lightning hub run by them would be a bad thing. I was saying that letting them manipulate the network in a way that makes their lightning hub essential for even basic use is unacceptable.
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:29:56
You would have to trust the network to follow the rules, which is what we do now. If I send out counterfeit coins and 51%+ of the network accepts them, they are valid (and a 51% attack has happened).
Also, remember pruning would happen slowly. It's not like you could send out some fake bitcoin and all the nodes would say "there's no record of this... oh well!" and accept it. When you send money, there would be proof that that money is valid to send, and that the money before that was valid to send, and before that... for a few generations. It might not go all the way back to the source, but if the coins are fake and have been accepted at some point in the past, then a 51% attack has happened (just like it could happen with the current system).

It uses SHA-256 hashing, but the difficulty calculation is different. Bitcoin Cash is modified to reduce difficulty before the scheduled difficulty adjustment if blocks come out too slow. Breadwallet verifies and follows the original difficulty adjustment schedule, so it will not accept any Bitcoin Cash blocks that are mined with the lowered difficulty. Since many of these lower-difficulty blocks have already been mined, breadwallet will not follow the Bitcoin Cash chain.

True. If you are pointing out that the world's supercomputers aren't powerful enough to 51%-attack the bitcoin network, this is a valid metric to present.

Yes. If the original chain regains the most PoW (according to the original algorithm) bread will reconnect to that chain.


Bread will keep switching to whichever chain has the most PoW, and will treat the previous chain as an orphan. If you want to prevent this, you can use the node tethering option to connect your app to a node of your choosing.
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:53:38
So, tether your breadwallet to a node that follows the consensus rules you want to follow. Problem solved.

Most exchanges do not do this. They pool all the bitcoin together in storage and keep everyone's balances straight in a separate database (just like a bank!). When you request a withdrawal of your funds, they check their database to see how much you have on deposit with them, then send you that amount from their pooled storage.
I think Coinbase does things a little differently, but I don't know the details.

Keep all block headers, the last 10,000 blocks in full, plus merkle proofs for everything in the UTXO. If the network was honest, an attacker who wants to create a transaction that fraudulently creates new bitcoin (e.g. has no input but provides an output) would have two choices:
Slip it into someone else's block (the merkle tree wouldn't match up) and get a child transaction legitimately mined in a later block, or mine the original transaction in their own block. They'd then need to somehow get the network to accept it long enough to be included in the UTXO set and the evidence deleted by the pruning (10,000 blocks later).
Or, they could rewrite (re-mine) all the block headers back to the pruned area, insert their utxo into the merkle tree for a block that no longer has full data saved, and get everyone to believe their chain is the correct one (with a 51% attack, maybe?).
Either way, it sounds unlikely that an attacker would be able to fool everyone for 10,000 blocks or overpower the network with 10,000 blocks worth of mining power.

Since no one wants to actually answer your questions:
1. The safest way would be with cold storage. Since you already have breadwallet, I'll show how you can do this with breadwallet: write down your breadwallet recovery phrase and address, ensure it's correct, then erase the wallet from your phone. Even if someone watches you enter your phone's passcode then steals your phone from you, they won't be able to access your savings. 
2. Address reuse is discouraged, but if you are only receiving to that address and not spending, there is pretty much no danger to reusing the address. You are correct, you don't need to change the address on Coinbase each time.

The op was about storing all transactions forever, I explained a way to make that unnecessary. I don't see why the current network couldn't support lots of microtransactions just fine.

Oh, I see. While all that bitcoin was generated by Satoshi and sent to keys under his control, no one knows if he still has those keys, or even if he would ever consider selling the bitcoin (probably not, as he wants to remain anonymous and selling them could jeopardize his safety).

Every block has a merkle tree that can prove existence of a transaction or set of transactions in that block.
List up all transactions today that haven't been spent. Create a hash of that to save with the next block. Save the merkle tree components that prove the existence of every one of those transactions, and also save the block headers going all the way back to the genesis block. Delete everything else.
If someone wants to spend money, they have to claim which output they are spending. If it is not in the list of unspent outputs, reject their transaction. If someone wants to verify that the output actually exists in the blockchain, give them the merkle proof and all the block headers and they can verify that it all matches up.
To ensure the list of transactions that you have is correct and complete, hash it and compare with the hash that is included in the latest block. If it doesn't match, reject the block or re-sync your own data.
I think it's a much better idea than SegWit (too complicated and still grows the blockchain) or even lightning (which wasn't designed for this type of space-saving).

@_date: 2017-08-04 00:23:20
In the link you provided about immutability, the only point that has any relevance to this idea is:


In this case, it means once blocks are confirmed, the transactions should not change: the amount sent should not change, who the money was sent to should not change, transactions should not be canceled, etc.
With pruning, none of these things happen. The block's header is saved in the chain, so the existence of the block doesn't disappear. Transactions in that block can not be unsent or have their details changed. The only data that would be deleted is data for transactions that have long been closed out.
If you give a dollar to Alice, who then gives it to Bob, and everyone forgets that you gave it to Alice, has the transaction been altered? No, Bob still has the dollar and you don't. The transaction happened and has not changed, even if record of it is no longer needed.
If your argument is that full records should be saved forever, then yes, pruning would ruin that. But nowhere on the page you linked does it say all records should exist forever. It's just saying you can't go back in time and change a transaction which already happened, and with pruning you are not changing the past.


You only require the whole thing to determine everything that has ever happened, ever. If you want to know how much money you have at your disposal right now, all you need is the UTXO set. To independently verify that a transaction someone has sent you is valid, all you need is the block headers, merkle proof for the inputs, and consensus with the rest of the network that a conflicting transaction has not happened.
All three of these things could be provided in full from other nodes on the network when syncing, and the entire blockchain would not be required.

You're right, it wouldn't be called a 51% attack. That was a bad example. I just meant that if a bunch of miners today created an invalid block and all agreed to accept it, they could--the honest nodes and miners would break off, and you'd have two chains. You could then choose to follow the honest chain or the fraudulent chain.
With a pruned blockchain, the same would occur and two chains would form. You just wouldn't be able to independently verify which of the two were dishonest, unless the honest chain kept the differing block specifically for verification purposes.

That's a very astute observation. The popular silicon valley model tends to be to collect a lot of eyeballs, and figure out monetization later.

A couple years ago, fees were a mere cents and transactions in the mempool we're pretty much guaranteed to confirm. It worked great for micro transactions.

OMG why does no one actually read things?
Coinbase has repeatedly said it doesn't work they way you are claiming it will work. You are still responsible for reporting your own taxes. The IRS is not going to come knock on your door because they heard from Coinbase you owe an extra $13.50 that you didn't write down on your tax return.
Leaving something out of your tax return means you don't owe any taxes on it. If you moved the coins to your own wallet and don't owe taxes on it, then simply don't report it. It's that simple.

Hi there,
Breadwallet's recovery phrase uses "BIP39", which is a well-documented standard. Right now there are not many other wallets that use the exact same format, so it might not be easy to just plug it in to another wallet if needed, but the instructions (for technical people) are readily available, and if breadwallet were to be pulled from the app store you can be sure solutions for transferring your breadwallet phrase to another wallet will come out almost immediately. 
Hope that helps!

It wasn't presented as "donate to help my cause". The site was started by Satoshi, and managed by multiple people. It was supposed to belong to the community. Take a look at the donation page here: 
It clearly states all funds would be saved for future expenses or reinvested in the forum. And we know the money wasn't paid out to people at the time, because the forum funds were visible on the blockchain. When I Googled it, as you suggested, all I see are people asking the same questions for years and years with no resolution. See this post from 2013, where already 6000 BTC had been collected and nothing was being done:  If you have some better resources about where to see a resolution, please share.
And about it being related to Bitcoin or Reddit... The bitcointalk forum was the birthplace of the Bitcoin community, which then migrated here to Reddit. The main mod over there is now the main mod over here, so, for old-timers like myself anyway, the two are very strongly connected.

No. If you are worried, just sit tight and don't send or receive any transactions while the fork is going on.

If both chains keep going for more than a day or 2, more info about what to do is bound to come out.

Let's say you are in charge of managing a neighborhood park. You collect donations towards beautifying the park, and a bunch of people give you statues to decorate the park with. Right before work is supposed to start on the park, however, the maker of those statues passes away and their value starts increasing. You keep making plans to install the statues in the park, and keep accepting more donations, but before you know it the statues are worth millions of dollars, so you simply sell the statues and pocket the money.
Now the neighborhood visitors who donated the statues are asking what happened to them, and why they aren't installed in the park.
The bitcoin in question was collected for the purpose of improving the forum software. As soon as its value started to go up, it all disappeared and there was no more mention of the forum being improved. You are correct that it is far from criminal fraud, but if someone were to file a civil suit, claiming the money was collected under false pretenses and they want their money back, I wouldn't be surprised if they won.

Replay protection wouldn't help this, any transactions done on the legacy chain would still be lost when the new chain takes over. The only thing replay protection would do is ensure your legacy transactions have no chance of making onto the new chain.
Replay protection is only needed if you expect both chains to exist indefinitely, which in this case many do not.

I don't think OP's question was "what happens if you convert a BCH address to a BTC format and send BTC to it." I interpreted their question as "what happens if you scan a BCH address with your BTC wallet and send your BTC to it?"

You have to show proof that the intent is to do something one knows is wrong for the purpose of financial gain.

It's easy to do, actually. If you have a full node running, every transaction comes in one at a time, so all you have to do is check the address against a database of addresses you know the keys to.
Once that system is in place, just start calculating the keys and addresses for every possible brain wallet and adding them to the database. I'm sure there are people out there who have been running this system for 4+years now, so they've gotten a pretty good head start on brute forcing brainwallets.

You are correct, if you can successfully take an iTunes backup of an iOS device (this doesn't work on android), restoring the backup to the same device will restore the wallet, including the counter for the number of remaining passcode guesses.
If someone gets your phone and doesn't have the phone's passcode, it's nearly impossible for them to get access to your breadwallet. If they get your phone and _do_ have your passcode, the breadwallet passcode will seriously delay even a motivated thief who is specifically targeting your bitcoin. 
It takes quite a bit of time to restore a backup of the phone, and it must be restored to the original device (so they can't restore it on multiple devices to speed up the process). If they were simply making random guesses, in most cases you would have a few days before they could gain access to your wallet. That should give you ample time to remotely wipe the device (which will erase your wallet), or restore your recovery phrase on another device and move your funds into a new wallet.

There are two standards for 12-word phrases. Breadwallet uses BIP39 (the original standard) and the other wallets you mentioned I'm assuming use BIP44. They both take 12-word phrases, but use them in different ways to figure out "where to look" for your bitcoin. Imagine a physical wallet with multiple zippered pockets. Breadwallet only knows how to access the one on the left, and Exodus only knows how to access the one on the right, even though they are both part of the same wallet.
Generally it's not a good idea to use the same wallet seed with multiple wallets, because it increases your risk to security issues. If your wallet was compromised or had some problem, you wouldn't know which wallet (if any) caused the issue.

SPV checks proof of work and knows the current difficulty, so to do what you described you'd have to actually mine a block with your fraudulent transaction in it. That block wouldn't be valid on the main network, so you'd forfeit the block reward you could have received otherwise. Also, the person you are trying to scam would find out as soon as two blocks on the main chain were mined, since SPV also handles orphans.
Unless your victim is willing to accept 1-conf on a 12.5+ BTC payment, you'd make more money doing honest mining...
@_date: 2017-04-07 00:39:37
But homework is only valid if you did it all yourself, whereas a block hash is valid as long as it meets the difficulty requirements. Your method for finding the hash doesn't affect the validity, so why are people so upset over this?

Oh. They also ask for bank id and login if you want to use your bank account.
I too was pretty shocked the first time I was asked to log in to my bank through a third party site, but I eventually got over it. Even if I log in to my bank directly, I can't transfer a large amount of money without completing 2FA and getting notified. The worst one of these third party companies could do is see my activity, but since I make all my purchases with my credit card or bitcoin, all they'd see is salary coming in and CC bill going out...

I dislike r/bitcoin because a lot of people use fallible arguments in an attempt to "win" instead of actually debating the facts. I can respect differing opinions, but only if they are present in a fair way. The fact that you've linked to an argument fallacy shows that you, and therefore would like to debate your claims in a fair way:


I don't disagree.


A lot of core devs have ideas that I wholeheartedly disagree with, but I still think they are sane. I haven't met anyone on either side that I would consider not sane, so what is this really saying?




Compared to what? Are fees too high to prevent bitcoin from being used as an alternative to bank transfers? No. But I never send bank transfers. Are fees too high to promote growth of the industry and let bitcoin actually become a global currency? In my opinion, yes.


The future hasn't happened yet, so how can you know? Your statement sounds as if history has already shown the truth, yet the truth you claim it has shown is in the future and therefore can't be proved by history.

I disagree. I would say only the result matters, because only the result can be trustlessly verified. If the community wants to change the type of answer that is accepted so shortcuts can't be used that is one thing, but shaming someone for doing something that is perfectly within the rules of the bitcoin protocol just doesn't make sense in a system that is supposed to be decentralized and trustless.

Instead of them going to a website and accidentally buying bch (having never heard of it before), wouldn't it be better to show it to them in the wallet so you can explain the difference? You can point out the different names, colors, and logos, side by side. Then they will be prepared when they encounter it in the wild.

You also have to think about the target audience. If 95% of a wallet's users won't use (or understand) those features, it's not a good business idea to spend time adding them. If you want those features, you should choose a wallet for advanced users that supports them.

Thank you for posting some specific reasons. Let me address them:


They've had more than 2 years. There was talk of upgrading to 2mb in 2015, by Adam Back himself!
If you're looking for something more specific, announcements started coming out at least 5 months before the planned fork:
The SebWit2x team even published a checklist of things to do in preparation which has been up for two months:


So, you're going with the slippery slope argument? If we let homosexuals get married, then next people will want to marry their pets or make marriage illegal altogether?


So, slippery slope again? Women shouldn't have the right to vote, because next children and non-citizens will want to vote too?


This is hypocritical, because it's exactly what happens with core bitcoin development. 50 developers on the mailing list decide all the changes, and millions of users don't get a say.
The companies behind the NYA have customers who either will or won't buy the 2x coins they mine. They argue the users they represent do want this change. This fork is the only way to prove that. Only a malicious dictator would say there should be no elections because we already know no one wants to vote for the other guy.
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:57:36
Would you be able to provide a screenshot of that? I've never seen it but would love to know if I am wrong!
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:00:15

That's a good point, if 90% of transactions use segwit, it's probably safe to fork.
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:24:53
Thanks for the lengthy reply.


I have no idea which "precedent events" you are talking about. Also, do you understand what the term "slippery slope argument" means? Because it doesn't mean giving an example that makes people think the opposite.


"In the future we could end up with blacklisting and changed money supply" =&gt; "In the future people could want to marry their pets"
"This will open the door to more contentious forks" =&gt; "This will open the door to more voters"
I gave two separate analogies to match the original argument, following the same theme. I'm sorry if this literary argument wasn't apparent to you.


Let someone create a fork if they want to create a fork. Where the users go the money goes, and the miners will follow. If it's such an unpopular fork that no one wants to use it, it will have no value and no miners and therefore no replay issues or negative effects. If you are so sure 2x is poorly-designed and no one wants it, then let the fork happen and watch people stick with 1x!


This isn't the purpose. The purpose is to let the community vote on an alternative solution and see which one is preferred.


Again... do you know what the word "hypocritical" means? Because it doesn't mean telling someone one thing while withholding information.
This is not ideology for me. It is a belief in the free market and the idea that the best technology will win. If you're scared that "your side" will be negatively impacted, then you must think your technology is inferior.

In another tab, open  or any block explorer to see what the latest block height is. Go back to the list of nodes, and choose one that is synced up to the latest block.
Put its IP address in Bread (settings =&gt; advanced =&gt; bitcoin nodes) and check the performance.
If it seems really slow or unresponsive, choose a different node from the above list and try again.
Hopefully someone from the "no2x" camp will come up with a list of quality nodes for people to choose from, but until then this is the best I can think of.

Long ago people were proposing 8mb blocks, based on research. The core devs said "no way, we want segwit". So then the big-block proponents said "what if we increase to 2mb and also do segwit?" The core devs said "ok, we can do 2mb, but only if you let us do segwit first". So the community gave them segwit, then they said "so remember that 2mb we promised? Just kidding, we don't do that."
Segwit2x is just an attempt to do what core originally promised to do.
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:16:33
No. Breadwallet uses "SPV" mode, which means it connects directly to random nodes on the bitcoin network. This means you don't need to rely on a breadwallet server.
Each block in the blockchain includes two things (amongst others): a header hash that connects it to the previous block, and a merkle hash that can be used to prove that a specific transaction exists in the block.
Breadwallet connects to a random node on the network, and downloads all the block headers to confirm the chain of blocks is valid and in the right order. It doesn't download any transaction data at this point. (Right now, the full collection of headers is only around 40mb of data)
It then asks the node to look through each block, and send specific transaction data together with proof that it is connected to the merkle hash, therefore proving that the transaction does exist and is not being made up by the node.
Breadwallet verifies this information against a few different nodes, to make sure it all checks out.

You're right. It isn't airgapped. But if you are worried about losing coins in a fork, as long as you hold your own keys it doesn't matter where you store them if you simply refrain from making any transactions.
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:16:25
Yes. A huge majority of users don't understand a single thing about fees, they just want it to work. If their transaction gets stuck "in limbo" and the recipient doesn't show it as received yet, people get extremely worried and nervous (because hey, it's money and it's confusing). Increasing the fees to ensure those transactions go through quickly (while advanced users can mess with low fees and risk waiting a couple hours) is the only way wallet operators can make their users happy.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:42:44

As a comment on your ChainWallet idea...
If someone did steal your original key, how would you know until they stole the funds? And even if you did know they stole the key and you started hashing right after they started, they will finish before you and still steal your funds. Therefore, it doesn't offer any more protection than a single re-hashing of the key.
The only situation in which this would be helpful is if A) you have a way of knowing the key has been stolen (e.g. it only exists in physical form in your home), and B) you have a much faster ASIC than them. If they were expecting this type of protection, this second requirement seems hard to fulfill, because everyone can just buy the fastest ASIC available, and you can't add them together to go faster like you can with bitcoin mining (e.g. more money thrown at it doesn't mean more protection).
If you want a time-based solution, using a script/smart contract that enforces a time delay with an override key seems better.

I'm sure it does only work through their pool, because they've described it as not working like a normal mining pool. The whole point is to constantly generate a small amount of Bitcoin to be used in operating whatever system you're trying to build--it's not meant to mine Bitcoin for immediate sale on an exchange.
I'm just pointing out what they've publicly said. They explained the hash power and efficiency of the chip, so even if it isn't open source people will be able to confirm the amount of Bitcoin received versus the amount of electricity used to see if the numbers add up or not.

I think this is a dangerous assumption to make. r/bitcoin is the entryway for tons of brand new bitcoin users every day. This is why many people take issue with how this sub is run, it doesn't really foster a healthy environment for brand new users to come and learn about the fundamentals of bitcoin without getting inundated with political BS that they don't understand.

Let's say you have a little weather sensor set up outside your house that records temperature, wind speed, humidity, light levels and atmospheric pressure. There are many people with similar sensors around the country, essentially crowd-sourcing the collection of very detailed and accurate weather data, and there are people who want access to that data for various uses (e.g. they run an aggregate weather site, they are doing weather research, or maybe they are a self-driving cargo truck that doesn't do well in the rain and wants to repeatedly scan the next 100 miles in the direction it plans on driving).
So let's assume all the people running these sensors want to monetize it--perhaps to pay for the required electricity, or maybe the monetary incentive is what got them interested in doing it in the first place.
People who use the data need to pay for it, but they only want to pay the people who's data they actually use, and in most instances you want the entire transaction to be automated.
This is one use-case example. Each sensor could run it's own micropayments server, and when someone needs that data they can make a micropayment to receive it. The self-driving vehicle could look up exactly which sensors it wants to hear from, and pay them directly instead of subscribing to the entire nation-wide network.

Is your node set to accept bloom filters? I believe it's supposed to by default, but something to check. If Bread connects to your node and is told it doesn't accept bloom filters, it will disconnect and try again.

That's true--now that they have been around for years and penetrated everyday life. The first pre-assembled, take-home computers (like the Altair) were only purchased and understood by hardcore computer hackers, but were appealing to that group because it was easier than building your own computer from scratch.
It's my opinion that this 21 device is for techies who don't want to be so techy as to build their own. And I'm sure things will evolve from here.

I see, so it's just a brainwallet with extra hashing to impede brute forcing.
You could certainly try to launch a bip for it, but I don't think it would see much long-term success unless you could get a wallet to implement it (bips that aren't used somewhere get dropped after some time). And I do see quite a few usability issues that should cause concern for wallets; for one, if you tell users they can choose a password (the starting value) as an easy-to-remember backup, many people will choose something easy that will likely overlap with other users given enough time.
Just as with many other brainwallet improvement ideas, I think this is only really useful for personal use, and not for widespread adoption (and therefore not really appropriate for a bip).
Hope this helps!

Answer: Probably not. A more likely answer is that they are under regulatory pressure to limit the amount of money op can move. Maybe op's name just showed up on the OFAC list and they are looking into it? More info needed.

Sure. You'd also need to write the software to set up an IoT-like system for making and receiving micropayments in exchange for API access to some kind of data.

You can prevent physical theft by using multisig cold storage with each key held by a different family member/location. Then stealing the bitcoin essentially requires holding the person hostage for ransom, which has the exact same risk factor as for non-crypto people.

The exact same wallet was posted to Apple a couple days ago, with the author's name registered as Bit Coin. The description for the app said it was the first iOS wallet for bitcoin. The source code is a hastily copied breadwallet fork, with no visible commit history or documentation.
The only concrete proof would be if someone uses the wallet and gets their money stolen. None of us are willing to make that sacrifice to prove it's a scam, but it follows the patterns of other scam wallets that _have_ been proven to be scams: an author name that is designed to be misleading, an app description that is short and makes non-factual claims, no website or public presence whatsoever, built on a poorly-done breadwallet fork.

It normally syncs automatically when you restore. It looks like a combination of iOS10 and the new iPhone7 can sometimes cause the scan to not start, so you have to do it manually.
Even so, syncing does take a long time. That's currently the cost of using a wallet that connects directly to the bitcoin network and verifies all your funds independently so you aren't at the mercy of a server being run by some person you don't know. Luckily you should only have to do this very occasionally, and things will improve as technology advances.
@_date: 2016-10-19 20:28:11
It will have to. There are lots of people working on the problem, and not just because the SPV UX isn't very good.

The pool payouts is what really bothers me. An acquaintance told me their wallet wanted to charge them a $30 fee to send a couple bitcoin. I thought it must be a mistake, but when I investigated I found out they had invested in cloud mining and their wallet was trying to redeem over 1000 inputs, each for around 0.001 btc. The transaction it generated was too big to even be broadcast.
Pools that do this either don't understand how things work, or they're being greedy and trying to save on their own transaction fees by issuing payouts with the coinbase transaction.

I don't know if a rainbow attack is what you think it is...
A rainbow table is a precompiled list of hashes of dictionary words and common passwords. If you know the hash of the password you are trying to crack, you can look up the hash in the table and if you find it you know what the password is.
Rainbow tables don't exists for strings of 20 random words, names, and numbers with possible punctuation sprinkled throughout. Creating something like that would take longer than brute forcing a private key, and would be too big to store on a hard drive.
I think your arguments against this method are imperfect--it all boils down to execution. If someone were to create this type of brainwallet and save the questions and formatting in a safe, that would be no better than generating a private key with perfect entropy and saving it in your safe. The only realistic way to get at either is to break into the safe (and at least with the brainwallet, now you've got a bunch of questions to answer!).

Be very careful with a password manager. A recovery phrase that isn't stored on any computer can't be hacked, no matter what happens. Putting it into some service like a password manager instantly makes it _possible_ to be hacked, even if it's unlikely.
A recovery phrase is a lot more valuable than a password. A password can be changed quickly in an emergency, even if you can't log in. If your recovery phrase is compromised, all of your money can be stolen and they don't need access to your email or any other information like they might need with a password.

With a malicious update, it's pretty hard to claim ignorance. For the Apple App Store, you have to sign the update with your key and then submit it for review, which takes a couple days. It'd be pretty hard for the developers to claim their key and App Store login credentials were stolen and an update was uploaded, approved, and released all without their knowledge.
They could potentially claim an attacker gained remote access to their computer and changed the source code they were working on, which they themselves signed and uploaded, but that also seems quite unlikely with version control systems and multiple people reviewing all the changes being made to the code.
If it's pretty much guaranteed the developers would have the finger pointed at them if something went wrong, they'd have to be really stupid to try it. And I doubt someone that stupid could design a phone app popular enough to gain hundreds of thousands of users :)

AFAIK, no, mycelium on iOS is not nearly as secure as breadwallet. I think they do encrypt your keys at rest, but they don't use the secure enclave, meaning your wallet could be brute forced from an iCloud backup.
Breadwallet is a full-time iOS project. Mycelium is focused on Android, and it looks like they don't put much time or effort into their iOS version. It was even dropped for quite a while because they had no one to work on it.

I don't need to seek experts' advice; I've been in Bitcoin long enough and understand cryptography well enough to make my own decisions. I was simply pointing out your arguments against it weren't very powerful, and if someone is going to firmly state "Everyone -- please do not use this algorithm for your wallets."

Imagine a piece of paper. This is your recovery phrase. On the front of the paper you write down your bitcoin balance in CoPay. Then you hand the paper to breadwallet. Breadwallet uses phrases differently, so it flips the paper over, only looking at the back, and tells you there is nothing there. You go back to CoPay and send the funds to breadwallet, by erasing your balance from the front of the paper and writing it on the back of the paper. Now when breadwallet looks at the paper it sees your balance, and when CoPay looks at the paper it sees you have no balance.
Both apps can accept the same type of phrase (paper), but they use different standards for where on that phrase (paper) they should look for your balance.

I am involved, however my question above was completely neutral. I knew of Aaron before I ever met him, and there are plenty of other developers I know of but have never met. If you were having the same discussion with any of them, I would ask the exact same question. The internet is huge, and full of unqualified people stating their opinions as fact. It is impossible to investigate the legitimacy of every single claim, so reputation is what we use to decide whether or not to take someone seriously.

One thing people haven't pointed out yet is practicality: exchanges are designed for the trading of Bitcoin. They expect people to be depositing very large amounts of money, and want to ensure that gets handled properly. Withdrawing money from exchanges is not very convenient, because they assume people won't be doing it very often and they want it to be safe and secure. Trying to make an online purchase using Bitcoin from your Kraken account won't be as easy as using an actual wallet, and using it to make an in-person purchase at a store would be even worse!

It's a limitation imposed by Android. Apps in the background that continue to consume data are silently frozen after a number of seconds. It's impossible to perform an entire 15 minute sync in the backgroud--the OS simply won't allow it. We are working on ways to improve sync times, but since it is an SPV wallet we are limited by what the bitcoin network itself has to offer.
Importing an xprv might be doable. We'd have to weight the priority, though, as it's probably a feature that would be used by less than 1% of users.

It's arbitrary. You can also say $1 is 0.0015 BTC or 1,500 bits. If there have to be many digits, most people have an easier time with them on the left of the decimal point. When the price gets to $1000/BTC, one dollar would equal 1000 bits. That's pretty easy to calculate.

What is? My comment? Companies wanting to bring in more money than they spend? Or Coinbase in particular?
@_date: 2016-07-26 21:21:15
It _does_ validate the chain.
The only thing your breadwallet can't independently confirm is what transactions have already been spent--so theoretically, someone could send you a transaction that is a double spend and your wallet wouldn't know about it immediately.
However, **once your incoming transaction is confirmed, it has been validated against the entire blockchain and is independently proved to be a valid, completed transaction.**
If you are worried about trusting incoming transactions, just wait for them to confirm and then there is no doubt that you did receive the funds.

Yeah, although it can get a little ridiculous, I think it's logical. Bitcoin is a completely un-reversible payment method, which hasn't existed digitally until now. You can think of it as selling someone gold and having them walk away with it. If there's any possibility that they are using a stolen bank account or credit card and the purchase can be reversed, you're going to do everything you can to actually verify the identity of the person before they leave your store.
In a store you can compare their ID to their face, on the internet the only option is to have them send in a photo...

@_date: 2016-07-22 20:44:45
Breadwallet is designed to be very easy for new users. Security is a top priority, because new users can't be expected to understand how to keep themselves safe (since holding bitcoin is so different from other fiat-based payment apps).
If you feel Mycelium is easy to use, and you are making use of the hardware encryption they support (I don't know how to verify that), and you are careful with keeping your phone secure, then you are probably fine.
You can also try out breadwallet and see if you like it. It will ensure you have the best security available for a phone-based wallet, so you don't have to worry about whether or not you are secure.
@_date: 2016-07-28 08:15:27
How do you determine what is considered high risk?
@_date: 2016-07-23 07:34:02
If you make too many incorrect passcode attempts (8, I think, with waiting periods in between), your keys will be wiped. This is handled by the hardware on the phone, so it can't be bypassed by software. If you only have 8 attempts, I don't think there is much difference between 4 and 6 digits.

Could you explain in detail what the attack vector is? Breadwallet validates block headers and uses merkle roots to prove transactions are included in blocks. To trick it into thinking a confirmed transaction exists when it doesn't, you would have to mine a block at the current difficulty yourself.

Breadwallet uses hardware encryption so your private keys can't be stolen by malware. It verifies all the information it receives against the blockchain itself, so a malicious connection is not an issue. And if your phone is stolen, the thieves can only steal your money if they have your phone's unlock code AND your wallet's pin. Keep your recovery phrase safe, and you can always move your funds in the event your phone is stolen.

Android is not _designed_ to let one app read another app's data... but if you use malware or a virus to modify Android's source code to remove that restriction, it won't know the difference.
Breadwallet uses hardware encryption, which means even if the Android software is modified, malware and viruses can't trick it into sharing your private keys.
@_date: 2016-07-03 18:39:35
Breadwallet uses BIP39 and BIP32. If you are an advanced user, you can use a tool to generate the BIP32 private keys for a specific address in your wallet and use those to create your transaction. Everything you need exists online (but I would recommend not entering your recovery phrase into an online tool... download the source code and run it while not connected to the internet)

Money doesn't dictate my opinions. I chose to get involved because I believe in breadwallet's technology and vision.

Breadwallet connects directly to the Bitcoin network, which means it's possible that the node you've connected to is extremely slow for some reason. This hasn't been an issue until recently, so maybe the number of poor quality nodes has increased as of late. This is the downside of not relying on any centralized servers. Hopefully it will get better as we find ways to detect when a node should be dropped as a poor performer.

It won't turn into "NetkiPay", because it's an attempt at an open standard that anyone can implement. If Mycelium adds it, you won't need to change your wallet.
All BIP75 does is let you add an identifier to your payment, it is not a system for KYC. In your scenario, the only way the store could reject your payment is if you refused to join some kind of registration system and submit your account name from that system with your payment--how is this any different from Amazon requiring you to register an account before making a purchase?
I really don't think anyone is going to do something like the above, I'm just pointing out that the things people say "could be done" with BIP75 can already be done by anyone.

Nice overview.


When you first ran it, did you choose to create a new wallet? This should only take 10 seconds or less. Restoring an existing wallet takes longer, usually around 15 minutes.


You can sweep paper wallets and spend them immediately. Just scan the redeem QR code.
For recovery phrases, breadwallet uses BIP32 and BIP39. Although restoring a different wallet's phrase can be handy, I think breadwallet doesn't make that a priority because they can't vouch for the security of other wallets--it would be better to make a brand new wallet on breadwallet and send your funds over to ensure it hasn't/won't be compromised.

For one, Mycelium will run on a phone without hardware encryption. That means a percentage of mycelium users are using phones without hardware encryption, while 0% of breadwallet users are using phones that don't support hardware encryption.
Also, last I heard, Mycelium does not connect directly to the bitcoin network but instead connects to one of Mycelium's servers. The Mycelium team is completely trustworthy, but if their servers got compromised your phone could be fed malicious data. Breadwallet connects directly to the bitcoin network as an SPV wallet which is as secure as bitcoin itself.

This is not accurate. Breadwallet validates all block headers and uses merkle roots to cryptographically prove the existence of confirmed transactions. As long as you wait for the incoming transaction to confirm, you can be assured it is valid.

Taking that long to sync is not normal. Did you leave the app in the foreground? If you background it or put the phone to sleep, Android will stop it from doing its thing. When syncing and in the foreground, it will force the phone to stay awake (screen on) until it's done.
You're right, if you have a phrase and no device currently using it, you can't send the funds to breadwallet. Breadwallet is not intended to be a recovery tool which is why this wasn't a priority, but adding BIP44 support may be possible in the future.

One quirk of breadwallet is that if you try to send your funds elsewhere while the incoming transaction is still unconfirmed/awaiting confirmation, the fee to send it will be higher than usual in an attempt to get both transactions to complete faster (both transactions = in to you, and out to who you're sending it to). If you wait until the incoming transaction is confirmed before you try to use that money, the fees will be lower.
@_date: 2016-07-29 08:21:34
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:07:24
Alrighty. Thanks for explain what _you_ know about lightning.
So you have a chain of John-&gt;Bob-&gt;Sally-&gt;Anne.
Let's say John opens a channel of 2btc to Bob, Bob opens a channel of 1btc to Sally, and Sally opens a channel of 1btc to Anne. They each made one on-chain transaction and paid a $5 fee to do so.
Now John wants to send his 2btc to Anne. But he can't, because Bob's channel to Sally isn't big enough. Bob could try to increase his channel size with Sally, but he doesn't have enough money to do so unless John closes his channel first, and John would never do that since Anne didn't get paid yet.
So John's only choice is to open another channel (making another on-chain transaction and paying another $5 fee) with someone else who has more money. But John already committed all of his money to the channel with Bob, because he didn't know Bob didn't have enough money to facilitate the transfer. So now John has to close the channel and find someone else to connect with--and the closing transaction means he paid a total of $10 for fees and didn't even use the channel!
So instead lets say Bob is very wealthy and can handle larger payments between other people. John opens a 10btc channel with Bob, and Bob opens a 10btc channel with Sally. But John doesn't know if he will be paying Sally first, or if Sally will be paying him, so he asks Bob to commit 10btc to the John-Bob channel as well, just in case. Charlie and Diane, who also like the amount of money and connections Bob has, also ask Bob to open two-way channels with them. So now Bob has committed 40btc of his own money to these channels, and if channels are supposed to exist a whole year as some people say, he won't be able to access his money for a long time. Where are you going to find someone willing to be a Bob?
And now let's take a look at Frank. Frank doesn't have a lot of money, but he likes to use bitcoin for remittance to send money back home. Every payday, he buys $500 of bitcoin and sends the entire thing to his family. Lightning doesn't help Frank one bit, because every payday he would have to open a new channel with his new money, and immediately close the channel so his family can spend it. There are many Franks out there, and lightning won't help any of them, so tell me again how lightning is the savior of all our scaling woes?

Without hardware encryption, malware or a hacker who gets a hold of your phone could read your phone's memory to find your private keys and steal all of your bitcoin. With hardware encryption, your keys are never visible to the phone's software so it's impossible to read the memory to steal them.
@_date: 2016-07-23 17:43:24
Mathematically speaking you are correct, a 0.08℅ chance versus a 0.0008℅ chance. This is compounded by the attacker needing to have your phone's unlock code as well, and it takes about 48 hours to make all guesses so you have some time to restore and move the funds, unless they already know your pin and don't have to guess (in which case it doesn't matter how long it is).

$8-9 is not an average fee. $1.75 is pretty normal for a simple transaction.
Breadwallet will create a transaction to move your funds from the private key into your breadwallet, which is secured by your recovery phrase. This ensures that if you lose your phone and restore your recovery phrase on another device in the future, these funds won't be lost.
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:08:04
I'd say they are much less convenient. Who wants to carry around a second device just to make a payment?
iPhones now provide hardware encryption that is pretty close to what you can get with a hardware wallets. The only difference is your phone has an "always-on" internet connection, but with the latest malware protection and app sandboxing it shouldn't be an issue.
Close to the same security, without the need to keep a second device with you. Sounds a lot more convenient to me.

I agree with this. But I don't think it's important to know what everyone else is making. The most important thing is getting paid what _you_ think you deserve (and are worth). This is different for everyone, and is also somewhat dependent on spending habits and money management.
If everyone is paid what they think they're worth, there will most likely be a range of salaries being paid to people who do the same job. But if everyone's salary was transparent, all the people doing the same job would want to be paid the same as the highest-paid person doing that job. And if the company can't afford that, everyone's salary would probably be lowered to the average for that job. Either way, this ends up with some people getting paid less than they feel they are worth, and other people thinking they are overpaid, which can cause its own kind of stress.
Better to let everyone reflect on themselves and their own needs than to set people up to compare themselves to others.
