well I've adjusted the fee too 0.90mB per 500kb now. But still this is weird too me, what the fee should be per 500kb shouldve been decided by the company that I bought the bitcoins from. I bought bitcoins to be transfered too me not the other way around, wouldnt this be a case of what the seller has set their fee per 500kb as?
So in other words its the sellers fault that it's taking so long?
I've bought over 50 times from this seller before and never had this problem before.

OOh I got my bitcoins now, wonder if they made a child pays for parent transaction without me knowing, cuz as soon as I started to tell them it was their fault the transaction went to confirmed.

Thanks for all your help, I'm currently in chat with them whining a bit.

The transaction has been unfonfirmed for almost 24hours now.

Ok, thanks, what exactly is it that decides the fee of each transaction? Say like this one I've just linked, its a transaction from someone too me, is it the seller of Bitcoins that choose what the fee is  or is the fee decided by how much you are buying at a certain time?

Thx, guess there is nothing else to do but too wait. Guess all in all it will take around 36-48hours.

Good to know, then I can whine a bit on their shitty service then for making the transaction put too a risk where it might never even be transfered or atleast take days too weeks.

So in other words If it takes 4-5 days and it doesnt get confirmed I will get no bitcoins at all? Good thing I order from a service provider then but if it leads to that then all hell will break loose cuz they aint providing the service they state that they do.

I've got no clue at all, im using the MultiBit wallet. I dont know If I specified fee's before the transaction, I was in there changing the fee too a much higher fee per byte after the transaction, but during the transaction it was set as default 0,10mB per 500kb.
But if I'm not wrong this only adjusts the fee for what I send myself and not what I recieve or am I totally wrong?
