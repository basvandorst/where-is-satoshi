You must consider the fact GAW has raised capital via PAYCOIN and then invested into other business to clean the money/
This is no better than a money game or ponzi scheme.
Gaw simply used people funds to invest elsewhere that's the bottom line here, therefore PAYCOIN holder should report this to the authorities NOW and not wait any longer as GAW will be legally bound to provide proof to the authorities of the claims.
GoCoin should also be asked the real truth how was invested into the from GAW as that is looking all shady as well "Paybase is technically Competition to Gocoin so why would you invest into your competition and most of all accept money from the competition".
Coindesk article is great support to the pump and dump, SO I would be the last person to want to be on Coindesk as it's too selective and only posts what is valued to them and there investors.
PUMP DUMP and RIP OFF it's very unfortunate situation with GAW but they are USA Based so they are totally screwed

From reviewing a lot of posts my biggest question is about the so called 
How much was invested and why was that not made public along with all the other companies GAW has very speedily invested into.
I have not personally invested into this hit and run scheme but I am working on a project that is due to launch which I feel will now have to be delayed as this Paycoin scandel is just terrible to the crypto world.
I had the unfortunate occasion to speak to a person that lost over 300,000 USD &amp; that was very shocking based on the GAW statements as it's all vaporware.
Instead of trolling the forums go straight to the authorities pledge a complaint along with all information you are able to collect, Most of all collect information on who GAW has recently invested into example Gocoin.
Paycoin has been used to raise a large amount of funds which has been cleaned by GAW via investing into other companies.
Don't waste your time here, just go directly to FCC, FSA and the SEC.
