I know you guys are all very busy, so please don't take offense, but it would really help if there was an up-to-date guide to building and running a full node. I think a lot of people here want to run one, and now have funds to do so, but are intimidated. Often technical specs are given, but I think people just need to start by literally being told what equipment and sevices to buy and what they should do, not a spectrum of possibilities or parameters.
If you know someone who could do this for us, please send the word out. It's going to be a huge obstacle to what you guys are doing if there are a ton of people who would like to become peers but can't because the information is conflicting or they don't know where to start.
Idk if you are the guy to ask about this but I figured I would give it a shot because of your influence. Thanks.
(Btw I spam your "Three Eras of Bitcoin" article whenever it becomes relevant in discussion)

Source? That was my suspicion.

What do you think the 1 star rating is for? They honestly deserve it. I've gone back and forth over the years between trying to rationalize Coinbase's actions and admitting they are obfuscatory. I am done oscillating, Coinbase is a bad actor. The writing is on the frickin' wall man.

Thanks Trezor, really doing this space a solid. Keep up the professionalism.

Even if they have the exact same code, if the coin is not part of the same chain, it is simply *not* fungible. That's like... a major frickin feature of how blockchains work.

There is going to be a market for these things.

Honestly, this is not unique to Bitcoiners. It's an ongoing phenomenon on reddit and 4chan or any heavily trafficked forum with anonymous posting. I think the 2016 presidential election really catalyzed the fear of internet shills to a whole new level. The well has been poisoned; people don't trust that others are acting in good faith (and maybe they're right?).

**This is a shill thread.**
Check out the comments in this thread and the threads posted in other subreddits. Pretty clearly shill accounts.

Why? That makes zero sense. More people should have full nodes (I'm thinking like small business or freelancer level of income) and more people should have savings. A low economic barrier-to-entry for running full nodes and LN should help people "be their own bank"; a peer on the network.

Please, sell.

Yep, don't use and give them a big, fat 1 star rating.
