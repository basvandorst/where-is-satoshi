which means he thinks the American Dream is something those South American places should strive for and it's appropriate for those nations. Anyone who gets confused about the meaning of that quote is uneducated or deliberately misleading people.
So firstly, don't misquote people. That's bad joo-joo and it's dishonest.
Secondly, the only places I could find the quote you just mentioned were Glenn Beck websites and "libertyfirst.com" (admittedly, just from a quick search) where they *also* misquoted it in the headline, and flipped the context completely to freak people like you out for that delicious ad revenue.

@_date: 2017-12-06 20:28:25
If anything this will push people to stop using inefficient energy. That's what would have happened anyway. 
Everyone agrees that eventually, esp in the US, coal and gas will be replaced by nuclear (overdue) and solar (not ready yet) when demand hits a certain point. 
So this should just usher in that era much sooner I would think. It's actually quite capitalistic and suits the 'free market' principles the republicans love so much. 
We need more energy. Give us more and sustainable energy so we can make and use money.  
Who could disagree with that?

The people that work there are not stupid. 
There are reasons they don't accept BTC right now.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:37:57
Here's what you do:
1. Find out your credit APR (if you have consumer debt).
2. If a bank loan's APR is less than the credit APR, get a personal bank loan (which is almost always the case).
3. Pay off credit with the loan.
4. Continue to pay your debt in smaller payments now to your bank.
5. Do the minimums on student loans and car payments while putting as much as possible into retirement and Bitcoin.
By the time your Bitcoin investment is worth a lot, your student loan and car will be far less due to making regular payments and consolidating your consumer debt. You can either pay the remainder of them off or continue doing what you're doing with the confidence that you have a lot of money in savings and an investment. 
By this point you will *definitely* have paid off the personal loan as long as you made regular payments. Less bills throughout paying them, less bills over all once you've paid them, and more Bitcoin and retirement.

There is a trend now, people saying the Feds should get involved and mediate it.

The US does not like things that circumvent their control over the economy. Our CIA literally goes around killing leaders that do not agree with us, it's almost traditionally the answer.

@_date: 2017-11-27 17:12:20
Yes, in relation to the USD, however I'm talking about real situations where it stays what you're calling an unrealized gain. The asset itself is becoming useful in its own economy. I had the option of paying rent with BTC and I know people who are taking BTC as a down payment for a house. When I get food with BTC, I will be using it for my essential needs. 
And tax evasion is not really easier... If that's what you're using it for, you're in for a big surprise.
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:33:52
The point they were making is that it's unrealized gains. That distinction matters, especially in this sub where maybe .01% of users understand basic accounting and investment principles. Everyone else thinks they're in an episode of Mr. Robot.

@_date: 2017-11-27 18:09:33
1. Because it's the principle of assets. It'll stabilize at 0 or at some other number relative to some time frame. Over the course of infinite time, nothing is stable. But in some relevant time frame, you can bet the delta will be drastically smaller than it is which is relatively stable. The futures will always be profitable though because of *some* delta.
2. It's decentralized and I can send it with addresses/account numbers that I manage and don't have to hand over my SSN, etc. for. Your question is more valid for people who already have this stuff configured over several financial institutions or credit unions. That makes sense. However for people initializing something or connecting a transaction for the first time, it's much easier. The only thing that rivals it is something like Android Pay where I hover my phone over a near field communicator but that's after entering my security code, card number, expiration date, making the account to use all of this, having made a bank account already to which that card corresponds, etc.
3. "dealing of illegal goods" prove that's the main purpose. You cannot. Also, if that's going to be your argument, the USD is primarily used for corruption, human trafficking, drugs, and tax evasion by volume. That much, we *can* prove and it *has* been proven. Consumer spending is a small portion when looking at the amounts transferred to accomplish something illegal so not sure what the factor is here that you're bringing up.
The government doesn't care if it's used for illegal goods, that's silly. They'll try to do something if it threatens the USD or petrol-economy before they can wrangle it though. I think that's what you meant. Otherwise they'd just banish the US dollar because of all of those darn heroin deals and prostitutes on the street! Right? Of course not. That's naive.

@_date: 2017-11-27 14:49:32
This should be a simple concept for people to understand, I don't know why it needs repeating. 
The alternative is that if the price rises, it charges you more without permission so it seems pretty obvious.
Imagine paying X amount for bitcoin and having your statement read 400 more dollars because the price changed. That would be unacceptable.
Use your head, guys.

Wellllllllllll just sayingggggg
the bitcoin.com website is built on Wordpress which is by far the most insecure CMS platform.
*hint hint*
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:43:37
No, it has issues because of third party plugins and the people who build WP sites don't often care about maintenance which means they aren't patching things on time. 


This doesn't even make sense. Something is not vulnerable because it's most popular, I'm not going by the number of vulnerable sites using Wordpress. I'm talking about the platform itself and the standard plugins a Wordpress site uses. 
What I said is fact. Look it up on any vulnerability database. 
In fact, the version of Revolution Slider on bitcoin.com is vulnerable to shell execution exploits, I checked using WPSCAN. All someone would have to do is social engineer them into doing a manual upload and it's screwed from the inside out. 


Which CMS has more insecure deployments? I already know the answer. It's none. I just want to prove a point.

In general, and tell your GF this, do not enter any private information on a website without HTTPS. Ever. There is no reason to. Ever. Ever. Ever. It's not something you take a risk on because there is no risk. It's a 100% chance of a scam if you do it. HTTPS is standard for security because it's the law for handling financial information on the web.

@_date: 2017-11-27 14:57:26
Just wondering, since it's climbing at 1000% per year, why do you think 100,000 will take 'years'?
We can't predict the future of course but those who attempt to seem to completely ignore the evidence we *do* have. I don't understand why. If you're going to make a guess, shouldn't we use the information we currently have about the trends?
And again, trends aren't everything but they're better than a shot in the dark, especially when there is 6 years of consistency, no?
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:18:25


So? Do you expect it to just grow exponentially... *forever*? What goes up must come down.


Lol... try checking the stock charts for the companies of the 90s buddy. 


Well that's just stupid. I mean maybe for some amount of time, but no. You'd be absolutely mindless to think that bitcoin will simply grow exponentially for as long as it is around. 
Your arguments are worse than the "old timer's". At least his are grounded in some manner with respect to what we know about bubbles and booms.
Anyone who has this much of a problem with such old and basic advice as what he put out there is clearly threatened by the possibility. 
No one knows anything except that it *will* have a pull back at some point. It will *not* do what you're saying, just simply "exponentially grow". Talk about blind and reflective. Jesus. 
And FYI to anyone else reading this: Don't trust **anyone** who says something is just going to grow exponentially forever as an investment. It's probably the dumbest thing you can say about these things.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:59:54
Wait until an EMA cross over and then buy. There is no reason to believe any of use can catch a falling knife but after 3 days or more of falling value, an EMA crossover is a good sign of a real change in direction.
When those two lines push into each other again, it's likely safe.

Just because you got fucked in the ass and your lawyer didn't help you protect it doesn't mean other people will too. 
There is a whole system put in place to prevent this if you can think ahead. It's like you think it'll happen to everyone, no matter what.
It's transparent in the fact that you just come off as bitter to anyone who has their ducks in a row and their ass not fucked.
What happened is one day, *you were the idealist* and that didn't work out for you, so you assume everyone else is too and thus naive enough to pray for the best rather than just get it all in writing and encourage a dual income household philosophy from the get-go for the courts to read about in ink.
And frankly, nothing is more trusting than that. When your wife looks at you in the eyes and says, "I don't mind a prenup at all!", you've actually found the ideal without being an idealist.

@_date: 2017-11-27 15:23:52
I love it when people say I'm going to lose my money because it's one of several things:
1. Jealousy, which validates the decision to invest in BTC.
2. Fear, which is validated by people like Warren Buffett as a great time to invest.
3. They're clueless, which validates the decision to invest in BTC.
4. They're still not convinced, which makes me think BTC has room to grow as more people cave and end up getting invested, albeit at a much higher price to their dismay.
5. They believe it's too good to be true because of an inherent belief you cannot make money easily, or by simple means like a single good decision. 
So please people, keep discouraging. The polarized sentiment is hiking the price up literally every day. The psychology of it is amazing.
Now when those people stop doubting it, that's when I'll get a little spooked and begin paying attention to how often people use it for daily transactions at the store, etc. rather than an investment.

I'm a senior data scientist at the globally leading payment processor. The search and recent massive price hike being so closely correlated is not coincidence. Have fun with your freshman-level education though.


You gonna link me to the Wiki for "logical fallacies" now? How cute.


Watch it happen. Also CME would have been priced in by the very small minority of people investing in futures trading. The massive spike in Coinbase users is *not* CME investors getting excited, it's average people who heard about BTC on the news and want to get in.


There's evidence for what I'm saying and you're just parroting stuff about exchanges because "hurr durr, CME futures". BTC could tank by 50% and I would still be in the black. I have no emotional investment in this episode making a difference.
If you were right, why didn't the recent news about Nasdaq do the same thing that the CME news did? Huh, Mr. "stat class"?

I don't care about this show but I hope you're right because it would be hilarious if someone could basically guess an entire episode with one low-effort reddit comment.
Why is this on the air? It's super offensive to like... everyone as it attempts to be funny.
I remember seeing the video of "Big Bang Theory without a laugh track" on YouTube and the Indian man tells Penny to get a beer, she says "Get it yourself." (totally reasonable) and he says "Oooh, someone's been taking her bitchy pills!"
A. Not funny. "Bitchy pills"? Wat. OH THE WIT.
B. Fuck you dude. Get your own beer.
Beyond any stereotype of Indians and how people treat women, it's also just not fucking funny. Who ingests this crap?
If a dude said "You've been taking your bitchy pills" to me, a man (for not getting their beer), I'd shit on their face while they slept to display my dominance.

Yeah, any seasoned investor would be fearful by the "Even grandma is getting in on it" part on the bottom. Average people getting involved isn't a good thing. It means there's people joining because of FOMO and they'll put us in a panic spiral downward the moment the price drops 2%.

@_date: 2017-11-09 20:30:15


Well... you should have your opinion and not feel bad about it no matter how polarized you feel about something. Being centrist or moderate about something doesn't make you objective, it just makes you centrist.  
I don't wonder if I *should* or *shouldn't* feel that way. It's not really reasonable to be like "reddit for some reason doesn't like it" as if *one reason* could adequately explain why thousands or even millions of people on a website don't like it.
I don't like it, I think it's complete crap. I wasn't fooled into 'believing' that. It's simply my opinion of something for which I have my reasons. I could actually give you my reasons if you wanted and I promise they'd be more thought out than "I lost interest" which means almost nothing :P


No, I don't know. So by your logic, you've fooled yourself into thinking something is cultural snobbery because you don't understand why they don't like something? The way you talk about opinions could never be consistent on an intimately human level, not even with yourself. 
Any opinion you have, I could easily say you've 'fooled yourself into believing' that sentiment. How is that fair to the way opinions are formed? Are your reasons the only reasons that are adequate?


This makes the least sense of anything you've said. Why does not liking something mean we shouldn't talk about it? It's not like it's bad for my health or it affects me personally. I have so many curiosities about things I don't personally like or enjoy. What does that have to do with talking about it? I don't like gun violence in my home country. We should just not talk about it, then? How many things would be truly understood and sympathized if we just ignored things we don't like? 
Things seem very black and white and simple for you (you even say 'It's simple' as if you speak for everyone who likes the show). They're not. I don't make a habit of assuming people who don't like something are "fooling themselves" and partaking in "cultural snobbery", I just do what I did and ask why they like it.
What's something you don't like or enjoy? I'll just call your personal opinion "cultural snobbery" and tell you to not talk about it. That'll make no sense to you.

You don't need to mine every blockchain in search of a reward for it to be useful. You seem to think every blockchain has some peer to peer philosophy behind it and that has nothing to do with what it is. 
A blockchain can be used to simply validate the flow of information or physical goods that have receipts or a trail.
Real world example: Disney corporation uses blockchain technology at their parks to prevent theft, minimize operating loss on goods, and tracking the travel of resources from one place to another.
They eventually might offer reward for mining it for them as the blockchain gets larger but they don't have to and it would only be what they do if it's cheaper than the losses they'd have without it.
Even then, a cheap hashing algorithm would be fine for the purposes and would never need mining from people.

OP, do you realize that US debt is actually worth more than the debt because the country pays it back on time? If the US has debt and continues paying it on time with interest (which historically, the US has), it means they can borrow more and countries will continue to do it because it's basically a guaranteed source of income?
US debt is priceless. You *want* to lend to the US and the US *wants* to keep borrowing.

Customer base is not as much an incentive for Amazon as it is for other companies, I'd think that would be obvious. All of the companies that size don't care about Bitcoin. You don't see Walmart looking into it. You don't see Nordstrom or any of the major grocery stores looking into it. There's a very obvious reason for that.
So, factually, Amazon is not at a disadvantage because they don't accept Bitcoin until someone else does and that accrues a larger customer base. That's the definition of a disadvantage and they don't have that problem.

Yes that's how you run a business. Accrue capital. FYI sales are usually nothing more that selling something for a price that it shouldn't be sold for in favor of the business.

The presentation for this was tacky and loud, anyone at that restaurant was embarrassed by you or for you. 
This is not the representation of BTC that most people want. They came over to your table because you were making a scene and you didn't even explain to them in rational terms what bitcoin was. 
As someone who worked in a restaurant as a kid, 100% chance they just thought you were dodging your bill. 
Conduct yourself better and maybe this would matter but as of right now, this video isn't impressing anyone. It makes BTC advocates look like absolutely drunk idiots. 
Not to mention spending 1K to make a point without ever actually making that point is a really expensive way to accomplish nothing. They're not going to accept BTC after this because the only person who ever brought it to their attention made a scene and *that's* all they're going to remember.
As someone else said:

A super small segment of that group, I guess? Kind of a useless generalization. The "millennial crowd" statistically doesn't even have more than 2K in savings on average so I'm not sure what your point is here.


Is that why I have thousands of dollars invested in it? You're just throwing around assumptions because I don't think retailers have an economic obligation to accept BTC which has nothing to do with what *I* think it is or could be. Not only am I invested, I'm building software that leverages the BTC crowd like you to make *me* more money. I fully understand the potential.
You seem to have an emotional, subjective opinion on most of these issues. Not a grounded, rational one. 
Besides, BTC isn't anonymous and things like Monero are. BTC is going to be more vulnerable as machines get more powerful and there is little patching to the protocol can do about that. The value is in the trust people have in BTC as an investment, not actual liquidity or usefulness. Anyone with their head outside of their anus can clearly see that.
Cryptocurrency in general has a long way to go, bitcoin is just brand-name for now. I love profiting from it but the fees suck as do a lot of other things about it which is why the big players are smart to be where they are while consumers such as yourself who simply spend it and make a little bit here and there are the same as always. Just people buying things instead of investing and diversifying. Bitcoin doesn't care how much you believe in it or love it. It's not the be-all-end-all of anything.
