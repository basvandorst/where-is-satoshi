I guesstimated profit before tax to be around $10 million USD/year BEFORE the hack. Now the trouble is there are 120k less to trade on the site, plus the huge mistrust that whole debacle has created will keep people away from the platform.
So, as said, if they will only be able to keep generating $2-5 mio USD/year EBITA for the near future, this is barely enough to satisfy such a bond plan. If you force it on users that might be a different story, but doubt this will be possible even with the legal support of a company restructuring.

yeah, shame - another MtGox incoming. Or inside job.
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:59:55
Everything else means bancruptcy, which means years of waiting during which lawyers and judges eat up what's left, in addition to losing out on bitcoin movements.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:00:10
I'd say you are right in case of a 20k or maybe 40k hack. 120k, let's be realistic here, no way they recover from this, because nobody is paying $60 million for the damaged reputation and fleeing users of an exchange site.
The margin trading and lending on 'finex was good, but not that good.
@_date: 2016-08-04 09:20:24
That is indeed the case in most jurisdictions when default happens, so you can't favour friends or get remaining capital out of the firm. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:24:31
I can tell you, as an affected creditor in the MtGox bankrupcy, that I have yet to see a single cent after almost 2 and a half years of creditor meetings and bankrupcy proceedings. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:29:06
and who would buy these bonds?
edit: I think as high-risk bonds they should generate much higher interest. Say 5-15% per year.
At around $10 million EBITA now, and maybe 2-5 million if they relaunch, they probably could only barely afford $60 million @ 5% interest. If anything goes wrong, they don't grow the business again or are hacked again, everything goes down the drain again.

I don't want to let your condescending comment stand. So for the record, I don't think I'm far off ballparking their revenue (not profit!), and if you think I am wrong just post why. Don't just post shit.
@_date: 2016-08-09 09:16:31
at 150k BTC traded per week on average before the hack with maker and taker fees (around 2*0.2%), +around $30 million margin lending  APR average of which they take 15%, that's over 32k BTC/year for Bitfinex (31k of which from trading, 1k from margin lending).
So only with BTC and USD margin lending they made over $19 million dollars in the last 12 months. And it's safe to assume they made a good chunk on LTC and ETH trading as well.
So it's easy to see why people suspect there to be more company funds.

I'd say buy a small used miner (for &lt; $200) and use the rest of your cash to just buy bitcoin. You will get your feet wet mining, it's a far smaller burden on your companies electricity and you still enjoy having coins even if mining does not work out for you in the end.
@_date: 2015-12-12 21:43:10
Then it goes to 5k, 6k, 7k (then you'll rebuy out of spite), and only then it crashes back to 1k.

I still don't get why those devices would not use my "bitcoin appliance funds" for that. Those funds could be automatically replenished from my main wallet at exactly the amounts needed, the devices would be cheaper without mining hardware complexity, they would last longer on battery etc. All these disadvantages are hard to argue about it think.. 
@_date: 2015-12-12 13:09:55
You got that wrong, you have to buy if the price drops to $200, not sell.

The swings in price or volatility can have other reasons such as liquidity of the market, news, rumors, expectations of the coming halving, hoarding, traders trying to corner the market, short/long squeezes gone wrong, etc.
The demand and supply part certainly plays a big role in all that, but you just cannot equate them.
@_date: 2015-12-18 12:03:02
which really != demand has exceeded supply
@_date: 2015-12-18 22:08:37
I guess, my point is that the price movement only reflects the fraction of traders currently active. For me saying "demand has exceeded supply" means recurring and sustained need on the global level.

The frustration is understandable, to blame it on the Editor of Coin Fire, Mike Johnson, is just idiocy. The coins are gone and it's entirely cryptsy's fault.

I guess my "eat shit and die" answer doesn't cut it anymore..
@_date: 2016-01-16 22:36:29
lets say he can muster up enough money to buy 100 bitcoin ($38,4k), then sell bitcoins at 3x leverage at bitfinex. He can sell about 300 coins, and keeps the 38,4k in USD. Bitcoin goes to 0, he takes home 38,4k + 114k -fees, so possibly 150k take-home money. Then the IRS comes along and takes away a third of his gains, which leaves about 115k USD, a profit of ~$76k.
I wouldn't try to retire with that kind of money though..  
@_date: 2017-02-21 19:26:04
While I think there is truth to your point I also think new money is flowing in faster than old adopters cash out, hence the price moving up.

Right now, if everyone needed to at least make one transaction per month to send funds to a lightning channel, you top out at around 25 million users best case - if nobody closes a channel ever. Say 50% realistically close and reopen channels more than once to settle, it'l be 5-10 million users maybe.
@_date: 2017-01-30 09:52:14
They lost hashpower that could have been used for mining valid blocks. There is a chance that it reduced their average mined block reward.
edited: they didn't necessarily reduce it this time as it is a game of chance as well, but the more often it happens the bigger the confidence interval that it did. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 12:36:48
Maybe because you want redundancy for your backed up files? Maybe even on different harddrives/storage media?
@_date: 2017-01-30 12:17:05
If really 60% of hashing power is SPV mining, that doesn't verify the blocks - then more than every second invalid block would create a sustainable fork!

Yeah, I just purchased a steam key for $5 and paid $0.25 transaction fees. Though my wallet told me that was the highest proposed fee to be included in the next block, it took two blocks to have it included. 
So paying 5% on a $5 purchase and having to wait for confirmation is far from ideal. On the plus side no one could have prevented me from giving them my money.

@_date: 2016-02-23 22:09:44
Sorry, my reply wasn't supposed to sound angry in any way.
Scalability means the ability to accomodate a higher throughput of transactions. It does not imply low costs - Deploying a website on Amazon's cloud computing infrastructure might be very scalable, but it's not cheap either. 
Scalability is something that might or might not be important in a future where the currency has many more users. It does not affect the present much - Peercoin might scale much better than bitcoin, yet you do not feel any difference transacting with it, because it does not matter.
So my theory is that crypto users will chose the mix of security, convenience, cost, etc. that matters to the now, and not at some undefined time in the future. Bitcoin might scale better than alternatives in the future, but if it does not have the more compelling reasons to use now, its competitors will catch up.
@_date: 2016-02-23 15:04:19
Bitcoin still has to compete with other cryptocurrencies - and bitcoin price surely reflects adoption and usage. If we make bitcoin substantially more expensive to use than alternatives offering "good enough" security for our everyday purchases, price will go down as an indirect effect of fee pressure.

@_date: 2017-04-28 09:59:32
**How do you hide you (ran with customer coins and) are now insolvent?**
A short guide for up and coming crypto exchanges.
1) Change your cold wallet policy with traceable access to one where you can withdraw it all online
using two key secrets via API. Put them on the server so you can claim you were just stupid and some hacker did it.
2) Wait for the next bigger BTC price dip, and watch for people having to supplement their long margin positions with extra BTC - more profits for you. Take the coins and make sure it is enough to retire on. Leave enough in the exchange to play your con game going forward.
3) We have been hacked! Sooo sorry, do some PR to lessen the fallout
4) ~~Come up with a plan~~ Follow the plan you had all along (prepare the public for EFX tokens), 
    say all is well and that all customers will 
    be made whole again. "We are working incredibly hard, bear with us".
    Be credible, folksy and have some poor gullible support schmuck
    address all concerns coming up on the message boards and reddit.
    (those nasty nasty conspiry theorists.)
5) Confuse everyone with haircut, socialized loss percentages and just make everyone feel grateful that you didn't take all the funds. (Hey, running with USD is much harder anyways..)
Instead of "Make Amerika great again" you chant "Make everyone whole again", 
to the best of your abilities. Don't sweat that part.
5) But really you give a rat's ass about making everyone whole again, because what would be the point of taking the money in the first place?
6) You know it would take a hundred years to pay people back from operating profits alone so you must work on aggressively reducing the debt (and possible class action against your company construct)
7) Introduce EFX tokens, link the to BTCUSD value at the time of theft (you don't want your debt to go up, do you?), say you will redeem them in full, haha.
8) Now we work on reducing customer claims against you by
  a) make EFX debt tokens tradable, so people can sell at loss. After all it's their choice if they want to sell, right?
  b) Announce you don't trade EFX yourself, then buy back a good share under cover to reduce your 
      debt significantly 
  c) After some time redeem some tokens to restore faith in EFX tokens
      (the crowd goes nuts)
  d) let them convert assets into shares of some equity construct
      (company valuation based on arbitrarily inflated numbers)
  e) Redeem all outstanding tokens ON PAPER. Be careful, because now you have a problem:
Redeeming on paper is all fine and dandy as long as no one knows you didn't really give back the money you owe. How would people know? By trying to withdraw their money of course. Which brings us to
 e) Freeze USD withdrawals (blame it on the banks surely), so nobody can prove you have no USD left.
 f) Use your side project of non enforceable Tether debt tokens to procure some USD and shift some of the missing money to Tether clients (they won't suspect anything will they?) and appease the loudest critics. You can pat your back now.
 g) People will want to quit your exchange and buy BTC for inflated prices. 
Use this BTC price differential to your advantage and arbitrage yourself while your users can't
with the rest of the meagre fiat reserves you still hold! Clean out the house!
h) All the while you post record earnings and keep the facade of a healthy exchange up to lure in new capital and traders so you can make some fees (well knowing that your whole operation can blow up in their faces any time)
i) Claim you are solvent and will have an audit and thorough proof of reserves soonish (you won't.)
8) Tough luck, your plan didn't work out. You still have 30+ million USD of obligations you cannot meet. You expect that even though BTC price on your exchange is now $300 over all other exchanges, the outflow of coins will deplete your last hot wallet in about a week. You get kinda depressed.
9) On the bright side, the 127k BTC you aptly took is now over 150 million USD. You say, fuck it and disappear. Can only be a couple years until BTC transaction privacy has improved enough to start spending it, so you think. 
10) The exchange blows up. Employees realize they are no longer in a position of keeping the exchange up. After all what do you trade on it with nothing left? Some poor fella posts a moratorium to the company blog and hands over control to authorities. 
11) Reddit and message board clowns pop up like mushrooms after rain and post a thousand times "We told you so, SFYL", has a field day and the responsible members of the community post suicide prevention links, stickied maybe.
12) BTC price dips hard (why the fuck do you sell even when so many people need to rebuy parts of their holdings?!) and rebounds stronger than ever shortly afterwards. Many people who lost money are disgusted and cannot bring themselves to buy back in - they don't know yet that they will be the ones responsible for the next run up far beyond the last ATH.
13) Realsolid comes out of nowhere and buys the code of the former exchange website for 5k BTC he acquired from his own (successful and honorable) exchange crowdsale, rebrands it as slickfexNow.com and reopens business. The crowd goes insane, and slickfexNow.com becomes exchange number 1 in a couple of months.
The end.

The thing they don't realize: if you buy now, around only $10 million buy you more than 1/1000th of all bitcoins. Thats is. Don't buy more, just tuck it away somewhere and don't think about it anymore. If it becomes big, wonderful, if not, at least you had a great hedge.
I don't get why you would want to wait until it stabilizes and all, if by then you will have to spend ten times as much for 1/10th the coins..
@_date: 2016-02-20 20:55:39
ah sorry then.
@_date: 2016-02-20 22:43:21
I really thought you were the highest up ;)
@_date: 2016-02-18 12:18:32
But it could also be the first hump my friend. Up to $50 like litecoin did last year.
@_date: 2017-04-04 20:35:19
I guess if humankinds only goal was to procreate we might be able to do it..
@_date: 2017-04-19 08:07:32
You are deluded.
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:57:32
But if global speculative frenzy sets in that limit could be 10x higher.
So $150 million seems like a sane upper limit per coin.

It used to be 'let the miners decide what machines they can afford given subsidy and fees'. Now it's 'let there be a fee market so the miners can put some food on their tables' all day long.
@_date: 2017-04-28 19:50:56
At least you don't own mxnow fees right, right?
Edit: yeah, I felt compelled to close the circle in  as BTC drama just feels to repeat over and oever and over. Just with different names and fresh sucker capital each time..
@_date: 2017-04-28 16:40:49
Maybe because they try to go for it all: The coins, no debts and a money making exchange..
@_date: 2017-04-28 19:50:12
It could probably be some series, a la breaking bad on the blockchain..
I actually would watch that shit.
@_date: 2016-02-20 20:55:58
@_date: 2016-09-20 21:19:18
Yeah, that's much better. Speaks for itself now.
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:47:20
Better get the fee market up and running or we can't pay all those miners..
@_date: 2016-09-20 13:02:30
Stupid comparison - you would need to also show at least Bitstamp and BTC-e volumes, otherwise you couldn't know if this was due to general low activity or the hack.
@_date: 2016-09-20 18:36:50
Send 0.0001 btc there, wipe device clean and recover with seed. If unrecoverable, seed is bad, otherwise congrats.

Did you live through the recent bear market of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:20:41
He really should warn them to get out of the way or get steamrolled!
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:55:03
do you think that is the case here?
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:53:37
invest a swell?

WHAT WOULD SATOSHI NAKAMOTO DO?
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:34:05
You'd be comfortable with $499k ?
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:58:05
Put in 100% then it'll stay 100. Easiest thing in the world.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:50:34
Sell 20%. So you made some profit and are still in the game. Repeat until you are not panicking anymore..
@_date: 2017-10-19 10:14:41
Buy 1 bitcoin and you make the amount equivalent to what it goes up or down. It goes up $200, you make $200, it goes down $150 you lose $150.
Now if you only buy $50 worth of 1 bitcoin, so only 0.0088 of a bitcoin (at $5670 per bitcoin) you only make 0.0088 times the amount bitcoin goes up or down. It goes up $200, you only make $1.76. It goes down $150, you only lose $1.32. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:32:43
Like magic, right?

It is NOT easy to dis/prove a number is not prime/prime when we go to very large numbers (and large factors).

@_date: 2017-10-29 21:40:38
Why would it reduce the price to $25000,- if it's a positive thing for bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:45:25
Hint: it's not sustainable. At some point it will crash a wee lil' bit and enter a bear market for some time again.
@_date: 2018-07-26 14:22:16
But you will get paid in LN as well. Convert fiat to LN.. etc. It will be uneconomical to do almost any transaction on mainnet
@_date: 2018-07-26 18:06:52
Just be a bit forward thinking. Every major exchange will soon offer payout to your lightning address. And when the alternative - payout to bitcoin address will cost substantially more, LN will become the main way of transferring small to medium amounts of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-09 21:39:22
I recommend just buying eg. $50 worth of bitcoin, so you can get a feel for it. Spend a third, secure a third and carry the last third with your mobile phone.
You might even want to gamble a fraction, or try and daytrade a part on an exchange or even buy some altcoins. 
When you feel comfortable, you should reevaluate your options, especially if it would make more sense to gradually convert your savings into bitcoin.

Selling off Wright shares accelerates for me.
@_date: 2016-05-02 12:35:25
True indeed, albeit a bit less tragic.
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:08:49
It guess it will take more time on litecoin, smaller coin, less dev power. But yeah, it'll still be a rush to be first.
@_date: 2017-05-10 13:57:23
I bet once sewit is sure to activate, a heap of players will contend fiercely to provide the the dominant lightning wallet/solution. Very usable things will pop up in weeks rather than months.
@_date: 2016-05-02 12:23:10
My god, this stinks of scam so much. They'll even find a bunch of idiots giving them money .. because, you know, it's all locked up in a trust fund and "Satoshi" doesn't have access to the funds anymore. LMAO. As if the inventor of bitcoin would give away all his private keys to a third party for safekeeping.
This is so blatantly idiotic that I wonder for the sanity of anyone even giving that BS the tiniest amount of doubt.
@_date: 2016-05-04 15:43:20
This would be all over the news anyway..
@_date: 2016-05-02 12:25:47
howso? 
Only if he wasn't hacked and he really belives conman Wright.
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:14:28
Explain like you are 5?
@_date: 2017-05-10 20:43:11
Possibly - the one that already are LN devs..
@_date: 2016-05-02 12:18:16
Please spare us the BS.
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:06:45
Same thing in reverse happening on Poloniex, daily margin lending rates rocketed to 4%+, because Poloniex credits bitcoin cash to BTC borrowers..
As you can only borrow BTC by shorting another coin, expect a small surge of shorted alts after bitcoin cash has been credited by the exchanges..

He was wise with his coins, spent only about 1/4th of his coins to buy a cheap appartment in the worse parts of Oslo and held on to the rest. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 21:11:25
So how the hell do Venezuelans cope with their fiat money when it's basically a game of hot potato? What do you do when you get handed cash? Spend or invest it as soon as possible or how do ordinary people go about it? 
I would imagine people must grow desperate to get their hands on other payment forms that don't depreciate that fast?
