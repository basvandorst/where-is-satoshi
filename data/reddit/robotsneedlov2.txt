Did you miss "off-ledger transactions"? 
Bitcoin is suppose to be a public ledger where transactions are verified by all. You put a significant portion of it off-ledger then it's no longer bitcoin.

Oh right decentralise power of others while centralising power to themselves right?
Keep up the FUD.
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:10:14
Right instead you trust bitstream and a bunch of bankers who hijacked the development team to make transactions offledger. Well done.

Satoshi went silent in 2010. I see a message by Mike Hearn discussing some anti-DoS HFT in 2013.

As oppose to the OP who's probably paid by Bitstream to FUD right?

Great example of not answering anything and directly going to personal attacks.
What does Jihan have to do with anything? I want bitcoin to not contain any lightning off-ledger bullshit. I don't trust Bitstream and their lightning network. I don't trust a bunch of core programmers putting functions into my bitcoin that's not part of Satoshi's plan. It's that simple.

Really, please point to where in Satoshi's white paper where it says transactions should be handled in some centralized off-chain network.
The whole point of bitcoin is that it is a transparent publicly verifiable ledger where all transactions on the bitchain can be verified by everybody else. 
Segwit's lightning network is a paradigm shift towards centralization that changes everything in how bitcoin is tranacted.
Bitcoin cash is the last attempt to preserve the Bitcoin blockchain before SegWit transactions are written into it. If you are against centralization you should not be supporting segwit.

Hundreds of developers? More like dozens. With authority all concentrated at the top. If you say Bitstream Core is so accountable, then why have so many developers (including former head dev Gavin Andresen) have been pushed out, with accounts of toxic work environments and arbitrary vetos on code they disagree with?
Reverse what you're saying about miners and replace it with core developers it'll be true. The fact is there is currently no checks and balances against the current Bitstream Core, they do whatever they want. If they want to remove the 21m cap, they can do so. If they want to change the very face of bitcoin, by slapping on an off-ledger network they can do so (and they did). And it costs them NOTHING, in fact they get paid from fiat banks to do just that.
Where as for the miners, if they don't like whatever Core is coming up with, their only option is to fork. But they need to risk millions of dollars already spent on mining equipment to do so. 
That's not choice, that's extortion.

OP is FUD-ing hardcore. Bitcoin cash is Bitcoin without segwit as per Satoshi original plan. 
Some people don't buy into that lightning nonsense to take transactions off the chain. Bitcoin is suppose to be public ledger. What kind of public ledger would it be, if someone can arbitrarily siphon off funds into some darkpool that the Bitstream devs have monopoly control over? It goes against all the original principles of bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:27:48
Ok then imagine everyone's on the lightning network (which BScore will try to force by rejecting all non-Segwit nodes). 
Then the future of bitcoin will become that no one will sees what anyone else's doing. It will no longer be a transparent public ledger. It'll just be another fiat bank transfer system with large entities netting at the end of each day. 
And of course that's not mentioning any trust issues associated with the channel and network operators and all that power been centralized with them.

Bitcoin Cash is created by developers who do not like the SegWit2X compromise and want to be faithful to the original Satoshi plan.
They don't want off-ledger transaction (aka lightning) as it defeats the purpose of public ledgers. They don't want to be subjected to whims of the Bitsteam Core. Think of them as more anti-SegWit than Jihan (who actually supports SegWit2X) that these Bitstream shrills are so obsessed about.
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:01:19
He's on shrilling on overtime. Bitstream is probably paying him $$$ everytime he says Jihan.

Asicboost gives an advantage over other asic computers so what?
Asic computers also give an advantage over desktop computers. 
How come I don't get to ban all asic computers so my gpu rig can mine too?
They found a way to mine more efficiently and spend less power, this is NOT wrong.
They are not breaking the Bitcoin protocol standards.
They are producing valid blocks.
In fact I see this as evidence that Bitstream core's power is out of control. They can now arbitrarily change the rules whenever it suits them.
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:25:22
Lol the only one who keeps yapping about Jihan is you bitstream shrills.
He's not even related to Bitcoin cash and you keep bringing him up.
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:05:24
Yes unfortunately I don't go on reddit 24/7 like your Bitstream crew to upvote each other.
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:01:36
Not really the "hate" is artificially generated by paid Bitstream shrills who inhabit reddit 24/7 like DaggerHashimoto and Terminal-Psychosis. 
They think all anti-core people are Jihan. All of China is Jihan. Anything they don't like is Jihan. (Even though Jihan actually supports their shitty Segwit.)

Then you'll have to point me where it describes this fantasy lightning network on the white paper.
Here's what Satoshi actually said:
"If the network becomes very large... most users should start running client-only software and only the specialist server farms keep running full network nodes, kind of like how the usenet network has consolidated."
