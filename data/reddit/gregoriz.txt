But wouldn't it mean that market would be more and more congested and frozen ? In this case bitcoin value could actually drop as people would lost interest/faith in the currency.

There is a reason why banks tell people not to share their credit card code.
I hope for you she is as incredible as you describe, but you should always consider that she can get emotional for stuff you wouldn't  be able to predict. This could  result in a huge disappointment.

I forgot about lost wallet but hell yeah that's actually even more true at the moment. I think there is a shit load of BTC which has been lost. First owners are the one who were able to get a lot of BTC. There are many stories about people loosing their private key after loosing interest in the money. 
It would be awesome to know how many "available" BTC are remaining.

Problem is not less mining. The problem is sharp drop of hash power leading to slower transactions which would have bad effect on liquidity of the market. Which is a problem we would worsen ^^

I feel you bro!
I wanted to put a sell  order for 1kXRP at 0.36/unit€ when they were at 0.33.
It took me like 10minutes to get my order registered. As the moment it was 0.355 and I was like "it's rising too fast, gonna cancel my order".
Aaaaaaaand 4minutes of error, order processed and XRP at 0.4€.
Fuck them.
