Why don't you just rig Bitcoin up with dynamite and blow it up?
UASF is the most idiotic, dangerous, and hypocritical idea in recent history for Bitcoin. Nodes don't determine consensus, the longest proof-of-work chain determines consensus. It's trivial to spin up 1000's of bitcoin nodes on AWS, you can even finance it personally if you make a relatively decent income.
UASF should be censored as an altcoin. It's not Bitcoin, and it's @ dangerous.

Raise the blocksize limit.


This is meaningless jargon. If you don't see how bi-directional payment flows are required for LN to work broadly, you don't understand how people actually use Bitcoin today.


So then it follows that we shouldn't choke bitcoin to death with a 1MB limit in favor for a L2 network that doesn't exist, so we have no idea if it will be used or be safe.

Because I think it's particularly telling how much energy was put into this "paid with bitcoin" propaganda, when the company's savings itself is held in fiat.
It shows a profound lack of belief in the future of the cryptocurrency blockstream invests so much of that same savings to control.
It's a giant conflict of interest. You should divest yourself and work on an honest project that isn't effectively a cancer on the original cryptocurrency.

Because it doesn't work right now in the real world for end users and businesses, that's why.
Lightning is theoretically cool (note theoretically, doesn't exist in a form where I can easily use it, so doesn't exist) if you want to open an account with an exchange to trade more frequently without Mt. Gox risks, but it's not a good way to send small transactions to other individuals. If you want to make small payments to say, Bitpay, all the money flows one way, from you to Bitpay. That simply doesn't work, unless there is a reason for Bitpay to send Bitcoin back to you.
Lightning is useful for specific needs (exchange accounts) but is square peg round hole for general P2P payments.

And those wallets, exchanges, and payment processors become trusted 3rd parties in the process. 
That's not any worse for exchanges, who were already collecting and verifying your identity using unsafe technology, putting your security and the fungibility of your Bitcoin at risk. 
It's NOT ok for wallets and payment processors. That is, if you are actually a bitcoiner and not trying to turn bitcoin into a bank settlement system / bad copy of Ripple.

What are you talking about? It absolutely changes the main value proposition. Do you even know how LN works? Read the code on github. The routing is not decentralized and the entire concept only works if there are roughly symmetrical currency flows between two parties, not one way. Most payment scenarios are one way, meaning LN doesn't work well for them.
Enough with the BS already.

Hardware wallets are useful for the "digital gold" version of Bitcoin where it is is unusable, expensive, but magically keeps going up in value. 
This hoax which Slush is now a part of is why the alt coin market is aggressively approaching the value of bitcoin, and threatens to surpass it any day now.
I want bitcoin to go back to what it was in the whitepaper, p2p electronic cash. That's what was exciting about it and got everyone interested in it in the first place.
Edit: Trezor has altcoin support, by the way. I'm sure that's completely unrelated. /s

You need to realize that UASF is a "sybil attack" and segwit is a trojan horse. 
I guess if your heros succeed in ruining Bitcoin and turn it into a regulated bank settlement system we can always go use a cryptographically anonymous cryptocurrency instead. How does that sound?
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:16:48


Is that a serious question? People use Bitcoin because it's peer to peer electronic cash without middlemen to trust. That's what made it so valuable. What you are proposing is a completely different payment network that requires trusted and specialized 3rd parties to function.
There is a strong demand to clear out the transaction backlog without radically altering the properties of Bitcoin, i.e. increasing the max_block_size.

They don't, not in the real-world. Also, the post above 'skips' the two biggest concerns: 1) the routing isn't decentralized (read code on github) and will result in larger hubs running more cost effectively and 2) "Decentralized" LN only works if currency flows are more or less bidirectional between two parties, and not one-way. Well, p2p payments are rarely two-way, you pay a merchant or someone, and it's' rare they pay you back. LN is only good for safer exchange transactions. We have a bunch of technicial people with mild to moderate asberger's syndrome trying to force LN on us as a solution to a problem we don't have and it doesn't solve.

Ok. I certainly hope you are right.


Regardless of whether you believe in Greg Maxwell and Adam Back's sincerity (I do not trust either of them one iota), the defensibly of the DPL + pledge has more holes in it than a block of swiss cheese. This has been discussed ad nauseum elsewhere. A simple written notice and 180 days notice is all that is required to withdraw from the DPL. That could be done with the current management, or with new management voted in by the BOD. It could also be done after, or as a precondition for, an acquisition. 
The terms of the DPL preclude any established company from joining, so the risk that blockstream would ever have to extend the DPL license after withdrawing from the DPL is effectively 0.

You **do not** know that. At all.
The hash rate of Bitcoin is tied to the value of bitcoin trading in other currencies on the open market.
The transaction throughput of bitcoin is not as closely tied to the value of bitcoin or the hash rate.
This argument that transaction throughput is somehow 1:1 correlated to hash rate is the basis for the argument you are making. That argument is **patently false**. 
The transaction throughput of bitcoin is being artificially limited right now, which is causing artificially high fees and wait times for settlement. This 'policy' by the core developers and arguably the private companies heavily subsidizing that team and media around it makes bitcoin artificially inefficient.
All honest empirical analysis of this subject shows that proof of work is required as the underpinning of any decentralized form of electronic cash. No implemented form of proof of stake has proven to be resilient from centralized control. All forms of proof of stake are vulnerable to exploits related to forks in the protocol. 
Bitcoin is still one of, if not the most efficient form of p2p electronic cash, if the artificial limits on its throughput were to be allowed to scale responsibly.
Do I think we need to remove all limits? No. But I do think 8000000 is a perfect new setting with transaction size limitations in order to give it room to grow.
Leaving the limit at 1000000 is idiotic, and betting bitcoin's future on "additional layers" that have zero users today and no end user demand is pure lunacy. Only someone who has never built a business or released a product that is popular would see "additional layers" as the next step in bitcoin's evolution.
Working on "additional layers" before raising the 1000000 cap is  backwards. If you can't see that, you are missing the point of bitcoin.

I'm also financially conflicted as I hold more than a few bitcoins and feel that increasing the max_block_size setting is 10x more urgent than enabling theoretical payment channel schemes that are heavily backed by private companies taking large checks from banks and insurance giants. 
So we have similar conflicts, but apparently very different understandings of what is immediately important for Bitcoin's health.
That's fine, I think we'll have to agree to disagree.

Even though I agree that Bitcoin is undervalued right now relative to other cryptocurrencies, what's with "the great Andreas Antonopolous"? That's like saying "the great Stephen Colbert" (the republican one) when having a serious conversation about foreign policy. He's a paid spokesperson who has changed his colors more than a chameleon over the last few years. Otherwise, yes, go Bitcoin.

What this "non-mining user" is describing is called a sybil attack. No one wants BIP148. We want on-chain scaling. Go to a local Bitcoin meetup and talk to people. Ask them what they want and see for yourself. You can't astroturf as easily in person.

@_date: 2017-06-02 13:11:58


There's a big, gaping hole in your logic. 
The reason bitcoin has allowed you to gain purchasing power is because it is a *different* medium of exchange.
That means, there's absolutely no friction if you want to send a payment to anyone you want. No one can control your money. That's why Bitcoin gained so much value.
If you are in bitcoin to gain purchasing power, but don't appreciate the fact that it is (or was) a unique medium of exchange, i.e. peer to peer electronic cash, then you are missing the point. Bitcoin's properties as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a payment network (because who wants electronic p2p cash if you can only pay yourself?) are what gives it more and more purchasing power relative to other currencies.
Bitcoin went from $0 to $1,200 because it was a way for any two people to send almost any amount of value directly between them, with no 3rd person in the middle. 
Bitcoin again recently went from $1,200 all the way up to $2,800 because, at least for a brief moment, there was the potential for a scaling compromise out of NY.
I don't know any "small blockers" in real life, because everyone I meet in person who is excited about Bitcoin understands the above. 
Yet whenever I come to certain forums, it's like there's an entirely different world of people that don't exist at local Bitcoin meetups, or any other in person events.
I wonder why that is?

Asicboost wasn't even discovered by Jihan, it was patented by SDL. Jihan patented the same approach in China, where patent law is a big joke. There is literally nothing stopping anyone from fabricating chips that run Asicboost, and there isn't any reason to believe Jihan was running it either. 
But here you are again smearing Jihan over a literal nonissue. Asicboost is fake news used to smear Jihan for opposing SegWit and for pushing for a blocksize increase. 
Jihan is a hero for bitcoin. The more of this garbage he has to tolerate from shills like you, the more we're going to trust him.
