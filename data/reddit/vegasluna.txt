the bitcoin losing dominance is such a bullshiat fud narrative when we all know the volume of shiatcoins that have been and are still being created. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:17:31
i disagree. anyone can make a shiatcoin and pump it to take more marketcap . a lot of coins, like XRP for instance, is not being used at all by anyone. XRP is not a even a genuine crypto-currency .
i believe bitcoin is very appealing. once segwit is up the scaling issue will be improved. i do agree with bigblockers that an on-chain scaling solution would be good to implement if not just for redundancy . i am redundant in everything . 
people who do not find bitcoin appealing probably do not own a significant amount at this time. they are scrambling to find the next bitcoin because they think they have missed the boat ..

bud... bitcoin been talking about what its going to do for years.. until it is implemented, it still hasn't been implemented.. get it ?? until u finally do something, u still haven't done something.. except talk about what u gonna do.

as if bitcoin hasn't already had years to plan. segwit talk is nothing but talk. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:33:53
it the bitcoin classic forks, then there will be two bitcoin classics... polo will have bitcoin classic vanilla and bitcoin classic chocolate.

i think the way they were cutting him off really shows that they are FAKE NEWS.
@_date: 2017-01-26 23:09:48
because.. its the same thing for years.. bitcoin talks about how its going to fix itself and it NEVER does.. it has literally been years.. everyone pretends segwit is something, when reality is it is nothing but talk. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 14:24:55


SegWit...Smegwit... we been hearing about this for years.. IMPLEMENT IT.. until you do, you still haven't.. only thing u do is TALK about what your going to do.. while you don't do anything. your all talk yo...

chinese miners aint worth it 
@_date: 2017-01-26 14:16:26
i can't remember the details, but i do recall hearing discussions about eths inflation being reduced with the implementation of something in near future  (i can't remember details)
@_date: 2017-01-10 19:55:53
well, they will be saying how its volatility just fell $100 . how do we invest in that ?? how do we track how much thing is going to be worth next year ?? who is investing in bitcoin ?? 
good job getting etherium mentioned in there!

well i do know that Bitcoin Core version v0.12.0 (64-bit) works with armory 0.93.3

part you conveniently left out: that is only if you try to move ETHC without splitting it first. If a user completely ignores ETHC, then this will not affect them. You guys are spreading FUD.

i believe this is a major sign that the usa is on the verge of complete collapse. this is a sign of weakness . they are desperate. they have resorted to theft .
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:50:05
the abusive high taxes are not enough anymore, they must resort to outright theft from their citizens. yeah thats going to work. total flouride coated brain morons.
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:20:43
and then the collapse happens. if you lose something, u will shrink and never be as big as once were.
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:18:26
they don't want to implement blockchain voting either, because they are corruption .
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:23:24
and they will take a risk that will backfire causing them more problems than they started with .
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:41:06
because they are bankrupt. and they do not have the intelligence to build anything. they only have the intel to steal from all of us and break things. it can be frustrating dealing w low intelligence and the handicapped.
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:26:16
well, if your brain "cannot recall" things, well what can do ?? maybe they will waterboard you, and turn you into a zombie.
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:59:34
during obamaturds administration, they had absolutely no victories on any front. last eight years has been nothing other than failures and catastrophes . 
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:10:34


this is a scheme to steal from us citizens. i regularly transport more than $10,000 in cash .... JUST TO PAY MY TAXES !!!!! how many silver and gold tards transport that much to their pm dealers to buy or sale ?? 
my opinion is: its none of their dam business ... period.
