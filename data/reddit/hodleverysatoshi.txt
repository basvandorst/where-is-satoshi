I really appreciate this thread. Along with others reccomendations I have learned some interesting things today! Congratulations too you for holding this long. You deserve every penny for the stress (which I probably can't relate too). I do have a few questions if I can pick your brain.
1. You have mentioned there are fewer BTC millionaires than people think. Do you believe that people who are accumulating now or in the past will be come millionaires? This is assuming they are as patient as you and say hodl (2k-10k $) worth of bitcoin at today's prices? 
2. If there is a new wave of bitcoin millionaires as I asked in question 1, what would you say to everyone about handling stress, handeling being a rich young person, and any other advice you would say to everyone about how to keep themselves togeather.
3. Looking back at everything has HODLing helped your life? What I mean is would you enjoy life better if you never HODLed? This would mean a normal working life.
Once again congratulations and go live out your dreams!

Will this actually work if each square is cut into the exact same size?

If you get a ledger just buy it straight from the manufacturer. No ebay, Amazon, neighbor, or random website.

Do they take dogecoin?

Not your keys not your bitcoin.

As someone who supports Ron Paul and loves the confederate flag I thank you for showing me this highlight of Mr. Paul's career.

Don't be lazy. Write it down and place it in a fire proof safe. You can also buy a kit where you stamp the words onto a steel sheet.
