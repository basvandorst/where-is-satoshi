Dealing with a BTM owner and a fellow crypto user. All three of us are using Mycelium. No luck .

Been having issues with multiple devices using btc and now I'm having to wait for support at a btm cause mycelium btc wallet had derailed the fluidity once i trusted. When i get home to a computer I'll write up a proper ticket for this ongoing issue.

You can buy food directly with bitcoin at many fine establishments. I usually eat at many restaurants on the Fremont St Las Vegas NV that take it directly.

I'll write up a proper bug finder review whatever. Just gave a sour taste to semi long time bitcoin users.

Look what happened to the E gold guy. Maybe that's why. Feds went after dude. Like dude in Australia claiming creater or original coder and law enforcement crashed his house faster than Bin Laden's.

I was wondering when someone was going to bring that issue up and a few others.
The tx fees added to the x2 different fees customers are going to have to go through before finally receiving their BTC is insane and going to actually work against crypto adoption.
The fact that you don't really need KYC/AML to turn your receipt for fiat cash, though they have always with incentives like keeping up with receipt logs for tax reasons and other things.
But then having to register to a whole new service, be convinced to download their wallet or another independent if choose to do so, then have a more invasive KYC/AML protocol than the prior one already have had to obtain.
This all sounds like it's going to push a lot of users away from Bitcoin with it's highway robber type fees from coin to crypto.

I do legal crypto to marijuana transactions every day.

So true about two years ago. I rarely trade to fiat now and it's a billion times easier to tune friends when businesses not only take them. Baltimore, Denver, Vegas, Frisco. Super bitcoin friendly.

Check OB2 or if you don't feel like messing with their shotty program. Etsy. Still has a few vendors that will work OTC for crypto there, obviously crypto enthusiast like us.

So has anyone actually documented trying one of these?
Is it real?
The fee's shoot the whole thing in the foot, with lots of noobs shying away soon as they see the highway robbery of fees it is to purchase things like this.
Consequently, I found a new way to cash out, same highway robbery model.
Buy gift cards, sell them for cash at locations that buy the rest of your gift card balance, lots of them charging you dam near 50%.
e.g., tried to cash out a $30 AMC card, they offered $14.65 USD cash.
Now if I had stolen the coin to buy the card to then cash out with as little to no KYC/AML possible, that would have been choice.
I made my coins legally, so I am not trying to liquidate them for less than half of their worth, same idea applies to USD to BTC. 
Why loose dam near 40% of you USD fiat trying to purchase BTC, specially when these days price is still falling horribly down.
e.g., had someone go get me $800 BTC, they had to pay near $1200 at a BTM to send it to me and paid another $20 fee to send it from their wallet to mine.
See how all of this is basically a big shake down ?

Dam. Wish i had my original Y-Bitcoin magazines.

You kind of can, though you will hate BTC afterwards.
Buy gift cards, ironically same place that sells the coins has franchise and/or markets that are possible to participate in when purchasing gift cards with those brand new shinny satoshi's.
I have observed this at most BTM locations, where if you notice, the surrounding are basically the store of every gift card I can purchase with the BTC.
Though, after buying a gift card at 15% incentive, and then applying the gift card to an app belonging to the store you are going to spend said gift card for another 10% off. So you will notice you just went though a whole lot of process as an average user that seems crazy, for an individual trying to cash out to live on the coins because they were paid in coin seems best option.
You can totally live on BTC in lots of places without ever having to touch an actual bank, just some simple shit like Pay Pal (and we know it's not that hard to bypass their KYC/AML).
I like adoption, though I don't see any benefit yet.

You but a gift card and then sale that at gift card buyers website that will pay you via pay pal or any other of pay pals money transmitting companies.

Lol, they already have.

I've been using them since day one. Best bitcoin wallet there is next to original bitcoinwallet on play, electrum desk top and samurai On play. Apple products ruin the bitcoin experience.

That's what's gm happening right now.
