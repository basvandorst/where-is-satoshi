But satoshi aka Nick Szabo, was an early contributor to the ethereum white paper.  
Ethereum is the fullest implementation of satoshis ideas on decentralisation. 
I own bitcoin too, but ethereum is just a better technology.  
Sorry faggots.

What do you mean "both of which are pro ethereum"? I already explained how none of his actions can be considered "pro ethereum".

ethereum can make threads?

"They've". The actions of one misguided lone ranger there's no "they've" anything.

What did the spam say?  And it linked to literally the cringiest post I've ever seen on r/ethereum.  If the spammer really wanted to big up ethereum they could have directed you to one of the many news articles that praise ethereum. 
Someone wanted to start a fight and cause trouble.  That is all.

Coinbase is a harmful company.  Their whole business model is built around converting btc to fiat

"it's a group"
Not really.  It's Nick Szabo. Anyone with a brain can see this.

What you mean, is you fork the coin in to two seperate coins then see if anyone buys bitcoinxt. Surely if its a good enough coin it will be a speculative attack on "bitcoin original"

A clever idea

I agree you have to focus on the big picture.  Cryptocurrencies basically are computer viruses that spread through human society.

Koolaid; the post

The very person who wrote those words, Nick Szabo, is an early contributor to the ethereum white paper.  
You've got your head so far up your arse you fail to see the trees.

The spam was a false flag attack. The ethereum price is up for other reasons.
