I've been avoiding posting this thought, because I thought it would come across as crazy-moon talk, but in light of this article am going to post it anyway:
Someone last week commented that putting $ in any cryptocurrency at this point was "just gambling."
I disagree, but I decided to research the gambling industry a little bit to educate myself.  I found out it is *vastly* larger than I ever imagined.  People officially spend roughly ~$500 Billion on gambling worldwide, EVERY YEAR, and that's just the published number.  It's estimated that the true number is close to twice that when you factor in untracked sports betting, etc. and we're not even getting into types of gambling that aren't officially considered gambling (day-trading OTC stocks, etc.)
My point is this:
Even if you accept the premise (I don't) that investing $ in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies is "gambling" right now,  _Bitcoin's total market capitalization is just 3% of what people blow on *actual* gambling every year._  Furthermore, the money people waste on actual gambling is pulled out of that system almost immediately for expenses, dividends to casino shareholders, etc. whereas in crypto, I believe a substantial majority stays in the system creating a feedback loop.
TLDR:  even if investing in bitcoin right now were "just gambling" I believe it would have a very long way to go yet.

If you're interested in investing in bitcoin, you should definitely start ASAP (a friend of mine has been planning to get started "as soon as she has time" and she's now kicking herself for missing out on the recent run)  however basic rules of financial prudence still apply:
1) Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to begin adding bitcoin to your portfolio without trying to time the market (coinbase and others can be setup to do this for you automatically)
2)  Diversify appropriate to your age and goals (if you're younger, you can take more risk and put a larger percentage of your net worth in a single asset class like Bitcoin, despite its volatility.)  Most of us here believe it will appreciate massively relative to fiat currency over the long term, but anything could happen in the short term, so you need to be prepared to hold it for a while.
YMMV, IANAL, only you can decide how you should handle your money, etc. etc.  Good luck! :)

The current year is 4715 according to the traditional Chinese calendar.  Maybe we can use that instead! :)

This, in a nutshell, is why I got involved with bitcoin in the first place and why I believe in the idea so much.
It's also what worried me about the recent forking debate, though I have to confess I'm not sure I ever understood that entirely (I am reasonably smart and technically inclined, but far from a crypto expert.)
The cryptocurrency world is so dynamic right now, that as an adult who works 80+ hours per week and also has a family to attend to, I've found it difficult to stay on top of the news.
My layperson's understanding of the recent fork tumult was that it centered at least in part on the fact that control of the currency lies with miners, and that bitcoin mining power had become concentrated over time with a small number of actors in China.
Could someone point me towards the best, reputable ELI5 overview of that situation and where it stands today? 
Thank you!!

Hasn't this been argued to death already?  Dollar bills have no intrinsic value - they're a store of wealth because we as a society have agreed that they have value.  Gold has minimal intrinsic value - but it's been treated as a store of wealth for millenia because we as a society agreed it had value.
Similarly, we as a community have decided that Bitcoin *is* a store of value, and it has the value that we give it.

We are not going to take flack from a country that calls its official fiat currency "the loonie"   ;)

I'm sad I only have one upvote I can give this post, it deserves more :-)
Fuck Wells Fargo in particular.

Noob question:  can anyone tell me why it says "redditor for 4 days" next to my name above when my first post was 12 days ago?

Bitcoin + Engineered Negligible Senescence FTW :)
