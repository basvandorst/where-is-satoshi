localbitcoins, in europe: anycoindirect.
Binance, digifinex, tradeogre.
AVOID, don't use: crex24, livecoin - basically most russian exchanges...the chinese are ool but get ready for a dosage of engRish...more like 'changlish'.

Truth be told over the years I've witnessed this on coinmarketcap (some similar website??): "bitcoin dominance 40%", today: "bitcoin dominance: 60+%" - yeah looks like the altcoins are loosing some ground yet I am not going to rule out say ethereum just yet...I am only guided by what I need and for now I don't mind plenty of the innovations, the issue of course being: if the world likes them, because without demand they fall and disappear.

yeah it's probably not cool to laugh at them :)....I remember the first time I saw the word "stratum" and all the code behind a simple mining command on linux 5 years ago it looked quite bizarre and today...the word 'strarum' still sounds bizarre to me lol.

True...but also on a different note I'm curious what the status quo will be like 10 years from now, while the average person will know more so will the competition evolve (eos, ether, tron...), the method to brute force too (distributed quantum computing one day??) and while the &lt;21th million address will get mined around 2140 it's hard to imagine it will last across centuries.

sorry, sure...I even contradicted myself by saying there are already all the 2 \^160 addresses that can get brute forced + to  elaborate: I know there will still be miners even after that date though with questionable motivation since no one will award them other than fees of course...maybe it will move to PoS by then who knows.

one billion paid for one transaction 0\_0 ..."yeah confirm that localbitcoins!".

I'd call it "private password" - then no one will ever give it to anyone. 
edit: better yet..."PPPP = personal private pin password".
