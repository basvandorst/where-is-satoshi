Thank you, mr trader!
Would you mind telling me since when does CBOE provide mini corn, min yen, etc futures?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:09:03
Well, they’ve warned everyone “Please invest responsibly”
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:06:27
and compare

who sold you electrum?
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:46:36
Are you sure? 
@_date: 2017-07-12 19:44:14
Not yet. Should I? I'm wondering what the real problem is.

I had absolutely the same dialogue with their support. Waiting $10k wire since end of May. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 11:10:42
They don't do the trace. They ask $25 for a simple MT103.

I would really love to hear something more specific than "We suggest you to wait for a while" once again.
@_date: 2017-07-14 11:08:28
I surely wouldn't. But I'm not sure yet who is responsible here.

They told me to wait as well while they will request info from the bank about my withdrawal. But in my case it is definitely not the wrong account number.

Could you please explain how your support team overload makes an impact on wires marked as completed? 
Waiting a month for a wire or 2-3 weeks for a SWIFT message (which my bank provided me within a day when requested) is nothing related to support.
