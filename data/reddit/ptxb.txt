"I don't want that million dollars cash because I'd have to pay taxes on it" - some people's logic 
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:49:00
Protip : you can overpay your 2017 taxes to the IRS with a credit card for 2% and they will refund you with your tax return.
Disclaimer : as said above.. Only do this if you already have the money or will already have it when it's time to pay it back.

More like teenagers &amp; dude-bros coming up to you telling you how sweet your car is or wanting to race.

IMO Tether is pretty much a scam, but one that can be kept up indefinitely. It's basically a fiat currency.
Think of the shift when the US switched from the Gold standard to fiat. Some might call that a scam too.
So the fact that Tether can keep this up indefinitely and that it makes up a small % of the BTC market cap I would say it's something to keep an eye out for, but not a show stopper. Could definitely cause a large short term crash though if they go insolvent (read: buying opportunity).

It means you (the buyer) would agree to the obligation of buying BTC at $16,090 from the seller at that specific date.
What that looks like in practice as a cash settled future is this:
If the price skyrockets the seller owes you the dollar amount that you would have payed extra to buy BTC. e.g. - Contract was for $16k, but expired in Jan. with BTC at $20k. The seller now owes you $4k to make up for that "loss" on your end.
If the price plummets you now owe the seller whatever the different between the current price and the contract price since you "promised" to buy at the contract price. E.g - Contract was at $16k but BTC dropped to $10k. You now owe the seller $6k.
As for how the market behaves? Not really sure. I guess it's based on what the current price is doing and what the investors believe will happen. i.e - Super simplified: If the market tanks to $10 per BTC the futures probably will probably drop too since it's unlikely to make a $16k gain in one month.

It's funny because where I'm from "dope" means good. I don't think that's what you meant though.

See my prediction [this morning](
Prediction now for the next 24 hours is that we will probably reach a new ATH or at least 18-19k levels. We're on track to break the 16.5k resistance level and then from there it's a very large breakout upwards.
Notice the [pennant]( created in the last few days (1d chart). We are now witnessing a continuation of that.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:52:18
Yup agreed. That's not to say I don't think institutions will eventually try to exploit it one way or another, but the belief that the market is going to crash / have some huge rally right away is unfounded.
Institutional traders will login this evening/tomorrow morning and think "huh this is neat" and mull it over for a few days. It's only in the coming weeks that we will see what the effects really are.

Anyone else find this whole "surprise" BCH release a bit suspect by Coinbase? These are smart people.. they knew it was going to cause a lot of volatility and the crash when launched out of nowhere like that. And then you look at the price of BCH since yesterday and clearly there was some insider knowledge there.
Combine those two factors and it looks almost intentional. All very peculiar execution and timing on their part.
How do you position yourself as a serious exchange when you just do things willy nilly? Institutional investors are probably wondering WTF is going on right now.
Furthermore, the price of BCH is so conveniently frozen at 9500 USD leaving novice users to think that is a normal price.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:46:21
Nothing wrong with that just know that you're paying a little extra fees on most exchanges for market orders.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:45:17
And a better charting system. Looking at only the order book tells me fuck all about price action over the long term.
Cue the smartass who says "durr all the info you need is right there". No, no it's not, unless you have a photographic memory.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:37:47
No problem! After mulling it over a bit I realize it doesn't even matter whether it's  physically or cash settled for this arbitrage to work.
i.e - I think they are probably doing this already.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:39:34
Not sure why it's at that price, but basically it's agreement that the buyer has the obligation to purchase BTC from the seller at 16.5k from the seller on some specific date in January. It's cash settled so there's no actual BTC changing hands, but it's easier to think of it this way.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:50:12
Correct. Not sure what the sensation is about. If you don't owe any taxes... Great.. You're fine. If you do owe taxes.. Pay them in January and you're fine. This isn't some plot against crypto lol.
This is investing 101 stuff.
The IRS literally just wants their money.. That's it. They give fuck all about the rest.

My prediction for today as of 1:51AM EST.
Europe will feel bullish this morning. Followed by another rally at 6pm when people realize that the futures will not have any immediate consequences.
The uncertainty is reflected in the volatility of the past day or so. Once people see that world hasn't ended I'm expecting a breakout of the 14-15k range with a decent rally possibly up to 16.5k levels.
9:33pm price has now hit $16.5k level as I predicted. :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:14:57
Exactly. That's my understanding of it now. Too bad us little fish can get into these arbitrage opportunities.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:27:34
I'm not saying this wont happen, but I find it very unlikely to expect this on Sunday or early next week.
Whales may be big and powerful, but they don't move THAT fast. And it wouldn't make sense for their opening salvo to be something hostile like this. Seems like a good way to scare away your potential prey.
Sticking with the marine life analogy ... that'd be like going fishing first thing in the morning at 6am and starting the day off by throwing dynamite into the water.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:47:10
I personally would not as I like to have more "buffer" to work with, but if you got in this morning at 14k or so I would keep on HODLing.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:09:59
If that is what your are convinced of and you trust yourself then why not? Maybe you will be right.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:49:38
As of 1:48AM EST I'm gonna venture a guess that Europe is in a buy kind of mood.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:06:34
Yup. I'm a huge fan of cars, but this doesn't make sense to me. It's one thing to buy a house or take a risk starting a business or something like that, but to piss it away on a car that loses 20% of its value the moment you drive off the lot doesn't make much sense. To each their own.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:38:29
Not sure, but I can't wait. This will equalize the playing field reallll quick.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:34:54
Read another Bloomberg writer stating pretty much the same. They were comparing the CBOE futures to nasdaq and copper futures. No fucking shit its tiny in comparison. It hasn't even been 24 hours. $50 million in trades is not a bad start.
It's almost like they need to assuage their own fears/FOMO so they write these articles. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:35:32
Just saw this and I'm in disbelief. This is a joke right? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:51:48
Okay. If you want to be pedantic about it there are 830,771,000 USDT and 
16.4 million Bitcoins in circulation at a value of about 15k per coin.
Assuming every single USDT is in BTC than that means Tether makes up for 0.33% of the market. A drop in the bucket.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:25:24
Pretty sure that was a whale capitalizing on that huge arbitrage during that moment. There was something like a $1k spread between the futures and spot price when that happened. 5%+ instant risk free profit 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:15:47
It's not even a dumb question.. plenty of futures are physically settled. It just so happens this CBOE futures are cash settled.
You are exactly right though. If it were physically settled that is definitely one strategy. It's also the kind of "intended" purpose for futures in the way that a corn farmer might lock in a future price for their crop. They don't care about making a huge windfall they just want that stable/viable future price.

The futures market opens today at 6pm New York time. Not sure why people keep saying "Monday Monday Monday". No not Monday. Today. At 6pm. Nothing will happen.

Tl;Dr trading is not for everyone

Returns could be smaller? Huh? People do realize percentage values are relative right? 7% is 7% doesn't matter if the price is at 1MM or 1 dollar.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:26:55
So I deleted my comment because I hadn't thought it thru 100%, but after re-thinking I stand by what I said.
If you bought BTC at $15k and short sell the futures contract at $16k you are making $1k no matter what. Prove me wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:59:33
I like you. Cheers to that
