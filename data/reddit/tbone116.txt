I don't know why people are down voting you on this. I live in Ohio. We are the only state where you can pay your business taxes with BTC. You are 100% correct in saying they use a payment processor and convert it to fiat. Baby steps people.

You would have to pay on the 10 percent gain you made. Just like if you bought stock and only sold some. Also if you sell after you have held it for over a year you would pay long term gains. Long term is 15% tax up to 400k then it is 20% after that. Short term holdings of under a year will be taxed as income.

I invested 20% when it was 700 bucks now it is like 80% of my wealth. lol

Check out GBTC. You could buy in that on Robinhood.

Did you have long or short term gains?

If you need someone to store your wealth, you need a better way to store wealth.

That is some real noob shit right there. lol

Do you have an etrade account? You can buy GBTC like a stock. It is a BTC holding trust. You are investing in BTC without actually owning it. I have some GBTC in my retirement account. I also hold real BTC on a hardware wallet.

I feel like all of these major networks are in it with the banks and wall street. I don't take much stock in what they say. They are going to shake people from there Bitcoin as long as they can. It is really kind of obvious. Look at the start of 2017. They were looking for anyone that knew anything about Bitcoin to put on the air. They don't know there ass from a hole in the ground about crypto.

I like Yang.
@_date: 2019-08-17 05:26:35
I'm worried about that also.

Sorry. English is my 3rd language.

Seems we gaze at the same crystal ball. The only thing is May 2020 is close enough to the election that if he is still in office, removing him at that point may seem to political. Seems they would move fast to get it done by the end of the year.

same here. I'm way tuned out. Don't give a shit about anything on cable.

I'm not down with all his ideas. You have to admit thou he is the only person who is talking about ALL the stuff that matters. He is smart as a whip and would put good people around him. He is the anti Trump in my eyes. If people supported him I think he could move the country forward.
@_date: 2019-08-17 05:28:03
Not for us. Big boys club only.

When are you going to realize Fox takes something and spins and spins and spins it again until YOU think it is a big deal. Fox news really is fucking up our country.

When he is impeached will trump tards go wild? Will they try and start a revolution?
@_date: 2019-10-24 04:49:11
Is there an escrow we can use for this bet? I'll go $250.00 Trump is getting impeached. The Dems are just making an easy case rock solid. They know they have to have their ducks in a row so the AR-15 Army doesn't go buck wild. It is coming.

Bitcoin lives in their head like it is on a paper wallet.
@_date: 2019-10-24 03:43:45
I think depending on how old you are it would be foolish not to be cash right now. If your close to retirement I would not have 100% exposure to the market.
@_date: 2019-10-24 04:06:24
yeah he is. Maybe not removed from office. The Dems have no reason to be complicate in his crimes. The Republics do. It will be up to the Republicans to put country before party. If you don't think he has broke the law then your living in a bubble.
@_date: 2019-10-24 03:50:58
I'm 50% in BTC. 5% in gold. 20% in stocks the rest in cash.
