My website is almost 6 months old. We accepted bitcoins in at the end of Feb or beginning or March.  We've only gotten 5 sales, but we are extremely pleased.  We've also switched from the Mtgox payment gateway to bitpay as many people were having trouble with mtgox's payment gateway.

The only thing about individual resellers like this is that you won't be able to get warranty on your unit. Our prices are set with the manufacturer - the lowest price Davinci will let authorized resellers sell their unit at is $199. This means full warranty and support after your purchase, something you won't be getting from google shopping. If we started selling below this, not only would our customers get no warranty, but Davinci may cut us off from selling their product in the future.
As a fan of Bitcoin, I'm also a big fan of free market pricing, so supplier compliance kind of sucks. But we do our best to make up for it with free shipping, free grinders, better support, etc.

We actually have them but did not update the inventory.  Should be fixed! Check again.

On the product page you need to select it under "Free Add Ons" and then add to cart.
