You make it sound like they could avoid both by just keeping interest rates at the right level. If prices decline, just lower interest rates. If hyperinflation, just increase interest rates. Therefore, stability if done right.

Essentially, it means that the transactions don't actually happen on the bitcoin network at all. They are accounted for by an internal, centralized ledger, within a single company's database.

Not necessarily the same hackers - there are lots of hackers out there.
Given the flaws found in other open source software (including Heartbleed), it's not inconceivable that there's a fundamental flaw in Bitcoin that will destroy the whole thing. If that's the case, it would be better to find the vulnerability sooner rather than later, and reliable shorting is one way we'll get there sooner.

Pure/ideal money shouldn't have any other usefulness, except to use as money. The vast majority of gold's value is speculation/what people think it's worth. Its intrinsic/use value is far lower, and represents only a tiny fraction of its price.

agreed. but protocols exist that don't have a network of actual, real-world computing power behind them. when i say "network", i mostly mean the network of miners.

bitcoin's price was irrelevant back then: the market was extremely tiny and *very* thinly traded. there was so little liquidity that one person could move the market significantly; and to some extent, this is still true today. but much more so back then. this is why bitcoin is so volatile and, if you have a long-term view, the price is effectively meaningless (depending on your definition of meaning).

You can't know for sure, but you might know in some cases, especially if the wallet owner has published their extended public key. Most heuristics are based on the amounts of the transactions, since product prices tend to follow certain patterns (whole numbers, or prices that end in "99", etc.)

However, it's important to note that this can be done with a Softfork. It does not require a Hardfork.
And in the long term, I think this could reduce transaction fees by incentivizing the miners to include at least a minimum amount of transaction data (or # of transactions).
You might think that this would encourage miners to just pad blocks, but at that point, they might as well include legit transactions!

How can we verify that your paper wallet generator is secure?
Also, you may want to add a warning on there about the sensitivity of the private key; and the fact that any component in between the generator and the paper could steal it. e.g. a compromised printer, or a printer that stores in memory a history of docs it has printed.
@_date: 2014-04-11 04:41:06
Can do with just Softfork, and can start it at a block height far in the future, so that miners have time to upgrade.

I completely disagree. There are few competitors, and they all have technical problems as well. It's a cutting-edge, nascent market.

Not the same thing. When you get your Overstock dollars, a computer program can automatically and practically instantly convert them to bitcoins, as you so desire.

No, the $28.4m number was just made up by CoinDesk, on the assumption that bidders bid market price. Your calculation comes out to greater than market because bidders in aggregate bid for more than 30k coins). Barry Silbert did not state anything that would imply $28.4m, and in fact the total aggregate bid was almost certainly far lower than that.

Your salary is likely denominated in bitcoin and can be instantly converted to bitcoin at market rate when you receive it, similar to the way some people are paid their salary in bitcoin today (denominated in USD and exchanged for USD, if the employee so desires).
For example: Today, everyone at Coinbase is paid in bitcoin, but many of them quickly convert most of it to dollars upon receipt.
