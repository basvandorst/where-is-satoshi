Do some research lol

All you hodlers are funny. Hope y’all know it can’t continue to rise like it has been. Don’t get your hopes up
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:37:44
And those are just the top 2. Do some research 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:47:01
Fucking look it up lol 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:15:01
About $5500

Bro look it up and tell me how it’s gonna just keep on climbing. It’s virtually impossible. Even the last week has been a standstill and that’s with they hype higher than its ever been 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:04:32
I found something that nets more money. Check any other crypto currency for asking price lol

Look it up if those aren’t good enough for you. In the scheme of inflation it’s impossible for a crypto currency to continue to just keep going up. Literal gold, GOLD, couldn’t do it so why would a fucking virtual coin do it. It might be hot now but you’re gonna want to sell pretty soon. Like I said I’ve made more money investing in things from the money I sold from bitcoin lol. Best decision ever 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:38:02
Sold my bitcoin and invested in other currencies. Will be more profitable in the long run 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:40:46
I’ll take things that didn’t happen for 200 Alex 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:03:41
Ehhh not really missing much 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:57:31
Says the guy typing like a kid 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:19:25
Actually a pretty good bit of them. And also one of the biggest investors is about to sell his. I’m smart enough to take the hints 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:25:01
Bitcoin experts are even saying it’s not possible for it to continue to rise like this. Don’t be ignorant 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:32:42
You must not research a whole lot. And I bet you’re that guy that thinks one bitcoin is gonna be worth millions soon lol. Sold mine and invested elsewhere and have already made more money. No regrets at all 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:31:41
Hahahah do what your username says to do. And see what you’re saying a couple months from now
