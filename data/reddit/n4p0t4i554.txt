No, Europe still sucks compared to the US. I live in the EU and there is no discount broker where I live. I also don't want to submit kyc/aml documentation. Abra is perfect for me.

It's so cheap because nobody is using it in the real world. Ok, ok...almost nobody. To become global money only your significant transactions would be done on layer 1 like buying a house or a car. The rest would go on layer 2 like lightning. Anybody 'member late 2017 fees when it was used by more people?

Haha what a madlad using bitcoin for something you don't want to get caught with. PSA. Bitcoin doesn't hide anything. It broadcasts everything worldwide. The sender(you), the receiver, the sum and the timestamp.


No coding skills?  Has he ever read the Bitcoin whitepaper or read some commits from the Bitcoin repo? Has he ever read about the crypto market in general? I wouldn't have touched crypto If I wasn't reading code. Tell him to put in money he's ready to lose.

Is counterfeiting good for the economy? No. Inflation is counterfeiting. Making copies of notes each iteration stealing some purchasing power of your money. You can't copy an ounce of gold or counterfeit a Bitcoin. Over years it compounds a lot. Mainstream economics is keynesian propaganda. It's funny how they hamster their thinking to justify theft of our purchasing power through inflation to fund megalomaniac state projects and wars. An inflationary society is a society of moral decay, instant gratification, everything build like a house of cards. No wonder Keynes said "in the long run we're all dead".

right this way to . oh shit that sub too is overrun with statists and keynesians.
Gold is money and it was money for thousand of years. Only hardcore statist intervention is keeping it from being used. Somebody making gold backed currency would be thrown in prison by the organized crime syndicate called the state. The state doesn't like competition. Read about the liberty dollar. Legal tender laws need to be abolished.

Sound money is the foundation of healthy economic growth not central bank fake inflated paper.

Finally governments showing what they really are. Violent monopolists. Bands of robbers writ large. A free market should have a choice in currency.

Miss the days when business only cared if your money was still green. You guys are right that a business has a right to ban whomever it wants but the last business I'd suspect wanting to ban clients based on political views is one that deals with Bitcoin. Their days are numbered. All hail censorship resistant anonymous decentralized platforms like Bisq, OpenBazaar etc.

Things started backsliding in the last 10 years.
