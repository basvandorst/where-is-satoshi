Publicly run what? Democracy? Then you worry about tyranny of the majority.

The question is, how do you manage and control a system without using large power structures like the government intervening, and subsequently, abusing this power?

Ahhh, the "sins of the father" justification. Your parents birthed you here, ergo, you owe the state your life! Sound logic there.

And this, ladies and gentlemen, is a textbook example of the fallacy of moving the goalposts. You said...




In which I have provided such an example. Your claims were bad and you should feel bad. Keep digging yourself a hole there sport. You've already been torn to shreds enough already by almost everybody in this thread. You'd think your continued humiliation would be enough to introduce a bit of humility. But nope. Those progressive tea partiers don't go down without a fight?

You know their exists knowledge and information outside of Wikipedia right? There are *thousands* of websites out there more in depth than Wikipedia. There are also these wonderful things called books which also hold information. 
I'm not an Icelandic historian but I've done a fair bit of reading on the subject. Maybe you should be a little more open minded and try to learn something instead of being a close minded, ignorant asshole, simply because there are facts out there that may go against your preconceived notions of reality.

The Icelandic commonwealth. Lasted 300 years before kings came in and started controlling everything.

Nobody thinks you should be well versed in all world societies. That has nothing to do with it. It's because you asked for an example of a stateless society, I gave you one, you admit you know nothing about it, then say ignorant bullshit like this


This is why you are an ignorant piece of trash. Know nothing about a piece of history, then automatically start on your Koch rampage. You are the epitome of the close-minded, ignorant liberal without an original thought in his head. The liberal version of a tea partier.

No, no. A close-minded, *ignorant* asshole. One who admits he knows *nothing* about Icelandic history, yet continues to spew ignorant, baseless garbage simply because it come from a different viewpoint than your specific worldview. The very definition if willful ignorance. I will admit that takes pretty big balls to talk so much shit something you admit you are clueless about.

What does that have to do with anything? Because a group of facts supports a specific viewpoint means any site hosting those facts skews them or misrepresents them? 
By the way, I absolutely did *not* first hear about it on a libertarian site. It was mentioned in a left-anarchist blog, which set off my research. Why don't you look into it yourself instead of continuing to make yourself sound like a fool.
