Is the content stored on a blockchain? How does it scale?
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:52:41
We have seen this kind of behavior in ProtoShares early 2013 .. back after a snapshort, the difficulty oscilated so badly that the chain that used to confirm transactions in 4 mins (on average) took 4 days to do so .. 
Hope that doesnt happen to bitcoin

Its called oscillation and positive feedback ..

Every single centralized exchange could frontrun their own customers easily since they process their own orderbooks. That is part of the problem and i suspect that many in the crypto ecosystem do that while not many customers realize this as you just did.
The only countermeasure would be to move your trading to a platform with open and trustless orderbooks and public order processing algorithms and the only exchanges that can do so are 'decentralized' exchanges.
I wonder how long it will take until people understand all their benefits

Erm, arent private keys starting with '6' supposed to be encrypted with bip32?

Thanks for the great analysis!
However, you assume a fixed supply. Sure, Bitcoin has a fixed supply, but given the technology behind bitcoin (blockchain, decentralized consensus, etc...) we could create a protocol that includes an asset with a flexible supply by using contracts for difference.
Essentially, you can borrow a token with a face-value by putting collateral in a safe-box that can only be opened up to redeem the collateral if the borrowed tokens are returns.
If you now combine this with the requirements that the collateral should be worth 150% or more of the borrowed token, you get a contract for difference with a safe-box (which can be implemented as smart contract).
If you want to read more, you should check out those two projects:
* MakerDAO
* BitShares
@_date: 2015-12-02 21:58:02
Why is that? A safe box can be decentralized. A contract can be made against the network/software.
So why cant it be decentralized?

Metal is for pre-sale buyers only :) they have cost 3btc each 
@_date: 2015-12-02 15:57:22
If you assume a system like Bitcoin, then your statement is true. If you used a system that is capable of offering contracts-for-difference that creates a fungible asset and destroys it again when the CFD is closed .. now then you get a flexible supply and could track any underlay with it.

I learn nothing from your claims. Prove them .. then we talk.
My initial post contained a link. No claims, no FUD, no selling points, just plain info written by someone else namely dan larimer.
@_date: 2015-12-03 06:49:04


I wouldn't claim it's "perfect" but Daniel Larimer uses "predictability" to define stability.
If you can predict wit a certain confidence that a token or asset 
worth X today will be worth c*X in one year, then it feels stable if c is small.
@_date: 2018-09-04 10:43:19
.. at least not in general and not in all juristictions.
@_date: 2015-12-03 06:45:43
And my point was that any fixed supply asset cannot be used to achieve a stable "price" or "valuation".


Thanks, but I disagree .. although I understand your reasoning. I think if you had all (or close to) value stored in bitcoin on a global scale, then your theory would probably work out and bitcoin behaves like gold and has a rather stable valuation. Until then, there is no way of using bitcoin in as a payment solution due to its volatility.

Now imaging this: You sell a device for a fixed price in BTC. The pre-sale period is several months. The device was shipped a year later. The price of BTC was between 600$ and 900$ in that time per SINGLE BTC!
So 3BTC was way more than that.
P.S. you guys start to realize that pricing in BTC is a stupid idea as long as btc is volatile?

Yes I did BUT they are the only once that can access funds in there as I registered those names with the public keys that correspond to THEIR private keys ... once anybody send funds there I will not have the ability to either see that (because of TITAN) nor will I every be able to spend them. I just registered a name in their behalf that they can access using THEIR private key!!
So the FSF will be the ONLY one that can access funds from there. no need to label it "not FSF"!


why so aggressive? I do not control these "wallets" (in fact they are called accounts or account names) .. they do .. and they are the only once! If I send funds there .. and they decide to not take them they will be LOST .. FOREVER!


Sorry to hear. Actually I was never addressing YOU but the FSF, seansoutpost and amani-kinderdorf.
Further I do not see that I reacted unpolite in anyway? @ If I offended you in any way I apologize!
Additionally, it seems (at least to me) that you either did not read the whole post, or just did not understand it. I feel sorry for you.
If you decide to come back and want some more information about this you are welcome!
For all others that see this as a scam: I do want to spend funds towards them .. not the other way round. If they feel uncomfortable redeeming their shares the way I proposed, it is ok. an we can figure something out to solve it!
The purpose if this post is to REACH them. Nothing else!

Almost, the checksum of btsx pubkeys is ripmed150 and not sha256 as in btc ..
The patch for pycoin is 2 lines long: 
    +             myhash     = encoding.ripemd160( myeccpoint ).digest(  )
    +             print("BTSX PubKey:     %s" % BTS_ADDRESS_PREFIX + encoding.b2a_base58(myeccpoint + myhash[ :4 ]))


BitShares-X uses TITAN. It is basically the same as stealth addresses in
bitcoin. The "registration" is nothing more then storing a
account-name&lt;-&gt;pubkey pair in the blockchain with account names being unique!


The account name directly refers to the pubkey. It is just more convenient to use a name instead of a pubkey.
Registering a account name makes your name public to the rest of the network. Registered names can be looked up to get the pubkey. It's basically a simplified DNS scheme.
The reason I registered their BTC pubkey is transparency .. so that the people
can verify I do not put the donations into my own pockets. Just transparency!
Anything else that is unclear?

there is not MITM issue here. Let me explain using seans outpost
Going to their webpage I found their BTC address
* 
* bitcoin: 1M72Sfpbz1BPpXFHz9m3CdqATR44Jvaydd
As they used the bitcoin address already, the bitcoin blockchain knows about
the public key for that address. You can get it via blockchain.info:
* 
Using the pyCoin utility (with a patch for btsx) you can convert the pubkey
into a BTSX pubkey:
    $ bu 0311662101d5ab530cd6ed3ab7a0ec5a0c2f6c50eb14ba376959250cedff1e6fcc

    BTSX public key: BTSX6xtxncWbza5QJvMBZRA5GXfHnnkvgqiZjpzZYuvsGTqrBPX2wb
As you can see, the bitcoin address matched the one found at the webpage.
In the last line, it states the btsx pubkey that corresponds to that public
key. In BitShares-X you can now register ANY account name to reference to this
particular pubkey. That is what I did:
    &gt;&gt;&gt; blockchain_get_account BTSX6xtxncWbza5QJvMBZRA5GXfHnnkvgqiZjpzZYuvsGTqrBPX2wb
    Name: seansoutputs.donations.charity

    Owner Key: BTSX6xtxncWbza5QJvMBZRA5GXfHnnkvgqiZjpzZYuvsGTqrBPX2wb
    Active Key History:
    - BTSX6xtxncWbza5QJvMBZRA5GXfHnnkvgqiZjpzZYuvsGTqrBPX2wb, last used 21 days ago
Once I or anyone else sends funds to that account-name (and thus to that
pubkey) only those that own the particular private key can access that funds.
* Not MITM

Does this make sense to you or shall I elaborate in more details?

actually it is not "interest" in the traditional sense although the amount of bitUSD (and other bitassets) IN YOUR account increases .. we are not talking about an increased supply as eg. in NXT or PPC .. 
in btsx, the "interest" is a YIELD and comes from trading fees that are redistributed to ALL holders of the particulat bitasset ..
if many people trade bitUSD .. then the yield in bitUSD is bigger ..
at the same time, if people trade just a few bitGLD (yes, you read right.. GOLD) .. then the yield (again .. you read right .. yield on your GOLD holdings!!) .. will be smaller ..
* the yield is payed for each bitasset individually
* comes from trading fees
* does not increase supply!

*agreed*  .. at least in parts ... you need to make sure that trades cannot be reversed .. and you need to make sure that they are executed in their proper order ... however .. I still don't get the argument of why trades need to execute in sub-seconds regime ..


Thanks for the specs! I still miss to understand why these latencies are required for "price-discovery" ..

I totally agree .. and not everyone should create their own altcoin .. that's just not usefull .. But the technology has ALOT more potential than just storing the amount of satoshi I own in an address.


Let's assume there was a blockchain could handle faster transactions .. like (&lt;10 secs) and let's assume that blockchain was able to store more than just "x satoshi belong to address y" .. something along the line "x amount of asset y are locked as collateral for asset z" .. then you could build a "blockchain" that not only can model a decentralized exchange .. but you could also build a blockchain that offers loans/leverage ..
Or do you think the bitfinex database that stores the leverages cannot be stored in a blockchain too?

That is exactly how this kind of problem is tackled in BitShares and STEEM. Basically every transaction links to a specific pair of blockheight/blockid and thus is only valid on a particular chain .. Actually, it i part of the consensus mechnism of DPOS (usually called TaPOS/DPOS) and also ensures that transactions are only valid on a specific (short-term) 'fork'

This doesn't really answer the question as to WHY they need it that fast?!
At least here in Germany, you need to pay tax (25%) for trading gains you made within 12 months .. So there is no incentive to buy and sell within seconds .. 
Besides that, I totally agree with the rest of your post. Once you made an agreement with a trading partner, the technical "swapping" of assets should not have a counterparty risk!

How "fast" would orders need to be processed to be considered sufficiently "fast"? 1 min, 30 secs? 10 secs? 1 sec?


I don't see an issue here .. BitShares does this already .. they have market pegged assets and user-issued assets .. what would prevent them to add yet another feature to allow more derivatives ...

The SSH protocol is wrapped in a TCP package that is packed in an IP package ... later you will even see headers for PPP, MPLS ... 
However, I did not claim you could read the content of the SSH connection .. but you can still identify it is SSH by analysing everything above layer 3 (IP). Routers actually do that .. its called deep-packet inspection to prevent people from using TOR.

@_date: 2016-01-14 16:05:28
I gently disagree. The next step to take for governments is to define rules for decentralized exchanges.
We **do** have rules for digital money (e.g. bitcoin) in most countries already but most governments do **not** have any idea of the legal implications of **decentralized** exchanges.
Main issue here may turn out to be the fact that **everyone** can enter a DEX as implemented in Counterparty, Omni, BitShares, NXT, etc. ... in contrast to centralized (big) exchanges where you would need to go via broker to be on the safe (legal) side of things.
Things get very difficult (for governments) once you start trading derivatives on a blockchain, like they are offere in BitShares. Tell me, does your government see tokens that represent the value of its underlay as financial instrument?
Those are the questions a government should start looking into ..

I agree, however, we have 2015, and as things evolve people see the bitcoin protocol as a combination of different technologies (as Satoshi did too, btw) ..
we have 
* the decentralized ledger (blockchain)
* the consensus scheme (POW)
* and the tokens (satoshi)
one particular chain implements these features (more or less equally) .. Bitcoin was the first (almost) .. then there was Litecoin and all the others ..
So .. IMHO, the technology is way different from what an actual implementation like Bitoin,litecoin,peercoin does ..

Trying to "ban" bitcoin traffic is close to impossible. All traffic can be hidden somehow.
If I was a government agency that wants to attack bitcoin, I would simply go for the miners directly and shut them down all at once (those located in China). That would have the same effect of a network that suddenly loses alot of POW power.
I sill imagine how the recent spikes in difficulty could be the beginnig of an attack right after the next difficulty retarget.
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:13:56
That only holds true if you can *DISTINGUISH* the chains. However, until you fix the *replay* issue in bitcoin's wire format, there is simply no way to prevent (pending) transactions from hopping over to the other network. Period.
Once you fixed that, then you can start redefining Satoshi's words.
@_date: 2016-06-09 13:41:08

It is pretty cool and some other consensus schemes have that implemented in protocol level already, they call it TaPOS (transaction as proof of stake) .. basically, it requires all transactions to *link to a specific block* ... 
(you can find TaPOS in Steem, BitShares, PeerPlays, MUSE, ...)
This prevents drama as we have seen in ETH/ETC from happending because your coins would only be able to move in one chain .. not in both.

IMHO the issue is that the bitcoin protocol (even thought it has a means to reach consenus about the blockchain state) does not offer a feasible technique to reach a consensus about the protocol itself. Hence, the protocol is subject to endless discussion and .. evebtually .. hard forking .. unless the btc ecosystem starts to understand its blockchain as a DAC and offers voting capabilities to their shareholders ..
That way you no longer need endless discussions, could reach a consensus AND give all hodlers a say.

My reply at his page:
    How about "voting-by-stake"? Even though the bitcoin protocol does not directly allow for stake-based voting, we can still construct a scheme to let people cast a vote on the bitcoin blockchain by using address-prefixes. It's quite simple:
    1) construct a set of prefixes for each of your choices (options)
     - C1: hardfork for blocksize protocol version 1
     - C2: hardfork for blocksize protocol version 2
     - C3: hardfork for blocksize protocol version 3
    2) The most difficult part (computionally) is this: Each participant int he vote has to construct a new address with the choices in 1) being the prefix of the address:
     - 1C1xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
     - 1C2xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
     - 1C3xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    3) To vote with your stake you can simply construct a transaction that either
      - puts all your funds to vote with into that address, or
      - has all your funds in the input, move them back into same addresses in the outputs minus a few satoshi (more than waste) into the address of your choice.
    4) After the voting period you can simply coin satoshi depending on the address (verifiable) and decide the winner.
    5) done. stake-voting on the bitcoin blockchain
* much simpler
* everyone can do this
* no side-chain required
* can start right away
* some minor computational power is required

Microtransactions are only "complex" (read: difficult to do) on Bitcoin because of the high costs of the consensus scheme in place (PoW).
There are other blockchains that even implement reddit on a chain (including voting) that don't require a fee at all (like STEEM). There, instead of protecting from spamming by means of a fee, they rate-limited the transactions you are allowed to produce by the amount of stake you have. Non of that would be possible if they weren't using DPOS for their consensus.

I totally agree with the OP here and I really don't want to advertise any alternative to ripple, but you may miss the central point of the BitShares DEX. In contrast to ripple, which mainly features IOUs for different banks/exchanges/gateways, the BitShares exchanges features market pegged assets such as bitUSD which are NOT issued by a central authority but by 200%-300% collateral locked into a short order.
In BitShares, a gateway REALLY is a gateway in such that it is the entrance point for FIAT in the same way ripple does, namely with IOUs. But the difference now is, that you can exchange 1 bitstampUSD into a bitUSD trading with someone that wants to move out of bitUSD.
All of this is still worth nothing as long as there are no merchants accepting bitUSD. That would be quite nice :)
Now, go ahead and vote me down!

@_date: 2015-04-15 07:08:08
which is different from finding bitcoin ..
you can construct a block with zero btc in the coinbase address and still find the correct **nonce for the hash** .. but would end up with zero bitcoin
@_date: 2015-04-20 06:17:20


You say it. Personally, I would never use a hard-wired bitcoin wallet where I cannot possibly verify the random number generator. The only 'hardware' that makes sense to have integrated on circuit is the ECC and that just isn't a big thing IMHO
@_date: 2015-04-09 06:47:51
yes I did .. 
gonna retry later ..
@_date: 2015-04-19 12:10:28
Your paper can sign a btc transaction?
At least you need a pen for the ECC signature, don't you?

It is delegated proof of stake and definitely not a altcoin. But it has its own blockchain that not only carries market pegged asstes like bitUSD and bitGOLD but also carries user issued assets like MOONFUND or NOTE.

Yet again, we end up in the discussion of commodity vs. currency.
Also, you cannot use a commodity (Gold) to defend Bitcoin as a currency. That makes you look silly.
Last but not least, Bitcoin is, tobmy understanding NOT a currency but may well be money.
@_date: 2015-11-18 09:48:51


I disagree .. while it makes Bitcoin unique, profound and powerful, it is not "pointless" at all! It allows to distribute your database on a global scale with a profable history/record. Noone can tamper with previous states of the database!

People are more inclined innovating the blockchain technology because thats the actual innovation. 
Besides that I agree on the developers part of the OP.
Sure, this sub doesn't want to hear that, so please vote me down.
@_date: 2015-11-18 11:52:56
I get your point .. even though its technically a little more complicated
@_date: 2015-11-18 09:53:36
I **agree** with what you say! Thing is .. the blockchain can do way more than just store address&lt;-&gt;satoshi pairs. And that is why bitcoin either has to improve itself or will be overtaken by more powerful alternatives.
As you said, it's just a matter of network effect and if you take closer look at the TOP10 in "market cap", you'll see a majority of project that are far superior to bitcoin technologically .. Bitcoin's 5 years-in-market .. is what makes it the TOP1 .. definitely not the technology .. any more

you misunderstand the concept. If you are the only one that is allowed to produce block you cannot alter the history with out altering every block after it ... this only works for non-public chain but not for those that publish their blocks openly. The a change can be detected and the block producer will loss credibility.

All of them should be DACzed to let all shareholders profit .. not just the bosses ..

I didn't make myself clear it seems: "Why is a smartcard more secure **than the TreZor**?
@_date: 2015-11-18 11:52:00
And how is a smartcard more resistant to that? Mifare smart cards have neen reverse engineer aswell (though at a higher cost i would assume)
@_date: 2016-05-18 09:14:25
Its called 'synopsis". You can borrow the code from BitShares
@_date: 2015-11-18 20:56:38
You do understand the concept of a concatenated list with ids being hashes of the prev. block? If you did, you should re-read your previous post. Neither the token, nore POW have anything to do with the immutability of the blockchain.
I bet I can construct an immutable database without token and pow and still have the blockchain be decentralized!!!
@_date: 2015-03-27 17:28:32
Btw .. you can also have Gold in there and trade both of them against bitUSD ... quite awesome
@_date: 2015-03-28 19:52:12

@_date: 2015-10-28 17:45:22
The blockchain is an immutable database and has nothing to do with distributed or not .. what you guys seem to mean is blockchain+consensus
@_date: 2015-10-02 09:48:10
With every advantage comes a disadvantage. As an engineer, I can tell you most requirements are **orthogonal**
@_date: 2015-11-18 10:42:06
I don't see how *reverse engineering* the micro controller can help you retrieve the private key (which is stored in its memory)
Reverse engineering could only help you if the private key is stored as *wired logic* and I really hope that that's not the case for the smart card. I would assume it stores the keys in it's internal memory as well at what point it would be essentially equivalent to the trezor.
Else, I agree with everything you just said!
@_date: 2015-03-20 06:50:38
Same with centralized exchanges that follow regulatzions, btw ..
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:39:00
Well .. bitshares is doing just fine because it has a governance systen that allows updating the fee schedule .. and it scales nicely as you can see from recent on-chain traffic
@_date: 2015-03-29 21:15:53
Depends on the actual blockchain tech, the language and the project for which you are searching .. have some more details?

@_date: 2016-05-26 14:45:04
Don't see the issue here. Blockchain is one tech and POW another one. Even satoshi acknowledged that as he simple put those two existing techs together to create bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-03-08 10:51:03
Are there plans to allow shorting of bitBTC with bitUSD as collateral?
@_date: 2015-02-18 14:38:04
What you say doesn't may too much of a sense ..
Running with costumer funds is alot easier than removing the domain and disappear
@_date: 2015-11-18 09:50:19
Distributed consensus has nothing to do with the blockchain.
The blockchain really is only an immutable database. The "protocol", may it be POW or POW, may it contain a DEX or not, is what defines HOW to achieve a consensus.
Anyway, this discussion is a lost effort in this sub.
@_date: 2015-10-30 11:34:47
Please distinguish between how the OLD blocks are stored and how the NEW blocks are added .. the OLD blocks are stored in the blockchain while the consensus and protocol defines how a NEW block has to look like

You cant replace an old block without requiring to replace all blocks after that one as well!
@_date: 2015-02-19 17:55:22
the issue is not the volatility against the USD but that BTC also has volatility in buying power .. and that is something you dont want for anything you use as a currency .. for speculating its nice though

I recommend to read the whitepaper at steem.io. It clarified some understandings of the OP.

These papers in the bitcoin whitepaper reference other papers that describe the structtre of "a blockchain" ( So I would argue that "the blockchain part" was invented before  bitcoin.
Else I agree, the "blockchain" is just a part of "blockchain technologies", but I see it as an integral part of the unterlying technology behind bitcoin and not a by-product.
To me:
blockchain technology = blockchain storage + p2p consensus mechanism + protocol/business logic
