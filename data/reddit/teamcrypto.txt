How could an exchange run transactions off of the blockchain?  
**EDIT: Never mind, I'm an idiot.  I guess if someone sent money from one Coinbase account to another Coinbase would just change their own ledger.  That and they can hold more or less Bitcoin depending on their preferences rather than selling it all immediately.**

I wouldn't say it's entirely unrelated -- it does answer my question to some degree if there are a relatively large number of off-blockchain transactions (and that that number is increasing).  I just wanted to know the best way to counter the argument, "the number of transactions (at least on blockchain) hasn't seemed to move much over the last few months."

Ugh I JUST bought a couple of shirts today via PayPal -- I wish I had known to look for Bitcoin as a checkout option.  There's no logo for it next to the other options on the main page.

It's also possible this person has knowledge of the inner workings of trading algorithms that, at least in part, derive some type of sentiment value from the posts on If that's the case, manipulating the front page of could be pretty profitable...

He's a value investor, so it's typical of him to ask these types of questions and look on a larger scale.

Everything seemed functional initially so I sent a little bit of coin over to the app's wallet but now I'm perpetually getting a "not connected" message...  Anyone else have this issue?
**EDIT: Deleted and reinstalled app and it was able to sync.**

I'd like to see that comparison...

I guess looking at something like this:  (2 years of that using a 7-day average) looks a bit better.  It just seemed fairly flat the past few months given the amount of good press and general community sentiment I've noticed over that time period.

theSkimm does have a pretty good number of subscribers, but it's more of a daily email digest of current events than a blog. I just thought it was cool to see that they did a Bitcoin "guide" (they've done "guides" for other subjects as well).

I'm curious about this too.  Is their blockchain data unreliable?  Why?  Is it just off-blockchain transactions that they miss?
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:13:44
He's right. You're trusting that the api that fetches the blockchain height will only ever return a number. If the server hosting the api code were hacked or someone even just did some type of MiTM to replace the expected return with something else, you could have a code execution situation on your hands. Same reason why it would be terrible to call eval() with unvalidated user input in a node.js backend — you open up the door to server-side JS injection.

You can just add a check that the api call is returning an int and I think the rest is fine

He doesn't think it has stagnated, but was just curious why volume hasn't grown even faster.

Hadn't heard of that, but a simple IPS (at least for blocking brute force attempts) is definitely a good idea.

I met you guys after YC Demo Day a few weeks ago when I walked into Molly Magees in Mountain View with a friend on a Tuesday night not expecting more than a couple of beers in a relatively empty bar...
Glad to hear things are going well!
