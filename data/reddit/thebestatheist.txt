I’ll eat my left nut if we are still Reddit-ing in 2040...��

Fucking $25,000,000. It’s crazy to think about, but it’s also crazy to think he’d still have that if it rode up to $100 per coin. Almost all of us would’ve sold.

RemindMe! 6 months 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:33:52
I like what you’re thinking. Why do you see a price of just $7,800? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:01:00
DO IT!!! You found your moon! 
I'm happy for you, u/pureneckbeard

mBTC certainly makes me sound a lot more awash in bitcoin... 
@_date: 2018-08-13 21:08:21
LMAO Now I have seen everything
@_date: 2018-05-16 20:10:49
I had a friend who had about 300 BTC a couple years back...He used them to buy weed/other drugs on the Silk Road. 
I always ask him "remember when you had $6 million in bitcoin? (at peak price)"
I have been told to fuck myself hundreds of times by now.
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:41:12
Yeah haha hindsight is 20/20. Next time I’ll listen to my gut and hold those coins. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:12:20
I had 50 at one point. I still feel sick about it because I told myself many times to hold it for the future value. I sold mine off over time to buy dumb shit. Oh well, live and learn I suppose! 
@_date: 2018-05-10 19:32:49
Cheers, you great human being. 
Hope you have a wonderful life. Thanks for helping so many.

I read back and couldn’t find any time when someone said it wasn’t his house to wager. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:53:47
I wouldnt say jack shit about it until she's way, way out of the picture. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:30:54
Investors are also buying ;)
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:38:48
True. The remaining family members would just lose the house.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:53:15
I just bought $700 more...I am in for the long haul. I am going to do this weekly and build up. I believe in BTC!
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:39:58
Weirder things have happened...I think it will. But I guess we will see. It will turn the masses on to BTC, for sure. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:39:05
But...now she's rich AF.

Hope you're right. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:10:53
Thanks for the input. I have done some traditional trading/speculation in the past but nothing as volatile as Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:12:38
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:02:13
Well, thanks. Can we retire at $100k? :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:29:54
My guess is they're inundated with sell offs. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:54:07
My buy price just now was $10,028 on coinbase.

R0myt, who's delusional now? 
Fuck, I love this. Congrats, u/panther15253!
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:02:28
It will come back. I think it has to do with the major exchanges being down as well.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:06:38
Dammit....That's what I am struggling with. 
I will probably dump a few hundred more in and see how it goes. I dont want to see a massive course correction after spending $20,000+.
I am going to keep buying regardless of what happens, that way if the price tanks I can average down and if it goes up I will have some to build a base with. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:17:48
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:29:12
Well, you've been right so far. I dumped a bunch more money into Bitcoin over the past few days because of stories like yours. Fuck it. I can always make more money. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:24:32
much doom, very scaring
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:37:03
I was looking into that. How have your returns been?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:19:34
If I want to receive bitcoin, is it ok to give the receiving address to someone?
@_date: 2019-04-23 17:02:56
This is a cool idea, and good luck with your book!!
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:23:16
Ah, I know a few of those too. I’ll let them know.

Here's an obligatory bitcoin regret post. 
I had an opportunity to buy bitcoin when it was around $2.00 in Dec 2011. 
I planned on buying $500 worth of it. I think about it every morning when I go to work and remember that I'd have about $1,000,000 right now. I never ended up doing so because I was too lazy to figure out how to pay for it, and because it had just suffered a huge drop. 
I also missed Tesla stock, could've bought that around $60/share. 
I am planning on getting back into BTC, I have been reading they think there will be a drop to $4k what do you guys think?

Does Medicaid cover a lost ass? I know several people who could benefit from that.
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:28:08
Where's the best place to buy bitcoin? Is there some kind of brokerage service? I'm new to all this but I have lots of traditional investments.
