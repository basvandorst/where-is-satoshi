Well my last btc transaction went in 2 days ago and still unconfirmed. This announcement is fuel to the fire

Not doge coin

Tell me the right way to think about it. I don’t picture a bitcoin mortgage anytime soon if ever. Enlighten me

I love it, ride a meme till it can’t be ridden no  more!

Bitcoin/crypto needs to improve itself so that it's easy to use and the issues op described aren't such a problem. Being a condescending snob isn't helping anyone.

I do like it and I do use it. Sounds like you are just a shitty guy
@_date: 2017-09-26 00:04:42
Seems strange.

I've seen one documentary. I find the whole idea very intriguing, just having trouble getting over some of the weak spots in the system. I guess a lot of people are HODLing until such a time that it becomes a more efficient system. Just worried that the fee structure we currently have will impede growth

I don't think they have support at all
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:06:40
No idea how that works
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:39:39
Which ones do you recommend?

I'll have to look into this more

Sure tons of problems with big banks from a big picture point of view. That's why I came  to bitcoin in the first place.  
But if you look at it from a transaction to transaction basis it seems ridiculously inefficient

I hear you. I just feel like if you look at it solely as a stock option/investment it makes sense to pay a broker fee. When you look at it as a currency it has some major hurdles. For it to reach its ultimate potential as an investment these problems need to be solved.

So gdax is a subsidiary of coinbase but doesn't charge the same fees?

I'm no expert but people who seem wiser than myself seem to think it's a good idea to let some of the dust settle after the fork. Maybe for a week
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:34:37
I beg to differ. I sent them an email and have not heard back in 4 days. The the chatter on their sub Reddit I may never hear back. It's not support until they actually do something. Right now it's just a void to toss your questions into
@_date: 2017-09-25 23:49:34
I understand this. What I don't understand is how it makes sense to have to make this trade off decision when a bank has super low fees and insured transactions
