when sharing this post least of all things i had in mind was to request anything from any of you.... not "begging". Obviously it was my  mistake on my part and thankfully lesson learned. An expensive lesson at that.  What is written above is the sentiment the flows within my heart. Time to hop more on the ball. PLEASE YALL. I posted that BTC address not for donations. But literally so you can see my zero balance. You know my experience first hand. And now let me show you how not be get defeated in life by hopping back on the ball and getting back what was mine and some....from square one like the title says. I mainly made this story to share a personal experience of mine and let you all know where I am coming from..... 
Its life 
we win we lose but at the end of the day....we must persevere on. 
Multiple jobs is the # I am about to hop on.
To those referencing this as it is gambling. 
I think a below comment said it well.
"know when to walk away"
its pretty easy to have a happy trigger finger when wanting to scalp but i have learned that patience in this market is key....no matter how high paced it may be. 
I hope you all got a kick out of my personal experience and I will be popping into this story periodically to keep you all informed on my current situation.  To those who read. Thanks for taking the time and equally for the feedback. I hope you all know that what is being shared by you all is almost exactly  the sentiment in my heart. BUT IT IS A LEARNING LESSON.    Check back that BTC address this time next month and we will see where we are

and i would agree with you but my strategy is not a set in stone thing like you might be under the impression of.....wake up y'all. MEX has even openly admitted to having an insider branch with access to different information than the masses. If i could afford to use high frequency trading algorithms, I would . You would have to be a bit dull in the mind to be under the impression that in this unregulated space people wouldn't find any way at all to maximize their BTC profit.
