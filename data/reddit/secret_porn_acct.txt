Oh please. I am calling you out on childish behavior, not saying your words are somehow physical in nature. But you knew that hence the reason for the strawman.

What is the point of name calling, OP? It is childish at best.

Er okay? Yes,I am on the internet and before that I ran a 6 node ringdown BBS.. What is your point? 
  
The only person who is acting like a snowflake is you. You can't stand the fact that someone called you out on your childish shit.   
Grow up.

It is Coinbase, the fact that it hasn't even broadcasted the transaction to the blockchain means it is on their end.   
  
My transaction just got broadcasted about 2 minutes ago so it seems like there is a 3 hour backlog on Coinbase right now.

I've been waiting 3 hours so far for them to even broadcast the fucking transaction.

That is just not true. The central bank, yes..   
Banks in general, no.  To understand why, you have to understand what a bank does, in a simplistic version it lends money to gain a profit. Where does it get this money? Customers that deposit money into the bank i.e. savings accounts, CDs, etc., hence why people receive interest if they put the money into different types of accounts.  
  
Lets not pretend that an industry such as banking, that we have known for thousands of years doesn't have a place  just because the currency has changed.

No. It is because it took almost an hour and 20 mins for a block to be generated. (And in that time smaller transactions may have had more fees or something so it built the block that way)

Are you talking about the end of 2013/beginning of 2014?  
That was a bubble and there was a correction...hence the reason why around Jan 2015 BTC/USD was around $400...  
  
   
All I am saying is don't get discouraged when the market corrects itself..if you look at the charts it is clear that it is a bubble...  
I would be happy to be wrong...but I really don't think I am

Now everyone, if.. well actually most-likely when this bubble pops don't get discouraged...it is the normal course of things.. this wasn't a gradual increase overtime..
