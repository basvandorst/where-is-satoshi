Perhaps the disconnect here is that your analogy is not new. It is frequently used by people like Jeremy Allaire, the CEO of Circle, a Bitcoin startup with massive funding. Others, like Mark Andreesen, the founder of Netscape and the biggest venture capital backer of Bitcoin, also makes this analogy very frequently. They compare Bitcoin to the Internet. All the time.
I have developed an intolerance to the analogy as it comes from people who made many millions of dollars on the Internet and are looking to do the same here, as older, more business savvy, connected boys who lost the starry eyed earnestness of the Internet pioneers with one too many trips to Sand Hill in Menlo Park.
Apologies for mistaking your simple analogy as a reference to a common link that is used by real dopes with real agendas. Please don't confuse me with them, and I will do the same.

In case you haven't noticed - Congress isn't so great at innovative ways of looking at existing problems. Obamacare is a
Good example. It is a huge structure of rules built atop the existing structure. It would have been amazing if it were on its own foundation, but there are too many monied interests in the existing Insurance system to truly reform it. Same goes for many other pieces of tangled legislation, especially in our tax laws.
For those hoping for a new asset class for crypto-currencies - there's really only one way that this could happen. Hint: it involves the time space continuum.

Either way I am curious what, specifically, these laws would look like in terms of protections for money laundering, income tax, sales tax, tax evasion, property tax, fraud protection, capital gains, estate tax, etc.

Much of my work in software is in managing engineering teams, a backlog of [user stories]( and the delivery of software releases. The Bitcoin Github project highlights three epics with many user stories expressed in C code: speed, trust, and anonymity. There are thousands of great use cases for speed and trust.

*It will be imperative that those systems adhere to anti money laundering statutes and know-your-customer controls*
So you're definitely going to be tying your identity to a Bitcoin address. How this works for paper wallets I can't fathom. So it's either exclusive to online wallets, or we get some kind of signature, tied to a verified online profile, for new addresses created offline. The latter requires an inconceivable change to the Bitcoin source code.
Based on the $ millions of institutional investment in Bitcoin - there are two possible conclusions to this screenplay. Either A) all transactions are conducted using online wallets like Coinbase, or B) we are going to be introduced to a new flavor of cryptocurrency, built by a foundation of monied interests and impotent figureheads. 
However the screenplay ends, the climax comes when a law is introduced that regulates crypto and requires your verified identity be tied to an address. To transition smoothly to the new law, we will be given a grace period on existing, unidentifiable addresses. During that grace period, you will either exchange your anonymous BTC for online wallets or this new kind of crypto. Perhaps there will be some fixed exchange rate, though this seems unlikely.
When the grace period ends, all addresses that are not validated are blacklisted by the official wallets.
I am betting on the new crypto since core committers will never let any of this happen.

Analyzing the blockchain won't help unless you can tie identities to addresses. If everyone is using Coinbase / online wallets then the government will be able to regulate things without a problem. If people keep their wallets offline, it is much easier to stay in the shadows, especially internationally.
If you keep your cash outside of a bank, never make a deposit (in the US at least) then you are right. But at some point, sometime, you might need to do business with someone who needs to make a large withdrawal. This triggers certain flags within the bank - unless it is done via a business with certain exemptions.
International transactions are much harder to pull off, obviously, using cash.
Bitcoin is awesome for staying hidden.

I am also a software guy with technical concerns. But those concerns are minimal compared to my concerns regarding the regulatory implications of crypto. I see no way for the anonymous nature of Bitcoins to be reconciled with know-your-customer and anti money laundering controls.
People talk about how non-anonymous Bitcoin is compared to cash, and that the blockchain can be analyzed for the point at which shady addresses intersect with addresses tied to a confirmed identity.
This argument doesn't hold up for me. Crypto is an online phenomena, and even if you find that intersection, the confirmed identity could be completely isolated from the criminal's identity.
Cash is more anonymous in some ways. But if you find someone that made a mistake - there is usually a direct link of personal relationships that lead to the criminal.
The reason I am not optimistic about Bitcoin is a mixture of technical and regulatory. Anonymity is built into the protocol. Until that changes, with certified online wallets tied to your confirmed profile, governments will view this endeavor as a haven for subversive behavior and tighten the clamp.

I think Allaire and Andreessen are motivated by success, which in their circles is completely measured by money. It is also the case that being involved with venture capital means signing up for a prodigious amount of pressure to create a financial windfall. That's the end goal.
Anyhow, I was part of a startup that banked on the Internet and won. This was circa 1996. I remember no doubts about the Internet's promise by that point. But earlier, of course, when I used spyglass for the first time, it was less about making a bet, and more about curiosity. There were things, though, to learn on the Internet.

If you want to do something shady in your neighborhood - you stay anonymous with cash.
If you want to do something shady online -you stay anonymous with Bitcoin.
You can analyze the blockchain to look for points at which a shady address transacted with a known address. But what do you do from there? You aren't in a neighborhood. The known identity never knocked on the shady person's door. The shady person drifted into the ether, turned their laptop off, and looked out the window at a beautiful mountain, desert, cityscape, forest, seashore, or horse pasture on the surface of planet earth.

I made a few hundred thousand dollars as part of an early Internet startup. Our executives made millions. I am in my late 40's. I remember the early Internet well.
The analogy is weak between early Internet and early Bitcoin. In early Internet, I could show my grandmother, now deceased, how to send a message to someone on another part of the planet. I could show her how to look at the USGS earthquake data immediately after feeling a tremor. I could put scanned images of my sister and I on a place where they were immediately available, instead of waiting for the mailman to arrive with copies from the photo printing store. My grandmother was amazed.
Now it is my mother's turn. She is the same age as my grandmother was, and I am the age she was when the Internet showed up.
Bitcoin has no immediate appeal to her. It is very difficult for her to understand the benefit it gives her, and there has yet to be an a-ha moment.
That's because Bitcoin has little advantage before it is widely adopted. The Internet had huge advantage, even in its infancy. My 88 year old grandmother was blown away. My mother? Just confused.

Bitcoin is not like the Internet.
The Internet socialized media somewhat, beginning as an academic medium, only to devolve into something bought and sold by large corporations interested in shaping what you believe to protect their commercial interests.
Bitcoin's biggest backers - venture capitalists, technophiles, and opportunistic investors, have no interest in socializing anything. They may claim as much, but it's disingenuous. We aren't in the early days of the Internet with Bitcoin. We have passed that period and are squarely in the land of greed.
The merit and benefit of the Internet's original intent persist today. Bitcoin never realized these merits. It went straight to the casino floor. And right to hell.

I am confused by your references to an options market. Can you explain where and how someone can short BTC? I am also confused by your statement that the "shorts" might dump BTC to drive the price down. This isn't how options markets work elsewhere as you wouldn't buy or sell stock to increase or decrease your options strike price. To do so would be a compounded bet against yourself.

No. It's not the same at all. The blockchain builds upon itself. You can't remove a block because it is deemed malicious or unsavory. That block must remain in the chain because it is part of the DNA of each subsequent block.
There are very few systems like that. Imgur is just a website. With files and a database and a decent search algorithm. Every image, comment, or user generated piece of anything is 100% disposable with zero impact on the integrity of the system underneath.

@_date: 2015-03-06 18:30:23
Our current global financial system, the way in which governments issue currency, set interest rates, create and pay debt, regulate industry, and legislate will never be undermined by any cryptocurrency without the consensus and approval of those responsible for that system.
Russia's corrupt band of organized criminal politicians, the United States and Europe's collection of plutocratic leaders living in the lined pockets of the wealthy - this stuff won't be reformed using software. Progress towards social and political democracy does not happen on reddit or on a linux command line. It happens in the streets - and it can be life threatening.
@_date: 2015-03-06 22:47:12
It absolutely is a new version of windows. The analogy of subversive groups and copyright pirates using the Internet is inadequate. If large financial institutions or G7 banks decide to shut down this entire thing they have immediate means of rendering crypto useless in the first world, which means it matters very little in subverting the power class. 
Stealing a hollywood movie or planning a protest / attack via email requires no direct collaboration from core state institutions.
In other words - local bitcoin, coinbase, bitpay, circle, are all OK with the commerce department. As soon as they aren't, Bitcoin is all but useless in threatening Corporate Imperialism.

You don't have to ban crypto. You ban the ability for first world citizens to convert it to dollars or euros. Since the power structure gives zero fucks about how the black market in the Congo buys and sells things, you have a better chance of subverting US and European financial systems using at least a hundred other disruptive and life threatening means.

The Federal Reserve Bank prints money. They are not, technically, part of the government and they have absolutely nothing to do with any law enforcement agencies. Historians will have nothing to say about any of this - because we will all be fighting over cans of dog food.

Please humor me by explaining how regulatory agencies in the first world could be stopped from building barriers to converting BTC to USD.
They already accomplished this in the realm of Internet gambling. Mere mortals living
in the United States are unwilling or unable to set up offshore VPN's in order to convert their direct deposited paychecks into exchangeable internet poker chips running in a datacenter in Bermuda.
As I said, in order to co-opt the current financial system - Bitcoin enthusiasts are asking for that same system's compliance. Those two things are wholly incompatible. Thus Bitcoin is relegated to a venture funded distributed Paypal that adheres to the same sorts of regulation, central control, and corporate cronyism that we already live with in fiat currency.
The two groups behind BTC are out of balance. One side - the pump and dump opportunists needs the other - the rebellious arm chair philosophers. But there is only one of those two that will ultimately benefit - and their windfall will look a hell of a lot like the 1% fat-and-happy jerks the armchair philosophers wanted to bring down in the first place.

This pool of entrepreneur respondents view BTC as a speculative financial investment as much or more than they believe BTC is a currency. Predicting a drop in BTC would be an acknowledgement that other speculators should be wary. Since the nature of BTC as a speculative endeavor is predicated on convincing more and more speculators that the price will increase, it is no surprise that exactly zero of the respondents answered otherwise.
You would get better data by asking this subreddit, since many of us are here to watch on the sidelines, but have no less expertise than those with skin in the game.

It's a long standing debate that I am not interested in winning or losing. My point was about lumping US law enforcement into a bucket of agencies ("they") that can print money.
I think Putin's Russia may be a more apt model of government in which printing money and enforcing law are directly connected.

In other words, you absolutely can share these views, as most people do, but doing so is hypocrisy.
@_date: 2015-03-07 05:26:25
Congress passed laws in both 2000 and 2005 that killed online gambling in the US. The FBI began seizing websites of extremely profitable companies. Collectively, these companies were making money into the billions. There are publicly reported revenue and profit statements in the hundreds of millions from PartyGaming, PartyPoker, FullTilt... etc.
Why? Not because the elected officials have morals. To the contrary, it is because politicians are whores. Online casinos started encroaching on real casinos, which had much more political influence, a strong lobby, and directly impact state and municipal tax revenues. Caesar's makes $100m every single day. They weren't going to let this go on very long, no matter what the fallout from investors and owners.
Speaking of whores, our elected officials are perfectly willing and able to stop Bitcoin in its tracks, but they have no reason to. Why? Because it is a speculative opportunity for get-rich-quick venture capitalists and the chosen few they fund. There is nothing threatening about that. In fact, they might make a few bucks themselves along the way.
There are, most definitely, two opposing ways of thinking about Bitcoin. This has nothing to do with the schizophrenia of the community. It is more about the hypocritical nature of that schizophrenic community attempting to reconcile these opposing views. One side views Bitcoin as a tool of democracy - a means of empowering people to conduct transactions without the involvement of the state. The other side views Bitcoin as an investment like real estate or a stock trade.
You cannot share these two views. If you do, you are rooting against yourself. That is my fundamental point. Contrary to your argument that the financial system is not monolithic - it is very much controlled by a very small number of individuals who have crafted a handful multilateral agreements on investment (MAI), as well as enforcement policies, voted into law by every member country of the World Trade Organization and G7. This is a monolithic system of global governance with teeth. That's why countries get fined in the millions or billions for passing laws that protect the environment and workers, and it's why we live in a global system of increased inequality and avarice.
So, you see, by rooting for the venture capitalists, you root against subverting the very thing that distances them from worrying about putting dinner on the table or paying their rent. Our contemporary banking system.
You can't be on both sides of this equation - even if the community believes it can be.

I don't think the world is going to end. I think it is going to continue towards market instability, war, and fragile unresilient infrastructure ruled by tyrants and plutocrats. Bitcoin has no bearing on any of that. It's a speculative opportunity for short term gain by financiers, entrepreneurial risk takers, and bamboozled dreamers who gravitate towards ideas that provide a paper thin feeling of superiority.
@_date: 2015-02-25 05:59:53
Well that sort encompasses the paradox doesn't it. We need things like Coinbase and Circle to push towards wider adoption. But that kills it as a subversive currency. Yet if you don't have Coinbase or Circle then the government will treat it like piracy or worse.
Quite a pickle.

I am not saying individuals cannot possess the viewpoint. I am saying that there is a healthy dose of contradiction for those who do.

Right. It's another layer to the story. Bitcoin was created as a transactive technology with inherent trust, safety and integrity. That's quite different than idealistically believing it would offer salvation for centrally controlled currency market exchanges.

Disclaimer - not long on Bitcoin as currency. Rather short on Bitcoin as speculative endeavor.
The founder of Circle is a friend of mine from his first startup. His name is Jeremy Allaire. I ran West Coast sales for him at a company named after him and his brother in the mid 1990's. We sold one of the first application servers - before Microsoft had IIS, and before Java launched. He is tightly knit with General Catalyst, the VC that funded them, since David Orfao was Allaire's CEO.
So enough about my personal relationship with Circle. What about the idea? I honestly feel like the whole thing is an opportunists wet dream, and I am jealous that Jeremy has the means and connections to put something like this together. Circle will either be recognized for its part in changing international currency exchange, or it will be recognized as part of the familiar narrative of irrational exuberance. Either way, Jeremy's wealth, and the wealth of those involved, will surge upwards. I see few ways of fucking this one up, even if Bitcoins are taxed like cigarettes and whiskey by 2015.
Oh. The idea. Sure. Another Coinbase with less friction. Yes. Good.

The existing elite is pouring money into Bitcoin. As a speculative enterprise. Which undermines it's chances to become anything other than that. Were it truly an alternative currency, regulations would (will) be enacted in an unpleasantly neutering fashion. Military? I don't see it. People are not going to take up arms over Bitcoin. More likely people will take up arms over abortion, immigration, etc.

Bitcoin subreddit reminds me a bit of a website called Silicon Investor circa 1990's. SI was a one stop shop for rumors, unworthy promotion, unbridled group think, contention, and turmoil. All of which had impact on real dollars.
I'd put this post in the category of unworthy promotion. The OP is earnest enough, but the only reason it landed on the front page is because high tech folk, ie - the Reddit editorial staff, are more likely to have a personal interest in it.
Silicon Investor was where the Chips and Technologies scandal really played itself out. The stock went from single dollars into the stratosphere, making a lot of people quite wealthy, only to be uncovered as fraudulent.
Tip for OP - I agree that accepting Bitcoin will help you in terms of publicity. Once that dies down - if you want to accept credit cards - look at Stripe.

Some of the comments here in this thread have reminded me that Bitcoin is just a way of trusting an exchange - nothing more. It's TCP.
The application of meaning - this is different. Was part of the fantasy about saving us from tyranny? I think this is one of the things that people applied to it. And I think it's what the financiers hold onto and repeat in order to ground the idea in hope and idealism, rather than avarice.
I don't agree with you, though, about greed being endemic in financial transactions, but I will save that for a philosophy class.

I guess the point is not about my obsession with the price. The point is that I am more interested in the price than the idea of using the currency to purchase things. Which means I am not treating this thing as a currency at all - but as a scheme to make a quick buck. Thus, while I am now a card carrying Bitcoin owner, my beliefs are not at all in harmony with the people proclaiming that this is an alternative means for conducting commerce. My bet is that I am the majority.
@_date: 2013-12-22 17:53:02
Which part do you find confusing? In plain English I will say it like this:
I am nolonger interested in the idea of buying and selling with Bitcoin. I am interested in a short term profit based on its exchange rate with USD. I believe this is what motivates most of the mainstream at this point in time, and this is what puts the original intent of Bitcoin at risk. Popularity for selfish gain subverts the notion of Bitcoin as an alternative currency.
@_date: 2013-12-23 02:08:28
Humor me. Getting rich means volatility. A sharp rise means no buyers using it as currency. A sharp decline means no sellers.
You want to use Bitcoins to buy a kitten. Today, that kitten is $400 USD (it's a pure bred Persian). This equals .8 BTC. Tomorrow the kitten is still $400 USD but because Bitcoins are all the rage, the price is now .6 BTC. Do you buy the cat today in BTC knowing that tomorrow it might be .4 BTC? No, you hold onto the BTC and use dollars, because it's losing its value quickly in comparison, and isn't as valuable. You are holding onto it. You're not using it as currency.
Then you have the other side. The seller offers the kitten at $400 USD / .8 BTC but now the rage is over and the prices are dropping like stones. The seller would much rather take dollars, because he knows that tomorrow the BTC is going to be worth less than it is today.
So I repeat. How can you view Bitcoins as a way to get rich while considering it a currency? If your response is "I don't care if the price rises sharply, I will continue to use it every day because I believe that furthering Bitcoins as a currency is more important than short term gain," then I will graciously strike your words about getting rich from the record.
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:14:36
I think we are saying something different. I see, for now, that the power structure, which includes both government and finance, are interested in allowing Bitcoin to operate as usual, likely because there are individuals within those institutions looking to make short term gains. The founders of Netscape and Facebook represent the dreams of wealth and opportunity for those who are already entitled. It's the status quo.
Bitcoin is not the subversive force that so many crave it to be. An alternative digital currency may be able to learn from this timeline and adjust it for common use, but I am afraid this form of trustful exchange has too much entanglement with the very things it was hoping to disrupt.
@_date: 2013-12-23 01:46:23
