Ikr, fuck me for taking gains and buying a house. If only I had held cash instead I could have bought more!
This crash is just a winter sale.

Probably one of the dumbest comments ever posted.

As far as I can tell, yes.

I sold close to 300 bitcoin on localbitcoins so I could buy an expensive stereo system for my car. I don't even own that car anymore.
I feel you bro.

On that echo chamber? If it was mods got rid of it.
Neither community really wants the other side spewing its filth onto their boards.
Ours is better anyway, r/btc is obsessed with us.

Mine were incredibly easy to use and worked no problems.
I hold a few ERC20 tokens, Vertcoin, Bitcoin, and Litecoin all on my Ledger.

Thanks for this

Ledger supports myetherwallet.com wallets, you simply plug the Ledger in, under Ethereum you enable Browser Support and the other option(can't remember what it's called.)
Then once you create the wallet you simply move the tokens.

Yes, the only thing that may confuse someone is selecting options when it comes to chains like BitCoin compared to Bitcoin Cash or  Vertcoin compared to Vertcoin SegWit..
Took some mind gymnastics to transfer my tokens on MEW to a different MEW wallet for the Ledger but nothing impossible.

When the "split" originally happened, way before the fork actually happened, I was sub'd to both BTC and Bitcoin subreddits.
I wanted to be able to hear both sides of the argument. I had to unsub from r/btc because most posts were smear campaigns toward bitcoin and reeked of narcissism.

Last time bitcoin topped out Silkroad was also at the forefront of the news and we all know how many coins were flowing through darknet markets like it at the time. 
Just a thought. I'm still buying coins.

I sold 6 when they were worth 200 and bought a nice stereo system for a car I don't even have anymore.
Nothing like hind sight....

What happens if you accidentally cut your finger off?
@_date: 2016-12-29 17:35:01
Lol I love that sub.
