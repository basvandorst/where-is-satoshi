Towards the goal of bitcoin becoming money, an important step could be for brokerages like Fidelity and Schwab to become bitcoin exchanges as a service to their customers.
That would offer several advantages over current exchanges:
1. They are intensely security conscious and would take major steps to ensure that they would not get hacked.
2. They are already adept at legal compliance.
3. They already have a responsive help desk infrastructure and staff that could be trained about bitcoin.
If others agree, we could ask any brokerage with whom we have a relationship to tell us their development plans around bitcoin.
What do you think?

With all due respect, none of them. 
- And with all due respect back to you - thanks for engaging in this conversation ...
Bitcoin is a decentralized system, people should stop trying to find a "leader" or "representative".  
- All systems have leaders, titled as such or not.
Even if Core developers and BU people agreed on something, they don't have to power to unilaterally implement it. 
- There are many sources and forms of power, including the power gained by reputation, knowledge, history, respect, and influence.  If 3 developers for whom you have great respect recommend something, you are going to at least consider it.
That power in bitcoin (and all cryptocurrencies) is with the economic majority expressing it's wish through using full nodes as wallets. That's not my opinion, that's how bitcoin works on a technical level. 
- Yes, but development also influences the economic majority and what the majority uses.
What's probably going to happen is after the current bip9 period of segwit ends, the bitcoin economy may choose to do a user-activated-soft-fork that activates segwit, which is not subject to a veto by the miners.  
- Yes, this may turn out to be a path forward, and right now, I am asking a question about what we might do before next November.

In the 1960's, I used to play (and lose) chess with chess masters at my school.  Once in a while they would crown my move with the comment, "best", meaning, given my choices, I had, in their estimate, selected the best move.
Bitcoin is not a game of chess with its win-lose character.  We need solutions that allow the most people to "win" at the lowest risk and possible cost.
Technical parameters exist within a political framework, whether we want to admit it or not.  Given the political climate, the criteria should be "workable", not "the right value" aka "best". There is more than one possible solution to workable which could, with compromise, allow Segwit to move forward.

Yes, we are currently at a political deadlock.  Core says that Segwit is already a compromise in its effect upon blocksize.  This compromise seems to be suffering the fate of many other unilateral compromises.  Clearly it has not been accepted and endorsed by most BU advocates.
Bitcoin needs a bilateral compromise, but I don't see people on either side willing to sit down with each other to work one out.  Both sides have stories that demonize the others and justify their own current intransigent position.

Please allow me to push a little.  There seem to be many more than 2 pure points of view.  We may be able to find a strategy that satisfies many people on both sides.
I venture that 99% of people do not want a solution that is not technically sound.  Both sides have expressed feeling coerced, bullied, not listened to, not appreciated, etc. Please forgive me if this idea is dumb, but I think a developer has already said that it is possible.
How about incorporating a 2mb block plus Segwit into a soft fork?  Can new 2mb blocks can be compatible with existing 1mb blocks?  If it can be done and most people, on both sides, see it as a step forward, we can fight about even bigger blocks in the future, after we see the effect of the soft fork. 
Again, I am appealing to 99% of the people who will read this who I consider to be of fundamentally good faith about wanting Bitcoin to have a great future.

@_date: 2017-02-16 19:43:35
I appreciate your perspective - and respectfully disagree.  There is no "point of no return" unless Bitcoin is dead.  BU people see a mirror image.  They believe that Core has central control and BU hopes to liberate Bitcoin.
A compromise is not "by definition worse" as long as it provides a viable path. "Workable" should be the goal, not "optimal" since both sides define optimal differently.
Bitcoin has a governance problem.  I credit Core with Bitcoin's current success, but governance by who controls the code can't work in the long run.
BU has not suggested a governance model or even negotiation and compromise - which makes them susceptible to the charge, "you want to install your own dictatorship".
Core refusing negotiation and compromise fuels the flames of rebellion.  If I was a miner, I would probably not signal, hoping that the factions find a way to a common path.  Negotiation and compromise - best for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-14 16:48:04
I agree, and guess the BU proponents might say the same thing.  I have heard some people say that they are in favor of both.  Allowing the possibility of a dual signal would tell us something about the distribution of sentiment.
Do you have some ideas about how to conduct diplomacy?  I'd like to hear them and would hope I could help in some way.
@_date: 2017-02-16 22:09:52
BashCo, I am glad for and very appreciative of Core devs efforts.  I consider them the reason that Bitcoin is currently safe and stable.  If I had the ability to convince them, I would love to see miners send Segwit signalling to 99%.
But BU seems to have politically stalemated Segwit. BU too claims to want Bitcoin to succeed. On r/btc, BU people (Tanksablazment) say about a HF that "it will only happen with a great majority of the network". I am assuming, (without evidence), that means &gt;90%.
If that is the case, then we are in a stalemate that could last a long time. I don't fear Bitcoin's failure because it continues to grow as a network of value. I do regret the lost time and opportunity towards fixing problems, increasing throughput, laying the groundwork for Lightning, and keeping fees reasonable.  
This kind of standoff is not historically unique. We cannot know if a negotiated solution is possible unless we try.  The attempt, even if it fails, would be informative.

@_date: 2017-02-11 17:10:42
Thank you for your response.  As you know, Core has a mirror image, reversed reality version of yours.  Unfortunately, for now, being "right" has trumped trying again. 
Failing 20 times does not justify not trying the 21st time. "0 desire" gets 0.  Any compromise in history has been the product of "trying again", even when both sides have "proof" that the other can't be trusted. 
So I ask you again, as an honorable individual who cares about the future of Bitcoin, would Segwit plus 2mb blocks on a soft fork garner your support? If not that, then, given the current impasse, and understanding that a hard fork is a non-starter, then what?

Forgive me for grasping at straws, but with enough straws, we could have a raft.  I remember a Core developer, don't remember who, saying that he thought that Segwit + 2mg blocks could be done in a soft fork.  So, there would be less waiting for that.
The Bitcoin ecosystem and related technology have been changing so fast that formerly held views might change based upon new possibilities. Segwit +2 could give us much new information, including future blocksize needs.
Some have argued a "survival of the fittest" form of Social Darwinism for Bitcoin, but species and civilizations have vanished due to misjudgments. Why put Bitcoin to an unnecessary test in which both contestants could perish?

Both sides claim that they are avoiding political coercion. This is another way of saying that both sides are seeking political power over the other.

I think that I understand the difference between an SF and a HF.  Am I correct in thinking that the difference in the effect of forking due to incompatible versions lessens as the % of miners signalling for a particular implementation increases?  IE, 95% signalled adoption is safer than 75% is safer than 55%?
If this is the case, then consensus matters a lot, maybe more than whether the fork is H or S?  I do understand that a SF must work with existing nodes of earlier code versions while a HF potentially leaves them stranded.
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:13:13
Core thinks they have already compromised with a capacity increase in Segwit.  Hard vs soft fork choice is binary. I have suggested an additional block size increase in Segwit, but then realized that I have no evidence that anyone in the BU camp is interested in that.
In family therapy, I would ask each party what they request from the other, and get each to respond to the other's request.  A size increase in Segwit might be negotiable. Type of fork seems not.  I don't want to see a hard fork.
If some supporters of BU can support a Segwit softfork with modification, they should make their request. Likewise with Core, but hardfork seems like a non-starter.
In couples therapy, the question after discovering an irreconcilable difference, is "can we have an amicable separation?"  Are we there or can any BU supporters support Segwit with modifications on a soft fork? 
@_date: 2017-02-11 20:50:11
Yes, I've eaten my share of worms also, and I would point out that Core, like BU, is composed of many individuals with a wide range of cares and viewpoints. We do a disservice to both groups and possible futures for Bitcoin every time we treat either of them as a monolith. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 19:05:03
hmmm, I posted this more than 2 hours ago and it still has not appeared.  I wonder if it will appear here?
There is a significant possibility that neither Segwit nor BU will activate for a long time.
Given what we all think possible for Bitcoin, that would be sad. And, perhaps naively, I still believe that if we can allow our imaginations to go out 3 or 4 years, both sides actually want the same outcome.
Both claim to be champions of decentralization and a trustless Bitcoin. Both also, I think, make unjustifiable claims to blockade the other. Some people in Core seem to claim that "code is king" and the "best technical solution" is the only solution. BU claims to be heirs to SN and to be a liberation movement (my phrase) from the dictatorial Core.
The best technical solution is not best if it cannot activate. And one group's liberation is the other's enslavement. While I know that there are (some?) in Core who consider non action to be OK, because Bitcoin will continue to grow as a value network, I don't think there is anyone (I could be wrong) who does not want both a value network AND a transactional powerhouse, possibly off chain, in 4 years (yes, I made up that timeframe).
If I am correct, then the main impediment to Bitcoin progress is not technical, but, as others have asserted, political. What, when, and how are relative details that have been promoted to justifications. Both camps need to compare the cost of no progress to the cost of compromise.
Thanks for listening.
@_date: 2017-02-11 20:44:52
Thanks, I know that.  What I am curious about is whether those calling for even bigger blocks would be happy if they got Segwit plus a base 2mg block in a soft fork.  
If Core offered Segwit+ and if even half of the miners signalling for BU would be happy with it and would signal for it, it could be a step towards consensus.  
I know it's a lot of "ifs" and I would not expect Core to even consider offering it unless they had a clear indication that a significant number of miners would be interested in it.
And I do understand that at this time ~50% of the miners are not signalling anything which could mean any of several things including, no changes now.
I also notice that there are many interpretations of what non-signalling could mean.  Too bad there is not more direct communication between them and Dev.
Question for Dev:  Can a miner signal for 2 possible forks, thereby indicating acceptance of whichever gets the highest total?  Like graduated voting instead of only a binary choice?

Others can answer this question better than I, but I think that nodes are the foundation of Bitcoin.  Each (full) node contains the complete Bitcoin blockchain and can be used to validate transactions.  If a transaction does not match what is already on my node, my node will reject it.
It is this distributed nature of the Bitcoin blockchain that guarantees data integrity and Bitcoin value.

You could be right, but one way to find out is to get people to talk with one another, including listening and considering compromises that do not violate fundamental principles.

Diana, conversation takes place here because it's a good forum.  You can't have it 3 ways.  You accuse the subreddit of centralization and harsh censorship but the sub seems to work for many people. Do you wonder why?
@_date: 2017-02-26 15:46:58
I have had comments "censored" because I tripped one of the key words that causes a comment to be held until a moderator can review it.
When one of your comments does not appear, you can assume that is what happened.  You can then ask a mod why.  Since mods are not paid employees, it sometimes takes a while until a mod sees it.
It would be interesting if the mods had the time and energy to post truly censored comments and the reason why, maybe for one day.
I suspect that what we would see is that the sub is spared a lot of stuff that would make it a less useful sub if we all had to wade through it.
Again, ask yourself why this is the more popular sub.  You can't separate the answer from the moderation.

The war of attrition is already occurring. Implementation of improvements has been frozen for how long? 
Every person reading this can imagine a compromise that would work.  And everyone can imagine fork outcomes that do not.  
Hodlers would get some of both coins but the combined total could be far lower than their investment in the current coin.  
Yes, it is hard to get into and get out of Bitcoin, but those who found a way in can find a way out.  It is only a tiny minority who may be "excited about having a say" post fork.  
I would be excited about a compromise solution and no hard fork.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:10:33


This could sound like one way communication.  The communication that is needed consists of listening to the concerns of others and negotiating workable compromises as possible which allow implementation to proceed safely and steadily.

The battle of the hegemons, great, like a bad cartoon. I second the negotiate sentiment. The whole Bitcoin ecosystem is suffering from this fight, as reflected in current block size, transaction cost, and price.  BU people say of negotiating, "we already tried that", or "it's too late for that." Core people say, "you can't negotiate about what is technically the best." Both positions are immature and shown to be false by successful negotiations that have occurred between historic opponents. Consider Northern Ireland for only one example.
While I'm on my soap box, I want to point out that the all time worst argument against Segwit,  is "Segwit is not about blocksize,that was an afterthought" and "it's too little, too late."  Imagine a starving family, offered half a loaf of bread, responding with "It's too little, too late".  The parents would be arrested for child abuse.

Thanks for your thoughtful response, u/Kretchino  - some more of my thoughts:
**Superior Technology**: I agree that superior technology doesn't always prevail (cf: Microsoft Windows). But in the case of bitcoin, anything but the best could cost us $20B!
*Technology does not have to be perfect, it has to be adequate.  Core Devs, and those monitoring any agreement, would not accept any code that has not been held to Core's high standards. $20B only exists through the confidence of investors and users.*
*Room for negotiation exists without sacrificing quality.  For example, an agreement might including some variation of the following: "6 (N) months after Segwit activation, the Blocksize Evaluation Group, including Devs and Miners with input from users, would make an assessment of block usage and fees and issue a recommendation about a possible block size increase by hard fork, not to be activated without at least 97% (M) acceptance."*  
**Politics**: I agree that the technological differences between Segwit and BU have been exposed more than enough and the actual situation is all about a political takeover of bitcoin in the most dangerous way: Hardforking with bugged software that could cost us $20B!
*Hard forking could cost Bitcoin dearly, especially with Roger Ver recently saying that the possible decision point could occur at 60% BU signaling.  The way to avert this, IMHO, is to negotiate an alternative path that is acceptable to the overwhelming majority of the committed Bitcoin community. If BU people will not negotiate, then the public onus would be on them.*
**Leadership**: The only leadership needed is in the hands of the devs that have a commit access to the github repository. Anybody who wants to contribute must submit his code to one of these devs and join in his "chain of trust". That's how open-source projects work (cf: Linus Torvalds and the Linux project). Running code that hasn't been properly reviewed and allowing anyone to commit changes to the project could cost us $20B!
*You may be right or you may be wrong.  Bitcoin's current path could put your assertion to the test, risking $20B. Yes, all code MUST be reviewed and subject to the current commit process.  But the decision about the best path for Bitcoin should be made more transparent, open, and fair.  When, how, and why to increase block size should not be the domain of just a few developers.*
*Some, I don't know how much of the current BU base of support comes from those who feel excluded from the process but are committed to Bitcoin's success. Offer them a way in -  other than, submit your code and it will be accepted or rejected by a process that nobody understands, under the leadership of people who deny their own influence.*
If you still have any doubts listen to what other experts, who are on neither side have to say, like Andreas Antonopoulos or Charlie Lee. They are other bitcoin implementations that don't cause any problems such as Bcoin so the problem doesn't lie with Core.
*The problem may not lie with Core, but the solution may. Hey Andreas, help me out here! Am I totally off base? Charlie, do you consider BU Miners and those who don't signal to be a lost cause, or could you use help in talking with them? If either, or both of you tell me to do so, I will STFU.*
Talking to the miners is also a waste of time, they know their business and are running it in their best interest. Charlie Lee tried with no luck. Also I don't see how you can pull 3 names from a list and call them leaders; they will never be considered as legit and will be subject to corruption. Bitcoin is about decentralization and that's the way it's got to be for it to work.
*They will be considered legit, they will not be subject to corruption, and every decision will be reviewed and implemented or not only after the "vote" of the rest of the Devs. 100+ developers cannot be at the meeting.  It is just too many to reach a negotiated settlement.  Decentralization is about process, not direction.  And it is a myth to deny that there are Core leaders.*
Bitcoin is doing just fine and won't change if it doesn't have to. Maybe after the next halving if the block rewards can't cover electricity expense... As for the social media trolls, there is little that can be done, but isn't that what social medias are all about?
*Bitcoin could be doing better.  The current political impasse is worrying to many and undermines its value.  An attempt at a BU hard fork could be damaging, and, given all the variables, I am not sure that the outcome is certain.  Are you?  $20B sure?*

There was a group advocating this, but they seem to have gone dormant.  Yes, voting would have to be verifiable and anonymous. Seemingly a contradiction.
The Aadhaar system in India validates identity by both demographic and biological markers.  It was invented to prevent welfare fraud, but has had broader positive results, including access to banking and credit.  It  could help everyone to know that a person is real and unique, even if it did not reveal identity.
A problem with Aadhaar is that it is government controlled. Even if that control is benevolent and trustworthy today, there is no guarantee that it will remain so in the future. It seems like the right to have an identity, to be a unique person, may be more fundamental than our other rights, as shown by how successful Republicans have been in voter suppression based upon doubtful challenges to individual's identity.
So there is the challenge.  Can block-chain technology be helpful in establishing and maintaining a unique identity for all, independent of governments and corporations, while at the same time, giving individuals control over who can see what part of their actions and identity.

You have it exactly wrong.  The current price drop is 100% attributable to the threat of a hard fork. I know because I sold some coin today, and so did many other people.  The longer we, customers of Bitcoin, feel threatened by a hard fork, the further the price will drop.  You can bank on it.

Question to Core devs, out of my own curiosity:  Would any of you support a 0.4 (or N) MB pre-Segwit hardfork capacity increase coded and reviewed in the Github repository, (IFF) If and Only If 97% (or M) miner support could be gained for the HF? 
There would have to be a written agreement of same Miners that it would be followed by Segwit activation within 3 (or O) months?
I am not asking if this is the optimum chain of events.  Rather, I am asking if this is a workable path, assuming the politics could be made amenable.

Where is your evidence for this? That prediction is similar to the prediction that Bitcoin will fail or be overtaken.  
Here's a different prediction: It will continue to grow as a store of value, and would grow even more, including as a vehicle for low cost transactions, if the technology is allowed to advance. 
Segwit is ready to go. Its implementation will reveal if larger blocks are needed above and beyond that.  I still don't understand the opposition to it.

I did not say "successful".  The threat of a fork is, and a non-successful fork would be destructive to Bitcoin.

If the risk was 0% things would look different.

Almost everyone on this sub wants to see Segwit implemented. So this conversation has a "preaching to the choir" aspect.
Who is talking to the almost 75% of the miners who are not signalling Segwit?  What are the plans to do so?  
Who is posting on the other sub in a calm and constructive manner in the hopes of winning some of them over?
Who among the leadership of Core would negotiate with the leadership of BU?

I find it interesting that no response to op's question quotes a miner or cites an organization of miners.  Reddit in general and this sub also is full of speculation about other people's thoughts and motivations.
How about some real data?  Who on this sub knows a miner?  Is there a miner's organization?  How about some real dialogue instead of speculation and conjecture?
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:16:11
I want to be sure that I understand what you are proposing.  Are you proposing that Core joins the BU hard-fork, suggest that Segwit signalling miners switch to signalling BU, and that Core devs develop on top of the BU code base (which I understand is 98% Core code)?
This strategy would allow Core and supporters to "fight another day", albeit in a world of increased miner centralization and Pay Pal tendencies.
My non-technical view is that the Miners supporting the BU fork are mainly about preserving their own income.  After the fork, they may not even increase block-size, or increase it very little, once they actually assess what they would lose in fees.  Big blockers could end up quite disappointed.
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:50:38
A constrained definition of politics yields a crippled future.  The real distribution of power changes constantly.  The BTC community needs to govern itself rather than accept hidden hands.  Miner signalling illustrates real time shifts in power, for example.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:57:36
How about a political compromise that is technically safe?  Can a 2mb size increase be added via a soft fork - in addition to the addition contained in Segwit  - maybe together or maybe within 2 months given certain agreed upon conditions - signed in blood?  Please explain.

You can't assume that downvotes are by Core advocates, and the question about who is afraid of dialogue cannot be answered by votes.
I have been advocating negotiation for a while, and have never been upvoted on either sub.  Having said that, I would like to point out that the threat of a hard fork raises the urgency of the situation. (Roger has said that he would consider forking at 60%).
Users and hodlers need to develop some form of power to force those in both camps to negotiate.  But the threat of a hard fork must cease!

Why do you say that it is off the table?  Its adherents still say that they plan to do it.  Even if there is only a 20% chance that they will fork, that is still a significant risk for investors.

A good analogy is the US Constitution.  It distributes power in government but that distribution is constantly in flux, as illustrated by our current situation.  The genesis block, like the Constitution, could not possibly foresee every change in relationships, interests, and power.  It is a framework, within which real struggles for power and control still occur.  Jihan and a hard fork, whatever his motives, represents, IMHO, a real threat to Bitcoin value and stability.  The current response may be inadequate.

Safety and backward compatibility make sense to me as things to be highly valued and protected.
I also understand why we do not want a central authority to control voting privs.  I know that I may be off in blue sky, but can / have you or others imagined a way to grant privs algorithmically, based upon how much the user is willing to reveal to a well encrypted data store that is capable of checking claims and references and is accessible only to a few arbiters who perhaps do not even know each other’s identity and who perhaps rotate every N days? Or maybe, like current transactions, an identity claim cannot be validated until M other users or miners have agreed?
My interest in this is related to my interest in a system of global democracy that can both verify and protect identity.   Yes, I see some of the problems of coin voting, including a new 1%, just like the old 1%.  I need to look up Arrow’s theorem, thanks. No, I do not think that voting is a reasonable way to do system engineering.  However, if there is a way to vote that most people think fair, it might be a reasonable way to influence future features and scheduling. Are miners dissatisfied? (is there a way that they are polled to express themselves?)
Also, isn’t there a conundrum contained in the fact that developers are not paid?  I can see where the existing Core group may be motivated by the value of their own coins, in addition to their belief in the value of Bitcoin to the world.  But how do new developers join in, who may have no coin, but have a passion for the project?
And I understand (a little) that the source code is the implementation, and maybe that response will suffice for decades.  Will it?  Like the US Constitution, will it get old?  Do you think that the current block size controversy is more than a tempest in a teapot.  Does Bitcoin lose by their dissatisfaction?

kanzure, thank you for responding to my post.  Internal governance need not make hostile outside political intervention easier if there is a way for people to have rights without exposing their identities.  Insurgent organizations operating under threats of death in fascistic countries often appoint spokespersons who are understood to be without power and who live in relatively safer locations.  
I see the existing system for voting your coins. That is an interesting since miners, developers, and investors all have coins. Why do you think it has not been used more widely? However, as more big institutions and governments own and control Bitcoin it also has the vulnerability of control by them.  Given the potential future reach of Bitcoin, 1 BTC = 1 vote reproduces the political nightmare of guaranteeing the power of the same 1% who control the world today.
Consensus is an interesting concept.  Today we hear the “buyer’s remorse” of some Brexit voters as commentators point out that &gt; 50% was a poor metric to use for so important a decision.  If Bitcoin had a constitution, it might stipulate what level of agreement is necessary for what kind of decision. Algorithmic consensus still leaves open the question, at what level should the algorithm be fulfilled.
If some years from now Bitcoin became the dominant world currency, would we be willing to submit to some form of democracy?

I am 71 years old,  new to Bitcoin, see its potential,  and have invested an important amount of our savings in it.  Prior to retirement, I worked in software development organizations for 19 years and then was a family and school therapist for 12.  I was never a programer but worked closely with all the people who specify, design, create, test, document, manage, market, and sell software products.   
Listening to this conversation, I have only limited understanding of the technical issues.  I have great admiration for everyone who has brought Bitcoin to its current level of design, code, process, mining, market cap, and vision.  While Bitcoin does not seem in any imminent danger of collapse, in the conversations in this forum I hear the frustration many in the community feel with others around important issues, which engenders alienation, splits, wasted energy, and suboptimum product. 
Problems that I see in the conversation:
Disagreements about facts in the importance of particular facts
No way to ascertain internal opinion because we can’t poll the “membership”
No identification of membership, by function or importance to the project
No way to protect identity while also identifying salient contribution, ownership, etc
I understand that these are not simple problems.  In the early 1970’s I self-identified for several months as a communist and have remained on the left.  I am friends with libertarians, anarchists, liberals, conservatives, and, unfortunately, a few further to the right.  I recognize in this discussion many of the concerns that center on power, centralization, and authority. 
Nonetheless, Bitcoin needs some form of self-governance, and I would like to try to list some of the questions that would need to be answered:
How would we divide the broad interest groups, understanding that there is great overlap, for purposes of discussion and voting? 
Should some groups have special rights, particularly within their own domains?
How would we solve the problem of owners not wanting to be identified with their holdings?
How could we protect identity, in general, while still giving deserved status and rights? (some of these questions are important beyond Bitcoin)
Is there a way to use some of the technical achievements within and beyond Bitcoin to create a system of self-governance that protects identity and allows for governability? (for example, miners could vouch for miners, developers for developers, owners for owners in a Bitcoin specific identity system).
I don’t think that the current system of governance is viable long term.  There is too much frustration, feelings of disrespect and being disrespected, and assertions of power and powerlessness.  The Bitcoin community has brought Bitcoin to the threshold of changing economies.  Can it take the next steps to govern itself in a fair and transparent manner?
Just as Bitcoin allows for the disintermediation of money, can we imagine a way to create a governance system that protects privacy, respects all participants and allows for explicit decisions that are clear and accepted, even by those who disagree? (I understand that there is already a system for implicit decisions in the code creation / fork process)

Have you given up?  For me, at 71 years old, I am saddened by the snarkiness, scorn, and sarcasm expressed in all of Reddit, not just Bitcoin related forums.  
I worked in corporations and then as a therapist for many years, and view civil conversation to be a skill, especially including the ability to tolerate and listen closely to people with whom you disagree.  Most of us are not born with it.  And, as many of others have observed, the Internet can enhance alienation due to the lack of fact-to-face.
IMHO, the future of Bitcoin depends on most "sides" cultivating the skill, especially in light of the requirement for consensus in process of the soft fork. It's not too late ... until it is.

The problem with an ETF is a problem which already exists for the stock GBTC.  Investors are paying the operating costs including the salaries of the executives.  I have tracked the price of GBTC compared to the price of Bitcoin and GBTC price has degenerated over time.  You are better off buying Bitcoin itself and not some stock, ETF, or other derivative.

in the article: “If there were a significant number of users and transaction processors (‘miners’) on the network that elected to choose an alternative version of the Bitcoin software, [then] the Bitcoin network could fork and potentially result in two different blockchains. This could have a significant adverse effect on the price, perception, and usage of Bitcoin.”

As I understand it, you do not owe any taxes on bitcoin that you bought and still hold, no matter how you bought them, including through an exchange.
However, if you exchange them for $$ or buy things with them, tax is owed based upon value received.  For example, if you paid $10K for Bitcoin that are now worth $30K, and you buy a $30K car with them, you owe taxes on the $20K profit.
Is this how others understand it?

Thanks for your reply.  Opposition to SegWit makes more sense to me than "yeah but".  I am not technically knowledgeable enough to judge the validity of your position, but do still hear in it a desire for "the perfect" over "the good", though I do get that you don't really consider SegWit to be "the good" because you think increase(s?) to blocksize via a hard fork to be the only viable path forward.  
I hear much disagreement with that in this sub including arguments that hard fork(s) carry huge risks. I'm still hoping for "the good" via the soft fork.  Sometimes it is not bad to kick cans down roads.  When we travel, we often find our way as the road reveals itself. (yes, I've been accused to mixed and multiple metaphors)
@_date: 2016-11-22 00:03:09
Even many Unlimited advocates seem to agree that Segwit changes are positive for Bitcoin.  They "just" want increased blocksize too.  Even from their perspective, I would venture that the perfect is the enemy of the good.  Causing development paralysis could undermine investors confidence in Bitcoin and leave miners with greatly reduced income due to Bitcoin price collapsing. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 11:40:32
This whole thing does hinge on one person - at a time.  Probably 100 persons, including Roger, can move SegWit adoption forward.  It is worth addressing each one, as we can, in as positive a way as we can manage.  What is our choice?

I love most of what you write, but would add that governments are socialist enterprises only in the ways that they act for the common good.  Otherwise they are corporate / fascist enterprises.
We are losing the rights of the enlightenment to the current corporate takeover, seized from the slightly more benevolent, but elitist and self-serving Liberal Democrats by the increasingly fascist Republicans.
Bitcoin potentially disintermediates a large swath of both corporate serving government and corporations themselves, and empowers individuals world-wide. Like electricity, it can improve conditions for billions of people, but does not change the underlying distributions of power (OK, it's a pun).
Blockchain technology, rooted in bitcoin, makes possible individually controlled identity and can become the basis of voting and governance, hollowing out corporate fascist capitalism from within. My hope, anyway, for what it's worth.

From what I can see, most people who seem to care about bitcoin agree that Segwit is a big step forward.
There are people who acknowledge that they want the benefits that Segwit would bring, but then they say, "yeah, but". The "yeah but" is that they also want a block size increase and a hard fork, and / or they don't trust Core, or they claim that Core promised them a size increase and did not deliver, or... and the list goes on.
If Segwit benefits Bitcoin, then I don't accept the "yeah, buts".  IMHO, improve Bitcoin with Segwit, and then argue about next steps if you want.

I agree that Roger does not seem to be popular on this sub.  I don't agree that I was attempting "to justify the witch-hunting that has happened here with regards to Roger" but you can and will interpret my words as you wish.
If we are all in on this "enterprise" known as Bitcoin, each of the 4 positions available on every issue affects everyone else who cares about Bitcoin; yea, nay, abstain, or modify.
By this definition, everything that is not a yea or an acceptable modification slows or blocks "the motion".  Yes, it is early in the process, and there are others openly opposed, a seemingly greater obstacle than those abstaining. But eventually, everyone gets to vote, with their signals, feet or with their voices.
A consensus process is difficult, at best.  If SegWit will benefit Bitcoin, then everyone gets to choose their own role.  I hope that you and Roger support it by becoming "yea", despite hurtful things uttered by some and distrust of future development processes.

I too have called for compromise on both subs.  But I have come to believe that those leading the BU forces are not interested in compromise.
There is no reason or evidence to think that Roger and Jihan would care about or respond favorably to any unilateral offer from Core, for any block size or mechanism to achieve it. No suggestion for compromise has ever been upvoted on the BU sub.
It does seem to have come down to a struggle for power and control.
@_date: 2017-04-02 15:33:04
1. Everybody but BU people seems to agree that Segwit effectively doubles block size.  Why do you not even acknowledge that?  The typical BU response is, "it's not enough" which I find lame.
2. Malleability is vital to off-chain scaling.  Even if you think that Lightening is a conflict of interest, other off chain solutions plan to use it. "Just to distract"?  Nothing but an insult.
3. I will leave this to someone with more technical knowledge than me, though I doubt that anyone else is reading this thread.
@_date: 2017-04-02 14:30:06
Core is a decentralized group - which is why it takes them so long and so much discussion to decide on courses of action.  Pro Segwit miners are also decentralized.
BU devs are completely centralized beneath their paymaster. Jihan would like his miners to be the same, but it is not yet clear if he can bang them into line. Nonetheless, his individual power is clear to see.
I have worked for large corporations and corporate influence on certain issues is clear.  Do you have one iota of evidence that AXA is pushing development in a certain direction?
@_date: 2017-04-20 19:33:15
Net, net, he is probably acting against his own best interests, when you consider what would become possible for Bitcoin and miners after segwit is implemented.  People act against their (our) best interests all the time.  I just finished reading The Undoing Project, which is about just that.
@_date: 2017-04-02 14:00:50

Only if lending is across currency.  Lenders are not fools.  It has always been their job to make sure that they will get paid.

We are using the phrase "killer app" in 2 different ways.  Google is a dominant app today.  That's one way.  The spreadsheet was the application that caused many people to go buy computers.  That's the other way.  Today, stored value, in spite of the drop from $1200, is the dominant app.  Is it "killer"? I think it is important, but not killer.  Killer will be the app that causes many more people to buy coin to spend.  Buying and selling coin, and paying much lower fees to do so, are crucial for increased usage.
It also occurs to me that a killer app might be one in which people don't even know that they are using bitcoin.  They are operating in fiat, but their bank or insurance company have found bitcoin to be an application that saves them time and money in the back office.  They send money in bitcoin to other institutions, but user doesn't even know or care that is happening.
Current exchanges are primitive, hard to use, opaque, and often unreliable.  If an institution like Schwab or Fidelity decided to use bitcoin and provide exchange services, they already have security, compliance and support organizations.  They answer the phone!  Bitcoin will not leap directly to institution-free transactions only.  There will be many steps in-between.

@_date: 2016-10-15 19:40:57
sorry, I can't follow your logic.  Maybe if you can give an example?  I don't see how credit is affected by the value of bitcoin.  If I have a car dealership and you want to buy a car, I can sell it to you on credit.  If your income is in bitcoin, and you want to pay in bitcoin, increasing or decreasing bitcoin value does not affect your payments and my income from you.  If you are paid in $dollars, I might decline to extend your credit in bitcoin thinking that increasing bitcoin value could undermine your ability to pay. So I'm thinking that credit is linked to currency, bitcoin or USD or Euro, etc.  As long as people want credit and others are willing to extend it, there will be credit, yes?
@_date: 2016-10-14 13:30:07
I don't understand why a higher price would discourage the general population.  If anything, it's a feature.  Buy some bitcoin to make a purchase, and, oh gee, look, it's now worth more.  If I want to buy a $20K car with bitcoin, why do I care if that is 30 bitcoin or 0.0003 bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-10-20 14:42:21
I am a left-wing Bitcoin enthusiast.  All new and evolving technologies of disintermediation can be used for both good and for evil. It is always fair to ask, who benefits and who loses from what applications and implementations.
There is a strong Libertarian trend among Bitcoin enthusiasts, stemming from a distrust of all institutions.  I favor a more detailed examination of every institution.  Who is served and who is harmed by what standards, policies and practices?
Bitcoin promises to allow ordinary people, all over the world, to exchange value with less exposure to self-serving banks and governments, AKA the 1%. While Bitcoin will not eliminate greed, it will force those institutions to be more transparent.
Woody Guthrie famously said, "I think that the whole world should be run by ... electricity."  Adherents of new technologies, like (formerly) electricity and now Bitcoin, must work to shape implementations that help ordinary people to have more capability and power.

You are creating a problem that already exists between other currencies.  Somehow credit continues.  See my other post.
@_date: 2016-10-16 19:21:19
You pick the worst case scenario and ignore the others.  Why?  I don't lend you anything unless I believe you can repay.  If you are getting paid in Bitcoin, you will be able to pay me back in Bitcoin.  If you are getting paid in $USD, I will only lend you $USD, not Bitcoin.  I assume lenders and borrowers are smart, and understand risks inherent in crossing currencies (similar problems could exist Yuan to dollar).  Cross currency transactions already exist and have not been problematic, or at least both parties have understood risks of uneven growth or loss of value.  There is still credit, in spite of the crashing of some currencies relative to others.  This is not a new risk, and certainly not a new risk caused by Bitcoin.

Again, there is not problem.  Lend in bitcoin, pay in bitcoin, lend in fiat, pay in fiat.  Lenders and borrowers around the world have been dealing with this for 2 thousand years.

Sorry that I am late to this conversation.  I don't know if anyone will see my comment.  I have also thought about voting - and also about polling, rating, and reviewing. Inventing a cool way to vote still depends upon politicians to implement it. Is there a way to not depend on politicians and pollsters?
Another approach could be to think about identity as the basis for all expression and to consider if identity can be owned by the individual rather than by institutions and governments, sort of like Bitcoin.  
What if, based upon biometric and demographic data, every person on earth could establish their own, unique, unimpeachable identity? Sort of like that Aadhaar system in India, but not controlled by the government.
To that identity we can then attach medical data, work data, and location, from block and village to state, nation, etc.  Individuals control their own data, and can choose who to release it to. User initiated polls can query everyone in a place, by age, by gender, by class, political party, family constellation, sports interest, by health issue, by educational concern, etc.
This system would have to have immediate benefits for all, to motivate participation. Once in place, it could generate far more accurate polls and votes. Would politicians use it? Like Bitcoin, they would try to suppress it, but the media could not ignore it.  It would become like a parallel, individually based government.
Instead of creating separate apps for separate functions, like voting, why not have a universal app with distributed, individually owned and controlled data, like Bitocoin?

If by the middle of July there is not sufficient support for  BP148, shouldn't it be withdrawn?  And shouldn't "sufficient support" be defined to include most of the major exchanges, most full nodes, and &gt;50% of the hash rate?
