i have being trying it trough bruteforce for all the day... give up... let`s work together: discord: milewski

Please let us know how many words are there on the answer, and if does involve modifying the "default" deviation path

someone gathered this data here: [

Hey guys i have being thinking in a theory that might make sense... latest clues from OP suggested infinity... space! got me thinking about constellation!!! that would be a way if somehow could align the constellation on top in such a way it connects all the words! maybe the tail could be the X ... maybe some of that date suggest how the constellation of X at that day...
Constellation are in Plain sight i believe, at least at night....

can you share you 4 first words.... so i can double check if we have same idea?
@_date: 2018-05-20 15:14:55
anyone has a list with all numbers and dates within the image?
@_date: 2018-05-22 02:48:13
can you confirm the method to verify the key if we are doing it right? or we are verifying it completely wrong?
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:06:10
i believe it's `m/49'/0'/0'/0/0`
@_date: 2018-05-20 14:46:14
actually the $500 went to another address, just `0.00000547` went to this puzzle address... anyone could have done that :) puzzle still on going...

which next button

discord: i have being brute-forcing all the day now 2am here have to go to sleep but will back at morning :D
@_date: 2018-05-21 04:40:56
even if we find the correct order there are N possible deviation paths it could be using ... we need this info otherwise there are literally no way for anyone to find out which is the correct deviant path.....

Who is queen to help building a brute\-force pool? or who\`s gonna join in? or everyone think it is not worth?
@_date: 2018-05-21 08:25:24
Guys i give up!!! head pain.... im thinking in building a permutation attack cluster! anyone would like to join in? there are 9.8k people online here if everyone joined at least we could have a chance to know some basic answer like: if we use it to try every single possible combination of words contained within the white area? and eventually every word on this image..
what i am proposing is building a website where all you have to do is just open a url .. and it would check a range of possibility let\`s say 0\-200 then user B check 201\-202 etc... and with enough time.. and computers we can crack it! ....

no he didnt he has just donated some money to OP address :D
@_date: 2018-05-21 15:09:39
u can generate the script: 
const keyhash = bitcoin.crypto.hash160(entity.getPublicKeyBuffer()) as Buffer
const scriptSig = bitcoin.script.witnessPubKeyHash.output.encode(keyhash)
const addressBytes = bitcoin.crypto.hash160(scriptSig)
const outputScript = bitcoin.script.scriptHash.output.encode(addressBytes)
const address = bitcoin.address.fromOutputScript(outputScript)

the numbers .. years... could be offset for the BIP39 words...
@_date: 2018-05-20 14:33:13
i have no idea about which app you are talking about...
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:18:14
post the answer here and we will verify if it is correct :)

Hey about the  **Image Manipulation** thing... it was very likely created in Adobe Illustrator!! and that white area was masked out... that means the OP indeed had 2 copies of every word overlapping each other bg orange and the white one masked at the circle... that is how any designer would do that... and if you are not an experient designer u might commit this mistake where the outline of the bg appears behind as you are seeing.... which is a float rounding problem! dont expect too much there all the other words also have a "orange" aliasing around .... if you inspect closer the actual RGB of each pixel around...
