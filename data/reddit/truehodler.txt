I bet this is a common thought “fuck i wish i just bought bitcoin,” but on the other hand I can’t blame you on chasing the juicy btc gains that can be found through trading alts.

Do you have other assets like stocks, bonds, precious metals, land and or a business? Or do you rent an apt and own nothing but bitcoin ?

So is this caused by the miner not willing to risk waiting to fill the block up more ? Is he afraid to get orphaned and lose the block reward ?

Someone should correct me if i am wrong but my understanding if it’s not a valid address the transaction will not completed and will be returned? I think you would only be fucked if you sent it to a valid address that is not yours

I agree there’s gotta be a way for these to be useful. Maybe someone would buy them for a renewable energy bitcoin mining project. Like a solar panel farm or a wind turbine field. Maybe Canada can stop selling our extra hydro for nothing and power these bad boys. What kinda hash rate we talkin ?

CNBC saying it’s game over for bitcoin is actually bullish. If they we’re telling me to buy then I would be worried. You can find better TA on the back of a cereal box.
P.s. he is a professional analyst for the stock market. Bitcoin has shown 0 correlation with stocks.

Makes sense doesn’t it ? I personally do not see people lining up to sell at a loss or break even.

Alot of shops probably only accept Bolivars (random guess) so
You exchange what you think you need then run to the store and spend it before it loses too much value.

Depends on the atm. My local one is a 2$ fixed fee below 1000 and 5$ above 1000
@_date: 2018-08-31 18:11:06
Use a bitcoin atm. No id needed but you will pay 5-10% above spot price. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 22:47:54
It was slightly off but not 20% off i guess i should clarify they are not all the same. Some
In town do charge 20% but there are some that sell close to spot like  5% instead of 20%. Same as some gold shops charged more over spot then others.

How do you increase your sat holdings without fiat if all you hold is bitcoin ? 
@_date: 2018-08-18 13:54:03
My guess is it will take some time for the network to reject your transaction then it will be returned. That’s my understanding of the protocol anyway, i think you would only be fucked if you sent it to another existing wallet that is not yours. I think your send address will be rejected

Nah, ride or die. Only invested what i can afford to lose so that I am not forced to sell low. But i agree the majority of alt coins will fail long term. But if we dip below 40% btc dominance again and etf runours are still alive i may have to become a btc maximalist 
@_date: 2018-08-20 18:37:37
I just went to check today to get you an exact number. The atm charges a 2$ flat fee and the price was 5% above spot price. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 23:07:12
Canada gets power from hydro &amp; nuclear and when we have too much we give it to the usa for free. We could power these instead 
@_date: 2018-08-18 17:13:39
The protocol does not just delete coins. You would have to send them to a valid address that’s not yours to lose them. If not the transaction cannot be completed and funds would be returned.

Find a no id btc atm and insert cash, the atm can send the funds directly to a no id wallet and or exchange. All you need at the atm is the scannable barcode to your wallet. Hope this helps, goodluck !

Basic wealth building 101; do not hoard fiat currency, instead spend it on assets that have a chance to grow in value as soon as possible.
Fiat currency is supposed to constantly lose value due to inflation to prevent hoarding. These inflation mechanics actually create stability even if it is on a downward trend.

I do not use coinbase. So i do not know. But any of the mobile wallets will work. Or a desktop wallet and print out the barcode. You can setup either pretty quick with no id.
The scanner is a bit bigger than a credit card so don’t make your print out too big if you use a desktop wallet. 
Just google search bitcoin atm to find them in your city.

Although this sounds like a great idea and gesture. Crypto can be very addictive and equal to gambling. It might not make you feel that great if you find out down the road one of your students went broke cause he caught the crypto bug from you and invested poorly.

Not really too happy about it. Bitcoin pumped and dumped and the only thing that really happened is alts got rekt. I am a little nervous to see if the same thing happens again on the next btc pump.
(I thought alts would gain back some sat value when btc fell back down)

That would be terrible for it’s practicality as a currency. Everything with have to be rounded to a  even dollar amount. I believe the max value it was designed for is 1 million per bitcoin or 1 penny per satoshi.

So I have noticed a trend in my area in the last 12-24 months. While big stores have the fancy tap credit card machines, Alot of small shops and convenience stores have stopped accepting credit cards and have gone back to cash or debit only with the odd one even having a bitcoin atm. With them further increasing rates i think you will see this trend strengthen.

Gold has been time tested and proven. It’s a great store of value and will be for many decades to come. It is also a great hedge bet when also investing in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is amazing and I love it, but i realize there is always a possibility quantum computing some how shows up next year or some other technology and totally fucks your shit up. It’s just not smart to ever put all your eggs in one basket.

look at most of the technology’s we are using today. Smart phones, self driving electric cars, gaming computers with virtual reality, smart tv’s, Fibre wire providing 1GB uploads and downloads, alot of these technologies seemed impossible 10 to 20 years ago. Who knows what technology we will have in the next 10 to 20 years. Nothing technology based is guaranteed to be secure in the long term.

In a recession I would feel totally comfortable holding a mix of income properties, small businesses that deal in commodities or essential services, gic’s, gold &amp; silver, bitcoin. Then once I felt we were breaking out of the recession I should be in a good position to buys some assets on the cheap.

@_date: 2019-04-06 19:00:27
I am not going to pretend to know how it works. I guess what I mean is that bitcoin is only 10 years old. Technology always advances. It’s anyones guess how long the chain/protocol will remain secure and usable. Anyone telling you they know the answer is lying or just guessing. Could be tomorrow, could be 83.7 years from now.

Wow, ouch. I have been watching from a far but I didn’t see what actually happened. If that is the case it kinda makes you wonder what the true number of coins lost actually is from the past 10 years total. How many hodlers have sufficient information in their will to recover their crypto.

If i were buying in today with 5k i would do the following. Set a buy order with 500$ at 5750. 1000$ at 4750. 1500$ at 3750. And finally 2000$ at 2750. If it drops sub 2000$ and heads for 1000$ i would think about saving up and doubling down with a 5k order around 1250$. But then again that’s just me and I am sure there are lot’s of strategies.

Haha no problem my dude. Just remember speculative investing is gambling and don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. I am not claiming to know where the bottom will be. But I do suggest using a weighted buy system as i showed an example of above.. The cheaper it gets the more you buy. If you set your range wide enough and don’t run out of fiat you should end up with a average buy near the bottom or close enough for a long position.
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:57:20
I like to be naive and hope that this crash was caused by profit taking and not selling at a loss. It is healthy and normal that those that made alot of money off the rise wanted to pull money out of the market. Those that are currently sitting at a loss need to be patient and hold to stabilize the market. But if your selling for profit all the power to ya.
