Go ahead and prove it wrong.
Update on 2017-11-22:  Moderator likes to censor any dissenting views, so I am blocked from replying to Anduckk below.

If you're right about China, then when are you going to dump BTC?  Chinese miners control BTC as much as they control BCH.

Oh my god, it's true. This thread censors out any dissenting viewpoints.  One of my comments got removed.
It's like the North Korean media.

Calvin was a huge promoter for Bitcoin for many years.  Gambling sites were the biggest initial users of the internet and bitcoin.  Gambling, such as SatoshiDice, was one of the first and only places you can use bitcoin, and still is.  Now, SatoshiDice only accepts BCH.  Are you going to badmouth SatoshiDice as well?
They switched to BCH because customers will not pay $6-$9 fees to make a bet.  Would you?  Where else can you use your bitcoin?  WalMart?  Costco?

Wow, this thread is a stunning good example of ad hominem.  Dictionaries should include this thread in their definition of ad hominem:  Attack the debaters, if you cannot attack the debate.

BCH would not exist if it wasn't for Core/Blockstream.  If Core/Blockstream didn't stifle BTC's scaling, all of these 7 people would still be promoting BTC.
Thanks to Core/Blockstream, thousands of BTC holders bought altcoins and eroded BTC's market share.  BTC should be at $10k to $20k right now.
Roger Ver had been promoting BTC since 2011, before most users on this thread heard of Bitcoin.  Every one of these 7 guys had been promoting BTC way more than any of the users on this thread.  Roger Ver helped create Blockchain.info, the biggest provider of BTC wallets, Bitcoin.com and several other companies that helped BTC grow.  Gavin Andresen took over from Satoshi Nakamoto.  Every one of the users on this thread owes a huge thanks to these 7 guys.  Without them, the users on this site would not have made as much money on their BTC holdings.
Only recently these 7 guys have started promoting BCH.  This is because of Core/Blockstream's adamance of not increasing the block size:
Why won't Core/Blockstream do it?  Because they want small blocks, high fees and slow confirmations to justify the need for off-chain scaling, which will create demand for their off-chain products.  This is the only way that Core/Blockstream will be able to repay their investors.
Users on this thread should be directing their anger at Core/Blockstream.  If Core/Blockstream did the right thing, everyone would be still in the same camp singing kumbaya.
By attacking the debaters instead of the debate, it shows that you are worse than the debaters.
When John McAfee said BTC will go to $500,000, I didn't hear anyone from the community attack him.
When Roger Ver said in 2011 that everyone in the world will eventually use Bitcoin, I didn't hear anyone from the community attack him.
When Roger Ver said in 2016 that 2017 will be BTC's best year, I didn't hear anyone from the community attack him.
When Gavin and Calvin were promoting BTC for several years, I didn't hear anyone from the community attacking them.
Where were your attacks back then?
