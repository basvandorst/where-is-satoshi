This is exactly why I'm considering it. You never know. I have a gut feeling that sooner or later, the average guy will not be able to get in anymore. If BTC does go up, I think the levels we are at now are the absolute last level the avg man can get it. After that it's an institutions and corporations-game. 
It might just be an irrational fomo-driven mind coming up with all kinds of scenarios
@_date: 2019-07-30 15:01:34
Definitely a valid perspective, appreciate your thoughts mate.
@_date: 2019-07-30 14:26:53
If that happens, that's the best thing to do yes
@_date: 2019-07-30 14:39:49
Seems like there are far more pros with buying oneself in w/o loan, but the one con with not missing the train might weigh out (?). I dont know, have to think on this one.
@_date: 2019-07-30 15:40:39
Credit cards cant buy you a bitcoin tho. Not in my case. It was really my only options when it comes to loans
@_date: 2019-07-31 14:47:08
Thanks brother. DCA in can only happen in increments though, in most people's case; every 1st and 15th. That in and of itself, especially with the sudden surges we saw from 4k to 10k, can, as you say, hurt me in the long run. Damn, I thought I had figured out a plan to simply DCA, but as I'm replying to you, I'm backpedaling  a little, lol.
@_date: 2019-07-30 14:26:17
Definitely fear of missing out, unfortunately
@_date: 2019-07-31 22:38:49
What do you mean "supposed to"? How do anyone know who's supposed to know? Is there some type of metaphysical soul-contract-viewing device in your time or something, lol,? I am being a bit sarcastic, but still, I'm kinda intrigued.
@_date: 2019-07-31 22:33:32
AND, the momentum of the collective consciousness, and of course individual consciousness decides what future is coming. Hence, future not set in stone. All futures are possible, but the future you experience depends on the momentum of the thoughts/belief system you have, which then translates to action if extended fully. This applies to the collective consciousness of this specific timeline Earth as well. But OP, if he really is a time travel (which I still do not believe), is right in that there is a probability of certain futures happening, which I guess are timelines closer to our own timeline, due to the similar momentum in collective belief system/karmic (action based on belief) behavior. So similar/like actions in this timeline (and energy-momentum based on belief), can make him "predict" the future.
@_date: 2019-07-31 22:15:02
yo dawg, you gotta admit, even if its not true, it's MAD entertaining tho
@_date: 2019-07-30 14:37:25
Indeed! Thanks mate
@_date: 2019-07-30 15:49:03
It's a personal loan my brother, yes. The total amount I'll pay if I spend 5 years will be 13k. So I'm basically paying 3,3k for the loan if I spend all 5 years to pay it off. If I can use a year, only 600$. Its not a credit card pay, so it is a 5 year payment.
@_date: 2019-07-30 15:31:33
That was my original plan, and I chances are high I'll go that path, and BTC not going to the moon that soon, is a rational take to fomo-plagued minds Haha.
@_date: 2019-07-31 22:36:23
for real. This is better than a movie. I'm not being sarcastic. I love this shit.
@_date: 2019-07-30 15:32:11
Fomo fever brotha, too dangerous haha, it can make your mind come up with the most irrational scenarios
@_date: 2019-07-30 14:43:32
I totally get what you're saying, but keep in mind that there's a social stigma with taking help from the social programs over here. I mean, security nets, definitely, but there is the notion of "failure" when using them.
@_date: 2019-07-31 22:11:26
Damn, even though I still don't 100% believe in you being from the future, this is incredibly fascinating and entertaining. But, listen; some of us have a understanding, even in our own time, that infinite parallell realities exist at the same time. I even experienced Mandela effect first hand, with a filter type of thing covering my reality to shift me to a timeline where new Mandela effects where happening. Did you find out in your time what Mandela effects are? Was it a mass timeline shift (not in time/space, but location; in space/time) to another alternate Earth? I know you are a TIME traveler (lol, if it indeed IS true, let's just say so for entertainment purposes for now); is there a correlation between space/time and time/space? One of the biggest Mandela effects where that many of us had shifted from an Earth in Saggitarius arm, to an Earth on Orion's Belt. Did scientists make an official statement of what happened there around 2016 when the mass population experienced a ME?
@_date: 2019-07-31 22:47:36
I'm not a "timetraveler", lol, but I think I know how it works. All timelines are parallel, independent timelines. So, if you he does something here, let's say kill his mother, and returns to his own timeline, in his his original timeline, he will still be alive, even if he killed her, because time is not is not a single continuum in ONE timeline. This timeline is it's own separate timeline. His original timeline is it's own separate timeline. Not in the way that he cannot interact with the different timelines, but there are infinite versions of you, so there are infinite timelines that co-exist separately. All realities co-exist now, in a sense, and since ultimately there is no time, only the perceiver of time (consciousness, the one who experiences time), there is only different versions of the present moment. Thus there are no timeline paradoxes. I think this is the truest version to how this works.
@_date: 2019-07-30 20:26:18
Haha forreal! ����
@_date: 2019-07-31 22:29:41
in another post he said that they still don't know who Satoshi is.
@_date: 2019-07-30 14:53:25
Solid point. I'm thinking about downplaying the loan within 5 months though, which I can do. But you are absolutely right, firing can happen, bankruptcy etc..
@_date: 2019-07-31 22:23:32
How are people spiritually? Not in terms of religion, but I mean mentally? Are they much more peaceful and seem to have reached an ascended mind state above their mind? To rephrase; tech advancements have happened, but more importantly, has there been any spiritual advancements? Have people realized that they are consciousness beyond thought, feelings and objective phenomenon (people, places, events etc)?
Also: is Nintendo still around?
And: Kendrick Lamar, Jay-Z, Nas, are they still around? Michael Jackson (do people get to know the official version of the truth about him?).
@_date: 2019-07-30 20:27:53
Well said. But there might be a point where even us in the first world won't be able to get 1, right now though; you're absolutely right
@_date: 2019-07-31 22:58:16
A Continuing timeline is what I thought it used to be before, until I stepped into the nature of time and consciousness. Maybe I got it wrong. Remember also that a continuous timeline can also be in the form of different multiple continuous timelines.
@_date: 2019-07-30 14:36:35
Probably around the same. I'm a newly educated teacher. I'm from Scandinavia though, so inflation rate might not play out the same way as in the US. 200$, I honestly don't have anything to spend it on. Nothing on my wish list, as I'm frankly saturated by new cellies and tech etc. My goal is to simply establish myself with a financial foundation, and BTC seems like a investment worth looking into. I've been in the space since 2017 though, so I'm not completely new, and know a little.
@_date: 2019-07-31 14:44:03
Absolutely. One part of me says that there's no way it can go up as quickly as some say. But if we look at when It was at 4k in March, to when it went to 10k, I mean, that happened rapidly.
@_date: 2019-07-31 22:28:38
bro, honestly. That doesn't seem possible. There has never been an upshot as rapid as you describe it. 100k in mere months? That isn't possible my friend.
@_date: 2019-07-30 14:57:26
Haha, to be able to say you own 1 BTC, with the passion you have for the tech in the trunk, that's too dope to me.
@_date: 2019-07-30 15:35:06
DCA plus not loan is a huge pro to proceding w/o loan. And putting it that way, you have a point
@_date: 2019-07-30 16:43:18
My bad. I meant to say, the last levels the average man would be able to obtain 1 BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-31 23:00:00
How do you know that this is not a totally different variant of your own timeline, where it pans out totally different than what you claim is the future? Also; "IF it happens", seems like a cop out. but fair enough, you don't want us to believe you anyway. All good though
@_date: 2019-11-24 20:54:08
Lol, nah...I dont think I'm selling nothing. I'd easily take the loss, than selling
@_date: 2019-11-24 20:48:29
The graph is not that impressive then. The window of mistake is smaller in such a small time. So... meh
@_date: 2019-11-29 08:51:07
Cricket when tea
@_date: 2019-11-24 21:04:34
Good plan my brotha. Seems like you invest smartly. Who the eff cares if you what you have invested was going to be used on clothes or tech or a new watch anyway. Losses for this type of money is no big deal. We consume too much anyway. I rather invest in future tech than that
@_date: 2019-11-27 12:24:44
Take a chance but don't be attached to it. Treat it like a fun side project, where the game is to slowly gather as much BTC as possible. Slow gains each month for things that otherwise would be spent on a piece of clothing or tech or something makes sure you dont think too much about it. So yes, take a small chance that in reality is - if BTC goes below loss - is just the loss of having a new smartwatch each month; you don't need it in other words.
@_date: 2019-11-24 20:27:11
Eh, my friend, it has been down to 3000$. This year.  it would have been more proficient to post this statement in January 2019.
@_date: 2019-11-24 20:42:38
Pretty sick
@_date: 2019-11-24 20:43:09
Stupid question perhaps, but when did he make this graph?
@_date: 2019-08-02 09:02:19
lol, the timetravel is mad-entertaining, but he claimed 100k at the end of Jan, 2020. It's not possible. So I call b.s. Such a massive move in a couple of months, no.
@_date: 2019-08-02 19:13:48
Lol, that too ofc
@_date: 2019-08-13 19:03:45
Haha word
@_date: 2019-08-05 13:11:01
It would be nice, but honestly, it seems too dramatic a move in such a short period. I don't think it's possible. You never know with BTC tho.
@_date: 2019-08-05 13:12:01
wasn't there a response from one of Trump's sidemen a couple of days ago that "even if we wanted to shut Bitcoin down, we wouldn't be able to do it?"
@_date: 2019-08-09 08:25:58
This one was sick. I couldn't believe it when I first saw it. Straight up lying to our faces; shows how sly and cunning these people can be.
@_date: 2019-08-05 14:58:30
Niggaz can't touch shit. They know it. I think many of them are panicking big time
@_date: 2019-08-02 09:06:56
bro, not to be rude, but HOW is it going to go to 100k that quickly? You realize there's only, what, 5 months left until 2020, right?
@_date: 2019-08-24 20:18:11
Not with a ledger tho
@_date: 2019-08-07 09:59:19
Remind me! January 2020
@_date: 2019-08-18 16:11:51
Is the awareness of BTC increasing in Venezuela? Are people gravitating towards it?
@_date: 2019-08-05 13:49:43
True, I don't disagree with you. If you ARE going to buy something, do it with BTC. You just have to re-buy another 1 BTC. But at this time, I feel like the fluctuations are so big, that you could lose a little while converting USD to BTC again. Not much though so I get you.
@_date: 2019-10-18 14:18:51
Same. I know now to not try. Their call
@_date: 2019-08-04 20:51:05
This was honestly amazing
@_date: 2019-10-18 14:40:30
Maybe   he wasn't confident himself, and didn't know whether or not it would be as high in price as it is today. Some friends don't want to 1)look stupid, 2) risk others for something they have invested in.
@_date: 2019-10-28 21:04:35
Ok, wtf is happening...
@_date: 2019-08-05 13:30:17
that spending power he had with bitcoin could triple or double in a couple of months. I'm not saying, do not spend, because obviously it is good for BTC as a whole, but now is a good time to have a solid foundation of BTC, a buffer. I'm personally also going for 1 BTC before anything.
@_date: 2019-08-02 21:41:21
This was valuable! I'll definitely but smaller amounts.
@_date: 2019-10-28 18:36:03
Haha, what is the reference from again?
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:24:31
Still a lot of time left. But we will see for sure if this "prophecy" stuff is b.s or not. This is it.
@_date: 2019-10-27 14:21:32
Lets face it and use our logic. He is b essing us. And it long until December anyway.
@_date: 2019-10-18 14:24:30
Me 2. No need to speak anymore.
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:22:54
Not directly related to what you're saying; but I've honestly stopped giving advice to my friends on it. I've tried to advice them to have at least some invested, not much, but enough. They are interested but nobody wants to buy. Now I just act like it doesn't exist lol
@_date: 2019-08-19 13:19:09
I took a loan for 1 btc. And earlier this month I asked people here the same question. And honestly, I dont regret it at all. It was probably the best thing I've done in a long time. BUT you have to be sure that what you pay is sufficiently coming in. If it is money you can't afford to lose, don't do it. I live in Norway, a country which has the best safety net in the world. And, I'm also a teacher with a relatively stable income. Half my salary goes to paying it off. I'll probably have it off in 5 months time. 
It all depends on how much you are paying for it per month.
The upside to my strategy is that I'm 100 percent on the train if it takes off. The downside is; my freedom is gone. But only for 5 months
@_date: 2019-12-21 22:20:16
Ooof. Nice
@_date: 2019-08-11 11:38:43
So most likely it won't happen?
@_date: 2018-03-19 21:39:07

Ok perf! Thanks!
@_date: 2019-09-11 14:01:58
Is it possible to see how many own at least 1 BTC?
@_date: 2019-09-10 07:26:06
If you start investing now, you are on a very good initial phase of slowly diversifying into a solid portfolio. I'm not talking about Bitcoin and Allcoin diversification, but an all-around portfolio everything. Bitcoin, gold, stocks, oil or someth ing.  I'm 30 now, and I wish I had the start you Can have. Starting with Bitcoin is not a bad idea at all. Moving into others as well is very ideal
@_date: 2019-09-11 06:04:16
Ok, thank you
@_date: 2019-09-10 10:45:35
I'm totally out of loop regarding this. what does it me as a BTC holder? What do I have to do? I have a nano ledger S.
