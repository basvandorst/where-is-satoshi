It depends on the nature of the transactions included in the block and the proportion of those that are between SegWit addresses.

do you want to update this metric now that a day has passed? Already, Sleepyark is less centralized. Nodes on the edge of the network will never be as distributed as those in the center. With time, all nodes move to the center. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:30:18
I'd be interested in seeing this updated daily. I think you'll see the trend emerge. As of today, an update to this title should read: "8% of LNs are orphaned when SLEEPYARK goes offline."
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:49:55

@_date: 2018-01-28 22:20:49
Nah, the distinction is whether nodes actually depend on a single centralized node or whether there are just nodes with many channels open. Dependency is problematic, many channels are not.

A well connected node is not the same as a centralized hub and spoke model. The average node currently has 6 connections. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:08:38
There is no practical implication of the percent of “routes failed” if there are other routes available between the same nodes.

Curious- why is the blocksize increasing when the transaction % isn't increasing as well? Does this really signal adoption?
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:39:36
$2 is too expensive. Glad we have LN incoming.
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:37:14
Currently it is decentralized although I would prefer if it was distributed. There are certain parts of the network that appear distributed. Everyday we are adding more channels than nodes. This trend is encouraging. Distribution seems best at the center of the network. The "leading edges" on the periphery are less decentrazlied but over the course of a few days those improve as well as new channels and nodes are added.
@_date: 2018-01-28 05:22:15
This one should make it easier for you to interpret: 
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:46:02
There are several components of a block. SegWit decreases the proportion of the block that is taken up by signatures which can instead be used for transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:16:53
Why isn't transaction % increasing?
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:38:24
This is a question I would love answered.
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:18:01
I calculated 8% of nodes would be orphaned if Sleepyark fails. Let's see what you come up with. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:49:08
The signatures are not taken out, they are organized more efficiently.

He's being sarcastic. BCH had a hard fork because of the EDA bug. Some miners continue to mine the original BCH (now called Bitcoin Clashic) though most bcashers don't recognize it.
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:42:38
I think it is nice to have critics around, but I also hope that these critics own some Bitcoin so they don't miss out on the upside.
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:00:57
You just made this metric up. Default lightning wallets will connect automatically to 3-6 nodes, it’s a non-issue. People are choosing to connect to only one node, that doesn’t make it centralized. If that one fails they can connect to someone else. Centralized nodes are obligated to connect to their parent node. This isn’t the case in LN. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:10:54
Sounds good, have a nice day!
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:57:16
Just because some nodes have many channels does not make it a "hub and spoke" distribution. Most nodes have many connections (average is 6) and the current distribution (while early and not perfect) is decentralized.

SegWit is a way of organizing a bitcoin block more efficiently so that the effective blocksize can increase. Lightning Network is a layer on top of Bitcoin that allows essentially free and instant payments off-chain that later settle on-chain.

They could also be test transactions from a real actor (an exchange, for example)
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:58:03
The "payments" don't "fail," there just isn't a payment channel there anymore and you have to make a new one. The default of lightning wallets will be to create 3-6 channels each.
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:30:57
I don't know if I understand what you're asking
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:01:37

No reason to fear a well connected node. This is not the same as centralization.
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:18:07
Thank you! So the SegWit heavy blocks are diluted out in the first graph.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:41:05
The 19% is merely a reflection of connected nodes not being able to route to the 8% orphaned nodes. Implicit in saying "8% of nodes would be orphaned if Sleepyark fails" is an understanding that you can't route to an orphaned node. Counting all the nodes that can't connect to an orphan is redundant and inflates your numbers.
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:00:16
Thank you. Is there an average transaction size? That way I can multiply that by the sat/byte to arrive at an average transaction cost?

Looking at BCH in terms of USD misses that there is a third place that you could have put your money: Bitcoin. Looking at BCH in terms of Bitcoin shows the real story. BCH declining from 0.2 Bitcoin to today's new low of 0.07 Bitcoin.

How would the private keys only appear when you died? 
The point is that hardware wallets, paper wallets, brain wallets, etc have many vulnerabilities that people ignore because they are happy that the classic "big business" or "big government" villain is out of the loop. Investors with a lot of BTC demand insurance and next-of-kin planning for peace of mind and that is why Coinbase has 8 million users in 25 countries. Just like cash, it is okay to keep a small amount of money in your house or in your back pocket, but this is unwise for large amounts.
Edit- to bring up an example you used: it would also be unwise to keep a $100,000 piece of jewelry in your home. People keep these kinds of things in Bank safe deposit boxes for the same reason why people use Coinbase: it is insured, and there is institutionalized next-of-kin protocols.

How is that better than trusting coinbase? Keeping a paper wallet at the bank still requires you to trust the bank, your insurer, and whoever would have to retrieve the paper wallet when you die. What if your heir is 8 years old? You trust him with a paper wallet with 100 BTC on it? Hope he keeps that private key safe. I'd rather have Coinbase handle it. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:21:19
This sounds very conspiratorial. No one told me to call it bcash. This is also the name Charlie Lee, Charlie Shrem, Bitcoin Core, Trezor, Blockstream, and Peter Todd use to name a few.

There is risk with any way of storing bitcoin. People think that their paper wallet or Trezor is bulletproof, but what if you get hit by a bus? What if there's a fire? What if it is lost or stolen? Coinbase has next-of-kin protocol in the event of  death and is insured. Individuals with large amounts of Bitcoin demand these protections, which are impossible with paper, hardware, or software wallets.
You are correct that Coinbase's social media mention of "bitcoin network congestion" was incorrect. Calling it a "lie" is a bridge too far, in my opinion, but predictably led to subsequent hysteria.  
Edit: to those responding that their wallet "can survive a fire" etc, great. What about every other scenario I listed?

Exactly. Finally we are starting to learn the lesson that **we don't need one coin with every feature.** Want a fast transaction? Use Litecoin. Want a smart contract? Use Ethereum.

I think people are relieved that the big block debate is over and that Bitcoin emerged unscathed. Also people are converting their bcash to bitcoin.

Honestly- I hate bcash and for that reason I'm not selling it. Cryptocurrency is hard to predict, and although I don't see any redeeming qualities of bcash, I don't trust myself because I hate it. When I can think dispassionately about it, I will re-evaluate. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:06:12
Please educate me on how a hardware wallet decides how to split up your BTC among your kin in the event of your death and ensures that they are transferred safely to these kin, some of which may be children.

@_date: 2017-08-06 19:10:24
Do we know who started calling it bcash? I see it everywhere- media, exchanges, developers. I agree the point is to separate it from Bitcoin, and rightfully so- it was a fork, afterall. Like Gavin, I will call it Bitcoin once it surpasses the real Bitcoin's hashpower. Of course, you can call it Bitcoin if you'd like.
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:58:29
This isn't true. Mainstream investors, even large ones, in the West keep their BTC on services like Coinbase and won't even have access to their BCH. Coinbase has 8 *million* users and only a small fraction withdrew their BTC for the fork. Claiming BCH from a private key is also a technically difficult endeavor for the few that pursue it. BCH's wide distribution is an illusion. Don't believe me? Wait a month and I guarantee that &lt;0.1% of BCH addresses will have participated in any transactions.

If you trust a person with your private key, then that is no better than trusting coinbase and what you have isn't really a hardware wallet. Even with clear instructions, unsophisticated users can and will make mistakes. Your bitcoin will only be as secure as your mother's understanding of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:48:56

Eventually BCH will fail (ie, never get adopted or have a sizable market cap). Rather than admit that BCH failed based on the merits, the people will blame Bitcoin supporters. Just wait.

Electron Cash crashes whenever I open it :(
Why the fuck does every wallet insist I run a full node.
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:05:03
Serious question: I've been trying for 3 hours to find an osx wallet that I can load my bcash onto before it falls to 0. Electron Cash crashes whenever I load it. Jaxx doesn't support bcash yet. BitcoinABC and Bitcoin Unlimited require that I run a full node which will take a week to setup. All the other wallets are hardware (Trezor, Ledger) or android (Freewallet, Coinomi) wallets from what I can tell. Any suggestions of an osx or online wallet for bcash??? I need to be able to load from a private key.
Edit: I got Electron Cash to work by updating my osx. As soon as I realized how hard it is to sell bcash, the urgency to do so became clear. When it becomes easier to sell, everyone will do it. Coinbase is actually propping up bcash by forcing their 8 million users to hold until January 1st.

Great! I'm still holding my bcash because I can't find anywhere to sell it easily.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:35:58
Who in your "estate" would you be trusting with your private keys? If you are trusting a human with your private keys, then that is not really a hardware wallet and not any better than trusting Coinbase. Furthermore, maybe a handful of people would actually do this kind of estate planning (vs Coinbase where it is institutionalized and everyone has this protection).
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:26:14

Nah, probably not.

From what I can see, it looks like they are opposing a segwit2x *hard fork*.
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:38:30
Publicity is a small part too. Most important is the network hashrate. The problem with bcash distribution is that it has been left on people's doorsteps, but most of these people won't ever use bcash. Millions of people on US exchanges have been "distributed" bcash but literally can't use it. So it appears to be widely distributed but really isn't. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:15:30

Rather than deliberating over the subjective "grounds" for what is and is not Bitcoin, I advise just calling Bitcoin Bitcoin. Quite simple. Bcash should be able to survive (or not) based on its own merits, not by borrowing the brand of the real Bitcoin.

Bitcoin.com is also calling BCH "Bitcoin." The app is part of a larger misinformation campaign.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:13:44
What is the same for all of these coins is they are trying to leech off the brand of Bitcoin. If the idea was to restrict "Bitcoin" to the true Bitcoin but also forks, that has already failed. So instead there is just Bitcoin and thousands of alts.

It all comes back to this: bcashers think that the value proposition of Bitcoin is getting your local Pizza Ranch to accept it. However, bcash offers nothing to Pizza Ranch that they can't already get with Apple Pay. Bitcoin gets it right: first put Bitcoin in everyone's pocket. Then the rest comes naturally: people will start to exchange it with each other.

Furthermore, to use bcash at a retailer, you first have to buy bcash at an exchange which is a huge pain in the ass vs Apple Pay. Then, the retailer has to sell it. Another huge pain. It will never beat Apple Pay.

This is actually incorrect. What you are describing is a transparent, frictionless free market. However, when coins are sold off the OTC market to qualified investors (a barrier to entry) at an unknown price (non-transparent), then changes in price on the open market are minimized. There are VCs (like Tim Draper with Silk Road coins) who are not interested in buying/selling on exchanges and this is the only place where they make deals.

Does fraud require damages? Genuine question
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:03:07
How did you decide that alt coins start at 0?
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:40:42
Even the fact that it's centralized doesn't bother me because this is obvious and people use at their own risk. However, fraud and deception are unacceptable.
@_date: 2018-04-28 11:29:53
Still too high. It’s 15% in USA. 
Edit: assuming long term
@_date: 2018-04-03 19:18:01
Yeah but it's harder to shout that across a room.
@_date: 2018-04-11 12:37:24
It's possible block never get full again. Bitcoin was in a speculative mania, and since then SegWit adoption has increased, exchanges are batching, and Lightning is on mainnet. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:43:54
Nah, one is reality and the other is conspiracy.
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:48:00
Selected lies and conspiracies: Craig Wright, AXA, Bilderbergs, Lightning will always be 18 months away, Bcash is the real Bitcoin, Blockstream is crippling Bitcoin to profit from LN, etc
@_date: 2018-04-02 01:28:01
Bcash highway looks like a street in North Korea.

Instead of importing the seed, why not just important the single private key that contained the BTC?
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:54:15
You assume that the only kind of congestion is Mempool congestion.
@_date: 2017-07-30 02:15:00
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:51:51
What if all your BTC is at one address? Couldn't you just expose that one private key and keep your seed as is? I don't want to memorize another 12 word phrase (it's harder than it sounds!).
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:49:07
I just suggest you think about where else the process of moving coins from cold storage at coinbase to an outside address can be congested. Regardless, it looks like most people have their coins now, so the controversy is over. Happy forking tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-07-30 23:41:21
Moving BTC from your Coinbase vault to your Coinbase wallet, of course, should be essentially instant. Took 27 hours for me to move my BTC out of Coinbase... I agree with everyone else that this isn't a big deal. Looking forward to moving it back as soon as this fork is over.
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:33:29
You assume the only kind of congestion is "bitcoin network congestion."
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:16:51
Lots of people with tinfoil hats, I see.
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:12:45
This is my plan: I currently have BTC on Electrum. After a few blocks of BCH are mined on 8/1, I will move the BTC to coinbase. Then, I will use the private key of the (now empty) electrum address and load it onto a BCH wallet. Eventually, I will sell the BCH for BTC and move that onto Coinbase as well.
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:18:51
Yes- I don't think it is done. It is a process. Not everyone decided to withdraw at once. Congestion + the rigors of cold storage is a perfectly acceptable explanation.
@_date: 2017-07-30 23:38:20
Took 27 hours for me to move a fair amount of BTC over the weekend. Doesn't seem like a big deal to me.

In a few days we can all look back on wild-eyed posts like this and have a good laugh.

Why do they have to be separate machines? Also, why not keep your BTC with your original seed and just send your BTC to another address in your wallet (and only reveal the old private key)?
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:21:05
My personal estimation was that the everyday scenarios I mentioned (theft, fires, etc) are more likely than a US government coin-grab. If you had $500K in coin, what would be your plan to deal with: accidental death, fire, flood, theft?
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:38:57
Yes, if I was a pedo then I wouldn't use coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:37:04
Nothing is risk free. 2FA (non-SMS) on coinbase with insurance is very low risk. Hardware wallets have the same problems as paper wallets and "brain" wallets: floods, fires, theft, car accidents, no secure next-of-kin transfer. These risks are higher (in my estimation) than breaching non-SMS 2FA on a US Exchange with insurance and next-of-kin protocols.
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:16:04
Yes. They are moving millions of dollars worth of BTC from cold storage. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 00:36:03
This doesn't protect against floods, fires, theft. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:50:57
Just as a thought experiment, what would you do if you had $500K in bitcoin? Would you feel comfortable with your hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-06-11 00:35:16
This is an over generalization. Keeping coins in coinbase, for example has many benefits including insurance. Fanboys think that that cold storage is best, but what happens when you get hit by a car or your house burns down or you're robbed? A robust exchange like Coinbase has protocols to give your coin to your next of kin and insurance that you can't get with your novelty wallet.

@_date: 2017-06-11 11:37:04
OK, so when you die your 12 year old goes to get your private key from the safe deposit box that has $600K. Are you confident that he will keep it private and safe and handle it properly? Furthermore, keeping a key in a bank requires the same trust as just keeping your key on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:41:47
Which do you think has happened more: people have their coin lost/stolen on coinbase or people have their paper wallet lost/stolen?
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:00:07
Well I know the answer: robberies, fires, floods, car accidents, etc happen everyday. Lloyd's of London (the insurer of Coinbase) has a consistent track record since **1631**.
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:33:02
Most people don't have a next-of-kin that is sophisticated enough to know how to use a seed/backup. If your kin enlists help to use your seed, it could easily get stolen. If someone has $100K+ in coin and a kin who is 7 (or 70) years old, a seed/backup isn't an option.
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:51:32
Sounds like we have to agree to disagree. I think you may have a simplified understanding of "cold storage transfer." It's different than what you do in your basement with your paper wallet.
