I went to check them out and the website is down. Have they gone bankrupt, or is the url not

Has anybody used software like this? I can't help but think it would be full of scams, otherwise it's a genius idea.

I actually don't own any bitcoins :(
I am looking to make sure that this will work before I start using greenaddress, then I'll probably get a few.

Okay, thanks. Never good when the service holding your money goes bankrupt.

I understand what you're saying, and a lot of me wishes the entire world would accept bitcoin, but I live in upstate NY, I may be the only person within a 100 mile area that even has considered using bitcoin (much less accepts it at stores and the like). At the moment I don't even have a single bitcoin to my name, and the only way I intend to own any is if I have an account that I can transfer Bitcoins to and spend them like regular money. I also live in the US, so my USD$ is relatively stable, and while Fiat money is only worth something because it people accept it, the same goes for Bitcoin, only bitcoin is electronic and decentralized. 
I am just looking for a bitcoin wallet service that I can use to give me a way to spend my bitcoins anywhere, and I'm asking for peoples experience with them and what ones people consider to be the best/lowest in fees.
Edit: I think I just restated what  said, I guess I should read all comments before replying.

Well yes, but that does take extra time. If there's a block every 10 minutes and I have to wait 25 blocks that's 250 minutes, or a little over 2 hours. While 2 hours is acceptable, the fact that I had to pay 1$+ for it kind of expensive. Imagine people trying to do in person transactions. I'm sure this is really hurting mass adoption.
Also, 25 blocks is the lowest dynamic fee in electrum.

If bitcoin is only used as a wire transaction alternative and never used for most transactions speculation will die out and the market will collapse. 70% of Bitcoin transactions are speculation. That speculation is in hope that we hit mass adoption and the price of Bitcoin soars (and in order to do that we need lower transaction fees).
