Re:  Warning Concerning Unlawful Conduct of Money Transmission Business
Dear Sir/Madam:
It has come to the attention of the Commissioner that BitCoin Foundation may be
engaged in the business of money transmission without having obtained the license or
proper authorization required by the California Financial Code.
YOU ARE HEREBY WARNED TO CEASE AND DESIST FROM CONDUCTING THE
BUSINESS Of MONEY TRANSMISSION IN THIS STATE. FAILURE TO DO SO WILL
RESULT IN APPROPRIATE ACTION BEING TAKEN.
Subject to certain exceptions, Financial Code § 2030 provides that no person shall
engage in the business of money transmission in California without first obtaining a
license from the Commissioner of Financial Institutions.
Any person who violates Financial Code § 2030 is subject to civil money penalties of
$1,000 for each violation or 1,000 per day under financial Code 9 21 51 and/or criminal
prosecution under Financial Code §2152. Conviction under Financial Code § 2152
could result in a fine and/or imprisonment. The California Attorney General may also
institute suit pursuant to Business and Professions Code §§ 17200, 17205 and 17206,
which can result in imposition of penalties of up to 52,500 per violation of statutory law
(that is, per day or per transaction).
In addition, under § 1960 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, it is a felony violation of federal
law to own, control, or conduct the business of money transmission which is operated
without the appropriate State license, or which fails to register with the U.S. Treasury
department, or which transmits funds known to have been derived from criminal activity
or intended to be used to promote or support unlawful activity. Violations of §1960 are
punishable by up to 5 years in prison and a _250,000 fine. Additionally, this activity
conducted without a license is a felony under California law, pursuant to financial Code
9 2152(b).
