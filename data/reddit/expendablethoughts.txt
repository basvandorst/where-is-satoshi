I'm down to 50% return from 120% return last week, boohooo!

Same here, turned 5000 into 11, now it's 7000, but with a lower break even point. When it goes back to last week's levels, I'll be at 15K+.

Seriously, what about this comment could make anyone want to downvote it?

All I see is long delays, etc. Whatever happens, LTC and ETH blockchain works, and I can always withdraw coins to other exchanges and withdraw from there. Sure, it's not the most convenient, but so far, I realized every exchange has its good sides and its bad ones, so I optimize my trades/withdrawals by buying somewhere, trading somewhere else, and withdrawing from a third place.
I usually pay 5-20$ to do all that shuffling, but I've only had to authenticate 2 exchanges, one of which was extremely easy to do (QuadrigaCX).
I know bears like crashing markets, but I think instigating fear for the sake of making a quick gain is absolutely despicable. If you have *any serious information* please do share!

What information can you provide on that? Just been googling for a few minutes here and I can't find anything serious on that?

Yeah, the 3.8% fee on coinbase looked bad at first, but when I realized sending the money took so long and I could do 5-10% in a few minutes if I buy quick enough, it suddenly made a lot of sense.

You can buy there and transfer to an exchange afterwards. Or trade on GDAX and then send your money to another exchange and cash out there.
Or hodl forever!

I use bitfinex, I was on Kraken before. Bitfinex takes forever to authenticate (1 month+ for me so far), while Kraken is lightning fast, took me 3 days.
You can deal in CAD on Kraken, but there's little volume, and the withdrawals are 60USD a pop.
Bitfinex has lots of coins, lots of volume too (great when you need to sell quickly).
Keep in mind you can transfer your coins from one exchange to the other, so you can definitely try them out and change, or even make gains on one and switch to the other to cash out.

Use QuadrigaCX, best for Canadian withdrawals IMO. Equifax verification, super quick, no need for more verification unless you want to withdraw something like 100k
