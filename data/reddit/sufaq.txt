In 2004, the Internet rose to a level of complexity that it became self-aware and sentient.
By 2008, it had decided that it wished to own property to use as incentive to influence its human peripherals.
In January 2009, it released Bitcoin under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.

I don't see the event you are talking about.  It did go to $32 in 2011, but it never dropped to $0.01.
It dropped to about $2 which quickly went to $4 and then $7.
Your claim is two orders of magnitude different than reality.  That's pretty important because if the same thing happened right it would actually be dropping from $223 to about $17.
But your claim would be that it would drop from $223 to $0.17.  That's a pretty big change.
In 2011 there wasn't nearly as much infrastructure as there is now.  The main infrastructure that did exist was the Mt. GOX exchange so that there could even be a USD/BTC rate that was fairly solid.
That exchange was hacked and account funds were stolen.  Although the bitcoin protocol itself was still solid, the only real infrastructure had been proven to be fairly worthless.   Therefore, bitcoin was re-valued by the market to less than 10% of it's former price.
However, the market did quickly realize that Mt. Gox != bitcoin and that Bitcoin was still solid in it's fundamentals.  As Mt. Gox solved their security problem and other exchanges emerges, the price recovered.
Today, Mt. Gox has too much concentration in the infrastructure and another security breach at Mt. Gox would still have devastating effects.  It would probably wipe out Mt. Gox, but would have a more limited effect on Bitcoin price because other exchanges exist.  Maybe a drop to 70% of it's current value would result.

It is actually extremely common.
Once upon a time, the Costa Rican colones was on par with the U.S. dollar.  Amazingly they were actually more irresponsible than even the U.S. government and it is now 500,000 colones per dollar.
They actually didn't re-denominate like most countries.  They just stated saying cinco cientos mil or (five hundred thousand).  The "mil" is a quick easy to say word, so they never cared about re-denominating.
Look up "shekel" on Wikipedia though to see how many times Israel has re-denominated.  The current shekel was once known as a "new shekel" while the old one was called the "old shekel."
That happens all the time when people get tired of dealing with huge numbers.
Oddly, that is one of the problems that bitcoin eventually solves.  Other currencies got those huge numbers by devaluing their currency (printing more out of thin air and therefore making the existing notes worth less).
Once bitcoin is widely adopted and has reached a stable price, there will be only insignificant minting (and no minting at all after 2140).   It won't devalue like other currencies so you can get used to 1 microbit being worth the same as it was for your grandparents or whatever.  Bitcoin actually offers stability in that way.

Yes.  It has repeated by you barbarians who vote and use other violent means to attempt to coerce others.  Evil exists.  Chaos exists.  I haven't claimed otherwise.
Good also exists.  Organization also exists.  I have a strong commitment to only associate with societal groups that are good in nature.
I don't really have much preference for either chaos or organization.  I don't really care very much.  Some of my societal participation is among societal groups who prefer organization.  Some are among groups that are generally rather chaotic and unorganized.  Neither makes me especially more or less comfortable than the other.

Exactly.  All new paradigms are accepted at viral rates until market saturation.
One reason that investors are confused is that they never get to be a part of that because an IPO usually comes AFTER the viral growth phase.
This is a currency, not a stock.  There will be no IPO.  It is more like the Internet itself in that regard.  It confused everyone too with it's society changing viral growth rate.

This actually already exists in many countries for pre-paid phone cards.
The problem with a paper note is that you can see through it.
Also if you don't have a smartphone to check the balance, then you can't tell if the note is loaded or not.  If you do have a smartphone, then why not use it to make the transaction?
The way other countries (ones with bank systems that aren't utilized very often due to hassle or the populace just not even having ID) handle this is with cards.
On the front is the denomination loaded on the card by the trusted authority.  On the back is a scratch off area.  Under the scratch off area is the private key that is then keyed into their dumb phones after calling a number to refill them.

There is plenty of feeling of community here.
You are couching your "suggestion" with weak language that implies that you just want to create a special post for those who want to celebrate milestones.
What you are really saying is that you want to change the behavior of others (through peer pressure or rules or whatever means) to get rid of what you view as objectionable posts celebrating milestones.  You want to delegate them to a hidden post where you don't have to look at them.
Obviously most of the community wants those posts.  That is evidenced by the fact that they are posted... and then voted up.
I'm actually surprised that your post was voted up.  Perhaps you do have a minority following who hate those posts based on that evidence.

You are a liar, but we have already established that.  Here is your very first email informing me that I had already been scammed and there was absolutely nothing that I could do about it:
The seller hasn't seen the payment on his/her account, and contacted us to resolve the situation.
If you marked the payment complete accidentally, and didn't execute the payment, please cancel the purchase at address: 
If you made the purchase, please contact the seller immediately at the URL below. Also supply us with all the possible evidence, such as screenshot from the payment, transfer id, etc. by replying to this message. Please also attach us your bank/payment provider contact information.
To contact the seller: 
Note: if you don't do anything in 24 hours, the bitcoins will be automatically returned to the seller.
That was your very 1st email.  Notice that you placed the burden of proof on me even though the bitcoins were supposedly in escrow and I was supposed to pay in cash in person to the seller.
There was no prior agreement that I was supposed to get a transfer id or bank involved or anything else.  The agreement was that the seller place the bitcoins in escrow (which he did).  Then we meet and I pay him cash (which I did).  Then the seller releases them from escrow (which he didn't do -- instead you released them back to him without my approval -- violating the very concept of escrow and helping the scammer complete the scam).
There is no way for me to prove that I paid in cash.  That was why we used escrow for the bitcoins.  That is the entire point of your claimed service.
If you hadn't lied about having escrow, there would be no way for the seller to get the bitcoins back so there would be no incentive to scam me.
But you lied about having escrow as evidenced in this email where you threatened to release the coins unilaterally without my approval back to the seller.
This is your actual email with the URLs x'd out.  It is not edited like your post which is a blatant lie.  This is what you claimed.  When I asked you if you were serious and planned to rip me off, you made it extremely clear that I was already ripped off and I couldn't do anything about it.  I couldn't even leave negative feedback.
Your comment claimed that you did offer to allow me to leave feedback after the case was resolved.  When I asked how, you sent this email:
Feedback can only be left on transactions that have been successfully completed.
That is the exact copy/paste of your email.
You lied about having escrow.  You stole the bitcoins out of escrow without my approval.  You refused to allow me to leave negative feedback against the seller who stole my $200.
That makes you a scammer.  Deal with it or change.  It's your choice.

My solution is what I'm doing.  To remind people that it is a fraud.  It is NOT what it claims to be.  The Bitcoin Foundation represents The Bitcoin Foundation and that is all it represents.  It does not represent bitcoin.

The Bitcoin Foundation is the biggest threat that bitcoin has faced, but bitcoin will succeed as long as enough others aren't tricked by your attempted fraud.

I swear there is no currency exchange on earth where you can exchange $5 without a significant fee of $1 or $2.
Nicaragua uses the cordova.  It is about 20 cordovas to the dollar.   It isn't even traded in any online exchange.  It is barely considered a real currency.  I'm pretty sure that BTC has passed it up in acceptance.
So how do you do currency exchange?  When you exit the airport or cross the land crossing there will be several young men yelling "cordovas, cordovas" and waving a stack of euros, dollars, colons and cordovas.
They literally have a hand held calculator that they use to calculate the exchange rate.  This is serious third world country stuff.
If you tried to hand one of them a $5 to get approximately 100 cordovas, the exchanger would laugh at you and walk away.
If you don't have at least $50 to exchange, you don't need to exchange currency.   That is true for any currency in the world  It is true when using Forex.com (unless you want to use up most of your currency with trade fees).  It is true when you go up to a counter in any major international airport and exchange currency.
That is just the way it works.
If Mt.GOX is to function as a currency exchanger, they don't need to handle coinage and small bills.   No other currency exchange for any currency on earth does.
Exchanging currency isn't spending.  You can spend 1 satoshi.  But if you are going to exchange dollars for BTC (or any other currency for any other currency), then you do it $100 at a time...  MINIMUM.
That is just the way currency exchange works.

GDP has nothing to do with the equation.  It stands for "gross domestic product."
It is a number that represents the amount of product that was produced by the United States (that's the domestic part).  The "gross" part means that expenses haven't been put in the equation yet.  Otherwise it would be "net domestic product."
It is equivalent (for the U.S.) to the total of all paychecks in the U.S.  If you take out the taxes and living expenses then you have "net pay" for the year.  If you add that to your total existing assets, then you have the total amount of money in the U.S.
What you need to compare with is this total amount of money in the U.S.   It is "net worth" if you were looking at an individual.   $1.6 billion is the equivalent "net worth" of bitcoin.
GDP is a meaningless number in this calculation.  Bitcoin has nothing to do with production.  You certainly can't get away with looking at the "gross" anything.  And the U.S. isn't the only market for bitcoin, so "domestic" is completely meaningless.

Income taxes don't pay for roads, schools, police, fire or anything else that you would consider "infrastructure" in the United States.  Property taxes collected by the county pay for all of those things.  Bitcoin will have no real effect on property taxation because the amount taxed is usually assessed based on the property which isn't affected at all by Bitcoin adoption.
Bitcoin adoption can and will affect income taxation in much the same way as the cash economy always has affected it.  It affects the ability of a government organization to measure your income independently of your claims on your income tax form.
Arguments about paying your income taxes because you use roads, schools, police and fire services are ignorant of the fact that income taxes don't pay for those things at all.
A review of what income taxes do pay for in the U.S. should make any rational, moral human being desire an opt-out.  Most rational, moral human beings also have a sense of self-preservation and the realization that the U.S. government is the most murderous organization on earth, so they may opt to pay income taxes anyway.  Taxation due to the later fear is unlikely to be affected much due to Bitcoin adoption.  The former reason is one to celebrate, not berate brave Americans for helping to improve the world in an extremely significant way by helping to increase adoption of Bitcoin.

1) I made arrangements to pay cash ($200) for bitcoins with a seller on LocalBitcoins.
2) The seller put the bitcoins in escrow per the agreement.
3) I paid the seller cash.
4) The seller played with his cell phone and then said he had to go.  He drove off.  I was fine with that because the bitcoins were in escrow.  I thought I could trust LocalBitcoins to let them rot in escrow if I he didn't approve their release.  That is how escrow works.
5) LocalBitcoins informed me that they were going to give the bitcoins back to the seller if I couldn't prove that I paid the cash.  There is no way to prove a cash payment.  That's ludicrous.  And escrow means they can't just unilaterally give the coins back to the seller.  That isn't escrow.
6) LocalBitcoins.com also claims to have a feedback system so you can report people who do this kind of thing and warn others so they don't get scammed (or alternatively praise them for a nice transaction).  They don't.  Instead they only allow positive feedback.
I use the word scam because it is a scam.  It is a standard bait and switch scam.  They claim escrow and a feedback system.  Both are false claims meant to make a potential mark feel confident that protections exist that really don't.
I use the word lie because they aren't telling the truth on their page about either of those things.  Not telling the truth is a lie.  I use the word fraud because... well... look it up.  I'm really just using English words for the purpose they are intended with the meaning that they have.

Do a little research.  The $100K - $1M per bitcoin are based on fundamentals after widespread adoption.
Your figures of $10M or $1T per bitcoin are certainly possible given the irresponsible nature of the government that prints the USD.  But if those numbers are attained, it will only be due to the USD being devalued by a factor of 10, 100 or 1,000.
In current USD, the numbers $100K/bitcoin represent widespread Internet adoption and fairly decent U.S. and other western country POS options.
The $1M/bitcoin would require world-wide adoption of the same magnitude.
Neither are pulled out of anyone's posterior.  Run the numbers yourself.  I have.

Us yacht owners don't really think of our community as a "shanty town" when we are rafted up or sharing a mooring field or anchorage.  We live quite well and the community is very strong.
Poop?  That isn't a problem at all at sea.  The currents and vastness of the ocean and ocean life cleans the area within seconds of flushing.  It is much more sanitary than land living in that respect.
Remember that there is a vast amount of ocean life (including whales... consider the size of their poop).  The sea knows how to deal with poop very efficiently.

The world just doesn't work in absolutes like that.
Zimbabwe's currency just collapsed if you want to read about that.  They were printing 100 trillion dollar notes (Zimbabwe dollars) in the end.
They still have wheelbarrows full of the stuff once almost everyone stopped accepting them.
But even then it's not 100%.  Some people actually figured out they could sell them on eBay.  I actually bought a 100 trillion dollar note on eBay.  I thought it was cool.  I think I paid $5 for it.
Others sold them for kindling.  Still others let the kids play a form of monopoly with them.   Some of the printings were on thin enough paper that people are rolling cigarettes with them.
Don't think in absolutes.  When the euro was introduced, it didn't actually consume all of the dutch kroners.  I saw them being used on the island of St. Martin years after the Netherlands joined the EU (St. Martin is half dutch held, but in the carib, not Europe).
I also saw that cigarette machines on street corners in rural Germany still accepted only marks long after Germany switched to the euro.  I assume they were still in limited circulation in that rural town since I saw people buy cigarettes from those machines with them.
If bitcoin completely destroys all of the currencies of the world (or makes them collectors items), that level of adoption is probably a couple decades in the future.
If that ever happens, then it will look like every other currency that has been abandoned... cigarette papers, kindling, collectors, etc.

You are correct that libertarianism doesn't forbid the creation of organizations that are funded by individuals.  Libertarianism forbids only the use of force or threat of force (or some would argue fraud).
You are also correct that the Bitcoin Foundation is simply an organization of individuals funded by individuals.
However, it is attempting a form of fraud (or at least many people are being defrauded) by this organization.  It pretends to own and control bitcoin which it does not.   However, because of that fraud (whether intentional or not), it does end up exerting a form of control that fraud usually exerts.
Many people do falsely believe that it is a controlling organization for bitcoin.  It is not.  It is a controlling organization only for itself.   Bitcoin is neither owned by Bitcoin Foundation, nor was it created by Bitcoin Foundation nor does Bitcoin Foundation represent bitcoin in any way whatsoever.
It's use of the word "bitcoin" along with an official sounding "Foundation" after it is obviously an attempt to convey otherwise.  Many would consider that fraud.
But most of all... what I actually said is "Any intelligent libertarian should recognize the attempts of others to form a governing body."
I stand by that statement.  If you claim to be an intelligent libertarian, you should certainly recognize this for what it is... an attempt by others to form a governing body.   Right now, it is by offering to "help" and only using a little bit of fraud.   Such endeavors never stop there though.  Those who believe in the right of some to govern others start in this way and slowly grow to fill their eventual goal of governing... by the threat of force... and force.

It really doesn't matter because the investment religion that uses the term (they call themselves "technical analysts") are completely ignored by the rest of the real investment community.
It is a "science" based on the flawed theory that it is possible to predict future trends based on the curves of past prices.  All of the "technical indicators" used decades ago by this cult-like religion were soundly proven to be false by using the scientific method in several studies decades ago.
It is amazing that there are still "technical analysts" out there throwing around such terms.
What they mean by "parabolic" is not the same as the mathematical term.  You can't express it as a formula.  Different sects of the technical analysts cult do have "indicators" that they use to predict a dramatic decrease in a stock or other security once it's rate of increase actually increases more than the rate of increase (sorry... that's a mouthful, but don't bother to understand it... remember that it has been proven false as a future indicator).
When these particular adherents to the "technical analysis" sect get together, they are known to use the term "parabolic" to describe the shape of the price curve over time when referring to the existence of this indicator.
Other "technical analysts" have other "indicators" that they use the slang term "parabolic" to describe.
It is all just meaningless drivel based on trying to predict the future based on past performance and it is been soundly proven several times to be useless.
The only possibly explanation for this religion continuing to exist is that you CAN see most of the "technical analysis" indicators in retrospect.  In other words, if you build a dataset from 2000-2010 and set your technical analysis indicators with that data, you CAN reliably predict 2006 prices based on 2005 data.

You shouldn't care at all except to note that an organization was formed with the intent of subverting bitcoin and turning it into a centralized mess controlled by them.
Many bitcoin users were duped (and still are duped) into believing that the Bitcoin Foundation somehow actually really does represent bitcoin (it doesn't of course... it is a pretend game they are playing -- fraud if you will... bitcoin is represented by algorithms and rules by 100% consensus, not some organization with a board.)
The OP was one of those bitcoin users who were duped into actually paying taxes voluntarily (by being a voluntary member) of the Bitcoin Foundation.  He is now declaring that he will no longer support the organization that is arguably the biggest threat to bitcoin that has existed to date.
Although his reason for resigning isn't that he now realizes that the Bitcoin Foundation is actually an enemy of bitcoin.  He is resigning because of an internal squabble between the directors of the Bitcoin Foundation.
Who cares?  I care a little.  I hate it when people actually spend resources in attempts to take away the freedoms of others.  The OP was doing that previously, but is now deciding to stop for whatever reason.  That is a good thing.

No.  Final number is based on world monetary supply as expressed in dollars vs number of bit coins which determines the exchange rate of any two currencies that are equally adopted.
Transaction amount isn't a variable in the exchange of any two currencies.  Gold is exchangeable at a rate based on the scarcity of gold vs the scarcity of the currency of exchange.  Almost zero transactions involve the use of gold.
Transaction volume is simply not a variable at all in a currency exchange rate.

Belize isn't good for establishing a community.
Nicaragua has plenty of self-sufficient, self-governed communities.  There are several near San Juan del Sur.  I've been to three of them.   They are all focused on living in harmony with nature and being renewable/self-sufficient.
In Nicaragua on the west coast side, you can't get way "out there."  For instance, the guy who claims to be Jesus running a very bizzare commune in Costa Rica would not be welcome on the west coast of Nicaragua, but just being private and self-governing is just fine.
The east coast of Nicaragua is literally lawless though.   There are some "way out" communes on that side.  It is an autonomous region so the Nicaraguan authorities will only get involved if the tribal elders ask them for help... and that has only happened once that I know of ever.
If you do the east coast, stay away from Bluefields.  Go up north to Las Perlas or down south to San Juan del Norte.   The garafuna chief in Las Perlas is a super nice guy and would be more than happy to help you out as long as you don't want to do anything to destroy the environment (he's big on protection of the environment).  
The Chief of the Garafuna's name is Vidale.  Tell him I said "Hi."  Tell him that I'm the one who had two little boys and brought news of Obama's 1st election to the Garafuna in Las Perlas.  He'll remember me.  He told me stories of just about every visitor their people have ever had back to 1975 or so (and he looks to be in his early 20s... go figure).
You might have a hard time getting to Las Perlas, but just try harder in Bluefields to get a ride.  You'll eventually figure out how it works.  It's pretty interesting.

It's actually an sha-256 of an sha-256.  And if you are talking about the "proof of work" part of mining, any vulnerability would have to:
1. Affect the 1st several bits since those are the ones that have to be zero.
2. Still exist after a double sha-256 hashing.
3. Would still only be selectively useful for faster mining in certain circumstances depending on specific conditions existing in the prior block (ie: the vulnerability would only be usable after certain blocks to get a mining advantage).
It would hardly cause Bitcoin to crash.  It might cause difficulty to increase.  And it might cause other miners to have to incorporate the "bug" to remain competitive.
It wouldn't affect ecdsa signed transactions in any way.  It wouldn't even allow a 51% attack because other miners could just incorporate the vulnerability and everything is back as it was (except each miner has to find one or two more zeros at the beginning of the hash).

I'm sure you have a spreadsheet.
Adoption rates are on a bell curve though.  As we approach saturation, the rate of increase starts to decrease to approach the top of the curve.
We sorta know the top of the curve.  It is at least $50K/bitcoin and more likely about $200K/bitcoin at the point of 51% grandparent adoption.
You can put that curve in too.  It will come out to about 6 years from now to reach that.
So, yes, you are right.  We start slowing down in rate of growth somewhere between $5K/bitcoin and $50K/bitcoin.   We can't get the shape of that curve until we get closer, but we can tell that we haven't entered it yet (and it wouldn't be possible to start entering it with that being the end game anyway).
That is actually one of the reasons I took us only to $2K.  It is well before the $5K where you might expect to see the rate of increase decreasing.
If you want to see the shape of that curve, you can go to alexa.com and get "siteinfo" on any site that experienced viral growth (almost all of the top 100 sites).

GDP is a yearly number.  It isn't comparable in any meaningful way with the total number of bitcoin.
It is comparable with the total world monetary supply which is $60 trillion dollars when denominated in U.S. dollars.
So absolute 100% market penetration (which I do NOT expect in the next 6-8 years... I expect only 51% grandparent adoption)... would actually lead to each bitcoin being worth between 3 and 5.5 million dollars (at the current value of the dollar).
GDP has to do with what is produced every year.  It has nothing to do with what exists.  You still have to subtract what is spent to get NDP and add that to get something like "world net worth" which is $60 trillion dollars currently.

That simply isn't true.  It isn't even true for most of the world today.  Two of the communities I have lived in during the last 10 years have no rule (nor ability) to drive on separate sides of the road.
In addition, Roman roads have grooves in them from the wheels of the chariots.  We can see that chariots going both directions used the center of the road because of those grooves.
People generally drove in the middle of the road before 1903 in the United States.  Most roads were only one lane wide so it wasn't even possible to drive on a "side" of the road.
Some of the United States started driving on the right side of the road since after 1903 due to "Rules of the Road" being written and published by a private party (not government... and it had no force of law whatsoever... in fact, it was quite controversial).
There were no laws requiring anyone to even be licensed to drive a car until 1935.  Traffic laws came later.  But there wasn't even a tradition of driving on the right side until introduced in 1903 with a publication that didn't have the force of law.
Obviously the United States was formed in 1776 by British.  The British completely separately decided on the left side of the road later than even the U.S.  No laws existed (nor traditions even) prior to that time.
If there had been rules or traditions in 1776, then the United States would be the same as the U.K. because those traditions would have been adopted by the same people.  There weren't.
The idea that a community needs to decide on which side of the road to travel on is quite new with the advent of the automobile and people moving into cities.
Less than half of the world lives in communities that have such rules.  As I mentioned, I have lived in two of those communities.  It would have been quite impossible for us to adopt such a silly tradition in those two communities because there was no room for opposing lane.
You are quite wrong to suggest that such rules are thousands of years old.  History records no such thing.  It records exactly the opposite.  People quite rationally used the center of roads until very recent times.
People drive on the left side of the road in the U.K. currently.  People drive on the right side of the road in the U.S. currently.  Both co-exist.
In fact, France drives on the right side of the road and borders the U.K. and has highways connecting the two countries.  Both co-exist just fine.
Just as Litecoin and Bitcoin co-exist just fine.

One scenario is that your password was actually not very secure at all.  It may have been one of the 62,000 most common passwords in use.
If that had been the scenario, then I would have been able to just look up your address and tell you your private key and brainwallet passphrase.
It turns out that is NOT the case.  Your address is not one generated using the brain wallet algorithm to generate a privkey/pubkey pair.
I have a rainbow table of those that I generated and just checked it to see if it was in that table.  It is NOT.
So I can't tell you what did happen, but I can tell you that it wasn't from using a password that is actually one of the 62,000 most common passwords.
Edit: I read that you used BrainWallet and didn't notice that you gave a URL that is NOT BrainWallet.  That URL is fishy as heck.  So is the code which is NOT Javascript.

Does marijuana still work even though it is outlawed?
Would a hammer still work even if it was outlawed?
Do people drive a bit faster than the posted speed limit even though it is outlawed?
In fact, there are very few laws that people follow just because they are laws.  In generally people just follow common sense and the consensus of what is right and wrong.
There are a few exceptions.  If a law is aggressively enforced (like seat belts and helmets or IRS taxation at times), then people will follow a law that is aggressively published and enforced to avoid the penalties.
In general, most people have no idea what the law even entails.  In the U.S., most people are theoretically subject to a book the size of Moby Dick full of county or city ordinances.  They are also subject to an entire bookcase full of books of state statutes.   In addition, there is another entire bookcase full of books of federal statutes.
I don't know of anyone who has read them, much less memorized them.  That's silly.
Even if someone did actually read the laws that apply to them and memorized them, they would find:
1) There are tons of conflicting laws and it actually isn't even possible to follow all of the laws at the same time due to conflicts in those laws.
2) There are tons of departments that have been authorized by those statutes to create even more rules that have the force of law.  Trying to read all of them in a life time is impossible.
3) The statutes aren't even absolute in accepting them on their face value.  They are interpreted by court rulings.  To understand any one statute, you have to read all of the case law about it.  You then have to gamble on what future courts will decide about it.
Even police officers generally carry only about 1/10th of the criminal code, 1/10th of the vehicle code, and 0.1% of the health and safety code with them in their vehicles for reference.
Those codes represent less than 1% of the statutes that exist and they only have a tiny part of each of those codes.
That means that even the law enforcers have only a tiny portion of the statutes available to even reference.  I guarantee you that most LEOs don't even read the entire peace officer abridged statutes that they have for reference.
Outlawing something has almost no effect on the average populace.

Only a control freak would be concerned about trying to "prevent such a world from slipping into complete chaos."
Nobody has the moral authority to prevent any such thing if that is what individuals decide they want.
Genocide is only possible if:
1) You find a group of people who agree with you and want to experience the joys of being exterminated and therefore join your "genocide" fork as the proposed victims.   Not likely.
2) A war between forks is declared.  Each political philosophy (and therefore the fork defending against the genocide attempt) has their own answer to such a war.  Limited government libertarians defend with their army.  Anarchists defend individually.  Pacifists voluntarily die.  Socialists of each variety have their own answer to war.
There is no way to avoid evil.  Evil exists.  There are only ways to defend against it.  Those ways are quite varied among the various existing ideologies.

I was a regular part of the community of other people who live aboard, cruise, transport cargo, engage in commercial fishing, etc.  I never heard of a single incident of a Somalian pirate even being sited, much less causing trouble.
There are zero news reports world-wide of Somalian pirates ever even being seen in over 90% of the world's ocean.
BTW.  Somalia is a land geography.  If you are afraid to live at sea, then you should consider that most of the time those Somalian pirates are actually on land.  You should actually be more afraid of living on land since those Somalian pirates might decide to skip getting in their boat and just come get you by land.

The monetary base is well known.  If it weren't known, you could always calculate it based on the known amount of gold in the world and the exchange rate of whatever currency you were evaluating against gold.
The available monetary base of Bitcoin is even better defined.  It is currently a bit over 11 million BTC.
Once BTC is traded openly on major Forex sites (full adoption) and recognized by the average person as a world currency (full adoption), the exchange rate is already known (unless they print even more dollars in which case the exchange rate against dollars will be even higher).
I know you probably have never watched a new currency being born.  But I have and many other people my age and even much younger have.  It's just math.
If there are 10,000,000,000 USD in the world (a made up number) and a new currency is created to cover all of Africa and Asia and they decide to create only 10,000,000 of Afrasias, then the exchange rate will be 1000 dollars to 1 Afrasia once the Afrasia is traded on major Forex exchanges and recognized globally as a currency.

Like most people, I associate with many different societies.  Let me list how a few would deal with someone becoming violent:
1. Disfellowshipment or ex-communication.  Basically banishment unless or until they apologize and make things right (pay for the costs incurred by the victim, etc).
2. Firing if an employee.  Removal from the board if a board member.
3. Not doing business or associating any longer with the violent party.
4. A generally shunning that would cause them to feel unwelcome and leave the community.
If I was a potential victim of violence, I would either defend or leave that society myself (ie: self banishment).
But as I mentioned, I don't associate with any societies who practice violence (other than the relatively safe conversation on Reddit with people like you).  So violence really isn't a part of my life.
Unfortunately that is a problem you created for yourself when you practiced violence (either by voting, using a court system, choosing to live among violent people, using a violent police force or otherwise associating with violent people and practicing violence yourself).
Your problem with worrying about being the victim of violence was caused by your association with and use of violence.  Change the societies you associate with to those who abhor violence and you will have one less thing to worry about.

We can objectively say that the true exchange rate of bitcoin is much higher than the currently claimed rate on Mt. Gox though.
How?  We know that Mt.Gox and the other exchanges can't keep up with purchases.  There is a backlog for purchases.  There is no backlog for selling.
We can also look at places where individuals sell to individuals.  It is clearly a sellers market.
The price is currently understated dramatically.  And there is no solution in site (yet... I do expect there to be... I trust market forces).   So the current bottleneck is artificially causing exchanges to report a lower number than the real market value.
That real market value is why bitcoin physical coins on ebay are selling for over $1,000.  It is why local bitcoin sellers are selling for $550/bitcoin (too bad they don't realize how discounted they actually are right now).
There is a very easy way to objectively see what is real.

The biggest real threat is technical.  The protocol isn't quite robust enough to handle large scale (ie: $1 trillion dollar equivalency) and above transaction rates.
That technical challenge WILL be addressed somehow and it probably WON'T be addressed directly with Bitcoin.  The risks to fragmenting Bitcoin would be too great and consensus can't be reached on some of the technical issues.
The result is that Bitcoin will probably end up being useful only for larger, less frequent transactions and something else will be built on top of it or alongside it to handle the pooling of those larger, less frequent transactions.
It can't be killed except by hard forking repeatedly with in-fighting.  One or two instances of that will likely lead most people to adopt a "just leave it alone" attitude which will save it, but lead to it being useful for only larger, less frequent transactions.
BTW, most people haven't considered that no action at all would have been just fine during the last bug related hard-fork situation.   More and more of those situations will lead people to realize that "leaving it alone" is the default and best option.

Where did this happen?
On LocalBitcoins.com
What is the seller's name/username/email address?
LocalBitcoins.com is anonymous.  They don't give out seller or buyer names or email addresses.
Have you asked the seller why they didn't release the BTC?
I don't have any contact information for the seller.  LocalBitcoins.com deleted my account after this incident.
Have you made a police report?
No.  LocalBitcoins.com is located in another country and this is a civil matter.  I voluntarily gave $200 to someone I don't even know and LocalBitcoins either gave the seller back his coins or kept them for themselves.  It's like ordering something on Amazon and it never arriving.  There is no crime.   It's a civil matter.
Do you have any reason to think that Localbitcoins is somehow related to the seller, or is your complaint about them that the escrow/feedback system didn't work the way you expected?
The latter except that it isn't about expectations.  It is about claims on the LocalBitcoins.com site that are blatantly false.   They don't have an escrow system.  They don't allow negative feedback.
Of course I responded to the e-mails that LocalBitcoins sent me.  I wasted three hours of my life trying to get them to keep their original agreement with me.  They refused on both accounts.  They took the bitcoins from escrow.  They refused to allow me to post negative feedback about what happened.

They give you 24 hours to proof you paid the cash.  If you can't prove it (and nobody can) they give the bit coins back to the seller.
When you ask about how to leave negative feedback, the inform you that is only for "completed" transactions.

But you don't need anything near full adoption to be fully exchangeable.
Most Americans have never adopted the Euro in any way.  Most Europeans have only adopted the dollar in very tiny ways.  Most Europeans have also adopted the Swiss Franc in very limited ways.
But all three are 100% exchangeable (along with gold which has an extremely low actual adoption rate for use as a currency).  To be 100% exchangeable just means that a vast majority of people know the currency exists (whether they use it or not) and that it be easily exchangeable on the world's major forex markets.
That's it.  That is the 100% adoption rate where the math works as an exchangeable currency.  There actually is no % adoption rate.  Every currency wasn't really a currency one day and was a currency the next day.  Many of us watched that with the Euro.
What we are seeing now is simply the equalization of correct exchange rates as Bitcoin moves from not truly being a currency (today) to being a fully exchangeable and recognizable currency (probably by the end of this year at the current idea virus adoption rate.
So we have to get from $100 on April 1 to $100,000 - $5.5 million by the end of the year if that is the case (or possibly by mid-year 2014 if things slow down dramatically or some major problem is uncovered making it appear that Bitcoin might not be suitable as a currency.)
We are on the adoption curve, but the tipping point in this case is fairly binary.  One day it isn't truly a currency.  The next day it is.  As a currency, it has to exchange north of $100K by simple math.  Otherwise the equalization that we currently see as it approaches currency status will have to continue at an extremely rapid rate until the correct exchange rate is attained.

I gave one.  There are people who are currently lobbying to get the 1mb hard block limit increased with bitcoin.  They disagree with the current consensus.
They have two choices.
1) They can convince 100% of bitcoin users to support the change and upgrade to the version the developers create because they also agreed with the 100% consensus.
2) Get enough people to agree that it is worth a fork.  Now they just download the current source code and make the change.  They now join Bitcoin2 and those who disagreed stay on the Bitcoin fork.
That's reality.  I'm not proposing that.  That is just the way it is.  That is a real disagreement and those are the real choices that exist for humans who don't resort to violence.
I suppose there are other choices available for those who do resort to violence:
1. Use a political vote to justify violence.  If people refuse to obey 51% of those who decided to "vote", they will send the police to their homes to force them to use the Bitcoin2 client.
2. Make threats of violence.  Threaten to do  or to just skip  and threaten to directly use violence without a vote to force people to change.
3. Just do the change and then track down IPs who are still supporting Bitcoin1 and kill them or destroy their computers (ie: war).
That is how any disagreement is handled.

If you try to take $100K in cash out of the country, you WILL be caught at the airport.  Not only does it look like plastic explosive on the x-ray, but there are also specific sensors for amount of money as you go through security.
On the other hand, you can easily take $100K worth of bitcoin out of the country.  A thumb drive or a piece of paper is all you need.  Or you can just take your laptop with the Bitcoin-qt client installed.  No problem.  There is nothing they can sense.
Catching people at the exchanges?  Why don't they do that for cash money laundering?  The reason is that money laundering is the process of making dirty money "clean."  It is just as easy to do with Bitcoin as it is to do with cash.  It works something like this:
1. You earn dirty money selling drugs or human trafficking or whatever.
2. You open an ice cream shop.
3. You claim on paper that your ice cream shop is extremely successful and earns $1,000 per day in sales (it actually does $100/day in sales).
4. You deposit the $1,000 each day in the bank as the proceeds of the ice cream store.
5. $900 per day of dirty money is now successfully laundered.
The process of money laundering is exactly the same with Bitcoin or cash.  They are both very similar instruments in that regard.
However, Bitcoin is vastly superior for moving value across national boundaries without being detected.

I have already told you what to do wrong several times in public.  It has nothing to do with my account.  It is your POLICY to LIE and commit FRAUD against EVERYONE.
1. You claim to offer an escrow service on your site.   You LIE.  It is NOT an escrow service at all.  It is a way for you to arbitrarily help scammers.  An escrow system wouldn't allow something in escrow to be removed from escrow either direction without agreement of the parties in question.  It is designed to stop scammers.  Scammers can not ever profit if a true escrow system is in place because what they would have gained will simply be tied up in escrow forever.   You do NOT have an escrow system.  You have a system where you give scammers back the bitcoins they put in escrow AFTER they have been paid for them in cash.  That is simply a SCAM, not escrow.
2. You claim you offer further protection by allowing victims of scams to post negative feedback.  It is a blatant LIE.  You refuse to allow negative feedback claiming that the transaction wasn't "successfully completed."  Well... duh!  That is why negative feedback is being submitted!
Why would you need me to give you my purchase ID to confirm these two things?  You know they are true.  You know you deliberately LIE to every single potential customer.  You know you deliberately protect scammers with your policies.   What does my purchase ID have to do with anything?
In any case, you have it.   I gave it in public so that everyone can see that you are a liar and scammer.  Don't pretend to be a regular honest company trying to improve your procedures.  You have two procedures that are completely dishonest and designed to scam people.

Maybe.  I was trying to imagine how that would happen too.  Italy is mentioned.  The EU has no borders anymore between EU countries.
I haven't kept up since my last visit to Switzerland, but they weren't part of the EU the last time I visited (about the time UBS was going to turn over all account holder's names to the U.S.).  There was no border check (at least on the train) when I crossed.
Three or four years before that, there was a border check, but it was extremely casual.  The Italian police boarded the train and asked for passports.  I gave them a driver's license from a latin american country. they pretended to be annoyed for a bit and finally a police supervisor asked me if I was American.  I said "yes" and they moved on.   (Yes. I had a couple of passports I could have shown, but I like to see holes in systems so I try odd things on occasion... no... the driver's license wasn't fake.  It was MY driver's license granted by the latin american country it said it was from.)
I've never driven across the Swiss/Italy border, but I really can't imagine that there is even a stop point.  The Italian police might stop entering cars with a pull over on rare occasion, but I doubt there is a place where you have to stop and check into Italy.  It is just too busy of a border and everyone understand that it is silly to treat Switzerland different than the rest of Europe.
So... how the heck did this even happen?
Is there another news source that even verifies that they were entering Italy from Switzerland?  Why did they decide to check that car so thoroughly?  Maybe it was riding low or something.

I think seasteading concepts require sailing for some parts (to be self-sufficient).  If you were in the Navy, you didn't likely actually learn to sail.
Other parts require fixed platformed or decommissioned ships that are moored or anchored.  They don't need a captain.  They don't move.
A captain's license might be helpful to get pharmaceuticals for the sickbay/seastead hospital or clinic.  But anyone checking in even the smallest sea craft in just about any country other than the U.S. can use their checkin paperwork to prove they are a "captain" even if they don't have a captain's license.

Actually increases (or decreases) are better expressed as percentages rather than absolute dollar increases per day.
So you actually start out a but slower than $14-$15 per day to get there.  Right now, you would expect more like $5-$6 per day.  That percentage (5%) ends up meaning many more dollars per day rise toward the end of the time period.

It's hard to sell a $100K diamond necklace.  That completely defeats the goal of transporting something outside the country of origin to do the money laundering in another country.
You end up buying a $100K diamond necklace which will trigger the $10K IRS forms and a money laundering investigation in the source country.
Not to mention that diamonds are actually worthless.  You have to be in the cartel to sell diamonds at the artificial rate that diamonds apparently cost.  You can't sell them back at even a fraction of that rate.
Try it.  Go buy a diamond.  Go along with the best diamond expert you can find to appraise it.  Now try to sell it for anything more than 10% what you paid for it.

There isn't much to tell.  Look up the situation in each country.
Nicaragua has lots of gold, but mining stopped by big companies long ago due to political instability caused by u.s. meddling.  So there is lots of gold panned by farmers in rural areas.  They are scared of Managua, so they wait for buyers to come through their area.  Managua is a dangerous place to sell gold and you can only get spot minus 15% or so.
Costa Rica is eco friendly and doesn't mine much to protect their environment.  They also have a 100% import duty on gold.  So you can sell gold above spot by about 3%.
Rarely does Costa Rica check bags for walk across entry at that border.  When they do, you stand in line and push a button.  A green light or a red light turns on.  If red, you pick a bag, but customarily you would pick the largest bag to have checked.
Or you can just skip the line and probably nobody would notice.  I often did.  Or when picked, you hand the inspector your passport with a 10 mil note inside and get some first class treatment.
Or you just show the gold and they explain the import duty.  You explain that you haven't taken your foreigner exemption in the last six months.  You fill out the exemption paperwork and enter.  Or you apologize and say you can't afford the duty tax so you'll take the gold back to Nicaragua.

It is arbitrary really.  Adoption has no real beginning nor ending (unless every single person on earth adopted something... even then you would have to look at level of penetration).
So I'm looking at total value of market captured from the time of the 1st true launch (the viral campaign that actually went viral) to the point where the average grandparent has an account (or a wallet in this case).
We are very roughly at about the same phase in that adoption path as PayPal was just a couple months after I got my 1st account.  It was about 1% of their way to full market penetration if you define full market penetration as the point where the average grandparent has an account.
It is admitted very loose numbers, but I am getting to be an old man now.  I have had the privilege of seeing this same thing several times.  I watched the desktop computer adoption rate from nearly the beginning.  I watched the Internet adoption rate from nearly the beginning (not the true beginning of course, but the commercial Internet).
All of those things and many others have taken approximately the same path.   I recognize that bitcoin is on that path and at about the point that I arbitrarily call 1% because it is about 1/100th of the way from going viral to grandparent adoption.
BTW, the really exciting thing is that 100% is only about 6 years.  That means we'll be at 15% or somewhere in that neighborhood in about a year.  Calculate those numbers!

In a pyramid scheme, one is asked to artificially create a virus by lying to at least two other people and asking them to do the same.  The money is passed up until the pyramid collapses (people detect the lie or you run out of gullible population).  Those at the top have the money of those at the bottom who lost it.  It is a zero sum game.
This is just viral growth.  For a virus, it allows for rapid procreation.
For the Internet, it allows the idea of a global method of exchanging information via packets to become a reality.
For Bitcoin, it allows the idea of a better currency to become one.
Viral growth does not equal pyramid scheme although pyramid schemes are virally grown.
There is nothing about bitcoin that is a pyramid scheme.  It isn't taking from some to give to others.  It is providing true value as a better currency than those which currently exist.

Actually that is exactly how adoption works.  One person tells two friends who tell two friends, etc.
There is no way for bitcoin to reach the expected target of a $100K-$5.5million exchange rate in the next couple of years that it will take to fully adopt without doubling at an astounding rate until it gets to the halfway point (where it will start slowing down to form the top part of the adoption curve where it levels off at full adoption).
Run the numbers.  From a $100 at the start of April 2013 to a $100K at the start of April 2014, you have to have to double about every month.  Since the 2nd half of the curve has to be slowing down, you actually have to exceed that rate (ever increasing) until the half-way point.
The current rate of adoption actually shows the half-way adoption point in mid-June which makes the full adoption before the end of the year.
We've seen these growth rates with most new technologies in the last couple of years.  The only difference is that we don't get to see the exponential growth rate that occurs BEFORE the IPO for most of these technologies.  We do get to see it with Bitcoin because it is a currency and will not ever need to IPO (nor could it).

I don't think Zimbabwe has another currency since their collapse.  Euros and dollars are in general use there among ex-pats, hotels, restaurants and other services.
The locals have pretty much dropped back to barter in most cases.
I'm talking about third world countries that claim to actually have their own currency and it is still used in that country, but not traded on Forex... such as the Nicaraguan Cordova.
It also applies to currencies that are traded internationally.  It doesn't matter if you are dealing with kids at the border or a nice counter at an airport or online with a Forex site.  You don't exchange currency unless you have the equivalent of $100 or more to exchange.  It just isn't done.

I have literally traveled the world in the last five years and have a fairly high net worth (definitely a 1%er).  I haven't had a car in at least five years.   It isn't because I can't afford a car.  It is simply because a car is not a necessity in any way whatsoever.  I have no idea why anyone would count a car as a "necessity."
Most people in the silicon valley get to work by train, muni or bus.  Most people in New York get to work by subway or taxi.  Once you get outside the United States (which is the most car worshiping country in the world), the necessity for a car becomes almost nil.
Bicycles are only one solution.  Most countries have trains, buses, trams, taxis and numerous other ways to get around.

I have given you more than three hours of my life trying to explain how you are scammers.   I'll try one more time:
1. Lying is wrong.  Lying is saying something that isn't true.  When you tell people that you have an escrow service and you actually don't, that is a lie.  You aren't telling the truth.  The word "escrow" has a definition.  You can't just unilaterally take something out of "escrow" because you want to help out a scammer.  That isn't "escrow" as the entire rest of the world describes escrow.  What you did is to lie and to steal.  Both of those things are wrong.
2. You then made it worse by agreeing with the scammer to try to cover up for your crime and their crime.  You lied again.  Your site claims that further protection is offered because scammers can be revealed with negative feedback.  That is a lie.  You don't actually allow negative feedback.  When you help a scammer rip someone off, you protect yourself and them by not allowing negative feedback with the lame excuse that "the transaction wasn't completed."   In other words, you are saying "we aren't allowing you to leave negative feedback because we ripped you off and we want to rip off other people."  That is wrong.
In addition to being wrong, it will earn you negative feedback where you can't control it.  Out here on the public Internet.  You can't control that.
Deal with it.
If you don't like being called a scammer, then stop scamming.  It is that easy.
Everyone else sees how an actual escrow system would have completely kept the bitcoin seller from scamming me.   Everyone else sees that it was only possibly because YOU conspired in the scam by stealing the bitcoins from escrow.
Everyone else sees how a real feedback system (that also allows negative feedback) would have crippled the scammer's ability to scam other people.  But you conspired to cover up their crime.
Those are just the facts.  Deal with it or change.  It's your choice.

As you can see in your link, adoption curves are very diverse.  But there is some commonality in them.
The commonality in them would make your idea that the current trend could continue for more than four months from now seem extremely unlikely.  All adoption curves have to put the breaks on as they approach saturation.  It isn't possible to overshoot saturation.  It is based on the physical world and physical constraints (ie: the number of people who are eligible to adopt said technology to the depth of their possible engagement with said technology).
I said $1,000 in the next 60 days because the current trend doesn't approach a braking point nor does the target price force braking.  The current rate gets to that price in 45 days or so.  That is why the headline is "Why $1,000 in 60 days... a PayPal comparison."
That chart just extends last month by a month which may or may not be reasonable +/- a couple of percent.  Who knows?
You can't pretend that a viral spread will never level out though so you can't pretend that a viral spread rate will continue at early rates of infection right up past the saturation point.
We know the saturation point (within an order of magnitude or so... $100K - $5.5 million).   We know where we are in that saturation ($140 or so).  We know the current rate of viral infection (5% last month).
We can expect similar viral infection rates to at least $1,000.  We can't expect the same to $25,000 or $100,000 though because the curve has to level out to approach saturation.

Within a single community, can we have people driving on both the left and right hand side of the road?
Yes.  Of course you can.  Try it yourself.  Drive down your community street on the opposite side of what your delusion tells you is impossible.
Now if you actually chose an example that would force a community split, then that is the outcome... a community split.  Your example doesn't force a community split though.  There is certainly no reason people can't drive down their own road on the left, right or center.  There is no reason they can't do the same on a shared community road.  The only time there is any conflict at all is if there happens to be another driver who chooses otherwise.  Such a conflict is easily resolved without laws or community splits.
You do realize that there haven't been laws regarding which side of the road to drive on forever; don't you?  There was a time when people drove on community roads on whichever side they chose.  That is why some countries drive on a different side than other countries.  There is no objective truth about which side of the road is proper for driving.  It is just a choice.
Do you have to divorce your spouse because they like a different kind of music than you do?  Of course not.  You are being silly.
How can two people in a single household co-exist if one believes toilet paper should be hung over and the other believes it should be hung under?  No laws need exist.  No rules need exist.  It isn't a community decision that requires a split.  They can co-exist because they can... and do co-exist.

Rogue waves are rogue.  You don't know when they are coming.  You don't have time to get in any kind of escape vessel and it would be foolish to try.  The  rule of surviving a sea disaster is that you must step UP into your life raft.  If you aren't stepping UP into it, then you should be staying on your main boat.  It is safer.
No.  I wouldn't ride out a rogue wave in a life raft.  I would ride it out right on my sea going craft where I live and already am when it happens.  Sea going craft experience rogue waves periodically throughout their designed life of decades and that is where you should remain even if you notice a rogue wave 30 seconds before it hits you.  It's standard seamanship and I've been through several rogue waves.
If you are under sail or power (rather than anchored, moored or docked), then you would also turn your bow to point at the oncoming wave.  This is true for non-rogue waves during a storm as well.

Carlos Slim (richest man in the world at one point... and quite a bit richer than Bill Gates) created the most popular developing world cell phone system and the payment model.  You end up paying from $0.001 to $0.01 per minute depending on the country.
An SMS is one minute.  So the surcharge to send money via SMS is a maximum of 1 cent.  Receiving SMS (or phone calls) costs nothing.  You can still receive calls even if you have used up all of your pre-paid funds.  You can also still receive SMS, so you can receive money to replenish your funds.
Source: I have lived in third world countries for most of the last five years and bought at least a dozen of these cheap cell phones and learned how to use their system to refill minutes/money and send money to other cell phones, etc.

Possibly, but adoptions are a bell curve with a relatively flat top.
As mentioned in the body of this post, the target could be as low as $100,000 at the point of 51% grandparent adoption which would be expected in 2-4 years from now.  
You have to have a slowing in the rate of change long before $100,000 for it to level out at $100,000.   Maybe you get to $8,000 without hitting that deceleration curve, but I don't see how you can hit $35,000 two months after that.
You have to understand where we are going and the shape of the curve that viral adoption rates always take.

I got ripped off by LocalBitcoins.com.  They claim to have escrow.  The Bitcoins were supposedly in escrow.
But the guy takes my cash and starts to push some buttons on his phone.  Says it is taking to long to send and then hops in his car and drives away.
No problem.  Bitcoins are in escrow; right?
Wrong.  LocalBitcoins is a scam.  They gave the $200 back to the scammer and refused to let me leave negative feedback because "the transaction wasn't successfully completed."
Bitcoins are like cash.  You have to be careful.  That's just the way it is.  Don't trust companies like LocalBitcoins.com (or any other company) with your cash.  Don't trust individuals.
I can walk away from $200.  I hope you can walk away from $80.  I would have probably done the same in your case.  It's just $80 so no need for a contract, escrow or any of that other nonsense.  Only a few people are scum bags.  You'll eventually run into one or two, but most people are decent and honest especially with small amounts of money like $80 or $200.

It isn't a huge assumption to believe that Satoshi:
1) Valued privacy and anonymity.
2) Distrusted government.
Those are pretty core things that actually lead to the creation of Bitcoin and are included in tons of his writings.
Are you assuming that Satoshi wouldn't have minded Gavin speaking to the CIA?  Gavin assumed that Satoshi disappeared because his planned to speak to the CIA.  Do you think Gavin made the wrong assumption?

LocalBitcoins is a SCAM!
I used their escrow to buy bitcoins.  The seller put it in escrow.  I felt comfortable giving them the $200 cash.  They just drove away.
I thought "no problem", it's in escrow.
LocalBitcoins then contacted me to say the seller claimed they hadn't been paid and wanted me to release the bitcoins from escrow.  I told them that wasn't true and that I had paid in cash.  If those bitcoins rotted in escrow forever, that was fine, but I didn't want the scammer to be paid.
LocalBitcoins said they were siding with the seller unless I had a receipt or other proof that I had paid in cash.  Of course I didn't.  I lost that $200.
I then asked how to leave negative feedback.  LocalBitcoins said they only allow feedback to be left on "successfully completed transactions."
DO NOT USE LOCALBITCOINS.COM.  They are a scam.  Their escrow isn't even close to the actual concept of escrow.  They actively help scammers and they profit from helping scammers.  They actively keep negative feedback from being left about scammers.
In short, THEY are a scam!

It is an important lesson for a someone new.   I absolutely believe the core bitcoin protocol is absolutely solid.  I have studied the code and the design.  I'm a qualified software engineer with some cryptography background.  Bitcoin is good stuff.
Many of the early adopting companies are having a lot of issues though. Some just have a hard time keeping up with growth.  They fail miserably at times.  Coinbase comes to mind.  But Coinbase has dealt with everything in a very honest and straight forward manner.  In the end, I have never lost a penny due to Coinbase having issues.
There are many others (like LocalBitcoins.com) that simply aren't honest.  They don't even have a clue that they don't have a clue about what honesty even entails.
If this is going to continue to grow, we have to be a tight community.  We have to warn others about companies like LocalBitcoins.com.  We even have to warn others about the kinds of problems Coinbase.com had with delays (while being as accurate as possible so that good companies can survive honest issues).
That's just reality.  We need to help each other out with solid, real information while this thing is a toddler or it will become known for it's shady companies and a community that tolerates dishonesty.  If that happens, we all lose.

Communities are just groups of individuals interacting.
There are thousands of seasteading communities all over world.
As you say, seasteaders hate the concept of government and avoid most contact (other than as required) with nations.   Existing seasteaders would avoid an "xnation" like the plague.   The existing seasteading communities generally thrive where the nearby "nations" are tolerant of the seasteading communities and generally leave them alone.
Seasteading communities currently exist as adults in free cooperation with each other.  Services such as laundry, bottom cleanings, fresh water and fuel tank top-offs, water taxis and other things are offered on a VHF frequency that is generally publicized during a morning 'net that is generally publicized.
People also announce things they need or things they are offering during such a 'net.   They also attempt to organize weekly get togethers like pizza night or book exchanges.  Everything is voluntary though.  Only those who want what you are trying to organize show up.  There is no force.  There is no government.  There is no "nation."
Just us free adults acting in voluntary social community with each other.  Kinda like Reddit, in fact... but on Reddit people often babble about nations and government and voting and other such nonsense.  Out in the real world among seasteaders, such babble is generally taken very negatively and the person proposing such nonsense often feels a bit shunned as people avoid them to the extent that they propose such nonsense.

Police in the U.S. aren't obligated to do anything at all.  There is even a Supreme Court ruling on that.
You aren't likely to ever get help from the police in the U.S.  You are fairly likely to get tased yourself or thrown in jail if you call them as a victim.  It's just their way of educating the public.
Even before the police became extremely corrupt in the U.S. (and the U.S. became a third world country), you wouldn't get help from the police on this matter.
They would have simply told you that it was a civil matter, not a criminal matter.  There was no crime committed here under any state's laws in the U.S.  It wasn't a "strong arm robbery."  The "victim" admitted that he voluntarily sent the bitcoin without there being any threat or physical force.
Also, the headphones weren't in the "victim's" possession so he can't allege a strong arm robbery there.
There was no theft at all.  It was a civil matter.  It is a clear case for the "victim" as a civil matter, but it simply isn't a criminal matter at all.

I have lived where there are only private roads (paid for by those living along a road or the businesses that desire a road for more business).   It's just fine.  Perhaps they are of slightly lower quality, but they are of the quality that the owners of them desired and paid to have.  It is a fallacious argument to say you NEED government or roads would not exist.  Roads existed long before governments decided to take them over.  They exist today in many places without government.
Most of the U.S. is actually serviced by volunteer firefighters.  County governments pretend to have control over them (but the IRS never provides a single penny for firefighters anywhere in the U.S.).  Firefighting also existed long before governments decided to "help" us.  Most people in the U.S. have a volunteer fire fighting service that works just fine without even property tax expenditures.
Military seems to be a no brainer.  It's not.  Costa Rica has no military.  Guns are ubiquitous though and even Columbus was unable to enslave the indigenous population there which had no military when he arrived in 1502.  Now the population is mostly Spaniard, but it still has no military whatsoever.   When Nicaragua sent military troops to occupy an island that belonged to Costa Rica, the government sent up some police officers to check it out.  They realized that no Costa Ricans were being affected by the incursion, so they decided to protest to the U.N. and basically ignore the matter other than that.   If Nicaragua has sent troops where Costa Rican citizens would be affected, I am quite sure Costa Ricans would have taken care of the problem.  They did once before.  Government is not needed for a defensive military.  People will band together naturally for the common good if invaded.   Where no military exists, it is actually very difficult for a military to invade.  They have to conquer every individual in the area rather than just taking over the government military forces and government buildings.
I see no reason to shame a person for paying their taxes in order to avoid government violence against them or their family.

Hundreds of trades of BTC 0.02 by a single party does constitute:
1) Legitimate trade.
2) Overwhelming the exchange resulting in symptoms very much like a DDOS attack.
The solution is quite easy and nobody would give it a second thought on any other exchange.  You either:
1) Establish a minimum amount per trade.
- or -
2) Establish a minimum commission amount per trade regardless of the size of the trade.
If you are buying or selling less than 1 BTC, then why are you even using an exchange?

To say that a member opinion doesn't reflect on the "Foundation" is not tenable as a libertarian concept even.  That is collectivist thought.

They already have something which is very similar to bitcoin and works via SMS.
In africa, they send payments to each other via SMS menus using a system called m-pesa.
In latin America, they buy pre-paid cards in tiny neighborhood stores (there is at least one within a block of anyone everywhere).  You scratch off the back of the card to reveal the private key.  You enter the private key to add money to your phone.
That "money" is then available for both cell phone minutes (about a penny a minute) or can be sent between phones to use as cash.  You can even go into one of those small stores that exist everywhere and sell back some of your phone money for paper money.
Of course it is centralized, but since Carlos Slim (the richest man in the world and a Latino) created it along with their most popular cell phone system... they trust it.  So far, his trust has been earned.
So the only thing that would push them toward bitcoin is the international aspects of bitcoin.  Although poor citizens of developing countries rarely travel to other countries, they do have a need to accept remittances from relatives working in wealthier countries.
So the real need and money maker would be to capitalize on the huge micro banking system that has already been created in developing countries (via their tiny stores) into an international version of Western Union without all of the fees.

If I use obugookies for currency and have printed 1,000 of them and you use gulumakis for currency and have printed 10,000 of them, then 1 ubugookies will trade for 10 gulimakis in an efficient market.
It doesn't matter in the least how often either currency is transacted.  It only matters how much of it there is and that both are completely liquid in each market.
One could simply divide 60 trillion by 11 million to get the exchange rate between dollars and bitcoins if both were completely liquid (100% true adoption of bitcoin at the same level as the U.S. dollar worldwide).

I also didn't want to deal with trying to get 10,000 euros or $10,000 out of the country without using a wire transfer and I didn't want to deal with a wire transfer to a bank in this country.
I suggested bitcoin and the seller jumped on it.  Why wouldn't they?  It makes for a much easier transaction.  There were no government forms to fill out, no appointment to make at a bank, no extra attorney documents, no escrow.

There are actually two inherent possibilities for "voting" or coming to agreement embodied within the bitcoin protocol.
Only one is democracy (ie: mobocracy or control of the minority by the majority).  And it results in a perfectly nice outcome.  Where there is a 51% majority, a "fork" can occur where the minority which would otherwise be oppressed by the majority simply "fork" to their own chain.
The other is 100% consensus.  Nothing can happen within a fork without 100% of the users agreeing.
When you put those two concepts together, you create an extremely powerful form of societal decision making that makes every single political ideology happy (except those who believe it is moral to enslave other human beings... which who cares about making them happy... they are evil criminals).
Socialists of every imaginable variety can have their own fork.  Libertarians are never forced to do anything against their will since they are one of the 100% required to reach consensus within their own fork.  Limited government advocates have their own fork.  Anarchists their own.
The current tyranny called democracy (where 51% of the people can force the minority to bend to their will) no longer exists with forced consensus within a fork and a fork resulting whenever consensus can't be reached.

Fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP) construction is vastly superior to ferro-cement at sea.  The number of vessels constructed with with FRP exceeds ferro-cement by at least 100 to 1.

Of course it is.  A currency becomes a currency by being adopted as such.
In this case, the currency is purposefully limited in supply.
That means that the exchange rate with other peer currencies which have a known m2 or monetary supply can be calculated.
Of course adoption rate will directly be tied to exchange rates with other currencies until we hit a certain rate of adoption.  Then it is just a matter of relative supply of each currency.
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:46:45
I gave that basis in PayPal (and the Internet, and cell phones and in anything else that spreads virally in the way bitcoin is).
Adoption rates don't level off.  They increase.
For instance, January was a bit over 2% per day.  February was a bit over 3% per day.  March was a bit over 5% per day.
That is why everyone who is looking at bitcoin as an investment is all worried about a "bubble" and the charts going "parabolic."   When that happens with a stock or commodity, it is often the sign of an impending crash.
But it is extremely common with new paradigm adoption rates.  It is actually the norm.  Read Idea Virus or just look at how every new technology has been adopted to see the ever increasing rate of growth during the adoption phase.
Of course there could be set backs.  Maybe April would have been an 8%/day month.  Maybe Mt. Gox and other exchanges can't get their act together.  Maybe nobody else enters the market to the rescue this month.
Or maybe it could be an explosive month.  Flu season describes those months where they flu season virus explodes in numbers that dwarf the other months.
We'll see.
The basis is that the end game is at least $100K/bitcoin.   Technologies adopt faster and faster, not slower and slower.  PayPal adopted from start to grandfather adoption in eight years.   Internet adopted from commercial start in 1998 to 51% grandfather adoption in eight years.
Bitcoin had some setbacks.  Bitcoin's real commercial entry is only about 6 months ago just as the Internet had some setbacks and it took a couple decades to get to the 1998 commercial start line.
Let's talk again on June 2nd and see what you think; OK?

Some cruisers also actually avoid the standard cruiser hangouts once they know how to be self-sufficient.  We spent six weeks in one place and 3 months in another where there was no society in sight.
It's all up to you.  Raft up or dock and have a mini city in the marina for awhile... or anchor off an uninhabited island and enjoy free solar electricity and fresh fish every day.   Do what you want.  That's the point; right?

It is a gradual process.  The physical pieces of paper you call the USD are only a fraction of the USD denominated balances anyway.  The amount of pieces of paper is adjusted all the time based on demand.
That actually doesn't change the value of the dollar.  It is the creating out of thin air "new dollars" in the computers and loaning them into existence that devalues the dollar.
The use for paper currency will probably never be replaced or if it is, it won't be in my lifetime.
To replace paper currency with Bitcoin would require that everyone have a smart phone and that everyone trusts that smart phone's battery won't die and that it's Internet connection will always work.
Otherwise, most people will still continue to carry some backup paper currency.  I suppose the physical bitcoins could catch on more and eventually replace the U.S. dollar.
If so, that's not really all that remarkable.  The holders of german marks were forced to hand them in for euros not that long ago.  The U.S. actually already printed paper Ameros in preparation for a North American/South America version of the euro.
Switching from one physical currency to another does happen.  Whether it will happen with the U.S. dollar is entirely up to the politicians and bankers if we are talking about switching from one centralized currency to another.
Switching from physical paper U.S. dollars to physical paper or coined BTC would be up to the market to decide, but probably won't become a factor until BTC is adopted to the saturation rate of the current digital money (the 1's and 0's in the bank's computers).

The best place I can think of to easily film such a documentary would be Panama City.  Ask your taxi to take you to Las Brisas de Amador on the causeway.
One marina on the causeway is called La Playita.  The really interesting folks are on the Las Brisas side anchored for free and using a dinghy dock originally provided by the government, but falling apart so now spontaneous voluntary cooperation of the cruisers provides a pull across dinghy ferry for cruisers.
Pizza night is Thurs evening starting a 6pm at the pizza place next to La Playita.  Cruiser net is on channel 74 at 9am daily except Sunday (get a portable at radio shack to listen in and make contact at the appropriate time during the morning net.
There are usually about 100 cruisers there at any one time.  Some have been there for years.  Others have been there for less than a week and plan to either traverse the canal or just came through the canal and plan to head to the Galapagos, up the Pacific coast or out to the South Pacific (Marquesas islands 1st... or Galapagos and then Marquesas).
Donna on Nintai is the defacto mayor (or Alcalde).  She has been there for years living on Nintai.  Give her a call on Channel 74 if you don't want to wait for the net.  She'll give you cell phone numbers of folks to interview... and handle contacting others on the 'net if you don't want to try that.

I suppose that is a good example of how the protocol could help people understand what they have power over (without violence) and the actions they are taking (such as voting in an election) that are actually quite violent, but are masked to help those voting not realize the consequences of their violence.
What happens if group A decides that bitcoin should have 50,000,000 units of currency and group b decides that bitcoin should have 100,000,000 units of currency?
Exactly. Each individual suddenly realizes that they don't own bitcoin and they have no power to force such a change.  They can convince 100% of bitcoin users and developers to make the change.
Or they can convince whatever percentage they can to fork bitcoin to bitcoina and bitcoinb (leaving bitcoin to those remaining).

I posted what 5% per day looks like in a comment and it does end up at &gt;$2,000 on June 2nd (which happens to be 60 days).  The 5% is a very conservative example of what can happen.  It is based on being less than the actual performance for the prior 30 days at the time.  It certainly isn't my claim though.
My claim is $1,000 in 60 days (actually less than 60 days now).
It certainly wouldn't surprise me if we hit $2,000 or more by then.  But my claim is a rather conservative $1,000 by June 2nd as you can see by the title of this post.

BTW, I have no idea if the seller was dishonest or not.  How do I know that they didn't do their part and actually release the coins?   They did do something with their phone.  They may be 100% honest and completed the transaction exactly as they said they would.
My problem is with LocalBitcoins.com because they made two false claims:
1) That they offer escrow.  They don't.  The escrowed coins were unilaterally confiscated.  LocalBitcoins claims they were returned to the seller.  If their claim is true, then they helped the seller steal from me.  If their claim is not true, then LocalBitcoins actually stole the coins.  I can't say which thing happened.  But I can say (and it is even admitted by LocalBitcoins) that they claim to have an escrow system, but they actually don't.
2) That they offer a feedback system for buyers and sellers on their site.  They publish multiple positive feedback for most buyers and sellers to make people feel more secure in doing business there.   It isn't what it appears to be.  Negative feedback about theft isn't included because LocalBitcoins prohibits it.
Both items are very serious.  They do represent lies by LocalBitcoins.  They do represent a policy of covering up theft.
Either item should warn people away from LocalBitcoins toward something safer.

Bitcoin Foundation represents Bitcoin Foundation, not bitcoin.  Bitcoin is represented by algorithms and ruled only by 100% consensus.
Anyone who downloads a client is represented by the bitcoin algorithms, not the Bitcoin Foundation.
The Bitcoin Foundation neither created bitcoin nor represents it in any way.  The word "bitcoin" was purposefully not trademarked so that it could be used by everyone.  A by-product of that decision is that evil people can form organizations that have the intent of tricking others into believing they are the governing body of bitcoin.
They are not.  Their attempt constitutes fraud.  People believing that they somehow represent bitcoin constitutes ignorance.

You didn't advertise a "dispute resolution system."  If you had, I wouldn't have been ripped off by you for $200.  I would never have engaged in business with a company offering a "dispute resolution system."   PayPal has a "dispute resolution system" and so many people have been ripped off by it that PayPal is avoided.
No, you claimed you had an escrow system which is VERY different.  Dispute resolution systems rely on a fallible human being making a judgement call.  An escrow system guarantees that it is impossible for a scammer to get away with their scam because it takes the explicit approval of the victim to do so (which a scammer would never get).
You claimed to have an escrow system.  You LIED (not the first time either... you also LIED about your feedback system).   When something is in escrow, it can only be released by the agreement of the other party.  THAT IS WHAT ESCROW MEANS!   But you released the 6+ bitcoins (price was $27.5 at the time) to the scammer who put them there WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.   That is NOT escrow.  That is a scam and you were explicitly in conspiracy with the scammer for it to happen.
You don't have lots of work to do.  You just have to STOP LYING and covering for scammers.  If you claim to have escrow then ACTUALLY HAVE ESCROW.  If you claim to have a feedback system to protect both parties, then ACTUALLY HAVE A FEEDBACK SYSTEM and don't prohibit negative feedback when you HELP a scammer scam someone.
I have already wasted three hours of my life with support arguing with liars and thieves.  I warned you that if you didn't allow negative feedback on your site about scammers (which you claimed you did before I was scammed), then the only recourse was to give negative feedback on other sites warning others that YOU are a SCAM.
That's just reality.  Don't pretend that you are willing to personally disburse losses from your scams here.  Nobody will believe you here because:
1) Many others here have been the victim of your scams.
2) There is a tipbot here where everyone could see in public that you were willing to reimburse me for your scam.   But you don't like public things, do you?  Thieves and liars like to hide in the shadows and claim they would stop lying and stealing if you only contacted them by private email.
Nobody knows how much money you make with your scams.  Nobody cares.  It is besides the point entirely.  If you are an incompetent scammer, then fine... you are still a scammer and others need to be warned not to use your "service."

Magazines such as Latitude 38 (for the SF Bay Area which is well represented on or Blue Water Cruising are where most people start.
The reality is that you can't become a real part of the community until you become a real part of the community.  The community communicates via email, sometimes blogs (sailblogs.com I think is a common place) and VHF (short range for the local community) and SSB radio (world wide communications).  They call their radio meetups "nets" and you can get the frequencies from the magazines or your local cruisers.
Meet local cruisers by going to a marina and ask for the harbor master.  Ask him if he has any cruisers visiting and if they have a pizza night meetup.  Cruisers are extremely friendly (and often poor) so offer to buy one a beer and he/she/they will be happy to tell you more.
Or better yet, ask the harbor master if there are any distressed boats behind on their slip fees.  Buy yourself a $3,000 boat and flip through the channels on the VHF every morning until you find the local net (usually at 9am or so on a channel like 74 or 77 or 68... it varies with the locality).
When someone asks for help on the 'net, offer to help them fix whatever they are doing.  Ask them for tips on fixing the boat you just bought and getting it ready to leave the country (whatever country you are in... this applies to any country with a coastline).
You'll learn enough within about a year to leave and be self-sufficient at sea (although everyone in the cruising community will always tell you that you need more time).  Leave and go to the next place.  You are now officially a "cruiser" and the community at your new port will welcome you as such (especially if it is in a new country).   The community is extremely tight knit.

One even better comparison with adoption rates would be with the Internet itself.  It was never a company with stock.  It was an infrastructure... just an idea and a protocol... just like Bitcoin.
It required companies to bring the Internet from the mildly interesting creature it was under government and university control to the society changing creature it has become.
That is true of Bitcoin too.  MtGox, Coinbase, BitPay and all of the others are required to cause the paradigm shift.  Some may fail (like Instawallet) and that is just fine.  Many early Internet infrastructure providers failed (I did in the end... after making millions while my companies provided value).
In the end, it was a viral level of adoption and it changed the world.  Bitcoin is exactly the same.  The infrastructure is just trying to keep up and so our price as expressed in USD is being bottlenecked.
It is actually closer to $1,000 in value right now and will double every 45 days or so as it becomes an epidemic (using the viral terminology).  At epidemic levels (full adoption), it will be worth $100K-$1,000,000 per bitcoin.
The parabolic effect right now is just the market trying to equalize at the $1,000 it should be right now... but it can't because the infrastructure (exchanges, etc) are preventing a speedy correction.

Paying help "under the table" has always been illegal.  The "average individual" really doesn't care about most of the government's laws.
In fact, it is impossible for the "average individual" to even read all of the government's laws in an entire life-time.   I have only known two people in my entire life of meeting thousands of people who have even tried to read some of the government's laws.  Neither did so to try to comply with them.
People follow the laws they follow almost coincidentally.  They hear about laws by rumor.  They also hear about what is being enforced by rumor.  They follow laws only if:
1) They believe from the rumors that something actually is against the law.
2) They hear that it is actually being enforced and they fear the consequences.
3) If the law just happens to coincide with their own sense of morality.
Nobody will stop using Bitcoin for reason   Using Bitcoin isn't immoral.  It isn't even debatable like perhaps the gun control, drugs or abortion issues are debatable (simply meaning those issues have two sides).  There won't be anyone on the other side of the Bitcoin issue.  It simply isn't the kind of issue where  would ever come into play.
A government may create a big campaign to claim that Bitcoin is illegal.  People may find that amusing, but that isn't enough to cause compliance whatsoever.  They also have to believe there is a method of compliance.
There simply isn't with Bitcoin directly.  There can be raids on surrounding infrastructure.  Exchanges can be closed.  Businesses can be forced to remove their "Bitcoin accepted here" signs under threat of force.  A war can be waged just like there is a silly war against drugs currently.
But compliance can't be enforced with Bitcoin any more than piracy laws can be enforced.  Both are wars against ones and zeros.
You can have advocates who obey the drug laws for reason   You can even have some who obey because of  and 
But you can't convince anyone that ones and zeros are evil and should be avoided for reason   Nor can you convince anyone that the gun toting government enforcers have any ability to enforce laws and force penalties to satisfy 
There is no "other side" to support a war against ones and zeros.  It would be completely pointless and have no effect whatsoever.  In fact, the war against ones and zeros is already being waged under the banner of "piracy prevention."   It is haven't almost no effect.

The global warming crowd decided that they wanted something more than a 50% chance of being right.  So they changed their name to the "climate change" crowd.  That was a safe bet.
I am with the "exchange rate change" crowd.  I solidly believe that the price will go up at some time in the future and that it will go down at other times in the future.  It will change.  I'm sticking with that.  Change is certain.
If Bitcoin succeeds in it's endeavors though, it has to be exchanged at a rate of $100K to $1M or more (depending on how much more the dollar devalues by that time).   It appears to be on the path to becoming what it is intended to become in the next few years.
So I think it's a safe bet that it will generally head up against the dollar until we are in the $100K per bitcoin range when there could be a major correction.
Until then any step backs will probably be minor unless there is an extinction level event for Bitcoin (a fatal bug, massive attack by the powers that be, major societal collapse leading to minimal use or ability to use the Internet, etc).

A linked list and indexing items of that linked list by hashes of the contents is very, very old computer science.
I think his conception of actually having the entire ledger available to everyone via p2p was fairly revolutionary.
I can imagine thousands of computer scientists before him starting to ponder an entire ledger being shared and immediately dismiss it as not being able to scale.
He took that dismissed idea and thought it through.  He ran the numbers and realized that disk space was increasing over time... and that p2p technology already existed for piecemeal transfer of huge files to vast numbers of peers.

Currency other than bitcoin could become worthless or nearly worthless.  Although that isn't really likely for a very long time.  Bitcoin doesn't solve EVERY currency problem.

But assuming that bitcoin is 100% adopted worldwide and is the defacto currency of the world (like the "credit" in sci fi movies).  In that scenario, current currency is worthless, but currency does not equal money.
Bitcoin still exists as a currency.  And money exists even if no currency exists.  People bartered (which is money) long before currency existed.

If a virus takes away from something else, there will be attempts to fight that virus by that something else.
Bitcoin is pretty similar to P2P file sharing in that regard which has some pretty big money players fighting it... unsuccessfully.
Albeit, the enemies of Bitcoin are even more powerful.  But the benefits of Bitcoin are even more required to society.
By bet is that the attacks will be fruitless.  Even if the enemy succeeds in this first battle (as they did with Napster in the file sharing war), they can't win the war.

The time to adopt was much longer with older technologies sometimes taking 20-30 years.   Cell phone and later is more like 6-8 years.  Smart phones are more like 2-3 years.

I'm not affiliated with any party.  In fact, I personally find it morally reprehensible to vote.  Voting is a way to attempt to legitimize the control of minorities by the majority.
Bitcoin as designed is non-centralized.  It respects each individual as his/her own decider.  In other words, it is libertarian.  You could also say it is classical liberalism or voluntarism or consensus rule.  That's semantics.
Bitcoin Foundation is centrist.  It is an attempt of the few to rule the many.  It is a fraud attempting to claim ownership and the right to represent bitcoin.
It isn't a matter of who supports bitcoin or Bitcoin Foundation.  I'm sure Bitcoin Foundation is perfectly happy to accept members from any political affiliation or people with any particular ideology.   I know for a fact, that the bitcoin algorithms have absolutely no preference for the political affiliation of it's users nor their ideology.
Everyone does feel comfortable enough to embrace bitcoin regardless of party affiliation.  It just isn't an issue.
In the above post, I wasn't addressing party affiliation at all except to use an example that the Libertarian Party doesn't actually represent libertarians.  Any number of other examples could have been used to illustrate the same point.
The point is that Bitcoin Foundation does not represent bitcoin in any way whatsoever.  They simply use the word "bitcoin" in the name of their organization.  So do many, many other organizations.  The word "bitcoin" was purposefully left untrademarked so that anyone could use it in free association.  The use of the word in the name of your organization does not grant any particular rights to represent bitcoin users.

I see you have never visited Ghana.
Government intervention isn't much of a reason (if you are talking about laws and such nonsense... if you are talking about government officials randomly killing people, I suppose government might be part of the impediment).
The standard way of selling gasoline or diesel in Ghana is in a used water bottle from a street stall.
People kill people because SQUIRREL.   Dead bodies decompose in the street while people ignore them.   Roads have flat people on them like you might find a flat cat on the pavement in a western country.
People believe in witchcraft.  People are burned alive by neighbors for cursing them with witchcraft.

All things growing at a particular viral rate will experience the exact same growth pattern.  It is just mathematics.
That is how the CDC can detect an epidemic when only 500 people are currently affected.  If 5 people were infected 2 weeks ago and 50 people were infected last week, then a viral effect of 10X per week is established.
Things can affect that viral rate.  One can reduce it with an emergency vaccine, a quarantine or education about behaviors that cause transmission.  One can also increase it by having a mass crowd event in the area of current infection.
But a viral idea spreads just like a virus.  It doesn't matter if it is PayPal, the Internet, Bitcoin, small pox or the plague.

LocalBitcoins is a scam.  That is the 1st place I tried.  I was ripped off for $200.
Don't send newbies there.  It is well known that their escrow system is NOT an escrow system.  It is a tool to make buyers feel more comfortable giving up their cash.  LocalBitcoins gives your bitcoins back to the seller upon request even after you have paid your cash.
They also claim to have a feedback system.  They don't.  They refuse to allow you to leave negative feedback when scammed.  They claim that you can only leave feedback for "complete transactions."
Don't steer newbies toward known scams.  It's hard enough getting your 1st bitcoins.  Be a good citizen and help!

No.  The exchange rate of a currency in relation to another currency means nothing at all.  It's just an arbitrary number.
I've lived in several different countries with currency denominated radically different than the dollar.  In one country, 500,000 of that currency equal $1.  In another 20 of that currency equals $1.   Once you think in the currency rather than converting it to the dollar, it becomes natural to pay 20 units for a soda out of a machine (or 500,000 units for the other currency).

Gavin is the source.  He said his last communication with Satoshi was to tell him he planned to speak at the CIA about bit coin.
Satoshi never replied and hasn't been heard from since.
Gavin himself reported that numerous times.  He has also said that he suspects that is the reason for Satoshi withdrawing from the project and disappearing.
I'm sure you have access to Google.  Here is just one out of hundreds of places where Gavin tells about his last communication with Satoshi:

You are apparently stuck in the pre-Internet world of adoption rates.
Nothing takes decades to adopt anymore.  Some things take 4-7 years.
Bitcoin is over four years old now and it looks like it is headed for full adoption around the end of 2013 or perhaps 1st quarter of 2014.
How could you imagine it taking years from now, much less decades?

BTW, we've been doing it for a long time.  It is not only possible.  It is how it is currently done.
And you "voters" aren't even in the main blockchain in case you haven't noticed.  Take a look at the rate of participation in the last 100 elections where you "voted" on something.
Did you not notice that you don't even have 51% participation with your "voting is the way to decide" fork?   That means you aren't even the longest blockchain.  You aren't even the main fork.  We are.
And we will always be the longest blockchain because voting is an evil way for the majority to attempt to coerce the minority.  It turns out that a true majority of the population aren't evil and refuse to participate in your illusion of what constitutes the "real world."
Imagine that.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:37:38
That already exists.
I was just observing that an adaptation of the Bitcoin protocol could aid in determining if there is consensus or aiding decisions on which societal forks in one desires participation.
Actually it was the OP's observation.  I was just agreeing.

A lot of people do it.  It's usually Starbucks, but I've seen people selling laptops, phones and bikes by meeting at Starbucks.
It does seem strange to me, but I would probably do it for an item of less than $200 or so.  But I'm in a position where walking away from a $200 issue isn't that big of a deal.  Back when I worked fast food for a living for $3.15/hour, I sure wouldn't have done something like that.
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:35:02
Not much.  As I said, I rarely even talk to members of your society.  I certainly don't involve myself in trying to solve the problems you create with violence and voting in your society.
It is your problem, not mine.

I actually did invest in the Internet in 1995 (became the first ISP in my city of about a million people at the time).  I also sold an internet access kit on seven floppies in Tower Books.
It was a blast and I made a lot of money.
I'm ready for another ride.  Bitcoin is that ride.  It will benefit society even more than the Internet has already changed the very fabric of society.  I'm here and I'm in 150% on this world changing ride.

I just implemented most of a Bitcoin client from scratch.  I never once used sha512.   I never once saw it mentioned in any specs.
I can't imagine why a vulnerability in sha512 would affect Bitcoin in any way.
A vulnerability in ECDSA could be catastrophic.
A vulnerability in sha256 might be a problem.  I can't actually see how though.

The same way I anyone can easily establish that Julian702 is only one person.
You write.  Everyone's writing is like a fingerprint.
A group can use a single spokesman, but in Satoshi's case... there were many cases where he spontaneously responded to developers or fellow crypto-anarchists without the delay that would be required if a spokesperson was consulting the group they represented.

You are welcome to get ripped off by LocalBitcoins.com yourself if you wish.
I'm just warning others that they lie about having an escrow system, they lie about having a feedback system (they don't allow negative feedback after a scam) and they actively assist scammers and probably even profit from stealing from others.
They stole $200 from me.   Many others have posted even larger thefts by LocalBitcoins.com.
Bitcoin will never work if scammers aren't exposed and people aren't warned to avoid them.

If you were so smart, you could do the rest of the math.
Take an adoption curve and see where we are on it.  Extrapolate it out to full adoption rate.  Where do you end up?
Adoption rates of new technology are getting faster and faster, not slower and slower.  We are in year 5 of Bitcoin adoption.  I haven't heard of a major adoption that has taken more than 6-8 years since the year 2,000.
I think everyone understands that Bitcoin could possibly fail.  That leads to a $0 exchange rate.   Partial adoption for a "currency" isn't really possible.  So the only other option other than failure is full adoption.  There is no way to hide it from a part of the world.  There is no significant place in the world that simply has no need for currency.  Full adoption is the only option for Bitcoin other than complete failure.

Only barbarians fight for the same real resources.
Those of us in the society I participate within don't use violence to take resources that belong to another.  We trade our time or our own resources for those who want what we have more than what we want from them.
That is the real world.  We consider your "society" where people use violence or voting to steal resources from others to be avoided as much as possible.
There already are forks in the real world.  There are more than you can imagine.  Most of us are users of several different societal forks already.
I don't have to propose a solution for something that already exists.
There is an inexactness of information that could be solved with a bitcoin like protocol though.  Sometimes people are involved in societal groups because of misinformation about the true nature of those groups.  The bitcoin protocol could be adapted to help in those cases.
It also would help for the "voters" who sometimes really can't decide things based on "voting."  Forking can resolve those issues with better information.  I still wouldn't be involved with any of those forks that practice "voting" or any other form of violence against others.  But it could be helpful for those who are in those societal forks.
Different societal forks already exist in the real world.  You can't do anything about it, just as you can't do anything about litecoin existing regardless of how you feel about it nor how much you vote about it.

In what state?  In California (where I served) a robbery requires:
In order to convict you of robbery, the prosecutor must prove the following facts (otherwise known as elements of the crime):
1. you took property that didn't belong to you,
2. from another person's possession or immediate presence,
3. against that person's will
4. using force or threats, and
5. when you took the property, you intended to deprive the owner of it permanently or for such an extended period of time that the owner would be deprived of a major portion of the value or enjoyment of the property.
Where is the force or threats?  He didn't force or threaten the "victim" to send the bitcoin.  He didn't forcefully take possession of the headphones (they were already in his possession).  He never threatened the victim nor used force.
It's not a robbery under California law.  I can't think of a state where this would be robbery.  It is a civil issue according to POST training and every state that uses POST certified officers (which I think is every state in the U.S.)
If you are a former LEO, what statute would you arrest him on?  Certainly not 211PC in California.  It doesn't fit.

No.  It says "Here is the actual expected schedule".  It never says it is what I expect.  I certainly would not expect an exact 5% growth per day.  That is ludicrous.  
If I did expect that, then I would have said so.  I didn't.  "The" does not equal "my."  The word "the" implies factual or historical (in this case), not personal.  The word "my" is used for personal expectations.
My claim is in the title of the post.  The table is what would be expected if a 5% per day increase continued.  5% was the rate of increase for March.
You will notice that the expected table is actually MORE optimistic than my claim.
My claim is the title of the post though.  $1,000 in 60 days.
