This is a bit disingenuous in any case. Most sensible people realize that even if you have 99.999% confidence in something, you might be wrong so putting all of your money there is not a good choice. This becomes clear when you turn the question around on yourself.
Your insinuating that if people "really" believed, they'd put their money where their mouth is and would be fully vested. This isn't how the world works though, not for anyone, not for anyone in the crypto community, and not for anyone outside it, and not for you.
Is there any company or asset you believe in? Take Gold for instance, are you 100% sure Gold will be more valuable in 1yr than it is today? how about 50% sure? How about 5% sure?
Maybe you think gold will lose value in 1yr, are you 100% sure? how about 50% sure? or 5%?
Finally, perhaps you are 100% confident that gold will maintain value consistent with USD in 1 year.
In any case, by your argument I could demand of you that your portfolio reflect your opinion on gold. 100% sure it'll be lower, you damn well better have a short in for 100% of your net worth. 5% sure it'll be higher? Better be allocating 5% of your net worth to gold, etc. for any tradable asset, currency, etc.
This just isn't the way the world works.
I do wholeheartedly believe that putting money into Bitcoin is a sure bet today. And yes, I am invested. But no, I still have cash in my wallet and I still own a bicycle, etc. I haven't liquidated all of my assets to put in crypto.

Perhaps when you restored your wallet.dat, core is still syncing so the unconfirmed transaction hasn't reflected in your core UI yet. Make sure you wait until your node is 100% up to date.

99% may be a high estimate.


It definitely exists. Things don't need to be held in your hand to have value. Gold is shiny and scarce and has physical properties, these factors contribute to its value. Electricity you can't hold in your hand, but it has properties that make it valuable, for instance you can mine Bitcoin with it. Intellectual Property you often can't hold in your hand, but it's valuable. Bitcoin is valuable because it's decentralized, no one controls your access to it, and no one can prevent you from sending your coins to someone else (among other reasons).


This is true, but it's not really scary. Bitcoin is still in a value discovery phase, as are the other cryptocurrencies in existence. Cryptocurrency in general is severely undervalued. Rapid growth does not equal bubble.
Bitcoin's market acceptance as a payment system or settlement layer or store of value has not been determined yet, there are still many many companies and individuals who are on the fence, waiting to see, waiting to adopt, in the process of adopting, etc.
As some adopt and others choose other currencies and others commit to the way things are now, all of these changes will be reflected in price. But it is so early in this lifecycle that no one really knows where Bitcoin will settle.
**It may be a bubble** in reality. It is possible that in 5 years the applications for bitcoin and market acceptance of other coins will drive the price down to ~$100 per coin or less. At that time it would be fair to say the current price *was* indeed a bubble. But it's only speculation to say that now, and it's a very naive speculation.
**It may not be a bubble** in reality. It is possible that in 5 years people are doing their day-to-day grocery shopping, debt settlement, and long term store of wealth using Bitcoin. There are a lot of advantages to businesses, governments, and individuals to doing this. If this happens, we're looking at Bitcoin value soaring, $100k, definitely, $500k, why not?, $5M, eventually this is not unreasonable at all. BTC may not have its highest value as a traditional "currency" being used for groceries. Maybe it does become the new gold standard and is used worldwide as a reserve currency, every nation holds it, most people hold some amount of savings in it but transact using other cryptos, who knows but this use might put the value even higher. WE JUST DON'T KNOW.
Despite not knowing, there is sufficient reason to believe that Bitcoin and many other cryptos are extremely undervalued in the long term. The way I look at it, I think the value of bitcoin 5 years from now has maybe a 0.01% chance of being less valuable than it is today, maybe a 90% chance of being at least 100% more valuable, maybe a 30% chance of being 1000% more valuable, maybe a 5% chance of being 10000% more valuable. A lot of people's hopes are not as high or ambitious as mine, but a lot of people who are relatively educated on what Bitcoin is and how it works believe in similar probabilities.
