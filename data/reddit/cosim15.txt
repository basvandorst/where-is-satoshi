Clearly you have no knowledge in criminal law procedures...
In your view, the bitconnect scam was also legit, because nobody forced anyone to buy a later-proved useless token :)
Read some books or stay naive... either way, I dont care

Its a total scam!  
Puzzle maker sold 300 USD paintings to people, made a profit ant withdrew the prize money.... Soo legit 
Link to sold out paintings for 299 USD  
[  
Link to quantity of paintings sold (50)  
[  
Math: 299x50 = 14950 USD (since its sold out; not even counting the 799 ones)

Interesting note. 
To infinity and beyond \-\&gt; "2  ∞  &amp; \&lt;"
**If you go from No. 2 up to infinity and then straight to the right, you find beyond \( \&lt; \).**

There is an infinty symbol above zero in the pic.
Most important note is this: Where would you be without the clues? If you were in the position of cryptogreetings, it would one of two: Either you planned ahead that you would give out the clues, crucial to solving this puzzle, or that they were just a good idea \(this one is the correct answer\).
My point: Forget the clues for a minute and focus just on the pic and the initial message with it. Y**ou are supposed to solve the puzzle with just that, nothing more.**
I personally don't see any indication in the pic, o the initial message suggesting 12 pairs of words \+1 then eliminating the 25th word \-1. Point is: if you come up with the idea of eliminating the 25th word, hence \-1, it should logically come from just form the pic and the initial message. If it doesn't, it just might not be the right answer.
I dont see how Elliptic curve theory is so impossible, since some redditors have noticed:










































I dont buy the fact, that this is simple just because the OP sells gift cards. It should have been solved by now

Consider if the puzzle if fake and was INTENTED to lure people in to buy paintings at inflated prices - that would be the definition of a scam.
Even though the act itself cannot be criminalized on this basis, because, as you said, nobody forced people to buy those paintings, but in a broader sense, selling an object with a promise of a non-existing puzzle with a prize is fraud. This act could be criminalized if an only the majority of painting owners file a suit AND the puzzle is proven to be a fake.
Interesting point: even though the puzzle ended, the puzzle-maker till this day did not provide a solution, further casting doubt on the puzzle's authenticity.
EDIT: I would not have called this a scam if the puzzle-maker provided a solution to the puzzle, if one is provided, I would no longer think this was a scam
EDIT2: For a guy who made more than 20k USD in the paintings, withdrawing the prize money of 6k USD is quite shaddy...,

I honestly got the idea from here
Edit: you know... what is more than ifinity? ∞ &lt; ?.... beyond I guess

Ok, here are my thoughts about this \(because I am giving up, because I think this is way over my level if I am even remotely right\). Lets get through all the clues first
1. You can throw out at least half of the words in the picture
2. Think in pairs
3. Code easily, attack early
4. Lost transaction costs almost users
5. 00212121
6. Try \+1
7. Almost open
8. Bonus clue: To triumph, one must look within. To infinity, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot. \(from here\)
9. \-1
**WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN???????**
**MY ANSWER:**
**First off**, I think, that the picture does not have the seed words to the bitcoin address. Even if it does, it might not be systemically linked together, rather than scattered across.
**Second**, I think that the whole picture is just a bacground for decoding the private key through **Elliptic Curve Cryptography and the finite \(prime\) field.** [LINK](
I base my opinion because:
**Second** **clue**: Think in pairs.


I think the first clue is given as gentle nudge into this direction.
**Third** **clue:** code easily, attack early.
Even though all of these words can my acceptable BIP39 words, there is one problem: Attack early is next to each other, and that is ok, but code and easily are seperated quite significantly. How does this help? I think it falls right into the ECDSA theory quite well. These are probably the points on the Elliptic curves, on the  finite \(prime field\). **Same thing goes for the fourth, seventh and sixth clue.**
**Fifth clue**: 00212121
Honestly, I cant remember, but I saw, that an 8 digit number of somesort is also significant to this ECDSA thing, but I honestly cannot find the page I found this.
**Sixth and ninth clue**: Try \+1, \-1. 
Since \-1 is nowhere to be found on the picture, it reminded me that, that there exists a group law on the set of all points on a given elliptic curve \(**where \-1 IS significant**\). See [LINK1]( [LINK2](
**Eitht** **bonus clue**: To triumph, one must look within. To **infinity**, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot.
It so happens, that **there is also a point of infinity on the ECDSA curve AND on the picture**. [LINK1]( [LINK2]( [LINK3](
**These coincidences leave me to believe, that the picture is a an encrypted map of the private key. If so, I believe, that if the picture would be decrypted with the ECDSA curve** ***OR SOMETHING IN THAT NATURE*** PERHAPS, you could find the private key, or at least come closer to it.

Good luck!
