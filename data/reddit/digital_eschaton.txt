Holy bitcointip Batman!  Please give me ฿ 1 bitcoin!

Right.  So, even in the extremely improbable situation, mesh networking could provide possible means for  ฿ transactions.

Please correct this if wrong; Fee amount predicts the transaction priority.  Senders who volunteer no or low fee along with a transaction will have a low processing priority.

What about transaction fee, and if it is awarded to the miner?  Could that be classified as a *cut*?     
Still trying to wrap my head round the *fee* mechanism. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:38:28
easier to mine than gold too.

Assume that Governments (**Banks**) will try, but will fail.  
Seems likely that Alt-Coins are a necessity for the whole of Cryptocurrency survival.

Any thing with vectors of control, including bitcoin, can and will be controlled by governments.  It is called 'regulation'.

Thanks for the clarification. This has been some what of a gray area of the mechanism.  Noticing 100K+ transactions for .50 fee, is amazing!  even at 50.00 the fee would be so nominal.  I think miners should be entitled to a reasonable fee.   
Often I've contemplated the faucet phenomenon.  Currently faucets are the only source of BTC that I have access to. Many of the faucets dry up quickly.  Some are never replenished.   The idea that I had was a way to make BTC Faucets more ubiquitous.  Say for example, all transactions were subject to payout a very small fee or portion there of, to go towards the public faucet reservoir.  Accounted in public ledger, and is accessible to anyone whom wishes to tap a faucet.  This would allow a fair way for low or zero income individuals to acquire BTC.  BTC collected from public faucets would in turn have an automatically ascribed portion of the transaction fee.  This ensures that the BTC collected from faucets, when spent, keep those same faucets and others running.

We have put up a [bandcamp experimental Bitcoin]( page as a means to make special offers to our patrons who dig the music, want to own copies, and want to pay in bitcoin!   We hope people will check it out. Would be stoked to hear some feedback too.

Using a static live Linux OS from a bootable flash drive would be getting at the same level as a newly installed OS.

Oh, that is just opinion right?  Because it depends on what is considered easier.  BTC still seems easier to me, what with the lack of digging and what else, physically mining rocks.
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:39:03
200k in bitcoint weights a hell of a lot less than 200k in gold.
