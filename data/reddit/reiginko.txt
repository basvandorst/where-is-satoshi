I'd say set up a bi-weekly buy right now. The price will fluctuate, but in the long term it will rise.

yeah because he's paying them for the fucking job they're doing. If HBO distributes your DVDs, you'd expect to not pay them?

Yes. A huge meteor hits the earth and we're worried about the price of gold falling.

What makes you think the price will crash? I ask because I'm totally new to BTC, trying to learn a bit more about it.

Is there any way to keep a digital wallet and not have it connected to the internet all the time? For example, would it be possible to store a wallet on a USB drive, and only use the USB drive when you intend to add to or spend from the wallet? Would this be any more secure than keeping a digital wallet on a computer? For that matter, are there any inherent security issues with keeping a digital wallet on a computer connected to the internet?

Doesn't look like a panic. It dropped down to ~$800 on Coinbase, now it's back up around $950. Seems right on the mark to me. It'll have highs and lows here and there, but it still seems to be trending upwards.

So... seems like a pretty good reason then! xD

Can someone explain, step by step, the method by which BTC from an exchange site like Coinbase would be transferred to an offline wallet?
