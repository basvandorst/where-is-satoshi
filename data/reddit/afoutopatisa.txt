Bits is a bit (pun intended) too small, I think. You can buy a bit for about 2 cents, it suddenly feels too cheap. And it's like it implies that bitcoin is meant for microtransactions (it **will be** in the future but it's not near any good right now).

I'm aware that mods work hard but I suggest  they worked smart too. Manual work can only get you so far. That's why I think it's easier to use *some* sort of automation.

All I can do is submit my feedback to you guys so that you are aware that it starts feeling like groundhog day in here.

It's not exactly the same as linux refers to the kernel and all distributions share the exact same kernel, it's only the applications and tools that change. There is no such thing as different applications for bitcoin, the coins are all different even though all cryptocurrencies use an implementation of blockchain. In that sense, yes, you could have e.g. and see all cryptocurrencies represented there. That's a more appropriate equivalent ;)
Bitcoin does not claim to be the "one true cryptocurrency" but it IS bitcoin by definiton. There are others who are trying to use the same (or similar) name to ride the wave and get new users onboard who don't know the differences. Reason? -&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

I'm a dev too, but we leave testing to the QA people mostly; and of course they write lots of them (I don't even know the amount) but it's a full-time job that basically never ends. That said, these specific tests on LN have a very specific purpose and it's to ensure that these 3 networks can collaborate. 
I am fairly certain that there are seperate sets of tests for other purposes, security being the highest prio.

Left USA or Left European?  America's version of the left is very different from what we know here in EU - also Americans are extremely polarized and have a very toxic political ground (almost entirely due to the political system). Here we are bridging the gap with many parties and you could be Leftist and be 5 completely different things.. It's all relative.. 
That said no I have not associated CCs with politics and don't really find the reason either. It's a technology and like everything else (e.g. cars) it's not limited to left or right. All people drive cars.

Are you seriously asking or concern trolling? I just made a 6p tx in under an hour w/ 6 confirmations. That said, we are all early adopters of this technology. Merchants can use anything they want but IMO there is no rush to adopt RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW. I would rather everyone waited for some additional layers to handle the high traffic that will be generated from mass tx's. That's just my own perception :)

Whichever you think is best but this sub is about the original Bitcoin (aka Bitcoin Core) not its forks. It's like going to the DotA forums and asking if you should play DotA or LoL ;)

It belongs to the broader Arduino family yes :) It's a low-cost wifi chip.

If mods apply labels we will be able to filter...........
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:01:48
has 900k and the quality is INSANELY better. It's not the number, it's unfortunately the mods who allow that kind of bullshit (or don't tag them so normal users can filter them).

Why hodl that old RPi? Just buy an [I2C LCD for less than $2]( and turn it into a live ticker! 
Prices are from Coinbase.

I need to run. No time. Computer Off. Wipe All Data.

To all the concern trolls here know 1 thing: I don't care if this take 1 month 1 year or 100 years as long as it's a solutions that WORKS. Go troll elsewhere, I'm not in a hurry to pay any kind of coffee with bitcoins. This technology is shaping the future of mankind's economy and it's doing it with devoted developers that work hard for us. No-one wants your stupid ungrateful bitching.

I asked the mods multiple times to consolidate price posts in a price thread but nada.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:25:34
I know but my rpi does other stuff too (webserver/samba/pihole/pivpn) :D

Deebly goncerned, my friend?

This post from this 1 week account that pushes people to brigading should be treated with extra caution. Regardless of whether you think he's right.

What if someone bought bots to polarise both subs? The truth isn't binary, you know.
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:30:19
Pretty much.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:39:24
Leaver report

If you see one, just reply with a "deebly goncerned" image. Keeps em exposed.

This is pretty much all of reddit...

As long as everyone still has the option to run a full node, then no.

Which ports do I need to forward on my router to make this work?

This is exactly how I felt in 2014 when memes and twitch chat(which used to be frowned upon) took over the dota2 sub. I just accepted it and moved on.
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:59:22
Sorry, this went over my head. Care to explain? Isn't there only one bitcoin or are you implying otherwise? 
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:14:34
Thats equal to a Villa where I live. With a swimming pool and a garage. Why would I buy a car instead? ��

Can you help me read this site?? How did you get 61?

Localbitcoins provides and API but you need to find a seller that doesn't ask for ID 
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:18:42
Can confirm, a colleague told me about localbitcoins in UK, and turned out to be good (bank tranfer on someone with 1000+).
@_date: 2017-10-15 11:51:47
Awesome I really hope this picks up. Unfortunately I am not running an online shop, or else I would set this up. Good stuff.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:17:36
Not bad! Would appreciate a demo tx to be honest. Also I would like to use the container on my RPi
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:25:58
Who's "everyone"? I hear the opposite in this sub. What's the point of even saying something like that? What's not looking great?

Best guide out there, will never not upvote.
