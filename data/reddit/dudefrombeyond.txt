Well sure, they "believe" the payment system works better, so they agree to use bitcoin and that gives it value. They "agree" that bitcoin is a valuable resource worth holding and trading. The key here is to get more people to "agree" and see that. That's the point I was trying to make here:

Exactly. I always think it's .org for some reason.

What I always did was make a new blockchain.info wallet and put what I needed in there for that one transaction (you don't want to get mugged). Then I'd meet them and they'd give me cash, then I'd let them watch me transfer it to them. Meet in a public place where you'll have an internet connection. If you aren't meeting them offline, then just use localbitcoins system.

But if the rest of the world didn't agree with the US dollar being valuable, then all the weapons would mean nothing. If other countries, and even it's citizens, didn't agree that the dollar had value, then it would crash. If the coffee shop doesn't believe in my dollar, I can't buy anything there with my dollar. So if enough people/companies agree with that coffee shop and accept something else, then my dollar is nothing but paper. But if they all agree that it has value, like they do now, then my paper has more value. 
Just because the US has weapons doesn't mean anything. If the government decided to back another currency, and they got agreement with its citizens, then the dollar would mean nothing. It all comes back to who can get agreement and what we agree has value.

We've talked about it here:

This would be another one of mine.

Well yes of course, they use weapons as a means to get agreement, but how effective that is can be debated. And your point basically proves my point, once people stop agreeing with the dollar, it falls in value. The US can use weapons to try and force agreement, but can't do that to the whole world. Your argument implies that that's why the US went to war with Iraq. I would say it had a lot more to do with other reasons than iraq wanted to switch to a different currency for oil. But I'm sure it was one of the reasons.

Are you being vague on purpose? I don't see how Iraq is a good example. Feel free to extrapolate.

I totally agree. And again it goes back to agreement. What the boss says, everyone agrees to and gets busy implementing. However CEO's, at least the good ones, listen to their customers in order to serve them better (i.e. sell them more stuff to make more money for shareholders).
So while it would be more effective to get to the CEO directly, if enough customers make enough noise, the CEO will hear them. If the person in power sees enough customers demanding a better way to send them money, they wouldn't say no. No company is going to say no to more money (well, most wouldn't).
