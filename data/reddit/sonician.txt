When it's only $30 a month for up to $10,000/day in transactions, that's a pretty low "fee"

Nice! It's always amazing that there are some incredible Redditors out there who never stop giving. Half that would have gotten me out of crippling debt left behind by my ex-wife, yet you were awesome enough to give it out. Impressive work!

Great to see so many new updates! Only request I have is more bank options for Interac deposit! I'm with a credit union, so I am unable to deposit funds this way.
EDIT: Thanks for the Gold! My first ever!

BitPay is zero fees, just a monthly price all-inclusive:

Since no one else did, I just sent them this:

I've been out of the loop for a bit. 
Is there an ELI5 for Bitcoin Unlimited?
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:30:27
This is what I did last time. Dropped $1k on 1 BTC and then well, you know...
Good luck
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:42:51
now down to $950-ish! 
Congrats! We both have the same power!
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:37:38
Mine dropped about 60% of it's value in a few months. 
I hope you don't have the same luck.

It's unreal, the attitude and smug reactions to legitimate concerns about mass adoption. That's what BTC used to be all about.  Now it's just hungry big money players who don't seem to give a shit about the average user. 
This will be BTC's ultimate demise, that those most involved, can't see how limited it's use will always be, unless attitudes completely change.
I agree with what you're saying 100%, but I feel the smaller voices are getting stamped out.

I can buy a $2.00 coffee with zero fees using my debit or credit card.

I'm having awful flashbacks to 2013, the comments all sound so familiar....

Until the masses are accepting of Bitcoin, and can easily transfer to and from it, BTC will remain a niche, with artificial inflationary periods.
While people in this sub seem to think it's the next great thing, people have been saying that for nearly 5 years, but it's still not hit mass adoption rates yet. 
It's a bit of an echo chamber here, and so this will probably get buried, but it's important to realize that 95%+ of the population either has no idea about BTC at all, or are only aware of it in their peripheral.

Ask me how I did when I bought 1 BTC at the first $1000 ATH, then it dropped by 1/3rd, so I switched it all out to Blackcoin, which was also at an ATH, and then lost 90% of its value. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 03:18:04
They're not scarce, there were (literally) hundreds of thousands of them printed. Book value is only about $10, but for whatever reason, there's been a run on them. They'll be back down to $5-10 in a year or so.

As someone who worked at BB when the iPhone came out, it was a lot more than just this quote. The iPhone was seen as a toy by upper management, a toy that no one would ever want in place of a BlackBerry. It was dismissed as quickly as a king waves away a bad juggler in his court. 
I'd put it up there with the biggest business fuck ups in history. No question.

I've refreshed a dozen times, and it still just says:






I've had a pending withdrawal since April 25th with them to my Canadian bank. Getting nervous.

Finally got myself into it this week. Still waiting to move some money over, but I managed to get a paper wallet today. No regrets about getting in "late". Onward and upward. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:34:44
I saw that too, and wondered about the delay. The next round of difficulty would work out to about 7.8 coins per month with a 300 GH/s hash rate. But I also (I think) understand that the difficulty increases approximately every 14 days. 
I suppose, taking all of that into account, these cards would take much longer to pay for themselves, unless the value of a BTC goes through the roof, and counter-balances the difficulty somewhat. 
I think.. :)
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:46:00
I asked that question as soon as I saw the update. They're definitely moving to bill payments. I think it was issues with Fintrac, not to mention a logistical nightmare.
Disappointing either way. I used the cash deposit just last week and it was awesome.

I am working towards using BitCoin as an investment tool. 
My hopes are to pay off the crippling debt my ex-wife left me when she took off with another man. She racked up about $25K in CC debt because she was a secondary card holder. Left me to foot the bill. 
Then last year, I was laid off for five months, and the severance I received, which I'd hoped to use for the remaining debt, had to be used to cover me off while I looked for new work. So now I'm back to where I started. 
Even getting into BTC this late, I'm hopeful that it will work out. Because I'm running out of options.

Ran into the same problem with QuickBT today. The new TD Debit Visa cards can't be accepted. Just a heads up that, from what I understand, the rest of the major banks are switching to Visa/MC debit within the next 12 months as well.
I spoke with TD today, and the customer support rep stated they "may" be able to link an old debit card to my account as well, but that I'd have to go to the branch for that.

I have joined you today as well, partly due to that article, partly because I'm tired of missing out. 
I'm going to spend some time reading everything to the right first, before asking any kind of dumb questions. 
I am one who fully underestimated the entire thing. When I first heard about it a couple of years back, I actually had some freed up cash that I could have used to purchase a large amount of BitCoins. But I never really looked into it, never spent the time to "get it". 
I regret that now. :)
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:36:59
Thanks for this, it really paints a (totally) different picture.
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:06:16
Not sure why all the downvotes. Apple won't read a thread on Reddit. They will however respond to submissions to the company directly.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:06:00
Supply and demand, would be the simplest answer. As long as there is more demand than available supply of BTC, the price will continue to increase. 
From what I've learned, the demand is still in it's infancy, limited to a small subset of the global community.

I'm in Halifax, so it would be a bit of a drive ;)
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:31:57
I posted this in both as the main sub has a much larger audience, including lots of us Canucks. :)

Wow, that's glorious.
If anyone hasn't done the math, that's almost $150,000,000 at the current rate.
I wish I had .005% of that..

Wow, 20 minutes to full validation on my account. That's amazing!

The problem that it faces now is that the perceived value of an individual Bitcoin is going to start pushing out the average person from purchasing them, and they'll be bought up by high-end investors and corporations.
As the general public becomes more aware, (almost) no one's going to want to spend $50 on .180135 Bitcoins. (as an example), regardless of where the price settles.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:59:59
My story is likely one you are familiar with. I want to use Bitcoin to pay off my crippling debt.
See, I was married, and when my ex-wife was caught cheating on me, she made sure to leave me a present, she racked up $23K in debt on our credit cards before she took off with him.
I worked hard to try to pay it down (the cards were in my name, she was just a secondary card holder), and was about 50% done when I was laid off last year. My severance would have bee enough to pay off the balance, but it took me almost 5 months to find something good enough to support myself. (I took a couple of low-paying IT contracts in between to try to make ends meet).
In the end, I found a new job, but am now back to where I started, I'm just a few years older now. 
So anything you (or anyone else) can do to help, would be awesome. 
I'm turing 40 soon, and will never be able to retire. I managed to invest the last $1000 I had to my name into BTC when it was around $1000/BTC, but even that'S underwater at the moment.

Everyone in this thread who's abandoning iPhone and the like, should submit this to Apple, along with posting it here. 
It's pretty awful that a company who built itself on being different, can't allow for people to use different products. 
This is yet another reason I'm firm in my choice in having never bought an Apple product. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:50:16
I'll make you feel better, with my paltry .15658 BTC. Wishing there was a faster way for Canadians to buy BTC (other than LocalBitcoin which is way overpriced at current rates).

Already am frugal. No cable, only Internet and cell phone. Canceled home phone. But when CC payments (min payments) and rent take up ~70% of my monthly pay, there's not much more I can do.
