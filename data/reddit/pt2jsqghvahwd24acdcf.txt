I currently have 3micro bitcoins reaped from coinad. I'm a bit better than the OP but anything would be appreciated to 1MR3JtJdu3xQ7qUYHZDkJpxBaKhjLYhyuH.
Blockchain has wallets for smartphones which is a good way to keep your cash in your pocket but you still have to make an offline backup of your keys.

Paying to bypass filters in emails has been tried a thousand times. Do you see it today? No, it failed for a reason.
@_date: 2012-12-16 10:28:51
Thank you very much. I'm wondering what I should do with that much money, that was unexpected!
Edit: I know, that was obvious, I'll create a few paper wallets/coins a gifts for Christmas!

Can't you just GTFO of Dubai? I would because there is no death penalty for random stuff where I live.

We seem to be flooded with Orange employees right now :D My shitty connection disagrees (when it's not remotely cut twice a year by mistake). 
You live in a big city? Awesome, but the rest sucks.

By institution do you mean having an account on a server where "coins" would be added and removed outside of the network, and that you can withdraw to minimize the fee?
@_date: 2013-05-13 21:37:57
South of France, 100 kbytes/s. Orange: not a fuck is given and they won't for the next few years since it costs too much.
Fiber where I live? Yes but in 20 years. They have absolutely no incentive to upgrade right now.

Weird, your girlfriend demands cash whenever we meet...
@_date: 2013-02-20 06:37:09
But what is the point of having all those "satoshis" in one coin? I thought that coins were divided for the purpose of exchanging very small amount of money if desired. I'll have to study this...

I demand an explanation, and some coins!

It's downvoted because you don't provide the algorithm. Encryption through obfuscation is bad.

What OS are you using? Ruby comes from  and can be used from the command line. I'll try to tell more tomorrow.

This does not make any sense, at all, ever, in any physical or spiritual dimension.
@_date: 2013-04-28 12:03:23
No because it's not secure even though they say it is. They have the code, I don't. Also that's a dumb idea but it's just MHO.

For me the only "problem" with bitcoins is the miner's fee and the fact that micro-transactions are not possible. Why would a coin be divisible in satoshis if I can't send 1 satoshi to a friend?
I like the idea as a whole but I'll I have to document myself on those fees...
@_date: 2013-06-07 12:35:10
If it's still closed source, I don't see the point.
@_date: 2013-03-05 22:08:47
Lack of micro-transactions. I know it's technical and can't be avoided, but it's annoying: why can't I send just 1 satoshi if it's a valid value?

Kevin Rose is not "cool" and no one wants him, especially since he closed his last social network (Proctlr? Plumbrz?)

36 15 Ula was innovating, right... I've spoken with researchers who used it for their network, and they all agreed it was a POS.
@_date: 2013-02-22 06:37:39
Thanks for the explanation.
@_date: 2013-04-26 05:27:03
Everyone knows this, at least that's what I learned during my cryptography lessons in college. Also blacklists of debit cards dumped in POS, and more random conspiracy involving lizards from outer space.

The French Internet. We're still ashamed about it, and this monopoly is the reason that I still don't have decent DSL where I live.
@_date: 2013-05-13 21:45:02
Except that it was not free at all and you paid local communications (unheard of in the USA) + the price of the service. Thanks for trying anyway.

I know what patents are. But I don't think you have patented the idea of scanning something, too expensive for such a stupid idea.
@_date: 2013-06-01 15:29:35
Bad idea, I doubt it's legal. And even if it was, it's not culturally accepted and you might have people who refuse your money. So, a dumb idea.

I like both iOS and Android, but there has been more apps pulled from Google's Play Store than Apple's AppStore. They are both overlords in their own way: with Apple it's before you enter, with Google you're randomly kicked out of the store and you don't get your money back.
@_date: 2013-05-29 07:13:46
It's like saying that the Internet is open source because HTTP. The OP should learn what open source really is.
