You mean Visa/MasterCard/AMEX, where I pay between 0 to negative 2% fees on all transactions because of cashback? Yeah that's a pretty big industry with lots of demand

I think that will be hard given the nature of cryptocurrencies, it's much better suited as a debit instrument.
There are just so many challenges:
* Volatility, prices need to be stable, if nothing else than to save the cost of printing price tags every 2 hours or buying fancy electronic ones
* Disputes, people like that they can potentially get their money back if they get bamboozled, which goes against the whole immutable nature of cryptocurrency
* Transaction speed (+ volume), partially solved already depending on which currency
* Buy now, pay later &lt; I don't understand this one since I use my CC's like I would use a debit card, full balance autopays at the end of every billing period, but apparently this is a "feature" people like
But I mean, if I really think about it, does any of this even need a blockchain? what benefit does it bring? Any credit-like implementation on top of a blockchain necessarily involves a (centralized) lender, which immediately negates any benefit of decentralization, and if they're lending, you better believe they're doing a credit check, so not anonymous anymore. If they want to preserve the ability to do chargebacks or prevent fraud, they will be holding all the funds in escrow, so forget immutability. At that point we may as well go back to the current systems, because the only benefit the public blockchain would bring is that everyone in the world can verify that you spent ~~$54~~ ~~$75~~ $69 at that sex toy shop at 2am.

actually I get negative 5% on some things! And yes I do ecommerce the merchant pays flat amount (5-30c) + 1.5-3% depending on type of card used. The issuing bank keeps most of it and passes some onto visa/mastercard/whoever is doing the processing. However, interchange does not even come close to covering the cost of the rewards program the banks do, in fact most of that negative 2% comes from financially illiterate borrowers running a balance on their card and paying that sweet sweet 30% interest to the bank. If people stopped carrying a balance, these rewards programs would shrivel and die overnight unless interchange was raised, and big merchants will have none of that.
But yes, places also end up raising the price of everything slightly to compensate, but since I'd be paying the same amount in cash anyway, as far as I'm concerned its a negative 2% transaction fee.

actually a lot of the cashback is funded by interest payments of the 60% of people who are idiots and carry a balance on their credit card, paying 30% interest, as well as late fees and other ways banks fleece the ignorant public.^[1]
So typically interchange fees are SLIGHTLY lower than the cashback you get from the card, so regardless of who is carrying the burden of that (the store may raise prices 1.5%) it's still effectively a negative transaction fee, even if its only making you 0.1%. However, most places also don't give a discount for paying cash so to your average person it may as well be the full negative 2% as far as they're concerned.
Regarding PCI-DSS, I heard 3.2 is now enforceable as of Jan 31 but to be honest with you I just use stripe so I don't really have to know or care much about it lol, I'm sure compliance is a pita, have fun with that
