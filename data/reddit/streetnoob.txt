Surely you have similar theories for Bitcoin dynamics, and have received praise from the scientific community for it. Right?
@_date: 2015-06-20 19:37:02
So you think the network can handle 1mb, but not a single byte higher? What's so magic about 1mb? And you don't think there is a risk of Bitcoin being harmed when people have to pay $10 or $100 fees just to have their transactions confirmed?

Says the "ether miner".
@_date: 2015-06-20 19:17:45
You can use something else too if you want a permanent 1mb limit. Bitcoin was not designed to have that.
@_date: 2015-06-15 12:11:06
Oh I think they have done this plenty of times, you don't need to worry about that.

To the dark moon!

Packet size has nothing to do with block size, since there is no artificial limit on the bandwidth that those packets can use per node, while blocks are limited because it's one every 10 minutes on average. Silly comparison.

Maybe he didn't want to waste time on that? Everyone knows Satoshi didn't program like he had unlimited resources; there were many unfinished things in the code. And he explicitly said later on the 1mb limit could be easily removed by adding a simple rule like "after block XYZ, there is no limit". So don't act like that wasn't his plan.

Nice try, moderator of @_date: 2015-06-24 11:42:15
Actually he did explicitly say that there should be no limit eventually. I don't have the quote at hand but it was posted the other day.

By running a full node with the version you support.

Says Viacoin dev.
@_date: 2015-06-20 18:58:25
You seem to imply that everyone agreed to the previous things, like the 21 million cap. Did you miss all the people crying that currencies must have monetary inflation? Ever heard of doge?
Bitcoin can't please everyone in the world.
@_date: 2015-06-20 19:45:21
Blockstreamcoin is a scam.
@_date: 2015-06-15 12:17:18
Go ahead. I mean, you guys already created buttcoin.org and r/Buttcoin, so why not? But did you know each bitcoin was worth $4 when r/Buttcoin was created?
@_date: 2015-06-24 11:23:23
Go ahead, who cares? And why would anyone announce they are going to sell? Makes no sense, unless you are a drama queen like Peter Troll.
@_date: 2015-06-20 22:42:12
1mb supporters (blockstream devs mostly) love to spread FUD about full-nodes dropping over time, but it turns out it was a lie:

Here comes the buttcoin upvote brigade.
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:14:22
Literally anyone can put some money into a shitcoin and make it seem like it's "growing". And of course the idiots fall for it every time, and come spam the shit out of this sub.
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:21:41
Yeah, you just wait another week (tm).

The graph starts at 6700 instead of 0. Blockchain.info is horrible for graphs.
@_date: 2015-07-05 17:59:03
What is that from?

Who is Atko?
@_date: 2015-07-08 00:04:22
How does that change anything? What's your point?
@_date: 2015-07-08 00:38:27


You mean like exactly what butters do to bitcoiners?


Someone else submitted it but it was removed for not having "np" subdomain, and I thought it was relevant enough to resubmit it, considering how much this sub is attacked by trolls like rydan.
@_date: 2015-07-08 00:08:43
You have asked the same question many times in the past, and you were told you didn't have to do anything, your coins are safe.
@_date: 2015-07-08 22:50:12
Thanks for everything! By the way, people like sanswork are known trolls (he also trolls every Bitcoin article in Hacker News, under the same username), it's safe to completely ignore them.

What is it with these guys wanting to control all the forums? They are like fucking politicians.

Because becoming wealthier is bad, am I right? Doesn't matter if you help humanity in the process.
@_date: 2015-07-08 02:32:23
Your comment is not news...
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:28:50
Actually I made much more than that over the past years with Bitcoin alone (only buying). But you can continue gambling on shitcoins if that's what you are into. Because a different logo makes all the difference, right?
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:25:31
Devaluation is a hidden tax that Bitcoin prevents.

The future of copy/paste?
@_date: 2015-07-09 03:35:51
How dare people decide what to do with their own money and body.
@_date: 2015-07-08 22:48:03
The thing with these services that became possible with Bitcoin is that only a small percentage of its users can take legal action. Eg: There's nothing someone in China can do if Cryptsy is in the US (I think that's where it was). But that doesn't mean companies are free to steal from everybody; other companies are already in big trouble because people filed complaints, hired lawyers, etc. This is where trolls come out of the woodwork and say that libertarians want anarchy, but then they go crying to the police. But libertarianism has never been about removing the police and the justice system. In the future, it will be common for people to require certain crypto assurances from services before using them, which might lower the need for police, but for now they are still needed for these things.
