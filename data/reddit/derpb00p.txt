Theres one at 30 Yonge in Gateway News Stand if you are in the core. No ID, no cell, no fingerprint or picture. I think its rather new. I am unwilling to give my cell number

Depending where you are in Canada, goto an Bitcoin Machine.

Coinbase... i tried to deposit 2k so i could get some btc. I attached a corporate account to my CB account, verified it. I have tried to load cash into the CB account so i could have quick release of coins, got frustrated then tried to simplay buy btc with the account knowing they would hold it for x amount of days. Neither works. Now when i attempt to purchase i get a "You are currently unable to buy bitcoins. Please contact support." So, i have verified my email, my phone, profile done, payment method setup but cant do the 1 thing i showed up for, buy BTC.  I sent an email to support asking 2 simple questions, 1, why cant I buy BTC and the second, what laws am i bound to while using their service as a Citizen of Canada. I give up, i continue to use LocalBitcoins

Goto a Bitcoin ATM. Where are you located?

good luck finding machines online, open, not broken, not sneaking pictures of you, asking for your cell phone, ID or fingerprint. Most are down, most dont answer their phone. I been buying from 1 machine exclusively with great luck and though sometimes block chain is slow to confirm i have 0 issues

tobitcoin.ca they have machines. i know their % is up there when buying but super discreet and machines seem to always be up and running. largest i have bought there was over 2k a while back, typically $100-300 every week.
