Yes. And the "Steam" post on the first page has over 1000 upvotes. Something's fishy...
@_date: 2016-04-22 18:59:00
Please elaborate.

Maybe you think traders are bad for bitcoin, I don't know. But even a telemarketer would understand that stuck transactions are bad for bitcoin's value.
@_date: 2016-04-11 06:14:38
Sounds like you try to pretend that there is no conflict. Core has been blocking scaling for a long time. And they will keep doing it until they get fired.
@_date: 2016-04-22 17:11:23
Sir, that's true. There are many Classics fans in China as well as here in the west. Not sure what you mean that the questions are "stacked". Enlighten me, please?

I'm not saying libsecp256k1 isn't good. But it's not increasing the max 3-7 tps. The limit is still there, no matter how fast validation is. Blockstream/parts of core is intentionally holding bitcoin back.

2 mb is just a political, negotiated number. Classic has dynamic block size limit bitpay style in the road map. And Xtreme Thinblocks etc developed by the bitcoin unlimited team will be merged into Classic code. I think Classic is just the pry bar needed to get the definition power out of the power hungry hands of Blockstream. Bitcoin Unlimited is a more long term solution. Blockstream can fiddle with side chains and lightning on the sideline while other team scale on chain.

This interpretation from bitconnect.co is clearly angled. Read the source and make up your own mind here:

Great work! (But still waiting for mobile support of Trezor...)
@_date: 2016-04-22 19:34:39
Do you believe that large miners and pools think 2mb blocks are a bad idea? Are you scared of a fork to Classic?
@_date: 2016-04-22 21:14:38
That was really not an answer to my question. You sound unhappy and scared of a hard fork to Classic. Why are you afraid of change and progress?
@_date: 2016-04-11 14:43:41
Yet, they are choking tx capasity. None of us can read the mind and motives of the institutions owning Blockstream.
@_date: 2016-04-22 21:35:45
I don't see bloatware as progress, sorry.
@_date: 2016-04-11 13:00:54
The max 3-7 tps is still there. Blockstream and parts of core is intentionally holding bitcoin back. How many months/years does it take for you to see that?
@_date: 2016-04-12 19:13:35
It was in Hong Kong, not Beijing. And the bribes was never proven.

If you contact Samson Mow publicly on twitter, it's probably more likely that you get your coins back.

I'm sure Kyley Torpey is butthurt by Gavin's question, but he is not a very important player and not very relevant. It's so cool to see the chinese community gather around common sense in the epic AMA they had with gavin here (50 pages of good dialog): 
@_date: 2016-04-20 17:05:12
Xtreme thin blocks using bloom filters is invented by Peter Tschipper and implemented in BU. It is also comming to Classic. Learn about it from this great video by Chronos:

Yes. It's not a problem now.
@_date: 2016-04-22 19:22:24
The word "consensus" actually existed before bitcoin. Gavin is using it in the traditional way. He is not claiming that most miners and pools are mining with bip 109. That would just be silly.
@_date: 2016-04-19 08:45:34
How many people that was in the Beijing meeting did you talk directly to?
@_date: 2016-04-11 13:46:26
You are. Stop it.
@_date: 2016-04-11 13:21:44
I have no further comments to that, as I would just be repeating myself.
@_date: 2016-04-18 07:20:22
I think the lack of positivity is because of the current blocksize conflict. Transaction numbers can't boom with the current roadmap from core. Next time we bump the head in the roof and transactions get stuck in mempool, the price will take a dive.
@_date: 2016-04-19 08:04:49
Samson Mow was your primary source. He was not in the meeting. And his personal opinions were your "secondary sources". Check out Samson Mow's twitter account to get an impression of how reliable he is as a source:

What an epic AMA! 50 pages, lots of interesting stuff. Giving good insight to how the chinese community thinks. And made possible by the bitcoin community volunteering, 6 people organizing and translating back and forth between english and chinese. Building bridges between east and west. Bitcoin at it's finest. I'm just blown away!
@_date: 2016-04-11 10:08:05
I agree that the max blocksize should have been increased in 2015. It should be obvious to people now that Blockstream is actively holding bitcoin back by limiting the transaction capasity artificially. The current work on scaling bicoin on-chain is done by other dev teams for other implementations of bitcoin (Xtreme thin blocks, headers first etc.). We will not get rid of core until the price take a deep dive and the miners reconsider the code they are running. The quicker this happens, the better. After this painful process, bitcoin will go to the moon.
@_date: 2016-04-11 13:10:51
Stick to the subject.
@_date: 2016-04-11 14:04:31
The throughput limit is still 3-7 tx per second, like it has been for years. Blockstream is just feeding people with false promises and bloatware. This limit will not be liftet much, if anything this year unless miners choose to run different software. Bitcoin has the potential for massive, exponential growth, but is being held back by people with interests to see it fail, or at least slow it down.
@_date: 2016-04-22 20:22:38
We'll just see what happens next time transactions get stuck in mempool and the price take a dive while the miner reward is half of what it was...

They have not provided real world scaling. We still have the same limitations, even though validation is quicker. It's all smoke and mirrors in their effort to hold bitcoin back with their choke hold. You will hear a lot of excuses from core/Blockstream in the comming months. Delay of promised code, lack of adoption, you name it. This is just a part of the tactics to stall our belowed coin. The proof is in the pudding. And they are not delivering results, even though this whole issue could have been solved long time ago. TPTB are attacking bitcoin in a sneaky way. Core is compromised. But miners will not understand this until the price take a dive and change dev team.
@_date: 2016-04-22 20:17:27
It's just two sides of the same (bit)coin. Core will try to stall and prevent bitcoin from growing as long as they can. The next time transactions get stuck in the mempool, the price will take a serious dive. And make the miners desperate. With the choice between bankruptsy or Classic. After that? Moon! ┗(°0°)┛
@_date: 2016-04-09 16:05:29
You don't have to change the bitoin code to make it adaptable to future lightning og other "level 2" solutions. Just make the level 2 soultions first, and then we can adapt bitcoin to it.
@_date: 2016-04-18 15:04:30
Transaction count is important for usability. And usability is important for price. You know this, but will never admit it. Just watch the price take a dive next time the blocks are full and transactions get stuck.
@_date: 2016-04-11 16:48:12
Prove your claim that I don't understand what scalability is.

@_date: 2016-04-22 21:25:35
I am very optimistic for bitcoin and confident that our great honey badger will prevail. The price might have to take a dive to put Blockstream on the sideline, but after that it's free to grow. Sort of like removing a band aid. And please don't fake-quote me on that it will all fall apart. I don't believe that, and I never wrote that.
@_date: 2016-04-22 20:43:35
Do you think the exponential transaction growth the last five years will stop and flatline? And is that a good thing?
@_date: 2016-03-29 19:49:35
Clever, I enjoyed your comment ;)
@_date: 2016-03-29 15:58:21
Full blocks and stuck transactions the next months will make the price go down because nobody wants to invest in a system that is allready full. The price drop will make the miners desperate and eventually mine Classic blocks. Is there any way to prevent this from happening?
@_date: 2016-03-29 23:50:58
Agreed, the tiny price fluctuations are business as usual. And so are the full blocks now. As long as we hover just below the ceiling, we will bump the head from time to time, and transactions will get stuck in the system. The only thing that is certain, is that we will not continue to increase the numbers of transactions like we have done the last seven years. Because we have bumped into the artificial limit.
