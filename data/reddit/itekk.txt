I didn't purchase a single piece of furniture outside of a desk on clearance, and a $30 nightstand until I was over 30, and in my 4th apt/house. Friends, family, and the side of the road for the win.

I believe they were referring to wage stagnation, and not the gender pay gap.

That seems to be a misconception. Just because we don't measure stuff in cm doesn't mean that we don't learn the prefixes. Additionally, there are things not covered by our dumbass system and use the same scheme, like watts. We understand how many meters 4 kilometers is. We just don't usually know how many miles that is, because that's not typically useful information in our daily lives.

They just sent an email out yesterday that, among other things, mentioned that identity verification was moving slowly right now due to a huge surge in new users.

Can you not get a gov't issues ID card that's not a DL or passport? Will coinbase not accept ID if it's not one of those? In the US, if you aren't eligible for a DL, you can get a generic ID card issued to you for exactly this scenario.

Didn't bits already make a claim on that moniker?

I mean, call it what you want brother. I'm only here pointing out that contrary to popular opinion, muricans know that kilo means a thousand.

IDK man, all the Average Joes I know seem to be well aware of the difference between kilo, milli, centi. I'd not be surprised if they didn't know exactly how many decimals past that things are, but then again, most people don't typically measure nanometers.
Also, if you re-read your comment that I replied to, I was specifically replying to your implications that it is not taught in our schools. OC is incorrect that we wouldn't understand it well. I do agree that renaming it as such would be a marketing hurdle in America.

Correct. These would be unrealized gains until that point.

You just dodged his point though, as you still need to buy one whole share of an ETF. People think of it as a stock because they see it as an investment. Describing it accurately as a currency should be easier to digest. Owning a portion of a share is foreign to people, but owning a fractional amount of a dollar is a common concept.

That wasn't very clear, the post is a question about eating the fees for selling B2X and buying BTC with it. 
Per Coinbases FAQ, you will receive an amount of B2X equal to the amount of BTC you have. You can trade the B2X on Coinbase. This all holds true for GDAX as well.

They are both common variable types in many programming languages. INT is an integer, a whole number with no decimal point. A float is a floating point number, a number that can be fractional with a decimal point.
You have to define the type of variable before you can assign a value to it. If the number is never intended to be fractional, it is more efficient to define that as an integer, and if you wanted to make that capable of fractional numbers, you would first need to redefine that variable type.
edit: grammar - also I know very little about how the blockchain works, they are just some pretty basic variable types.

Within the authenticator app there's an option to move it to a new device. That will give you a QR code to scan with new phone to set up the same authenticator. If you lose or break the phone, I don't know. That happened to me once years ago, but the only thing I had TFA on was a couple game logins that I was able to get turned off.

Guess I ought to get in the habit of reading those more info arrows, I might have understood the joke and not looked like an idiot today.

But the difference is the guy in the bar doesn't have his own football team to manage. McAfee is actually rich.
