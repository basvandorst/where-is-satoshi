It depends on your timeframe. Everyone has a different investment time horizon. If you're in it for the long haul, I suggest dollar cost averaging.

To answer the question of where to buy BTC would depend on your country as each country all have their own places to purchase crypto from. As for the cold storage wallet, you may want to consider using a paper wallet for that amount. Just make sure you don't lose that sheet of paper.

I agree that there's risk involved, just as is the case with all investments. 
However, to say that it's an "unnecessary risk" is your opinion that others may not agree with. Assuming that Celsius has the $4.25 billion in deposits as they say, that's hard to argue against the facts that there are people out there who don't deem it to be an "unnecessary risk."

Just dollar cost average. Just think about how much you're willing to buy in TOTAL and then divide that by equal increments. For example, if you want to spend $1000 on BTC in TOTAL, then divide $1000 by the frequency and you'll then get a number as to how much you should buy each time. Most people would say to dollar cost average weekly so if you use that example, take the $1000 and divide that by 52 and it'll work out to be about $20/week.
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:37:37
It depends on your risk tolerance. Nothing is ever as easy as that Yes or No when it comes to investing. Risk and reward are always things to consider. You need to ask yourself, are you willing to lose 100% of that money for POTENTIALLY massive gains like we saw back in 2017. If yes, then buy them. If no, then don't buy.

You can definitely buy smaller fraction of a Bitcoin. That's the beauty of it, a whole BTC can be divided by 8. For example, you can buy 0.01086957 ($100 worth @ $9200/BTC).
@_date: 2019-10-30 20:20:49
BTC has a low supply due to its known finite amount. With dollars for example...because it's no longer backed by anything except for trust in the government that they will honor their debt obligations, the amount can change over time at the will of the government's central bank. Once you learn about how money works or monetary policy....you'll get a better idea of why Bitcoin makes sense.

If you store your bitcoin on a wallet, you will not be able to really actively trade them. If you leave them with an exchange, you can trade them but then you lose control over the coins as the exchange could close shop and take your coins with. There will always be a tradeoff between convenience and security.
@_date: 2019-10-25 11:36:14
Well....it depends on what specifically. With Bitcoin...I'd say that people need to be well versed in 4 subjects to really understand the concept of Bitcoin and why we need it/why it makes sense to have it: Technology/coding, economics, politics, and history. That's just my opinion though.

I would say it's okay. Coinbase is a trusted company and so I think that's an acceptable amount. If 1K is a lot to you, then move the coins to a wallet where you own the private keys.

If you want to make a lot of money fast with BTC...then you'll also need to risk a lot. IF you're willing to risk a lot (and potentially lose 100%), then my suggestion is to go ALL IN on Bitmex @ 100X leverage and HOPE it goes up and you don't get liquidated. That's one way you could approach it. You need to accept the risk that comes with the reward.

Difficulty adjusts every 2 weeks or so. If fewer miners are mining, difficulty will lower to help reach a new equilibrium. This was a question that was raised before back in previous halvenings.

The Coinbase wallet is probably a good one for what you're looking for.
@_date: 2019-10-27 15:44:33
If there's no transaction ID, it probably hasn't been processed yet then is my guess. Apparently after the spike in price, one block took 3 hours for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:34:25
Perhaps check out Bitfinex. I'm not sure if they're available in Spain but I do know that there's USD/BTC pairs.
@_date: 2019-10-26 23:57:41
Depends on the country that you're located in.

Which country are you from?
@_date: 2019-10-31 10:24:10
You could do that, and it's called scalping. But you also need to realize that it can go down just as fast. There's a saying in trading, bulls take the stairs up, and bears jump out the window. I.E. price climbs up the stairs, but price takes the escalator down.

If you're interested, I made a video called "When and how much crypto should I buy?" for my YouTube channel. It may be of interest to you if you're new to crypto. You can watch the video here: [

With altcoins, as they've got a lower market cap, the price can be easily moved by some whales. Having said that, there's greater reward with it along with more risk involved. You have to decide for yourself if that risk with worth the reward.

That all depends on what you think will happen with the price of Bitcoin. If you think it'll go up then now's the time to buy. If you think it'll go down, then now's not the time to buy.
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:16:15
Seems like there is much for me to learn still!

I know of a site in Canada where you can set an autopilot to buy btc and a few alts. If you're not in Canada...can't help you.
@_date: 2019-10-25 15:51:23
I never said it would help you 100%. I said that it "MAY be of interest to you." No need to hate because you misinterpreted what I had written.
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:14:37
If you think the price will go up, buy. If you think it's going to go down, then wait. Personally, I would just buy $25 worth now and then see where the market goes and buy a little more when there's price movement.

You're right. That's exactly why in my video, I straight told people that if they use my referral code that I would be getting a kickback and that if they didn't want that, they didn't have to use it.
@_date: 2019-12-23 22:11:35
Ahhh okay. Honestly, just stick with them as they're much cheaper than coinbase. That's just my opinion though.
@_date: 2019-12-23 21:17:12
2017 was the year of ICOs. Pretty much most people got smart/more selective about buying them.

Just as the comments have stated, dollar cost averaging is your best bet. If you're not sure what that is, I made a video that may be of interest to you that you can check out here: [
@_date: 2019-12-23 21:52:35
Yes you can.
@_date: 2019-12-23 21:09:22
It depends on the trading pairs that you're looking at.
@_date: 2019-12-01 17:30:32
Sure. Do what works for you. Trading works for me so I'll continue with it.
@_date: 2019-12-06 13:23:30
May not be the "best way" but you can check out Brave browser. You'll earn BAT tokens that you can then exchange for BTC. If you're interested in learning more about the Brave browser, check out a video I made on it here: [ or you can download it [here](

Honestly, don't buy on Coinbase unless you're okay with getting charged a lot in fees. Two better alternatives to buy crypto within minutes are Coinberry and Shakepay. I've made tutorial videos on how to get started with them. If you're interested, you can get started here: 
@_date: 2019-12-23 21:18:49
It would depend on how much you're trading. You can check out their fees page here:  Every time your order goes through, you'll be charged with a fee.

So based on the fees chart, Coinbase will calculate how much you've traded. The first $10K they will charge 0.5%. After they will charge 0.35% until $50K of trades have been made. After that they'll charge 0.25% until $100K of trades have been made and etc. Look down the chart and you'll see how much they charge in fees. I personally think Coinbase is expensive which is why I don't use them.
@_date: 2019-12-05 23:46:05
Only put in amount you're WILLING TO LOSE into crypto. If $90 isn't what you're willing to lose, you've put too much in then.
@_date: 2019-12-01 16:35:35
You may want to check out tradingview. Not only can you track the price of BTC from an exchange of your choice but you can also set alerts as well. If you're unsure of what tradingview is, I made a video about it that you can check out here if you're interested: [

You first need to find someone who's willing to buy the Bitcoin off of you and will send you the money via PayPal. Check out local bitcoins for that. I've never used local bitcoins before but I've heard it's an okay service. Do your own research though.

I have personally been using Celsius for some time. I've been supplying USDC and have been getting paid every Monday. I've never had any problems with withdrawals either. If you're interested, check out a tutorial video I made on them here: [ Also, if you use the link in the description, you can earn $10 worth of BTC after depositing $200 USD worth of crypto and leave it there for at least 72 hours. I've told numerous people about it and we've all been paid out each time.
@_date: 2019-12-23 21:14:42
Yeah Coinbase is alright...they've just got high fees. I personally don't use them unless I have to.

Could be that the whales are putting in fake buy orders to get people to think that there is demand when in fact they wanna dump their coins on those who are that.

Crypto is definitely not for those who can't stomach massive swings to the up and downside. If you're in it for the long haul however, consider dollar cost averaging in. If you're not sure what that is, I made a video entitled "When and how much crypto should I buy?" that you can check out here: [
