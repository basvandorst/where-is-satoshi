It’s probably because they want you to get rid of your bitcoin and convert to real currencies like bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold so your money isn’t stuck in bitcoin forever and unmineable since bitcoin is no longer profitable to mine.

I used to think that too... but with no real sense of what the value actually is... can't really say that. It's not a security

Bitcoin won't go down. Maybe before the fork but it will be just like every other fork.. what makes this any different? They just want the money that's why they continue to make these dumb forks. Because these miners only care about one thing... and that's making money.

To me when they post these articles I just want to go buy A LOT MORE.

I'm sure it will continue to rise. They are fools to try and fight it rather than just embracing it... it scares them what they see because they can't control it. Stocks they can control crypto they can't... that's why they are afraid.

I wondered how long this would take. With billions pouring into cryptocurrency banks are going to start fighting back.. all the fees they are losing isn't going to sit well.

What the hell are you guys talking about? I live in US takes literally a day if I send my coins to coinbase and sell. Unless you're taking out large large sums of money. I'm not withdrawing 800k like you guys I guess?

There won't be a chain split it would literally ruin bitcoin everything will be fine. Segwit will implement and litecoin and bitcoin will surge really hard. Because all of the people sitting on the sidelines. Scrape em up while they are cheap. LITECOIN 60 dollars ahoy.

I think honestly they try and protect cryptocurrencies by making things up such as that. I cashed out of litecoin like 2 days ago it says it wasn't going to cash out till after August 1st then my transfer went through the next day. Vut I don't think they want people to sell and withdraw right now because it will make it crash.

You guys can't read. The only other supporter of it is a democrat from Hawaii which digital currency isn't allowed there anyway.
