Blockstream openly advocates high fees and slow conf. It's their business model.
Blockstream is funded with 55 million dollars by AXA / Mastercard / the Bilderberg group. The people who run fiat. They do much better business with Bitcoin crippled.
The true Bitcoin vision remains with Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin ABC "hard-forked" to retain an untainted Segshit-free code on August 1st.
But it's only a hardfork because the banks infiltrated and snuck in Segshit and perpetual 1mb blocks. Satoshi used 32mb at first in 2009. The mb blocks were always supposed to be temporary.
You thought the banks were going to roll over and die. You were wrong. 
Bitcoin Cash is the one true Bitcoin: same code,  bigger blocks, zero fees, 0-conf.
This sub is heavily censored. The r btc sub has no censorship.

The narrative on this sub is insane. You mean to say "only changes the sociopaths with the keys to the github accept." 
Your little group of thugs wants to keep Bitcoin small for as long as you can to keep your banker masters happy. A disgrace to humanity.

The miners are the executive branch. Always have, always will be.
Bitcoin only works because they fix the double-spend problem through a system of economic incentive.
Community "Consensus" is a lie. It's whatever Blockstream wants happen that happens, after manufacturing consent on their censored, controlled subreddits and sites bitcoin.org and r/bitcoin.

Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are both turing complete and allow the running of smart contracts on top of them. 
Vitalik first wanted to build Ethereum on Bitcoin. I think he reviewed his opinion because the fees were already getting too high, but it may have been another reason.
I hear it's more difficult to program smart contracts on Bitcoin, but companies like nChain promise to simplify this code / the process. This makes BCH a direct competitor with Ethereum.
Jihan Wu (big miner) says Bitcoin Cash's primary opponent is Ethereum. I'm not an expert on the matter,  but I listen intently when such people make such claims.
That's why I bought BCH. Seems like all the pieces are available to create a piece of software that has  vast ammounts of use-cases. With the killer apps remaining medium of exchange and store of value.

Bitcoin Cash definitely lost some volume to the actual ponzi BitConnect (BCC).
Bitcoin Cash is actually outperforming BTC %-wise if  you had not noticed.
The volume you are seeing is mostly Koreans going bonkers.

BCH has had full 8mb blocks and quite often has 2mb blocks. It's not a problem if the blocks are full. Satoshi said this too.
The entire "big blocks =  decentralized" argument is false. The Core devs keep saying that to retain power over Bitcoin Legacy. 
Bitcoin Cash runs fine. Bitcoin Unlimited even test-ran 1 gigabyte blocks which ran quite well.

1gb is not for today. But we could scale soon. And we need to scale soon. Bitcoin is competing with *everything* else. Act fast or die.
The first couple of years Bitcoin ran fine with only a handful of miners mining *millions* of coins. Miners get paid to secure the network. It would take a massive $$$ budget to seriously nefariously harm the network. 
The "big block bad, small block good"'- narrative is a lie used to keep control over Bitcoin. It's a pretext. 
This tactic gets used all the time in politics too. Present a law one way, use it in another. Like gun control. The government doesn't give a shit about your safety. They just want a monopoly on violence. But they sell it to you like "it's in your own best interest" to hand over your best tool of defense.

Yeah, no one visit r/btc. It's 100% shills and there is no reasonable conversation. 
r/btc is the sub that censors people. Do NOT visit it or read any of the threads. Danger!

Bitcoin is about peer-to-peer *electronic cash*. Read the whitepaper. It is impossible to be a store of value without also being a medium of exchange.
Bitcoin right now is a greater fool project.
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:28:07
If it's really a government takeover, just hard fork the project away.
Miners are only going to be interested in the project if it makes them money. I can't see any government spending massive ammounts of money in a chain that ends up dying over and over again.
Bitcoin is fool-proof against this scenario. So no worries. The most economically sound chain will always come out on top.

'Targeted' and 'shut down'.
To achieve these things one must use physical force or the threat of deadly force. It is impossible to 'shut someone down' without force.
You are advocating he be either thrown in a cage, physically intimidated or murdered. 
Not for causing physical violence. But for saying words. You want him physically harmed for expressing thoughts.
He's probably at home, sitting behind his computer. Harming not a single fly. Yet you propose he be physically harmed.
You are behaving cowardly.
