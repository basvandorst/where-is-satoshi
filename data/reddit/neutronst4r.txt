The article is hateful, pointless and unoriginal. It is widely known that politicians have little understanding of modern technology. The CSU especially is very conservative and will say anything to feed into the fears of the public, may it be financing terrorism or stopping refugees coming to Germany. Also... No sources. Bad article, don't upvote this shit.

It's kind of disgusting. Made me not want to read the article.
@_date: 2016-01-07 17:08:05
No, the article says:


Translation: According to an unpuplished paper held by "Die Welt" (a german newspaper), the CSU is planing to stop the fanancial sources of terorism.
It implies bitcoin is used by terrorists. Not that this would be the fault of bitcoin, but it is enough to flock the sheepish voters behind an apparent honest goal. Sadly the author of the article is doing exactly the same thing by trying to rally up bitcoin supporters with uninformed, hateful and - worst of all - sourceless information.

You overestimate the IT skills of a normal banker.

Adding more decimal places to the amounts Bitcoin can be traded in, does not inflate the currency, whereas printing more money does.

Is this just fantasy?

I think you are confusing inflation and deflation, but in any case... yes, its value would change due to normal market forces, but my point is... At absolutely no point will it ever become unpractical as a currency because of its value, because the value does not matter. It's value will never have any impact on how its physical form... because it has none.

But gold has one crucial flaw, that you are not taking into account. If you divide  any amount of it, it become physically smaller and at one point impossible to handle in day to day life. Digital currencies don't have that problem. Even, if 99.9% of all bitcoins would never move or be frozen, there would still be enough for everyone. You just have to make the standard reference smaller, which in this case it would mean hyper deflation.

Okay lets dissect this...


There is nothing artificial about it, it is simple supply and demand, regular market forces. There is a fixed amount of bitcoins, there can never be more. There is NO outside force controlling who gets more or less. There is no central authority.


First of all, if a fork happens, EVERYONE gets twice the amount of Bitcoins. The amount of numbers doubles, but the value they hold is halfed, at least in a 50/50 fork. You are correct, this is a form of Inflation, however it affects everyone equally.
In a fiat currency, where does the extra money go that gets printed? Do the banks go around and knock on everybodies door and give everyone their fair share? Hardly.
At best there is just a low permanent interest rate, at worst they bail out whole countries or to big to fail companies. You want to know what is philosophical wrong and why bankers are evil?
Compound Interest: It is the ability to make money from money without any value behind it and it disproportionally benefits those who already have a lot of money way more than it does poor people.
Compound Interest does not exist in bitcoin.

In German, they are called "Panzerknacker", which literally translates to safe breaker. Kind of unimaginative actually.
@_date: 2019-06-21 18:37:32
They are not breaking into tanks, they are breaking into safes and a safe is a "Panzerschrank" in German, i.e. an armoured cabinet. Calling them "Panzerschrankknacker" would have been a bit much, though, so I'd imagine they shortened it to "Panzerknacker". Also... "to bust" something does mean "to break" in some contexts, but your traditional secret robbery at night is usually not called "a bust"... it is called a "break in". A bust is usually something, that didn't work out as intended, i.e. a failed attempt at something. For example: a total bust, would be "ein totaler Reinfall" in German ( and not "eine totale Büste" :) )
Translations to and from English can be very hard sometimes, they use a lot of idioms that you just have to know.

They know perfectly well, what they are doing. Despite what many on this subreddit may want to believe, they don't have idiots working for them.
They just don't care about the fundamental principles of Bitcoin. They will do what they have been doing for decades: take shit, wrap it up and sell it. And it will work, people will buy it.
