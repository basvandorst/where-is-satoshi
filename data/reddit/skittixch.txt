when are you going to start accepting doge?

technically, a bitcoin can only be split into 8 decimal places.  It would undo the parabolic curve of production if they were infinitely divisible.

not an expert, but this is my understanding

you answered it yourself.  speculation.  Though honestly, I could see it continuing to climb.  Who knows where all of this is going to end up?

if your gmail acct showed signs of compromise, make sure you guys don't use the same password for other web services, there are a lot of ne'erdowells out there.
If you hadn't logged onto mtgox in the past few months, and you used a password that was less than around 8 characters, assume that every hacker/scammer/bored student currently has access to your credentials

nicely done!  This needs to be spread around.

coinpal is great for the beginner bitcoiner.  I made my first transactions there, and have continued with the otc market to more than double my USD investment.  Feels good man ;)

as of the time I'm posting this, we're sitting at block 145512.  Make sure you've given your client enough time to catch up with the blockchain.  I ran into the same issue a while back before I really understood how bitcoin worked

it looks like these numbers are passed as float, and they're producing rounding errors.  Anybody have an idea on how to turn them to decimal? (python nub)
