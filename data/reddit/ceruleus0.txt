Like a vendor on silk road, a seller's reputation is important when the buyer has no way of getting a refund.

Thanks for the info

Oh, no that's not the audience I am targeting with my list. It was for freelancers whose clients are individuals or indie game developers. They nearly always use paypal, whether they like it or not - if paypal is offered in their country.

There is no secret. I want to share this with people who haven't thought about cryptocurrencies and want feedback on this list.

This is interesting. Did you post the art anywhere? I am asking because I am curious how it turned out.
One thing I noticed is that a lot of btc commissions (and merchandise and even jobs paid in bitcoin) are meta, which kind of isolates us from the rest of the people who aren't familiar with bitcoins yet. Commissioning "bitcoin art" and paying with bitcoin is like asking an artist to draw a picture with the $$$ sign all over it, and then paying them in dollars. I want to see a point when cryptos are used to pay for commissions that were about something other than bitcoin itself, but how to get there is the question. Maybe the average person doesn't really have a *need* for cryptos yet (just like how the regular person back in the 90's didn't have a need for email when telephones and fax machines did the job).
Maybe what we can do is go around asking specific artists that we like, and ask them if they will be open to accepting bitcoins as payment for their work. But most people interested in btc aren't interested in commissioning art (unless it's about bitcoin but even then), and most artists aren't even aware of bitcoin yet (and are at the mercy of paypal, if it's provided).

Not quite correct, so you mean it depends. Does it depend on the country? Cryptocurrencies aren't regulated, at least not in the US, and I was told that whatever you buy/sell/earn in cryptos isn't taxable unless it was turned into USD, which *is* reported and regulated. Unless the person who told me this was dodging taxes himself.

ELI5 what forked coins are and will I be able to have them if I hold bitcoins in Core?

So having a degree of confidence despite (well intentioned) opposition is now being full of yourself? Alright then what would a "not full of yourself" reply look like?

Of course the second I buy it at 4200 it starts going back down to 4170 or something. ��

Post a picture (esp. of the chips) and we'll compare it to ours.

They mean well. Not everyone is a risk taker like us.

Thanks for the advice, saving this.

Bitcoin, like any other "high risk" investments, are exciting. I agree, and I hold retirement account and index funds as well. It's good to diversify and bitcoin is part of that.

I like they have their place. The reason a lot of people don't invest in bitcoin is because they don't understand the blockchain, it's too risky or speculative for their taste, and they're not that eager to really understand its potential because they're already happy with the other (and safer) options they have. For most people, who are risk averse and not as literate when it comes to technology, that sub does the job.
But yeah, I agree that **their knee-jerk reaction is silly, since their prejudice comes from ignorance**. They don't even know what bitcoin is besides what they heard about it, let alone how easy it is to hold a safe wallet. One time I asked an author's website manager if they had an option for me to donate or pay for forum access via bitcoin, and he said they can't accept bitcoin because they "didn't have the funds to build a mining rig" to accept bitcoin. That's not even how bitcoin works. I never replied back.

What the fuck, you gotta be kidding me. How is that even ethical? This is gonna cause a massive uproar. I am hoping my ledger nano arrives soon in October so I can withdraw the fuck out of all my exchanges.

I would've, if he wasn't so snarky about it. You can usually tell if someone will be receptive or not.

I am so sorry. Remember you're not alone in losing it over something "simple" (it's not always that simple). Bitcoin is still relatively new so you can still keep investing and make that money back quick in a couple years. At least you came out with one piece.
