I'm about fed up with this. Other than practicing better security, what can we do?

A good few of these coins are still profitable to mine... What exactly constitutes a dead coin? Does it need to be overvalued? Some coins just trade at a proper value without as much volatility, this should be a good thing.

I move it to the "back porch" where there are plenty of windows and it's rare that anyone will go out there. It's a bit toasty from time to time but with the windows open it cools down quick enough.

I use a mining rig for heat in the winter. My room is the toastiest in the place and I make money from it.

Research now which coins are not scams and continue to hodl them. For instance, Ethereum, Monero, and Vertcoin are all sufficiently useful to have value. Diversifying isn't a bad thing, what if you had bought those shitcoins all before the pump? Then you would be richer than just holding BTC.
Hindsight is 20/20. It doesn't make that much sense to eat the loss now, hodl what you believe in and sell what you don't. These things will rise again even if it takes years.

Use Litecoin or Vertcoin (both?). All coins are worth their fair-market value. Why be so devoted to Bitcoin if it doesn't give you what you need.

I bought a pretty expensive pizza earlier this year. Still worth it, I was really hungry.

I really have respect for the Vertcoin team. The whole community is very agile. Every time the people want something but politics block it (SegWit) people just get together and make it happen.
Vertcoin was going to UASF because someone was maliciously pumping non-SegWit. After seeing that, the miner stopped buying up hashrate to block and it passed because most miners who actually believe in the coin were already signalling.
I don't necessarily want SegWit for Bitcoin, but at the least Litecoin people could learn a thing or two.

Vertcoin uses what's called a scrypt-n algorithm (LyraREv2 at this time). The memory requirements for computation change every x(^2?) blocks so if you built an ASIC for it now, it would no longer out-compete GPUs in a year or so and you would have to make new ASICs. It's not completely resistant but it makes GPU mining (and CPU in the future) a lot easier/profitable when compared to constantly developing new ASICs.

I'm excited to be starting at RIT this fall where there is a Blockchain Club.
