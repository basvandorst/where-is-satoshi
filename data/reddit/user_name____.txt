Yes, gold price is manipulated, stock price is, house price is, food price is, and even bitcoin, this is how the game works

@_date: 2014-05-24 12:02:05

" If I buy with Bitcoin I have to go to my wallet, like Coinbase, and pay $101 to get $100 of Bitcoins, the extra $1 going to Coinbase, and pay the Bitcoins to Acme. Hopefully, the price of Bitcoin hasn't swung in the meantime to the point that $100 isn't enough anymore."
When I sent 1 btc, it is 1 btc. I don't understand any words he says.

I think discussing which commodity will be traded using bitcoin worldwide first would be more relevant. like oil, gold...

you are new to bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-05-21 04:04:06
@_date: 2014-07-13 12:23:37
this is illegal, but you can offer different price for fiat, like 2x of the bitcoin price.
@_date: 2014-05-27 06:16:55
when you store bitcoin, you are storing a set of private keys, which is in a file less than 1mb.
You can store it anywhere you want if it is heavily encrypted, even on dropbox.
@_date: 2014-09-15 00:56:17
oops i feel sorry for this

ok see you at the blockchain
@_date: 2014-05-22 07:40:08
be careful about the security of your wallet, if you lose the key you have nothing
@_date: 2014-05-26 09:02:37
You are mining bitcoin, which is securing the bitcoin network, together with other poeple(pool mining). And BlockChain.info helped you to create a wallet.
@_date: 2014-06-07 02:22:19
