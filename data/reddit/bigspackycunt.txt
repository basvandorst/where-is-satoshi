They will likely adopt a low fee, fast TX, decentralised crypto currency first, before 1st world therefore will get in earlier and benefit from gains

There's a very simple solution which could make it very fast and very cheap... although theoretical drawbacks have made it extremely controversial.. ;)

Have you ever heard of a "blockchain"?
@_date: 2018-05-09 09:22:21
Nice, but I'm just not convinced, sorry

This video represents the classic view of bitcoin very well, and It's still the view I hold. I completely agree bitcoin will be a great store of value when the price has stabilised (and it will during mass adoption), but this is not the only use of Bitcoin. 
It can't be the only vision if bitcoin wants to remain the top crypto currency, because if bitcoin loses its ambition to be a world CURRENCY, another coin will take the throne, and I hold that view with a lot of conviction

I live in the UK and no one accepts bitcoin. Also "5 of the top 500" suggests to me that those 5 may have been somewhere between number 500-495. 
Those arent particularly big retailers at all.

They need bitcoin. Bitcoin has the power to stop wars, I dont know how long you've been involved in bitcoin, but anyone whos been interested for a while knows all the benefits of bitcoin so I dont need to explain to you why its so lucrative for the third world.
And if they adopt before the 1st world which I believe they will, then they will benefit from having a larger share wealth than they currently have once bitcoin adoption dominates the world. Its very simple mathetmatics

You're perfectly entitled to that opinion, but dont forget that makes you just as much a speculator as I am, if you can predict the future that well
@_date: 2018-05-12 08:47:58
High fees make it a very good store of value
@_date: 2018-05-07 20:30:18

You have a gambling addiction 
@_date: 2018-05-07 20:31:06
i dont think you did cause i made this chart today
@_date: 2018-05-09 09:29:50
@_date: 2018-05-07 17:33:12
no one even uses bitcoin yet
@_date: 2018-05-07 20:32:33
thats why i said "close". speculators are madboys though, they will pump that shit way in advance. its good for adoption if it can stabilise before full usage anyway

Interesting bitcoin logo

Research it yourself I cant be bothered to explain to the 5% of people who dont get it. Beats me how anyone involved in bitcoin doesnt know of it's benefits already.
I just made the graph
