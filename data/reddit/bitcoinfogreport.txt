Good news, they did

The coins haven't disappeared, they just don't show up on the site. I can clearly see that the transaction went through and that the coins are at the associated address shown in the fog UI but the UI doesn't seem to think they are there. Since I haven't received word from support I'm posting here in case it is a site outage or other issue that others should know about.

I will totally let you know after a random amount of time...

Deposits should show up pretty quick, within an hour. Withdrawals are a different thing and that is where the mixing comes into play and spread out over 6+ hours. I'm talking about a single deposit here that hasn't shown up in 6+ hours now.

Ok, where does the money come from when you buy bitcoins from bitcoin.de if not a checking account or credit card?

I don't particularly want to meet people in a park or buy a mining rig that will be obsolete in 3 hours to get bitcoins. Which leaves using financial instruments that are tied to personal details and makes mixing services the best you can do as far as I know. If you have better advice by all means let us know.

My identity

I think working for a DPR style venture might be more dangerous than buying with coins tied to you personally and then mixing them.

A withdrawal, especially spread out over 96 hours is a different thing. If 98 hours haven't passed I wouldn't worry about it.

Alone I walked on the ocean strand,
A pearly shell was in my hand;
I stooped, and wrote upon the sand
My name, the year, the day.
As onward from the spot I passed,
One lingering look behind I cast,
A wave came rolling high and fast,
And washed my lines away.

Should be resolved now

I've used it dozens of times in the past. Even if this time doesn't work it's still preferrable to having all my coin transactions in the public ledger like a certain person who has recently been found guilty of certain things.
