The thing is, you would be surprised how much information you give about yourself, even if you try not to. I don't really give a fuck about karma... Privacy &gt; worthless internet popularity contest points. 
And I usually don't shill coins unless asked for an opinion, so I never had any problems with the new accounts.
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:35:37
I change my crypto reddit account every 3 months. It's called Opsec. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:38:52
Yeah I agree with that, but that's what downvotes are for.
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:23:37
Tbh I found the name rather shitty but I was lazy and already tried at least 10 that were taken.
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:15:12
Lol too much work, for what? Reddit karma? Srsly?
I'm doing this for a while now and have never been accused of shilling/astroturfing and if someone did, I wouldn't care. I'm not here to prove something, just to have good discussions. And if the other side wants to dismiss me based on the age of my reddit account and not on what I said, then he/she isn't worth it anyways.
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:43:05
Oh yeah I agree there defenitely is astroturfing happening here, I just wanted to say that you shouldn't dismiss everyone with a new account. Should have made that clearer.

Hey! I have two weeks left to live!

PSA: u/AnythingForSuccess is a well known FUDster/concern troll. His own poorly written all caps panic FUD threads instantly get downvoted to oblivion. So his newest trick is asking for peoples opinions and then posting the best answers as a new thread and [passing them off as his own]( Just so you know who you are dealing with.
EDIT: Of course the little fucker deleted his answers, but hey, I know him by now [so I took a screencap](
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:29:37


Yeah well I think we simply disagree there. I've had plenty of interesting discussions in the last three months, the age of my account has never come up. So I don't have the feeling that I've wasted my time (ok, this is reddit, i should say I haven't wasted my time more than usual).
Anyways, thanks for the heads-up, I know it is meant well.
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:58:54
Lol it's not precise apparently, I still have 2 weeks left!
@_date: 2017-07-12 04:34:49
I can recommend Jaxx as a decent beginner wallet on Android and Win, but I wouldn´t leave large amounts in it. If you put more than $1000 into crypto you should get a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:13:41
Oops just noticed that I recommended to buy 1 or 2 mil per week, edited... 
@_date: 2017-07-23 06:00:09
Usually you can still trade even if the wallet is disabled. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 19:23:26
Not to you maybe. I'm still laughing about his joke. 
I will try to only laugh about socially acceptable things in the future though. Do you have a list for me? Is it a blacklist or a whitelist?
@_date: 2017-07-18 04:04:07
If you want to play it safe buy 1000/2000 $ worth per week. 1 day candles still look like a total disaster, I'm not convinced yet that the dump is over. I'm dipping my toes back in myself, but only slowly. I´d rather miss out on a few percent growth than buying a dead cat bounce. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:36:20
@_date: 2017-07-03 19:01:38
To be fair, my joke was shitty, his was brilliant imo.

Please be true.

I'll tell you something funny. The funny thing is, you're probably still thinking I'm the sick one of us two.
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:50:34
Yeah and their faces in contrast to his smile. This will go viral af. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:54:29
I have a strong suspicion that it wasn't suicide. That would also answer your question. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:28:29
Did you try importing your key to the windows or Android app? I didn't even know that they have a chrome extension... 
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:54:26
@_date: 2017-07-26 10:27:10
Why wouldn't you simply buy a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-18 12:04:22
I hope you're just using trading terminology. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:30:52
Then you will be a hodler and shouldn't worry about the short term price movements. You asking what's happening indicates that this is not the case, so I was kind of joking that you may panic sell later.
  
And just to be clear: Selling isn't necessarily a bad thing. If falling prices make you panic, you might have invested too much and should not let hodl memes stop you from correcting that mistake.
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:36:01
I'd do it, but that would cut into my profits.

Happycoins is lightning fast for sepa. Their fees are a little higher than elsewhere but if I wire them the money before 18h I get my btc usually at 10h the next morning. Might depend on your bank though. In this market, having your btc 2 days earlier easily outweighs the difference in fees. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 11:18:10
When everybody is talking moonlambo-bullshit: sell
When everybody announces the end of crypto: buy
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:34:26
Yeah most alts are tanking too, it's definitely the eth effect... 
@_date: 2017-06-29 18:16:49
How could we have known! A well maintained app, completely free with no ads. I'm shocked!
@_date: 2017-06-30 08:52:09
Depends on what you get for it. I'd take 50% with free healthcare and education over the current US system any day. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 06:44:24
Yeah it's annoying but a good sign in general, lots of new people coming in. For every lazy one there's probably 5 that actually have enough brains to use the search function. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:43:05
No risk, no fun! 
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:00:41
Depends on if he kept them...

Only very few people with a lot of experience make more money trading than holding / dollar cost averaging.
