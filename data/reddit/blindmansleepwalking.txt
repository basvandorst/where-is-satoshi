@_date: 2013-11-29 12:45:32
 The government is a bunch of idiots that don't realize that Bitcoin is the future financial protocol for the internet. If You know about bitcoin You should buy every little piece You can get.NOW!
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:37:30

@_date: 2013-11-17 14:56:33
I sold all my silver on bitmit before it closed and could not be happier because I bought at $30 too. Silver has a future as an industrial metal, that's it.
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:21:59
If Your wallet is 124 weeks behind in synchronizing, You don't have a wallet Yet. If You want a wallet fast go to blockchain.info. If Your going to be a miner that is getting complicated.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:04:53
I stand corrected. WORD!
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:29:58

@_date: 2013-11-17 15:50:54
Learn a lesson. When transferring funds send all; down to the last micro BTC for this reason.
@_date: 2013-11-23 09:44:54
Your are downloading the transaction history of the network. It is useful to have a desktop wallet. But to operate quickly blockchain.info is one place to go and start operating quickly.
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:45:52
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:59:49
