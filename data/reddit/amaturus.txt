You brought up the comparison to physics. It's odd to accuse me of arguing there is a sterile laboratory. Policy actions can be effective in some circumstances and ineffective in others, and there's plenty of research in the area to uncover why. You're approaching this from a specific model that assumes government invention cannot be effective. I'm not assigning super powers to the government by insisting otherwise.

It isn't that the index will always but increase, rather that the likelihood of it going to zero is basically limited to apocalyptic situations while gambling always has a significant chance or losing everything. Bitcoin's possibility of being worthless is still a very real risk and that's what makes it a gamble.

You're ignoring all kinds of friction that can exist in a marketplace. Capital resources are scare and the committing those resources to a project with collective as opposed to individual gains is a difficult proposition. At the end of day, you're suggesting collective action anyway from the community and the reality is governments have significant economies of scale when it comes to collective action. That's why they tend to bear the burden of infrastructure investment.

Many economics oriented critics were focused on the deflationary aspects of bitcoin, but it's really the classic misalignment of incentives that threatens it here. If this does bring down bitcoin, the evolution of cyrptocurrency will continue, although adoption may be stunted.

Explain why most corporations don't keep a 1:1 ratio of current liabilities to cash. The fact that banks don't have a dollar in cash for every dollar in deposit liability is not an issue. Their maturity risk stems from the fact that their cash generating investments may not coincide with withdrawals from demand deposits. Non-bank companies can manage their current liabilities more actively but banks can be subject to sudden demands leading to bank runs if there's no interbank led it facility.

That's great for maintenance but the initial capital expenditure is usually too large to motivate private investors without the use of government funds or loan guarantees.

We don't have the numbers here. That 22% could represent a 35% capital gains tax divided into the proceeds. That's not to say there couldn't be another tax at play as well.

Be careful with the term investment. Picking one horse and sticking with it isn't a good investment style. If you think an industry will outperform a good strategy would be to diversify your holdings across it so your eggs are never always in one basket. If you think crypto currency is the future then you should invest in them by developing a portfolio. You can weight it by market share so that bitcoin is the largest investment, but it makes sense to hold others as well.

The bank examination job literally has nothing to do with the monetary policy function at the Fed. He was a basically regulatory auditor in a Fed district, far from the FOMC decisions in DC. Don't be so quick to disregard something just because it has the Fed attached to it.

This does literally nothing to reform the IRS. At the end of the day, you're the one responsible for proving that you've met tax obligations. If you try to inconvenience the IRS with the proof you provide, they can simply reject it. You aren't tying up resources. You're costing yourself money in penalties and interest.
@_date: 2014-06-23 18:36:39
The government probably doesn't define it as such. If you own bitcoin in a country that considers it an asset class, then it's your responsibility to be aware of any applicable taxes due.

Moral hazard is a prime topic for economics research. The suggestion that the existence of moral hazard should limit policy responses is not well-supported.

The analysis has some good points but it's off-base  in others. Bank cards with EC chips are preferred to credit cards in Germany. You may not be able to use it an a pub or corner bakery, but every grocery store will take an EC Karte. 
I think the hyperinflation bit is overblown as well. The young people in Berlin using bitcoin likely don't even remember a divided Germany. Their motivations have nothing to do with the Weimar Republic. That's really just someone with a vague understanding of their history trying to fit in a narrative. Overall, Berlin's acceptance of bitcoin comes down to demographics: young population, international, high degree of education but not a lot of industry to employ them. Berlin is chided as a hipster city by southern Germans because it's supported by their taxes. It is a really cool place though. I always recommend people visit Berlin or Munich (which is a common destination for those two week high school European tours).

That's not proof at all. It's proof of what I said: that banks, like other corporations, do not retain the entirety of their cash to cover current liabilities. On a bank's balance sheet, deposits represent a current liability. If banks held 100% reserves then they would have the cash on hand to cover all current liabilities. This is not expected of any other industry, why should it be of banks?

The way you've phrased it makes it seem like TARP created the systemic risk. The financial system was in wholesale collapse before TARP was ever implemented. The chain of systemic risks systems from the intersection of finance and insurance (such as CDOs) and the resulting fire sales to cover capital positions. This frozencredit markets for the broader economy as lines of credit offered to businesses were rescinded and cash flow risk was exacerbated.

No. The other currency just becomes a larger player in world trade. You can probably connect the figure to GDP and export/imports.

That's ex post facto reasoning. They depend on the infrastructure now but if they didn't have it, that doesn't mean they'd pay for it to be built. It's fairly clear that large capital outlays, like an interstate highway network are not likely to come from the private sector without government assistance. Rail ways, canals, bridges are all projects generally requiring government support. In your example even, it's not uncommon for cities to build support infrastructure to new shopping areas or business parks. It's often a part of an incentive package encouraging the building of the facilities in the first place.

We've haven't let a crisis just play out for the last 100 years. The public and businesses expects government to step in and ease suffering. Falsifying that expectation would have drastically changed the relationship between government and the country. It's only an ideological assertion that this would lead to a better outcome.

Banks don't make money on nothing. They take on maturity risk by turning short-term deposits into long-term loans. This utility makes them a necessary part of the market.

A dollar could buy 58 Icelandic krona in November 2007. Today a dollar can buy 114. The Icelandic response was massive currency devaluation, which is exactly the kind of thing bitcoin is meant to resist.

That's not a very good reason to believe in the future of bitcoin. Parties will always have a vested interest in verifying that money isn't being laundered. Banks and the like would be liable if they didn't. Instant transfers sound great but not at the cost of destroying your business.

'Real world' investing isn't geared towards individual investors, rather institutions that can create economies of scale. The comparison to bitcoin ignores the reality that securities markets are much more efficient overall than the bitcoin market. Individuals are much better off sitting on a low expense ratio index fund through an owned-by-clients firm like Vanguard.

This is a really weak graph. According to IMF data, there is close to $12 trillion in total global foreign exchange reserves. Only about $4 trillion of that is in USD and its percentage of the total has been declining since at least the early 2000s. The euro makes up $1.75 trillion.

Bitcoin will ultimately always be translated to USD by these businesses to satisfy tax obligations, so there is disincentives to use it if it's so volatile.

Saving can still mean hoarding if it isn't deferred consumption. If you break into economic models, saving is only beneficial if it leads to consumption in the future, which is what is often assumed.

You're true in terms of psychology, but the root problem with bitcoin is its lack of fundamental valuation. Stocks and bonds are claims on assets and income streams of their issuers. Even fiat currency can be said to have value in its ability to relieve tax obligations. What is bitcoin besides what its buyers imagine it to be?

Speculative investing of any sort is not a way to build wealth. Thinking that bitcoin is different from past kinds of speculation is exactly the fallacy past investors have fallen into.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:18:54
The only fundamental valuation of bitcoin that makes sense is the marginal energy cost it takes to mine a block. The number of users is no indication of value because there is no underlying reason to hold or accept bitcoin. Fiat currencies have an underlying demand because they can be used to relieve tax obligations to the issuing authority.
