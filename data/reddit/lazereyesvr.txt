you are 100% right and that makes the number of upvotes this has even more depressing

Holy shit are they hateful. Makes me kind of sad to see what the bitcoin community has come down to. There's more mouth foaming and toxicity than in practically anything else.

You've no idea what's going on, you see an asset jump 20% in a day, you don't understand the dynamics or the market or the tech, you bought in and are currently losing. Yet you feel like you have to buy more. And most of the subreddit will encourage you, HODL and what not. 
Look, I get you guys are all passionate about bitcoin and all that, but this post is the textbook example of financial irresponsibility. 
My advice, which you probably won't follow? Stop buying, stop doing anything. Read up, learn and follow the market a few weeks/months. If you are in this for a get-rick-quick scheme instead of a technological innovation, at least do it right.

When I say banks I mean Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley. Those guys look for markets and crypto is a market now.

They don't give 0 fucks. They are all actually at least watching and normally entering the space. There's a bit of buzzword speak, but "banks give zero fucks" is a meme, banks are starved for innovation competing with fintech and blockchain is an important part of that.

Gambling is illegal in Japan. Japanese people have a lot of savings. Interest rates and "riskless" financial products yield ~0%. Therefore everyone is looking for ways to make the Japanese people fork their cash and the Japanese people looking for ways to get some return on their money. Traditionally banks and brokers have been successful with foreign exchange and unsuccessful with stocks so I guess bitcoin was a no brainer to try.

Reading posts like this and their answers can't help thinking when bitcoin inevitably corrects and a bunch of fools panic sell it's going to be the sticky suicide hotline post all over again. All while whales and traders out there that are manipulating the market left and right and milking these fools are laughing all the way to the bank.

Have you been in a pachinko? it's "gambling" for losers. There's no casinos or online betting or stuff like that. If you are a respectable "watanabe san" you don't go to a pachinko, you "invest" in currency.

There are but compared to other nations, the Japanese invest massively in FX and very little in stocks. Most of the products a retail bank will sell you are a form of FX betting.

Sure, some Japanese people go to Macau. Most don’t. Most Japanese never leave Japan (it’s surprising but it’s easy to find 60 year old people who’ve never been in a plane). Most don’t speak languages. Most don’t even like foreign “things”. 
What I’m talking about is not that is physically impossible for a Japanese person to gamble. It’s that the law has relegated gambling to a marginal and frowned upon activity, like pachinkos. In other countries there’s a culture of sports and online betting, many lotteries, casinos, arcades, etc. In Japan for the most part there isn’t.

Very true. Still it’s a bit painful to see people with savings gambling in New Zealand dollars and not investing in in US stock index funds because it’s “risky”. But you are right, psychology is a big factor.

By the way HK and Macau are at least 7 hours away if you count time lost in the airport (flight is 5 hours)

Assuming it's true, this is the important data point.

Every single thing you said there is wrong. Every 5 words there’s a mistake. It’s impressive. Japan’s unemployment is like 2.5%. Steadily going down since bitcoin was invented (it was 5% then, not exactly tragic).

Carry trade moved billions of dollars in, for example. USDJPY before the crisis. It's basically interest rate arbitrage. It's a pretty standard trading technique. Of course with a standard currency is less risky because they don't have the extreme volatility and risk of bitcoin (still in the crisis a lot of people lost money). There were even ways to get a lower interest rate on a mortgage deal getting your mortgage in JPY.
