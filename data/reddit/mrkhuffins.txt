So let me get this straight. 
Monero : You see all the negative points and there are many you numbered. You support this coin and have invested money
XC : You see the negative points , mainly the fact its closed source. Yet you aggressively and over emotionally attack anything or anyone who mentions or talks about it. 
Yep this isn't just some stupid emo kid crying because he got scammed

you are trying to "refute" a claim made by a closed source cryptosystem....... you should get on with that eyeball scraping

Yes and while i can agree that unless open sourced or verified independently by several crypto and security experts that those claims can not be proven. 
Claiming a sybil attack is a simple way to attain information also cannot be proven unless its open sourced, or you try to act as a malicious node and get the information

Very true but try not to relate this post directly to the developers, it looks as thou it was something that was an idea of someone who follows the coin, The recent protests in hong kong are using mesh networks, a new anonymity feature was released a few weeks ago for the coin that involved ad hoc mesh networks. 
The funny thing is someone was complaining in the post previously about lack of advertising and people mentioned that it is not the time to advertise yet, not until they have released the other features and plans and are open source.

Because a valid counter point was brought up and you have no arguement to counteract it, except state the account is new.
