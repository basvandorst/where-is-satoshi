No different from moving money from cold storage into your hot wallet really. One transaction from cold to hot wallet, and one to open the channel, then as many transactions as you can do until the money runs out. I have already saved hundreds of transactions fees by using lightning network. The technology is ready right now for the brave. Today. In time it will be as easy as just using a normal wallet and you won't even realize or care about it. But I'm sure you'll find something else to complain about.
You can try your best with the misinformation, but the truth will prevail.

No, the fees will drop as LN adoption increases. And LN is part of the solution, nobody is saying it's a complete solution forever and ever. Anyone saying that is lying.
I don't recall anyone saying we'd never transact on-chain again. On-chain will still be part of the solution and LN will continue to make it cheaper to use.
If you want to go ahead along the 56k modem route, be my guest. I'll continue to use LN like I do today, without any drama or bullshit. For me, it just works and it's saved a lot on fees and waiting.

If you don't want to use a third party service then just use a wallet which supports channel rebalancing.
So you open channel  and move funds to channel

I am aware of the major bug in 2010. It broke consensus. As I said in my post/rant I would be okay with that. Just. I believe this should only happen when the base protocol is critically broken to the point where the consensus rules that everyone agreed to are broken.
Unless I'm massively misunderstanding the situation, which is possible of course, Ethereum didn't break. A badly written smart contract was hacked. No different to a hot wallet being hacked or exchange losing money. The entire coin should never hard fork for that. But it did. It's against my ethics so I walked away. 
The money is either sound or it isn't. You either have reversible transactions or you don't. My messages to my friend are encrypted or they are not. You shouldn't make exceptions because of a flaw in a smart contract due to inadequate programming.
I remember a major argument at the time being "well, I lost a bit of money in a crap contract I wrote and I can't get it back. Can we hard fork for that as well?". The answer was no. That person was being flippant of course, but the answer would always be no because that person wasn't important enough. All crypto users on ETH are equal, but some are more equal than others.


Good. As did I. I voted with my wallet and sold all my ETH soon after as apparently my voice wasn't loud enough (I regularly change reddit account in case you were wondering). As far as I'm concerned that one action alone was enough to relegate it to shitcoin status. Which is genuinely a shame, it's interesting technology and I was excited to own both bitcoin and Ethereum. Now there's no point in owning Ethereum.


Nope. It happened once. Once too many. It can or will happen again. Andreas even warned about it here:  In my view he's spot on with the exception that I feel it's already too late. It's already happened. The line between "can't" and "won't" has already been crossed and the rest of the conversation should just be "pack it up boys, we're done here". I respect Andreas immensely, even if I disagree with him sometimes.


People can hold whatever conferences they like. There is no "offical bitcoin conference". I'm sure if the ETH price moons (again) you'll see morons doing the same for ETH as well. And yes, I agree with the point you're making but it's misplaced in this argument. There are idiots in BTC as well, of course, but at least the protocol treats them all equally.

Most wallets require some level of third party services to get the job done. Even ones where you control the keys. Even my precious electrum.

Doesn't matter if the seed is compromised. Any software could have been used.
Also ledger can be used to send to bc1 if you use Electrum.
@_date: 2019-06-02 09:24:26


Not the person you are asking, but:
* It's a premined coin
* The ledger is not immutable
The first I can **just** about forgive purely on the basis that the coin was actually genuinely trying to do something new and it sort of made sense to do this at the time. The second I cannot.
Imagine if bitcoin had reversed transactions due to the recent Binance hack. [This is something they wanted to do]( and the situation is very similar to the DAO attack on ETH.
One big entity/contract "lost" a lot of money, so the network agrees to reverse the transactions. Unthinkable on bitcoin, and I thought unthinkable on Ethereum until it happened.
If it was a hack in the base protocol itself, where maybe literally everyone's coins were moved to one address or something or some other consensus rule was horribly broken, then sure, I wouldn't like it but I could understand it and get behind it.
But some losing money due to faulty implementation in their security or "smart contract"? No, fuck right off with that. We all play by the same rules and just because you lost a lot of money playing with fire doesn't mean it's okay for the entire network to hardfork. If I lost $1,000 (maybe a lot of money to me?) on some shitty badly written contract nobody would've cared. But because rich/"important" people lost the money we move heaven and Earth to fix it. May as well just use fiat at that point as we're basically playing by those rules instead of the supposed "code is law" bullshit that was once a motto. "Code is law, until it doesn't suite us" is more accurate.
And now it's happened once, it'll happen again. Maybe some government gets annoyed I sent some money to a charity in Venezuela, may I attend the wrong protest, maybe I troll some politician a little too hard. A word in the ear of the right people, a bit of pressure here or there. Boom, transaction reversed with another hardfork "security upgrade". After all, they did it once, why can't they do it now? We now know they're not unable, just unwilling, to save my $1,000. At some point in the future I could even see lawsuits demanding hardforks for future losses. Likely? maybe not. Try and sue "Bitcoin" and see what happens...
Where is the threshold for the next hard fork? $1m? $10m? $100m? Who has to lose it? Nobody's like me that get ignored? Rich programmers? Vitalik himself? What's the combination? I don't see a consensus rule for that, just the whims of developers who are happy to throw their morals out the window when it becomes expensive.
I sold all my ETH shortly after the hard fork. I kept ETC around for a while but then sold that too as the network is too insecure. A year later ETC had a 51% attack, so that was a good call apparently.
People never think about these things. It's all memes, egos, price, moons, lambos and "hey, I can send for under 1 cent in 8 seconds! never mind I don't have a chance of running a node".
If the security is weak then the coin is worthless. It's a shame, ETH had potential.

@_date: 2019-06-01 13:50:55
Oh you ❤️
Blocks only does exactly that: just the blocks. No transactions outside of the blocks.
This means if you actually try to use your node to transact, anyone who may be connected to your node will just see it send out a transaction every time **you** actually transact, not just passing on other people's transactions to add to the mempool. This will make it super obvious to connected nodes that any transactions it sees from your nodes are specifically for you. Hence the privacy issues. A VPN could indeed help here.
Another downside is as your node doesn't have anything in the mempool, it has no idea what the fees should be. So you'll have to do your own homework when transacting and setting the fees.
If you plan on just setting up the node and forgetting about it then I guess it matters less. I personally run my own node with electrumx so I can transact using electrum and my own node. It was a bit of a pig to set up but it's how I prefer to do things. The bandwidth is a bit of a drain but it's worth it. Obviously blocksonly wouldn't be ideal for me.
@_date: 2019-06-02 05:00:26

99.999% chance: Your recovery seed was compromised because you had poor opsec and you did something stupid with it like stored it on your computer or online somewhere. You also shared your public key here which has just completely trashed your privacy. Good work. I would offer you a stiff drink but I know it gives you headaches.
0.001% chance: there is a defect in the ledger wallet/software which leaked the master seed.
I'm going with the most likely option.
@_date: 2019-04-29 06:30:22


And how do you think they recoup that money?
@_date: 2019-05-31 07:27:44


The disinformation is strong here.
No such thing as a "hub node". Connect to whomever you damn well please. Some wallets do this automatically for you already. If you spend a lot of money at, say, joltfun.com, then by all means connect to his node directly if you're going to be shopping there all the time, that just makes sense. But it really doesn't matter that much. Just means your fees will go from 0 to 0.01 cents (that's 0.01 of a cent, not 1 cent), which isn't a big deal for most people. Some nodes route for free, and the ones that charge for routing are "unfairly cheap".


This is different from your previous assertion. You've gone from "You have to commit all the money you might possibly want to spend on a channel upfront." to this. These are two different statements.
Yes, you have to commit funds. Yes, that's a "sticking point" right now. No, it won't be a sticking point forever; wallets will abstract this all away over time and nobody will care too much. I don't manually craft bitcoin transactions; my wallet does that for me. In time it will be the same with lightning. The wallet will just understand that opening a lightning channel is probably a good idea for whatever transaction it needs to complete and it'll do the work for you.
Say you commit $100, you spend $50 over 5 purchases, but want to make a $80 purchase. You can top up the needed $30 easily enough. Buy more through an exchange and withdraw to lightning as you would if you ran out of regular bitcoin, or using a service which does btc -&gt; lightning conversions for you. Even if you outright close the $50 channel and open a new $100 channel, you've still reduced the amount of on-chain fees you've paid significantly as it's 3 on-chain transactions (open channel, close channel, open channel again) instead of 6.
Lightning network is still new, it's still not perfect, just like on-chain bitcoin. But please don't spread misinformation if you don't even understand the fundamentals or have not even tried to use the technology, which is the case here.
You're like a horse salesman saying the car will become popular off because it's "too fast". Early cars were shit, this isn't news, but look at where we are now with them. We are in the "shit car" phase, but we're absolutely in the "we have cars now" phase and the future of this technology is very exciting.
Try it out. Grab a wallet (Eclair is a fine choice on mobile) and spend some money at bitrefill or joltfun or whatever. Once you've spent some money (and therefore have incoming capacity) send me a 20cent invoice and I'll pay it. Seriously. Just make sure you've turned on the incoming option on Eclair, as I think that's off by default. Could be a fun weekend project.
