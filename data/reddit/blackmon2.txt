Crap like the bitlicence is happening because bitcoin isn't scaling fast enough.  Bitcoin needs to get big before more governments decide to kill the baby in the womb.

@_date: 2015-06-20 14:15:38
The other core devs (is it really 2 dozen?) want glory for their work on side-projects that take transactions 'off' the bitcoin network.  They want the block limit low for that, so that the bitcoin network feels the pain.
@_date: 2015-06-06 12:00:03
Let's just hurry up and raise the limit to some more sensible number.

You should never have been depending on this temporary 1MB limit, that was sneaked into the code without peer review, being permanent.  
It was even stated at the time, by the submitter, that it was temporary!  Go and use an altcoin if you want 1MB blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:33:49
Not really.  It can be relatively simple:  and SPV clients could continue working without change.
Last thing we need is to be introducing a whole new form of complexity with potential for a whole new world of bugs just to placate a few stick-in-the-muds with conflicts of interest who are stalling bitcoin until we let them have what they want.
@_date: 2015-06-04 23:19:04
What makes you think that blocks would increase in size?  We're talking about a blocksize LIMIT.  They should only increase in size if people are using that extra space.
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:46:40
It's not a 'hack'.  Increasing the limit at a certain blocksize would be the canonical way to do it.
@_date: 2014-12-14 12:47:33
Better to have control of the network in the hands of the coin holders perhaps.  @_date: 2015-05-30 17:25:36

It's just like an Internet startup company, like Amazon back in the day.  They wait until their websites and infrastructure are absolutely at breaking limits before adding a tiny bit more capacity.
Oh wait, no, they don't do that at all because then they'd be overtaken by competitors.

In English, the comma is used to separate thousands.  The point (.) is used to begin decimals.

As you may already have realised, coffee purchases need to be on the blockchain in some form, so that people who accept payment from the coffee buyer or coffee seller know whether or not those people still have that money.
As for Lightning, few people would be against that, but I wouldn't want to cripple onchain capacity for it right now.  Lightning still requires blockchain transactions to open and settle anyway.  So we've gone from one blockchain transaction for my coffee to two.  It'd take fewer transactions overall if everyone joined Lightning and just did most transactions through that, but then you're not using the blockchain for security anymore.
Let's see how Lightning goes before we cripple onchain scaling for it.

Very misleading article; sad that you're continuing to share it.  What's happening with bitcoin is not some kind of accident or misunderstanding -- A private company is seizing control of bitcoin to push people to their private solutions.  That's it.

Who, Core?
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:22:15
So you see, there's the problem people have with Core's SegWit.  You want to see how it goes for 18 months before you start with the 18-month process of a capacity increase to non-witness space.  That means that a non-witness capacity increase is 3 years away.  But this is something that the leading Core devs promised the miners that they would have coded up and promoted already, so the miners are angry that this non-witness capacity increase HF isn't already in wallets.

It's not about "egos".  A private company has successfully taken over Bitcoin development and fooled the small cartel of Chinese mining companies into going along with it, in order to push transactions onto their own side networks.
@_date: 2017-05-31 04:56:56
It's not 2MB.  It's 1MB of non-witness data with up to 3MB of witness data on top of that.  That's OK for using the blockchain as a tool for setting up or adding to side channels or 2nd layer networks, but not so good for normal transactions.
Large fees for transactions with significant witness discount would lead to everyone just 'choosing' to use one or two Lightning Networks rather than transact on-chain.  And what do you think BlockStream's business model is?
The miners were probably hoping for the 2MB non-witness data with Segwit atop that as per the HK Agreement.
@_date: 2017-05-22 04:31:40
HK Agreement was 2MB base with witness data on top of that.
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:10:19
It wasn't tied to a non-witness blocksize increase hard fork.
In place of that tying in code, there was the HK Agreement.  Adam Back changed his signature on that, miners signalled for Classic in retaliation (not enough to activate it) and eventually Segwit was released in a different form to what the miners signed up to.
@_date: 2017-05-22 03:54:58
Well Core have been planning a hard fork for over a year, ever since the HK Agreement!   Right?  Right?
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:05:04
So why is SegWit in the code right now and a safe hard fork blocksize increase with everyone having a year or two to upgrade isn't?
@_date: 2015-10-28 15:36:58
7 tps is the maximum if transactions are really small (in bytes).  More realistic to say 2-3tps.
@_date: 2017-05-31 07:42:07
Why not honour the HK Agreement?
@_date: 2017-05-31 07:38:29
That's a long time to wait for SegWit!


@_date: 2017-05-18 09:58:36

Don't blame him; He and the other miners already agreed to activate SegWit.  
@_date: 2016-10-20 19:12:18
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:56:28
Miners agreed with Core to activate SegWit over a year ago, in the Hong Kong Agreement.  The agreement was broken, and not by the miners.
EDIT. Apparently F2Pool broke the agreement.
EDIT 2. apparently in retaliation for Adam Back retroactively changing his signature?
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:46:00
No, the miners agreed to a compromise solution, last year.  Minimal scaling, but with significant witness space.
BlockStream decided not to give them that and give even more minimal scaling with proportionally even more witness space, so miners got pissed.
2MB, 4MB, 8MB... all are far below Bitcoin's original 32MB implicit limit.
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:01:02


@_date: 2017-05-25 01:40:04
That's why it's an emergency -- Core was holding out on us so miners would activate SegWit with massive witness discount and no other scaling.
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:42:49
Because now it may be too late for wishlist items.
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:12:33

And to make sure that the first layer is not starved of revenue.  Why should BlockStream get all the money?
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:34:09
Layer 2 transactions are great; that's why miners agreed for there to be a massive 2MB space for witness data which would be in excess of what 2MB of normal chain transactions would need.
Miners just aren't willing to end the possibility for on-blockchain transacting yet.
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:24:16
HK Agreement was 2MB non-witness data not 1MB non-witness data.
Proportionally more witness data disincentivises normal one-to-one transactions and favours more complex transactions, such as might be used to open many addresses onto a 2nd layer channel.  And if it costs too much to use the chain, then everyone would just join the same Lightning Network (run by BlockStream?) through a one-time blockchain fee.
Jihan would want normal blockchain transactions to continue to be feasible for the near future without killing the exciting possibilities that 2nd layer can provide.
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:32:07

What a disingenuous comment.  Miners didn't activate  Classic or other stuff around that time because Core got scared of losing control and decided to promise the miners (what we now call) Segwit2x instead.
Segwit2x is what the miners have activated recently and the Aug 1st activation of the Segwit part is just something they were able to do to keep more people happy and together.

I guess he also wants to raise the target block time to 5 days so that even people who receive blocks by snail mail have a fair chance to mine a block.
