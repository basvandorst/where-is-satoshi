I send letters to LLCs all the time. Usually it's sent via US mail and by email to whomever I believe may be able to address its contents. Honestly, your best three options are (1) hire a lawyer, (2) give them a call (so they're forced to speak with you) and have them email you the exact reason why your account was disabled so you can address it later, or (3) get lucky with having your story go viral and have them reply to you via social media for easy PR points. Hope that helps in some way!

1. I wasn't trying to impress. I was simply showing they have an address to receive mail.
2. It may be a satalite office where mail is scanned or forwarded. Neither of us know. It's really not that important.

That is some serious broken English. What the Hell are you trying to say?

Seriously. This is the first thing to do. I am a lawyer and I've sent letters to banks and brokers that ended up scaring the other side into doing my client's wishes. A lawyer (depending on the firm) may charge you anywhere from $100 to $600 for such a letter, which is nothing compared to your frozen assets. Best of luck my friend!

Your comment makes no sense. I have no idea what you're trying to say.
