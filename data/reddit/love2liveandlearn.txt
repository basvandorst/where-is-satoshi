I know you're just kidding. My feeling is that it won't replace fiat in our life times (after that we're all dead),  but rather it's another asset class alongside with gold, property, stock, etc.

This chart is at least one year old. Let's do a quick back-of-the-envelop calculation for **today**.
I believe this is how the chart gets its value,
Total BTC in circulation = $13.145 mil approx (increases with each passing minute)
Price = $500  (approx at recent price)
Total BTC value = 13.145 mil x 500 = $6.573 bil  approx
Total U.S. currency  in circulation = $1290 bil  (as of 2 July)
according to 
BTC to U.S. currency in circulation ratio = 6.573 / 1290 = 0.0051 = 0.51%
Of course, this is U.S. currency in circulation. Most of the money supply isn't in circulation, and even more "money" are in credit. So the actual ratio is much much smaller.

Should tip over the tables like a certain Jew did inside a temple complex in Jerusalem some 2000+ years ago...

You learnt computing on Commodore 64?
I learnt Basic on Commodore 64 when I was in my early 20s and I'm 10 years older than you. I'm impressed.

Interesting price modelling. Any model is better than no model, even if it's a linear model.
I wonder how a variable that account for competitive crypto-currencies would fit into this model?

Also, we shouldn't only compare the ratio with U.S. currency. The whole crux of BTC is that is global, non sovereign currency. Its holders spread to all countries.
So if we going to compare, we should look at the ratio of BTC to ALL currencies. At the very least, the sum of USD, RMB, EURO, and JPY as an approx of total global currencies.
This makes the ratio even more minicule. But this is good. The lower the ratio, it suggests the more Bitcoin is undervalued, or that its potential is astronomical.
