Your first assumption is wrong $1invested bitcoin in 2009 is 3k - 4k USD now and the $1 invested bitcoin can be much much more in future hence yes it has value... And also volatile. Problem is while all cryptocurrency are pegged against bitcoin still bitcoin is pegged against USD. Bitcoin can only be stable when currencies, services and businesses peg their value against bitcoin

Well in answering you I was trying to make the point that what ever we are trying to do with altcoins can still be done with bitcoin and or at least bitcoin should become the universal currency

Well I do not have to spread rumors nor you have to believe me I just told what I knew

Well all good points only one thing is from what I hear is coz there is lot at stake if they close immediately... And just to let you know from the exchanges that I hear is that pboc officials and police literally have a separate room in the office of exchanges and are making sure the winding down and each of the investor money is refunded... Yes the trading is happening but after talking to some of the key contracts there I have come to the conclusion what they say is.a facade coz even they do not know what government is gonna do next. And please mark my words the OK coin and the ico are just ruse to crack at greater cryptocurrency ecosystem and what chinese are doing is what they are best at... Finding a loophole to bypass it... So yeah that is why o feel the news is dated...
