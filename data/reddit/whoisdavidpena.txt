I'm going with Late end of early adoption.

You have to move your crypto from your wallet to the vault. I don't think you can do it within the app; you can do the move on desktop.

Right?!? Haha just goes to show some skepticism can be beneficial.

I would recommend freezing your TREZOR in a bowl of water. That way it can be a huge block of ice. If there is any heat ups, it'll melt the ice instead of touch your TREZOR.

Sheldon is Satoshi confirmed

Why not both?

I think so many people are ready for a dip that it might not be that massive. Who knows though.

Personally try to take it out yourself and see. Not only do you need more than one authorization, but you also have to wait 2 days I think. It's not the safest option out there, but it's safer than using your wallet.

High fees is relative. It cost me about 2 bucks the first time. It'll be cheaper to buy off an exchange like Gemini or GDAX tho
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:49:49
Same happened to me. I just used another exchange (Gemini) instead.
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:18:24
Very few people are going to put the max in at first I think.

I've taken dumps longer than that initial dip! It climbed up a bit, but who knows how long the volatility related to the Tether hack will continue.
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:48:46
I think people need to spend bitcoin in order for organic growth to continue. I do think it's important to buy however much bitcoin you spend though.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:24:24
Crypto can be pretty volatile though. I guess it's better than whatever Venezuela uses.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:04:50
Ah ok! Yeah I had seen Tether be brought up this past week. I didn't expect something to happen that quick. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:01:09
Timing with what?

Dang! And I was getting ready to buy a juicy dip lol
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:10:35
Awesome! I guess I'm just only seeing one side of the whole thing right now. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:00:36
Haha whoa that's crazy. Big dip if true. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:55:40
Do you think that will make BTC less of a day to day currency though? If that's the case, then what's the point? I'll look into any HODL post though. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:34:22
Only second to, "what if I had bought xxxx amount of bitcoin back in 2009 right? At least for me it is lol
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:36:00
Major props to people like you! 
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:36:19
And thank you for posting this too! I'm very new to this whole thing, and was wondering the same thing.
