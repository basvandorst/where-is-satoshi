It's GBTC 2.0
Then there will be another ETF &amp; then....well you get the point. 
Not enough BTC held &amp; it lessens demand for BTC among investor holders due to how easy it is to get via brokerage.  You'll have the same back &amp; forth GLD gold types have with the "Physical" gold &amp; silver stackers.  If this ETF becomes real earliest probably autumn....GBTC &amp; WinkleTF ( how bitchin a name would thata been lol) will both be 70-100% of BTC Coinbase price.

Seriously &amp; now the Halving is gone to them.  They'll be lucky to to get in in 2016.  
I wanted to give Gemini a try but idk.  Disappointing.

For example - use Elkhorn S&amp;P GSCI Dynamic Roll Commodity ETF.  Inception date May 24 2016.
BATS GLOBAL Press Release:
However - If you look on SEC site for BATS ( you have to scroll the releases go to PDF) You will see a trail asking SEC for approval to list months before.  At minimum - if it gets approved we have 4 months.
So no Halvening run-up or immediate after-glow.  :-(

Always good to use stops but you really won't need.  This thing still isn't approved they've updated it to reflect current upswing from original file price &amp; they are moving from NASDAQ to BATS.  Noticed that the ringer lady they had that got GLD thru the approval hoops is gone now which is disconcerting.  When approved ( or if I suppose) there will be a date it goes live etc. probably 90 days.  Bummed this thing continues to languish.  Winklevoss guys have twin black clouds lol.

This is just Winklevoss switching from Nasdaq - BATS &amp; updating that S-1.
BATS hasn't petitioned SEC with notice to trade said ETF.
How can you tell?  
Look at SEC filings for BATS.  It shows the ETFs they have petitioned SEC for then subsequently brought on.  
Earliest this could happen IMO is October 1st.  Earliest as no BATS correspondence listed.

They missed the Halvening - if they get approved.
My bet is that it gets delayed further.  Their track record shows they could screw up a cup of coffee.
I don't think this is a good thing for BTC.  They don't have much BTC &amp; that will get bid up same a GBTC so now both funds will front run BTC by 2x.
These funds are difference between buying GLD &amp; owning physical.
I think they make it easier to NOT buy BTC &amp; that sucks.

Probably.  But I took notice when he kept harping on how fast $500 would be sliced thru &amp; 650 would be the waiting room for pop to $1000.  
He was going on about that scenario in the winter.  I had a "no way" moment when we went thru $700 recently but CH was like nope not till post 12th.  He sees BTC future as a settlement vehicle.

I think that those types are very vocal.  I think the reason that price will go up dramatically is that there is a growing number of well monied-strong hands that recognize BTC limited number as being more valuable than the upside for PMs &amp; fiat.  
If ya got burned in this BTC looks awfully nice:
They will purchase and hold long term.  Especially if heliocopter money gets going in Japan &amp; or the Euro tanks.

They will if this goes down:

Hmmm.  Go earlier if you want to see his BTC picks.  Back to last fall he was very specific calling timing of $4s &amp; then $6s (with added hardly any time being spent in 5s).
With BTC he is uncanny.  Other stuff?  Idk.  He has been calling huge numbers in PMs for years so I'm cool with him up to 1K on BTC but 14/10 etc?  
Also you're spot on for your technical analysis calls - everyone would be calling those guys flakes too but they show up in suits on tv lol.

Here's CH calling in April:
