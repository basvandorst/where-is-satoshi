The spread is about 4%. Still way cheaper than going through Coinbase as I get charged twice, once for gbp to euro then Coinbase fee and they have a spread as well. The main difference is you can’t send crypto outside of the Revolut app, it’s great for people who want a bit of exposure to crypto though. Super simple.

Going back to a Gold standard?

Are you a central banker?

Its great that its recovered so quickly but does anyone else feel like we are due a more 'organic' correction? i.e a healthy one not the orchestrated b*llshit we went through the other day?
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:24:19
Thats true but hopefully after a few years of transitioning no one will care about fiat currency anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:25:38
And back into no.3 spot.

Great post, i hope you'r right, long live BTC, we need it to add confidence and stability to the whole system.

Suppose it depends what you mean by a long time but id say by the end of this decade most fiat currencies will only be used as arse wipes.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:24:57
Now thats a BCH dump - 40% on the hour!

In Zimbabwe i think they ended up with 500 trillion dollar notes before they started wiping their arses with them.

Houses wouldnt cost what they do if it wasnt for the inflationary fiat currencies turning houses into debt based financial instruments, bck in the 70s a house was about 3 x annual earnings now its more like 10-12. Thats inflation, deflationary currencies dont do that.

It will start to gather pace soon, probably next year, we'll either get a big deflation followed by hyper inflation or a longer spell of increasing inflation, that's when the mass exodus from fiat currencies will start and people will want cryptos instead. Note - every single fiat currency in history has suffered this kind of death, i doubt this time will be different.

But why is BCH surging? Feels like its sucking the life out of everything else at the moment, feels very strange, theres been no major FUD to cause a sell off like this.
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:41:50
Yes we need all need to support BTC, it underpins the whole system, if any sort of flippening occurs and BCH takes over say goodbye to cryptos, mass adoption will never occur.

They wont be when you need a wheel barrow full to pay for a beer.

Strange i bought some y'day at Coinbase, it was in my account within a couple minutes, not sure whats changed so drastically in 24 hrs?
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:03:17
Yes sound money must first prove that it is a store of value, that is Bitcoins primary role!
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:29:17
And why is BTG dumping hard too? Some seriously weird goings on, make a good horror story this one day.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:22:27
Bitcoin buy? If that’s the search no one will be searching that during a big correction
