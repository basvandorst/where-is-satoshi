the classic situation, so heartbreaking when BTC was trading at $2,000 and my smart ass was day trading until I sold high, and I waited endlessly for the price to come back down lmao then bought in later at 3k

Hey man congratulations! I'm in the same boat as you, I'm at university full time but I work on Saturdays and I'm still putting money into my portfolio once a month.

Of course man! I told him, in less than 5 years that Amazon will start to accept Bitcoin or other forms of digital currency, and when it does I'll send him an email :)

That's a really good point, I'll include that for next time.

This. I work at a bank, so you can imagine the conversations and debates I've had with loan officers and financial advisors.

I work for a bank in Canada, basically what happens if you mention Bitcoin depends on who you're dealing with and what your account history is like. Personally, I would not recommend telling the bank that you are about to invest in Bitcoin or any cyrptocurrency (just show them the fat wire transfer that comes in for 22mil after a couple years hahah!). Many people still don't understand it, so they almost view it as a bad thing therefore persuading themselves to raise suspicion. If it's some old stubborn employee then he would probably flag your account, but if it's a younger employee and you have a good account history they wouldn't really care.
 I have seen both situations happen in the bank and I've also discussed this with my coworker as well. Lying is your best bet, just make it reasonable.
