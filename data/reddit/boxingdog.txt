time to move my btc to a segwit address
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:39:04
7% increase from yesterday is boring to you?
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:53:39
it is not zero fees as far I understand, LN needs to open and close a channel and that's it at least 2 transactions on the main chain.

A piece of currency


Money or other items used to facilitate transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:12:29
btc will be on sale on Thursday and when they announce just more regulations the price will boom again.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:28:55
Im not sure but maybe you can try importing your bch private key into another btc wallet
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:32:32
I do, I buy bitcoin and send it overseas to my ex wife where she converts them to the local currency. It's much cheaper and faster than a  wire transfer.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:14:37
That's awesome, I will recommend you to hire someone and do some extensive research before giving money to some charities, some of them could misuse the funds
@_date: 2014-02-12 03:05:49
try this 
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:47:16
or mark's alterego

@_date: 2014-02-28 14:38:31
that's what happens when a company is run by a moron.
@_date: 2014-07-07 17:29:05
this is useless without a secure printer
@_date: 2014-01-24 15:34:10

@_date: 2014-03-03 21:56:52
yumi spaghetti
@_date: 2014-07-18 18:25:00
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:13:22
wait... do we have to update our bitcoin address to use segwit?
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:47:56
get a pick and start minning it op
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:32:44
I think that has happened quite a lot actually, at 30, 300, 1000, 2500 ?
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:29:50
3.46 usd is still too high for a transfer, it should be 0.01 or less imo
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:33:46
what a fucking mess
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:21:22
10k per bitcoin in december, Im calling it
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:50:53
Only applies to keys generated with enough entropy
@_date: 2017-09-07 02:31:44
What I did is I printed two paper wallets, one for me and the other I gave it to my mom and I explained her how to take out the money if I die.
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:04:44
look at WeChat in china, almost everyone uses it for payments.
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:44:48
bye and welcome back tomorrow!
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:28:04
please dont do this and if you do then don't go public saying you have a lot of bitcoins
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:13:01
Banks are a fraud
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:33:28
aaaand btc is crashing hard today
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:42:20
yisus christ, even a startup is more stable than bitcoin at this point
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:44:58
can someone explain me why is crashing now? one day is going straight to the moon and the next is diving headfirst to the fucking core
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:57:02
whoever  sold his coins for 125, thank you.
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:19:08
then charge $5-10 to open an account.
@_date: 2013-04-18 06:35:58
@_date: 2013-04-28 04:55:07
It does not make sense... why dont mine btc for you?
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:58:17
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:39:49
@_date: 2013-04-04 06:32:11
TIL: sell when high, buy when mt gox is down
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:55:27
I don't know if I want to laugh or cry
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:35:32
brb.. travel in time to kick myself in the balls.
@_date: 2013-04-28 05:06:41
they just need to shutdown the exchanges, legal or by illegal means.
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:08:48
too late
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:53:12
now try to buy bitcoins in ghana...
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:26:38
now they're upgrading their database in the middle of ddoos attack....
@_date: 2013-04-28 05:12:36
yeah and also they can seize and null route all the pools
@_date: 2013-04-24 04:39:20
do you math, 2^256 * 2^256, these are the number of attempts to get the pk.
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:35:12
ok guys.. wtf happened?
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:31:43
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:23:37
if you can remember your private key that is something like your btc address, then yes.
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:01:16
probably part of the btc were moved to cold storage
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:41:40
people can't buy drugs so now they are selling their btc
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:06:52
I agree with you, I am in Mexico and buying bitcoins is a pain in the ass, and honestly idk why somebody will buy bitcoins here, you can't buy anything with bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-10-28 06:07:00
yo dawg
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:06:05
SSL error, no thank you.
@_date: 2013-03-06 08:11:47
[✔] not gonna happen
@_date: 2013-04-24 05:00:19
great, a very good reason for the us government to get involved, now lets upload illegal numbers, serials, trade secrets,etc into the blockchain
@_date: 2013-04-19 21:17:35
disable java in your browser asap chrome://plugins
@_date: 2013-04-27 01:08:30
and then somebody sells a huge amount, everyone panics and the bubble explodes.
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:00:38
Could be a case of money laundering?, I mean may be the police tracked a lot of illegal money being exchanged for bitcoins at bitcoin-24 and they believe is a big money landering ring...
sorry for my bad English.
@_date: 2013-04-20 19:28:15
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:50:16
people realized that they can only change bitcoins for dollars or drugs.
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:31:19
it was a wall
@_date: 2013-06-06 05:17:51
install vmware and insidie a virtualized os install truecrypt and create one partition that its hidden and encrypted, hope that make sense...
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:52:16
I think 9 pm
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:35:51
the attacker is getting too predictable, most of the attacks are in the morning...
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:48:26
someone sold like 500k
@_date: 2013-04-28 05:08:39
They can make mining bitcoins illegal
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:24:36
or implement api limits, charge more fees per transactions, there are hundred of things mt gox can do to stop hft.
limit 60 trades per account per hour
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:09:24
the attacker could generate thousand of address
@_date: 2013-04-26 01:25:08
within one minute actually 
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:08:47
Doing the right thing NEVER makes you stupid
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:58:55
could be that they use using google apps for business 
@_date: 2013-04-22 04:12:43
*http packet flood (distributed F5)* LOL, F5 DDoS LMAO xD
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:38:54
buy bitcoins on btc-e then sell them at mt gox, repeat.
@_date: 2013-04-28 04:58:05
you will loss money mining on a macbook.
@_date: 2013-04-16 06:16:39
they go back to bed and cry
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:47:51
About 10% of the trades are for the amount of 0.01
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:47:29
An average miner has a better pc that those morons
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:13:06
20-30 years, and would be a cryptocurrencie much easier to use than bitcoin, inmune to a 51% attack, with instant confirmed transactions, traceable and possibility to revert transactions by a group of trusted addresses. 
If Bitcoin becomes popular expect the politicians to take it down and make their own version backed up by the government.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:57:22
what if mt gox doesnt have enough funds?
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:36:16
is down all the time
@_date: 2013-04-19 05:22:31
disable java in your browser asap
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:49:15
how about 15-30 BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:14:36
