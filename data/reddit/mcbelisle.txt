@_date: 2014-09-13 16:54:50
Doesn't this exist already?
@_date: 2014-10-12 19:35:43
Use xbmc/istream
@_date: 2014-09-24 18:54:49
look again. It's there
@_date: 2014-09-13 16:39:45
Yeah. They allow you to add money to the Bluebird card and a few other prepaid cards. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 23:26:17

Www VirWoX.com
@_date: 2014-10-21 15:32:55
I installed the app but it only shows bitcoin. How do i get colored coins? what are the starbucks points from the picture?
@_date: 2014-11-07 11:25:22
I uninstalled the app and reinstalled and reimported my wallet and it worked without any problems. I did notice it gave me a choice of 12/18/24 words to import. I only have 12. All of my transactions were there with my 18 private keys
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:29:30
with mycelium you need the verification code they give you in order to retreive your wallet. if you don't have that then there is nothing that can be done
@_date: 2014-09-07 08:39:13
I ordered and got ordered completed but haven't received the card. how do i get the card?
@_date: 2014-10-12 19:32:11
You can use cash.
@_date: 2014-06-16 21:15:18
@_date: 2014-12-18 12:57:04
yes i know that but after signing up for their website and logging in and then on some of the menu selections inside of the site it says they are not available
@_date: 2014-10-13 18:04:58
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:58:29
noticed they removed coinbase. will it be coming back
@_date: 2014-07-25 16:34:31
are there plans for soup plantation gift cards?
@_date: 2014-12-31 12:42:39

I created a bitcoin address with HD and the address is not recognized on blockchain. how do i send to this address?
@_date: 2014-12-15 14:20:45
What are they for?
@_date: 2014-08-16 18:04:28
I send small amounts after receiving just to see if private keys are valid
@_date: 2014-10-12 19:31:26
I used VirWoX before with no problems
@_date: 2014-12-07 22:29:00
On my way. I am wearing an Irish hat and blue shirt and jeans. Will be late 30 mins
@_date: 2014-09-19 13:40:23
Scan the backup and enter the encryption key
@_date: 2014-08-05 12:51:35
bip38 just encrypts the private key. It does not encrypt the public key. How do we get the public key encrypted with bip38?
@_date: 2014-12-11 14:45:52
Mycelium or airbitz is better than Blockchain.info
@_date: 2014-11-05 21:33:37
It is possible to have more than1 private key for each public key. There can be 1 bip38 private key and 1 non bip-38 private key. All someone has to do is get the non bip-38 and they can steal your funds. I did this one time
@_date: 2014-09-10 21:33:09
what is uuid? what url do we put in?
@_date: 2014-09-14 20:57:52
I am a man and I don't feel comfortable without a shirt on when I am outside
@_date: 2014-09-13 18:18:54
Yes.takes time to withdraw
@_date: 2014-04-17 11:45:14
I get that error also. What version of android do you have? I am runnning android 2.3.7. I think that error only happens to older android versions. Alot of app makers want people to get newer android 4 phones for some reason. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 22:07:29

@_date: 2014-10-11 11:45:01
also on xbmc/istream for free
@_date: 2014-12-14 19:28:23
They send an authorization email for every login now
@_date: 2014-09-16 21:47:47
you don't say if you used authy? with that you can use a web browser
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:25:28
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:42:12
last year I used it to mine. haven't used it in a while
@_date: 2014-10-09 19:02:05
Why did I get emails for my earnings then?
@_date: 2014-10-12 01:41:30
Need examples of other cards like this. Coin isn't even available yet
@_date: 2014-11-04 11:40:47
All of the links on the page go to hashcoin. How do i sign up?
@_date: 2014-12-06 10:24:07
When are you going to be in California
@_date: 2014-11-20 09:47:22

@_date: 2014-11-19 11:29:09
@_date: 2014-10-18 13:35:25
That's just a links to

easier just to use xbmc/istream
@_date: 2014-10-15 20:40:11
yeah was on mobile. will try when i get home
@_date: 2014-08-12 21:14:36
everyone asks this question. it shows up everyday
@_date: 2014-08-28 15:28:54

@_date: 2014-09-16 01:34:24
They do have Bitcoin listed
 
@_date: 2014-07-25 03:48:51
i have discovered some problems also. i logged out and then tried to log in again with the android app and i cannot find the login button. ended up clicking on the facebook link when it popped up and it asked me to enter a new pin number and i am able to access my account then. it wouldn't let me just type in the pin. i had to put it in as a new pin
@_date: 2014-09-16 20:35:19
It's not complicated. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:43:41
@_date: 2014-09-05 15:34:05
They aren't in USA. Can't get verified

mycelium and airbitz
@_date: 2014-10-12 11:51:50
Site says it has been since 2011. Not new 
@_date: 2014-10-15 16:45:44

@_date: 2014-12-05 23:30:53
gift card with cardflip
@_date: 2014-12-08 13:39:46
I like this. never did this before
@_date: 2014-09-27 00:52:57
I got mine too. on the verification section they list blockchain wallet and a few others but those aren't able to be used
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:46:04
I have an airbitz wallet and like it. airbitz has higher rating on that site than other wallets
@_date: 2014-10-15 20:47:29
the article is talking about virtual credit cards which are run from web apps. These are not actual cards.
@_date: 2014-12-15 21:59:17
Their website doesn't list bitcoins as a payment method. they should have it on there
@_date: 2014-08-28 23:27:46
Use the Xapo app and check balance there
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:39:00
ok. I'm confused. That's not the real question. all currencies are tied together. There is a currency exchange. what changes for the dollar also changes for every other currency. Then say if the value of a bitcoin is nothing in terms of dollars then how do we determine how much a bitcoin is? there needs to be an exchange value somewhere.
@_date: 2014-09-24 17:45:22
This is GoBank. I have had a GoBank account for a while. My account has no fee. How do they say there is a fee?
@_date: 2014-08-07 16:39:14
yeah. I got scammed too. someone wanted to pay with venmo. he also had a phone number not near me at all as in another state. he also used an iphone app to communicate
@_date: 2014-10-17 12:11:37
probably. didn't you save the link to it?
@_date: 2014-10-11 01:01:52
I went to Del taco last night and used my shift card also.
@_date: 2014-09-16 21:41:17
what does  BTT mean?
@_date: 2014-09-10 16:12:08
i looked at that card last year. The issuance fee to get the  card is alot
@_date: 2014-08-15 14:42:07
VirWoX can transfer to PayPal from bitcoin
@_date: 2014-10-10 22:32:55
on that form the person doesn't need your email. they can put in another email account and blockchain will respond to the other email
@_date: 2014-11-16 18:32:57
Why do you want them?
@_date: 2014-10-13 21:46:46
alliantcreditunion.org

@_date: 2014-09-07 15:35:58
i sent them an email and they sent me the gift card manually.
@_date: 2014-10-09 22:48:27
HD bitcoin wallets change addresses
@_date: 2014-10-12 01:12:08
Use a HD wallet. Addresses change for every transaction
@_date: 2016-01-28 22:55:32
Airbitz wallet has a buy bitcoin feature
@_date: 2016-01-21 00:30:28
Do you have other bitcoin addresses as watch only addresses on blockchain?
@_date: 2016-03-12 13:53:51
after the transaction went to 1GDjTqyZZrWRPV397PfGFMU8vBr3ZrNK6W
then it went to 1D935QaSmeFEJLnAYdRQzkyH6SdXhZDVik
so what's a dnm and if the first address is dnm's then they probably sent it to the other address. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 23:19:44
I have a problem with mine also
@_date: 2016-01-25 22:35:15
Try localbitcoin
@_date: 2015-07-05 20:16:10
I understand that but I am in USA and the bitcoin I have i spend. I don't want to cash it. If I wanted cash I wouldn't have have bitcoin
@_date: 2015-07-03 10:31:28
I use it. They pay you to click ads
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:34:10
Who are you? Why would you say this?
@_date: 2016-02-14 02:23:00
Airbitz and xapo
@_date: 2015-04-11 10:02:01

@_date: 2015-11-26 06:12:13
just checked again. url is no longer valid
@_date: 2015-11-29 16:22:14
why isn't ace cash express on your website anymore? i looked awhile ago and didn't see it. I know it used to be on it.
@_date: 2015-11-29 16:23:27
Why would i use it when it costs money to buy the bitcoin in the first place. 
@_date: 2015-11-22 18:44:21
 yeah I had one of those also
@_date: 2015-11-27 06:50:52
Don't believe there is a way to do that
@_date: 2015-11-22 18:09:52
it works for me.
@_date: 2015-10-29 00:43:25
the second one is a change address
