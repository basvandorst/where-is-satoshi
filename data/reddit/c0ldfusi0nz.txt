Sure, but it's not recommended. You can load your private keys into multiple different wallet software, but as soon as you start spending money from that address, your wallets will likely diverge because most wallets generate random 'change' addresses (that you own) that they send the unspent outputs of a transaction to.

At the moment I don't think it's possible to create such a transaction, though it may become possible via use of bitcoin scripts. Taking a step back, however, I believe that you may very well be able to achieve this without paying anyone. I don't know how reliable their double spend detection is, but IIRC, blockchain.info's free public API provides a boolean "double_spend" value in the JSON response for a transaction.

Not completely true. You see, part of the functionality provided by full nodes is to serve requests from SPV clients, AKA lightweight wallets. If there are only 5 full nodes but hundreds of thousands of SPV clients, eventually the node mesh will buckle under the load and the SPV clients will start lagging and timing out.

As I understand it, tree chains is a more elegant way of approaching mining multiple chains by essentially structuring the blockchains in the form of a tree. Instead of trying to have multiple parallel blockchains for different cryptocurrencies, with miners having to manually choose what to mine, we structure them in this tree with rules that allow miners to easily hop around mining the different chains. This is preferable because now we can leverage the huge hashing power of Bitcoin as an umbrella over all of these chains.

It could, but I think it's highly unlikely. We have yet to see the MaidSafe system actually in action, but the simple fact that accessing data over the Internet is orders of magnitude slower than accessing data on a local disk leads me to speculate that trying to run a Bitcoin node with the blockchain stored on MaidSafe's system would result in considerable performance loss.

It depends upon how you use it. For only transmitting value, you can be in-and-out within a block or two. 
For storing value, you'll have to hope that as the market cap and trading volumes increase, so will the liquidity. Many people hope that eventually we will hit a saturation point at which Bitcoin volatility will be similar to top tier government issued currencies.

I guess my final question is this: would it make any sense for someone to create a bitcoind fork that has no changes other than a lot of statistics reporting around how many requests the node is handling, then deploy a few of those forked nodes throughout the network in order to monitor the load?

It's fairly straightforward to see the strength of the Bitcoin mining infrastructure growing by viewing the graphs of the relentlessly-increasing hashrate and thus mining difficulty. What I'd like to learn more about is the "health / strength" of the network with respect to the number of full nodes that are broadcasting transactions. 
It is my understanding that full nodes perform several distinct functions:
1.  full nodes provide lookup of historic blocks, which is necessary for
new nodes synchronizing
2. full nodes provide filtered transaction lookup for SPV clients, which
is necessary for those clients to function
3. full nodes validate blocks and transactions, and relay them if valid
Seeing the total number of reported Bitcoin nodes "drop" from over 100,000 to under 10,000 has has renewed my interest in coming up with a way to determine how healthy the network is and how much load it is experiencing. It seems to me that if we develop a programmatic way of determining this, we could then automatically provision new nodes on virtualized servers in order to meet demand.
@_date: 2014-04-29 15:45:48
Nodeshares may be a solution from a technical standpoint, but as far as I can tell it is not a solution from a trust standpoint. This is further centralizing the operation of nodes on the network.

1) You can build a payment system with revocable transactions on top of a payment system with irrevocable transactions. The opposite is not true. Thus an irrevocable transaction system is preferable as a foundation.
2) It's called scalability. Software evolves; there are a number of scalability solutions being actively discussed amongst the Core developers. This is not a permanent, hard limit.
3) How so?

My main point is that I think people hold The Foundation in too high a regard. Last I checked, fewer than 1% of Bitcoin users are members of the Foundation. It does not represent the entire community - it represents industry interests. We should be very careful about ceding any power to the Foundation or relying upon it.

That's a decent start, but not very fair because blockchain.info's node is only connected to a small subset of the nodes on the network, thus it would only benefit node operators who are lucky enough to be connected to blockchain.info's node, or operators who explicitly instruct their node to connect to blockchain.info's node.

All major currencies trade on open markets. Central banks certainly play a role, but they do not directly control the markets. All currencies experience volatility, it's just that most major currencies have such low volatility that is it imperceptible to the average user.
The concept has to do with the relationship between trading volume, liquidity, and order book depth. As more people use Bitcoin, more people will be trading it on exchanges. This will increase the order book depth, which means that it will take more money to actually move the market price any given amount.

The method for upgrading one's Bitcoin client is irrelevant - if different people are running different versions that do not agree upon how part of the protocol works (such as how many coins are allowed to exist) then the blockchain will automatically fork. The chain that has the most people using it will continue being "Bitcoin" while the other chain will become "something else."

I don't buy the "we need to incentivize people with money to run full nodes" statement. First of all, we don't even know how many nodes are currently needed to meet demand. Secondly, there are incentives to run full nodes: they secure the network by validating transactions and blocks. Anyone with a vested interest in keeping the network secure is incentivized to run a full node.
I suspect that we will see more commercial ventures running full nodes for security purposes as well. This is because when you request information from a full node, is it not guaranteed to be true. Nodes can lie to you (check out "sybil attack") thus is it preferable to run your own node if you need to programmatically check the status of blocks and transactions.

There is no penalty for not sending transactions because of how data propagates through the protocol.
A node will not request a newly seen transaction or block from a peer unless that peer has explicitly sent it an "inv" message saying "I have this piece of data available." Thus, if a node simply doesn't relay the inv messages, other nodes won't ask it for data. Even if a node DID relay inv messages, it could simply respond with a "notfound" message when a peer asks for the data. There is no penalty for responding to data requests with "notfound."

Fractional reserve can indeed be scary, but let me put it this way: for all we know, existing Bitcoin exchanges may be running fractional reserves.

Your number of connections will really depend upon your internet connection and overall responsiveness as a node. The more responsive you are, the more likely other nodes are to connect to you.

First you'll need to convince people that we actually need more nodes. You won't be able to make a convincing argument from a technical standpoint, because we have more than enough to serve the current demands upon the network.
Thus, your next argument would be that we need more nodes in order to further decentralize the network. At this point you're effectively arguing against your own idea because creating a single non-profit entity to run nodes is actually further centralizing the network.

Fair enough, though note that the double spend isn't free - you have to pay a higher fee. It's already recommended to only accept 0-conf transactions for trivial amounts of money.

Note that blockchains do allow appending arbitrary data to transactions, so I imagine this is how you would encode media files "inside" a cryptocurrency. Though the maximum block size for 10 minutes of transactions currently for Bitcoin is 1 MB. If you wanted to encode media files in an alt-coin, you'd need to either make it have a very high maximum block size OR write the media player so that it was able to piece together the parts of the media file that you'd have to spread out across multiple transactions and multiple blocks.

OK, so you're trying to come up with a direct incentivization method. That's admirable, but extremely challenging from a technical standpoint.

You are correct that sybil attacks are a good reason why we should desire to have more nodes.

As a node operator, I'm completely open to entertaining ideas for incentivizing node operators, but realize that is is an *extremely* difficult problem from a technical standpoint. This is because nodes operate independently and do not confirm the honesty of other nodes. This is why sybil attacks are possible. Any incentivization idea would have to come up with a novel solution to proving the honesty of individual nodes in order to ensure that dishonest nodes are not compensated for being part of the network.

There is no way to predict the future price as it requires being able to predict the psychology of the masses along with predicting future events that may make Bitcoin more or less appealing to the masses. If you think that Bitcoin has utility that more people than those who are currently using it will be able to harness, you may speculate that the exchange rate will increase. If you think that a critical flaw will be found or a vastly superior technology will be developed, you may speculate that the exchange rate will decrease.

Ah, yeah that's similar to what Wladimir said on the discussion I linked. Here's the thing, though: in the real world, this is already a performance issue regardless of whether or not somone is intentionally throttling their node's bandwidth usage. If you're way behind on the blockchain and trying to catch up and you start downloading blocks from someone running a node on a shitty connection, your historical block catch-up will be slowed to a crawl. This is because the node's data download logic is not very smart. If it was smarter, it would try to download from multiple sources in parallel and end up using the fastest sources. This is on the TODO list to implement eventually.

Revocable transactions / escrow is needed when you're dealing with a party that you don't trust. However, in many cases the two parties trust each other enough not to need this feature, so might as well use a more efficient system of transmitting value that does  not offer the protections.
Pruning will help with total disk space required by a full node, though to my knowledge it will not help with the network scalability issues. There are efforts being made to deal with network scalability, one of which is Peter Todd's Tree Chains.
Network propagation isn't a huge issue at the moment. Blocks propagate through over half of the network nodes in an average of 5 seconds while transactions propagate through half the network nodes in under two seconds. 
Anyway, you've mentioned a number of weaknesses that can (and likely will) be improved upon. But weaknesses are not bugs. The only actual bug I see you mention was the backwards compatibility issue that caused the fork, and IIRC it was fixed within a matter of hours.

Mark Karpeles, chief executive of Mt. Gox, the embattled Toyko-based bitcoin exchange, resigned on Sunday from the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, according to a person familiar with the situation.
The move comes as amid a string of longstanding technical issues that began last summer when Mt. Gox halted customer withdrawals in U.S. dollars. The problems became more severe earlier this month when Mt. Gox halted all customer withdrawals, saying that a bug in the bitcoin software allowed some users to alter transactions.
The problems prompted CoinDesk to remove Mt. Gox from its bitcoin pricing index earlier this month.
The exchange told customers last week that it was still working on "reinitiating" bitcoin withdrawals.
Mt. Gox is one of several industry representatives on the board of the foundation, which is essentially a trade organization that advocates for the virtual currency. Charles Shrem, another board member, stepped down in January after being charged with money laundering in connection with his bitcoin company.
A phone call to Mt. Gox's office in Tokyo rang unanswered.

You're doing pretty well. IIRC, there are hard coded constants in bitcoind that will prevent you from ever exceeding 125 connections. The only way around this cap is to modify the connection logic within the bitcoind source code and recompile bitcoind yourself.
@_date: 2014-04-12 12:18:54
If you are running the Bitcoin Core reference client, you are running a full node. The number of connections you accept does not change this fact - you are a part of the node network, even if you are not contributing back to it.
There are more types of validation that just the confirmation of transactions via mining and inclusion within a block. As you are aware, a confirmation is "proof" that a transaction was legitimate and not a double-spend. However, as I mentioned, nodes perform some lightweight validation upon transactions that they receive. This validation is what they use to determine whether or not the transaction is worth relaying to peer nodes. 
For example, there are coded fee rules to invalidate dust and spam transactions. Nodes also verify the inputs (by checking unspents in the blockchain), the transaction signature, and attempt to check against double spends (by checking the unspents that are currently held in the node's mempool). If everything checks out, the node informs its peers of the transaction. If the peers have not already received the transaction, they request it from the node.
The nodes all hold the transaction in their mempool until they receive a valid block that contains the transaction inside it. When you get a stuck transaction, it is being held in all the node mempools but no miner has included it in a block.

The TL;DR is that the minimum number of nodes needed for the network to meet demand is unknown. However, my observations have been that we currently well exceed the resources required from a technical standpoint. We could likely continue to function with only a few hundred nodes. However, we DO desire more nodes in order to increase decentralization and further disperse the need to trust any given node.

Mr Poop Lord, economics is all about how people feel. As I have posted throughout this thread, it is OK that the number of nodes is dropping - we're simply finding a new equilibrium.

The incentive is that you want to see Bitcoin succeed. There is not a direct financial incentive like in mining.
My understanding of the ping usage is that is only occurs when there are peers with whom your node is not constantly interacting. The only two reasons I can think of that being the case would be if a peer node becomes too busy talking to other nodes and neglects your node, or if it leaves the network entirely.

How does his patch make it easier for someone to double spend? Any Bitcoin wallet that I'm aware of will not allow double spending from the same wallet. You'd have to have the same private keys loaded into multiple wallets and spend the same coins from each wallet within a small window of seconds / minutes.
The only difference is that when you double spend CURRENTLY, it is the transaction that propagates through the network the fastest that is most likely to be included in the block by a miner. With Peter's patch, instead of the fastest propagating transaction being more likely to win, the transaction with the largest fee is more likely to win. This incentivizes the miners and allows someone who mistakenly sends a transaction to recall it by sending it back to themself. But it will still be just as difficult to perform unless you also run a modified wallet that allows such double spending natively.

I completely agree that it's still too difficult to convert fiat to Bitcoin - you should check out Localbitcoins.
As for 'cashing it back out' - well, you're really missing out on the beauty of a closed loop ecosystem by not simply spending your bitcoins directly.
The number of confirmations required for a transaction should be directly proportional to the amount of value transferred. If you're buying a cup of coffee with a Point of Sale system, it should require 0 confirmations. The Bitcoin network will propagate a 0 confirmation transaction within a matter of seconds.

I speak from my own experience of running AWS-based Hadoop clusters and attending a number of local AWS meetups where I have heard many horror stories of managing web software hosted purely on AWS. The various features that AWS offers are not reliable and you have to spend a LOT of engineering time from an operations standpoint to try to add more redundancy and reliability. As much engineering time IMO as if you were simply managing your own dedicated hardware.

It's called mining because of the method that must be used to determine the solution to a block of transactions. That method is called "brute forcing" which mean trying every possible combination of solutions until you find the correct one. This is similar to mining in that you just start digging a huge hole in the ground and have to look at every bit of dirt you comb through to see if it has what you're looking for (ore / precious gems / etc.)

There are many more factors to consider other than just the load. AWS continues to have reliability problems that require a lot of engineering around.

If they bribed the core devs to commit changes AND bribed the operators of the largest mining pools AND managed to do it without anyone finding out, then maybe. But it's not feasible because Bitcoin is open source software. Plenty of us in the community are watching what changes are being implemented and we would warn the community, which could cause a revolt against any changes that would give anyone an unfair advantage. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:01:45
Well, once you power on your rig you'll need to decide which mining pool to connect it to, create an account on that pool, install / configure the mining software to point to that pool, then watch as your coins are generated. The coins will only exist in your account on the mining pool's server. Once you get a local wallet set up, you can manually (or in somecase set automatic payouts) send your coin rewards from the mining pool to your local wallet. There are so many different choices to make, some of which depend upon the operating system your computer is running that the mining rig is connected to, that I'll just point you to to learn more. I will say that if you have a mac or windows,  has their own mining software that is supposedly dead simple to set up.

This is something I'm still trying to wrap my head around. It seems obvious that the RELATIVE volatility of Bitcoin is decreasing. Though since the exchange rate is increasing at such a high rate, the absolute volatility of Bitcoin is increasing. I'd love to get any input from folks as to whether you think the relative volatility or the absolute volatility of a currency is more important. Obviously more volatility is bad, but which type of volatility affects the users of a currency the most psychologically? My money is on relative volatility being the most important factor, because as the price goes up, people will be using smaller units of bitcoins day-to-day and thus the absolute volatility will affect them less.

No, there is no link between wallets and addresses on the blockchain AFAIK. If someone wanted to link an address to your identity then they would need to find a transaction from your wallet that they could link to you.

The fees are collected by the miner who solves the block of transactions that includes your particular transaction.

There's little practical use for the average person to run a heavyweight Bitcoin client.

I think I'm starting to understand what you're getting at - you're saying that any Bitcoin service that controls a wallet on someone else's behalf could operate a fractional reserve? I don't think that description is quite accurate because a Bitcoin bank can't issue a 'bank deposit' that is equivalent to a bitcoin. In this scenario they would simply be stealing the money from the depositor and lying to them about its whereabouts - this would require that the Bitcoin bank never reveal the actual Bitcoin address of the deposit, as it would then be impossible to hide such a lie.

Basically, the video is correct that banks are leveraged at around 9:1 and they do create money in the form of loans. But loans are not bad in and of themselves as they give people the capital to buy things, which is healthy for an economy. The actual source of inflation is not fractional reserve banking; it is from quantitative easing / the govt printing money like crazy. Fractional reserve banking just amplifies that problem.

Short answer: the fee will be whatever the market decides is appropriate. Remember that YOU can decide what fee to pay. If you're sending a huge amount of value then you probably don't need the transaction to be confirmed instantly, thus you are not as incentivized to attach a large fee. Personally, if I were sending 1 Bitcoin that was valued at $10,000 then I would attach a fee of 0.001 BTC.

The "difficulty" for brute forcing a block of transactions is artificial and is a self-regulating part of the Bitcoin protocol. The Bitcoin protocol aims for 10 minute blocks of transactions - the difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks. Thus, if the blocks are being solved too quickly, the difficulty is raised. If the blocks are being solved too slowly, it is lowered. You can learn more at

You aren't 'charged' any fees per se - transaction fees are voluntary. It is to your advantage, however, to include a fee in order to incentivize a miner to include your transaction in the current block of transactions that they are verifying. Transaction fees are one part of the Bitcoin ecosystem that ingeniously make it continually grow stronger. Because miners get paid fees to run powerful computational hardware, they compete with each other to earn the most fees.

If you mine on your own, you are probably never going to solve a block. Thus you will never get ANY block rewards (currently 25 BTC) or collect any transaction fees.

Their analysis is fundamentally flawed because they aren't factoring in how efficient ASICs are since they have been built for the singular purpose of computing Bitcoin hashes.

A general-purpose CPU is much less efficient because it has to support many more logic paths.

I ran the numbers and can't justify the gamble. The network hashrate has been increasing at ~60% per month recently. If this trend continues and the miners are delivered in early Q2, it's iffy whether or not they will yield an ROI &gt; 1.0. 
The problem with buying mining hardware these days is that you're making two gambles. You're gambling that 1) The exchange rate of Bitcoin will stay the same or increase and 2) you're gambling that you will receive your hardware in time that it will be profitable. Why make two gambles when you can just make one gamble and purchase Bitcoins? Granted, gambling on mining hardware is riskier and has a higher potential payoff. As always, one must decide at what level their risk comfort lies.

In my opinion, transaction fees are one part of the Bitcoin ecosystem that ingeniously make it continually grow stronger.

It would be nice to compare with PayPal, whose net Total Payment Volume, the total value of transactions in Q3 2012 was $35 billion, which equates to ~$380,434,782 per day. Though transaction volume is not really an apples-to-apples comparison to 'total money in circulation' I don't know how to find that corresponding data for PayPal.

Unfortunately you won't find any services that take credit card transactions and turn them into bitcoins. This is mainly due to one reason: credit card chargebacks. This is what makes credit cards generally incompatible with bitcoin.

As others have noted, getting into mining for profit at this time is likely a losing proposition. I would, however, like to explain why I recently purchased a BFL Jalapeño. Even though it cost me 1 BTC and I am only likely to recoup ~0.5 BTC, I wanted to do my part in further decentralizing the hash power of the network. To this end I pointed my ASIC at a mining pool with less than 10% of the total network hash power. While I won't be rolling in money from this endeavor, it does give me some joy to know that I am contributing to the strength of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

It is recommended that you only use an address once. While this will help obfuscate your transactions, realize that there is no such thing as "untraceable" when it comes to Bitcoin transactions. Every transaction is publicly accessible via the blockchain. There are, of course, ways to make it really really difficult to trace, but they are more involved.

As a fellow investor I'll add that since values diversification, bitcoin is a terribly risky "eggs in one basket" investment. Also, bitcoin has very few of the technical indicators that investors like to use to gauge potential investments.
I dare say that the anonymous nature of bitcoin will make it much more challenging for a standard investor to analyze and thus decide to take a position. But I'd also argue that bitcoin SHOULD NOT be an investment in the first place! If you believe in bitcoin as a currency, you should use it as a currency and try to grow the community. Only then will you be rewarded for being an 'early adopter.' When everyone hoards for speculative investing, we all lose.

Does anyone have a link to the "Bitcoin ecosystem analysis" that was posted in the past month or two that basically showed the flow of coins amongst many of the known larger players?

If a few rich people buy 1M BTC, the exchange rate for fiat currency will go through the roof. The same would occur if 1B people bought 1M BTC. However, the volatility of the currency will be much lower if it is spread amongst 1B people. Thus, I prefer that 1B people buy 0.01 BTC each.

It's good news, but probably not directly good news for the vast majority of us. I contacted Fidelity about investing in the Bitcoin Investment Trust earlier this week. The short version is that they will only allow accredited investors to invest in the BIT through a Fidelity IRA. In order to gain accredited investor status, you must EITHER be consistently making $200,000 per year OR have over $1,000,000 in "non alternative" assets. Also, home equity does not count toward those assets.

You can make an argument that investing in Bitcoin is tantamount to investing in the entire Bitcoin economy. By using Bitcoin you are incentivizing businesses to accept it, which grows the Bitcoin economy. As more businesses are added, the utility of Bitcoin as a currency grows, which incentivizes more consumers to buy &amp; use it. It's a nifty feedback loop.

Yep, the fees are completely voluntary. You can create transactions with no fees, but then it's a crap shoot as to whether or not a miner is going to confirm your transaction. It could take hours or days, if it is confirmed at all. I don't think it's quite accurate to call the miners "middlemen" - they are, in fact, the backbone of the entire Bitcoin network.

It increases the network security by creating incentives for the miners to increase the computational power of the Bitcoin network. The reason we want the computational power of the network to be as high as possible is because that makes it more difficult for any given entity to pull off a "51% percent attack" which is a way of confirming fraudulent transactions via mining. You can learn more about mining at 
@_date: 2013-03-30 20:24:30
That's not how it works - you have to actually solve the new block that contains the transaction. You can't merely CLAIM to have solved it - the other peers on the network will reject it. Since 12 mining workers is an insignificant amount of processing power compared to the entire network, the consensus will be to reject the false claims. I could be wrong, but I think the best case scenario if someone did that would be that the 12 compromised workers would end up on their own fork of the blockchain that would be ignored by anyone on the accepted bitcoin blockchain.
