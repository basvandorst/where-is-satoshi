Haha, I love the way you think.  I'm not sure about number one because hopefully the 10% spent by citizens would cast light on what ppl actually want making it politically more difficult to spend the other 90% in a poor manner.  Can't argue with number two tho :)

A clone of reddit, except put all of the content behind a Bitcoin paywall.  20,000 bits buys you a month's worth of access to the content, and allows you to participate in upvoting, downvoting, and commenting.  At the end of every month, 100% of the bits received by the platform are redistributed proportionally to content submitters based on relative level of upvotes.
1. Gives original content creators a platform where they can immediately monetize their own content.
2.  People who are willing to pay for higher quality content can do so in a very frictionless manner.  Pay via Bitcoin and done, they have access to interesting content.  No need for name, address, credit card info, etc.
How to make financially viable?  Sell advertising or reduce the percentage of bits that get redistributed each month to 95% from 100%.

The statements implicitly conclude that a price discrepancy exists between gold and Bitcoin.  No assumption is made that Bitcoin's market cap will grow to match that of gold.  At most, the implicit question is, "to what extent does Bitcoin deserve to be priced like gold?"  I find this to be an interesting question for the following reasons: Bitcoin is scarce (like gold), divisibible (better than gold), transferable (better than gold), fungible (arguably not as good as good as gold), durable, and recognizable---the six characteristics often attributed to money by anthropologists.  Also of interest to me is the observation that gold has been a long-term store of value (for 6,000 years), while Bitcoin is brand new but never before technologically feasible.  So how does this play out?  I have my biases, but ultimately, I don't know.  Tradition vs. Newness.  That which is Physical vs. that which is digital.  Change.  Big themes playing out before us.  Worthy of discussion.

Store of wealth vs. medium of exchange.  Government deficit spending and quantitative easing = increasing fiat money supply globally.  Also, amount of wealth currently stored in fiat-denominated government bonds globally is $55 trillion up from $26 trillion a decade ago.  I believe that Bitcoin is an attractive newcomer to the store of wealth market, which will lead to rising demand for Bitcoin in terms of fiat in the coming years.

Good question.  An asset that is capable of being or becoming a good store of wealth would likely see very high demand, regardless of its spendability.  For example, government bonds and gold both have very high demand, but aren't easily spendable.  Moreover, the size of the gold and government bond markets combined is in the realm of $63 *trillion*.  And, just a decade ago, the dollar denominated value of all government bonds worldwide was less than *half* what it is to day.  This indicates a substantially large increase in the fiat money supply over that time period.  
  
So, from my perspective, I believe that growing fiat money supply + fixed supply of 21 million bitcoins will lead to growing demand for bitcoins in terms of fiat.

I concur.  
  
In 2013, about $320 million of gold was mined per day. Presently, about 3600 bitcoins are mined each day. In terms of new money flow, this suggests that a base price of about $88,888 per bitcoin can be supported, if Bitcoin were valued similarly to gold.  
  
Moreover, $88,888 per bitcoin equates to a Bitcoin market cap of $1.2 trillion (counting 21 million bitcoins), whereas the total market cap of all 6 billion ounces of gold estimated to be in circulation is currently around $7.2 trillion. This suggests, in terms of overall supply, that a longer-term price of about $340,000 per bitcoin can be supported, if Bitcoin were to be valued similarly to gold.

Hoarders, by definition, don't sell or spend.  Thus, how can hoarders, in and of themselves, contribute volatility to the market when they offer precisely 0 selling pressure to said market?  
  
Edit:  I suppose my point is irrelevant.  I think a better response is simply that Bitcoin's value is not derived from hoarders.  Bitcoin's value is derived from the core reasons *why* hoarders (and others) choose to buy and participate in Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is a good store of value to the extent that there is consensus that it is a good store of value.  Similarly, Bitcoin is a *great* store of value to the extent that there is *growing* consensus that it is a good store of value.

Whether a highly demanded asset is commonly spent or not needn't have any bearing on whether a merchant would want to accept it (supposing the merchant can easily convert it to a store of value of their choosing, e.g. dollars.).  Sufficient Bitcoin buy pressure allows merchants to convert Bitcoin to dollars.  This exchange process has literally *nothing* to do with those who continue to hold Bitcoin.

The desire for bitcoin is the desire to hold a portion of wealth in terms of bitcoin rather than in terms of fiat.  With fiat has come deficit spending and quantitative easing (neither of which are bad in and of themselves, but each of these policies has the potential to cause an asset such as bitcoin to appear as a more stable long-term store of value than, say, dollars or treasury bonds.)

Nice response.  On the other hand, I think a better way to critique his point is to emphasize Bitcoin as a store of value, while only acknowledging Bitcoin's spendability as a pleasant (albeit important) afterthought.
  
You see, from my point of view, I find it a disservice to Bitcoin when people speak of it in a way that disproportionately frames it as money/currency.  To me, Bitcoin is a *store of wealth* that has the added benefit of being able to be spent like money in ways that today's money can't be spent.  
  
One statistic that I like to bring to people's attention is that the store of wealth market (just gold and government bonds---ie not even including stocks and corporate bonds) is $63 *trillion*++.  That. is. HUGE!  The 500 billion (in revenues, mind you) remittance market is paltry in comparison.  Moreover, the dollar denominated value of worldwide government bond holdings more than *doubled* in the last decade.  What do you think it will do in the coming decade, given government tendencies toward deficit spending and quantitative easing?  
Put simply, I believe that growing fiat money supply + fixed supply of 21 million bitcoins will lead to growing demand for bitcoins in terms of fiat.  
  
An asset doesn't need to be spent for it to be valuable; it simply needs high demand and/or low selling pressure.  I wish more Bitcoiners understood this.

Using it as a store of value has been very easy for me.  Just buy and store.  (Of course, I wouldn't mind a higher price, but I believe in it long-term).  For everyday transactions my Chase Visa card is admittedly far far better.  The card's integration with Apple Pay is especially cool.  If Bitcoin were to be integrated with Apple Pay as a result of increased merchant adoption and consumer ownership of bitcoin, then Bitcoin would become just as easy to use transactionally.  It also has the edge of enabling special types of online transactions, which I've found to be fun and easy to use.

No, it is not.
  
For every bitcoin that will ever exist, there is currently about 300 ounces of gold in circulation.  However, in the decades to come, the number of ounces of gold in circulation can increase in an unpredictable manner as a result of mining.  Bitcoins, on the other hand, are mined in a predictable manner up to a hard limit of 21 million bitcoins.
