You say that but have you ever owned a Rolex?

Exactly this, and it works both ways.
How many people bought at 1000 and sold at 300. 
How many people bought Enron or Freddie Mac etc etc.
Kicking yourself over what "could have been" is absolutely pointless. I knew about BTC when they were 10c each, and you know what? Legit everyone sold theirs when it hit 1 dollar.
Then everyone sold when it hit 10 dollars
Then everyone sold at 100 dollars.
The reason BTC are worth so much for long term holders is only because **there are so few long term holders**. Every single person thinks that *they* should have been a part of that 0.001% of insane maniacs who refused to sell their BTC. 
But the truth is, by the simple fact that they **no longer have their BTC** is *proof* that they are not one of those people.
So kicking yourself over something that was never going to happen anyways is a waste of time.

Money buys happiness up to a point, you may be surprised at how low that point really is.

Yeah exactly.
BTC hit 1k and everyone and their dog knew about it.
It then dropped to 230usd which it was at like a year ago.
Anybody had the opportunity to drop 10-20k in BTC when it was 230 each and they would have around a million dollars today.

Exactly, I knew about BTC when they were in the pennies, I thought they were dumb then and still think they are dumb now.
Had I bought back then I 100% would have sold the second they reached a dollar.

Don't fret, I knew about bitcoin in 2009 and thought it was basically a scam.
