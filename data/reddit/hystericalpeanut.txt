They have most likely doubled or tripled their holdings on this correction alone.

Jesus christ, $1.8M? I would never trust a single exchange with that amount of money, be it in BTC or USD. Edit: Hope you get all of it back soon, $1.8M is a substantial amount of money.

You lost me at BCH. Although i agree that the altcoins need to be liberated from the BTC pairing.

If you are buying bitcoin because of the hype surrounding it / think its a get rich quick scheme, I would advise you to turn around and do some basic research before investing your money in bitcoin. 
You will need to understand the fundamentals of bitcoin and what it ultimately stands for, so that you can hold it long term without panic selling during every price drop or correction due to possible market manipulation.
Remember that cryptocurrencies may yield high rewards, with equally high risks, and that the forums are full of people spreading 'FOMO - fear of missing out' and 'FUD - fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt' for their own gains. Do your own research / due diligence to know what you are getting into. Only ever invest what you are willing to lose.

Hope some exchanges will provide fiat altcoin pairings in the future. Right now, everything bleeds together with BTC &amp; ETH.
