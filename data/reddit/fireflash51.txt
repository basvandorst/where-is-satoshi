a 5 years old is not a businessman. Stop trying to appeal to people with your stupid child. You're a piece of shit.
And whatever you think about your kid, a 5 years old child can't do shit by himself. he's still learning how to be a human being. he has no idea about business or any kind of serious real world interactions

This sounds like a stupid idea.
If you're looking for a parking spot on a street downtown it will most likely have a meter. So you're not getting a 3$ parking, you're getting a parking at standard meter fare + 3$.
Plus, why would people go through the hassle of synchronizing their depature and possibly wait a few extra minutes in their parking spot for a measly couple of dollars?
And when is the transaction completed? If it's when the deal is accepted, the parked person has no reason to wait for you to get there. If it's after the 2nd person gets into the parking spot that person has no reason to approve the transaction.
And what if some random car shows up and waits near you because he sees you're about to leave? You can't block him from taking the spot instead of the person who made a deal with you.
The only question is whether if the creator of that webpage truly believes that his stupid idea can work or he knows it's dumb and he's only trying to get an easy 25k

Who cares about buying bitcoin. Selling them is the blocker. Just try to sell your bitcoins at the current 'worth' and I'm convinced you're incapable of selling them at that price.
