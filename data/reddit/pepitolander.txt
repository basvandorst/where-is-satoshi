QRdroid can generate an encrypted qr code. Better to print on paper an encrypted qr code of the seed. Your will provides the password to decipher the qr. I think paper is less suceptible to damage/erase than usb, also very cheap to make many copies of it.

The article doesn't really build much of an argument. It simply states it and I suppose it might be right. Blockchain is meant to solve the problem of centralisation. But still many of the problems related to money are not addressed and remain: free market crisis, inequality, speculation and manipulation, etc.

I'm also wondering about this. I suppose that after the split you have to choose which branch to use for a new transaction. Or maybe you could use your btc in both (and pretend you have twice the money)??? I don't know because I don't understand the technical part of all this.

What's the ticket price based on? It would be intresting if they set the price not based directly on USD-XBT rate.
