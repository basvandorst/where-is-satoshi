Banks like Nordea need to realise they can't ban their staff trading Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. How are they going to find out, install spyware on their staff's machines? Cryptocurrency can't be banned.

My favourite Tweet response to this in a sea of serious and semi-serious responses is the Donald Trump parody/bot account:

That's the beautiful thing about a democracy, people are free to make their own choices (good or bad). Cryptocurrency isn't illegal and if people are going to lose money investing in it, how is that any different than say investing in unregulated pyramid schemes or selling Tupperware? If it's about risk, why are banks not stopping people from investing in stocks or gambling it away at a casino blackjack table?
Cryptocurrency is risky, but it's not the only thing in this world that carries risk.
Let's be clear, Nordea doesn't care about its employees or whether or not they could lose money trading in cryptocurrency. This is about control, it's banks reacting to a situation they do not know how to control. Cryptocurrency is a threat to traditional financial institutions, they can't manipulate it, hide their activities (because of the public ledger) or make money up out of thin air.
We saw this exact same situation with Uber. Taxi lobbyists aggressively pursued Uber trying to stop it from entering their industry, they spent money on advertising campaigns, political donations and for a while it did slow Uber down. Now look at Uber, it has all but entrenched itself into the transportation industry, there aren't really many places left in the world without Uber.
Cryptocurrency will win.

It feels like every day the LNP tries to think up ways of controlling the population and restricting their freedoms. Gone are the days of buying a car privately and paying in cash, then.
@_date: 2019-07-29 07:59:39
That's my point. You can sell a car privately on Gumtree or wherever, and it used to be really common to pay in cash, even if it was over $10k. I'm sure my experiences aren't unique, going to the bank and withdrawing that money you saved to buy the car you always wanted and handing it over in a thick white bulging envelope, standing around for ten minutes while they counted it.

Isn't this exactly what [crypto.com]( are doing with their cryptocurrency products? Notably, they're offering a Visa card which can be topped up using crypto (different types), working on direct bank transfers, etc. And they're also working on a credit offering where you can lock up your cryptocurrency and borrow against it, then buy them back when you want to repay the load (allowing you to sell and hold).
I know TenX are also working on a crypto card and a few others on different financial products on the blockchain. There is definitely stuff happening in this area.

This is actually good news. A properly regulated US approved stablecoin to rival shady Tether is something that has been desperately needed for a while now. But I fear the fallout from the damage to Tether is going to have potential consequences on the overall market if the manipulation claims made in that research paper not long ago hold weight.

No worries.
I am legitimately invested into different cryptocurrencies these days primarily for tech reasons. When I started I was chasing moons and lambos like some of the other kids, but eventually I grew up when I realised the whole entire cryptocurrency market is heavily manipulated, emotional and temperamental.
Right now as the market stands, it's tiny and that's why it's a form of gambling. At least in a traditional regulated market things move slower and people manipulating the price are held accountable by government agencies like the SEC.
One of the projects I love is Steem, it hasn't been immune to the recent drops either, but it's tech I believe in and think will have a purpose for content applications. It's a weird feeling investing into a cryptocurrency you don't really care if it rises or falls. I just like it even though I am at a loss with that too.
For as long as a few shills on Twitter can spread fake announcements or hype up a coin and increase its value only for it to drop back down (like John McAfee or XVG Whale who hypes disgusting Verge) cryptocurrency will never be taken seriously.
People keep pinning their hopes on an ETF, but there is a reason the applications keep on being denied to the SEC for a Bitcoin ETF citing concerns over price manipulation and that's not something that can easily be solved with cryptocurrency: it's not regulated and therefore any kid or neckbeard can start a pump and dump group, or Tweet nonsense to drive the price up.
I want to clarify that I do believe in cryptocurrencies, but only the tech applications not from a financial gain perspective. The applications you can use an immutable and distributed decentralised blockchain for have yet to be realised and we are going to see some great products come out in the next 18 months.
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:04:52
You're completely right. When Bitcoin was on its meteoric rise, I don't recall seeing anyone in this sub saying, "Please don't invest, Bitcoin will eventually go back down" it's easy for people in here now to say, "Ha, well you shouldn't have bought in at ath, derp" - the only person I saw signalling alarm bells is sketchy Charlie Lee from Litecoin. He was smart to cash out and he was telling everyone Bitcoin and others would eventually go back down.
I don't think this sub and some of its members realise they are their own worse enemy. Even when Bitcoin was dropping in value people were saying, "HODL!" and "This is just a correction, it's healthy" telling people to hodl while the value was dropping was foolish and sadly some people were caught out.
People naively believe Bitcoin is the future of money (spoiler alert: it's not) it's a digital asset that people primarily buy and trade to make a profit, not to buy every day goods with it (which is a small subset of the Bitcoin market).
Sorry about your loss, man. That truly sucks. I am not at such a loss, but I am currently down 27% and it's not a great feeling. I can't imagine being down 60%+.
@_date: 2018-08-13 21:53:39
These are not dips, they're slow descents into bankruptcy for some of the people here. It's time to admit that Bitcoin will never be $20k again. John McAfee is going to be eating his own dick soon, so that's something to look forward too at least.

That is how I would argue with Peter Schiff, I gave my response.
He claims when you're transferring money that "you're actually transferring something" and when you transfer Bitcoin, "you're transferring nothing". At least you can own your Bitcoin if you have the private keys, the reality of fiat currency in the real world is there is more money in the banking system (digitally) than there is physically in cash you can physically hold.
If your bank goes out of business and the government doesn't guarantee your money, it's gone. A lot of fiat currency in "circulation" is made up, it only exists digitally and not in some safe. The traditional fiat monetary system is built on promises ever since moving away from the gold standard in 1970.
His arguments are biased because anyone who knows how Schiff likes to invest his money knows he is heavily invested in gold and Bitcoin is often referred to as digital gold. The argument that Bitcoin uses excessive amounts of electricity has also been disproven as pointed out [here]( the traditional banking system actually uses more electricity right now, but you won't hear Peter Schiff admit that.
My original point remains. Peter has no valid arguments, everything he says comes from an anti-Bitcoin pro-gold perspective and people should take what he says with a grain of salt.

I've been an investor in Crypto.com way before it was even what it is now, it used to be called Monaco Card and they've really expanded this out into a platform of awesome products. I buy a little BTC through the app every month and it is really easy, as easy as Coinbase makes it. I highly recommend it. Also, if you buy MCO tokens and stake them, you earn CRO each month which builds up over 12 months until your stake vests.
I personally don't trust Coinbase anymore. I think it's dangerous for one company to have so much power and control in crypto, it's not only dangerous (remember Mt Gox), but it just effectively replicates the whole  centralised big bank problem in the real fiat world.
@_date: 2019-06-03 02:05:48
Peter Schiff is a biased gold bull, understandably he would vehemently defend gold and traditional investment methods over new ways of thinking about money and investing, especially if they threaten his investments. I think we have all learned to take anything stock brokers stuck in old ways of thinking like Peter say, with a grain of salt.
Based on the very fact that Peter Schiff and other traditional investors are taking the time to call out Bitcoin and tell everyone how bad it is, how it's a scam and is going to fail, that to me is the strongest bull signal you could ever ask for. Traditional investors are scared and they're fighting hard to stop it.
As we saw with Jamie Dimon not too long ago publicly decrying Bitcoin and buying it behind-the-scenes, I wouldn't be surprised if Schiff is secretly trying to create an entry position for Bitcoin himself.

What happened ~~the emphasis of spending bitcoin~~ on this sub?
In all seriousness though, the idealists who were talking about spending Bitcoin and adoption were only doing so because in their minds it would drive the value of Bitcoin up. The reasoning was agenda driven if more people use Bitcoin my investment goes up and I make a tonne of money.
While most people won't admit this, they're not in it for the tech or ideas of fast spendable e-currency, they all want to be rich and by lambos.

Good for you man. I don't blame you for selling, I did the same 2.5 weeks ago, I couldn't handle the stress anymore. I do plan to buy back, but making sure your kids have a great Christmas is far more important.
Quite a few of my crypto friends have been selling these last few months. People are losing confidence in crypto and it shows. Nobody thought we would breach the $5k floor, but here we are.
The smile on the face of your kids when they open presents and not IOU's is going to be more rewarding than any crypto gains ever could.

I seriously doubt it's going to happen. The concerns the SEC have are serious and valid concerns that cannot be easily fixed. For as long as Bitcoin is easily susceptible to manipulation, it's never going to happen.
The only way we get an ETF is if we allow the government to regulate Bitcoin and we have to ask ourselves is it worth regulation to get an ETF and why do we even need an ETF in the first place? I thought Bitcoin was meant to be its own independent thing that exists without government control or institutional intervention?
Bitcoin is touted as being a replacement for traditional financial institutions and fiat currency, yet everyone is hanging their hopes on an ETF which goes against what Bitcoin was designed to be. Have ideals gone out the window in a quest to chase profits on an investment? Is the short-term gain worth the long-term loss of control if we allow regulation?
Bitcoin has an identity crisis.

$2800 seems to be the price people think it will go to if it falls below $4300. The truth is nobody knows what is happening. Mt Gox is going to be dumping a tonne of Bitcoin out into the market when they start paying people back in 2019, so I would say it's going to get worse.

Eh, I take what the Winklevoss Twins have to say with a grain of salt to be honest. They have a vested interest in Bitcoin succeeding and the price going up, with their substantial holdings as well as investments and exchange. You would never hear the Winklevoss Twins say anything bad anything they have a vested interest in succeeding.
The advantage gold has over Bitcoin is that it is substantially easier to sell for fiat or vice-versa. Bitcoin is at the mercy of exchanges with arduous KYC/verification processes before you can convert your Bitcoin to fiat, not to mention the fees (not a transaction, but exchange fees/margins).
Once again, we have to ask ourselves: do people see Bitcoin as an investment and long-term store of value or transactable fiat alternative? Because you hear the Winklevoss Twins and other influential crypto investors/interests saying similar things, but why gold? If Bitcoin is meant to be a viable replacement to fiat, why compare it to gold when fiat currency and gold haven't been tied together since moving away from the gold standard in the 70's? Nobody uses gold as a currency for transactions, it's a store of wealth, is that what Bitcoin is meant to be?
Bitcoin has an identity crisis. Do you spend it or do you hodl it? Nobody can seem to agree one way or another.

@_date: 2017-09-18 02:42:12
I beg to differ. China likes controlling every aspect of its citizens lives, from what websites they visit and how many children they're allowed to have. Cryptocurrency is an existential threat to the very thing that has been controlled by a select few for so long: the banking system.
Let's be honest, the idea of a currency that can't be controlled like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and other up and coming coins focused on privacy like Verge scares the crap out of countries like China. We'll see it allowed eventually, but only once the Chinese government works out how to control how its citizens buy/sell and trade cryptocurrencies.
People in China are using Bitcoin to move their wealth and keep it out of the hands of the government. Cryptocurrency allows you to move your wealth around a lot faster and all the while, banks are missing out on the interest and being able to just hold your money.
