Fuck, she could've been a part of the pizza holiday! Bet she's crying now that her career has started it's decline.

I did, they removed it. Apperantly they have a rule on no accidents. Which sucks because it hit number 1 spot there in less than an hour

I'm still holding down here with you. I only chipped a little off the top for this beauty.

If you buy back then it's about the same as normal atm fees really.

That's 73% who will be selling us those stocks for our bitcoin when bitcoin breaks 1 million and we want to diversify. Sounds like good odds to me. Also a good signal that we're indeed still very early to the game.

I had a similar one. Lost my wallet, and bank wouldn't give me access to my funds till my cards were replaced in 2 weeks. I had a birthday party to go to that weekend and no access to funds. That's when I remembered bitcoin atm's are all around my city, so I drove 7 miles too one to cash out 200 bucks for the weekend. Quickly bought back what I cashed out and more 2 weeks later when my replacement cards finally came in.

Because by then their buisness will only have returned them 2 =x profits while bitcoin will have brought us 10000* profits. So they'll be fomoing in like everyone does everytime. Last bear run I sold 2 bitcoins for 20 shares of amazon stock.

It's 7 dollars in physical cash, but then you have to minues the 7k in debt so really he has -6993

Limited supply is a part of the equation for increase in price, a big one. The increase in demand/money being put behind it, divided by the limited supply creates the value. Without the limited supply there would be no price increase, causing no increase in demand. Rid yourself of the limited supply and the value becomes volitile to the creators of the coin and if they ever choose to flood the market with more coins like venezuala and the US are doing with there fiat. Making so much of it that it's losing value at a faster rate.

Nope, stock works the same. Your betting someone wants the stock for more cash than you paid for it. Just they sell the illusion of it's value by the companiess revenue/investments/output. Bitcoin is just the money put behind it devided by the supply of said coin. &amp; Demand will always increase, because as long as others see us profit on it, then they will want to come in and profit too, causing an increase in demand, with a decrease in supply because of the halvings, causing the perfect value equation for supply and demand.

I already sold 2 btc at the last ath for 20 amazon stocks. Keep telling yourself what you want to believe, but these transactions are already happening.

Everything is a bubble. Same reason I traded 2 bitcoins during the all time high for 20 amazon stocks. Because I saw people profit on the stock. Congratulations, everything is a bubble.

That's because there is no demand for your shit. There is demand for bitcoin, and the more profits it bring early investors like us then the more the people who sit on the sidelines will want it increasing the demand. Creating the perfect value equation for demand, and supply. Because by the time they come in the next halving will have happened cutting the distributed new coin supply in half, creating the same story we have been seeing for 10 years now of the coin increasing after the halvings.
