What's the difference between a Limit and Stop-Limit?
Say an alt-coin I have is at .0032 and I want to sell it once it hits .0040. I can put in a Limit sell order at .0040, and it will sell whenever it find a buyer at that price.
How does a Stop-Limit order differ from that? I know that the Stop is the price at which it will put your order in, but if I set the Stop at .0038 and the Limit at .0040 how is that any different than a typical Limit order since it will sell at .0040?

So a limit order is ABOVE the market price, and a stop-limit is BELOW the market price?

I have no idea how these people think the government and the Fed work, or what their relationship is

I feel like you are arguing theory while everyone else is talking about practical reality. ***OF COURSE*** in theory bad actors fail and are weeded out and we are left with the most fit competitors, but in reality if you let these institutions fail the entire financial system goes into critical failure- if you thought the crisis and its aftermath were bad, if we had let those huge institutions that controlled billions of dollars go belly up people would be *begging* for 10% unemployment (which is what it was at the peak of the recession). It would have been the Great Depression 2.0 rather than the great recession, and if you can argue that fact with me than I will sit here all night and talk with you because I'm about to use those ideas to win the next nobel prize of economics

Dude you just got proven wrong. What you said wasn't what you meant to say. Simple semantics, you guys both mean the same thing, he just worded it correctly. No need to get defensive
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:20:36
It wasn't *caused* by the government. You could say that some (or much, depending on your point of view) of the blame lays at the feet of the government because they didn't catch the warning signs or regulate as much as they should have, but it wasn't the government that was participating in shady financial practices.
And yeah it's 'a very technical question,' but every answer to that question that includes allowing JP Morgan, AIG, BoA, etc to fail is going to include absolute economic mayhem on the same level as the Great Depression. Can you dispute that point?

I'm honestly just curious- what do you think should happen in the event of a recession / depression? For example, in the case of the financial crisis and resulting recession since ~2007-2008, what would you have suggested we do? If the government hadn't done something it would have been the Great Depression 2.0, and you know this to be true

Haha that's hilarious. "What the fuck is that thing flying around in outer space?" "Holy shit Johnson it's a rocket booster, how the fuck did that get up there?"

Wait, so you're opposed to a nation having the ability to control its monetary policy? I thought we decided that the gold standard was a bad idea a long time ago (which does essentially the same thing- it doesn't let a nation, or anyone for that matter, control the money supply. It proved to be a bad idea.)

What is this gif originally an illustration of?

It's not only the public. The potential for mismanagement (read: corruption) of a politically controlled Fed is far too large to ignore. 
Imagine: one of the parties is in control of the house and the senate, be it democratic, republican, green, purple, whatever. The economy's doing alright, but hey, elections are coming up in a year and we could use a little boost. A few congressmen come up with a brilliant idea. "Hey, interest rates are at 2%. Why don't we just slash those down to 0.5% and see a huge boost to the economy just in time for election season!" And guess what? It works! The economy surges and everyone's happy! Until a few years later when the artificially high levels of employment prove to be unsustainable and inflation is running rampant
I'd also argue that Congressmen are too easily influenced in general (IE, Bank of America can just donate millions and millions of dollars to some guys campaign. When he gets into office, do you think he's gonna say 'no' when his cash cow asks him to consider cutting interest rates because it'll be good for their business?), which is another argument entirely, but for the time being I want Congressmen nowhere NEAR control of the Fed

You're getting downvoted but it's not an awful comparison (certainly not great either).
The similarity you can draw is that they were major institutions in their respective markets- we all know what happened when mtgox failed and how it affected bitcoin. Now imagine a mtgox that is 100x more important and influential, and instead of bitcoin it's the real economy that affects the entire population of the united states in one way or another

Seriously. People here do not have a simple working understanding of the basics of monetary policy or financial markets and yet are presenting their point of view as fact

I know the basic role that the gold standard played in history, but I think it would be next to impossible to argue that it is a feasible economic model today (I have no idea if that's what you're trying to argue haha)
Also, I just read a little blurb for the book which stated


This seems to be arguing that because humans are fallible, humans should not be in charge of monetary policy (and that we should have a gold standard or something comparable instead). Of course the people in charge of monetary policy (the board of governors of the fed / FOMC, aka central bankers) can have terrible consequences if they are wrong. This is no less true than saying that congress can make terrible decisions that affect millions of people. That does not mean we should get rid of our government (or the Fed). 
In modern times, these people are sooo much better informed and aware of how their actions affect markets and the economy as a whole. It is my understanding that the Great Depression got to the stage it did because those in charge refused to conduct sufficient accomodative monetary policy (or fiscal policy) until it was too late (ie, FDR's presidency / WWII). This also seems to be what most people are suggesting in this thread (just let them fail! They deserve it! The government shouldn't try to help the economy!)
The book seems to be absolutely fascinating from a historical perspective, but I don't think that it says much that should be informing modern day policy that isn't common sense

HA! I laughed so hard at this, if I was in charge of naming it (and didn't have to worry about getting sued) this is what I would call it 100%

So what would you suggest that the nation's monetary policy to have been? Let those institutions fail? That would have been much worse for the ordinary US citizen
The economy blew up (due to irresponsible management / practices within the banking industry to be sure), but you can't lame *the fed* for the fact that wage growth is low. They've been doing everything that they can to resuscitate the economy.
The simple fact is that those banks (and AIG) were literally too big to fail. The fed could not let them fail without *catastrophic* consequences (this is simple fact). Now, I agree that being too big to fail should not be allowed, but that would require the *Federal Government* (Congress) to pass regulatory reforms, which the Fed has no control over. So while our politicians continue to fuck up everything that they can, the Fed is just trying to keep the US economy healthy. I have no idea why the Fed gets so much hate on this sub
