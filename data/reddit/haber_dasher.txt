Yup. Very frustrating.

I had a Coinbase account for a couple years. Made 2 (fully legal) purchases from that wallet spaced out by many months but was mainly sitting on the coin waiting for the value to go up.
One day I get an email from Coinbase saying that they've decided to close my account and that their decision cannot be appealed and they are under no obligation to tell me why it's being closed. I combed through their ToS and my account was not in violation of any clause in the terms. I sent them a polite email expressing my shock &amp; frustration along with directly quoting the part in their Terms that outlines under what conditions they'll close an account and showed that I hadn't violated any of it. I closed by asking what could be done to rectify this and if they could share with me their reasoning since it was clearly not about anything in the ToS.
They emailed back telling me that if I needed a new wallet to transfer my coins to that I should just Google it.
Fuck Coinbase.

Coinbase has no problem deleting accounts for any/no reason at all. I had an account for years I used to make occasional purchases (nothing darknet or anything remotely sketchy) and one day out of the blue they emailed me saying they had closed my account and I had to transfer my coin to another wallet or lose it. I hadn't violated any terms of service (I checked, thoroughly) and they literally refused to tell me why they were closing it and the customer service person actually made fun of me and pejoratively suggested I didn't know how to Google Bitcoin wallets to find a new one.
Fuck them.
