They did sponsor transportation for Bitcoin on the Beltway. And this will mean Lyft will do it also to compete.

Dude, if all of our problems could be solved by our criminal justice system, there wouldn't be a market demand for Bitcoin. Don't suddenly go braindead because you're afraid of the law. People steal EVERY DAY, and that needs to foremostly be dealt with as locally as possible. In the case of Bitcoin, it's an engineering problem that will eventually be solved for faster transactions. Or Bitpay and others will move to an off-network system.
@_date: 2014-08-03 09:11:17
Visa isn't a bank. It's a sales terminal. We're still waiting for our Bitcoin sales terminals. In the meantime, this wins. I think eventually Bitpay and others will be smart and create software to add Bitcoin options to regular terminals and allow cards like Xapo's to direct spend Bitcoin at no fee to neither merchant nor customer.
@_date: 2014-09-20 12:31:51
For now, network effects and a more widespread and auditable blockchain. By the time banks try something like this, say central banks or something, Bitcoin will have been the network having survived a long time without turning its back on its users. Ultimately, we'll have to slowly improve the protocol with ideas that take into account individual incentives. It's quite possible this iteration, with its current fundamentals, could survive indefinitely with just the rational self interest of large miners to not mess up the public's trust of the system.

The better question is why in the hell Wikipedia is making you give them personal details to donate.
@_date: 2014-08-22 12:05:30
I agree. Simple US-based exchange.
@_date: 2014-08-03 09:05:26
That's not the worst thing in the world. Especially if it's simple to miss payments and just "turn it back on." Hopefully that's what it is.
@_date: 2014-07-10 16:52:33
It is really not that hard to ask your users to pay. This is already handled in the even a card held is declined. Wasting money doesn't help anyone. If your service is worth forgetting about, you shouldn't have to pay for it, too, and will lose money en masse when the veil falls.
@_date: 2014-08-10 14:01:13
I think you have in your mind places during crisis or war specifically and don't exactly realize that while there may not be 21st century habitation, there is a fair amount of order and market activity everywhere on earth where there are people. Among common infrastructure is mobile phone service. They're not speculating with Bitcoin. There's real use.
@_date: 2014-08-22 08:18:32
The combined nebulous list of wrongdoing e.g. you spook us or we don't like you and the resulting penalty of immediate account shutdown. This is how paypal and every other old world merchant processor does business and not in the spirit of Bitcoin whatsoever.
So what if something is illegal? Investigate it. Stick up for your customers. Don't just throw your hands up and people and their funds under the bus.
@_date: 2014-07-20 09:07:18
I completely agree. I don't like how we're ostracized as unrealistic or wrong either. Bitcoin could have easily been centralized at a hundred times efficiency. But why was it decentralized? Because government crushes every competitor ruthlessly.
Is it impossible for government to wipe Bitcoin from the earth now? The network you bet. We are small. But the idea and its ability to get hundreds of times better is forever. I'm never going back.
I like running a business in Bitcoin and taking digital payments worldwide. I like investments in Bitcoin. Hell, I have even donated more in my life to different causes because of Bitcoin than ever.
Bitcoin is the promise of individual empowerment and the gall of people to defy external control. I don't care what you feel politically, that is the ONLY reason why Bitcoin is amazing for the world.
@_date: 2014-09-21 15:10:51
Overstock seems to care quite a bit.
@_date: 2014-08-02 23:58:32
Once Xapo is known as the Bitcoin debit card company, they will be able to negotiate better terms. More importantly, they will be able to forge relationships with companies like Bitpay that allow their cards to be used at Bitpay-accepting terminals. The result is that legacy equipment will be able to easily integrate Bitcoin options. It's all part of early adoption.
Like people are saying though, if you think you can do better, PLEASE take our money! That's the miracle of enterprise. If Xapo is screwing us over, shut em down and profit!
@_date: 2014-08-03 04:16:09
How big does it need to be for you, someone outside of it, to find it valuable?
@_date: 2014-08-03 09:04:08
Because it is. Bitcoin isn't even 1.0 yet and about a hundred thousand times better as a clearinghouse than our crony system. Bitcoin or a nimbler group of altcoins will solve all commodity transfer problems in a decentralized manner in time. And not 20 years time either. Are you retarded? Nothing moves that slowly in tech. More like 2-3 max.
And at this point I really dare them to just say "well we're banning it" or we're extremely restricting its use. Because they will piss off so many people that there will be an impetus to add even more to the technology that makes it anti-state.
All problems are well-known and being worked on. 51% will be fixed with something better than today's proof-of-work. Someone will create a mini-chain that's open source and allows for centralized blockchains to be used for point-of-sale and equity trading, which means point of sale will be centralized but open source, there will be dozens of companies constantly entering into it to the point where devices will be interoperable for whoever comes up next.
Dude, we're hydra-mode. Don't even get me started. This hasn't even begun, but these fuckers are already waking up the sleeping giant of a pissed off Internet.
@_date: 2014-08-10 07:55:14
Thanks for that!
@_date: 2014-08-11 21:59:01
The better bottom line is that Bitcoin solved both instances.
@_date: 2014-06-21 11:47:28
Absolutely love it. Makes Bitcoin seem more user friendly while at the same time making you feel like you want to be rich in it.

I'd love to see a video response by Stefan to this.
@_date: 2014-07-27 08:20:18
I prefer Bitcoin but hate all inefficiencies converting to USD or even with merchants because I feel that the market isn't reflecting the fact that Bitcoin IS more valuable than USD and other fiat yet.
@_date: 2014-09-15 02:50:03
Good news
@_date: 2014-07-27 08:02:01
Which is why instead of talking about regulations, we should be making the network and protocol stronger.
@_date: 2014-07-01 09:53:47
There's nothing wrong with holding onto Bitcoin. If you believe its value will increase, then it is quite literally one of the best forms of saving we have in this world. Deflation does nothing except increase the competition for your money, and there's nothing wrong with that. And in terms of Bitcoin's perpetual rise in value due to what we call hoarding, that will increase the incentive of companies to want to accept Bitcoin today, so you will see lots of steep discounts work their way into stores who want you to spend an appreciating currency on their wares.
TLDR: It's all good, baby.
@_date: 2014-08-03 09:07:37
That's how they pay the dudes to run the exchanges profitably :). It's a fixed cost versus a margin at swipe... I don't mind so much.

If exchanges were pegged to bits, I think we would see a skyrocketing base price and a dampening in volatility as the market grew. Many people feel they missed the boat when you talk hundreds of dollars a Bitcoin. But when you let em know what mere pennies on the dollar buys in bits, I think you'd see big adoption.
@_date: 2014-09-21 15:11:34
Overstock and BitPay are invested into Bitcoin's success.
@_date: 2014-08-03 09:12:04
So much this. You are their target market, and you're doing it well. And things will only get better for you as they prove their market traction.
@_date: 2014-05-28 01:42:06
Bitcoin's network effect is damned near impenetrable because something self-evidently working against it would be fixed and adopted by many stakeholders as its share of world wealth increases.
@_date: 2014-05-31 23:01:05
Innovations in its use either with popular processors like BitPay or Coinbase or through improvements in the network itself will eventually usurp all other things as a medium of transaction, in my opinion.
I'm sure it seems crazy to say it, but more or less other currencies will fall to the side as something like Bitcoin becomes the default exchange tool. Cash is just not as useful, and no one really likes the inflation part of it except those who touch new money first... not very many of us.

The chart doesn't look that bad when it's small like that. Just looks like there was a bubble and a strong rebound. :)

The protocol facilitates the exchange. There is no necessary trust you must provide a third-party with your value.
@_date: 2014-08-02 23:52:32
Why's that? Bitcoin doesn't solve point-of-sale transactions whatsoever. You still need a last-mile network.

Alleged operator. Even these fools act like a case is nailed shut once they kidnap someone.
@_date: 2014-08-03 09:55:58
Some things change and some things stay the same. Not sure why you think globalized central banking is one of the things that stays the same especially since it's only been around for about 100 years.
@_date: 2014-08-11 21:57:38
This is the biggest evolution in currency for this reason alone. I would even say that this is Bitcoin's major comparative advantage. Neither private nor quasi-public inflation counterfeiting occurs. Its value long-term is predictably sturdy in theory as network growth accelerates.
@_date: 2014-07-14 05:50:26
Thank you.

You definitely can "be your own bank," but I think a healthy part of the Bitcoin economy is keeping the money safe and having competitive products and services to fill this void. Trezor is good for personal management, but services that use best practices can be just as good and allow people to worry less about their own security. In short, the more we have, the better.
@_date: 2014-12-14 13:39:27
I think the best currency maintains price stability, actually. So whatever you want to call a "currency" will have price stability. I think Bitcoin as a digital commodity being useful for the transfer of value is here to stay, but I think things will still be priced in currencies that at least appear to have a stable price level.
@_date: 2014-06-21 12:02:35
Now we need to build an incentive for competitive transaction fees into the network. 5000 bits to move money is way too much.
@_date: 2014-08-04 11:48:11
I'm trying to do this myself but there doesn't seem to be much demand here.

His whole issue was that exchanges were bad in his country though.
@_date: 2014-08-03 00:11:18
That's a zero confirmation transaction. If someone really wanted to, he could create a wallet specifically to go around zeroconf spamming and stealing from Bitpay.
@_date: 2014-08-03 05:23:48
This incentivizes people to work for Bitcoin because they're reducing daily friction. The fees aren't too bad for those who love Bitcoin but no longer want to feel like second-class citizens.
@_date: 2014-08-10 12:05:53
Yes. Bitcoin's relative stability is a wonderful safe haven for third-world countries looking to move away from local currencies. And people may not have reliable internet but they have reliable SMS, and that's how Bitcoin is beginning to take over most of the African continent.
@_date: 2015-04-06 23:45:11
The catch-22 is that the more Bitcoin is used as a "transport layer," the greater its utility for end users.
@_date: 2015-04-11 03:06:08
I think the point is that talent is leaving legacy banking for Bitcoin. You can disagree with the banking system, as do I, but it's hard to argue they don't attract stars.

Closest thing I've found is ZipZap for Bitcoin. It's between 1 and 2% in practice off of say a BitStamp price.
