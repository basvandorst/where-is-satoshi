China government is not banning Bitcoin here. They are just regulating banks to avoid risks brought by these exchanges. BTCChina is the bitcoin exchange which complies best with all the existing regulations and is most likely to pass the examination conducted by banks and survive.

We do not care if big whales want to join us or not at present. But we do care if there are as many innovations brought by Bitcoin as we need now. If there were and would be, then the whole Bitcoin economy will bloom and eventually those big whales will have to join us. So be patient and watch Bitcoin to grow.
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:57:39
Because they have to. They know they will never win a war against bitcoin.

Some governments do want to ban the Internet, if they can. But they couldn't? Why? No government can bear the burden of losing the vast improvement of economical efficiency brought by the Internet. They will be outcast in the global competition without the Internet, just like North Korea. Considering bitcoin, it is the same thing, and even more important. Money is the blood of economics, and bitcoin is a very efficient money and more, a rapid-growing ecosystem. So I am very optimistic about the future of bitcoin, even if for some short-sight reason China banned bitcoin, they will be back very soon, and shamefully!

Never mind, they sell bitcoins only because the market is bearish now, they will hold coins when it becomes bullish.
@_date: 2014-04-06 00:27:10
I am in a 3rd world country. To me, Bitcoin is not money. It is all about freedom. We will enjoy next level of freedom brought by Bitcoin after the Internet bloom.

a direct translation from the pronunciation of English word 'bit'.
@_date: 2014-04-26 15:10:26
No, it is not rumor. At last I realized that Chinese government is banning Bitcoin, in effect. Or they are just trying to do so. They just won't let you know at the beginning. That is the way how they do any things.
And now, they have just asked the banks to close withdraw option too. But there are many fights going on there behind the scene, I guess, almost for sure. So stay tuned, there will be more and more 'rumors' come out.

I think debit card payment in China is non-reversible. Never hear that happened.
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:39:35
OK, maybe you are right. Maybe I just want to see good in bad, too much? Let's be optimistic, many unusual things happened in this magic land, and wish good luck bitcoin in China.
@_date: 2014-04-01 19:12:57
-Either China keeps up with the pace of Bitcoin, or gets outcast by the rest of the world. So eventually they have to board the train.
@_date: 2014-07-29 00:35:46
But maybe they could shut down coinsafe and everything is over? And still, every local store buying and selling Bitcoins has to obey AML and KYC rules, I think.
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:44:04
Anyway, most of those things happened behind the scene, and nobody knows exactly what is going on there.
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:18:16
No, I am not. I am just thinking about it and questioning about it.
@_date: 2014-05-28 05:35:03
Could you make netvend database and backend server decentrialized in the future? I really like the idea, but hate the implementation. Some countries are banning Facebook and the like, cannot use them.
@_date: 2014-01-22 11:19:27
but it is not a headline. ;-)
@_date: 2014-09-04 12:19:42
or sudo kill -9 Bitcornd ;-)
@_date: 2014-05-01 22:43:21
I didn't see that, of people go missing part, as a native in his thirties.
@_date: 2014-04-06 00:37:07
And your wallet is your own bank, which is enabled by the Bitcoin network. Just like that.
@_date: 2014-03-12 06:36:27
All those CEOs can join the foundation too. Not bad for them, eh? ;-)
@_date: 2014-07-26 01:07:22
Nothing wrong with your idea. But in general there is no need  of a bank account for using Bitcoin. It is important that un-banked people can use Bitcoin. Coinbase just makes that impossible.
@_date: 2014-03-29 05:19:20
Do we need a bank in the end?
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:09:36
China government never said they are going to ban Bitcoin. They are regulating banks and bitcoin exchanges, such as tax declaration, enforcing anti-money-landering, etc., just as all the major countries in the world do, but somehow in a stealthy way, which caused many misunderstandings and rumors.
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:22:49
Because the tradition of Chinese government is keeping everything under control. So I won't be much surprised if they say they are going to do it by themselves.
@_date: 2014-07-25 14:29:33
Yeah, NYDFS makes it very clear, any centralized services, such as coinbase, bitpay, etc. is going to be doomed.
@_date: 2014-03-17 03:13:28
Got it! If the price go down (most of time), you gain more and more bitcoins; if goes up, you can still buy anything you want, am I right? Genius!
@_date: 2014-05-03 23:18:31
How about using recently emerged side-chain technology to implement this?
@_date: 2014-04-05 04:15:40
Never mind. They will be back soon, if they are really going to ban it. I am almost sure of    it. Know the history of Alipay (Chinese version of Paypal)? It is almost got killed by the Government back then, but now many of its competitors emerged, and are prosperous! Why? Because they would suffer the lost of a lot of job opportunities created by the new eco-system, and they worry about the economic growth very much. 
@_date: 2014-05-19 22:56:43
So it is useless for people in China? They need the ability to transfer money using ANY bank service out there available, anything like OKPay or PerfectMoney will not be allowed there, at least at present.
Refunding is not a big problem in practice, since most of them only use debit card solely.
@_date: 2014-01-22 00:41:08
FYI, you can send sb in US some bitcoins, then she could buy sth on overstock.com as she please. Thus avoid any unnecessary fees,  haha!
@_date: 2014-04-13 09:34:08
Yeah, specifically, Chinese rumors and Western news, at least this time? ;-)
@_date: 2014-04-05 03:45:42
Use the Internet as an analogy, what would happen if we do not have Internet now?
@_date: 2014-03-21 09:52:21
Yeah, many 'Bad' sites are banned in China, for 'Good' reason. ;-)
@_date: 2014-04-06 00:33:24
Why do we need a bank any more when we have Bitcoin? When I want to buy something from you with Bitcoin, just give me your address, then I can use my wallet hosted on an Android phone, which connected to the Internet by 3G network, to pay you immediately. Let the banks go to hell. ~~~
@_date: 2014-03-29 08:17:54
What a splendid idea! Great!
@_date: 2014-04-05 03:54:05
I mean, when everybody accept bitcoin, then there is need for conventional banks involved.
@_date: 2014-04-26 01:52:12
The most shameful drama has just been presented there, yesterday. At last I found out, according to the messages sent out by the press there, they just wanted to ban the bitcoin,  no,  they have not say anything like that yet, and they will probably never say something like that, but they are just in effect trying to kill bitcoin mass adoption there and to keep the price down, trying anything they could although without any success, until now.
I do NOT know what will be going on  there in the future, nobody knows, even including the government themselves, because the struggle against govemnent bull shit will be never ending and not all of the members in the government are so stupid enough as not to  see any benifit brought by Bitcoin and the underlying technology. What I do know is the most fierce struggle, fight, and panic will be found there, from now on.
So I think, maybe in vain, "Let China detach as we did with Gox"  may be the best attitude, at least for the present.

1 Eventually you will have to let most of people to access these decentralized websites without actually hosting them; then
2 How do you incentivize more people to host a full network node? The more people hosting a full node, the whole network is more reliable and easer to access.
3 Scalability is probably the biggest issue in the future when the network grows bigger enough, I think. Do you have any specific ideas to handle them at present?
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:05:07
Yes, you are right, in a way. That is one of many explanations from the latest public information. But I can also conclude, from those infomation, that they just want to keep the price low and trading platforms under control, can I?
