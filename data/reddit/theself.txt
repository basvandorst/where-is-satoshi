I don't see why not. I think I'd go all-in!
Edit: I think its the other way around. Its not Ver who's challenging, Ver is being challenged by an unknown btc bag-holder

Contrary, that's a reason NOT to sell

Of course yes. It’ll be worth much more than a $1 million dollars the day the US economy collapses

Do they accept debit/credit cards?
// Credit card &amp; bank transfer works for sure
How extensive is their verification?(ie. pay stubs/ Identification / Mail etc.)
// Its surprisingly very simple, convenient and quick. I had to send them a copy of my credit card, picture of me holding the card, identity proof copy and their compliance team verified my account in under 10 minutes.
Is there a limit once signed up?
// If you buy high volume they will ask for additional, detailed information-- seemingly to comply with AML laws
If I buy say $2,500 worth of bitcoin by debit or credit, is it instant or do I have to wait a week or some shit for it to clear?
// Its instant. You fill orders via their exchange
Once signed up, do I have a small limit that I must work up from or can I poretty much just buy $1-2K of BTC right out of the gate?
// If you intend to max daily deposits, aside from their standard verification, you shall be asked to sign anti-AML forms, fill in a questionnaire, and submit additional income copies and screenshots of your BTC wallets from other exchanges.

 The circulation of bitcoin gives its value. If he does not buy the pizza with the bitcoin, the bitcoin is worth nothing.

Statistics talk for themselves.
​As per bitinfocharts 54% of bitcoin wallets contain less than 0.0001 balance. I am assuming majority of these are dead/duplicate wallets, and discarded from the list below.
- 74.25% (4.4M wallets​) contain 0.001 - 0.1 balance
- 16.55% (​1M wallets​) contain 0.1 - 1 balance
- 6.71% (​400k wallets​)​ ​contain 1 - 10 balance
- 2.19% (130​k wallets​) contain 27% of all existing bitcoins (10 - 100 balance)
- 0.14% (16​7k wallets​​​) contain 65% of​ all existing​ bitcoins ​(​100k​​+ balance​)​
92% of economy is controlled by only 2.33% wallets
​With the bitcoin prices soaring, will only make it difficult for existing and new users to buy​ larger units of this crypto. Looking at the current growth, users who could invest 1 unit today will only be able to purchase a fraction of that over the next couple of years. This will further increase the gap between the large and small wallet holders. 
Bitcoin usability CAN only increase with stability in the market and that probably may NOT happen any time soon w/ such volatility. 
I am eagerly looking forward to the day when Amazon.com accepts bitcoin as legal tender. That's probably when we know its NOT a bubble anymore!

Smaller amounts will pass through the scanner. Anything big you attempt will definitely catch the eye of FEMA and that could probably get you arrested or at least impose a hefty fine along with a income tax scrutiny. RBI is a cunt and will do everything it can to stop a domicile from selling INR even in this case where the Government barely understands cryptocurrency. If you still insist to go ahead and risk, do remember PayPal charges at least 5% commission and the outward USD forex charges will be an additional 5% or so making the margins super-thin! 
Based on experience, highly doubt anyone would sell you BTC for PayPal (or any other similar reversible payment form) unless you know him/her very well. You could buy BTC w/ your Indian credit card at cex.io at 3% premium, but if your bank finds it out, they could immediately cancel your account(s) w/o asking for any justification.
My 2c, buy what you can through legal channel, and hold on to it. It should be a great investment when you look back at it 4-5 years from now. If it works use bitcoin for your regular payments wherever possible or for online shopping. The site purse.io offers upto 15% discount on Amazon purchases and I'm sure there are other decent venues for us to save some money!

Say you buy 1btc from him on credit, sell it on Indian exchange for fiat currency. Now, how do you intend to buy more btc to send back to this dude at cheaper price than you sold?
@_date: 2016-12-22 15:25:41
There's no legal way to do it, unless you export goods/services.
@_date: 2019-06-23 19:18:26
That’s 15M.. yeah agree that it may be risky

Buy more? I am assuming you already own bitcoin.
It’s more probable there will be a better opportunity to buy “more” next year or so
