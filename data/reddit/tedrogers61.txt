Very clever marketing on behalf of Genesis.

This is what I suspected. I think you put it rather well!

Order books have limits \- good to know.
Not whining, just trying to educate myself.
Who said "manipulation" was "scary"? I certainly didn't intend to convey it this way.
Is it just because it is one of those kinds of words, like 'exploit', which also have negative connotations? You can 'exploit' the good weather, or 'exploit' another person. Both meaning have a positive and negative connotation depending on the context.

I'm happy to see the L and X! Great exposure, for all.

I agree. If anything, even if it just raises a positive profile / image of BTC / crypto in general, and reduces the amount of fossil fuel electricity used to mine it all, that's a win win. Crypto solves world energy problems? ;)

And I thought my disdain for chartists (especially on Twitter) was off the scale! Yours, my friend, is legendary. I salute you.

Great stuff! Just checked out your shop. Wish we had more stuff like this in the UK. I'll be getting my next tee from you with crypto. That will be my first crypto purchase. Gotta use it, not HODL. HODL a bit, but spend too.

That's a really interesting way of making crypto work as a 'spender' for people like ourselves who want to use it instead of, or alongside, fiat currency.
It might be a great plan to top-up in the dips, and then spend as the value (hopefully) increases. That way your end net spend should get less as BTC/crypto value increases.

Ahh, good, so it's not per\-merchant / per\-channel basis...it's one channel (a pre\-pay / pre\-loaded wallet) for all LN accepting merchants I might happen to come across. Such as [

I'm having huge problems syncing this. It just does nothing. It's not verbose either, so hard to tell what is going on. Running lnd.exe manually from within the unzip path isn't very easy either. It was my hope to run this and get some verbose output on the issue, but the syntax is different to what I'm familiar with, and I can't get it to run, e.g. need to specify [bitcoin.active]( or [litecoin.active]( in the command, and I'm not having much luck.
Can anyone else get this to sync? Using Windows 10. I might try Linux later \- that will probably work like a charm!

I just did my first [shapeshift.io]( and it took about 15 minutes. Bit annoying, was getting worried and it just came through to my wallet as I'm typing this.
It's not always cheaper to use an exchange,  although probably faster and less confusing. I wanted to spend a very specific amount, so calculating the miner fees threw me a little. No way my Mum could do this - so therein lies the problem with cryptos!
I did a side by side comparison over two days recently, and my usual exchange fared worst on one day and slightly better the next. To be honest, to go through this level of rigour to gain a few extra coins just wasn't worth it, but it was interesting I thought. I certainly wouldn't do it every time though, unless I was spanking huge wods of cash (which I'm not!)

Thanks for this super detailed and clear reply. I'm really getting into the idea. I've been playing about with Eclair Wallet on my droid today. Got some testnet coin from a faucet I searched for...it was generally very easy to buy a fake coffee, and send remaining faucet funds back (just to be nice, and I didn't really need $9000\+ in fake BTC anyway!).
What I am finding unusual is that of course the value of the BTC fluctuates throughout the day, so a coffee in the morning might be more expensive than a coffee at night. That is weird. I'm used to seeing that on an exchange, but conceptually (when thinking on spending some funds on something) it's odd to have to consider whether it is financially a good decision to buy a coffee when the market (BTC value) down or sideways.
And that's the real rub isn't it...BTC still fluctuates so wildly that it will probably dissuade people, and mass adoption of a wallet system like LN becomes a lot more difficult, even though it is a LOT easier than it has historically ever been (and way way cheaper) to spend small amounts using LN.

I like your style dude. I'm planning on spending crypto all the time, wherever possible. All I've bought so far is clothes mainly, as that is about all I've managed to find and have a use for. Keep doing it. No use, no value! Hit the nail on the head.

Because Satoshi Nakamoto and Charlie Lee are standing inside with their smartphones out, hashing blockchain transactions on demand.
