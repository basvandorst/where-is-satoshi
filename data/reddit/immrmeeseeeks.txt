Could you please give me a website to read up on this? I didn’t want to google anything and possibly read illegitimate sources.

Same. Hopefully it crashes lol

Right, but this is when the price would be the highest so people might try and sell before the fork. I’ll have to see the data from the last fork.

That was the original surge, but not the 6k surge

Do some research by googling Bitcoin Gold Fork. From my understanding, some of the community didn't like where Bitcoin was heading so they're basically copying the "code" and making changes which would cause a fork and create a new coin called "Bitcoin Gold". That's why there is Bitcoin Cash right now, but I've heard everyone say it's always shitty. Just keep your money in Bitcoin.

So from my understanding is that people were looking for a quick way to fix the size issue, and segwit2x will do just that, but the issue is what happens when it gets too large again? Are we going to double the size again and again and again? I don't know much about how it all works, but someone must know of a better way lol

This is the current percentage:
