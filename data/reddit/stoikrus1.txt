I see. I guess that's true where banking is 100% in the private sector like the US. Here in India, about 75% of the banks are owned by the government and it has been running a large financial inclusion program to bring under-banked population into banking.

The flip side of that argument is that in countries like India there is a very large cash economy. The government can't regulate illegal trade or collect taxes in the cash economy. Not to mention the rampant corruption that comes with cash. That's why, atleast in India, government is pushing to move away from cash.

Yes quite cool. A person can sell his services online and receive payment anywhere in the world without opening a account or the paperwork hassles

The only flip side is that there are groups who will use btc for illegal trade just like drug dealers or sex traffickers use cash right now. Which will then force governments to regulate btc transactions

This could be because retail demand for gold in India (the largest retail market in the world for gold) has plummeted because of Indian government's recent move to demonetizatize 86% of currency in the economy and gold is mainly bought using cash in India.

Indian here. Indian banking system is highly regulated and I won't be surprised if the central bank imposes heavy regulations on Bitcoin if it is seen as a way around the syatem. I'm not holding my breath for Bitcoin in India.

If bitcoin becomes too big that it starts hurting economies that have capital controls, the governments will intervene and regulate it. In the same vain they will also mandate disclosures about transactions above a certain threshold to prevent money laundering, tax evasion and financing of illegal activities. That's how financial regulations work. IRS already defines cryptocurrencies as an asset class, no different from commodities or stocks. So its already governed by IRS rules. Rest of the rules will get formed as btc pushes legal boundaries.
