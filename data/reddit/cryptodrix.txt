Could you please explain the stock to flow image?

Nope, this is what adoption looks like

So I line up at the electronics store and buy a new tv, i pay with bitcoin and then step aside and wait a further 10-15 minutes for one confirmation. As other shoppers tap their card and walk straight out the door.

When the thing it's looking to replace happens instantly it needs to do either the same or better... pretty simple imo. Bitcoin could be the answer but not in its current state

Like I said not in its current state...

My understanding of the lightning network is a payment channel has to be set up first between each new person. And then transactions after that are instant?

If that's the attitude and level of assurance retailers are getting as to why they should adopt bitcoin as a method of payment I'm not surprised it's not getting adopted. 
I tend to agree more with the argument that bitcoin is like digital gold. Not for daily trade.

One confirmation can take 10-15 minutes. Bitcoin really needs to speed up transactions imo if it's going to take off
@_date: 2017-09-10 09:43:20
I don't understand how this works, does the person just wait around until it gets three confirmations?
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:00:05
Even if the transaction was for $1000 i would want some degree of assurance as a retailer. Not it's to small of an amount to try and scam. Where do you draw the line?
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:02:40
Why do you think they don't?

The solution to all these problems is bitcoin needs to be controlled by AI that makes decisions on when a fraud has occurred and when to reverse payments etc. full trust needs to be placed in an AI system.

Isn’t bitcoin deflationary

This is not the case today, frees are added to all transactions
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:09:34
Yes
