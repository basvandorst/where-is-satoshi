So are you giving back now?
@_date: 2014-12-09 13:34:07
Would love to help out
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:30:28
I think it's a mobile app, but I have been looking into Breadwallet for that.
@_date: 2014-12-23 15:08:54
Yeah I've got friends that come to me freaking out at every one of these "death blows" but you've always gotta keep a cool head.  Good luck to you guys in 2015. Happy holiday and keep up the good work!

Currently in the process of installing Armory, and using Blockchain, but probably going to switch to Coinbase.  Any advice?
@_date: 2014-11-06 02:47:28
Late to the party, but sharing is caring?
@_date: 2014-11-06 02:45:04
Woah this is crazy! If I can get my MC backup and running I would love to join you.  In fact, gonna go get on that right now.
@_date: 2014-11-06 11:06:50
Hehe fair enough, it's 6am and I've been up for 24 hours doing this Bitcoin thing. It's hard for me to identify anything other than hostility at this point.
@_date: 2014-11-06 07:42:04
Yeah shame you missed out on the big pot :P it was a good effort.
@_date: 2014-11-06 09:05:25
Sweet baby jesus... Do I just stop commenting all together?  I need to sleep, but I STILL HAVE TIPS TO GIVE.
It's 4am.. halp.
@_date: 2014-11-06 04:41:28
The one thing that I don't understand is picking a wallet.  Like what if the wallet provider shuts down? Will all my BTC go away?  If I get a static wallet, what if my hard drive crashes?  I mean it doesn't matter much cause I've got like $.03, but I am considering investing in more and spreading the word.
@_date: 2014-11-06 11:07:14
Follow the links the 
@_date: 2014-11-06 09:21:39
Why is that?
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:36:14
Wallets - Which are most reliable?  Most convenient for purchasing and selling?  Most used/trusted cold storage and mobile storage?
Investing - Is it advisable for a newcomer to start investing now?  Or will the price continue to dip?
Tipping - In your opinion, will tipping remain popular?  Or is it just something that will die out in a week or two?
Thanks :D
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:29:41
Not sure if you're trying to tip, but you have to tag @_date: 2014-11-06 07:36:18
It could be a ninja edit, but didn't comment that 2 minutes before this guy did?
@_date: 2014-11-07 04:31:26
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:26:28
Holy shit this is ridiculous, all you tippers are doing the world a favor!  How should I go about getting started in tipping?
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:31:31
Oh wow good on you!  These tips also really promote good comments on Reddit because you can get rewarded with actual, useful money.
@_date: 2014-11-06 10:27:35
yeah it's all just in good fun
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:33:16
I'm fairly certain that no fees are taken til January 15th, 2015.
@_date: 2014-11-06 05:37:09
Well considering that it's going on "Pre-sale" and the goal is to earn money by using the app, I am going to have to do a lot more reading cause I am still very iffy on it.
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:32:54
I feel like saying ($0.000001) wouldn't be very efficient or useful, but you never know.
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:01:15
thats a lot of bits
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:46:24
Same with Abe Lincoln, I've got a quote framed somewhere in my room from him.  If I find it I will definitely post it in a couple hours!
100 bits @_date: 2014-11-07 04:36:22
Okay cool
@_date: 2014-11-06 07:42:46
Hehe it would appear so, mine is the exact opposite :O
@_date: 2014-11-06 09:41:25
Oh yeah I didn't think if that. It essentially doubles the comments in threads. Wow yeah it couldn't hurt to just have the bot send private messages! Although for today the extra comments were great for exposure.
@_date: 2014-11-06 04:35:05
Blockchain is a great wallet! Thanks for the cool video!
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:49:45
I know holy shit I can't stop.  And anytime I'm running low people like you fill me back up again :D
@_date: 2014-11-06 09:19:48
So much Changetip exposure today led to *a lot* of people joining the Bitcoin community.  I haven't looked into it, but I am assuming that lots of growth in one day will lead to it becoming a trending sub.
@_date: 2014-11-06 09:00:40
EVERY TIME I GET LOW AND THINK THE MADNESS HAS ENDED!
I can't escape this lol
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:29:45
Yeah I want to purchase to tip, but I guess I've got a couple free tips to give now :D
20 bits @_date: 2014-11-06 05:32:37
Thanks for all your help!
100 bits @_date: 2014-11-06 08:42:24
It's people like you man!  Honestly seeing this just makes me so happy..  Time to go spread the love.
@_date: 2014-11-06 05:24:08
Wow thanks for the tip!  Completely unnecessary, but greatly appreciated!  Have you heard of this new app that's going to launch called "Gems"?
@_date: 2014-11-06 10:48:40
Oh sorry, did you want me to hand out $1000 to a stranger I've never met on the Internet? Fat chance
@_date: 2014-11-06 09:13:03
Is that a bet against me? ;)
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:47:34
Isn't the general consensus that this was intentional disposal of old mining equipment?
@_date: 2015-01-26 19:38:39
What does the opening of the Coinbase Exchange change for me as a consumer? Does this change the way I buy or anything?
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:12:41
 :D
