Since my friend had sent the coins to an address that he had the private key I was able to recover them, if you sent them to an exchange then you are unfortunately at the mercy of the exchange. But I had another friend just yesterday accidentally send ETH to the Kucoin coin KCS wallet on the exchange and it actually just showed up as it should have

But only because their servers have such high demand. Key distinction being high demand, nobody even sees any value in dusting bitcoin cash despite having the same vulnerability. It's almost as if nobody wants or needs to bring bitcoin cash's price down because nobody thinks it's overvalued. :)

Bitcoin is broken, too many people on the network, we stole bitcoins name, resisted change, and now nobody wants to use our centralized network but God damn the fees are low.

I told my gf the same thing, that she can let me know when and I'll pull out 1 BTC for a ring. She has not let me forget that one. At this rate it will pay for the ring, vacation to propose and the honeymoon. This time next year it could also probably afford us another house too.

You might call it censorship but to force PayPal to have a customer they don't want for reasons other than those protected by non-discrimination laws would be infringing on the rights of PayPal. They as an organization have a right to decide who they want to do business with, Alex Jones has no rights to be a PayPal customer.
I understand that's a narrow view of a much larger picture but these companies do face legal exposure for helping facilitate his message whether it's through video hosting, audio streaming, or accepting payments for Alex Jones' businesses.
Nevertheless I would go so far to say as these companies are not censoring Alex Jones by not allowing him on their platforms. If somebody gets banned from a particular gym that gym is not censoring that person's fitness, the gym is simply not letting that individual use get fit at their gym, that person still has every opportunity to use other gyms or means to get fit.

If the outside pressure is from other businesses I have no problem with that. If the government for reasons other than charges filed in court with due process was putting on pressure on PayPal then I would absolutely have a problem with that.

There is such a thing as I even mentioned in my OP called protected rights you numbnuts. 
They differ from state to state which is why you can discriminate against gay people in some states and but not be legally allowed to discriminate based on sexual orientation in another state. But we all know which side of that debate falls on that debate, shame!

Is my local news station censoring me by not letting me sit at the news desk and talk about what I think? No, because I have no right to use their platform to broaden my message, end of story.

Of course. 30% drop doesn't mean it dropped only 30% but rather it dropped at least 30%. In fact the 95% drop from 2011 is included on the list of 30% drops. So yes, it would be.

Leading up to the hardfork? I have been following Bitcoin since 2012, but leasing up to the hardfork I was not sure Bitcoin would survive. Everytime I doubt Bitcoins survival it always ends up being unbelievable buying opportunities.

Last I heard none of those websites were stopping Alex Jones from giving his shtik. Did they have him chained up somewhere stopping him from doing his show? Is Alex Jones suddenly not able to post videos on the internet at all? No, they are simply stopping him from using their service. Businesses have a right to decide who they want their customers to be. What you believe is that Alex Jones should be able to censor the rights of the businesses to determine who their customers are. But your inability to grasp this is due to your own cognitive biases. Thoughts and womps

Cost-benefit analysis. Companies do this all the time, Amazon will ban your account if you return too much (because they're not making any money off you). Nike likely performed many CBAs when deciding on the Kaepernick ad campaign. All the companies who withdrew ads from FOX News likely performed CBAs to determine the negative publicity from their association with FOX News would outweigh the benefits of continue their ad campaigns.
PayPal evaluated the positive and negative consequences of continuing to keep AJ. They likely had a lot of eyes on them after other companies took action.
Why do you think companies don't have a right to decide who they do and do not want to do business with?

So is my local news station censoring me by not letting me sit at the news desk and talk about whatever I want? Because according to you that sounds like I have that right and the news station not letting me use their equipment and licensing to broadcast my message is in fact censorship, right?

I had somebody message me saying they wanted to interview me on Skype for a research project about bitcoin... 
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:58:47
I am in a similar position as you, I need to realize some of these gains. By March of last year I had already put in quite a bit into BTC and I was debating between another deposit into BTC or $1k to reserve the Model 3. I can already see what the cost of that Tesla down payment cost me and Idk... My expected arrival date for the Model 3 is as early as April 2018.
As fucking badass as it would be to own a Tesla I am having the hardest time actually biting the bullet. I know in as early as a decade I will be much more thankful if I used the funds to buy an investment property.
But I am extremely jealous of your purchase and especially the color and wheel combo. I almost wish I could just get the car but I know I need to use this once in a lifetime opportunity to invest in my future, which is one of the most difficult and adult decisions I have almost made thus far.
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:18:46
IMO, the general consensus is that the CME will cause the price to go up so any mental barriers of $X,000 price will be superseded by their understanding of the opportunity cost of not going in
Also understand where the value of announcements like the CME futures (or any news for any public trading company) comes into play with the price of bitcoin (or any stock). As soon as that announcement is made people are going to begin making trades on that announcement. Traders do not wait for the final product to be released before finally buying in on the news or the added value comes to fruition.
Again IMO a portion of the price build up of bitcoin in October was due to the fact another fork was expected in the middle of November. Not only that the future price of Segwit2X was almost $1,500. People were actively buying and trading a coin that did not even exist yet and valuing it at $1,500. So buy buying into bitcoin at whatever the current price was at that moment you could estimate a dividend worth up to around $1,500. That is a lot of incentive for people to buy into bitcoin before the split driving the price up. The fact that the price was going on meant for many it was better to get in sooner than later.

I don't even know what these numbers mean anymore, I remember around last December people speculating that a $7k price by end of this year were viewed as insane (and I was one of them).

You never want to depend on somebody else to keep your Bitcoin safe, whether they have insurance or not.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:36:48
It all depends on how close we are to $10,000 as December 10th nears. We have 14 days and as of now $1,265 to go.

So long as they don't have a gag order it is in their best interests to be transparent with those whose personal information they are releasing. Hell even reddit will notify you if your account info has been handed over to the govt.

The hot wallet portion was already mentioned but even if it was insured you still don't want to let an exchange hold your crypto. Say they do get hacked, the payout would not take place for some time. Insurance isn't just going to up and pay tens to hundreds of millions of dollars without a very very thorough investigation and understanding of what exactly took place. Even if you did actually get paid back the value would likely be pegged to the USD value at the time the theft occurred. You would not be reimbursed for the change in price and you likely would not be reimbursed in bitcoin. Although getting paid back for the USD value at the time the hack occurred might work out in your favor seeing as what has happened in the past to the price of bitcoin whenever people learn an exchange was hacked.
But was the reason you needed to keep your bitcoin on Coinbase because of fear/difficultly of storing your bitcoin yourself or quick trading access? If you are using Coinbase please, please, please be using 2-factor authentication with Google Authenticator or Authy and not SMS. Also do not re-use that password anywhere. Make sure the email address your Coinbase account is attached to also has 2FA along with the secondary/fallback email for that email address. Finally, make sure when you do add the Google Authenticator/Authy that you write down that seed and keep it somewhere safe in case you ever lose or destroy your phone.

For everyone who doesn't know this is possible since any time you execute a sell order to fiat or trade one crypto for another you now have a capital gains income or loss to report. This is regardless of whether you actually put that money back into your actual bank account.
