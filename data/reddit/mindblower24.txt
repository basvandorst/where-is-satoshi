This is some interesting stuff.. I wonder if the wait for the ETF is holding BTC back, theres no reason for all shitcoins to be up 10% and 15% in the last few days and BTC hasnt even break over 6600. Hope all the alt gains goes into Btc once it starts running up.

I won't be happy until I see a break above 6800

What can I say the Zen that emanates from within me is beyond your ignorant comprehension. You behave like a spoiled little lad.

Some of you are annoying af, shut up and let the damn thing run up, stop talking about lambos and instead focus on setting college funds for your kids and grandkids. With that being said lets moon ��

�� Sure, allow me to instruct you, get them a baby lamb, and name the lamb “O” and there you have it, a very wise investment specially if is a she cause it can have many more lambs. ��

Then, �� invest wisely, put your money into property in which the depreciation value of an asset is minimal, buy a Lambo now and the moment you drive it from the dealership it depreciates by 10%
