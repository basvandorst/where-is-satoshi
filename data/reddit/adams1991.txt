You seem to hate Bitcoin for some reason.
Here have 100 bits @_date: 2014-05-30 22:37:40
I still wanna eat those candied bacon donuts. 
All at once.

You're the best! Thanks for doing this!

THIS is why I love this community.

Work sucks, but try to have a good weekend! Maybe get some pizza and beers after work? 
Have 100 bits for spreading the joy! @_date: 2014-06-26 03:26:28
I think that guy shot the idea down just to get a response from a UFC fighter. This sounds like a wicked idea Chris. 
I only have like $25 in Bitcoin, but I would be more than happy to support a UFC fighter.

Well I believe there are many people like myself who are fans of both MMA and Bitcoin who would love to get on board with this. 
I really think this could add a whole new element of being excited before and during an event. 
Good luck man! I look forward to this. 
You are gonna crush Bruno.

As a Canadian, I would enjoy those candied bacon donuts.
Or anything I could eat.

My favourite thing is the comradery within the community to turn Bitcoin into something bigger than it already is.

I would say it's pretty big that Ebay is considering using Bitcoin. That could be huge. 
[Here]( is my first tip outside of the Bitcoin community!

Alright I tried to go for it, thanks a lot! 
* Bitcoin is a crypto currency that can be transferred anywhere in the world for a relatively low price. Bitcoin is a network; it becomes more useful with the more people who use it. 
* A Bitcoin wallet comes with a public key and private key. The public key can safely be given to anyone to move Bitcoins IN the wallet. The private key must be kept safe and not given to anyone; this is the key used to move Bitcoins OUT of the wallet.
* Bitcoin is created by a mathematical process that rewards Bitcoins to people who dedicate their computer's power to the network. There is no third party intermediary or central authority that controls Bitcoin.
* The software required to create and store Bitcoin is straightforward to use and open source. This means it is free to download and run. All transactions are stored on a public ledger, viewable by anyone. 
* Unlike other currencies, there is a set limit on the number of Bitcoins that will exist, which is 21 million. A Bitcoin can be broken down and bought/sold in smaller units, the smallest being a Satoshi. 
* Bitcoin allows users to determine who they will trust to handle their financial services, just as the internet empowered users a new way to access information and determine what news they follow and trust. 
* Bitcoin allows one to move value across the internet. Bitcoin as a currency is just the first step.
