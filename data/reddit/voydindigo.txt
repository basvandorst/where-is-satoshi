You must've gotten lucky then, a lot of people have their BTC stuck in limbo

Be one hell of a good way to buy a shit-ton of cheap BTC on the other exchanges so they can cover their asses and open up withdrawals again
Anyone wanna bet that, as soon as the floodgates are opened, that they get slammed shut again real quick?

Ok then - just have it that anyone who hits over a set threshold gets the handicap - and tht handicap increases as their share of the network hashrate rises
It would succeed in taking the wind out of the mining race, bring a lot of smaller miners back into the game, and ensure that no-one person or group could possibly gain a controlling share of the network
It's like what they do for horse-racing - each horse has a particular handicap in order to ensure the race is as even as possible

"Once the implementation is complete customers will again be able to deposit bitcoin, but we will be doing extensive testing before bitcoin withdrawals are reactivated."
MtGox is now officially a Ponzi scheme
"please give us your bitcoin - we have older customers wanting to get theirs out and we need yours to let them..."

Umm....   blocking most withdrawals for the last several weeks?
Blocking all for the past two?
That's the sort of action an insolvent bank does when there is a run on it, not the action of a solvent institution

Try not to leave it out in the rain, Ok?

Now here's a great way to instill confidence in a platform - 'I don't like what you say about us so I'm closing your account and stealing all your money' - good luck getting any future business with an attitude like that

BTC withdrawals started going wrong on the 25th/26th of January 2014
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:23:18
Deposits permitted
Withdrawals not 
Do the math
It's classic Ponzi behaviour, they need new BTC deposits in order to be able to pay the people wanting to cash out. They are just hoping that more people want to buy into their scheme than leave it before they shut the doors, cut their losses, take the money and run
@_date: 2014-01-09 13:13:27
how many solo miners are going to be able to generate more than 10% of the network hashrate though?
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:43:35
doubtful, very doubtful
@_date: 2014-02-20 11:13:26
I guess they've not been taking in enough new BTC/Fiat to cover the expected run
classic Ponzi scheme end-game

1.3 BTC 8 days ago and still bupkiss- it's not just the larger amounts that Gox is having issues with
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:01:45
you were  very lucky - I've had mine stuck for almost two weeks now
@_date: 2014-02-20 11:22:36


fix'd that for you
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:34:49
If he's lucky
Given the amount of money tied up right now? 
Well....  anyone know if the Yakuza accept BTC or DOGE?

Pfft - all different masks covering the same face
All roads lead to the same place, and all deities are ultimately the same one - we just give different names to different aspects of THAT WHICH IS because we monkeys are dumb

No - I believe in the God with Many Faces

Not really - and I'm taking a very long-term view here. BTC will not be around forever, it will be supplanted by something else
But the idea behind it? That has legs, that dog will hunt, and it's one of the better things to come along in a long time
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:56:45
The other night I overheard three old crusties in the pub avidly discussing Bitcoin and all the implications it, and the other crypto-currencies hold
That's when I knew it had traction and will end up being a true game-changer. When the old boys who truly aren't all that computer-literate are discussing it - you KNOW it's got legs
Stay the course, ride the lightning, once the storm passes the value will just rise even higher. All that's happening now is a market correction
This too shall pass
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:09:20
Doubt it - the market has corrected itself several times in the past - only to rise to much higher levels afterwards
overall? the value will continue to climb - crypto-curency is the way forward - fiat currency is dying, which is why all the banks are shit-scared of any and all altcoinage

You're assuming that most day traders buy in in the morning, and then cash out only once, at the end of the day
So long as you are increasing your holdings, you can ride each bump and still be giggling all the way to the bitbank
