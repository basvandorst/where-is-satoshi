This is exactly what I was thinking 1.5 years ago when I started investing. And I invested too much at the start which made me lose quite a bit of money... I actually made more by investing 100-300eur per month, instead of 1000eur when I thought I was timing the market right.
Just start buying, and stacking up satoshis.

If developers decide to change the rules of bitcoin, they will need to fork the blockchain, therefore creating a new coin. Thats how other coins started to appear 7-8 years ago. 
In my opinion, when taking about global adoption bitcoin is not so much like the dollar but more like gold. Its a store of value, and not for daily trading, and it has a limited supply (just like gold). And the way I see it, today we can talk about having 1-2 bitcoins, i imagine in the future, we will talk about satoshis... 'i just bought a real nice gaming pc for 45k satoshis' for example.
And about lost bitcoins in dead hands.. yeap, no idea how they are gonna solve that.

Some are lost because people lost the private keys. And others are (as some guess) just very long term whales hodling. I've seen posts here of accounts with millions in bitcoin, that suddenly transfered everything to an exchange after years of inactivity.

Yes, only up to 21 million bitcoins can be mined.

Mmmh... there is not really a company. Bitcoin is closer to a software ran by decentralized nodes... so, there is no boss or management, just developers working to improve it. And it's code was originally written saying there will only be 21 million.
