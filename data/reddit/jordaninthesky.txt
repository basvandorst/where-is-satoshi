Btw, Reddit doesn't control btc.  So pretending that censorship on a psuedo news site is what controls the function of btc is delusional.  There have been many lies and misinformation about btc since its beginning.  Btc doesn't censor.  It is or it isn't.

This!  Coinbase already stated that they are pro xt, and intends on using it.

This is a cool concept.   Thanks for that.  I really think it is okay how core is working, and that the percieved bottleneck of 1 mb is a great opportunity to truly appraise btc's value to the world of greater economics.

The spam attack comes in the form of thousands of microtransactions that pay no transaction fee.  In effect, the network has been "spammed" for the past several years.  Only recently has the spam decreased because of the priority of block space is given to paying and meaningful transactions.  The full blocks are how spam is being mitigated.  You can still slip in the occasional spam payment, but the incentive behind it is constantly decreasing.
If and when the fee market and btcs growth finds an equilibrium, then maybe a blocksize increase is the best idea.  But realistically, without a blocksize increase this will just reserve btcs real world application to big wealth.  There's no saying that mini blockchains that work for relative microtransactions cannot be introduced.  In fact, that's what is being encouraged.  Blockchain in blockchain in blockchain.  And maybe one blockchain to rule them all.  Lol.

Ok, so btc is failing as long as it doesn't adopt a bigger block.  It hasn't failed, such the way that Mike Hearn expressed.  
Please look at my other posts for more indepth explanation as to the relevance of a fee-market.  I understand that it would be nice to see people paying for coffee with btc, but it is more important that btc is self-sustainable in the long run.  It may be that BTC becomes the new shadow group behind every transaction in future currencies.  The blockchain is of the most secure thing out here.  The fee market is a proof of its value.

So you are speaking on behalf of the people who don't speak.  Why don't you campaign for Hillary instead.  The slippery slope is a valid point, and if another altcoin could innovate and be ahead of btc in terms of longevity, then I welcome that impossibility.

@_date: 2016-01-19 07:46:35
So you want to quadruple the efficacy of the block and ignore the incentive of a fee market altogether.  The fee market is what will actually determine a real world valuation of btc that is more tangible than anything else.  Why fear that?  Would you prefer BTC to remain a pyramid market instead of self-sufficient?

No it's not.


Bitcoin is not an exact clone of the internet.  It has been built gradually, and more or less reliably from the ground up.  If 20 years ago, you wanted a jpeg to download faster, crying on forums would have hogged bandwidth.


People do it all the time and claim it's free speech.  They often get upset when mods delete their content.  In this situation, a spam transaction is transaction that is sent in order to tax the system without repaying it.

@_date: 2016-01-20 03:03:58
So I could call anything btc and it would be on topic?  The fact of the matter is that btc is determined and delegated by the miners.  What determines btc is the consensus of miners.   If classic were to take on the majority, then of course it would be referred to as btc.  As long as that has not happened, it is not btc.
@_date: 2016-01-23 16:08:48
Most to lose, most to gain; either way it is impulsive.  I notice people trying to quote Satoshi to suggest that a hard fork needs to happen now because he didn't intend for blocksize to be 1 mb forever.  I don't actually know what Satoshi's intended path for the blocksize is, on a permanent level, but I do know he was wise on letting the project growing slow and steady, that he encouraged the importance of strengthening the protocol as opposed to caving into social or economic pressures.  It's important that the world can see btc survive when all limits are pushed.  A fear driven protocol will inevitability cause the greatest harm in the greatest way possible.
@_date: 2016-01-19 23:10:25
Block size is also a security control.  It was decided on through experimentation.  I know its be great if btc was used for coffee all over the world.  It just may be.  But the proposal to raise block sizes to make that accommodation goes against Satoshi's incentive control.  This step in dilution of the btc protocol is truly what's abhorrent.  You will see.  Right now you could be mining on bitcoin classic and talking about how amazing it is.
@_date: 2016-01-20 07:07:42
I'm not the one saying he contradicted himself.  You are the one suggesting that he has to for what I said to be accurate, which is a false assessment.  Also, transactions are still free, if you want.  They just are significantly longer to confirm.

You said that core is alienating people.  You inferred that it was because they weren't catering to the masses.
@_date: 2016-01-19 06:10:55
That seems like contradictory sentiments.  I understand the collision between people wanting to see btc transaction free for everyone (for more "immediate" mass adoption, if it might be possible) vs. A fee market (which ensures miner incentive beyond blockrewards).  However, regardless of what direction is adopted by the security holder of btc (miners), btc will continue to have its own niche market to secure its own type of success.  Mike Hearn contributed a lot less to btc than major media implies.  It is more apparent that he wanted to be more apart of the development than he actually was.  He was more jealous than he was objective, which is why his hissy fit created chaos, instead of chaos happening before his "explanation". 
@_date: 2016-01-17 05:56:58
Yeah, that's exactly the firewall in place that keeps btc unchanged and and therefore more people will understand it over time, instead of letting the pace that it could change deter from its reliability.
@_date: 2016-01-23 15:52:14
Whatever people feel like they can change, they will try to change.  I am OK with the outcome, but I don't think being vocal about it is the same as starting a node or a miner.  These psuedo lobbyists are just trying to find their place.  I'm only offering options.

Should I take over their work because I'm afraid and think it'd be more convenient to say whatever is popular?  This non-issue has been an attack on the esteem of core.  If you don't feel safe with BTC, maybe you should not have money in it.
@_date: 2016-01-11 11:34:23
While I know that I am being down voted by those who are very obviously pro xt, a %51 attack is the token concept behind the idea.  Seems like pro folks value their own form of censorship, which indicates that core and xt will become two different independent chains.  Xt will become an altcoin because as it takes territory, core will isolate itself from it.
If you truly believe xt will happen, then you will keep your Btc on a core wallet, not xt, while speaking for xt publicly.  So when the two chains divide, you will have Btc for both sides of the fork.  You will be an honest hypocrite.
@_date: 2017-03-27 04:58:59

Most?  Did you go all the way to China to get that input?  %90 of the noise filling up blocks are just the noise of folks testing the system.  As soon as anyone contributes anything they find room in the next block.  What you are proposing not sustainable.  You admit that a competition in fees might be necessary but can you figure out when is the appropriate time?  No one is forcing anything.  You are so loud for being such a cheapskate.  You want btc to operate for free, based on what you feel is good, not based on the integrity that is btc.
It is the demand that creates the competitive fee market, and it is a healthy part of btc.  You are just nervous because you think btc might die if you don't "fix" it.  But if everyone dropped everything and did it the way you say, btc would die instantly.
@_date: 2016-01-08 07:03:30
The "controversy" isn't a controversy.  It's an attempt to hijack the protocol via %51 attack under the guise of a rhetoric.  If it were to succeed, it'd compromise the percieved trust in the network and encourage more lewd actions by programmers that hold the name of the prominent mining platform.  Hard forks were never a desire until you got a group of impatient people wanting to artificially boost the value of the network by compromising its security.  There is no problem with a fee competition market, especially considering that it would keep mining relevant by providing incentive with the prospect of growing rewards in the future.

Your interpretation of the white paper is several years over due.  I accept btc for what it is.  I signed up for it several years ago, and I am grateful to see the fee market finally materialize, as suggested by protocol that was put into place over 4 years ago, if btc were to become so successful.
You just lacked foresight and assumed unlimited free transactions.

Smart Contracts were always a good use case scenario for bitcoin.  The reason you were down-voted was because you were not encouraging the development of such, but suggesting the backing of an altcoin.

Not true.

What goalposts?  I am a miner who votes with the direction of my machines.   I already understand that despite all the talk that occurs and the lack of respect miners might receive, its their hashing power that sustains the security of the protocol.  If core cuts off xt's intent by pushing an update that renders xt incompatible, then xt developers would have to compensate.   In this sense you have two groups fighting for the hashpower.   The most obvious outcome, should both sides be persistent until the end, is that we will wind up with two cryptocurrency forks.  One being core, and one being xt.  Take what you can from that.
@_date: 2016-01-14 06:33:50
Enjoy your cake and eating it too.  If you are looking for a new argument for something that rivals on its integrity, then it is obvious that you have issues with integrity.  I like integrity.  You don't buy into the slippery slope argument.  This is a fundamental difference in philosophies.  Take your "mutable bitcoin" idea somewhere where it can actually be implemented.  You don't know what you are talking about, which is obvious.  Maybe you can practice running into brick walls until they convince you of something about integrity.

Thanks for the input, and I get why you down-voted me.  You may see it as hypocrisy, but I am not one who advocates the use of drugs and having a "free spirit" in conjunction with taking the role of transforming a global money market.  It was by his own words that the voting system was introduced as apart of the plan.  I was wondering if there was more details rather than just the dialogue on slack.  Also wondering why it appears that I am the only one this might concern.

Part of me misread that saying that you sold all your equipment.  But the notion that you've been mining since 2011 means that you've had FPGAs, skipped over BFL and chose Avalon's first batch, or/and maybe KNC's early shipment, and somehow still claim you are mining profitably even today is all kind of unbelievable to me.

Major development surrounding btc infrastructure is indication of growth which compliments the infrastructure that you call dead.  Don't you know people won't pay more for a btc transaction that they can get somewhere else?  The fact that btc is still being adopted is the opposite of dying.

I'm being censored right now, not by Theymos, but by bots and sockpuppets vote-manipulating.  has heavy moderation too, for anything that reflects bad light on classic.  It is the reddit incentive plan that is doing this.  Classic's traction on reddit would not exist if Mike Hearn's article wasn't released a day before the value of the Yuan made a huge gain.  There are a lot ifs.  The strength of BTC is most important in the public light.  If core was to give a 2mb block increase in response to people complaining, it would indicate the same fallible trait that governs today's failing fiat.  The best thing they can do, is to release a patch as a form of improvement; not as a fix.  To cave into social/economic threats would demonstrate the weakness that people buy into btc to avoid.  They probably need to wait until this rhetoric is dead, and "block limits didn't kill btc, afterall" realization is grasped.

I am aware of that, which makes classic's ability to kick in, in a way thats considered timely to the people demanding it, bittersweet.  At which point in the, btcs price will still increase and transaction fees prove themselves to not be a roadstop.   Core will have fulfilled their promises, possibly more.
 People are convinced that Mike Hearn's outing has a lot to do with the fluctuation of the price, but I see stronger correlation between the valuation of the yuan, and Hearn's piece was timed a day right before a huge spike of an increase of the yuan.  So I feel like a lot of feelings are misplaced, and people are looking for ways to be responsible for btcs value.

I would be careful of keeping btc on coinbase, because if a fork occurs and btc finds itself operating simultaneously with two different platforms, its an open opportunity for online ledgers to take advantage of the situation
In other words, keep your btc on an offline wallet.  If network becomes two networks then you have btc to spend on both.

I think that it's funny that Reddit is the source for the news that Reddit likes to post. This is an extension of the circle jerk, do you see?

If btc existed in a free market maybe it would have been programmed differently from the get-go.  You could easily say that the 21 million cap is artificial and that we could just turn bitcoin into a dogecoin.  But since dogecoin already exists, as well as other cryptocurrencies that fit the ideals you want to instill, you are already free to switch to them.
@_date: 2016-01-20 00:54:54
White paper was an outline of the idea, and the protocol is developed as it is the vision in action. To talk about how btc was a mistake and Satoshi did it wrong is kind of ridiculous.
The protocol put into place over four years ago had a 1 mb cap.  When asking "what happens when the blocks become full" the natural answer is "fee market develops".
It's not my fault that you have selective reading.
My only argument is not an argument.  It is simply an assertion that what the miners says, goes.  And this has been in place for a while now.  You are bargaining with something you can't budge.  If you were to shut up, start mining on classic, it would speak so much more.

Convincing?  How about appealing?  It may not appeal to you, but it doesn't make it not right or not work.  I like that btc doesn't change its rules and alienate its miners all the time.  You've had miners working for years, some without profit, supporting a system that has clearly indicated that even when new btc is no longer generated, the fee market that is generated will take its place in yielding proper reward to the miners.  Miners feed the network and the network feeds the miners.  Take away the btc reward, and miners will lose incentive/purpose.

The integrity that is BTC is important to uphold.  It may be inevitible that blocksizes increase, but then again they may not.
I remember, before buying miners...  I thought: what will make btc work after the blockrewards are gone, I really want to support something that is self-sufficient.  That's where the fee market comes in.  The fee market is ultimate proof that BTC is working.  If people will still use BTC and volunteer transaction fees, that means people actually support bitcoin.  The transaction fee, at its equilibrium, we determine the real world valuation that BTC has.

The idea was that the protocol that gains majority of the hashing power, gets providence.  The suggestion of implementing a voting system under that providence, would have the freedom to undo it, or at least render it more widely manipulable.  I am not saying bitcoin is a democracy.  I was trying to emphasize the redundancy and the risk that it introduces.

The "attack" that pays back the miners the most is the least kind of attack there is.  I would find such a thing as entertaining as well as an incredible waste on part of of the entity "attacking" in such a way.  For it to be useful, they would have to either have %51+ control already, or be in possession of so much btc that they just want to see what would happen.  Either way, I'm interested in such a test against the network.

A bump in blocksize that was not solicited by the miners is a compromise in favor of those who would rather benefit from the blockchain without contributing to it.  Please consider that.
The fee market that is developing is proof to the world that BTC's blockchain is worth something.
Segwit is the real golden egg in all of this current rhetoric.
@_date: 2016-01-09 01:51:34
%10 attack is happening because of democracy and a loud platform like Reddit.  A controversy is when it's 50/50.  Right now.  It's a growing pain.
I like most of what you said, but even with full blocks, btc won't stop working.  Competitive fee markets will keep miners relevant.  And it will encourage more holding as well.  Side chains can handle their own settlement layers for mass transactions if such a thing was truly demanded.
Nothing is wrong with BTC.  I personally would like it to carry an image of being a reliable protocol that doesn't change, because its rules have been predefined.
How would you like it if the 21 million cap was raised?
@_date: 2016-01-19 11:47:40
If blocks are not full, the pressure to volunteer fees disappears.  It's literally no extra work to process a full block vs an empty block.  What you are suggesting is in the same way of giving blockchain technology to the banks and having miners volunteer for them.

Over a year ago, there was a mass spam attack on reddit from many people saying that Bitcoin is broken in tandem with rally against core programmers, where both Ethereum supporters and were saying the same thing.  Since then, Ethereum broke and Bitcoin tripled in price.  tends to be a sub of premature celebration, fake support, and blatant opposition to the state of bitcoin--especially during bull runs.  If you look at all of this, it looks like the purpose of is to see bitcoin fail so that something else can succeed.  I don't doubt that things like BU are designed to trojan-horse hardforks into the protocol in order to monopolize the protocol for a minority.  There's no saying that they actually work... If you look at what happened with the DAO and Ethereum, I am surprised that anyone would put confidence in a protocol overhaul, just so they can monopolize the legacy of the main chain.   There are so many other cryptocurrencies, but they want their cake and eat it too.

A transaction may be safely sent without fees if these conditions are met:
It is smaller than 1,000 bytes.
All outputs are 0.01 BTC or larger.

Who says they can change anything?  The traction required to implement new changes require trust and manual installation by the people who actually secure the network:  miners.  And beyond that, there has to be a consensus about it between the network of at least %50 the resources (Currently: 866,681,209 GH/s) before it starts changing.
Out of all contending protocols, it is easiest for the Dev. group of BTC core to instigate change, because they have a trackrecord of being beneficial to the network.  Their code is opensource and available to the public to scrutinize every day of the week; which is a big reason why we are even able to debate block size at all.  However, it is very likely that if something malicious did reach code, it would be discovered before consensus was ever reached.
Theymos is the moderator of this sub.  He has been involved in BTC since its infancy.  His view is that whatever protocol is held by the consensus of the miners, which is currently core, is the established bitcoin, and therefore any influence to deviate hashrate away from it is malicious.  
This "censorship" or "moderation" of this aspect has helped lead to villianizing Theymos, but that doesn't mean he doesn't allow you to insult and criticize his character on his own sub.
I personally like core.  I personally disliked Theymos' passive beneficiary role with BFL.  That is my bias.
@_date: 2016-01-17 02:40:29
You guys have to implement it first.  Like release it and let the proof of work be the final say.  Organizing charts based on twitter feeds isn't enough.  Get the miners hashing for your client.  Let your altcoin become the new btc.  Then talk about your success here.
@_date: 2016-01-19 06:39:42
But that is happening, as long as you aren't trying to fuck over the ones who are trying to make it happen.  Protesting to raise block limits or hosting a coup does not make anything easier for the grandma EU.  Segwit is an effort to make BTC more efficient, while there's a bunch of buttcoiner turned btc investors screaming "it's not growing fast enough!"
@_date: 2016-01-21 06:12:00
You do know that a coup is when you attempt to remove someone out of power, right?  It's kind of hard for core to replace core, as it is.  So if you are mad about core's position in the protocol, do something about it.  I suggest you start mining.

You are confusing the stakeholders of btc with the vocal of Reddit.  The stakeholders are the miners.  Not people who say they mine, but what miners do.  That is consensus.  The vision is happening and the blockchain is introducing a paradigm shift.  If Reddit becomes decentralized in a similar fashion, it could become a part of the blockchain, or a competing one.  You can establish a blockchain/sidechain  that works with the established one or start from scratch.  It's already apparant that your interest is in the blockchain, but you are having fundamental issues with understanding what it is.  
It's not a personal attack to say that you are a buttcoiner when your argument and rhetoric is against what btc actually is.  It's not a surprise that buttcoiners mysteriously "vanish" as people start appearing as if they are for btc by arguing against it.  That's just one of the 12 steps: bargaining.
Btc can be easily changed in so many ways.  But not by lack of mining, so you are fighting for social controls that do not exist.
The white paper is not a program or a protocol, but the outline for the protocol, as it was established.  Of course the tree is not the fruit and vice versa, but they are apart of the same organism.
@_date: 2016-01-19 11:57:06
Are you a puppet account?  You are the second person who referred to the blocksize as "artificial".  The 21 million cap is just as " artificial ".  Long-term sustainability gives value to bitcoin's short game.  To pretend that is an issue we can address later alienates many investors who considered the long-term protocol before investing.  It's so easy to change the protocol, so why not do it?  Simple, because btc isn't all about you.

A lot of people confuse "consensus" as meaning,"If I agree with the apparent vocal majority", but in that sense, you can just watch fox news and "be free of controversy", right?
Consensus, for BTC is down to the miners and the work that they do.  Everything else is an attempt to reshape consensus.  I don't mind arguing.  In fact, I love it.  When I first started bitcoin mining, I wanted to be sure that the model that was in place was self-sufficient.  I wondered what would happen as the rewards shrank.  What would keep the miners online?  Seeing that btc was coded so that in the event that blocks do become full, a fee market would develop.  This, in my mind, was redemption, and the fact that it is happening means that BTC is successful.  Maybe too successful?
Nobody will pay more than it is worth to them to send a transaction over BTC, but some people will and do pay more than others.  That means that there is both room and incentive for a growing demand in btc, especially considering that nothing in the world of fiat is actually dependent on it.
Prices will shift back and forth.  When the value of btc decreases, the fees don't seem as much.  As the value of btc increases, the fees seem like more.  The train is constantly shifting because this is an exploratory art form that is trying to establish equilibrium amidst chaos.  I feel like a lot of the shock from Mt. Gox is still being experienced.  The crazy valuation of $1200 a btc is just mythical, yet somehow, it is still being recorded as valid btc history.  The more that this system is tested, the closer we can get to a real term of valuation, which can be enriched.

They say:  "oh it's only one part in the code we need to change".  Weeks later, they are like "of course we need to change a lot of code to adapt to the conversion trigger".  Weeks after that, they are like "leave us alone, we are too busy taking cock in the ass."

I am not quoting a solution.  That is the best reference point I have on toomim.  The original source I had was the slack conversation when he is high on drugs and being a "free spirit" on the subject of protocol overhaul.  
I think the best thing is to let all the incentives balance out.  I'm okay with leaving things as they are for a while, before attempting to fine-tune it.  I don't think changes being made in reaction to market or social pressure is healthy for a stable currency.

We get assholes brigading like it's their business to correct something that they joined in on.  If you think you can Rob miners of their incentive so that you could say that btc is like visa, then yes, it is already a slippery slope.  You don't want to acknowledge it simply because it doesn't suit you.  The generation of assholes that come after you will say "oooh, its because of the hardcap of 21 million that people aren't getting involved with BTC fast enough".  And then they will follow your example, should it prove victorious.  Good luck.  I'm not buying or selling until I can doublespend on your fork and legacy fork.  Trust me, it will divide.
@_date: 2016-01-20 06:36:59
"Almost all transactions are free."  At the time, this was correct because the protocol wasn't in demand.
He later says "I agree.  All transactions, IP changes, renewals, etc. should have some fee that goes to the miners."
It is important to follow how development led to where it is now, instead of choosing parts of the bible that you agree with and inventing your own religion.  You have to convince the whole mass now.  In order to do that, you would have to be the second coming of satoshi.  Good luck.

That is a possible outcome.  Another possible outcome is that classic tries to compete with core for a very long time.  So long, that an equilibrium or trend is found between btc price and fees.  So long that core realizes its roadmap, and nothing consequential happens of classic, other than people filling the awkward silence.

I truly believe Toomim is a clown.  If there was such thing as democracy supporting btc, it is the miners and the manner in which they behave.

Miners are the first user of btc.  In the sense you are putting it, everyone else is a proxy for the person after them.  I understand that if people don't want to pay 5 cents to pay for coffee, that they won't.  But that doesn't mean that they wouldn't wire 5,000K for five cents using the same network.  I think it is important to see the stabilization between the network's fee market and what people are willing to pay for bitcoin.  I think, as it is already, btc has potential for unlimited growth; albeit slower than what those proposing immediate higher blocks want to see.  Either way, it is going to be information to the world that wouldn't be readily visible in any other way known to man.

I'm sorry, the function of bitcoin is not to meet your personal terms of valuation.  It is working as intended.  Mike Hearn says transaction fees are rising fast, did he?  Do you know what that means and if that's true?  
This is bitcoin, as a protocol, working.  As long as people are "trusting experts" and not understanding the rules that are in place; this is a big growing pain where people are going to regret not being technically inclined. 
If you send a transaction and offer a 30 cent fee, your transaction will jump ahead of all the free transactions, which is 90% of the noise which is filling the blocks.  Hell, make it 2 cents.  You can see for yourself.

Okay, thanks.  I need to grab a point of reference and express my sentiment more clearly.  
There is a slack dialogue where jtoomim tells his plan of introducing a user-based voting layer in the protocol that would give authority to the voting base to change how btc operates.
That would open btc up to all kinds of voting manipulation, that reddit already sees.  People could possibly vote for btc to self-destruct, simply because they do not like it.
@_date: 2016-01-25 05:20:48

Bitcoin doesn't need to scale, no matter what.  It's not going to stop working because people will have to get competive by offering a minimal transaction fee to jump in front of line of the 90% of spam transactions that offer no transaction fees. Thousands of .0001 transactions are being processed with no fees associated with them, and people think we have a scaling problem.  In two years we could do 2mb, and still see consistent adoption.
@_date: 2016-01-19 06:26:31
5 cents for a gumball.  5 cents for all the gumballs.
[As you can see here]( the going rate of .000136 of the most immediate/optimal transaction has not changed in over 4 days (I suppose it has gone up and down, but I have been always ok with paying .0001 a transaction).  The junk filling the blocks are just cheapskates, or people using the network for microtransactions and paying close to no fee.  Of course that's from a miner's perspective who is also interested in seeing the system as self-sufficient.
@_date: 2016-01-18 12:13:33
Well a miner might not be able to process their own tx fee.  They risk forfeiture.
@_date: 2016-01-19 07:36:27
All of btc came, initially, through block rewards, meaning that miners are the first to obtain btc before anyone else.  It's not about whether or not people agree with me.  This is just how the network is established.  It is as block rewards dwindle towards nothing that the fee market developing continues to sustain incentive for the miners to keep working.  Continually raising the block size, as use increases, ultimately shorts miners of btc in the long term.  People refusing to pay fees are not rewarding miners btc.  BTC, as it was designed, used block rewards as initial forms of funding; where the fee market that develops afterward would be the sustaining incentive/force for miners to keep going.  Of course, it is the same reason BTC became useful at all, that fee markets are established and remain, despite outcries on reddit that do not understand otherwise.  The fee market is the only reliable terms of valuation that miners have in comparison to their banker counterparts.  The war is between banks and miners.  Everyone else is getting caught up in between.

That would only work if miners are working together by a centralizing force that is not born of the protocol.  That would create incentive for a single mining entity.
@_date: 2016-01-31 02:10:57
Decentralization and consensus apply mostly to miners.  If you have never mined then those words probably don't mean a lot to you.  However, mining is what makes btc secure, and consensus is established in the way that miners of different users play by the same rules.  It is paradoxical because it is like btc is a centralized decentralization.  Or a decentralized centralization.
@_date: 2017-03-25 12:35:38
Why do you use the word "artificially" on the blocksize cap and not on bitcoin or any other aspect about it?

I am not saying what should or should not be done.  Either way, ethereum will survive.  If a change to nullify the DAO can be made, then it is by the network following rules of its governance which is already in place.

It's actually comparable in the way that I compared it.  If the Mt Gox incident occurred over one contract, as opposed to many transactions over the course of many years, I personally feel that bitcoin would have had more success in public image if a hot fix was proposed.  Just because a community can band together to service an isolated exploit (which "shouldn't exist") does not mean that it is not, at all, decentralized, or doing something that is against rules.

@_date: 2016-06-18 00:25:40
The publication was misleading if you insist that it is doing as intended.  As Ethereum is in beta and the DAO was also his attempt to show a proof of work, there is this as a possible outcome.  The contract may be working as intended, but if the consensus turns out that it was misleading, then it can be overturned by a majority.  Would this be a detriment to smart contracts on Ethereum, or would it be a feature and a potential possibility down the line?
@_date: 2016-06-25 22:30:21

Who determines what is fundamental, if not consensus?  Basically, I am saying if ethereum adopts the change, then it distinguishes Ethereum even more apart from bitcoin.  I'm in favor of that.  The variety will contribute to the collective understanding of cryptocurrency as a whole.  What's fundamental is what is done.  This isn't about morality as much as it is about action, or the lack thereof.
Also, contract does exist on Ethereum's domain, so Ethereum consensus is the authority.  If the Mt Gox incident happened in one transaction, maybe this dilemma would have been observed already.
@_date: 2016-06-22 12:47:05
Your transaction size was 6 times the median.  Probably because you have many inputs/outputs. You can reconsolidate ahead of time if you are generally time sensitive and do not like paying higher fees.  Cointape.com is a great resource if your interested in some education on the fee schedule.
@_date: 2016-06-26 12:37:27

If "The DAO" is a smart contract, and consensus of Ethereum protocol can overrule it, then you have both factors to account for.  You are arguing ethics and what "should be" to someone who is pointing out what is possible and some potential outcomes.  Just as consensus can "fix" btc or force btc into bigger blocks, consensus can nullify a giant smart-contract.  Decentralized does not mean unchangeable.

Lol, quiet, you!
@_date: 2016-06-26 14:10:27
Not true.  That is the kind of arrogance that got the DAO in trouble in the first place.  Just because we assume that only two specific parties are privy to administrative privileges does not mean that there is no opportunity someone to trigger false flags in order to dupe the system.  We still don't know if bitcoin can be hacked.  One might say that the big blocks vs small blocks "debate" is a socialized hack to weaken it.
@_date: 2016-06-17 22:31:24
The exploit is on Ethereum's domain making the consensus of Ethereum the authority.  "Should" or "should not" is a moral dilemma that miners and developers will weigh in.  In terms of public image, this can go either direction.  However, seeing how VB has responded and assuming that trajectory carries, it is possible that Ethereum may be seen with new appeal.

The contract is not working as intended or as advertised.  Fixing that might be a good idea for the crypto as a whole.  If the whole of the ETH community supports this decision, isn't that a part of decentralization that enables voting?  Maybe you didn't know, but bitcoin had to fork in the past because of a similar reason.  Millions of bitcoin being made because of a coding problem.  This isn't  about sending someone to jail.
If the gox incident could have been as easily fixed, I believe it would have been patched out.
@_date: 2016-01-19 12:12:33
You are the second person who referred to the blocksize as "artificial". The 21 million cap is just as " artificial ". Long-term sustainability gives value to bitcoin's short game. To pretend that is an issue we can address later alienates many investors who considered the long-term protocol before investing. It's so easy to change the protocol, so why not do it? Simple, because btc isn't all about you. Are you a puppet account?

Consensus is the real point here.   If the majority didn't adopt the new fork, you wouldn't be making a case. You can argue about what's right or wrong.  I don't think your example is as similar as it is to the DAO situation.  A closer example would to be if Mt. Gox received everyone's money under one address, never allowed anyone to trade, and then succumbed to robbery.  Then core proposed a hot-patch.
However, after all the mixing and ponzi acts, it had become severely complicated.  The possibility to rollback or hot-patch the protocol would never enter the picture.  Bitcoin is a lot less complicated in what scenarios may propose a fork.
@_date: 2016-06-17 22:00:33
With ethereum you have contracts which act as an extension of the protocol.  Calling it a bailout misses the idea of what's actually happening.  A nullification of the contract through consensus of the miners and developers does not put more ethereum into circulation nor pays an assumed debt.  Of course ethereum is not "personally" liable, but if ethereum helps, then that can reflect well.
@_date: 2016-06-18 02:30:26
My perspective is that bitcoin is superior and more grounded, and that ethereum is still in development alongside it's capacity to deploy efficient contracts.  I'm not fully aware of the proposed solution but from what I understand is that the soft fork wouldn't be a rollback affecting other transactions created up until now.  It would be a hot fix that would render the DAO address incapacitated.  Considering ethereum decentralization is still small and leadership is still prevalent, it is definitely possible for this to happen.  I am not arguing that it is an improvement or a detriment.  Obviously, that is a divided perspective.  One can argue all kinds of points, but the point I am making is that consensus has final say, and the project will continue whether you agree or not.

There is a degree of decentralization with the mining and deployment outfit, but a large influence by a present core developer.  Imagine how different bitcoin would be if Satoshi was still talking.

Well Reddit isn't that old.  I was satisfied with bitcoin as a protocol, not holding the expectation for it to become what is not.  If you only use btc for what it might become, then I am very confused as to how you get any value out of it at all.
The problem with Reddit is that people can come onto here and make false posts about how a company sold them a box with no hardware inside it, and the company is socially pressured to "correct" the problem.  I feel like this is what is happening about core.  These reddit "users" of btc aren't reporting real world issues that they are having with BTC.  They are only acting as overly concerned "stock-holders" and being rather dramatic about it, while raising fud about how core developers have a monopoly, and suggesting that the miners are simply pawns.

Toomin's ridiculous out of touch idea of making btc more like Reddit governance is out in the open.  So is the fact that he is more interested in drugs than what is consensus.  Btc is a perfect alternative to the banking system, as it is.  It doesn't need a divided community over "how to make it more perfect than it is".  The people are bored with their own lives and want a way to feel more important.  Either they are impatient, spoiled, or both.  People who invested btc not for what it is, but for what if might become are not honorable by default.  I would have more respect for them if they started a %51 attack without this rhetoric trying to appeal to emotion.  It is obvious that they do not believe that the code should speak for itself.

Prior to this protocol definition struggle, consensus had always been what miners agree on in order to make btc function.  I feel like a bunch of jerks are hijacking the word "consensus" to mean what they want people to start adopting, ie:  many people tweet and Reddit that they want "b" so "b must be consensus".  It's a false rhetoric. " b" is not consensus if "a" is what the miner network upholds. 
Decentralization, has been about the miners too, as the hashing should be dispersed as well as it can.  More people should be involved in mining, but because of the scarcity and involvement of asic miner hardware, there are now miner owners who become the equivalent of btc bankers.
With btc's function, it has always been about the miners consensus.  But lately the Reddit+ community has been saying that btc has been a product of core and that the miners are helpless.  That's just a tactic to encourage division in the community.  Btc is btc.  If you don't like it, then make a protocol that fits your definition; try to sell the idea on and when you get banned for encouraging a majority attack on the btc network, then you can call theymos dictator of bitcoin.
Sounds about where we are.

Propaganda is when you call someone a racist for talking about Mexico sending "their" rapists to the US, when you call someone a sexual assaulter for talking about grabbing pussy. However, when you leak actual proofs of what someone IS doing/saying; that itself is not propaganda. May this benefit a Russia and a Trump America; maybe. Really, the leaks look bad because they are of bad things. Reporting criminals should not be treated as a criminal act. If you violate privacy laws in order to reveal murderers, I feel like the end justifies leniency on the prosecution of the primary act of violating privacy. We all would rather be saving lives than saving lies. Trump is definitely not clean. He probably uses bribary to his own end. But, in my mind, that is a less of a crime than creating, funding, and arming a terrorist group and then exploiting their actions for political/financial gain. 
If you want the Soro's "dream" to come true, just keep on being cattle. I am not going to fight you over it. I will argue, though. Assange revealed a bit on Bush and Cheney, too. He is obviously against an America that wants to rule and control people by propaganda.

Once it is installed.  But the emphasis is prevention, not detect-ability, necessarily.  That's the key point as to why you do not want to run any executable you cannot trust.  These are contracts that you are executing, and you don't want to execute a contract that you cannot account for.  Even the way some videos and images are designed, can make system calls via the software you use to open them.  Even though it's not perfect, it's a reason why I like VLC over Windows media player.

When I decide to experiment, I allow room for potential catastrophe.  I have a laptop that I'll allow myself more liberty with if I want to get curious about something.  (Very rare these days)  But typically, whenever I try to download a picture, pdf, or any other thing, and get an executable instead... it's painfully obvious that it isn't what I was looking for.  
Generally I just don't download from sources that I do not trust.  When I get my operating system set up for the first time, I already know what browsers I'll install, what media players I'll install, what viewers/editors, what games (if any) I'll install, and from who...   
These days viruses aren't so popular.  Because of the prevalence of AV software, most scammers make executables that get proper permission before spying on/soliciting you.  It's either that or webpages with embedded script, which AV still won't protect against.
The size of the safety net, that is AV, is a lot smaller than it was 5-10 years ago.  Most bloatware/spyware come in the form of fake AV, toolbars, screensavers, or webscripts which will register as legit or bypass completely, which is why "internet security" is a thing.  The only time a "virus" is ever triggered, for me, is when it is overwriting something to bypass a security check I do not want.  (DRM ;) )
As a rule of thumb, I use 2-tier authentication and have an image of my OS drive backed up.
I like being fully accountable, things like safety nets do not work for me.  Especially when you can't see them or they compromise the integrity of the system.

(BTC ransom, false advertisements, loop scripts locking your browser accessl)  You don't want to run any executable without knowing its intention.  But you don't have to have an AV system that runs 24/7 when you aren't changing anything about your computer.  If you ever experimented on a system with AV vs a system with no AV.. the difference in how fast it is, is amazing.  I haven't caught a virus since I almost infected my school's system in 2001.  Even then, it was a false positive.
I'll scan once in a while, just to make sure I'm still on top of my game.
You can literally have a 100 virused files on your computer, but as long as you don't execute them, they will not have permission to operate.
I believe AVG has been found to be collecting information on its users.  That's why it was free.

Not what I was saying, but that's a good point.
I figure anything that is contrary, is considered as garbage either way, to the party that it disagrees with.
But shit makes the grass greener.  I love that I was downvoted, anyway.  Reddit is a giant complicated faggot.  Fuck ya'll.  Democracy is another religion.

Yeah, fucks supply and demand (the version taught in schools) right up the ass!

Yes, but the spam will take super long for anyone to see it.  And it won't be all at once either.  
That spam, may one day become the building blocks of something greater.  Like a website or service hosted by the blockchain, using BTC as a motor.

Bitcoin is "consumable" in the sense you just have to rely on people to regurgitate it in order to stay alive.  (Or mine it, but even that will end up relying on network fees in the use of it)  In broader terms, bitcoin isn't lost.  It will just take a long time before the code is "found" again.
Also, let's not forget that wheat in 2010 was not as popular as it was in 2012 because it was before the switching from corn product to the wheat product due to foodies and "organics" impact on society.
Also, wheat shows a dramatic increase, after both instances of scarcity; just like everything.

ASIC, as units, have their own firmware, usually.  So whatever is programmed already, is typically what you've got to deal with.

Also, I forgot to mention that Reddit emphasizes fag culture with it's karma system and advertisers are the ones that win.  You all are pussies.

Umm..  Using AV generally requires the processor to work twice as hard.  As long as you aren't "discovering" the internet, you'd generally know how to handle potential threats on a per-basis.  AV won't even protect the harm you can inflict on yourself from the unlimited scam systems that are out there.
Also, AV is spyware too.

I get annoyed with anything that persistently monitor all my actions (I notice lag with any program, and I can say so about Eset already).  I'm already being monitored by MS, Google, and whoever else.  Maybe if my life is jeopardized by something I did with a computer, I could just have the government get the information on the perpetrators from them or themselves.  I'm not one to put all my life into a computer though.  Anything that MS does will not be flagged as a virus or harmful.  And MS has the ability to sell their access out to other companies.  So as far as security goes, AV is a security blanket.

No.  I was just explaining why the so-called bullshit wasn't actually bullshit.  Some people value the feeling of being safe vs. knowing what safety is.  Do you really care about my associates?  Because I can tell you don't care for me by the way you are plainly ignoring what I did say.
AV can't 100% protect you so don't put all your eggs in one basket, fool.

I don't know how to solo mine.  If I did, I would be operating my own node and doing it despite anticipated losses over electricity.
I have an asic miner.  If someone can point out how to exactly I could do this, and a method of checking to make sure it's working properly; I'll be all over that.
The idea of playing the lottery is more fun than joining a pool.

Egon fees like throwing nickels away on a network is a luxury and not an obligation.  Perhaps he doesn't pay for his own internet connection.

"This sounds like a "no true scotsman" fallacy."
Sounds like, but is not.  If you read every word, in context, it is saying "if you trust a purely centralized form of ledger tracking, then you should not hesitate to rely on a decentralized system".  Your parables make no sense.  Also, the decentralized system is more paradoxical than you'd like to admit.  Decentralized bitcoin is also centralized in function via protocol consensus.

It's amusing that certain big block HF supporters see this as FUD, as if it might ruin something they've built.
