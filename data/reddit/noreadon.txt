too many MBAs are flipping burgers now, they are too many. Having an interest in bitcoin does not mean you have chance to enter the competitive market. If you were a hard-core developers, it would be different.

The basic thing about cryptocurency is its decentralize characteristic and it does not fucking need any type of license or regulations. Now, forcing a company to not be able to keep its retained earnings/profits in cryptocurrency but have to convert all into US Dollar. What a fucking cunt dictatorship! Petrodollar is a stinky dick and you try dragging all to the mug with this dysfunctional dick. You cannot even prevent Lehman Brother collapse, oh wait, you were busy with strippers and yachts. Requiring all who associate with cryptocurrency to apply for license, have biographical information, scan background, etc. Holy fuck how this world has become. Bitcoin is not and will not under this shitty regulation, it is not Wall st for you to ride on.

The program is bullshit itself. Why need certified? Look at IT certifications, dumps everywhere on the net. I guess involved dudes behind this are just following the certification hype to get some bucks. My 2 cents.

it means nothing. It is just a polite answer.

it is bullshit. Satoshi created only one bitcoin version, no male nor female bitcoin version. I am extremely uncomfortable when seeing titles like this which put the gender element as the main argument. Really? There is no teen boy with title "I'm a teenage boy that uses bitcoin AMA." I am not against you lady but ...

you sound pathetic. 2 months down is nothing, it used to be down horribly.

I got same message twice when I purchased at the price of 5xx and next three days price was like 7xx. I was supposed to make profit of xxxx but they cancelled delivering. Yea, it is unpredictable as  said.

Satoshi Nakamoto is the man who really built bitcoin. Only Satoshi.
