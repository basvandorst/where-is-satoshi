Yes, the purpose of posts like this is to bamboozle people into propping up the price with their life savings while somebody else reaps the profits.

Finally someone is banking the unbanked!

Very good, but you should finish by pulling down your pants and taking a shit on the living room rug while screaming "And this is how bitcoin solves the clogged toilet of the economy! Take that, statists!"

Why would the miners agree to that? They decide which transactions go through.

Jesus, at least think for a second before you post.

Huh? This is exactly what the sellers are doing. Taking profits while everyone else is left holding the bag.

Yes, let's pretend bitcoin is as useful as VCR.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:24:00
That's silly, all altcoins are bitcoins

Untrue, the worlds best developers, scientists, mathematicians, etc either don't give a fuck about bitcoin or discreetly laugh at it.

This is a dumb point to make when it's obvious that the innovator in question is actually trying to make the world worse without realizing this.

Every last bit of that hydro power should be used to replace the coal plants instead of wasting it to mine bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:01:17
Not really, that's why we have power grids in the first place.

The math says the Wall Street traders will clean up the ideological amateur investors as usual.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:56:14
This same argument applies to coal plants you dingus
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:35:17
So you're saying it's a good idea?
