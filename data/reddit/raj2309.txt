My problem with that statement is "if it works!". What do they mean if it works? There are business using ln on mainnet. There's 196 ln nodes with 525 payment channel opened with 2.89 btc cap (at the time of writing). More ln nodes and channel will be open. It's works! Yes agree it's not production ready! Yes there's still more works to be done in order to be mass adopted. but LN is already working!

Everyday new nodes and new channels been established. Even it's not production ready yet. People willing to take the risk to be the guinea pig to test on real world scenario. This is good! Exciting!

I think people are unaware that they are overpaying. Most rely on fee estimation. Is estimation suggesting high fees?

Well Roger mock him that he would have been a millionaire by now if he bought $300 worth of bitcoins around 6 years ago. There's a post by him where he made bad financial decisions n really on paycheck to paycheck. But never deterred his aim on educating new users about Bitcoin, preaching bitcoin, accepting conference n travel on his own expense. it's glad that now community comes together n help the guy.

When you do good to others, others will do good to you. Just saw the perfect example here. He's the reason I got into bitcoin and it sucks to find out what he gone thru and despite that, he spend his time educating new users, talking about this in various avenues and contributing a lot for the community. He truly believed that this will change everything and make all of us a believer.
Now it's time for us to take care of him and his family.
