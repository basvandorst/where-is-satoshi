Healthier not to watch the price that often.

My Nicehash internal wallet starts with a 3. If I send Bitcoin from that address to my Segwit wallet in my Nano S, that will be a Segwit transaction, yes?
@_date: 2018-01-14 02:27:22
So an address starting with 3 is SegWit, isn't it? So by that reasoning, Nicehash uses SegWit.

Actually, it doesn’t crash when people sell, it crashes when people *ask* to sell. The price can plummet like a streamlined anvil when people ask the price down, in the same way as people bid the price up, with few or any trades actually needing to take place.

You might not realise there are different grades of nurses. Some (registered nurses)  have a university degree, in a course that only requires about 50%GPA to get into. Others (enrolled nurses) only have a trade certificate.
So yes, compared to must other professions they are quite uneducated. 
That isn't the same as intelligence though. 
I know and have known some really smart nurses whom I work with daily. I also work with some that are as thick as two planks (and who are regarded as such by the former nurses I mentioned).
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:03:26
Yeah I went off on a tangent there but I am also hearing it from people in theatres with really quite low education, which includes nurses.

Small dips are called retracements.

The lady who cuts my hair owns three salons and real estate, so yes.

You might be surprised. 
I'm still going to hodl, but I have had operating theatre nurses asking how they can buy BTC and ask what it is and "Can I make money from it?"
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:36:33
I’m not brushing it away. I am hodling. I have missed too many crypto boats since 2011 (when I first heard about BTC and it was selling for $1.50) to sell now. I even sold 3BTC in Sep 2016 at $500 each :(
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:39:03
Yes  everything is as easy as the next thing.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:35:23
Your clients keep asking you? When hairdressers and taxi drivers are saying “buy”, that’s usually a sell signal.

And she's also an operating theatre nurse.

The point was that people who generally have no idea about a tradable asset or security, or exchange token in this case, are talking about it, which contributes to a price bubble. Nothing to do with those jobs in particular.
And you knew that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:57:42
Yes. But I sold out recently as BCH was shooting up after the Coinbase launch. So now I am considering buying back in. I wouldn't suffer a net loss as I made gains on the BCH rally.

You didn't actually read the above comment, did you?

Bitcoin God? I got my BTG and sold that already.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:10:44
Yes indeed. But I cannot subscribe to the notion that all degrees are of equal difficulty.
@_date: 2018-10-15 22:39:45
That looks very distracting from driving.

Yep. On the subject of loose crypto change lying around. I have solar panels on the roof and a large monthly data limit on home internet, so I downloaded the entire Namecoin Blockchain into the OS X Qt client, just so I could retrieve 13.85 NMC (as I couldn't find a soft wallet that would sweep/import my private backup key).  So now I have my $30 worth of Namecoin back. 
I would have a look for stray Litecoin fragments, but wemineltc is now defunct.

My first bitcoin purchase was a bit less interesting: a subscription to the Brave browser.

Ledger wallet was pretty quick to support BCH and if another coin arises out of the next few months' turmoil, I would think they, and other major wallets, would also work to do so. Jaxx, for instance, doesn't support BCH yet, but is keeping users updated on their progress towards supporting it. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:46:22
All depends on how news spreads. If people believe Bitcoin core will die, they may flee like rats from a sinking ship. But the promise of getting some free coins first and then fleeing would also be attractive. I might have to take up smoking to get through this. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 11:39:53
I used to have a full node wallet three years ago when the Blockchain was only 7GB. I don't have much tolerance to download the whole thing again, unless I can find a torrent of a bootstrap download. 
And to think I had a wallet when it only took a couple of hours to sync a new wallet and they even gave me 100mBit to start me off. I didn't buy any then, as MTGOX was unbanked and I could only get $ through via the now seized Liberty Fund based in Liberia. I should have taken the chance. They were selling for US$1.00.

I took my coins off exchanges and held them in Blockchain.info and then go into an argument with them about not letting me access my BCH. It was like a bank having a policy of "no withdrawals".  So I got into GitHub and found electron-cash and got at it that way using the BIP39 seed. 
So now I guess the key now is to have a wallet with a BIP39 or 41 seed in case I need to do that again. But I although I am not inclined keep them on an exchange, things might be more difficult as they were at the beginning of the month, when I watched the price of BCH slide as I first worked to code a Linux machine to get the BCH, then waited over 36 hours for 20 confirmations on Bittrex.

Technical question from a non-technical person. Does this segregated witness have any bearing on segwit 2x in November? This uncertainty is killing me. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:10:33
BS. And if not fake, then the private key's encryption would take centuries to crack. 
Do you even Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-10-21 01:21:05
Way to overheat and drain the battery of a phone. Why anyone would want to run a node on a mobile beats me. 
The part about exchanges is bullshit.

Capital gains tax at the maximum rate in my country (Australia) but it would be less in the USA.
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:09:37
Most countries demand tax on crypto sales.
@_date: 2019-06-30 10:49:17
Yes, in most countries.
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:33:51
Selling in spike and re-buying the dip also generates a Capital Gains Tax event.
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:07:44
I don’t live in the USA.

45milibits? Good to see that prices have come down. Last I heard someone buy pizza with Bitcoin they paid 1000BTC ;)
@_date: 2019-06-28 07:13:18
It’s the perception that people can move out of then into a different position without a care for tax implications. If you bought Bitcoin in early 2016 for USD$200 then sold it last week at $15,000, then used the capital gain without putting up to $7000 aside in taxes to buy back in at $12,000, then you’re not that well off since you cannot claim a deduction for the spend on the new position. 
Better to HODL until you need the money and pay tax once. On and off ramps to crypto are monitored by regulatory authorities and you will get caught.

He got thrown off the red keep so there’s that.
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:42:34
How do they sell if no-one is buying? 
The price can also change with vastly reduced transactional velocity. It gets asked down as easily as it can be bidded up
