Question from Korea. Is it really $3.4M according to the exchange rate price? Is there a premium (like 10~20%) compared to paying in dollars? Really curious.

This didn't even make the news here in Korea. This company is  Coopang) in Korea, but the gap is huge. Also they are pulling every trick in the box to overcome the gap, and this looks like just one of them. Thanks for sharing, but every just bypassed this news in Korea.

Thanks, really in Seoul Korea, so inconvenient for me to call them! So they cashed out, interesting. More for a quick exit, so cash would have been preferrable for them. I wished they  would have held on the BTC, and that would have been big big news. Looking really dim in Korea, the market is dead right now. The premium went as high as 60%, now to 5%. Thanks and keep in touch.

Remember that back in those days, agriculture was considered "high-tech". Beautiful tulip was a result of at that time "output of the best minds". Also, they were pricing tulips which were to-be delivered next year, which pumped up the price. We consider "tulip bubble" so silly, but there is some common ground between the two. Let's not get too frustrated that analogy keeps coming up and up.

In Korea, and just to give you an idea what the market looks like:
1) Korean goverment is doing all it can to get the money back into the stock market. Samsung Electronics, the KING of Korean stock exchange, just annonced stock split of 50:1, a non precedented act. The funny thing is CEO is IN JAIL, and something like this IS NOT POSSIBLE, and they pulled it off. 
2) So what this means, they are going to the carrot mode much more now, since "shut off" all trading-ish threat does not work nor make sense. Going forward, it is more carrot, nudging NOT to invest in crypto but stock instead.
3) Regarding new investment, from yesterday, they allowed NEW accounts to be openned, But still in the transtion period, not in sync with the Gov-banks yet. 
4) But I think the Koreans will not drive the market like before, for they were mostly in fore the altcoin boom, which is almost dead now.

You've got a point. We'll see how this carries out. Japanese are more conservative by nature(even making bank deposits at minus interest reate), but their adaptation in crypto is much faster. Koreans are just in for the quick money, that's what deviated the market to 10,000 to 20,000 and back to now 11,500. It's mostly Korean hot mony going in and out, taging along other short term money. I will udpate on the landscape of Korea often. Keep in touch.

You're right on. Andrea Anopolous said the same thing. "All the countries must act together. Do that for global warming first! Not possible".

Loved Roubini and Peter Schiff right after the subprime crash, but their frame of logic just keeps remained in the box. Whenever the great minds of today say "it is NOT a currency", please visit Japan and Korea in the next 12 months. In Japan IT IS a currency, followed by Korea quickly catching up. Everything Japan does, Korea catches up soon. BTW, I just heard that Korean government entity is looking into setting up a crypto exchange, so "shutting down" is now completely out, and they will the crypto trading into its wings.

Yup their strategy totally changed. Korea, there is election for the governors coming up, and the millenium kids who lost 70~80% of their investment is threatning to "dethrone" anyone who "bans" crytpo, which is not a sustainable policy. They are putting all effort to "nudge" into bying stocks, instead of crypto. So, no banning nor any kind of "big threats" will not pop up. More soft carrots of money transfer from crypto-&gt;stock is the main policy right now. HOWEVER, the market is dead right now, the millininum kids who pumped BTC to 20,000 has all their money at ATH, so everyone around me has at least -50% next to their account. Short term pump from Korea not possible in the short run. Hope Japan, China picks up the slack to get out of this bear.
