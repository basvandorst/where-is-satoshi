Yes a standard on the Bitcoin network, but not mandatory.  That is kind of a deal breaker if I want to use it as a tipping app.  If I want to tip 100 bits, the tx fee is 50%.  You should be able to configure the transaction fee in a settings window.  100 bit tx fee is fine for larger amounts where the tx period is an issue.  If I am tipping someone a nickel, I don't really care about a fast transaction. 
Just a nit, you are using a "Settings" icon for a menu tab.
Also, you should check out the open source HTML5 bitcoin wallet on github, which uses the Scan Code app for native bar code reading on the iPhone.

I have a shit ton of BTC stuck, probably lost on Mt.Gox (yes, me stupid).  However, I lucked out on a fiat wire.
The Thursday before the shutdown, I wired fiat from Chase to Gox (yes, me dum dum stupid), which didn't show on my account Monday night.  Then Gox went down that evening and the next day I asked Chase to reverse the wire, which is basically a request by Chase to Mitsui.  By Friday that week, still no word from Mitsui, but the following Monday, the wire was reversed.
Dodged that bullet.
You might have a good chance, talk to your bank to reverse the wire.  I think Mitsui stopped taking wires close to before MtGox went dark.

How so?  I am not saying it is a good idea, but I could do it.
I would go to bitaddress.org, generate a public/private key pair and send both doge (for example) and bitcoin to it.  Then both the bitcoin and doge blockchains would have their respective amounts recorded.
Let say I had a donation page for a charity, one QR code, one address to where people could either send bitcoin or other altcoins.

You have to think about what the word means which you are using in your question, the word "backing".
The word invokes the notion of a guarantee which begs the question as to whom shall be the guarantor.  Is it a government, a company, an individual?  No matter who the guarantor is that "backs" your bitcoin, you will have a counter party risk to honor the backing agreement or contract along with a regulatory framework and court system to enforce it.
So you are right back to square one with the current centralized financial system, where a "backed" bitcoin no longer provides any differentiating value.

Last night, when the miners started to posture about getting serious on the fork, the market hit $880, communicating that going down the BU road is the path to a shit coin.  BU started to back off overnight, price recovers.  Now the miners know that BU is no longer in their best interest, its a dead end.
Price is now going to settle out around a $1000, and the market wants to know and asks "do you want the shit coin (crash) or do you want SegWit (continue our march to $3000)?"

There are approximately 100M households in the United States, very few will ever be able to say they own more than one bitcoin.  Not counting all the households in Europe and Asia.

That's expensive.  Current network hashrate is 7,078,041 GH/s according to bitcoinwisdom.com.
Assume power consumption is about 1W/GH/s (for the Jupiter miner from KnCMiner, other deployed ASICs are a bit higher but lets assume 1W/GH), then the total network power is ~7MW, or 7000KW
At 10 cents/KWh, the hourly cost would be 7000KW * 1 hr  * 10 c/KWh, or $700/hr.  One block every 10 minutes, or 6 blocks per hour, yields $116/block.   QED

As a libertarian, you should realize that banks aren't private free enterprises.  They have been granted a monopoly license to loan our money, the people's money, into existence.
In a sense they are a private cartel that have been contracted to act as a public utility, the utility is our monetary system.  Thus they must be highly regulated.  Don't confuse banks and financial institutions with free enterprise.

So right now less than 200k people have at least one BTC.  Since a lot of people have more than one wallet, the number is probably around ...120kish?
How many wallets have more than 10, 100, 1000, 10k, 100k, and 1M BTC, and 1M BTC that aren't owned by twins?

They have to open up a new bank account and wait for the check to clear.  If the check was for a few thousand dollars, that wouldn't take very long.
The check bitfloor is depositing is probably in the 100s of thousands, if not a few million dollars.  Hence the 10 days.
We just have to wait until the first week of May, bitching about it isn't going to speed things up.  Complain to Capital One Bank if that makes you feel better.

That is how fractional reserve banking was invented back in the Middle Ages.  They "vaulted" their gold with the gold smith who gave out receipts of the amount.  Going to the gold smith, picking up the gold, pay for your goods or services with the gold, and the receipient re-vaulting the gold, they instead exchanged the gold receipts.  Once the receipts became common, it became rare that people redeemed any gold.  The gold smith then could write out fake / counterfeit receipts for gold that wasn't stored and vuala, modern banking was born.

Not so sure about the assessment of a miner.  Miners get rewarded for services rendered, that is computing hash numbers.  You could get coin for mowing someone's lawn.  If you sell your coin via craigslist, how does that make you money exchange service?

@_date: 2013-04-17 05:44:08

How so?  At the end of the day, any exchange, whether it is decentralized or not, needs a bank to hold fiat investor funds.  The database which signifies what portion of the fiat funds belongs to whom could be decentralized, but the account that holds the fiat cannot. Perhaps you can have multiple accounts, but you still need bank accounts. I don't see away around it, but I could be missing something.

Buying from BFL directly is about $50/GH/s.  CloudHashing are charging $250/GH/s, a 5x markup.  They only edge they have is that IF they did order 6TH/s from BFL, you would get delivery after them.  Another thing to consider is when CloudHashing placed their order.
Of course this assumes BFL will ever ship, which I think they will.
Disclosure: I ordered 2 SGL600Gs from BFL on April 1st, even though I had serious doubts on whether they would ever ship.  Given recent announcements, I am not that worried anymore about whether BFL will ship, I think they will.

The cost of electricity per transaction is of concern.  Though, at 64k transaction per day, which is 2700 per hour, or a little over 1/2 transaction per second (~0.7 tranactons/sec).
If this goes to a 1000 transactions per second, or 84M/day, the cost would go down to $0.20 per transactions.  Still kind of high, but about an order of magnitude less than credit cards.  
You do make a good point, and cost/transaction is a metric that needs to be considered.

The calcs are wrong.  The current hash rate is 7PH/s, or 7,000,000 GH/s.  Assume 1W/GH/s, the mining power consumption is 7MW, or 7000KW.
At 10 cents/KWh * 24h/day * 7000KW, the energy cost is about $16,800/day.
Divide THAT by 60,435 tx/day, the cost is $0.28/tx.
Someone pointed out the current limit is 7tx/s, or 604k tx/day, where the cost would come down to 2.7cents/tx.
