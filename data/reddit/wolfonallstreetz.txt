“Kid” lol do you realize the technology your “kids” (granted you have any) will acquire in their adolescents.. will seem like wizardry in our eyes. Same way our grandparents attempt to grasp the idea of WiFi. Gtfo before you judge someone on their assumptions.
If we had more individuals with the train of thought similar to yours, we’d still be riding horse back, “kid”

During times of turmoil.. I always reference the US deficit. 
Even if bitcoin goes sub $6k.. 
It’ll come back even harder. In the time we live in and they age we’re headed towards fiat will fail.

I’ll admit I’m in my 20’s so technically I am a kid.. but the funny thing is, is I don’t own any BTC. My post was aimed towards the underlying technology which might allow for a “universal digital currency” to exist and allow for a paradigm shift.

Any news on that huge futures contract on OKex?

I wouldn’t be too sure.. one can be “certain it will not help crypto” I would love for you to expand on this when sovereign countries continue to print more fiat currency, at the same time national debts continue to rise?

Bitcoin will go up simply due to this memes existence. I guarantee it..

Please persuade me to what would be a better investment of $100 or suppose $1k... that would provide me a better return (hypothetically).. 10x in four years is a fabulous return..?

If I had a bitcoin for every time someone said btc was dead.. I would still have more money than if it were traditional fiat currency. Bitcoin was an idea to help the hopeless. What it sparked was keen signs of a type one civilization (kardashiv scale). 
To be quite frank, if you’re scared of loosing your money feel free to sell all the crypto you have. The ones that are invested into this sphere are here for change and not simply profits. 
A universal form of currency is not out of the ball park, and I will bet all of my money that it will not be any form of fiat.

If it does.. I know many baby boomers might consider investing.

All they’ll ask for is 2 years W-2s (salary wage) + 3 months bank statements. Just ensure none of that is reflected on your statements for the previous 3 months and you’ll be fine! 
I work at a local Credit Union.

No they will not scrutinize purchases the way the do deposits.
