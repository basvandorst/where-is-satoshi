Ok so here is something completely legitimate:  It's the world's first licensed Bitcoin-only sportsbook, providing a safe and simple betting environment. I recommend anyone with an interest in sports betting try it out. Also, your initial deposit will be doubled, so there's that.

There's quite a few out there but  is my default. You use bitcoins as your betting medium, which ensures security, plus it's all really user friendly. I definitely recommend you check it out.

Wheel's pretty cool. Also, just signed up and you get a free double your deposit bonus - loads of betting options with nice odds too, looks quite promising so far...

Let's take it to the next level and assume one should bet big WITH bitcoin;) Seriously though,  is the world's first licensed Bitcoin-only sportsbook. Safe, secure and easy; it is an ideal platform for those with an interest in sports betting. Also, you get a 100% increase on your initial deposit up to 1BTC. I highly recommend it be tried out.

Sounds like it has a lot of potential, I like the way xbet's users can choose their own odds. Do you think this could work effectively in the long term though, it still alludes how exactly the blockchain is used?

And now for your opportunity:
