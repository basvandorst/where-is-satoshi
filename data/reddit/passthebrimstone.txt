Master skywalker, there’s too many of them, what are we going to do?
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:24:43
This is getting out of hand, now there are two (many) of them.

But more importantly where to trade with NZD?

Thanks! Much appreciated, I just wish bitcoin was easier to get into (I’ve been quite worried about the split but people seem confident that everything will go fine)

I’m in a similar situation, I noticed OP is using coinbase, is it a good/secure start? Or should I use something else? 
Edit: or is a hardware wallet the way too go? Sorry I’m a complete noob here.

Try splitting the blockchain, that’s a good trick.

Isn’t the 2020 btc one a little pessimistic? 1 btc for only 1 sports car? That better be solid gold if you want a whole bitcoin.
