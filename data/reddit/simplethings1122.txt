You can also trade bitcoin to dollars and back which does the same thing. Making trades back and forth doesn't mean the value of your holdings will ever equal your initial investment again. 
Sure it's not the end of the world if you weren't insane and invested your life savings. But just saying you can make some more trades into other currencies so that when those go up you can put it back into Bitcoin is a little simplistic to the situation. If it was that easy everyone on this board would be millionaires moving their holdings back and forth as each currency rises and falls.

The point was if you have two nodes A and B. They agree that since they send equal amounts of traffic back and forth to each other that they won't charge a fee to route traffic from one person's customer to the other. The losing end would be a node that sends more traffic than the node on the other side. Now they have no leveraging power and thus will have to pay a fee to send which would get passed to the originating node. This could lead to the smaller nodes having higher fees than these giant nodes. 
I'm not sure I fully understand this dual funding channel and how that really adds an improvement. You could already split some of your money to channels opened with large nodes and some of your money to channels opened with customers. Is there a specific use case, the PR is pretty awful for anyone without intimate knowledge and context of what they were doing when they wrote it.

Dude if you were talking about segwit it would have been nice to say that at the start. Not just start commenting on a thread about LN and Miners. 
Even then if miners don't have to make any changes and your not talking about miners then why did you respond to something that was talking about miners and LN. Why did you respond saying crap about the number of transactions and not just lead off with miners dont have a say and whether they make the changes or not their software will still support it. 
I forgot also. Don't miners or other processors have to be stood up to confirm the lightning network transactions? So something would have to change right?

Snap has a revenue stream with ads. It's different but it's there and just like CoinBase the revenue stream is not big enough to support their operations. If GDax has zero fees then how do they pay for those servers, developers, support staff and managers? 
I highly doubt they are turning a profit and would not be surprised to see massive losses reported prior to an IPO. What do the CEO's care that comment he says they are more interested in the community and SnapChat already paved the way for insanity. They had an IPO and prior to that the guy literally said we have no plans to turn a profit in the foreseeable future. The bar is set super low and precedent set for other companies that there is a sector of investors interested in get rich quick schemes and don't care about profits.

Your basically sputtering things out that make it bad at being used as a currency in today's world. Which your right, no one really uses it as a currency outside of niche situations. That alone does not make the price a bubble. There are other market forces driving the price outside of pure speculation of the investors.

I'm not sure how it works. It says US residents money is FDIC insured so I don't know who pays out first or which one pays in which situations. Their site currently says 98% is stored offline. I don't know what the value of the 2% is or if it would make a large impact in the BTC network but any hack at all I would think severely damages public perception and trust in them as an exchange.
Also it says all online storage is insured which means 98% of the bitcoins are not. But I have no idea how someone would hack the offline copies or what that even means. Do they print out encrypted versions of the private keys in bar code form or something and then stash that in a vault? 
** I read further the FDIC part is just for US Dollars of yours that they hold so I guess bitcoin theft would be covered by their insurance. Cold storage hacking based on how I'm reading their security site is not insured though.

That's valid but that doesn't really matter in this situation when talking about using it as a currency since we aren't talking about an all in investment. I think everyone agrees that it's dangerous to put all your money in bitcoin. So for rational people they would have money outside of Bitcoin that they wouldn't invest. From there it's a decision of which one to spend. If you believe your investment is good then you wouldn't spend it. You would pick which ever thing you thought wouldn't appreciate as fast and use that.

Yea you can, but will any actually use you though? Very unlikely or probably not enough to make it worth running. 
People are going to take into account that your node is unreliable, it can't send the entire payment, it's slow at processing etc.. Those things are going cause them to skip over you when choosing the most efficient route. Unless you are being some gateway for a couple different businesses that you are the only route for then you'll probably get skipped over.

No one is going to ban them. Especially for exchanges. The client side is able to take advantage of 24/7 high frequency trading to make a lot of money. The Exchange get's paid when these bots make trades so the more trades the more money. 
The only way this works is if someone opens an exchange that does not allow bots and everyone and their mother switches to that. The likely hood of that happening is very small but not impossible. 
Outside of that the exchange could attempt to identify bots based on how they are trading. Their trading patterns should be easily identifiable as outliers unless your entire platform has been taken over with bots. Bot's outside of HFT bots are not really a big problem and don't provide that much of an advantage over humans other than being more disciplined with sticking to a strategy which most of the time is just re-balancing.

I say pump and dump because the price seems be driven strictly off of the influx of people. People who are flocking in not because of substantial news about the use of bitcoin but because they see ad's, comments and news articles about how bitcoins are shooting up in value and making millionaires. Because of the limited supply and new people its a self fulfilling cycle. 
Like most pump and dumps you can make a lot of money if you can time it right. You are probably correct, and without any regulations this can probably climb to even larger highs. But with people buying it strictly to make money on it's appreciation I can only foresee a massive sell off once the gains slow.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:59:03
Opening channels with normal users wouldn't really be a big concern. Your wallet doesn't need that much money in it and once the channel closes you can automate the money to be transferred to an offline wallet. 
Opening channels with businesses that receive funds would be complicated to secure since that would require a hot wallet. You probably don't need to have all of your free coins in that hot wallet though. You could do a fraction of your total coins in the wallet. Ideally if things are run right and business is good. Your hot wallet would only have a small fraction of your money. The rest would be tied up in payment channels. When one channel closes that money should be either put back into another payment channel or swept into an offline wallet.

I'm not arguing about a and b I'm stating facts. Just bitching about miners not wanting to adopt it is dumb. It's easy to see why they wouldn't want to. 
They will adopt a practice that is less lucrative only when they have to. Their only incentive to do so is if they are making money from the lightning network or failure to adopt it would result in them making less money than they could.    
I don't know how the upgrade works. Do miners need to do anything special to support it or can it be introduced into the block chain without the miners having to make any changes to the protocols they are running? 
If you can upgrade and start using the lightning network without the support of miners then who cares. None of this matters, someone will start offering the services and it will become a thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:00:53
The concepts we use today were not built just to screw everyone over. Yes they may have been warped and screwed up a little bit by people gaming the system but they are good ideas.
The LN network will help facilitate that just because to run a decent node you need a lot of capital. Something the average person or business does not have. The easiest way to get that capital to grow your node would be to offer secure storage for people's coins in exchange they get to use the coins to open payment channels and customers get a small percentage of income from that. In banking terms that would be interest rates and loans. Conventional loans I feel like wouldn't follow to far behind.
I'm not really sure what the landscape will end up as but I imagine it would be something similar to the internet today. It would be beneficial to have regional nodes so that payments you do everyday in your area don't have to take multiple hops and incur more charges. You would have giant backbone nodes that could facilitate a large amount of transfers with the other nodes. 
Since the channel size is limited based on the coins you have. The hub and spoke topology would be more efficient than a mesh topology.

The simple fact that money in US bank account's are insured and for the most part has fraud protection is a reason that no one should feel their bitcoin is more secure than their US bank account. Barring, anyone in the fringe industries that the banking system does not support. 
Mass adoption will mean bank like systems being created. The lightning network is one step in the direction of this. While you can escape these things, most people will not. Most people don't want to be bothered being their own bank with their own security.

We need a real answer from them on why they do this. I would assume the 2% they keep online runs out and they have to pull in coins from their offline storage. They just don't have enough coins readily available for people to mass sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:46:00
It could have very well gone from 0 to stable if it was actually being used as a real currency and that was the driving factor. Sure there would have been jumps here and there as more adopters came on, but those adopters would have hopefully bought in because they needed it in order to perform some transaction. 
At this point you can't actually use it correctly without someone on either side of the transaction fearing that they will lose out.

@_date: 2017-12-22 17:42:49
Their system is flawed when it comes to a huge customer rush. They only keep 2% of their coins online which means if too many people come to buy or sell they are going to have to have real people, not automated do whatever they need to do in order for the offline storage coins to be available. 
While that system helps them be secure it screws them in these situations.

The way LN handles it has it's pros and cons when compared to common credit cards. As as "responsible" consumer credit cards are infinitely more beneficial. As a business though credit cards freaking suck to accept.
Common credit cards also support most currencies. I can use my credit in Europe at a cashier that only accepts Euro's even though everything I do is in USD. There would really be nothing stopping that from happening with credit cards and Bitcoins. Maybe some new terminals would need to be created in order to specify the payment is in bitcoin or maybe just upgrade the software in existing ones. 
As far as bank services. My theory is large nodes will expand by offering bank services. Like securely storing your coins for you, providing insurance like coinbase in case of hacks and storing most of it offline. In exchange they may pay you an interest rate since they would then use your coins to make money by investing it into their LN nodes to increase their transaction capabilities. Maybe they don't charge you a fee to use their LN node if you are banking with them. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:57:34
The only way it really works in a beneficial manner at a large scale is for LN nodes to become a weird mix between banks and ISP's. I imagine there being very few really large LN Nodes that hold very large payment channels with each other. Ideally these channels would remain open for very long times and the amount going back and forth between them would be relatively equal.
Normal users would lock up their funds to a large LN network and not do the math about what they are buying.
Businesses wouldn't lock up any of their money but instead have the LN node open a channel with a bunch of money on their side so that people could send them money. The amount of money in the channel would have to be thought of before hand by the business because the LN node will charge them a fee based on the amount of money they open the channel with. So you don't want to do too much more than what you expect to receive in a month or whatever term the channel is for.
Then people who don't want to deal with managing their own wallet will start to just use the service the LN nodes offer to securely store their bitcoins. This is when we get into bank territory. To entice users they may offer fraud protection or other services. Maybe offer users a interest rate since they could then use their coins to open payment channels and make money off of it.
We will come full circle and reinvent the banking system. Just with blockchain as the underlying ledger.

@_date: 2017-12-28 19:37:25
This is true. There are no rules governing how things should be routed or handled. With the centralization I imagine users really only opening a single channel to one node which acts as their default gateway into the network. 
There is nothing stopping the default gateway from pulling a bunch of shenanigans and being a holes. They don't have to peer with people they don't want to and probably won't and market it as a way of keeping your transactions secure. 
A disjointed network could occur similar to credit card issues where nobody takes my freaking discover card because they don't want to deal with discovers bull.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:24:04
The fees are not completely laid out. The fee could be an agreement with a node where you pay interest on the money of theirs you lock up similar to what you do with loans. So at the start you may pay 3% interest on the 10k as you actually use it the fee would be less because now you are only paying 3% of 7.5K. The issue with charging fees per transaction for businesses is it doesn't stop businesses from trying to request an unnecessary amount of money for you to lock up. That would deter companies from requesting 100k when really they only receive 10k a month in payments. That node would be better suited breaking that 100k up to other businesses or nodes.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:12:46
But the question is that percentage per transaction actually high enough that they are turning a profit. Without seeing their books it very well could be they are always negative and living off of funding to make up the difference. They could have the same issue as Snap where increasing their revenue stream would annoy customers and cause them to jump ship. The cost to consumers to switch platforms is near zero.  
If that is real they are not profitable
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:17:54
I would imagine that fees for users would be relatively small. Businesses that want to receive money however will have to pay some type of interest payment on the node's money they have locked up in the channel. Someone that opens a 10k bitcoin channel and never uses it costs the node money vs someone that opens a 10k channel and has the node send them payments. 
With that scheme businesses hopefully will get hit wit the majority of the fees and users wouldn't have to pay much if anything.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:33:01
You can't just dismiss the 3rd party aspect of it. It's fundamental to the whole thing working and people not cheating the system. In fact the more separate entities acting as processing nodes the safer the network is. They do influence your transaction in the form of fees imposed on confirming your transfer of funds. Sure they can't change your transaction but they don't have to confirm your transaction either. They can freely choose to skip over you for a transaction that is paying a higher fee. So in that they can influence your transfer. If they really didn't have any control nobody would pay the fee. The tube at the bank doesn't charge me money to send my money to the teller. The tube also doesn't validate I'm not lying when I send a withdrawal form of 1 million dollars to my teller. The tube is more or less the internet. Your 3rd part nodes are the accountants verifying the financial integrity of your transaction. Accounts don't work for free and your transaction can't happen without them. 
Well with the current exchanges and new people I wouldn't be surprised if the US government is able to petition coin base to freeze someone's bitcoin assets. But hopefully someone in a situation where the government freezing their assets is a concern is also smart enough to transfer their bitcoins to a private wallet. Which would be traceable so you would have to be on the run or they would probably just throw you in jail. 
As for carrying it around, you still need something to do the transaction with. You would be a fool to trust a 3rd party device to type your private info into. That means you either need one of those bitcoin debit cards, your telephone or computer to do the transaction. But yea you could potentially memorize your private key similar to people memorizing their bank account numbers or credit card numbers. But using your private key on untrusted devices is risky.
The lighting network even though I haven't actually deep dived into how it works seems promising and could make things a lot better. I don't completely understand why both parties have to put equal amount of money in the lock box (maybe I misunderstood it) but hopefully that becomes clear after I read through all the papers. 
It would be nice, if one of these side chains offered some consumer protection. If I buy something online and the person never delivers what do I do? What do people currently do in those situations write it off as a loss or does it not happen very often?

Software development and computers has been my whole life so automating things, including bots is natural to me and I see nothing wrong it.

Bot's can do some serious damage simply by the sheer volume they are trading. So there are legitimate reasons why they shouldn't be allowed. A normal user however could do something equally stupid but hopefully in those situations they would see their error and not keep pounding a way.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:23:06
No a business would not really be required to open with any BTC unless they intended to also pay out that channel. Even in that scenario if they receive money first they can then use the funds they received to pay someone else with by sending the payment back through the channel. 
It would be beneficial for a business to receive and send on a channel as it would allow them to keep the channel open longer. Not indefinitely though since the point of a business is to make money so more should be coming in than what is going out. Eventually the node won't have enough money on it's side to send payments to the business. 
Reneging type of things may be possible and the protocol tries to stop it from happening and having people be able to broadcast past transactions in order to take back money that was spent. Transaction get stamped in a way that confirmations can use it to determine their order and which one they should use to disperse funds. Theoretically it is possible for both parties to agree to use a previous confirmation they sent to each other.

Yea, the price soared because of hype and a rush from consumers. The rush from consumers seems to be dying down unless we can get another media and hype blitz. I don't know where that is going to come from at this point though. There are coins everywhere chopping at it's heals. Bitcoin cash is full speed ahead trying to slander it and it has all sorts of convincing arguments that are only defended by "We are working on an off chain solution that should help". Bitcoin does have the we were first argument and most expensive per coin right now though.

Yes, but the way for it to work efficiently is those 51 people would all have already opened channels because they were using them in their day to day transactions already. So yes you would need to do 51 block chain transactions to open the channels but then you wouldn't need to do anymore if someone else wanted to send you money or you wanted to send someone else money. Assuming your channels still have funds available to receive or send.

Ethically speaking I see nothing wrong with it. In practice though there are all sorts of problems that come along with it. Market manipulation, which I don't think is ethical but that isn't a bot problem. Flash crashes or rises because the bots screwed up or they were programmed to respond to news which could have been faked. There are examples of those things in the current stock market. Then there is corruption of exchanges in which companies can get preferential treatment for trades coming from their bots resulting in their orders being filled first. 
The above is really only issues with High Frequency Trading (HFT) bots. Outside of HFT there are many uses that are just fine and don't have the same issues. Using bots to re-balance portfolios is a good example. 
The last part was because I wasn't exactly sure what you were talking about. But I guess it's more clear your talking about bots making trades on exchanges. The last part still stands for anyone, if your job is a repetitive client facing where most of what you do is take a client request, look it up in your system and respond then it would be wise to start looking at a different career path. Those things are currently and probably will be even more automated with bots.

Those are good features that will probably help the push, but you won't see a huge demise of alt coins until it becomes widely accepted for retail transactions. That type of marketing will cause people to jump ship because they think Bitcoin won.

There is generally some type of period in time in which the like kind exchange is considered a wash. I want to say 60 days, but I very well may be wrong. 
Yes you could argue that exchange an alt coin for bitcoin and back is a like-kind exchange. And you can file that as such, but if the IRS (I'm American) says it's not they will ask for their money. Then you can argue with them or you can just pay your taxes and move on with life.

That isn't huge considering the service they are offering. Their insurance bill can't be cheap, they arn't spending enough of servers and services if they keep crashing every time there is a rush. 
I'll wait to see their actual financial statements before declaring them a solid investment. Silicon Valley has a pretty good track record of funding turds that make no money with the idea that they can flip a switch and start killing it. 
As investment their company is just as risky as investing in bitcoin itself but would be highly regulated and more transparent so if I owned stock during the IPO I would dump it and wait for that post IPO crash that has become so popular.

What are you talking about man. Are you referring to a bot managing your portfolio to re-balance it? Are you referring to a bot collecting payment for something? Are you referring to a bot just asking for donations? 
You already have bots trading so you've lost that battle and your never going to win it. Exchanges make money on trades, bots trade a lot faster than you and I. They are not going to cutoff their most profitable customers. 
Bot's do and will continue taking over the remedial tasks that we pay people minimum wage for. Need to call in to check your account balance. Well a bot is most likely interacting with you to get that. Need to make a payment, your probably doing that through a bot too. It's just going to get better as linguistic research continues. You don't need a bot to understand and be able to have a full conversation. We don't pay people in remedial jobs to do that. They just need to be able to understand the context in which they are being used. That is a very narrow problem space that is pretty easy to set up. 
If your worried about a bot taking over your job, because your job involves repetitive tasks then you should start looking for something else.

No, I implied you need a lot of capital in order to be a node that is beneficial to connect to. 
You want to limit the amount of hops and fees. So large nodes with a ton of money that are well connected will be able to route payments with less hops than a mesh network of small micro nodes. 
This is why I also added the niche market part. There will be places where smaller nodes will be beneficial and be able to offer less fees but those nodes would still need a good amount of money to support people transferring funds to other people.

The price changes are pretty relevant. If you have $20 in USD and Bitcoin and you had to pay for the pizza. Most people would pay for it in USD because they believe Bitcoin will rise but don't believe the same for USD. So it does play a role in people using it as a currency.

It used to be that we were not allowed to discriminate and charge an extra fee if someone was using credit card. Thankfully that has changed and we can now push those fees onto customers.

If everyone sells that doesn't cause any issues. Wouldn't they need to sell coins or do they just use money out of their cash accounts. If everyone is buying it may not be a huge issue unless they have hard limits for policy reasons that they don't want to break the amount of coins that are insured for. They have to do block chain transactions eventually to put things in correct wallets.

You just described the worst scenario. A viral phenomenon fueled by people buying, holding and spreading the word to their friends. That chain of buyers telling their friends to buy is eventually going to end. What happens there. We all hold forever and the price stays the same or continues to go up. I highly doubt it.
Nobody here likes comparing Bitcoin to past events because apparently to them history doesn't mean anything and human behaviour is 100% different all the time.

It depends what the makeup of those 10,000 users would be and how you are connected in the system. So no one can really answer that question. 
At the simplest calculation you have 10,000 non receiving users each with 1 BTC. You could make one extra channel with a very large node that is well connected. That will allow you to forward payments for all your customers. Ideally so that you can account for all your customers spending all their money at once you would need 10,000 BTC to open a channel with the one major hub so you can send money. I'm not going to calculate fees to do the block chain transactions to open the channels. Practically you can probably get away with oversubscribing your capacity since it may be unlikely that all of your users send all of their money at once. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:53:43

Now what is off topic are all the insane and duplicate posts that are constantly on the front page alerting everyone to every single price change as if no one has any other way to check the price.

Channels can last as long as both parties allow it to stay open. So for for large nodes they may open a large channel with each other to route payments between their customers. If the amount going back and forth are relatively equal those channels wouldn't deplete funds on either side and could stay open forever. Just serving as a placeholder of funds owed to each other. This would completely eliminate block chain fees while still providing both companies security that they can get the money they are owed. 
As a company you would open it for the quick confirmation of receiving funds and because it will make it easier for user to buy things from you. As a user you want to use it because you won't be nickeled and dimed fees as you are buying coffee, gas, groceries, lunch etc.. That is assuming everyone accepts LN payments and the node your connected to can route payments to them. 
You would really only need to close a channel if you wanted the funds in the channel back. You depleted your funds and can't receive more money if your a business or you cant send more money if your a customer. Those situations would need to close and reopen a new channel. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:11:08
The only way it really works in a beneficial manner at a large scale is for LN nodes to become a weird mix between banks and ISP's. I imagine there being very few really large LN Nodes that hold very large payment channels with each other. Ideally these channels would remain open for very long times and the amount going back and forth between them would be relatively equal. 
Normal users would lock up their funds to a large LN network and not do the math about what they are buying. 
Businesses wouldn't lock up any of their money but instead have the LN node open a channel with a bunch of money on their side so that people could send them money. The amount of money in the channel would have to be thought of before hand by the business because the LN node will charge them a fee based on the amount of money they open the channel with. So you don't want to do too much more than what you expect to receive in a month or whatever term the channel is for. 
Then people who don't want to deal with managing their own wallet will start to just use the service the LN nodes offer to securely store their bitcoins. This is when we get into bank territory. To entice users they may offer fraud protection or other services. Maybe offer users a interest rate since they could then use their coins to open payment channels and make money off of it. 
We will come full circle and reinvent the banking system. Just with blockchain as the underlying ledger.

Servers are used to scale so either they don't have enough servers or their code isn't designed for the number of users. Both are bad since servers are simple enough to deploy these days. 
SnapChat is one of the examples I use for proving Silicon Valley turds. They don't make any money and have no plan in the near future to do so. It's a company who's stock price is purely fueled by clever marketing. In fact, they not only lost money last quarter but they increased their losses by almost double. But sure one day they may be able to monetize more and then watch their user base vanish just as fast as Digg.com did when they sold out.

That is true and I didn't realize before that coin base had insurance for that situation which is a good start. People usually use banks to hold their money  not other individuals so that isn't the greatest argument to use in my opinion and money in those banks have a certain level of protection if something horrible at the bank happens. My account total doesn't go down just because they were robbed. 
But if people hear a lot of people were robbed and their is no recourse to get their money back it will not sit well. A lot of people have grown accustomed to consumer protections.

No not 99% that would be extreme. I said majority at this point are using it strictly as an investment. That could be anywhere between 51% and 99.9999% since you may be the exception of actually using it for things I will limit it to 4 9's.

But that would be a step backwards to stores. The fees would need to be a lot less in order to take on that risk. A lot of stores don't take checks anymore because of that. Cash or credit and credit cards are verified that you have the funds available before you can walk away with things.

People make assumptions based on the regulations. Remove the regulations and they can still make assumptions based on how people will react without those regulations. 
A good example is a crash. In normal markets there is a halt if it decrease to fast. This allows people to cool their jets and maybe get more of a perspective of what is happening. You don't have that in these markets. So you can reason that violent crashes just like the violent rise would be exaggerated as people rush to buy or sell without being given a chance to review why they are doing something. 
The absent of regulations doesn't change anything it just modifies the rules on which you make assumptions. Past experience and knowledge is still valid.

It will hurt profits and is a completely different business model for them if they were to become a LN node. 
They would have to change their business from mining to being something more similar to Western Union. That also takes a lot of capital to get started. Nobody wants to pair with the node that can only make $2 transactions because they don't have enough coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:15:22
I think they are probably one of the few places that are in a good position to setup a lightning node that would actually get real traction. They have a ton of coins they can tie up to be able to peer with a ton of businesses and they already have a ton of users so getting the client base wouldn't be that difficult. Simply allow people to scan QR codes in the app to transfer money to businesses at registers and they would be golden. Of course after they fix that customer support issue.
 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:22:07
That is for services not related to paying for things or your merchant accepting your payment. They are paying for the other services that they most likely don't take advantage of. Rental car insurance, concierge service, extra warranties on things purchased with the card, price protection, and fraud/consumer protection. Let us not forget about the usual cash back or reward points which when taken advantage of correctly can easily pay for the annual fee.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:51:59
I'm not sure people were saying LN is banks. But rather the amount of capital and resource required to run a LN node that is of any use will lead to centralization. Any smart business would then be able to offer bank like services to it's customers. The LN isn't the bank. The companies running the LN nodes could become banks. 
So the fact that these things wouldn't do one of the many functions of a bank automatically means it isn't a bank?

A trust system isn't far fetched but I don't see any incentive for these places to do that. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:55:04
I don't know about that. I would think that large nodes would charge a fee for tying up their money. The B2C side I would imagine would be free because the more users connected directly to their node network will allow them to market their B2B side. The B2B side for it to be beneficial will involve the node business to tie up large amounts of their capital which isn't ideal for businesses. So that will I assume be charged a percentage fee based on the number of transactions and the amount of money they open the channel with. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:24:58

That would in turn be less transactions on the block chain and thus causing miners to miss out on money. They apparently do understand the economics. They see that if they don't do it, they can force everyone to do transactions on the block chain therefore netting themselves more money. Seems pretty logical to me. 
Do miners need to update their code in order to support lightning network?

The name thing would be easy to get around and I don't think anyone is automating the signing up of bots on exchanges. Generally you let the bot run on your account so you can monitor it. If we are getting to the point of humanoid bots that are signing up and making their own money this way then that would be the least of my worries. They would probably be doing all sorts of insane crap before that. 
That is true, designing a bot that would fool someone into thinking it's human would be a little more difficult and really defeats the purpose. It's the not being human part that gives the bot's the advantage.

Anyone being able to act as a bank is scary. it's pretty easy to get scammed that way or trust someone who doesn't understand security. Even places that are supposed to be secure get hacked. 
If you have a decent amount of anything you shouldn't just let it gather dust. Money, invest it in something. Land, lease out to someone. Bitcoin is no different just there are not really any good opportunities for it yet. 
While yes LN would be backed, if you store your bitcoins in a bank like service that uses your coins for LN channels. There would also be nothing stopping them from also using those coins to offer loans. There would be nothing stopping fractional reserves. In fact it could be worse since there are no rules on what that fraction should be. The analogy stands and is still right. You also don't have to offer loans to be a bank.

I think it is a little more involved than just running a node on your computer. You would need to convince people to use your node. You would do that by providing value by being connected to other nodes that are connected to people they want to pay. Then you will need to manage the costs of all that. 
I guarantee node to node connections will end up being similar ISP peering. So long as you send equal payments you would waive the fees for one another. If you are on the losing side then you would probably end up paying fees which you would then pass on to your customers. They may very well be able to avoid those fees by going with a bigger node. 
You can probably stand up your own, but without putting real work into it you'll probably be out muscled if your just installing it on a computer in your basement and expecting it to just start making money.

You seem to think that no one can make any theoretical analysis of the market. I'm telling you that you are wrong because although you want to believe that Bitcoin is some revolutionary new asset where the rules of normal economics doesn't apply that is not he case. 
The reason that you are wrong is because you have the same actors playing in the game with rules that are only slightly different. Not different enough where normal market analysis can't be applied.

Unless you have both, a lot of capital and a lot of technical knowledge then that is a terrible idea. Something a majority of people would not have and something the majority of people that think they do have probably don't have. 
But not to say you are not some early adopter / developer who is holding millions in bitcoins. You could very well have the capital and knowledge. The majority of the world does not, and those people setting up their own LN nodes is a bad idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:46:59
There are a lot of reasons why your node may not be beneficial. If your node takes more hops that will translate into more fees and then you won't be used. 
If I have a path where I can send the full amount and only have to pay the fee for the one node then I'm going to take that route. 
If your node drops a lot of transactions then people are probably not going to use you. 
If your node takes forever to complete a transaction then people are not going to use you. 
I'm sure there will be some nodes that don't charge customer channels a fee to send payments but charge businesses a fee. That will also be better than your node for end users. 
There will be nodes that make mutual agreements with other nodes to not charge processing fees for their specific traffic similar to open peering agreements with internet providers. Small nodes won't be able to compete in the same game that scale.

Based on what their website says yes. And insurance will make sure people get paid. 
I have no idea how their cold storage works or what happens in the event that they get hacked while they have 2.5% of their coins online. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:22:21
No that makes sense. That is a good system when things are relatively balanced on the sell and buy sides. But can also explain why when they are overloaded on one side that the entire system breaks down because their internal system can't keep up. They would have to start getting coins from somewhere. 
If there are a lot more sellers then buyers they would need to start pulling coins from offline storage in order to try and sell as close to market price before giving the money to the client or else they run the risk of not being able to sell the coins for what they gave the client. 
The other way of buying, they can be screwed the same way if they don't actually buy coins at the time due to the fact that the price could keep rising and they end up losing money on the deal. 
So eventually their system breaks down and they can't rely only on that. Which to me would explain why their system blows up during huge rises and sell offs.
Essentially if they can't match a buyer to a seller internally they have to go to the block chain or their internal funds. In a situation where there are exponentially more on one side of the equation they have to hit the block chain or do some other finagling with off storage funds or else they run the risk of a horrible situation.

Yes, the channels don't have to opened with the same amount of funds on both sides. If you are a business or person that just wants to receive BTC and not spend it then you can ask the node to open a channel with whatever you expect to receive in a certain time period. This is where business dealing will take place because you are locking up funds that a node could use elsewhere so they will probably charge you a fee to have the channel open based on the amount and time period for them not closing it.
Normal people that just want to send payments would probably open channels with nodes but the node wouldn't put money into the channel since the person isn't expecting to receive any payments. 
All 50 of the people would need to be on the business side and have a node open a channel with them, with the node supplying money on their side so that they could transfer it to them. 
I have no idea about the security or if someone can hack it. If that is a concern then nodes and accounts connected to nodes would probably start getting some type of reputation system. People would stop using nodes that have a lot of complaints and migrate to well rated nodes.

There is nothing stopping large "retail" companies from setting up their own nodes. The benefit to their customers really isn't that great. They will still probably peer with other LN nodes that are more connected for the same reason that they still accept credit cards from major credit card providers instead of only accepting their specialty gift cards. They want to make it convenient for customers and make it easier to buy things so you spend money with them. The only real benefit they would get by configuring their own node would be if they started routing payments from customers to other businesses. Then they would get processing fee's or be able to charge the other business interest on the amount of money in the channel. But at that point it wouldn't be a payment channel with Starbucks but a payment channel with Starbucks and other companies. Starbucks would most likely operate that entity as a subsidiary or completely separate entity and then have the stores open channels with it.
It's basically as you were thinking. It doesn't benefit me to park 20 bucks a week at Starbucks, 150 at WholeFoods and so on. But what is beneficial is parking 500 at XYZ node that has connections to Starbucks and Wholefoods as well as with a large number of other businesses. Now my money isn't directly tied to a single company. Now I went from multiple channels requiring multiple block chain transaction to a single block chain transaction but still being able to send payments to a lot of companies.
Nothing is really changing bitcoin wise. If you don't want to use LN then your still free to post transactions directly to the block chain. This is just an alternative method to make payment confirmation times quicker and less expensive. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:43:35
It wouldn't be beneficial for a business to open a channel like that. The point is to not have to hit the block chain so only opening a channel for an amount that can be used up in one go wouldn't benefit you. You would be paying an LN fee and a fee for the block chain transaction for a single purchase. 
The paying other people is no different than the world works now. Credit card payments are not paid out instantly and people have to wait for it. Checks are not deposited instantly and sometimes don't make it into the bank for a week or more. Usually people pay suppliers on credit, net 30 day or have reserve funds. 
If you have a business requirement that funds should be settled weekly a LN node will probably allow you to close and reopen the channel every week. They may charge you a higher fee for the increased payout frequency but that is a trade off for you business.

Opening 50 channels is bad. Opening one channel to a routing node who would then route the payments to your 50 random people assuming those 50 random people are connected somehow to that routing node. You don't want to be paying transaction fees just to open a channel and then close the channel right away.

I mean the definition is pretty close, minus the "fictitious enterprise" thing.

They then get their returns because other people are investing at even higher prices. The cycle seems to be continuing as the craze and excitement picks up. Your being close minded if you really can't see that. 
To make it worse, tons of people are buying, then advertising to other people that they have to buy because the price will sky rocket and we will all be rich. It's a pumpers wet dream right now. At it's current state until its being used commonly as actual currency it runs dangerously close to the definition of a "Ponzi Scheme"

@_date: 2017-12-27 20:43:06
I don't really see that as a big issue. It's not like their balance sheets would show the LN balance as a liability. They can simply close the channels and get all the money back if people need it. They would never need to do that in order to use other people's bitcoins to fund their LN node. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:50:33
You must confirm two transactions in order to submit your transaction. So theoretically they shouldn't have the scaling issue and people confirm other transactions as their payment. Practically though no one knows if the system will eat itself. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:43:46
That is where I don't get it. If I want my money from the lighting network I need to close the channel. I also can't transfer 10 coins to one hub and that hub transfer 10 coins to the next person. So if anyone down the payment line does not have 10 coins I'm screwed. (10 is just a number I made up. Use .0003 if you want). 
Even if it's a one way transaction I read it as both parties still had to deposit the same amount of money. That means if starbucks wants to accept 20,000 coins they have to open a connection and tie up 20,000 coins. 
Maybe I'm not smart enough but large scale the system seems slightly impractical. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:01:05
That is rambilngs. Your saying because some people want to run a charity it'll work out great? 
You need to be well connected in order for people to want to peer with you. To be well connected you need a lot of capital which is not something EVERYBODY will have. So your left with very few that would have the capital to setup a node. This is not even including the technical capability to setup a reliable and secure node. 
Imagine being connected to a node that isn't connected to any of the places you want to spend money. You would probably switch to a better node. That node will soon become useless as everyone switches off of them. You can't get businesses to peer if you have no customers and you can't get customers to peer if you have no businesses. It's a chicken and the egg problem. 
So to make the barrier of entry easier large clearing house nodes will be setup to route between the smaller nodes. Still the smaller nodes will require a lot of capital at least enough to route payments for all their customers. The amount of capital needed to be one of these clearing houses would certainly limit it to just a few organizations. 
The system is pretty inefficient as a mesh network. It will naturally turn into a hub and spoke type topology with very large institutions running the back bone.

What are people around you using bitcoins to pay each other for? 
I think it's far fetched to claim a small number of investors caused this spike. If it was small the price would not have risen so significantly. The price would stay relatively stable as you and your fellow users of the system needed to move your money in and out of bitcoin. But as it stands you have been overwhelmed into the minority.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:23:24
There may be more people like you but that does not mean you are the majority anymore. I find it hard to believe these drastic price increases are caused because people are buying it just to immediately trade back.
What is your reason for using bitcoin's as a currency. Since you purchase just enough and then immediately spend it. That seems really inconvenient outside of anything that you can't use an existing currency for. And the area's where you can't use an existing currency is extremely small.

@_date: 2017-12-28 05:03:09
Pretty much yes. I had commented that exact thing somewhere else in this post. 
I essentially said the network will end up being a hub and spoke topology with large clearing house type nodes at the center. The outsides would be your institutions that deal with businesses and people. Even those will need a large amount of capital to start up. Since you would need to make sure you have enough money in the upstream channels to allow your users to buy things. Since the amount of money tied up in these upstream channels is probably pretty large there will inevitably be a lot of business dealing with getting them setup. Agreements on the amount capital both sides put into it, agreements of fees paid for it and so forth. A weird mix of banks and ISP type insanity. 
They need capital and one way to get more of it is to offer a service that allows users to transfer their bitcoins to the company like Coinbase and exchanges do. In exchange for keeping your coins safe the company get's to use them to open payment channels with businesses. They may try to entice users more by giving them part of the profits in the form of monthly interest on their money. Down the line these customer facing nodes may implement security and fraud detection to block payments that they believe are destined for nodes that host a lot of malicious accounts or payments going to a malicious account. Maybe they can detect that a certain account your sending money to is located a couple states away so they can stop payment since that probably wasn't you.
But essentially what this is leading to is reinventing the banking system on top of bitcoin. There isn't anything necessarily wrong with that in my book. Banking provides a lot of benefits to society. Maybe though this time it will be different since it would be a little easier for niche markets to be opened up and take the place of the central ones if people think they are getting screwed. Think local banks, it would be trivial to setup a local node for towns that provide very small fees since everything would be done within that node. But to provide any real international or even continental benefits these local nodes would need to connect to larger nodes to route transactions outside of the local area. 
From reading the draft published for lightning network, I got the gist that the developers understand that centralization of all this is inevitable and needed in order for it to operate to it's full potential.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:35:11

@_date: 2017-12-28 17:26:48
No you do not. Your traffic will be based on your ability to route payments efficiently. The document for this mentions routing protocols would exist to make payments as efficiently as possible. So taking things into account like total fees to take a route, the amount of money that, that route can fulfill of the payment etc..
If wells Fargo can do it cheaper and with less transactions then people should send their traffic to them. If you can do it cheaper then people should send the traffic to you. Getting connected in a way that makes it cheaper will be tough when dealing with Wells Fargo and Bank of America companies. They will probably have some type of peering agreement where they open a large channel with each other. This will make it more difficult for smaller people to compete.

I'm not really concerned with money being seized and neither is a majority of people. 
I pay zero's fees to my bank, in fact they give me money when I'm charge ATM fees by other ATM's. If your paying fees for just storing your money you are doing it wrong or don't have enough money. It's a fucked up situation that you need money to avoid having to pay money but I'm not on the losing end of that. 
People keep referring to money printed at will and all that and miss the fact that at a certain point Bitcoin will become unusable because to many coins will be lost or to many major players will own all of it. At which point this whole thing starts again and we try to use a different mechanism.

Does it really though? There can probably be a way to keep it offline, open a LN Channel and then just have the parts for that Channel always online.

You hope the people you are doing business with would return the money.

Pretty much, the same thing with slight variation on how transactions occur. The difference being that hopefully things are more transparent, more control is in the hands of end users and the system is less influenced or manipulated by large corporations. 
All of that goes out the window if my hypothesis of nodes offering bitcoin vault services to protect your money in exchange for being allowed to use that for banking purposes like funding channels with businesses or just reinventing loans. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:52:00
Yea as far as identifying the bots it would be things like that. Look at how many orders they do a second, how long they sit open, what time of days do they do them. A normal human probably isn't churning through it 24 hours a day. You can also look at what the spreads are for their trades. The amount of time between buy and sell orders. There are a ton of features to look at and be able to group exchange users. 
While hypothetically you could train a bot to trade like a human, it wouldn't really be that advantageous other than to automate calculations and trades you would have done yourself anyway. Those bots are not a big deal.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:31:52
Yes, I believe the whole thing will lead to a centralized platform which is good. A mesh topology for this is not beneficial and will cause an unnecessary amount of fees and require an unnecessary amount of money.. Hub and Spoke type of setup would be best. 
I believe there is a time period of when you can challenge someone else who tried to use a previous LN transaction to release the funds. It is possible that malicious participants do it, and then somehow block you from challenging it with the most recent transaction. That is a risk. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:04:44
You ideally wouldn't close the channel until you had to. Hopefully the node you connected to is very well connected and you can pay everyone you need to. 
It's not perfect, but it's quicker and cheaper, which makes it better than a new on chain transaction every time you want to transfer money. 
I literally have never thought about the issue of not having enough money to close a channel or looked up if the cost of closing it would come out of the distributions from the channel.

Nahh skepticism is good. Everything seems unhackable and perfect until someone completely kills everyone and makes off with a ton of the cash. In the case of routing though, you don't send the money until the next hop proves they delivered the money to your intended target. They can't prove it until they either have their next hop prove it or they send the money directly to your target and get the secret to give back to you to prove they send the money. 
So someone would have to lie about that which is not impossible but maybe improbable (I don't know the math right now) or they would have to steal your private key in order to fake signing transfers that they would then use to confirm on the block chain. There are places where attacks can happen but I don't know the difficult or the type of surface area that is available for them. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:06:51
Nahh, companies like that wouldn't be the ones setting up LN nodes. There is zero benefit from that. 
What you would have is western union type companies to route your payments to people. Starbucks and Whole Foods would open channels with them. You and I would also open channels with them. This means that the money I tied up with the LN Node will be able to be spent at a lot of different places without having to open more channels or hit the block chain again. 
These LN nodes would probably peer with each other similar to internet providers in order to provide even more customers for companies and access for customers. 
In this system you would have "bandwidth" limits similar to what you have now. Normal end user like you and I who wouldn't be receiving payments would have high upload limits which in this world is free. Businesses that receive payments would have high download limits and possibly upload limits. Charging business for download limits is probably how they will make most of their money. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:19:42
So since you run one companies can't run one? 
The logistical part of it requires a lot of capital to be efficient. That is limited to early adopters who have a ton of money for buying in when it was super low or large businesses that just have a lot of capital. 
Small nodes don't serve that much of a benefit outside of niche markets. You will need to peer with larger ones in order to connect to the rest of the world. In this case larger just means nodes that have a lot more money than you so they can process more transactions.

Right on the block chain. But what about a LN node. What stops a LN node from charging interest on the money that someone needs them to put on their side of the channel.

With credit cards you authorize when the order is placed. This ensures the funds are there for you. Then when the order is shipped you invoice and charge the authorization to capture the funds. 
So long as it is a reputable business I would just pay the whole thing up front. I'd rather not be pestered over and over to release funds.

That is true. The barrier of entry will be created by those people that run the large backbone nodes.

It's similar trust that you put into your internet connection if you are using a secure connection. You probably don't want to associate with bad nodes. You will have to have some trust in the system just on the routing side similar to what we have now for networking. I don't know what the next router does with the packet, I just know it says it can get it to the person I want and here is the score on how well it can do it. The router could be lying but we trust people don't do that.

It's all the same thing. Bitcoin is trading like a traditional asset right now even though the underlying technology is different. 
The only real difference between the two is no central exchange to clear everything. So you may benefit if a major sell off in one exchange happens and the price on that exchange crashes. You would still have time on yours to hopefully sell everything before it propagates to yours. You can probably relate that to companies being listed on multiple exchanges. Off the top of my head, Vista Gold is listed in the Canadian exchange and US.
How people are buying and selling this stuff isn't new at all. That has all been abstracted so far away so that it looks and acts like a normal exchange.

I still don't fully understand the LN. I tried reading the paper but it didn't seem like it would alleviate that much pressure from the block chain. 
Is LN the solution for me buying coffee or gas or is it just used for a Venmo type scenarios? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:12:24
it's not beneficial for everyone to be a node. I don't want to peer with Billy Joe that can only send .0000006 of my transaction to Carl so I have to make 10 different LN transactions with 10 different channels just to send someone .00004 coins. 
You want large nodes with a lot of funds so that you don't worry about that crap. They can fulfill the payments their customers want to make without any issues. If I have to keep opening up additional channels because the one I'm on can't send the money I want to send then why bother with that node. Lets just switch. Eventually all the normal users, those that are not super technical or extremest will centralize on nodes that provide the most benefit.

A rational person that believes in bitcoin and believes it's price will go higher will always choose the fiat currency if they have the choice. A rational person that believes bitcoin is priced to high will always choose bitcoin over fiat. 
If you do anything else when you have the choice of bitcoin vs fiat then you made a bad decision and should not be giving anyone any advice. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:42:06
Right, ignoring transaction fees, and assuming the price of bitcoin does not change between the time you spend it and repurchase it then it doesn't matter which you choose. Financially speaking it would all be the same. But that isn't the current state of things.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:06:42
So you see the $10,000 as a correct price or over hyped? 
There is value in a distributed ledger but as it currently stands the price is insane, the network isn't very good at performing transactions in a useful manner for day to day transactions. So the use of the distributed ledger is slim in this case. If my assets are frozen what can I do with bitcoin, how do I pay rent, how do I buy things? Is there a place I can exchange bitcoins for cash? Bitcoin doesn't do any good in those scenarios.
What is the scenario that pushes the extreme price in your mind, people using bitcoin day to day to purchase coffee and gas? Or is it strictly a 100% gamble with no known outcome just hopes of high value like what is currently happening? 
This whole thing started because I was trying to figure out if anyone had a reason for the extreme rise in price outside of people hyping it up. When I'm seeing random posts from people on Facebook about how everyone should invest in bitcoin for no other fact than the price has been shooting up then it seems people are hyped for no reason. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:19:46
At what point do you see people getting bored with Bitcoin and the price comes crashing down? This push seems to be real hyped.
I think about investing but the only thing I can come up with on why the price is going up is because people want to buy it because the price is going up. A lot of people can't actually use bitcoins in any practical way. Right now it looks like it's the same as investing in comic books to me. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:19:48
I have said it before. If the world goes to shit who the heck would want to trade for gold. That doesn't help me live. But unlike bitcoin gold is a tangible item, it's a fashion statement, it's has useful properties that make it valuable to make things out of it and normal people can use it to buy things. Bitcoin isn't quite the same right now. It's very limited in terms of what I can use it for besides letting it sit there. But if you tell me how gold compares to Bitcoin sure. 
and yes if a new material came out that wiped out uses for gold it would become less valuable because no one would need to buy it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:41:20
But why is it increasing? Can you give an actual reason besides there are more buyers than sellers and people are hyping it just because the price is going up? That isn't sustainable unless there is something that actually gives it some real world value. It becomes some thing I hold that I can't do anything with but it's worth money because other people want it and think it's worth that much. Pretty much every collectible has gone through this, baseball cards, comic books, beanie babies. Eventually people that would buy them stop caring, those left holding have no more buyers and without anything really backing it because I can't do anything useful with a room full of beanie babies the price of it tanks. What is stopping Bitcoin from having the same thing happening? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:35:20
You answered your own question. Your initial comment was a $500 floor for the cost to mine one bitcoin. If someone cheats and steals electricity their cost to mine goes down. Your other people that it costs $500 to mine could start to lose money as cheaper coins are pumped into the market driving the price down. Like normal business they cant compete because someone can do it for cheaper. This is what happened with crude oil and companies started shutting down or holding back supplies waiting for the market to go back up. Oil is something we all need so the price will most likely never drop below the sellers cost to produce unless someone tries to fuck everyone and sells for a loss. 
And again the production cost is only valid if people need or want bitcoins to do something which would create demand. Right now it's mostly speculation people aren't really using it to do anything useful. If the speculation falls off then the price will be driven by both the cost to produce and actual use cases that would make it worth spending that money to get bitcoins. But considering it's an extra four steps to buy something with bitcoin than my credit card I don't anticipate bitcoin itself really taking off for retail or online shopping outside of marketing stunts and those companies that are high risk under merchant account rules (porn related things).

Not with their stuff listed in exchanges but they can do what they want with actual coins. There is no shorting currently so you can avoid some of that stuff but nothing is stopping them from doing manipulative things other than just looking like a bunch of slime bags.

That is the biggest concern about viability in every day life. The confirmation time is way to slow for any retail interaction. It's why checks stopped being accepted after the first one bounces. Online sure, I can order something and I guess wait 30 minutes to a day for the transaction to be confirmed and my order processed. This chart is what I was looking at to see confirmation times. 
 
Just to note, I'd rather not wait that long for my order to be processed. When Amazon tells me if I order it in the next 2 hours to get it tomorrow I like to know that I accomplished that goal. Not that the bitcoin network was busy and I'll get it in four days now. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:28:58
I think you missed some of my other comments so I'll say it again. why is it increasing right now and why so rapidly. I understand there is value but it's real world practical use value has nothing to do with what is happening now. You just had the volume pick up rapidly on a finite resource not because people need Bitcoin to do transactions but because people are buying to hold because the price was increasing. This causes the price to increase more as people flock in and increase demand for the sole reason that they saw the price rising rapidly. How is that sustainable? Do you think the volume of cash to Bitcoin transactions will always be increasing? Eventually people have to start using it as actual currency but that doesn't look likely right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:33:54
You can't compare gold to Bitcoin. They are far from the same thing. Gold is a tangible item that aside from jewelery has practical uses. This helps drive the price, it's what made bartering with it possible. Because it had universal value with people it was used as the gold standard but that has since been abandoned in the US.
The gold index is still not the same as Bitcoin. It has influences that gives it value to people outside of just trading volume and it's limited supply. 
Bitcoin strictly lives as a currency and for most transactions it's not more convienent than a credit card or venmo/paypal right now. So there is no outside influencer really driving the price other than pure speculation and market volume all of which could easily change overnight due to many factors which could send the price down just as fast as it went up. Which was what started my original question. When do people think people get bored and stop hyping it up which will cause the trading volume to plummet. Right now it's being pumped so bad that random friends on Facebook are telling people to invest so they can get rich. That isn't going to last forever. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:46:01
A large crash to scare out a lot of investors that don't have any intention of actually using it to buy things. This would hopefully leave the people that actually use it to buy things left to prop up the price by demand. 
I have no idea how long it could take. I don't think what is happening right now is really sustainable in the long run so I hope it happens sooner than later so it can go back to being a useful tool. 
It has good uses and it would have naturally increased and been stable as more people started using it for it's intended purpose. But people went completely nuts with speculating it was going to be worth 100k a coin or the Mcafee guy saying 1 million a coin. Then all these sites are pumping the living hell out of it causing the short term demand to skyrocket.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:39:26
My world to shit theory was more or less war and total shit hole. At that point I don't think any currency is really going to help me. Guns, tools and other necessities become the currency again and we go back to bartering and living like those folks on the Alaskan TV show that comes on History or Discovery. That may be a little dramatic though. 
You could just as easily create a diverse portfolio of more stable currencies. If the whole world goes to crap and collapses then bitcoin isn't really going to help me either. 
What can normal folk buy with Bitcoin. The last time I looked at the time transactions took to get on the ledger it was pretty long. I don't think that is viable for retail sales. You don't know if you really got the money or the person really had the money until it's to late. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:54:33
If that turns out to be true that would be a crazy crash in price and probably worth investing in strictly for the next pump round. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:56:04
Everything has perceived value its how we decide if it's worth the price. Some things have higher perceived value because their rare or like gold it has some practical uses as well as being flashy. I don't think people are choosing to use gold for manufacturing because we perceive value. If they could find a better, cheaper and easier to work with material they would. This is not the same as Bitcoin, you can't compare the two in that sense. 
  
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:10:27
Dollars started as backed by gold. Gold was valuable because it had uses and people like the way it looked. Bitcoin does not have those same qualities. 
2.) this is essentially how I live my life. I usually don't have cash, I'm paid via direct deposit so for me my money is pretty much virtual. 
3.) It can be taken away. It has happened before. Your computer get's hacked, your cloud storage get's hacked someone sees your private key. The service you use to manager your wallet get's hacked. The difference is once someone steals your money there is zero way to get it back. You also have the issue of losing your key.
4.) The trustless nature is cool but doesn't equal it's current value 
2.) (What happened to the numbering) A third party in involved, in fact tons of other people are involved to verify the payment. It's nothing like cash. In fact the third parties is what gives it it's security.
3.) You do have to carry something. No one has their wallet memorized. I either need my phone, my computer a QR code or something with my address. I doubt people memorize that. 
4.) This was doubled and while yes between two parties it requires a lot of third parties which you will eventually have to pay to verify the transaction which would be more similar to credit card processing. 
5.) I hope so or else it's useless. 
6.) They need to get enough processing power to make confirming the transactions faster. The current time it takes is awful
I hope things settle down and it stops being this insane with prices. It's completely useless and makes transactions risky with the price being so volatile. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:46:31
The volatility needs to stabilize. With it going up so fast you shouldn't spend it. If the opposite happens and it starts going down really fast companies shouldn't accept it. No one knows what it's going to do and the track record is all over the place so it makes it an unneeded risk to accept it as a form of payment. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:12:46
I think if everyone is buying futures betting the price is going to go down it could cause negative price and cause people to sell. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:13:41
I'm with you. It's risky for people to spend if they think their money will double magically overnight and it's risky for people to take as a form of payment if they think the price can half overnight. It needs to stabilize. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:01:34
That doesn't make much sense. I think you meant the rate of new bitcoins created will decrease. Why would half the bitcoins in existence just disappear unless we expect people to just lose their wallets. 
That is true about all collectibles. They still make comic books, they still make baseball cards. There was still a market for rare or special players that was pretty large not to long ago. Why is Bitcoin different. You can have a limited supply of anything but if you can't get people to buy it because they moved on how are you going to sell it? 
Right now it appears people are buying them because they believe the price will go up. This is causing more buyers then sellers. This will eventually even out as there are less buyers. The price will stall  even less buys will come in because it's not going up anymore and since holders can't do anything with the coins they will sell and the price will fall. Whether people lose their shit and a massive sell off happens is still up to be determined but I don't see any reason why this is going up other than the fact that it is going up. 
The fact that it's unregulated will allow for some crazy price swings which you see here. When this does crash it could be just as fast as it went up which I can only imaging will set a record. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:53:50
It happens all the time. It's the reason gold operations are not profitable. If your cost to mine something is more than the market will pay you lose money. It's the same with anything, if the cost to manufacturer something is more than the market will pay you either sell for less and take a loss or sell for more and risk no one buying it which will result in the same thing as selling for a loss. 
The design of it will make that false. It's designed to run out of new blocks and fees to take over as an incentive to verify the ledger. Which will result in people paying higher fees for faster processing. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:01:54
How, the biggest security risk is someone transferring all your money to someone else. Once that is done it breaks the whole contract thing if someone else can come behind and change the transaction or perform a transaction on behalf of someone else to return the money to you. That isn't safe. The protection credit cards give me will probably never be matched by Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:58:53
Currently it looks like people value it because it's increasing in price and that is not a good reason. Once that stops look out below and it'll be back to the normal prices driven by normal users that actually do have the same ideas as you. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:25:18
That's a solid use but doesn't explain this meteoric rise. I would think the subset of people that do that is relatively small but then again silk road probably played a good hand in helping the price of Bitcoin. 
I'd be curious to see if there were stats on the amount of transactions that are from exchanges vs those doing peer to peer transfers outside of an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:55:39
In my opinion yes.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:32:08
Your floor price is set assuming that the seller is the only one that controls the price of a good. If no one wants a good then it doesn't matter what the price is. If the market doesn't think it's worth $500 then the market won't pay $500. If mining isn't profitable anymore and they start to do transactions based off of fees they get from them. Then you will see processing fee's increase if you want your transactions on the ledger in a reasonable amount of time. If it costs more to use Bitcoin then credit cards and western union then it becomes problematic. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:56:02
