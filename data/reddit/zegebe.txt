Probably not sustainable long term, but seems like it might have been pretty consistent over the course of the day -
Initial report was $10,000 in less than 2 hours, and now $124,000 in 21 hours (or $11.8k in a full 2 hours)

Bitcoinium Widgets are my favorite - they have widgets for exchanges as well as for some of the popular mining pools if you happen to mine. For exchanges, it also shows the 24h high/low and volume in the widget.
I keep a MtGox widget on my main screen just to keep tabs, and one swipe to the right shows me a handful of exchange values.

Hey, yep - I did chat briefly with Nick last night. I figured the tablet problems were temporary.. didn't feel like making a fuss over it. Just happy to see more adoption =)
The first time I ever tried using bitcoin, the owner hadn't had internet at his bar for the past week (some issue he was pretty frustrated about) so I had to take a photo of their wallet barcode on the wall, manually convert euros to bitcoin, and after I sent the payment he had to manually check and make sure the transaction got confirmed.

Went here last night and paid via Bitcoin. Apparently was the first customer to do so! (their tablet's batter had died, I'm assuming after testing over the weekend, so they had to charge it back up and get back online before I could pay my check)

You do realize that well before git even existed, "fork" was a common way to describe when one thing split into two? i.e. "a fork in the road"
