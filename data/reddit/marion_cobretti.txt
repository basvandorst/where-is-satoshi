Bubble?? 
This is just a pimple on the skin of the Student Debt bubble! 
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:47:30
I feel you are looking at this the wrong way. 
We agree its a bubble. The only way it doesn't pop is if laws don't change. 




Very true on both accounts...but neither one of those factors matter ultimately. 
What matters is this. A debt pool growing in interest faster than debtors can repay. When your return for 200K worth of loans is a 35K/year job. You have no choice but to default. 
The banks dont care as these are federally backed loans. 
If the loan payments are sucking up more than their share of money. Money mind you that could be spent churning the economy and a generation drowning in federally backed debt. The Gov't will be left with few options other than to help these people get out from under their crushing debt. 
The tax payers are the ones who generate the GDP. It doesn't do a government any good to crush its own revenue source. This is why it has to pop. 
Again banks dont care. They will get their money either way. The only lobby that is against this is the universities. These are the shisters who created the problem in the first place. However, i cant really blame them. They sold college as a necessity and then charged a ton for it. If someone was willing to pay you 100x too much for you used car you'd take it and then let them worry about the resale value. 


It can and will if it's in the nations best interest AND is being voted for by the very constituents it stands to benefit. People always vote for free shit.

WAIT A MIN HERE! 
Hows does this get around the following problems: 
1. Double Spend - Using the video example. Bob puts .05BTC in the payment channel off-network. Then spends the same .05BTC on the main chain. 2 months later shop tried to close the channel only to find out the close is rejected because the funds were spent else where. 
2. 3rd Party Involvement - Opening and maintaining a "payment channel" that only occasionally adds a transaction to the blockchain. How is this ANY different than what VISA and MC do?? They process all the payments and send the retailer 1 big check at the end. Its just fancy escrow. i can see a very quick business opportunity here for companies that operate "payment channels" and act as a 3rd parties ?! 
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:02:12
Nice knowing you BOA! 
Ok so whats the over under until they reverse this decision???
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:03:35


This is given 


Assuming you mean "have". How so?? There's no consensus building with these Off-Chain transactions. So you are essentially just putting funds in escrow and then expecting them to be distributed correctly once the channel is closed. That's all well and good assuming the leger hasn't been tampered with. But if these mini-ledgers off-chain get exploited then someone isn't going to be happy. 
I get the idea but its really no different than when my buddy owes me $50 bucks. But says he's only gonna pay me $25 because of that one time back then when I owed him $25. So now we just even it out with one transaction.

How much of this FUD is pride??
I mean the biggest investors in the world I think have a hard time admitting they missed the mark. People ask them why they missed. Their response is denial and that it's a fraud because they didn't see it.
When the truth is. They have been trained to be experts at 1 type of game. The wall street game. With crypto it's a new game and it obviously doesn't follow the set of rules they are used to.
To me it's like asking Belicheck, why he didn't recruit a Clayton Kershaw. Rather than say "Baseball is not my sport" he replies "Kershaw is a fraud obviously"
Just my take. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:33:10
Ok maybe but that's just kicking the can down the road right?? 
You obviously don't want hundreds (or thousands) of channels being opened and closed on the main chain as you encounter the same problem right? 
So then you have Bob and Sally transacting Off-Chain with her not utilizing his channel and making up the difference with un-verifiable funds sent to Bob?!? 
The blockchain is kinda like a Jenga Puzzle with one main stack. If you remove any one part you lose the essential properties that make it valuable.

I'd just ask him point blank "Is mass adoption of cryptocurrency a threat to your organization? Also, how do you see BTC failing in the future and would you be willing now to use your personal fund to short btc on the futures markets? (Assuming you could trade like that)" 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:00:55
Its also bad for value.
The adoption of BTC increases its value. However, wall street never loses a bet. They are like Las Vegas in that when you win they win, when you lose they still win. 
Having ETF, Options and any other manner of investments and derivatives will quickly stabilize the the price of BTC. Because Wall Street like a bookie will play both sides. Then when it's completely sucked into the market. It becomes subject to market forces and market norms. Price and Risk will be equally balanced quuckly. Like, you cannot beat the market over the long term etc.
Good for adoption bad for overall value.

Ok it may not matter for you. But does it matter for the coffee company who does 10000 transactions each morning? Think it may be a good idea for them to keep records? 
Maybe it dosnt make sense from your point of view to prove one small transaction. But from another POV records may need to be maintained to prove millions of transactions.

Perhaps either I don't understand what you are saying or you are not representing your argument properly. 
The Proof Looks something like this. (Over Simplified) 
1. If Fiat Currency = Only Medium of Exchange 
2. Then the value of Fiat Currency is equal to the value of all things that are exchangeable. 
3. If we convert all Fiat Currency for BTC 
4. Value of BTC is now equal to the value of all things that are exchangeable 
5. If Value BTC after conversion = Value of all things exchangeable and Value Fiat before conversion = Value of all things exchangeable, then Value BTC after conversion = Value of FIAT before conversion.

Listen Im no expert aside from a decent MBA. 
But I've been screaming to anyone that will listen that Wall Streets ETF(s) for BTC are BAD NEWS!!! Their sole existence is a way to pump and dump the actual Bitcoin market value by controlling supply and demand without ever taking any actual possession of coins. 
Its a sham man!! Wouldnt surprise me at all if the biggest buyers and sellers of BTC futures are MINERS!!! The perfect way to make real USD by manipulating BTC.

SAID IT BEFORE AND I"LL SAY IT AGAIN! 
BTC ETF's ARE the reason the price is being held down. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 18:49:16
Essentially they are a way to suck investment dollars out of or away from BTC itself. Everyone was excited that BTC was going main stream on "wall street". But the ETF just give big investors a way to speculate on BTC without actually having to buy or trade any actual BTC.  
By pinning the ETF to the price of actual BTC they can short it and essentially suck all the downside risk out of the asset. 
Think of it like this....why would you buy a business when you can make the same money without any sort of operational burden. Wall street now profits when BTC goes up jsut as much as the do when BTC does down.

So what is the theoretical market cap for BTC? 
I mean I am sure someone has done this calculation right...so if you could point me to the article? 
Something like BTC is capable of handling X transactions = which is some percent to total transactions which is some percent of total current transactions. Which would give us an estimate of the current cap right? 
OK NOTE: Before all the idiots chime in with some minuscule point. "you didn't include..." "thats not how it works..." Please realize that I was just citing off the cuff as an example of the calculations someone has surely done. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:49:56
I dont disagree with any comments here. 
Just like to note that the survival of BTC is contingent on how many people use it. The more people involved the harder it is to kill. 
Many are stubborn...my dad still carries his Motorola Razor. But if you give out 30-40 Paper wallets and 30-40 people. Some of them...WILL get curious and get involved. 
To me its a cheap price to pay ... for better conversation with my friends and co-workers! 
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:21:57
Well I get that as an investment practice. But BTC utility is 0 if you can't (don't) use it. 
People want to hold because they believe BTC will increase in value. However, if you cant use it for anything and everyone is holding then its value wont ever go up.

@_date: 2017-06-15 14:40:09
I think this actually makes a lot of sense if you think about it from their perspective. 
1. The USA is VERY powerful. 
OK SIDE NOTE HERE PAUSE: I know this is going to cause a stir but this statement cannot be underestimated. I think many people don't fully grasp the power and influence of the USA. So for the sake of this post lets assume this is directly measurable and say that the USA is just as powerful as the entirety of the rest of the world. Obviously people are going to freak out with a statement like that. But I don't think its a stretch(IMO). Its not out of the realm of possibility that the current USA could succeed in a takeover of the rest of the world. Not as likely  or easy as it would have been in 1954 but still very much possible. 
2. That power is a direct result of the Green Back! Everything traces back to it. 
3. The US has complete control over the Dollar. Again believe it or not manipulation (at least for this argument) trumps market forces. 
4. Decentralized crypto currency represents a threat to the Green Back. 
Thus it flows naturally, and probably with good reason, that a large scale crypto-currency could be very dangerous to society at large. Hence legislation to control/contain the spread or adoption of such.

Industry and an unchecked market. But it dosn't matter. For sake of the argument lets say the Govt was 100% responsible for 2009. The bigger question and more important question than "Who created it" is "Who stopped it!" 
There's no arguing that Govt, and govt alone, stopped the absolute collapse! Its not like a bunch of businesses got together and said we see the problem and we can fix this if we work together. Even as you pointed out even only if temporary Govt intervention somehow put the plug back in the Dyke. But to me that speak to the power more than the fault here. 


This is my point sir! and what I fear everyone may be missing! its what scares me. Your "freedom" is a farce...you only think you are free because you live in a country that allows you freedom. Take away the country and you don't get "freedom without all the hassle". You may get tanks in the street, rifles in your face and no police to call when some gang takes everything you own. 
Again, I'm not saying this is a certain outcome and I appreciate you guys helping me think about this one. But I think a world with a great power may be a safer place than a world without one.

Sorry, 39584 - 10K = 29584 USD. My apologies for the rounding error. 
I own exactly 1.04204673 BTC as of today. Its certainly not much. But its money I can play with. 
No one, IMO, should be heavily vested in BTC. Its speculative and very high beta. If your livelihood is dependent on BTC. You might want to reconsider your priorities. There's lots of sound investment advice on how you should diversify and how stable you should be before you begin to gamble with investment like stocks etc. 
My advice to the OP is based on wisdom. Maybe I'm just an old country boy but no ones life is worth 30K in my book. Sorry ($39584.70). I'd be madder than a wet hornet if I lost 30K (sorry $39584.70) but Ive been around long enough to know that money is just money 30K will come and it will go. I've been robbed before, I've had things stolen, I've lost more than 30K in investments that didnt work out. Looking back, I'm still alive, no one got hurt and I'm no worse for wear without the money I've lost.  
I just think its about having the right perspective. It sounds to me like, perspective you don't have. Then since we are on reddit and you don't agree, its easy for you to act like a jerk. Well kid...thats fine too! 
Also, on a side note. Listen man I don't want to call you dense or anything. But you certainly don't understand world history. Might I suggest some reading. 
The Ancient Maya: New Perspectives - Heather McKillcop
I think you can find this in an e-Book but for me it was a college text. In it you'll learn much. 
Since I assume you aren't actually interested as much in reading a book as you are in judging and critisizing, performing quick internet searches and pretending you are an expert. I suggest you google something scholars refer to as "The Long Peace". To get you started hears an article put out by Harvard featuring Stephen Pinker. Neither one I will assume you'll find creditable sources once you Google. 
Anyway I wish you the best kid! I hope long life and bumping into enough walls will one day take some of the edge off. 
Take care.

Lots of universities have lots of theories around this...but no one is certain. 
The politics theory I'm talking about is well documented and has more academic support than drought. Or so I'm told. I'm no expert. 
It also makes more sense to me because its a systemic explanation and I tend to believe that results with many causes are more likely than "1 cause 1 result" kinda thing. Although its more difficult to prove. 
I believe other stupid things as well! 
1. Like cancer is a direct result of of the constant bombardment of our bodies with hazardous substances. Anyone of which by itself it no so bad. But we you sum the air we breath, food we eat, clothes we wear, chemicals we touch daily over 40 years! It takes a toll. But this is more complex are requires more thought than "cigarettes=cancer"  
2. Climate change is caused by the same systemic changes happening all over the planet! Many of them man made, many of them naturally occurring, all of them working together for a bad outcome. This is why the argument is not black and white.

The assumption that I live in XXX City USA, have a job and no real worries and can use BTC at Walmart...just as easy as USD at Walmart and nothing more will change is perhaps highly naive.

Message to OP:
Its 30K lost man. I know it suck I know it hurts I know how much you must hate this guy for being slime. But my advice is to let it go. Just think about it like this. Maybe he needed it more than you did. 
With you posting a bounty on Reddit. You are likely stepping into far more potential trouble than the value of the BTC. 
I mean what if someone does try to wrangle this guy and someone gets hurt. What if because of your "bounty" someone (more unscrupulous than he) grabs one of his kids. 
What if this guy, meant well with the business, got into a fix and did the only thing he knew how to do? What if your words get this guy jailed in India, his family falls apart, kids suffer etc etc on and on. I don't know just hypothetical. 
BTC is inherently risky because of this. But two wrongs don't make a right. Let it go and forgive...it will come back to you one way. ;)
