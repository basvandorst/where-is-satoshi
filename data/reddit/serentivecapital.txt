The words "Rapping" and "Crypto" in the same sentence makes me cringe.
Reminds of that BCASH one with Lil Windex. Not good.

Imagine how hard that would be with just a marker lol.
@_date: 2018-05-27 10:03:52
At least it wasn't "Exit all crypto's".

Need a QR code mate.

Err... was talking about the size of the transaction. Didnt think I had to explain it, guess I was wrong!
@_date: 2018-05-20 17:56:20
That's disappointing as we are moving up in price. Movements on low volume rarely last.
Oh well, hopefully the East can keep the ball moving up.

Oooh damn, RIP in peace, original commenter.

The best way to win this argument is to innovate your own project so far that your counterparts look like MySpace.

There was never any fundamental reason for the BTC correction.
The tech is stronger than ever.

There is a tear missing on the bottom picture.
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:16:23
This is brutal.
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:22:28
That's like saying Warren Buffett's comments on the stock market are meaningless. 
Who do you want to hear from? The amateur chartists on Twitter? 
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:30:01
What crypto does he tip out of the thousands?
@_date: 2018-06-01 14:49:18
In crypto you just can't win.
Most of the comments below are like "Yeah you would say that because you run a fund you shill".
If he had said anything negative everyone shouts "FUD!".
What on earth do you want the guy to say?
@_date: 2018-06-01 18:26:05
This is painful. 
I'm out.

They have been on sale for months.
There seems to be no new money entering this market.
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:00:57
Now who can argue crypto hasn't got class?
@_date: 2018-06-01 18:09:42
That's not a direct quote.
Do you know how to use quotation marks?
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:31:12
I see an Elliott wave in there somewhere.
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:48:58
Have you read the article?
He does not say that 
@_date: 2018-06-02 03:03:33
45.6% of the world's population does not have access to the internet... and that seems to have really hurt facebook and google...
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:24:18
Don't bother buying back if you can't handle volatility.
Stick to bonds.
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:41:38
I must be wrong then.
I can't see where there is a direct quote from the fund manager where he says to buy a specific coin. 
At least I know not to start a sentence with "Or". 
Boom. Peace out.

The current system is broken. Some would say beyond repair. Satoshi is not that person. He has the cure.

Very forward thinking. Viva la Revolution!
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:49:02
Great news and just shows the forward thinking of the East. Hopefully the West will collaborate. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:35:26
Centralised banks and the families who own them. All. Of. It.
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:47:51
Because it is decentralised and based on proof of work. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:26:41
Exactly, why force yourself to buy in on an arbitrary schedule?
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:12:44
Does the end not justify the means?
@_date: 2018-04-30 21:03:12
For a purchase of that size? Negligible, the sort of amount that if they added it to their markup you wouldnt even care
@_date: 2018-04-30 17:29:22
Breaking news: fiats are currently more convenient to use than cryptos. Much wow.

Why use a volatile currency to buy cake? Its likely she wouldve spent £400 for that cake this time next month
