So either MtGox did the entire btc community a favor by being the first major establishment to take a stand on this "glitch"
They're making excuses by blaming btc software rather than their own ineptitude
Can any devs weigh in on this?

People aren't dicks to newcomers because they're new. They're dicks because they're dicks.

Well I have yubikey purchased from gox themselves which i use for logins on gox.

Buddy, I have multiple BTC stored on your site and do not want to lose them. Thankfully I didn't make any exchanges during the period where you guys seem to have lost them all, but I want to pull my currency off your site the second I get the chance.
This is freaking me out and I don't want to lose my BTC because of your shenanigans. You're a company with millions of dollars worth of peoples' money. Act like a group of fucking professionals.

Is a yubikey purchased from gox themselves enough defense against people hacking my account?
@_date: 2014-02-10 10:34:23
They graciously provide a "warning" to all other exchanges and bitcoiners that this glitch renders everybody vulnerable. Again, I don't know if this is the political spin of the century or if they're throwing their weight around to get this thing fixed ASAP.

If this is due to some protesters outside jostling Karpeles' jimmies, then what he's doing is trying to extract a collective punishment on the community that hates him by drawing this out as long as possible.
He is, at the end of the day, nothing more than an immature and irresponsible baby who can't handle pressure, and we all were stupid enough to trust our money to this idiot. If he thinks that three protesters are bad, then I cannot imagine what will happen in the event that it turns out Gox is insolvent and shit really hits the fan.
Does Karpeles even realize what's at stake here?

This isn't about whether the law is right or wrong, or that the building owner is an ass, or that the officer is a drone. It's about making sure the voices are heard and that Gox feels the weight of their customer base.
Also, the protesters are making a stand against a pack of incompetents and, if rumors are true, criminals who are running off with peoples' money and potentially destroying livelihoods and the well being of its customers. Stop treating this issue so callously.

How are you guys communicating with the Gox people?
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:12:40
Article from coindesk does a lot to dispel the hysteria:
-Claim is that the owner of the building that Gox is located in is annoyed by all the press and coverage the building is getting and is worried other Japanese will think it is a cursed building. Hence the move
-Unverified users have the most to freak out about since they will definitely never get their coins back

BoA holds Renminbi? What city are you in?

I've concluded that my bitcoin holdings on Mt. Gox are as good as gone. This update has shut down any hope I had before.
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:53:52
I don't think they're competent enough to play meaningful psychological tricks on anybody. I just take one look at Karpeles' picture and that's enough for me to know he's a joke.
@_date: 2014-02-21 08:38:18
Those chaps aren't harming anybody. They're using the law as a bullshit excuse to get them kicked off the premises and silence them.
Also I can't risk going to Japan for a protest that is highly likely to fail. I could go broke.

I know it's popular to be a doomsayer, but I really don't think that Gox can simply run off with money and not reimburse their customers.
I mean Mark Karpeles is a public figure and people know who the employees at MtGox are. It's not like they're some shadowy group of people that can simply run off and evade the probably hundreds of thousands of angry people committed to bringing them to justice.
It would simply be easier for them to do right by everybody, accept their failure, and enjoy the money they made in their time as an exchange.
@_date: 2014-02-11 07:54:00
Hoping that the people at Gox will simply reimburse me in full rather than me having to go through third parties. We'll see if they respond to my request at all.

What would be the best way to get a donation drive kicked off? I'd like to take the necessary steps but I don't think anybody would trust me to handle the issue without running off with peoples' money.
@_date: 2014-02-11 08:51:07
Well, they've got my coins and they're sitting in my wallet so I want them. I don't care how they do it.
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:39:31
I am using a yubikey for my Mt. Gox access. I bought the yubikey from Mt. Gox themselves sometime last December. You guys think this is ample defense against hackers?
@_date: 2014-02-07 07:30:40
So what are the chances that these guys ever re-enable BTC withdrawals? I'm thinking never...
