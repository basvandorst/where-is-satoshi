no. this would be too much capital investment chasing profit that is too speculative. getting involved with bitcoins, including all of the tax/legal uncertainty around it, is not the sort of venture that shareholders support. there is a real chance that bitcoins could drop in value by half, or be outlawed by the government, that sort of risk does not look good in a sensitivity analysis.

didn't participate in the original, but i'll go in at $105.70

if you include a transition away from mtgox pricing, this chart would be even more accurate

i suppose you didn't ship to a paypal confirmed address? regardless of rapport, you need to have some sort of seller guarantee like a confirmed address to protect yourself.

this is incredible. i just finished my campbx 30 day aging period. this service puts campbx to shame.

awesome that you took the plunge and opened a physical exchange. however, your spread is looking pretty fat. if there is mainstream adoption you could be ok, but among tech-savvy buyers, they are going to want better rates. my bullion dealer has a 2.5% or so markup on his cost for gold 1oz, you may want to target something like that. you are going to have to make it a volume business to succeed.

this is a fine idea, but what does an anti-war stance have to do with bitcoins? it's hard enough to explain what bitcoins are, without alienating significant portions of passerbys why may find retaliation against the use of chemical weapons acceptable. keep it bitcoin only, and this is a very noble project.

thanks for the detailed reply. both asicminer and avalon are in China, i always had thought the 2 were connected somehow. hard to believe 2 separate teams there each came up with their own asic technology at the same time.

i am pretty sure that he didn't gamble (in the traditional sense), but he invested in this:

Can someone explain the difference between Avalon + Asicminer? Avalon is owned by Yifu Guo, and Asicminer is represented by Friedcat. Are these companies and people the same, or are they different entities?

Sorry this is not how government works. You either know the rules and comply by them, or ignore at your own peril. Not saying this is ideal, Lord knows I've had my share of erroneous bank levies (thank you California EDD), but it is how the system works.

i asked my bullion dealer about this case. his answer: that is why he deals in government-minted coins. he is willing to buy other gold, but assay must be paid by the seller. i asked him if tungsten bullion coins were a concern - he didn't seem worried about it at all, he just said it would be too difficult to do.

i have an account on there as well, but their inventory management is horrible compared to bitmit. but i hope they improve things, more competition is always a good thing.

this is going to add tremendous liquidity to the market, another step of the maturation of bitcoins.

personally I was sold after I downloaded Bitcoin-QT and actually saw a transaction happen. maybe you can install electrum for them and send them some BTC? yes the price is highly volatile, but so are things like emerging market equities, yet they are a legitimate asset class. it isn't as stable/safe as USD/EUR/JPY, but at the moment it plays a role as a hedge against inflation, and may be it's own legit monetary base in the future.
@_date: 2013-07-31 04:31:57
don't do this. there is no way selling bitcoins via credit card will work. even at $35/day, you are going to get chargebacks, and your merchant account will be flagged as a high risk. i can't see any way this is going to end well.

ah, cheers :)

thanks for sharing this, it makes me feel a ton better. going to send a tip, but waiting for transfer from coinbase to clear. it looks stuck for some reason.

considering that bitcoin users are probably the users most likely to use adblock, not sure if micropayments logic works out.
