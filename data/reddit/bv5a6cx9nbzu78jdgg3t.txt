It's worth it. They've been around since August 2011 (launched as MtGox alternative) - longest track record. No major hacks or security failures. Segwit implemented in September (soft fork happened in August). They're allowing Trezor 2FA. They have zero fee on withdrawals - perferct for buy&amp;hold investors. They're just super cool.

Banks are staying away from CME futures even... charging insane margins (over 100% on a LONG position). Others disable BTC futures on the platform.
I can only imagine reaction of the clients when they realize they can't get a piece of the cake. They will create pressure and banks will have to facilitate and lower the margins. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 19:56:48
I'm not worried at all. They will most likely take synthetic exposure to bitcoin for better liquidity (without buying the actual coin), which would drive the price up without giving them any control of the coins or any voting power. I more than welcome price pumping by stupid institutional investors.

In a last few years banks were putting in a quick and dirty "don't deal with anyone dealing with bitcoin" into their policies. This is to cover their ass from the regulators, nothing else. Trust me.

It means the fund will not be available to retail investors. You can invest in it as another mutual fund, hedge fund or wealthy individual.

@_date: 2018-08-22 21:47:31


 
I just wait to see them having to liquidate this pile... this is inevitable. If their investors wanted to be exposed directly to crypto, they would buy crypto. Bitmain's business isn't speculation, it's selling mined coins and hardware to risktakers of the crypto space. Their role is to hedge the risks, not to leverage their exposure.

@_date: 2018-08-22 22:04:09
They only hold a relatively small stash of 22,082 bitcoins - wouldn't move the market by that much. Bitcoin cash holders are those who are really screwed once the BCH coins start hitting the market - more than a million of BCH to liquidate... And Bitmain would certainly have to drop this load sooner or later - they are a hardware-selling business, not a crypto market speculator. Their investors will make them realise that very soon.

Yeah if I wanted to trust a third party to hold virtual bitcoins for me, I'd go with Revolut's "bitcoin" (they're using Visa by the way).
You can get bitcoin within the app and spend from bitcoin balance by using your Revolut card. You don't really own any bitcoins - you can't withdraw them, you can't deposit your own. All they can offer you is exposure to bitcoin price. You pay 1.5% to buy in, an then 1.5% every time you spend in a shop (shop would charge you in any local currency and they'd exchange it automatically - and really ANY local currency, Revolut is meant for travel). If bitcoin moved more than 3% up before you spend (which is common), you are good. Pretty useful in the bull market, when you don't want to keep too much fiat for everyday spending (I mean, still better than holding fiat).
Plus, for the merchant it looks like you're just using an ordinary Visa card, so you don't draw any unwanted attention with a shiny bitcoin logo.

Either way, it's a classic corporate "whoa whoa whoa, careful not to encourage people to buy into this thing or they'll sue" thing.

Maybe, yeah, but I think airports are the most appropriate place for a bitcoin ATM:  
1. At the airport you are relatively anonymous,  
2. There is shitload of security and cameras, so you're not getting mugged,  
3. If you plan to enter or leave the EU with EUR 10 000 euros or more in cash you must declare it to the customs authorities. If you want to carry it anonymously, you just make a bitcoin deposit instead.

Why? Coin split is still possible and exchanges will handle it well. Users who hold their own keys through the fork are responsible to protect themselves from replay risk. It's not that different from the cash fork.

Hello Blackfolio
The pic looks good. I struggle to find a portfolio tracking app that I'd be satisfied with, both from design and function point of view. 
What I miss:  
- source price from multiple exchanges (greater choice)  
- simple, rough exchange rate calculation to local currencies (NOK, SEK, PLN...) - live rates are available everywhere    
- PIN lock  
That's it. Maybe a price widget so I don't have to install two different apps.

Just don't keep it on Coinbase during the fork. They may end up seizing your bitcoins and leaving you with segwit2x (20% of value). They seized all bitcoin cash from people who held their bitcoins there during the last fork. Coinbase is not a trustworthy company.
Major hardare wallet providers (Trezor and Ledger) pride themself with handling forks perfectly. They will develop an easy-to-use and safe coin splitting tool when the time comes. Just make sure you keep your coins deposited on the hardware wallet at the time of coin split. The split occurs with certain block, and after that block two chains emerges. If you keep your private keys (i.e. keep your coins on trezor) you'll own an equal amount of bitcoin 1x and 2x. Just remember not to spend them immediately after the fork, before the splitting tool is develop. since there is no replay protection on the 2x fork, you may end up loosing your tasty 2x profit if you spend from the wallet too soon. First split, then spend.
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:29:34

I hope bitcoin retains its value, but we get a 20% dividend from dummies buying off S2X for a week or two after the fork.

Back in the day, I started from Bitcoin Wiki 
just reading, jumping from article to article to wrap my head around how does it work. Learn about bitcoin core wallet (full client) and how is it different from lite-weight wallets (electrum etc). Learn about security, what is cold storage, what is hardware wallet.
on investing in bitcoin - old r/bitcoin saying: never invest more than you can afford to lose
when you first invest in bitcoin, and the price rises, your ego is through the roof and you think you can outsmart the market (buy low, sell high and repeat). then you'll loose a lot of money, and learn what every r/bitcoin old-timer already knows: buy and hold, through better and worse (in other words, HODL).
a popular r/bitcoin investment strategy is dollar-cost averaging. you invest a fixed dollar amount every 1st day of a month, or every monday. don't look at the price. don't cry and regret. just follow this system automatically. you will look back in a year and enjoy it.
good luck!

Just always check Johoe's mempool before adjusting your fees, to predict what you have to pay for your transaction to get scooped in a decent timeframe.

it depends what you do next.
if you transfer it through some third party service (e.g. exchange) you will essentially launder it from a view of a random person looking at the blockchain. 
if you'll just throw it directly to your bitcoin stash, they can see what you own.
There are also some coin-tumblers. Safer, but probably more expensive. Used mostly for darknet transactions.

This is an interesting stess scenario for crypto in general.  
Ver is forcefully re-directing all hashpower of bitcoin.com pool to mine his side of fork. Meanwhile, the other side is now only one block behind and catching up. The moment SV takes over, miners who were forced to mine on the failed side of chain will be VERY disappointed.
@_date: 2018-11-15 20:51:02
Take a look at BSV block size... 32mb blocks! BCash guys are desperately spamming the BSV network with transactions to slow down block propagation in hopes for orphaned blocks but BSV is still catching up on them.
Not to mention bitcoin.com hashpower is almost entirely re-directed to mine Ver's side of fork, which can't be maintained in the long term. Once SV takes over, Ver's fork is screwed.

I treat the first one more like a cold storage, so I wouldn't be comfortable keeping it around me at all times. The second one I would have for everyday use. You can combine it with android mycelium wallet and pay safely whenever the opportunity comes.  
Backup, yes, but you can still redeem the coins without a second device, so it's not that important.

investment bank world + complex derivatives, v well explained
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:24:49
I'm not sure how it translates into bitcoin situation today. Do we have any exchanges failing on their clients?
The guys in a movie are holding derivatives that are essentially insurance on certain debt securities not defaulting. the problem is, the party which guarantees the payout in case of default on debt (usually a bank), will not be able to meet its obligations under the derivative contract. this is why the guys are thinking about selling these contracts they gave with banks, on a market, for 15 cents on a dollar, because it is unlikely they would receive a full guarantee in case of default.
it would be a better match with MtGox situation, where people would start dealing in "Gox coins" - their rights to their bitcoins stuck on the exchange, before they knew what actually happened and how many bitcoins were left. Some third parties would buy these rights to bitcoins for a small percentage of the actual bitcoin value.

Did you just come up with this date out of the blue? Gold was in use long before 1000 AD and "paper money", or banknotes, were introduced much later. USD banknotes were backed by gold until 1971. Since then, their value is based on trust (to issuer=Fed and to merchants accepting it).

He is bcash and s2x supporter just to build his bitcoin persona. He has no technical talent or knowledge, so he has to take controversial/illogical stance on every big bitcoin issue. He thinks he is a genious just because he put all of his money in bitcoin very early, and didn't sell it all when the panic hit. But he doesn't get attention he think he deserves, because people who know him long enough, realize there is nothing behind his quick loud talk. I suppose it still pays him well. He's getting invited to do a lot of talks to layman, who hear about bitcoin for the first time, and don't yet realize this guy is a crook.

Would make sense for him to take an adversarial position on issue, just to stay in the lights for a little longer.

UBS Swiss bank actually announced recently crypto coin developed for inter-bank FX settlement. It's gonna have backing 1:1 in fiat currency stored in central banks.. of course under control of a regulator. 6 major investment banks are already on board. 
This guy is probably talking about wealth management clients (individuals with 50 million+ in net worth, bank invests their money). Normal thing they're looking to get exposure to crypto currencies. For individual like these, I think ETF would be a great opportunity to get this exposure - easy to managed by any bank, easy situation with taxes. That's just for a small % fee on the actual coin gains.

yes, but you have an option to adjust it manually (even to 0). You can just check the mempool and see if it is a good time to pay a much lower fee.  
To my best knowledge, no android wallet has this option available, which is a shame. I understand the worry that newbies might start sending transactions with no fees at all, but they should leave an option to adjust for advanced users. Current applications are pumping the fees unnecessarily. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:12:28

***You can't order physical delivery of bitcoin, like you can gold -*** why would you. you can OWN it totally in your memory. Just remember your private key seed.
having said that, I agree that Gold is probably the second best asset type (after major cryptocurrencies) you can buy right now, given the looming equity market sell-off
@_date: 2017-09-06 13:22:21
no, they have a minimum that can't be overwritten (right now 0.00039/kB = USD 1.76), while now, with empty mempool, you can easily make a transaction with one satoshi/kB (USD 0.00004523). Shit like this makes bitcoin unusable.
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:04:48
Bitcoin core will keep being supported on most exchanges as bitcoin. Segwit2x coin will be added as an altcoin, and as such, priced at a small % of bitcoin core. Miners will quickly realize mining bitcoin core is more profitable and will switch back. Core development will continue. S2X project will be abandoned.
