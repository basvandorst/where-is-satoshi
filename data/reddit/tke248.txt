I sent you some more details in a pm, its has no HOA currently zoned for high density residential but could be used for anything mostly commercial property on two sides and backs up to a residential area.  There is another 5 acre track next to this one if you need more space.

Thanks for the advice but my wife says its got to go held it for a year and didn't end up doing anything with it yet, except pay the tax bill.

Well my though is that bullets have gone up in price something like 260% in the past 10 years, so they could be traded/sold as a commodity or if shit hits the fan used to acquire goods or keep people from acquiring mine.  I too hope never to find out but....

I think bullets have intrinsic value and are a good place to store wealth

Is it hard to get uncirculated bills and is it illegal to ship them out of the country?  For that cheap it would make a neat monopoly set!

This guys video explains how to do it ok 
Basically you encrypt your private key and send me your already encrypted key which I generate the QR code with to make your card.  Since its encrypted the only person it would be useful to is the person who know the pass phrase

I making simple plastic credit cards

If the private is encrypted it doesn't matter but enough people have mentioned it that I'm thinking about changing it, thanks for the input

Yea its possible I made the first card to scratch my own itch and posted it on another cypto sub which seemed to get some love which made me create the site to keep track of the orders that were coming in.  The raw materials are cheap its just a matter of systematizing the process it to cut down on the labor costs site is 3 days old...
