I'm sorry, I can't help there. I tried it for a little while and came out under. The lesson for me was I can't time the market so I decided long ago to buy and hold my position. Now I'm in the long term gains tax bracket. But I'm not ever getting out so there's no taxable event.

I actually heard a really interesting one on YouTube that my buddy sent me the other day. It's kind of been in the back of my head. I'm sure there's plenty of evidence against this theory, but it does make you think. Money, value store and transactional data could be the universal language. 
Edit: After watching it again, it goes to a dark place about "they" and the shadow elites creating it. That seems unlikely. If anything, it could just be the next logical step after creating AI, for the AI to create a universal language. Purely entertainment value, as I am not fearful of the next step in evolution.

Hopefully it will drop eventually, just like the value does. And you don't need it to confirm immediately. I'm waiting to make my transactions. In the meantime I'm moving the rest of my crypto.

There was some of those little miners that Amazon was selling for a while... Like 120G/hs or something. Tiny little guys but you can get in a pool and see how it works. I don't think they even cover the transaction fees though.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:41:48
While anonymity is important for security, it is NOT the goal of cryptocurrency. 
Peer to peer transactions is the goal - simple. This is achieved through a transparent ledger, open source software and consensus.
And it's not a matter of needing the technology. Bitcoin is about freedom and governance through consensus. Bigger picture homie.

Wouldn't buying more and creating demand affect a short negatively?
@_date: 2018-09-06 09:16:07
Lots of ifs, but here's my answer:
If all bitcoin is to you is trading and a quick buck, a bear market is probably rough, especially for the little guy or the guy who got in close to the top. If you took out an equity line to buy in December, things probably don't look so good.
If you are buying bitcoin to use as a currency for day to day transactions, it's not a big deal because you probably don't have much anyway  - your balance is revolving. 
If, however, bitcoin is a long term store of value, a bear market is an opportunity to grab some more at a discount. Cost averaging over the long term because savings is created over the long term, 10 years or more.
Those of us in the later category, we're watching with excitement, not fear, and improving security for the savings we've accumulated. The fearful, the uninformed and the greedy probably see a downward spiral.

I disagree when you say it's none of those things for the following reasons:
Immutability isn't mentioned in the whitepaper but it is immutable. And while freedom and democracy aren't mentioned, the code is outlined in the whitepaper and because it's open source, your decision to run the code is a vote for it.
- If you control any private keys on the blockchain, you are voting yes on the code.
- If you run a node, you are voting yes on code.
- If you secure the network by mining, you are voting yes on the code.
There are only two votes: Yes or No. Anything other than Yes is a No. All votes count, even the No votes.
Unlike the US govt structure (a pseudo/representative democracy), if you don't vote, you still participate in it. And even though the consensus may vote for one candidate, another may be chosen. The US govt (through the Federal Reserve), controls its currency, not the voters. The voters in the bitcoin democracy, however, do control their currency.
I think that is true democracy and true freedom. The "truest" up until now anyway...
@_date: 2018-08-25 08:08:26
Well said. Bitcoin is true freedom, democracy by consensus and everyone's vote counts.

Ok, maybe my math is screwy but here's what I have come up with: 200 GH/S costs $30. After a year, that will generate approx $47. But Genesis also charges a .00028 USD fee per GH/s, per day. For 200 GH/s, that's .056 usd or $20~ per year. After a year, the contract will produce $27~ (which is $3 less than the initial investment). You break even with this contract month 13 and then you start making money. 
Does the maintenance fee get locked into the contract?

38% is a hefty "trimming". Hypothetically speaking;
I sold my 1 btc 6 months ago for $10,000 minus Uncle Sam's cut of $3,800 leaving me with $6,200. 
Lucky for me, bitcoin has retracted 50% and I take that $6,200 and buy 1.24 bitcoin. 
As an investor, the logic you suggest is to use an oracle to decide when to trade in and out of the market. 
1a. What market indicators, tools, charts, search terms, tea leaves, etc are you using to decide in or out? 
1b. What indicators help you determine the top/bottom of the market?
2. Do you have a verifiable "wallet", balance, trade history or anything to verify the success of your strategy thus far?
3. Do I need you to make my decision or can I use the tools you use?
4. Does your strategy account for capital gains/losses?
5. How much would the crypto currency need to depreciate then re-appreciate in order to break even?
After expelling all of the energy that your strategy requires, does the risky potential gain (24%) justify taking the potential risk of missing out on the next moon? My initial thought is to keep using my strategy of dollar cost averaging and grow the 24% by saving but I'm open to new ideas.
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:53:00
Oooooh, I get it now. You're probably trolling, haven't actually done it and got the idea with a buddy while stoned. 
Either way, good luck with all of that. I think you'll make more money selling your oracle abilities than trading bitcoin but I hope you find success.

@_date: 2018-11-13 03:48:41
Two questions: 
1. You're proposing the stash of "premined" bitcoin Satoshi kept is a backdoor, but if that stash was released, wouldn't that mean that the value of bitcoin was zero (because they gave it away)? And once it's held on to, because of the sheer size of the stash, it can never be let go. Any release of the funds would drop the price significantly. The only solution is to burn the coins.
2. What is the "inevitable global financial crisis" you're talking about? Every dip seems like a crisis to someone. The money/value already created by humans isn't going to disappear right? A financial crisis is just money moving, not money being burned. 
Finally; your post was really interesting to read. About halfway through I almost thought you were higher than a kite.

I think there's a use case for both. Proof of work to create value. Proof of stake to use the value created to stake other endeavors. 
While it does reward early adoption, early adopters are required to lock their value.
In the case of Ethereum, early adopters can lock their stake to secure the network but if the network's value (or Ether) goes to zero, the investor gets nothing in return. 
It seems just as risky as mining to me.

A lot of people that work for a living also have some sort of investment strategy too... Like IRA, 401k, pension, etc. Those all represent proof of stake where an investor stakes a company or a government entity or some variation. 
Realistically, the planet should only need to sustain one proof of work chain while the rest can be proof of stake.
