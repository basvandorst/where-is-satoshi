Who cares? If that were the truth you would literally always be making money (relative to fiat) with every dollar that you put in. This is not a bad problem to have.

I think this will open the door to price manipulation by big institutions.

I apologize if I talk myself in circles here but...
You say each one produces a unique hash output...
Does that mean if both person A and Person B chose the same input they will each get a different output or the same output?
I ask this because if there are so many computers working at the same time they must be trying the same inputs, meaning the fastest computer would Always win.

What's this!? Actual sound advice??? Gtfo with that nonsense!!!
But seriously this is what every person should do whether they hate the banks or not...

I asked the other commenter this as well, but will the initial guess always be the same at the start of each block? Or will the initial guess just be random each block.

Buy Monero.

This is bad news for bitcoin I think. Derivatives make the entire market much more of a target for big money manipulation.
Just look into max pain for options contracts and you'll see what I'm getting at.

Thanks so much for your help. This is starting to clear things up.
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:32:41
Yes. I want to understand if they choose randomly or systematically.
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:51:36
So the block will be different depending on who mines it then correct?
Btw thank you for your detailed response.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:07:17
This is the only answer.
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:12:03
So I guess my question is kinda like this...
Let's say the solution is a number 1-100.
Does the CPU always start at 1 and work it's way up? Or will it start at 5 for the first block then guess a random number that's not 5.  Then on the next block it will start at 17 etc...

The only thing close to digital gold at this point is Monero. Bitcoin isn’t fungible. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:11:54
Like someone else just commented gold is 100% fungible. It can always be melted down and has no history.
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:09:00
I would disagree. Something is either fungible or it isn’t. I’m a bitcoin fan. I very much believe in it, but I still wouldn’t consider it fungible when you have “tainted” coins that sell for less or can get you locked out of Coinbase, etc...

lol I was gonna say
That's the strangest qrs I've ever seen
