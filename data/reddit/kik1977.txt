Agree with you, but don't forget Bitcoin-24, different situation, sure, but funds returned.

As I said, not judging.. and anyway, no one would deserve any threat due to his/her opinion which are free to be expressed!

Is the class action lawsuit open to anyone even if not from the USA?

Take into account that maybe you write a quick email differently from a paper on which you have been working for years! Especially if you are not a native speaker.

Today I checked my paper wallets against the blockchain and found none of them were stolen. Can't say the same for the few 
ones I had on Gox :)

Hi! I've recently conducted a training programme in Kathmandu and, among other things, I talked about Bitcoin. I found a general lack of knowledge about it, unlike other countries. I understood they have no idea of what Bitcoin is. As suggested by others, if you want to succeed you should first create awareness, maybe through free classes, possibly in a place with good internet connection (I remember a nice italian pizzeria in Kathmandu with a good connection). Once this awareness is spread, you could operate (depending on the local legislation you might have to register as an exchange) as a local exchange for btw-to-rupees. Good luck!
