It looks like it's a real address. I PM'd it to you, it's also in screenshots below.

That is correct, I see nothing.
How on earth might this have happened?

Here's what happened:
-It was a strange brain fart on my part. I searched through my email and found an old confirmation from a looong time ago from blockchain wallet that I forgot I made (in my Firefox browser) when I first read about bitcoin and hadn't though about really trying it) on. Today, my friend was on my computer and left a Firefox browser open, but I made my blockchain wallet in Chrome. I completely didn't think about that, and I didn't notice that the identifier field (populated from old cookies, I guess) was different. I logged into bitinstant, and copy-pasted. When I got home later, I opened Chrome, logged into the wallet with the identifier that pops up in Chrome, and logged in, thinking it was the same wallet. 
Thanks a bunch for mentioning a second account, I never even considered that or I might have remembered that old one. Bitcoins are safe.

You're right about the free lesson. I did get a good laugh though when I realized what had happened. 
Thanks again for that. The solution was so simple that it was genius.

I only see the one either inactive or archived.
Here are screenshots of relevant details.

I logged into my blockchain.info wallet, copied the address, and pasted in the field on bitinstant. I wouldn't have the first clue how I may have entered some other random address.
Well the time thing is a relief then. The account number is worrysome. Thanks for the reply.
