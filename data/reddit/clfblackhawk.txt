I am definitely going to try it out just for shits and gigs.  I do the same thing with my Minecraft world saves.  Makes it so convenient to be able to play any world, have it auto save, and then pick it back up on my desktop when I get home, or vice versa.  Never had any problems.  
@_date: 2013-03-25 21:12:56
Amen.  And add BUY.
@_date: 2013-03-26 21:02:37
Ok, cool.  Thank you for the response!
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:29:06


So instead of having a 1,000x payout when the odds to win are 1,000,000 to 1, you get a 500x payout.  Sounds awesome!! /s

Maybe try making a backup and restoring it in a client, and sending it from there?
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:26:15
A nice set of speakers, ~$400.  So I want to make sure the transaction is safe.  It would be nice to use Bitcoins -&gt; giftcard to prevent extra fees and delays of an ACH credit to my account, but I don't wanna take the risk of being ripped off.  
@_date: 2013-03-07 21:53:31
It can't be rigged.  You can verify the lucky numbers in the transaction number.  Your sample size is far too small to be making speculations that Satoshi Dice is rigged.  
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:12:38
I was trying to buy over the weekend at ~$34, but bitinstant is still down!  Hopefully this is a sign the price will drop and the wait was worth it.  I am way too afraid to buy now.

@_date: 2013-03-25 20:17:32


I think you answered your own question.  Don't try to predict the market.  If you are comfortable holding long term, just buy when you can.  
@_date: 2013-03-27 18:50:17
Yes, you lock in the price.
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:07:39
If you are going to boast about tricking everyone, at least inform those you did so they know what misconceptions they might have had. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 21:11:42
I'd say there is going to be some steady growth/stable prices for a while.  I personally don't see a correction being made for a while, due to all the hype.  If you wanna buy in, at least wait for the weekend, as there is usually a small drop, as seen this past weekend and most others.  But then again, even with the weekend drop, it could be higher than the ~$75.80 it is at now.

Do people actually fall for this kind of stuff...?
Edit:  I guess if people will fall for the Nigerian prince, they can fall for anything ;)

Make sure you deduct the .0005 transaction fee from what you want to transfer.  So if you want to transfer 10 BTC, transfer 9.9995 BTC instead.  That might allow it to go through.
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:09:36
That sucks.  What bank are you with?  Are you in the US?  Luckily I haven't had any problems so far, but I have only made one purchase.  I wonder what causes an account to be marked as risky...
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:41:06
I was able to get about 5, I was spamming the purchase button for 5 minutes and NO I did not have to refresh the page.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:55:38


As it is the same price it was at 24 hours ago.....
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:14:45
I am probably going to sell some soon.  Definitely not all, but I have made enough now where I can easily sell what I originally invested in USD.  I have my eyes on some new speakers for my room.
EDIT:  I think a lot of people tend to forget how risky Bitcoin still is.  For a lot of us, we want to materialize at least SOME of this unbelievable return.  Then again, I am lowering my return.  It all comes down to your risk preference.  
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:29:53
Exactly.  I personally don't ever think Bitcoin will ever become "The Base" or whatever. I think at most it will dominate a large part of internet transactions and be used in global transactions.  However, I do feel this will allow it to become large and stable enough to be used as some type of real currency, and not just a means of investment and speculation.  
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:44:25
Yup, I think it all comes down to a matter of convenience, preference and perceived security threat.  I would be afraid to make a paper wallet because I might lose it, throw it away, etc.  And an offline wallet on a Virtual Box or linux box is just too much of a hassle for me, as I would go insane with making back ups and what not.  Plus, I like the idea of being able to access my wallet anywhere in the world if I really need to.  To each their own.

@_date: 2013-03-22 21:51:12
Nice! In this case, the lag worked to our advantage.  MtGox already showed a rebound to $69 by the time I was able to buy, and the price at Coinbase was still at $66.20.  That made for an easy decision.  
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:56:15


@_date: 2013-04-03 18:12:47
@_date: 2013-03-25 21:26:46
Day to day? I am no where good enough to make those predictions.  I tried a few times to time it and got burned.  Especially since Mt. Gox lags hard when there is a run.  The window is only open for 10-15 minutes and prices rebound quick.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:28:51
I'm hoping payments aren't converted at [this]( sell price on their site... 
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:48:18
That doesn't eliminate the thousands who are speculating and using it primarily as a means of investment.  I don't see how this is proof there isn't a bubble...
@_date: 2013-03-05 18:20:16
Price should shoot up further.  I am trying to get linked with coinbase, hopefully I can buy in 2 days.  I'll probably buy half of what I want to invest, wait the other half to see what happens.
@_date: 2013-03-26 20:09:26


@_date: 2013-03-22 16:56:51
It is scary accurate, too...
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:32:12
Haha! Yes, I bought at about $48 once coinbase linked to my account.  I am more than happy with the return so far!  
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:17:17
You aren't losing $1,000.  You are doing the right thing.  Those do not belong to you ;) Bravo for doing the right thing.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:28:50
Yup.  We will get there eventually.  It is unfortunate for those who bought in so high.  Luckily I got in at $48 and cashed out my original investment when it doubled, so it is basically house money to me.  For me, this roller coaster ride has been quite exciting and a great learning experience.

My first time sending a tip! Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:22:30
Wait till there is 8,468,486,185 seconds of lag on MtGox, then the price will plummet.  
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:27:33
Why this over btcbuy.info if it is pretty much the same service?  It seems going thro Bitmit is more of a hassle.  Do they have a better rep?
@_date: 2013-03-26 20:05:22
Agreed, it's nice seeing something usable and nice for bitcoins.  Most websites look shoddy.
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:17:02
Fuck hindsight.
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:30:12
So any game is double? Regardless of spread and everything?  Brb while I put all my BTC in 1 seed teams.  Something seems wrong here..
Edit: Can anyone confirm the legitimacy of this site?
@_date: 2013-03-30 18:08:23
Apparently nothing can decrease volatility... we're screwed.
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:59:03
Agreed, I'd just dump 1 BTC in all 1 seed teams and gimme games.  Easy money.
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:30:04
Just got 5 coins at Coinbase for 66.20 USD/BTC!! Talk about spamming the purchase button.  
@_date: 2013-03-07 20:56:59
I would most definitely encrypt.  This wouldn't be my main mode of storage, however.  Just something to store a few coins in that can stay synced between my computers.  If my Google account is breached, I have bigger problems to worry about than a couple BTC.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:52:47
Nope.  That is way too big of a loss to incur.  If you can wait a year or two, or however long it takes for the price to recover to ~$170, I would wait.  I think most of us will agree Bitcoin still has a good future ahead of it.  I personally believe it will get back to $170 no problem, the question isn't if it will, it is when it will.  
Think about the financial crisis of 07-08.  The Stock Market crashed big, and people who got scared and sold incurred HUGE losses.  If they would have stayed in, they would have recovered 100% of the loss by now, and even made some. 
Of course, all this advice is terrible if Bitcoin fails and never recovers, and that is another risk you have to take.  It is up to you to determine how strong the fundamentals are and determine the future value of Bitcoin.  Whatever you do though, don't regret the choice.  Stick with it, learn from it, and be happy with your choice.

Cool article, but I want more! Way more!'
Edit: It just kinda ended, and then I got sad.

It says any bets after the game has started will be considered a donation.  Be careful.

Ya, I have never seen it though.  Wonder how much better it is...
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:21:54
I just wished some of these sites didn't look so shoddy.... I may give this site a try.
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:55:45
Ya, who knows how it works... Just gotta spam it.
@_date: 2013-03-23 21:53:10
Great idea!
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:23:01
And because we are still FAR off from feeling truly wealthy by just holding Bitcoins.  If no one should buy dollars and it really is so inferior, then why are we pricing Bitcoins in dollars?  Bitcoins would be nothing if merchants and investors couldn't liquidate their holdings into the currency of their choice.  Everyone's bills need to be paid with fiat, and it will be a long time before that changes.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:31:39
Happened to my friend today.  Kinda a blessing actually with the price drop.

@_date: 2013-04-08 17:37:39
I honestly don't think so.  I have all of my coins held there.  If you are using a strong 10+ character password and secondary password, along with 2 form authentication, I really don't see there being a problem.  
* 2 form authentication prevents them from getting into your account
* If they can get into your account, secondary password should stop them from spending, unless they can somehow also get that password, but you use an on screen keyboard for that one which will prevent loggers.
* If wallets are taken, it is encrypted with your super duper secure password.  Blockchain would hopefully notify you of this.  Recover your backup in a local client and transfer the coins WAY before it can ever be cracked by hackers.  
I trust it.  If something goes wrong, it is honestly probably your own fault.  And please, somebody correct me if I am wrong on any of these points.
@_date: 2013-03-06 19:32:44
Well, of course this is a valid point.  I would hope most people recognize this is a highly volatile and risky investment.  Some people love risk, others don't.  I wouldn't invest just for the opportunity to strike it rich, there has to be some underlying value there, which is hard to say what that is going to be right now.  Everyone will have differing views on the actual value and therefore will have different preferences on how much they are willing to invest.  
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:22:28
Well, best of luck.  Hope everything goes through fine.  I can't wait for the  whole process through Coinbase to speed up.  Waiting 6 days is a little crazy.
