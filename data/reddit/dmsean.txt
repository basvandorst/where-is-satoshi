That's like saying gold failed right? Well during famines it didn't matter how much gold you had, you still can't eat gold. You can't eat bitcoin.
The purpose of bitcoin is to provide transactions in a market. If there is no market, no bitcoin did not fail, but it is still worthless.

Well, it's not the direction but the situation that is negative. The act of a serf rebelling against his feudal lord may not be negative, but the fact he has to still is.

Totally true, but is that an example of racism or nationalism? They happened to be white Americans in a upper class during the 60's. They might have been racist, but was it racism making them help other nations or nationalistic pride?
Racism requires you to hate a particular selection of humans, class warfare makes you believe in a subservient class. Nationalism doesn't necessarily have to hate anything, and the only positive hate it could have would be say another nation threatening its sovereignty.

Racism, nationalism and class warfare.
Pretty much all the same things in my book in many ways. 
Inherently though, racism and class warfare can pretty much only be viewed negatively as a whole for the human race. Nationalism on the other hand, while it can be abused, can be viewed positively. For example (although no longer true) Canada use to pride itself nationaly on being peacekeepers. Best education system in the world being a nationalist pride? Is it for patriots only or does it export knowledge? (in the case historically of America for example).

You don't have to regulate bitcoin to pursue a criminal negligence charge against this company. Current laws would work.

I'm curious if a EULA has actually ever been used in court.

dunno about that...those fake weed ads would probably sell there. A lot of dumb teens end up on that site (first time I visited erowid was when I was 15....but I think it's the fact these drug users have "morals.

Yup. There is all sorts of room for abuse here. I've heard of paypal holding money hostage all the time, because it looks *suspicious*.

I thought by the end they change the plan and the gold was worthless compared to cryptography?
Might be wrong. Might just be confirmation bias at work.

I'd really wonder what usury laws are in the Qur'an that completely contradict bitcoin. I know they'd have some issue with it.

I think it would be this line: "Investing in businesses that provide goods or services considered contrary to Islamic principles is also haraam ("sinful and prohibited")" 
My surface knowledge on currency exchange seems to be that they are ok with it as long as it is a fiat currency.
The Islamic Bank of Bitcoin seems to be applying Islamic banking financials to bitcoin (profit sharing, free interests loans), but it doesn't address the fact that investing in bitcoin is investing in markets contrary to islamic belief.

I don't see why we have to believe any form of money is responsible for the actions of individuals. As long as the money is free and decentralized, only society can be blamed for what transactions occur.
IS HSBC any less guilty then SR?

I work for a POS company that sells POS devices all over north america. America has some fucked up complicated as fuck tax codes. 
If it was easy, I assure you it would exist as a neatly wrapped product. As is, fuck everything about California taxes.
I'd also say tax software companies have every interest in keeping the tax code as complicated as possible.

I think it's important to downplay the impact of SR on bitcoin by comparing it to other centralized monetary policies that do nothing to curb the sale of drugs.
HSBC was sued 2 billion dollars for laundering drug money. 
I could argue there are certain countries that wouldn't even have weapons or a monetary policy if not for the CIA laundering drug money for them as well. 
So drugs have been an important aspect of finical growth even for USD. Soft wood lumber failing in BC? Now everyone up north grows indoor cannabis and ships it over the border for cocaine and because of that our economy didn't fall apart like a lot of people predicted (also why housing prices in this province are extremely high in a place like abbotsford and mission, 2 hours from any major job centers, yet a 3 bedroom house still costs $400k)
