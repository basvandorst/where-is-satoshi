I'm confused by your comment. You do know that, regardless of the money thrown at stopping torrents by governments and industries, they are still available everywhere right?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:25:50
Yes of course, just like the government's around the world made torrents illegal, and we all lost all our torrents.

Well, I can't write torrent sites here, or at least I think so, but I can direct you to an excellent blog,

The largest futures company is starting a futures bitcoin today. That means all the people who want in but don't have the knowledge will be able to invest in bitcoin. I agree I would have waited until the end of next week.

Good point, but just a couple of weeks ago I was talking Bitcoin with a close friend who actually manages a fund and has several customers. When I asked why he is not adding Bitcoin to his customers portfolios, he told me in black and white that he needed it to be integrated on his terminal and also to have accountability in case of failure. Meaning if something happens to his customers bitcoins he needed to sue someone somewhere in order to deflect accountability.

If you meant last Sunday that was a much smaller company selling the futures, this Sunday enters the market the biggest one in the world. But it's always a possibility that nothing will happen in the very short term.

Does a bigger block means a less distributed network?
@_date: 2014-12-12 16:44:19
Hahaha. It's fantastic. The only minor flaw is lack of apps!

Zhenli Ye Gon, ephedrine traficker and businessman in Mexico City. Look for it in Wikipedia for the complete story. By no means has the size of el Chapó business.

Exactly the same thing that prevents newspapers to have their own Facebook/Twitter plataform. Or the same thing that prevented block buster to have it's own Netflix or exactly the same thing that is preventing Walmart to have its own Amazon plataform.

That was found in a house in one of Mexico's City richest neighborhoods.

Agree to disagree, we will see. RemindMe! 5 years.

Ok. Tell us, who is Assange?

OK, who else is doing Assanges work right?

Torrents haven't been legal for decades in the US, billions have been spent worldwide trying to stop them. I wouldn't worry about the US being able to stop crypto while they can't stop something much less valuable. The government knows it, that's why instead of banning it they are regulating it.
I stand corrected, torrents are legal, sharing IP with them is illegal. The governments have been trying to stop it and haven't been able to. It still applies for crypto, while they might make crypto illegal, they can't stop people from sharing bits and bytes on the internet.

That's interesting, what's your main asset in your crypto portfolio if I may ask?
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:09:26
I agree with you, I used to talk to people about Bitcoins great opportunity, now I don't talk about it unless someone asks a specific question. At this point it seems like the finance establishment is starting to worry and the attacks will be more directed. But if the Cryptos survive the Banks will definitely take a big hit in their income.

For me Bitcoin is about getting assets out of the hands of the government. They can sue me all they want, they can put me in jail for any invented reason. But they won't be able to touch my assets or my capability to transfer them to whoever I want as long as I own the key. The banks won't be able to offer that because their blockchain will be tied to their relationship with governments.

You seem like you understand bitcoin. Please consider helping me to answer this question. If my goal is to use bitcoin as a place to save money out of the hands of banks and government, what should I choose BU or SegWit?
@_date: 2017-04-13 22:27:31
Thank you. So in short this is a problem between miners. Users as me should do nothing at all? Choose a new wallet or cold storage perhaps?
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:30:55
I disagree, we have the means for transaction solved in many ways like fiat, credit cards, debit cards, paypal, money transfers, etc. What we need is a place to save money out of the hands of corrupt institutions, and when I say corrupt I mean public and private ones.

The very reason for cryptocurrency existing is that no one can regulate them. What you are asking for would destroy it. Governments will try to regulate it, but at the end the cryptocurrency wich can defend itself from them will prevail.

I definitely would not call my daughter "formerly smart", He is a bad person and I think his top priority by far in his life is making money regardless of colateral damage.

Are you kidding? Governments can't stop Torrents, sex services, drugs, fire arms, etc. What makes you think they'll be able to stop Crypto currencys? Are you going to tell me that drugs, for example, lack mass adoption because they are illegal? I see crypto currencys going the same route as alcohol, getting banned at first, then governments realizing it's impossible and adopting it with a regulation framework.
@_date: 2019-09-14 12:09:42
I see Crypto as a way to store wealth. In fact, that's how I use it now. There are other more efficient ways to buy stuff (cash, credit cards).
Fiat is always at the mercy of central banks and governments to be stolen or confiscated in the long run. I see crypto more in the line of replacing gold and treasury bonds than cash.

Why? Because contrary to our believes most of the world can function without the help of the west? You would be amazed of what is happening in China right now in every aspect of life.

Ideas are owned by humanity. Are you paying someone to use fire to cook your meals?
@_date: 2015-03-28 22:52:03
I think governments will be able to control cryptocurrency as much as they can control social networks. They will try, but they will also fail.
@_date: 2015-03-28 21:01:23
Yes. But what happens when Walmart, amazon or ebay accepts bitcoin? Or it's common for most people to have bitcoin? Then suddenly everybody is exchanging stuff for bitcoin without having to convert to fiat.
