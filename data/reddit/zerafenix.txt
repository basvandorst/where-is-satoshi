Brian, Please fix my 100 BTC order 3 weeks ago!!!
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:09:06
Yea. like 30 days ago. Apparently he went through his period and forgot all about it.
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:12:27
I like how you're always on my posts. Why don't you find something better to do? For example, like treating yourself to a nice GO KILL YOURSELF BY JUMPING OFF A CLIFF smoothie would be ggreeeaaaAAAATTTTTTTT!
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:01:56
I'll look into this. I believe what you're talking about is "structuring", which is illegal in the United States the last time I read about it.
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:44:17
Not anymore. they changed it apparently. I bought 50 BTC on two separate days, one after the other. so a total of 100 BTC I bought at $200 a pop. Had to wait like 4-5 days for it to get into my account. Was pretty stoked, before an hr or so before it was due to arrive into my account, high risk :/
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:30:29
go away troll
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:31:26
How much BTC did you buy?
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:47:52
Olaf enough with the bullshitting. Why don't you respond to my messages anymore on reddit you liar?
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:46:12
Fucking jackass.
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:20:25
well yea. i mean, tbh. 2 weeks gone by. too stressing to like think about it. so i'm toning down all cylinders and just taking a light tone on all this to get the word out to not only help myself, but everyone in the same boat as me. everyone wins on the boat wins! :) ...hopefully lol
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:22:03
You're one of the funniest trolls I've ever seen around. We should become friends.
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:11:56
He's a troll. Don't listen to him lol.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:57:01
Calm down.
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:51:55
I don't owe them anything so I have no idea.
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:57:33
Well I didn't buy 10 btc. I bought 100 BTC over 2 days 50 BTC each day cuz 50 btc every 24 hrs is the limit for lvl 2 verified members.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:34:51
Interesting. Still doesn't make what I do illegal. Honestly didn't even know what structuring was until you just told me. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:49:49
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:11:04
Like I said to someone else below, if this was their business model in disguise, no one would deal with them, because that would be a pretty screwed up business model. (albeit I did use a more profane word in place of screwed up because I'm still pretty pissed off)
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:26:49
I'm proactive.
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:02:49
At the moment, I have every right to say they have ripped me off. $7k I could've pocketed gone.
And am I jumping to conclusion? As of NOW I'm out $7k, and ripped off. That's not speculation. And note that I posted this:
"I'm not going to speculate on why they did this although most of you can suspect why." That's speculation. I'm not bashing anyone yet and not making any final judgments yet.
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:35:27
Oh I see. lol. Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:36:42
They just need to get their act together. That's all.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:14:28
You're funny.
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:14:55
Lol just shut the fuck up teslaburn. You know the scenario, don't go changing it idiot.
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:30:28
I'm not new. I'm level 2 verification. I've been registered for a few months already. and I've done over $6k transactions. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:59:00
I've read over there ToS. It's very greyish and not clear.
This is another person that had the same issue but got his bitcoins at the original price. So I presume that coinbase should know the right thing to do.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:56:36
Yea pretty much. They can go fuck themselves hard. They're getting counter sued so bad they wish they took back all of their bullshit threats against me. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:12:05
Scammed? I'm going to take legal action against a REAL company if things don't pan out the way I want it to. Scammed these days sound more like little kids getting lured on runescape.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:53:52
It's fine. Anything I post is going to get downvoted anyways so I don't see the fucking point. Thanks for the downvote sir.
I'd rather have him sue me, because I'll be getting $500k :)
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:05:21
hahahaha that's pretty funny. what a coicidence. What's up with Coinbase wanting to sue people lately? I'm still waiting for that "mail" that they've threatened to send me for over a month already. I'm pretty pissed because I want them to sue me but this mail isn't getting to me! I mean, free money in my pocket I DON'T MIND! :)
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:17:39
It's the same issue lol. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:00:49
Yes. If you're a new member and who's likely a fraud. For someone like him who's a legitimate user who's done transactions before, you STILL think they have the right to decide not to process your transaction? If you were Coinbase, and I was a loyal customer of yours who's done business with you in the past, and you throw this shit at me, prepare your anus for a lawsuit.
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:20:50
You REALLY think that will happen? YOU come on. I'm level 2 verification. I've done deals in the thousands with them already. Seems either like a fucking coincidence, or a fucking coincidence.
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:29:57
lol same shit happened to me: 
Something fishy is going on.
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:44:25
I totally agree. Hence I haven't exploded.....just yet.
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:24:05
I'm the US and this is far by the easiest way to buy bitcoins in my opinion.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:11:34
They ripped him off plain and simple. It's a contract. They have to honor it. If they can decide when to not process transactions for anyone, then that is a FAIL business model and NO ONE will want to do business with Coinbase anymore.
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:14:46
I'll look into this. But the fact that I haven't gotten any really informative information from their support desk for 2 weeks straight really scares me.
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:28:33
Hey Brian. Why don't you respond to my tweets?
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:39:39
Finally, someone who truly acknowledges the logical nature of my claim. Thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:23:16
Doesn't mean shit eh? Means total shit in my eyes. Anything negative, especially to the thousands, means you're a troll and the words that trolls say in my eyes are equivalent to a bag of gorilla shit.
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:37:52
I'll look into that issue though I doubt it was because of my bank. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:45:13
You make me laugh. If they relied on this business off of refusing to deal with anyone at their own whim at any time, then they need to fucking change their business model. If this was the business model like you said it was, perfectly fine according to you, being a level 2 verified member who has done over $6k deals with them, then I have every right to sue them. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:21:50
2 weeks. lol
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:32:53
Whatever their reasons were, I'd love to know.
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:43:09
How does reality hurt? You're a troll who's trolling me and hence I shouldn't be taking you seriously. If any, it should hurt for you because you seriously have no life.
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:35:10
I hope so.
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:13:33
I just want them to sue me already. &gt;.&lt; I want to buy that awesome mansion they have on sale in Waikiki, Honolulu!!!!!
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:04:34
Most certainly. Go fuck yourself.
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:14:50
lol I know right. Sometimes the truth isn't pretty.
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:55:59
Just laughed my head off. Taking you to court over 5 cents. LMAO!
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:59:37
You are blind.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:58:30
Talk about that, I need to message Olaf when the court mail is arriving to my house. lol brb.
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:53:07
hahaha thanks! Let's get this up there! Woot woot!
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:31:31
EDIT: Clicking on your name reveals that you have included the words "Fuck" and "idiot" in around 99% of your posts. You seriously have no life.
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:00:50
You're not the judge. You're the only one being the bigot here.
EDIT: Listen. I clicked on you and you're also a troll. -1,641 comment karma. haha....
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:17:27
I've noticed. :)
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:30:55
and you just got downvoted. leave troll.
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:25:20
Right. Which pisses me off even more. Good point.
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:18:00
It's fine. I told you I don't care. They know the scenario. Posting evidence would lower the chances of the suit going through.
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:03:04
If you want proof, I can live stream it. But then again, all you redditors don't give a shit anyways and will just downvote for the sick fun of it.
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:50:51
yea sorry about it....lol
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:00:35
I bought it around 2 weeks ago. And it got cancelled like right when it was about to be released into my account.
@_date: 2013-11-16 00:23:23
Why do you keep ignoring me Olaf? Every time. You ignore me on Email. Now you ignore me on reddit. Oh and I'm still waiting on that court letter. You LIAR.
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:36:57
Well fuck that in my case. Level 2 verified. Blah blah blah. Stolen card my ass. They still high risked me. So screw them. See them in court if they don't get this shit right asap.
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:55:26
thanks for that link there bro! I've sent a message to him. I have hope that he'll respond, tho if he doesn't I wouldn't be surprised. He has already ignored 8 of my emails. lol
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:47:40
i sent them 8 emails. Bombarded them on twitter. Not a voice to be heard unfortunately.
So I was like, ok they busy right? So I made a fake email and sent them another email pretending to be someone else with an issue, they responded the very next day to that email. looooool
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:58:02
Maybe you're blind for not being able to locate the transaction section in the picture.
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:41:19
Downvoted. They still have to honor my 100 BTC deal. Until then, this downvote will stay.
