Exactly, bnb has surpassed its previous all time high by a healthy amount.

What services do they provide?

Not directly, but they are accepting btc through "Bakkt" as a middleman which is just what early adoption looks like. You can't expect big business to go balls deep all up front. They have to dip their toes in the water first.

Google "Localbitcoins". As far as buying without id that's as good as you'll get.

The real reason he's not getting traction is because the system is rigged in their favor. He says that the crypto unit they are deploying relys on the bitlicense existing. It's essentially a ploy to keep the wealth in their own pockets by trying to make it seem like people who already have mountains of money are the only ones responsible enough to own crypto. They realize how profitable cryptocurrency is and want to make sure dirty poor people can't get their hands on it.

Very good question. 
Deflation is only a major problem for fiat currency. This is due to the fact that if you have a currency that you can print more of and its deflationary then it's because people don't have a use for it + the taxation hell the government would be in due to deflation.
This is also why bitcoin is called "digital gold". Even though we don't use gold as a payment vehicle in day to day life doesn't mean it has less value. Deflation on a scarce asset is a fantastic thing for price. People will more than likely hoard bitcoin and use another crypto for payment settling (xrp, Ada, ect...)

That's rough, bud. Brush up on some other scams while you're at it. Phishing sites can be another expensive lesson. Along with a compromised cpu replacing the wallet address you want to send money to with their own address. Wild west out there.

Dollar cost averaging is fantastic. I've been doing it since January of this year and I highly recommend it. Keeps me from fomoing into the market.

Might want to check the date on that article, bud.

Yeah, idk if you know what you're talking about OP. What period moving averages are you using?

Start a crypto club at your school. Pose it as an educational club only. Don't try and sell it as a get rich quick blah blah blah.

If he's a perfect lawyer you should be okay. Good luck in court!
