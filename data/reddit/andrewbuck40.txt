This is because it costs the same either way.  There is no advantage in sending TO a segwit address, only when you send FROM it in the future.  So you are saving yourself money by using segwit, but only once your coins are at the new address.  As others in the thread stated your only options are pay the crazy high fee now or wait.  I would recommend waiting if you can, but if it is urgent then you are kind of stuck.

The network is really backlogged right now.  It sounds like what you did is correct and your btc will arrive in your wallet eventually, but it might take a while because of the backlog.  If the transfer doesn't end up going through, it will stay with coinbase and eventually they will credit it back to your account.
So either way you should get your btc, they are just in limbo until the backlog clears.

Actually, you don't even really need hubs, since the payment can be routed across an arbitrary number of hops to get to the destination.  The autopilot settings for channel creation actually even try to route around hubs by making direct connections to far away points in the network, adding to the connectivity of the routing graph.

It depends on the wallet you are using, and how it constructs the transactions.  Most wallets though will add the fee as an amount on top of what you specify to send, so the reciever will get exactly the amount you intended but you will have a bit more deducted from your balance to cover the fee.
Also, keep in mind that the network is crazy backlogged at the moment so the fees are ridiculously high.  It is not advisable to transfer them right now unless you really need to and are willing to pay a pretty high fee.

Occasionally two different miners find a block very quickly one right after the other, before they have a chance to exchange the blocks.  This leads to a fork in the chain and one fork will die out a block or two later when the rest of the network continues building the chain on the other block.  The transactions in the orphaned block get put back into the mempool and then try to get into future blocks.  However some of the transactions may no longer be valid because they might be spending UTXOs that were spent on the other side of the fork (a double spend).  The farther down the chain a block is, the less likely this is to happen.
@_date: 2017-02-07 00:16:02
There is no way of guaranteeing you mine the next block, however you don't have to...
If you make transactions like this with large fees you could keep them in your own memory pool and not broadcast them to any other nodes or miners.  You do, however, include them in the block you are mining yourself so when you do eventually mine a block those transactions are in it and you claim the fee.  Since you are paying the fee to yourself it costs you almost nothing (see below).
We really need to start watching for this occurring.  Not saying this is what happened here, but if this kind of thing keeps happening and the same pool is always mining those very high fee blocks then they are doing what I have described above.
As to why you would do this... As a miner the only "cost" of doing this would be the fees on transactions that you didn't include in your block so that you had room for your "fake" high fee transactions.  The benefit is that it drives up the average fee on the network and since some wallets set their fee based on the average of the last N blocks, by artificially inflating the average you can dupe those wallets into paying higher fees than they otherwise would.

Yes, I am aware of this.  The US is definitely not a leader in internet access, but it is not some backwater either.  Furthermore, if the bandwidth requirements are too high for a typical US connection then they are too high for a typical US connection; i.e. something like 25 to 50 percent of the bitcoin userbase.

It is showing as a double spend as he tried to send the same ones twice.  This is no problem though as only one of the transactions will actually make it into a block.
They are unconfirmed because there is a huge backlog of transactions now.  If you resend them with a high enough fee you will beat the backlog and the transaction will confirm.  See [here]( for info on fees.

There were several chinese exchanges allowing zero fee trading and so much of the volume was simply bots trading with themselves to boost their own trading volume.  Once the exchanges introduced fees to trade a huge percentage of the volume disappeared overnight (as was expected) so people call it fake volume.

I am not an expert on it but my understanding is that a prospectus is anything you are giving to potential investors that contains information about the stock or fund.  Since you are giving it to investors to encourage them to buy, you need to file a copy with the SEC so they know what you are saying about the fund and when.  So, for example, if you put something misleading in the prospectus a later lawsuit can reference the filed documents to show that you were in fact advertising it in that way.

This is exactly the issue.  Although I have a fast internet connection, it is capped at 300gb per month total (tx + rx).  As such I already have to leave bitcoin shut down most of the time.  I start it up once a week or so to keep up with the chain and leave it run for a few hours after that to try to get to about 1 to 1 on the bandwidth ratio but then have to shut it down again.
I would like to keep it running all the time, but already it eats too much bandwidth to make this possible.  Blocks getting a bit bigger would not affect it hugely but something like 8 mb is totally insane.
P.S. I live in the US, so it is not like I am in someplace with limited internet connectivity.  If this is a problem for me then it is already an issue for a substantial number of people.

Replying to myself just to add that the poster's account is 7 days old and the only activity it has is posting this same thread 3 times in the last hour.

Although the post does raise some accurate points about LN the tone of it is pretty over the top.  LN is not convenient for every class of transaction or every user: that is what its detractors correctly point out, however the point they miss is that it doesn't have to be.
For every user who chooses to use the lightning network a huge amount of load is taken off the "regular" blockchain leaving more room for "regular" transactions.  The people who choose to use LN will be the ones for who LN makes economic sense, i.e. people sending lots of small amounts back and forth between a relatively small group of people.
A simple and obvious example is something like the famous Satoshi Dice website (which I don't think exists anymore but something like it probably does), where every single bet is 2 separate transactions, with the overall monetary flow roughly balanced in the two directions.  A more middle ground example is something like Bitquest, which is a minecraft server which uses bitcoin as its in-game currency.  Lastly you have things like exchanges which could use it to serve arbitrage customers moving BTC from one exchange to another.
The satoshi dice example removes a lot of simple transactions from the blockchain, the exchanges example removes a lot of complex multisig transactions from the blockchain, and the bitquest example removes some transactions but also serves its customer base more effectively by offering instant settlement.
So in short, the original poster can stick his fingers in his ears and pretend that LN is useless, but ironically he is hurting himself because even if he doesn't use it the fact that others who have a demonstrated usecase for it will.  And the offloading of those uses from the main chain to LN will leave more room for the "real" bitcoin transactions the poster cares about.
tldr; OP is a dumbass who can't see past their immediate use and thinks everyone has to be like them.

This would be an interesting way to benefit core mining pools.  Basically a way to pay extra for transactions where the fee can only be paid to a mining pool not running BU.
Furthermore, the BU dev team is so incompetent they would have a difficult time implementing this and they likely can't just do a simple pull request from the core branch since their branch has changed so much due to them renaming a bunch of variables and other such sillyness.
Interesting thought.
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:43:09
The flaw would be fixed by the large team of dedicated developers that core has; something BU does not have.
There have been bugs in the core code before that caused varying levels of problems for transactions and the network.  In every case they have been fixed quickly and with a level of professionalism.  This is why people support what the core devs are saying; because they have a demonstrated track record of being able to manage a complex system like bitcoin.

You are missing the whole point of the email though.  The point is that since it is a soft fork it doesn't matter if you "support" it or not, as long as it doesn't actively break your system then you have no reason to be against it.
Miners are not being asked to "vote", they are asked to signal readiness, nothing more nothing less.  The fact you are using terms like support means you don't even understand the argument made in the email.
@_date: 2017-02-26 14:59:14
The answer is they really don't.  However for most of them as long as _someone_ pays the desired amount for the product or service then do they really care?
They can help be a bit more sure by generating a unique payment address for each transaction and taking precautions to only show it to once customer and no one else.  Since it is a new address never used on the network and they only showed it to one person, then if it gets payment sent to it they can be fairly certain of who it was that paid it.

No, the ETF is a way for people with funds on a traditional stock exchange to buy shares in the ETF.  What do shares get you, in the case of this ETF each share gets you the "rights" to 0.01 bitcoin which is bought and held by the ETF on your behalf.  So it will likely increase buying pressure by making it easy for people to buy BTC in a way they are used to normally doing, like buying shares of stock.

Yes, I am aware of this which is why I said it costs them almost nothing rather than nothing at all.  I have made more detailed posts in the past where I described exactly what you just did.  I was just lazy this time and shortened it.  Thank you for clearing it up though, I probably should have just typed it out the first time.  I left it out for clarity in the main argument, but it probably is a nuance that is important.
The more relevent issue at hand is... is anyone watching for this sort of attack?  Are we cataloguing spam transactions, which pools are mining them, where they are relayed from, etc?  We both agree on the theoretical nature of this kind of attack and that the pools _could_ carry it out, but now the question is _are_ they?
@_date: 2017-02-27 22:35:40
It is hard to say.  Although I agree it could be a spammer, the other thing to consider is that most transactions sent by "real users" look pretty much like this: a single or at most a couple inputs and 2 outputs.
I agree we can't have all mining pools doing this all the time, but I think having one pool that specialises in these kinds of transactions is an interesting approach.

What is kind of funny is that I have thought about doing this in the past.  I decided I won't (at least for the time being anyway) due to the risk of a network split and the problems that would cause.
However the point seems somewhat moot anyway.  My node has been running steady for close to a month now with between 80 and 100 connections at most times and I rarely see even a single BU node connected to it.  They make up something like 5% of the network, so why do I never see them connecting to me?  The most I think I have ever seen at 1 time is 1, don't think I have ever seen 2 connected and I check it several times a day.
My guess is that most are simply fake nodes that don't do anything other than connect to the nodes like 21.co that keep statistics.
@_date: 2017-02-28 01:19:37
That is exactly the point you are missing though, it doesn't have to lead for cheap instantaneous transactions for everyone.  It only has to offload a few of the heaviest users and since they are the heaviest users this will free up a lot of space on the blockchain for everyone else.  Even taking 100 transactions per block off the blockchain makes a huge difference to the network since backlogs will form more slowly and clear more quickly.
EDIT TO ADD:  LN isn't meant to be used by the "average" user.  It is meant to be used by people who want to make tens or hundreds of transactions per day.  These people do exist and are currently completely unserved by bitcoin, and will continue to be unserved no matter how big we make the blocks on the blockchain.

It should do fine once it is caught up but that will take a long time.  If you are 1 year behind I would expect it to take multiple days to a week more to complete.  As stated above, the CPU is your bottleneck due to verifying transactions.  There are probably as many transactions in the last year as there were in all the previous years combined, so you are probably about half way there.
Just let it keep grinding away and expect it done some time next week.  Once you are caught up you can always spin up a node on a new computer by copying over the bitcoin directory with the blockchain info in it, so this is a process you will only have to do once, even if you decide to get a new computer.
@_date: 2017-02-21 23:47:17
What is even more interesting is the fees that they are putting on the transactions.  There are a bunch at around 11 sat/byte and a bunch at 20 sat/byte.  The 20 sat/byte ones made it into [this block]( and you can see that they actually made up a significant portion of the block.
This particular block was relayed by BTCC.  This in and of itself does not incriminate them but we as a community really need be keeping track of these kinds of transactions and whose blocks they are ending up in.  If a significant number of these keep being mined by the same pools then that is a strong indication that the pools are the ones doing this (since it costs them very little if they mine the blocks with the spam transactions themselves).
@_date: 2017-02-07 00:23:11
Not quite, it actually helps everyone even if they themselves are not using segwit.  This is because the people who do use segwit will produce transactions that take up less available space (segwit calls it weight) in a given block.  Since those people are using less space it leaves more space for other people even if they themselves don't use segwit.
The same is true of lightning.  Every person who chooses to send a lightning transaction frees up a little bit of space for people who are just doing regular on-chain transactions.  So segwit and lightning will lead to lower fees for you, even if you don't use either of them yourself.
@_date: 2017-02-26 13:58:24
Yeah, that is what I was wondering.  The only thing I could see that you could do at all was to keep a small list of really tiny transactions in reserve by not putting them in the first available block and then use them as a bit of "padding" to fill in the last few bytes of a block that you can't fit a jumbo transaction into.  Basically you are trying to solve something similar to the [knapsack problem]( so if you keep a few tx's in reserve for situations where you have a bit of extra space, or are not sure which tx's you can safely put into a new block then you could eek out a small gain in oveall numbers but it would be pretty minimal.

Hard to really say.  I think they have to register any prospectuses they give out so if they are posting stuff on their site or printing out mailers or whatever they have to register them.  So in this sense it is neither bullish or bearish.

The issue is that you are not paying for the amount of money you are transferring but rather you are paying for the storage space in the block chain that recording your transaction requires.
A small amount of money being moved from many addresses to a single output address takes a lot more space in the blockchain than a large amount of money from a single address to another single address.
So the small transfer might seem expensive on a percentage basis, but it is charged the same on a per byte of storage space basis.
Remember, you are not paying to send money, you are paying to record information forever in an unchangeable ledger that is backed up on thousands of computers all over the world.
@_date: 2017-02-21 23:52:10
I also did a bit of looking at the individual transactions.  All of the have a "relayed by ip address" of "blockchain.info".  Again not damning in and of itself but something that should be noted in cataloguing these kinds of spam attacks.
I am no expert, but my guess is that these were submitted directly to blockchain.info who then relayed them to the rest of the network as a way to hide the spammer's ip address, or the address of the node they relayed it to if they are not running their own node.

It's not about mining low fee transactions, but rather about spamming the network to fill up the mempool and drive up transaction fees across the board (since many wallets base their fee on the observed fees seen making it into transactions).  This would cost the spammer a lot of money to do, but they can recoup a lot of the cost if they are a mining pool that mines the specific blocks their spam transactions get placed into.
It would still cost them some amount to do this because as you pointed out they miss out on the transactions they would otherwise have included into the block, however if they can drive the average fee up enough with the spam they can more than make up for this loss and come out ahead.
Because of this we need to be tracking the following:
* What spam transactions are being created
* Where are they being relayed to the network from and also watching specifically for ones that are not relayed at all so the miner is guaranteed to be the one who includes them in a mined block
* What are the fees paid by the spam blocks and how do they compare to other transactions on the network
* And finally which mining pools are including spam transactions in their mined blocks.  If we see one (or a few) mining pools mining way more of these transactions than luck would suggest then we know something is up
Really I would like to know if anyone has done a formal analysis or whitepaper on this kind of attack as I think it is very relevant to the current network.  Not necessarily that it is being done now, but with the congestion we have it could be very effective if someone did want to carry it out.

I don't know about this specific idea for a proof of work but I think we should definitely be looking for alternative systems.  The original design for bitcoin was that the users and the miners were the same people (or at least largely overlapping).  However now the miners are almost completely separate from the users and they are starting to think that they are the important ones, not the users.
We either need to rein them in, or switch to some new mining proof of work that allows a much broader segment of society to mine again.  They work for us, and they would do well not to forget that.
@_date: 2017-02-06 02:37:05
This is the whole problem with larger blocks though, the whole point of bitcoin was that you didn't need to run it in a datacenter.  It is supposed to be peer to peer software running on the machines the actual users of the system have around them.
I am not saying the blocks can't ever get bigger or even that something like 2 or 3 mb is out of practicality now, but we need to keep in mind the issues of storage space and how that affects the people who are actually making the network useable, i.e. the users.

What you are talking about is called margin trading.  Some exchanges offer it, you can do it but it is very risky.  Learn lots about it before you try it, or better yet just don't.  If you are asking the kind of question you are asking then you don't know enough to do it safely.  Specifically, look up "margin calls" for how you can get really screwed if you make a bad trade.
I have been trading for a long time and I wouldn't touch a margin account with a ten foot pole.

There was quite a dip down from accumulated orders that all filled at once.  Total volume for that 5 minute span was only ~8 btc so not a huge loss of money but still something since the price dropped to around $1040.  Although they aren't really obligated to do it it would probably be worth it for coinbase to reimburse people for the amount they lost due to the slippage.  Probably a few thousand dollars or so, but if I were them I would consider it money well spent for PR.  Fortunately I didn't lose anything in the dip, but if I had I would be pretty pissed.

Although I agree with you in principle that outlawing cash as was done is probably bad for the poor your reasoning does not hold.  Simply because this specific action was bad for the poor does not mean a cashless society implemented by other means would also be bad for them.

I haven't looked definitively but is seems like coinbase (or rather gdax) has more volume as well and also some more depth on both the buy and sell sides.
I guess if you are in the US then it might have made sense to do some trading on the zero fee exchanges, but when the fees are the same or similar, then why not switch back to the local exchange so there are probably at least a few people who switched when the fees came up.

That is basically exactly what a lightning payment channel does.  Only it also goes one step further and allows you to pay people you don't have a direct channel with by routing the payment through a chain of people between you and the end recipient.  Also, it is trustless.  Very cool technology.

Child pays for parent is just where he send the unconfirmed transaction to a new address and pays a high enough fee to get immediate service for both transactions.

Do the ruby, etc, centerpieces actually do anything for the storage mechanism, or are they merely decoration?
Also, if the laser etched key is encrypted then presumably the user must store the key to decrypt it themselves.

I did a test to send a couple bucks to a segwit address and it went through last night.  I don't know if the linked site counts this or only spends from a segwit address, but people like me consolidating coins to segwit addresses to take advantage of cheaper sends in the future will be some of it.
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:48:52
Yes.  Also a communal benefit is that if you send from a segwit address the transaction leaves more room in the blocks for other transactions.  So the more people use segwit, the more room there is for everyone (segwit or not).

Yes, this is the whole reason bitcoin was created in the first place; to allow people to transfer money quickly and easily to people they wanted to buy things from.  By purchasing from merchants you are showing that there are customers who would prefer to pay in bitcoin given the option.  This is good for both the buyer (more secure) and the merchant (lower fees, etc).  If they start taking bitcoin and no one uses it, then they stop accepting it and everybody loses.
If they get enough business in BTC they may eventually decide to stop selling it right away all the time to avoid the extra fees.  This has a much more positive effect on the price then just HODL'ing.
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:56:01
Then what is the cost per transaction on the BCH network if you include new coins in the cost?  Although in some sense it is reasonable to include that cost in the per transaction fee, it needs to be put in context.
Since most of the newly mined coins are being bought up by the growing userbase, including them in the per transaction cost is highly misleading, without understanding the dynamics of what that number actually means.
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:50:17
But will anyone be able to find it?
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:50:44
That is either your change coming back to you on a new address, or a fee paid to the miners.  Some bitcoin wallets will automatically deduct the miner fee from the amount sent if you did not specify a fee to be included.  The miner fee is needed to incentivise the miners to actually include your transaction in a block, otherwise it never gets processed.
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:17:26
It will likely go through on the weekend when the transaction volume slows down a bit.  90 sat/byte is not crazy low so you don't have anything to worry about, it will go through, just slowly.  If the reciever wants it faster they can do a "Child pays for parent" transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:45:52
Ahh, then it is likely spam.  I wasn't saying that it wasn't spam, just that there are legit uses for transactions that look like this.  If they keep churning though then it is almost certainly spam.
I guess one other possibility is something like a coinjoin transaction.  Not sure if these get churned multiple times, but that could happen as well.
Keep in mind, I am not saying you are wrong.  I just don't want to fall into the trap that r/btc falls into where everything bad is an attack done by some shadowy group.  We really do need to watch for attacks, and I am glad you are doing so.  But doing so properly means taking a careful, measured approach and being cognizant of the kinds of things which look like spam, but aren't.
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:15:24
That's fine.  They will be doing so soonish I expect.  Keep in mind though, once your coins are at a segwit address, the next time you spend them not only do you get a slightly cheaper transaction fee, but you free up some space in the block for other users as well.  So it is worth making the switch early, but if you don't feel comfortable with it yet, there is nothing wrong with the old system.
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:28:34
Although these are very big transactions they might actually be legit.  Looking at the amounts sent it looks like they could be payouts from a mining pool to individual miners or something along those lines.  They picked a really bad time to do it, but that looks like it is what it could be.

You would need to run these 2 commands each time you want a new segwit address.  You can reuse the same address to send to multiple times, but this is not recommended for privacy reasons.  If each payment sent to you is to a new address it is harder to link together transactions and tie them back to you.
Later versions will very likely make new addresses be segwit ones by default but this will take some time.
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:14:33
Yeah, exactly.  It is 1 transaction to open the channel and another to close it with the final balance distributed to the relevant parties.  The open and close transactions are bigger than a normal transaction because they use multiple signatures, but after that it doesn't matter how many "lightning transfers" there are through that channel, the blockchain only sees the open and close.
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:46:57
Although it has been tested pretty thoroughly there is still the very small possibility of some kind of bug that a really paranoid user might want to wait before switching.  Also, if you have some custom software running somewhere that doesn't yet support segwit you may need old addresses.
I don't think either of these is terribly likely, but these are two possible reasons.  As you suggest, the overwhelming majority will want to use segwit, but the choice is important.  Segwit was made backwards compatible for a reason.

Also, even if your transaction never goes through, then you still have your coins.  They aren't lost, they are just waiting for the transaction to be finalized.  If it doesn't finalize then you never sent them and they are yours again.  This is why gdax won't credit you for the deposit until they are in a block, because they haven't actually changed hands yet.

Discussion of alternate clients was always allowed as long as those clients followed established protocols/consensus on the network.
If you want to change the network protocol the proper way to do it is to write a BIP, or submit to the dev mailing list, or even just discuss it on a forum like this one.  The wrong way is to code it up in a half-assed manner and tell everyone to start running it on the live network.  That is what gets you moderated here; not discussing changes, but encouraging irresponsible and dangerous behaviour.

Replying to myself to add...
Also this shows the stupidity of looking at marketcap as any kind of indicator of the value of an altcoin.  Simply premine 1 million coins, then sell 1 coin to your friend for 5 dollars and boom, 5 million dollar marketcap.
Just because you have a market cap of X, doesn't mean there are X dollars of actual value represented by the coin.
@_date: 2017-04-29 13:15:31
I didn't see it in the mempool of my node either, although I am not an expert with the command terminal in the client so it is possible I just made a mistake on which command to use.
I would suggest trying to re-broadcast the transaction if you can.  Not sure why it isn't showing on blockchain.info, but it seems like it didn't propagate through the network well, so the miners may not even have seen it.
@_date: 2017-04-29 00:07:31
Looking at market cap and volume is certainly better than market cap alone, however even volume does not help out a whole lot.  For the sake of argument lets forget about "fake" volume (where you buy and sell from yourself) and assume that a scammer is not doing that.
Instead, look at the fact that all these alt coins, and especially the scammy ones, start out at basically zero value.  All it takes is a few people to buy, say 100 dollars worth, and you have many thousands if not millions of coins of volume back and forth.  Now, the volume times price is still really small since the price is so low, but all this activity gets a few new people interested in the coin and the price starts to go up a bit.  The volume tapers off some since the price is higher, but when you get a rapid run up in price as is common, you can easily have lots of volume as the price starts to appreciate.
This is the problem with sites like coinmarketcap and their endless charts of hundreds of altcoins.  People think because there is some chart on a site somewhere and a few people buying and selling amongst themselves that there is a market there.  They see 10,000 coins sold for 10 cents a piece and think that real money is changing hands, and that there is really 1,000 dollars of real value there, when in reality there is 0 dollars of value; *because no one actually takes that shitcoin as payment anywhere.*
This is what actually matters: not the market cap, not the volume, not the depth of outstanding buy orders (better than the other two but can be cancelled in a heartbeat).  No, what really matters is whether you can actually buy a loaf of bread with the coin, and for 99.9% of  cryptocurrencies you can't buy anything, anywhere.
**This is what sets bitcoin apart from these coins, not its market cap; but the fact you can actually use it to buy real goods and services.**  People who freak out when bitcoin goes from 70% of the crypto marketshare to 65% would do well to remember this.

It is not a complete solution to the blocksize issue, but it lays the groundowrk for future work that helps signifigantly.  The most direct benefit is offloading microtransactions onto the lightning network.  It also fixes quadratic scaling of signature verification which allows block size to be increased safely (doing it without the quadratic fix makes the network easy to DDOS).  Lastly, it lays the groundwork to allow schnorr signatures, which make transactions smaller (especially mutisig transactions which are becoming more common).
Also, because of how the block weight is calculated it encourages people to sweep up their dust transactions into single addresses which reduces the UTXO set size.  Although this doesn't directly help the block size issue, it makes the network scale better by lowering the memory requirements to run a node since the entire UTXO set must be kept in memory for fast lookups.
@_date: 2017-04-29 15:33:41
The name segwit is short for "segregated witness".  The basic idea is that since the blocks are limited to 1mb we can work around that by only putting the actual source, destination, and amounts transferred portion of the transaction in the 1mb limited portion of the block.  The rest of the transaction is the "witness data" which are the signatures needed to prove that the transaction was created by the authorized holder of those coins and not someone else.  This witness data is put in a different part of the block which does not count against the 1mb limit.  This extra witness data portion of the block is allowed to be 3 mb.  So you get a maximum of 1mb of source/destination data and 3 mb of signature data.
So the 1mb limit is still in place, but only a portion of the transaction counts toward that limit.  If you look at the trransactions on the network today roughly half of the space they take is the signatures.  So that is where the 1.7mb block size number people talk about comes from.  And yes, as you asked as your last point, this assumes some portion of the traffic is segwit type transactions.  However once segwit is enabled people will likely switch to using it quickly since those transactions will be cheaper to send.
So long story short, yes the 1mb limit stays exactly as it is, but we will basically be able to process 1.7 times more transactions in each block once segwit is activated and in common use.
A side benefit of segwit is that it also fixes transaction malleability, which makes the lightning network and other smart contracts work much more cleanly and securely.  The lightning network is already in use on the testnet (which has segwit enabled), and also on some altcoins which also recently activated segwit.
It also fixes a quadratic scaling issue in the time needed to verify blocks which means if we decide to increase the 1mb limit in the future the network will be less able to be DDOSed by an attacker.  Increasing beyond 1mb today without fixing the quadratic scaling first would open us up to DDOS attacks.
@_date: 2017-04-29 16:28:28
Upgraded nodes that understand segwit will download both the regular block and the witness portion of the block.  Old un-upgraded nodes will only download the regular block portion.  From their perspective the transactions will look like "anyone can spend" transactions, although if they try to actually spend them the network will reject those attempts.
So bandwidth requirements will increase to accommodate the extra transactions, but storage requirements will not go up by the same amount.  This is because once the transactions have been properly verified, you can choose to throw away the witness data and still have a verifiable transaction history that you validate yourself.
EDIT.  P.S.  I am not an expert on the intricacies of segwit, so what  I am explaining here is going to be mostly correct but I may have got some minor details wrong.  I want to give a basic overview of the system to help people understand it, but this is not meant to be a perfectly accurate account of every last detail.

I recommend using this to estimate your fees.

No lambo.  I sold them when they were a few dollars each and was (and still am in a way) quite proud of my return on investment.  Of course in hindsight if I had kept them I could have sold them for way more, but the way I look at it is that if everyone just help their coins forever then they would be worthless since they are meant to be a currency, not something you hoard.
I have been buying, selling, and using bitcoins since 2010.  Not continously, and I certainly don't spend them very often because it is still hard to find places to use them for the things I buy, but I think the technology is sound, and the coins will only be useful if people actually _use_them, rather than just hoarding.
There is nothing wrong with HODLing but when you won't sell them under any circumstances then you are not a HODL'r you are a hoarder.

I wouldn't call it a prediction, more just speculation based on if the trendline continues upwards and picks up speed a bit from where it is now.  The point was not that we will hit some specific number 2 weeks from now, but rather that as more people use segwit that means more utxo's sitting at segwit addresses, which means more segwit spends.  So the point was just to illustrate the general principle.
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:32:10
To clarify for others, what Pink_pez was saying was that there have been blocks with higher percentage of segwit transactions in the past, but bitking74 is pointing out that these blocks are anomalous as they only had a few transactions in them total.  They had a high percentage of segwit transactions, but it was really only a few transactions.

I was just assuming that they will force EDA retargets to get the profitability to parity with BTC.  Since BCH is about 0.1 BTC right now, that means parity is when the BCH difficulty is 0.1 of BTC.  2 or 3 EDA retargets would get them right in this range and it looks like if they get one at all they will get at least 2.
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:42:04
It's more than a couple percent, but you are right that it is not beyond the realm of possibility.  The difficulty is at 15% right now and will drop to around 10% after the EDA, so antpool alone has twice the hashing power of the rest of the bch miners.  (actually more since they themselves are one of the major minors and if they became malicious they would massively outhash the remainng honest pools).

Just because you are willing to pay, does not make it not spam.  It just means you are willing to pay to send the spam.

We won't see blocks consistently greater than 1mb until a lot more segwit transactions are happening.  Right now with 1.2 percent of transactions the witness data is only 0.4 percent of the block, so the max blocksize is something like 1004 kb.  So you need to get to 5 or 10 percent segwit transactions before you are consistently seeing larger blocks.
We will get there though.  Keep in mind that the effect is cumulative.  Each time someone sends to a segwit address, that is one more user who upgraded, and will likely send more transactions on segwit in the future.  So the growth will pick up fast once it gets going.
Also, right now the main reason blocks are below 1mb is because it is the weekend and there just aren't enough transactions to fill the blocks.  That is why I recommend people sweep up their dust utxo's and (preferably) push them to a segwit address with a 5 or 10 sat/byte fee.

Depending on the amounts he is buying they might actually be required to ask.  Let me be clear, I am not necessarily defending this, just giving one possible explanation:
Banks are required by law to keep records of large transactions to and from accounts on behalf of their customers.  If you are transferring more than a certain amount per month, you have to provide documentation to the bank as to what the transfers are for so that they are in compliance with anti money laundering laws.  If you are unable to provide such documentation they are required to report it and/or to close your account.

And the extra chain bloat happens on the 1mb fork with no extra transactions on the 2mb side, which they can then spin to say how much the 1mb fork is overloaded, the fees are too high, etc.
It really is a brilliant setup.  I am starting to think we may have got it wrong when we said their developers aren't that skilled.  :)

You are probably right that lost coins won't become a big problem.  If they do become a problem a solution like the one I outlined could be implemented.
It also has the additional advantage of helping the market understand how many coins there actually are in circulation.  For example, satoshi had something like a million coins, which is a non-trivial amount.  No one really knows if he is just sitting on them, or if the private key is lost or forgotten.  If the 20 year rule was implemented then the market would know for sure (after 20 years anyway), when the coins are either moved to keep them fresh, or recycled.
So there are advantages for transparency, even if future losses of coins are smaller.  Ultimately I think with a long timeout like 20 years, it is an acceptable tradeoff.  Even in cold storage, doing a transfer once every 20 years is a pretty minimal burden.  3 or 4 transfers over the course of a life is not too much to ask.
@_date: 2017-09-04 00:32:42
There are two schools of thought on lost bitcoins.  The first is that it doesn't matter, because they are subdivisible down to as many decimal places as we want (software currently only goes to 8 decimal places but this could be changed).  Since they are subdividable, losing a bunch just means the rest are worth more and we use smaller and smaller units as time goes on.
The second school of thought (and my preferred method) is to simply reissue lost coins over time.  So you implement a consensus rule something like "if a coin has not been moved in 20 years, it gets destroyed and then re-issued as a mining reward in the future".  Then all people have to do is transfer the coins to themselves every 10 to 15 years if they really are holding them for a long time, but if keys get lost then the coins will just "time out" and re-enter circulation sometime in the future.
So there are never more than 21 million coins, but lost ones get recycled.  (if this rule was implemented).

This is probably the whole point of what they are trying to do.  By your bitcoin gold for pennies on the dollar in the hopes you screw up and send your real bitcoin as well.
Edit:  For clarity, this is a major scam.  Stay far away.
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:46:35
I don't know which wallets support creating a transaction that has this included, however Check Lock Time Verify and/or Check Sequence Verify are the opcodes you want to use.  As for how to create a transaction using that in a friendly way, I am not sure.  But at least you have somewhere to start looking now.

Mining pools need to update a config file in order to start producing blocks bigger than 1mb.  Some pools haven't for either ideological reasons or incompetence.
It is their loss though, as this just leaves those extra segwit transactions sitting in the mempool and the other mining pools will get the fees for them instead.  Eventually, when segwit is a signifigant portion of the network, this will become too big of a loss for them and they will update their configuration and start mining bigger blocks.

The rule would be phased in so that people know about it.  In order to keep your coins from being destroyed, all you have to do is transfer them to another address you own once every 20 years, or whatever the timeout period is.  It is not theft to recalim coins that really are lost.  And if you want to keep them for more than 20 years you just move them every so often.

I agree with you on the issues of privacy.  I am not saying there are not problems there, quite the contrary I think it is a big problem.  However, as cool as bitcoin is, it is really bad from a privacy perspective since every transaction is public forever.  Like I said, bitcoin is cool, and I like the idea, but don't think that just because the existing system is bad and bitcoin is different therefore bitcoin must be perfect.
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:16:44
It's not helping a lot, but it is a constant downward pressure on the growth of the mempool.  An extra few percent doesn't sound like a lot, but it is an extra few percent *every block*, which adds up over time.  It means the mempool fills more slowly (meaning it peaks at a lower value) and when it starts dropping it drops more quickly.  Since the peak was lower it goes from peak to empty more quickly.  This is why it is clearing regularly now, rather than just once every couple weeks.
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:02:19
You are kind of right.  Keep in mind that when you make a transaction you don't spend the coins at an *address* but at a *UTXO*.  You may have one address with several UTXOs, and each one needs replay protection to be safely spent.  This is why this method they propose is so dangerous.  You have to either consoldate everything to a single UTXO and replay protect that, or you have to individually protect every single UTXO individually and make sure you don't mess up any of them.
This is a really shitty way of implementing replay protection.  One could be forgiven for thinking they made it this bad intentionally.
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:11:37
Looks like that is exactly what happened.  The replay protection had a whole list of problems, but the bug seems to be what finally did it in.
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:21:23
There is nothing unsafe about it.  In fact it can be useful if you need to get it to its destination faster.  If you spend an unconfirmed output from the first transaction (you may need to manually tell your wallet to do this) and the second transaction has a large enough fee, the miner will be forced to put both transactions into a block in order to claim the large second fee.
The term for this is child pays for parent.  However, keep in mind that the backlog of transactions right now was from the bitcoin cash EDA fluctuation that just happened.  It is fairly likely all pending transactions will clear this weekend, so if that is fast enough for you I would just wait.  You can see the mempool here, look especially at the bottom graph and see where your transaction falls.
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:19:38
If you own BTC at the time of the fork you get BTC and BTC2X in equal amounts.  So you get coins on both chains.  A replay attack is where you spend your coins on one chain (and mean to keep your other ones) but someone replays your signed transaction onto the other chain and spends those coins, too.  So the risk is that you could lose coins you did not intend to spend on the other chain.
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:33:30

@_date: 2017-10-06 21:20:26
Exactly.  It will sort itself out, but for now it kind of brings into focus their lie about how much we needed bigger blocks right away.  Now that we have bigger blocks via segwit, some of the big block mining pools are still mining 1mb blocks because they can't be bothered to change a config setting.
@_date: 2017-10-07 00:16:58
It is bad if you want to keep coins on both sides of the fork.  If you think the 2x side is just going to die and become worthless then you don't need to do anything.  If you transact on the 1x side and the coins get replayed and you lose them, then you lose only the 2x ones, your 1x coins still go where they were supposed to.  The real danger is people trying to dump their 2x coins and accidentally losing their 1x coins in the process.

I watched about half of it a while back.  I think Andreas does an excellent job on the technical aspects, but I don't always agree with him philosophically.  I think bitcoin is very interesting technology, and have been involved in it since long enough to have personally interacted with Satoshi on the original forum, but I never really bought into the whole "end the fed" mentality that a lot of people here share.
I think people misunderstand what money is and how it functions in our society and they take this misunderstanding and build a belief system on top of it that does not hold water.  Bitcoin is cool, and will do a lot to help a lot of people, but it is not a magic bullet, and the existing monetary system is not the root of all evil.  People who think either of these two things are missing the broader picture.
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:10:58
Although you are right that 2% is 2% whether one block or many, what an analysis like that misses is that the mempool is not the transactions happening right now, but rather the sum total of all the transactions that have not cleared in the last few hundred or so blocks.  So the extra 2% has somewhat of a cumulative effect since the number of transactions entering the mempool ebbs and flows, but the extra 2% is always there.
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:17:51
It would consolodate your entire balance into a single UTXO (unspent transaction output).  Then when you make the second transaction this UTXO gets tapped as an input and since it is bigger than the 1 satoshi you send to the blacklist address the rest gets sent back as change.
It sounds to me like it would work, but I am not an expert on the intricacies of this.  Which is why I posted the informative response in the first place.
Basically, their method does work, but you need to be very careful about how you do it, based on what wallet you are using and how your current coins are distributed.

Yes.  My point was that the address is an old style address, not a segwit one.  I would prefer to donate to a segwit supporting address to increase the number of transactions using the new format.  Normally, it wouldn't make any difference, but on a site specifically about segwit adoption, it seems wrong to have a donation address that is not using segwit.
I will probably end up donating a few bucks either way, but would prefer to do it via segwit.  Will wait a couple days to see if the site gets updated first though.

As of right now all the software has a hard coded limit.  You could re-compile it and change it, but there is no setting to change it right now.  This is done to protect users from putting large amounts of money into the system since it is still early in its development.

He is referring to bitcoin cash.  Since the difficulty is so low a malicious mining pool could rewrite several blocks in a row on that blockchain, allowing them to reverse transactions that already had some confirmations.
So an attacker could send bitcoin cash to an exchange, sell the tokens once they deposit, and then rewrite the blockchain so those transactions never took place, leaving the exchange with nothing.
@_date: 2018-07-21 12:39:26
The hashing is only part of it.  It uses ECDSA signatures to sign transactions, merkle trees with SHA256 for validating blocks and repeated SHA256 with a difference nonce each time for mining.
And SHA256 is cryptographically secure because of the guarantees it makes about its operation.  There is much more to cryptography than "keeping things secret".  Making sure data is valid and has not been changed is an important part as well.
@_date: 2018-07-10 04:27:28
No, the hard coded limit is client side, and it is not enforced elsewhere on the network, so changing it is not the issue like it was with the blocksize.  It's only a temporary protection against users who don't know enough about the system to understand the risks at this point.  If you know enough to recompile the software and remove the limit, you should know the risks.

Reusing addresses is not unsafe, it is just sub optimal from a privacy perspective.  By receiving multiple payments to the same address you make it easier for people looking at the blockchain to work out that all those transactions are for the same person.
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:22:00
The 6% is only the chance that it is not able to find a successul route since the payment is large (compared to the size of the open channels on the network).  This will go away over time, but for now, channels are mostly kept tiny since the software is new.
Not finding  successful route doesn't mean you lose money, just that you are unable to make that payment because it is too big for the network at this time.
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:39:22
By size they mean how many bytes was the actual transaction.  Your transaction gets stored in the blockchain forever and the size that needs to be stored is what you pay based on, not the amount transferred.
If you look up the address you sent it to on a site like blockchain.info it will show you the incoming transactions to that address.  Then you can click on the specific transaction id and see a bunch of info about it, like what size it is and what the fee density (measured in sat/byte was).  Typical fees right now are around 120-150 satoshis per byte of data to be stored.

If Jihan forks and BU is a technical mess, we can fix that.  If the UASF goes poorly and turns into a mess, we can fix that.  We have fixed bugs and unintended forks in the past and we almost certainly will do so again in the future.

I do look at the daily stats and I know about the variation luck can cause.  There was a major jump in total network hashrate (which is not just a bit of luck) and at the same time the BU signalling and the size of the BU pools all went way up.  More importantly, the pools traded places in the size rankings, which happens occasionally due to luck, but not major shift like we see now.  Compare the Size of the pools over the last week on the piechart on coindance and compare that to the pools over the last day (which is the same as it was yesterday).  Formerly small players are now in second and third place, and antpool is way bigger than it was.
This is more than just statistical variation.  This is a change in the underlying hash power.

@_date: 2017-05-10 15:56:22
Asking for a source for something like that is a red herring.  Of course there is not going to be a post somewhere we can point to where Jihan admits he controls them all, and what other direct proof that would satisfy your claim your request can there be.
The fact that they all added a massive amount of hashing power within a day of each other when all the other pools didn't seems to suggest at least some level of cooperation, if not outright collusion.  This coupled with the fact that we have seen them shift miners from one pool to the other, as well as their similar messaging all point to coordination.  There is no smoking gun, but there is a lot of circumstantial evidence that, taken as a whole, means they are much closer to eachother than a group of major competitors ought to be.
We were so worried about the possibility that BU would lead to mining centralisation that we failed to see the centralisation that was happening right in front of our eyes.
@_date: 2017-05-10 17:57:05
Segwit and 2mb at the same time is fine and although it is not my preferred solution I would be ok with that.  My point was simply that due to the quadratic scaling issue an increase *without* segwit is unsafe.  Doing them together is safe, but there will be no increase without segwit.  If you want to see an increase you have to accept segwit, or write code to fix quadratic scaling without it, before you can have the increase.

@_date: 2017-05-07 22:51:55
As far as I understand it, yes.  Sweeping and sending are the same thing, people just use sweeping when they talk about lots of very small inputs to the transaction.  It is just a terminology thing, nothing fundamentally different.  For estimating the transaction fee I recommend this site:
Start looking at it around wednesday or thursday and watch to see how it performs going into friday.  For cheapest service you want to be in the lowest colored band that it looks like it will dip down to over the weekend.
If you are only sending from a few imput addresses then you can just pay the standard fee, but if it is more than 10 or so the fees get really crazy unless you wait for the weekend and set it really low, like 20 or 30 sat/byte.
P.S. Pay more attention to the graph on the bottom, which shows by transaction size.  Some of the small value transactions are huge so the number of transactions might be low, but it will take many blocks to grind through them.
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:06:11

@_date: 2017-05-10 17:02:05
I agree with you in theory, but I think in this case it is not a big issue.  The BU chain would be considered invalid by the core nodes and miners so from our point of view it will just look like a bunch of miners dropped off the network.
The only reason they really even need 50% is to prevent us from overwriting their chain with reorgs but we don't plan to do that anyway, so why wait for more hash power.  Just do it already.
@_date: 2017-05-10 17:53:31
I could be wrong about this.. I had actually looked at the graph you posted showing the difficulty, but it looks like the jump in hashrate was about a week ago rather than just in the last few days.  Either way though I think my broader point still stands that the stalemate is ridiculous and if they are going to fork they should just do it, otherwise it is just a delay tactic.
@_date: 2017-05-10 17:33:30
Then they are forced to change their stance from passive aggression to active aggression.  Orphaning other miner's blocks will not end well for them.  It would piss off the community, it would piss off the other miners, and it would cost them money since if they try to orphan a block but do not succeed in finding a successor before the rest of the network does then they lose any hashing they contributed to looking for a competing block to orphan the segwit block.
All in all this is a costly and dangerous game for them to play, compared to the easy one they are playing now where they tweet something mean and we all shit ourselves out of fear of the almighty Jihan.  Time to pull back the curtain and show the world that the wizard of oz Jihan has no real power, and no real backing outside of his small group of cronies.

They should fork now because of the crisis, the mempool is full, core is corrupt, and blockstream and axa and patents starbucks and AHHHHHHHHH.  
They are the ones who say all this crap, they have stopped segwit while at the same time complaining about all the nonsense I mentioned.  They claim to care about the poor disenfranchised Africans who can't afford a 50 cent fee to transfer bitcoins.  So why aren't they doing anything about it when they could fork and be done with it.
They don't even really need 50%, they could have forked with less.  Once they fork they have 100% of the hashpower on the fork, no matter what percentage of the total is anyway, so why don't they do it.  The answer is because they don't want to, they like the system the way it is now with us eating out of their hand.
Well I am sick of it.  I am calling their bluff.

@_date: 2017-05-10 17:45:16
Currently bitcoin blocks are limited to 1mb each which limits the number of transactions per second the network can process and we have reached that limit.  This means you have to pay a higher fee to have your transaction processed or it will take a long time to go through (and it may never go through if the fee is way too low).
There are two main proposed solutions to this (and a few minor ones).  The main two are Segregated Witness (segwit) and Bitcoin Unlimited (BU).  You can read up on those to get a better understanding of what is going on.
Basically the majority of the community supports segwit, but Jihan Wu  and Roger Ver back bitcoin unlimited and have been threatening to fork the chain over it.  I think they are bluffing, and are just using BU as a delay tactic, so I wrote this post calling on them to either go ahead with the fork or stop blocking segwit.  Either way, just end the pointless stalemate.

@_date: 2017-05-10 17:48:06
I am fine with that, but segwit must be done first for safety reasons.  If we have larger blocks without segwit an attacker can form a specially crafted transaction, mine it in a block, and ddos the network.  This is a major threat, so a simple compromise of "just do both" doesn't really apply, you have to do segwit first, so if Jihan and Roger actually wanted larger blocks they would stop blocking segwit and activate it so that we can have a reasonable discussion about how to raise the blocksize.  Right now it just can't be done safely.

1 sat/byte is pretty low, and unlikely that you will clear at that price but 5-10 sat/byte transactions do make it through when the mempool empties out.  Keep an eye on this site, pay specific attention to the bottom graph since that shows by transaction size which is what really matters.

Why wait until 75 when 51% is all he needs.  Everyone knows he will never make 75% so saying they won't fork until they get there is saying they will never fork.  That is the point of my post; I don't think they intend to ever fork.  This isn't about implementing the solution they think is best because they don't plan to ever implement that solution.
They won't fork now, they won't fork ever.  They want to stall segwit because blocking it means higher mining fees now, allowing asicboost going forward, and crippling competition from the lightning network.
This is about control.  He has it, and he won't give it up.  Don't fall into his trap by thinking he actually wants to hardfork, because that is exactly where he wants you; waiting to see what he does, waiting forever because the current situation is one where he is the king.

No, breaking it into 6 pieces like that makes it more expensive since there are 6 outputs rather than 1.  Generally you want to keep the outputs as few as possible.  A typical transaction is however many inputs you need to "tap" to get enough to pay the recipient and then 1 output to them and 1 output back to yourself for any "change" if the inputs were a bit bigger than necessary.
Keep in mind that this transaction does not look like what you would do yourself.  This is bitstamp paying 11 or 12 people all at the same time, so the 15 dollar fee is really more like 1 dollar for each "person" paid in the transaction.  That is why the total fee was so high.

Sweeping is just a term for sending all the money at all the addresses in one wallet to somewhere else.  It is not a "special" transaction as far as the network and fees are concerned.  I would recommend waiting until the weekend to do it though if you are moving money from very many small transactions, this way you can pay a much lower fee for the transfer.  There was a ton of traffic all this week so the mempool did not clear out this weekend but there is a decent chance it will next weekend and you can do the transfer nearly free.
@_date: 2017-05-11 19:04:26
If you created 12 separate outputs, then to move the full amount again you need to tap all 12 of those as inputs, so the next transaction would be of a similar fee.  My assumption was that you were sending to a single address, which is not the case if you had 12 outputs.
Basically your fee is based on the size of the transaction only.  So if you keep doing complex ones like you did with many inputs and outputs then they will be expensive.  If you really want to know the details read up on how bitcoin transaction work on the bitcoin wiki.  If you are handling 10,000 dollars worth of bitcoins, you really will want to learn the details of the system.

Keep in mind that a softfork is safer to do with a flag day activation since it is backwards compatible, so you need a fairly long lead time on the flag day, but other than that this could work.
The thing is, until you write the code and have it assessed on its technical merits you are just speculating.  This is an open source project, which means code is king.  The people who wanted UASF weren't taken very seriously by anyone until they wrote code.  Then they got attacked by other core supporters because their code had crappy bugs in it.  After a few iterations now it is a pretty solid proposal.  They went through several revisions to the code, and two separate bips before the details were ironed out.
If you want segwit plus 2mb, then get coding and be prepared to fix any technical problems associated with it.

Hash rate isn't everything.  People focus too much on hash rate, orphaning blocks, longest chain, etc, and they ignore that in order for those blocks to actually matter *other* people have to accept them as valid.  You can mine all the blocks you want, but if no one else recognizes them then you are just wasting your time.
They could fork with 20% of the hashrate and be just fine, because the rest of the community would not attack their chain, they will just ignore it.  Just like they would ignore it if they had 90% of the hashrate.
Outside of the miners almost no one supports BU.  So they can mine and mine and mine and waste all the electricity they want, it doesn't matter.  Their blocks are worthless without anyone else who honors them, and they know no one will.  Hence me calling their position a bluff.

I don't fundamentally disagree with you, however I did note that I meant full size "in regards to other standard options like mintxfee".  Basically my point was simply that the graph should show the mempool size running with all the default options, except for the limit on max mempool size.
If there are low value transactions that will never confirm, then fine, they will show up on the bottom of the graph in the 0-5 sat/byte section.  Whether they will confirm or not is dependent on the other transactions in the pool, so showing them I think still makes sense.
EDIT:  Also, if they keep getting rebroadcasted then they are still "valid" transactions as per the criterion I outlined.  After 3 days with no rebroadcast, they will get dropped by the standard options, and therefore should be dropped from Johoe's graphs.
Also, thank you for the work you are doing coding for core, and for spending as much time as you do combatting trolls here on reddit.  I know it is often a thankless job, but I want to say thank you for what you are doing.
@_date: 2017-05-05 22:39:12
If your server is capable of it, it might be worth increasing the max mempool size on your node to something higher.  This way the full size of the mempool is recorded in your graph.  (Full size meaning full in regards to the other standard options like mintxfee and so forth).
P.S.  I love your site, I check it all the time to see how the mempool is doing and I have never been steered wrong by using it to estimate my fees manually.  Great work.
@_date: 2017-05-06 03:10:12
Yes, my comments were only in relation to Johoe's graph.  I feel there is a use in seeing the "full" mempool, even if that means seeing some transactions which will "never confirm".  Although these transactions don't matter in the sense of fee estimation, they are useful for understanding the broader dynamics of the overall system.  Things like spam attacks, and things like "dust sweeping" both will show up on such a graph, even if they won't make it into a block anytime in the near future.  It is important to be able to get a grasp of these things, even if they don't make it into the blockchain, if for no other reason than to better understand the "floor" of what gets confirmed and what doesn't.
I like the graphs you linked, and will have a better look at them.  I think the fee market is an important part of the bitcoin ecosystem and would like to see more work done on understanding its dynamics.  I have thought a bit about it, but it would be interesting to see more rigorous analyses of it carried out by experts.  Fee estimation is just one aspect of this market, others are things like what uses are people finding for transactions in different price ranges, what markets are being served, what markets are not, etc.

Keep in mind that if the network is under attack the last thing we need is a bunch of people trying to bootstrap nodes starting from block 1.  Even if you are going to run a pruning node I think you still have to download the entire blockchain first.
Therefore it is a good idea in my opinion to spin up a node now, let it get current, and then shut it down.  Fire it up once  a month or so to catch up, so that if we ever need you to help fight an attack you are not so far behind.
Anyway, just something to consider.
@_date: 2017-05-12 02:03:44
Really the free/low fee transaction thing was always a lie.  In the early days with 50 btc per block mined the transaction fee was just paid for with inflating the money supply.  Now we have less monetary inflation, but higher fees.
In other words the transaction fees are now being paid by people actually making transactions rather than by an inflationary tax on all bitcoins held (whether they are transferred or not).  This is why some see the fee market as an important component of the system.  We are subsidising the cost of transactions less and less, so now people actually have to decide whether a transaction is worthwhile or not before sending it.
For a group of people who think the market should do everything, it is ironic that so many object to the fee market doing exactly what it should do, discourage useless transactions.

Mined blocks are only valid if other nodes on the network can understand them and accept them as valid.  90% of miners could agree to remove the 21 million coin cap, but unless everyone else goes along with that they are mining invalid blocks and therefore they are worthless to everyone but them.  This is the balance of power that makes bitcoin work.  Miners can't change the rules without actual users deciding to agree to the new rules.
@_date: 2017-05-09 12:51:50
That's what I was wondering.  If a wallet is looking at the minimum fee to be included in a block then this would up the value, however I hope wallets are not so dumb as to do this simple of a calculation.

Depending on what you are trying you might want to look into the bitcoin testnet.  For trying out things that is exactly what it is for.  There are faucets that will send you like 20 testnet coins for free (they are worthless, but used for testing, hence the name).  They work exactly like normal bitcoins, just on their own blockchain and they have no monetary value.
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:27:36
Buy and sell orders completed on markets don't end up on the blockchain.  The blockchain is people transferring bitcoin from one person to the other.  All the activity on the markets is done in a private database run by the market, so they don't affect the blockchain at all until you transfer them off of the market.
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:42:26
By the way, your transaction fee was probably so high because there were a lot of inputs to that transaction.  A 1 input 2 output transaction now costs around 50 cents.  You probably had like 20 or more inputs all combined into 1 for that transaction, so if you send them again the next time the feee will be much more reasonable.  Basically think of it like getting a whole bunch of small bills (or pennies) as payment, the bank might charge a fee to deposit them since it is a pain in the ass to count them all.  But now you are holding 1 large bill which is much easier to work with.
@_date: 2017-05-11 19:42:49
Ahh, so you do have all your coins on a single address then, so yes, a new transfer would cost you like 50 cents.  It sounds like bitstamp process a bunch of withdrawals in a single transaction which is why 1 of the 12 outputs went to you.  If you look at the fees paid on the transaction you can see how much went to the miners, that will be the "fee" amount on blockchain.info.  You can show the amounts in either USD or BTC by clicking on one of the red or green buttons down below showing the amount of any particular transaction total.
You do have some control over the complexity.  Your wallet will try to make the transactions as small as possible generally, but sometimes you might want to build the transaction differently by choosing different inputs (for example to combine a bunch of small ones), or also to make multiple outputs (like bitstamp did in this case).  The system is really flexible, but a bit confusing at first.
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:20:13
I couldn't agree more.  I don't think it is the best way forward, but it is a way forward.  I don't think it will be catastrophic.  People keep saying it is a way to "fire" the core devs, but no one can fire them.  If they leave because of this it will be their choice and theirs alone.
I can't say I blame them, most are volunteers and they want to code what they want to code, but I think it is better to accept that 2x is basically guaranteed to happen at this point and the best path forward is to try to work with it and make it a successful transition, not to fight it and ultimately lose.
@_date: 2017-07-12 19:14:34
Bitstamp will have added some fee (paid by them presumably).  If you have the transaction id number you can search for it on a site like blockchain.info
Look at the fee/byte (in units of sat/byte) and see where you are in the bottom graph on the page I linked.  When the graph on the bottom gets "eaten away" down to the level where your transaction is at it will clear.  It might go early, as miners can put any transactions they like in a block and don't always pick highest first, but the majority of each block ends up being whatever is highest fee.
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:26:03
That is exactly what I am saying.  I think the 2x hardfork sucks, but I think it sucks a lot less than wondering if we will even be able to transact 2 weeks from now.
People talk a big game about the "security" of the bitcoin system, but part of security is keeping the system working as designed, not just stopping bad things from happening but making sure the things the system was designed to do keep happening.
All this talk of splitting off into something like 5 possible forks is basically a denial of service attack we are doing to ourselves.

If the fee is 0 it will likely never confirm.  As far as I know there is no way to "cancel" a transaction, but you could "double spend" the coins back to an address you control.  You will likely have to do a bit of messing around to do this, but google should be able to help you out.  I don't know how electrum works, only bitcoin core, so I can't help you with the details but it is possible.
If you double spend them and that transaction has a high enough fee to get confirmed, then your coins will be safe where you sent them in the second transaction (i.e. back to yourself).
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:44:56
No.  I am saying you need to be realistic about what options you have going forward.  Sticking to your principles by burning down the system you support is not really sticking to your principles.
At this point you don't get to choose between "2x" and "not 2x", your only choice is chain split or not.  And whether you like the 2x part or not (and I don't) the chain split will be far worse.  2x might cause problems years down the road, but we have time to address those problems.  A chain split means the end of bitcoin a week after it happens when everyone who has ever heard of bitcoin reads a story on the front page of every newspaper about the thousands of people who lost their bitcoins because "it broke".  The headlines will be wrong, and the stories will be wrong, but that doesn't mean it won't forever destroy the reputation of the currency, and it will very likely never be taken seriously again by the 99.999% of the population who doesn't read this forum.

After I posted this I did some looking to see where the OP might have gotten this terminology from and I think what they really mean is "import" vs "sweep".
Basically if you import the keys to the offline wallet then there is no transfer at all on the blockchain and it is therefore instant and free.  So you are just making a second copy of the wallet on your offline device, the original wallet still exists and if it is compromised your bitcoins can be stolen from there.  When you sweep, you create a new wallet and transfer the coins to it, leaving the original wallet with no balance.  This is more secure, since you now only have 1 wallet to protect, but you have to pay the transfer fee to actually do the transfer.

The bar for segwit was set at 95% because it is a pretty obvious technical improvement and the people who implemented it didn't expect a massive campaign against it by a well funded group attacking it for no readily identifiable reason.
Segwit is opt-in on every level.  Don't want to use it in your wallet, then don't.  Don't want to mine segwit style blocks, then don't.  The only reason 95% was chosen was to try to show that the community was united and to avoid even the slightest possible risk of a chain split.  Now a chain split is likely anyway, so lets move forward and quit wasting time.

I don't like how it came about any more than you do, but this is the wrong hill to die on.  The miners made a damn good play with their backroom deal and we came out on the losing side of this one.  It means our only sane option is to accept it and move forward.  This does not mean we like the deal, and it damn sure doesn't mean we will let this happen again.
It means we lick our wounds, and move forward having learned a painful, but valuable, lesson about how to operate in the future.  This will be the last time the miners will be given veto power over something the community wants.
Everyone is worried about "setting a precedent" by accepting segwit2x.  The only precedent that will be set is that we won't be forced into this position again.  They won this round, this is not the last round, but it will be if we force a chain split.

It's not about losing money, it is about how people view us and our idea of a currency.  Look up Beenz, or Flooz, and see what their failure did to the idea of digital currency.  Let this fork happen and in the eyes of Joe sixpack Bitcoin is just the next failed idea like Beenz.
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:39:10
Replying to myself to add...
Don't misunderstand what I said about the core devs.  I think they have done an amazing job so far and I hope they keep doing that job going forward.  I would rather see the 2x fork happen and the core devs accept that portion and work to make it better, than to have them fight it and risk splitting the network.  I know they are worried about the scalability of bigger blocks and I think their fears are justified, but those risks need to be weighed against the risks of a chain split.
I hope they look at the risk of a chain split like they would look at a denial of service bug in the codebase, because that is what it is.  A chain split means downtime for the network, confusion for users, and the nearly guaranteed possibility of people losing money when scammers exploit users lack of knowledge of the fork to cheat them.  A chain split is a security vulnerability, a very real one, and needs to be viewed as such.
@_date: 2017-07-16 01:37:28
At one point I wanted to see a fork and them go their own way too.  In fact I wrote a post saying exactly that.  However I think things have changed since then.  At that time, they were a small group of zealots who wanted to run unlimited blocksize set entirely by the miners.
Now they want a 2mb fixed blocksize (plus segwit) and they have the majority of the exchanges and buisinesses on board with them.  We may not like it, but the situation has changed and we need to update our position to reflect this.
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:32:26
I am opposed to the 2x hardfork.  I fully support segwit and think that is the best way forward (without the 2x part), however it doesn't look like that is going to happen.  Given those facts the new best strategy is to grudgingly accept segwit2x, move forward on a single chain, and learn a painful lesson about what to do and not to do the next time we need to update the protocol.
Splitting off into multiple chains is a disaster far worse than what is proposed with the 2x plan.  I don't like it, I don't like a lot of things, but I do know when to fight and when to accept what is realistic, and right now is not the time to fight this.  Not with multiple forks.
Remember, accepting segwit2x does not mean conceding to Jihan and Ver in the future.  They may think they won or they may not, I don't know.  But what I do know is, if they ever try something like this again, they will lose big time.  That is enough.  Keep bitcoin functioning and keep it moving forward.  Fight tomorrows battles tomorrow.  Don't think that just because we didn't get everything we wanted that we got nothing.
@_date: 2017-05-10 17:37:17
Segwit is not stopping us from increasing the blocksize, it is making it safe for us to increase the blocksize.  Increasing the blocksize beofre you fix the quadratic scaling problem is really dangerous, because an attacker could mine a block that has a transaction in it that takes so long to verify that it breaks the network.
There will be no blocksize increase without segwit or something else to fix quadratic scaling first... period.

Here is a pretty decent looking overview of the details of how a transaction is structured.  I didn't read through it, just skimmed over it, but it looks like a decent introduction.  Like I said, definitely worth taking a bit of time to learn if you have much money stored in BTC.
Although you don't really need to learn this stuff to use the system, it is worth knowing to avoid running into problems down the road.
@_date: 2017-05-07 23:44:13
I am kind of surprised that there aren't mining pools already offering this.  ViaBTC has their transaction accelerator, why don't the pools just put up a form on a webpage where you can paste a raw transaction that will only be given to them (or to other segwit supporting pools).
I don't send many transactions, but if such a service were offered I would use it and I would include a higher fee than I normally do; and I would be happy to do it.  r/btc likes to complain that no one really wants segwit, and that we are all just a bunch of sock puppet accounts.  Let's prove them wrong.
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:57:03
I understand your point and I don't want to see the price crash if it doesn't have to, but this situation is becoming untenable.  We are not at a crisis like they claim we are, but we do need segwit eventually to move on to larger usage (like 10 or 100 times more usage).
If we are going to have to UASF anyway, might as well do it and be done with it.  Why wait for the sake of waiting when waiting is exactly what they want us to do.  Don't reward them for their shitty behaviour, crush them into a fine powder as an example to the next bunch of pricks who decide to try the same crap.
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:21:05
If they want larger blocks so badly then fork the chain and start mining them.  The mempool has a ton of transactions in it.  They claim there is this huge group of people who want larger blocks, so why wait.
A chain split is dangerous at 51% and its dangerous at 75%.  Either way you have a substantial group of miners on the other chain.  So lets see them do it, lets see if they have the courage of their conviction.  Lets see them actually try their experiment and see how well it works, instead of pontificating about how great it would be if only they were in charge.
Say what you want about core, but at least the things they do matter.  The code they write gets used in production on the real network.  BU write code that "signals" for the fork, but until they actually fork it is just wishful thinking.
If core screws up their code, it has real consequences, if BU screws up they just handwave it away because at the end of the day no one that actually matters is running their shitty code, only "signalling" for it.
@_date: 2017-05-10 19:20:37
That patch doesn't do what you claimed it does.  First of all it allows up to 32 mb blocks, rather than the 2 mb we both discussed.  Secondly, there is no flag day for activation.  Applying that patch would activate it immediately, but only on nodes running that code.  Doing so would immediately split the network if any miner ran it, just like when BU mined the invalid block that was too big.  Code for something like this is more complicated than changing a couple of defines and calling it good.
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:23:46
Exactly.  The line will be "trust us, we won't let our system break down like those crazy anarchists did with theirs, just use our centralized blockchain and you don't have to worry."
There is a difference between cutting your losses and living to fight another day, instead of going down with the ship.  Lets put this scaling situation behind us and move forward.  There will be problems, but they will be solved and bitcoin will live on.

Not everything that happens sets a precedent.  Just because we accept 2x doesn't mean we have to accept everything miners propose going forward.  We know a lot more about how to deploy upgrades now than we did a year ago, and the next time upgrades are proposed they will be done in full knowledge of the mess the miners caused this time.
That is the precedent that is being set.  Don't confuse acceptance of 2x with acquiescence.
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:55:14
I support it, but I don't think it matters.  If segwit2x locks in then they enforce segwit on all new blocks just like bip148 does, so either bip148 does nothing because segwit2x is already doing it anyway, or it splits off with a tiny hashrate and little to no economic support (since all the major exchanges back 2x).
I don't think bip148 "failed" because I think that is why we are getting segwit, but it looks like the 2x is coming along with it.  We can either accept it, or basically burn down the system.  I say we accept it, as much as we don't like it, we really have no sane choice to not.

It depends on how many other transactions are waiting in the mempool to be cleared and what fee was paid on the transaction compared to the others currently waiting.  People paying the highest fees get processed first.  The mempool has been fairly empty the last few days but I see a bunch of transactions coming in now, so it may be a while depending on how far back in the line you are.

The mempool is not a defined thing.  Different nodes have different rules about what they allow into their mempool and how long they keep it there.  Every node has minimum tx fee rules for allowance into its mempool, etc.  This is to keep someone from ddossing the network with low or 0 fee tx's that never confirm.  So if your settings are different your mempool size is different.
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:01:28
I wouldn't worry.
That just means the transaction is unconfirmed.  The bit about the low fee might not be correct, fees went up very quickly and then back down very quickly so fee estimation is really difficult right now.
If you want an estimate on when it will confirm look up the transaction id on a site like blockchain.info
Once you have that pulled up, look at the fee in sat/byte (satoshi's per byte) and then see where you fall on this chart.  
Each block that gets mined (every 10 minutes) eats about 1 mb off the bottom chart, and when it digs down to the level where that your transaction paid it should clear.

I go by what the code says.  The code says it goes to 2 and stays there.  Yes, the could propose anything, that is not relevant though.  What is relevant is what proposed changes have enough support behind them to cause a significant split in the network.  This one does, and I am saying that the damage it will cause is less than what the split would cause, so the logical choice is to accept the proposal, even if we don't like how we got here.
Accepting this does not mean we have to accept everything they offer in the future.

You don't need to do anything special to get coins on both sides of the split, just having them in a wallet you have the private keys for (like electrum, core, etc) is enough.
A split is very unlikely, though.  Lots of bluster about it but when it comes right down to it I don't think people will let it happen.

I think the analogy fails because going to 2mb blocks is fundamentally different than increasing the number of coins.  Like it or not, the 2x fork has a lot of support.  Hard to say exactly how much, but it is definitely enough that a split would be very nasty.  That is all I am saying, that the damage done by forking would be more than the damage caused by 2x.

Someone looked at how long coins sat at a particular address before being transferred to a new one.  There is a clear pattern in this dataset indicative of a massive and long running spam attack on the network.
It is thought that just such an attack was being run as an excuse to force people to use a larger blocksize, and now we have evidence of an attack.

If they sell to people in the US or take advantage of the protection of the US legal system in any way (like a patent or a trademark) then they are under the jurisdiction of US law and the SEC can come after them.
If they are truly foreign and have no interaction with the US or its citizens then they are safe from the SEC, but the SEC is not the only organization in the world that regulates securites.  Every country with any sizeable financial sector has their own SEC.

No, it is down to the specifics of how transactions are built by your wallet software.  Basically there are quite a few different ways to craft a transaction, some are more secure against certain types of attacks but take more space on the blockchain.  So it is a tradeoff depending on which type your wallet decides to make.
