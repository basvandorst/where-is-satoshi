Haha wow, I honestly don't know whether to laugh or cry.

C'mon don't hate, I get legitimately excited if I get to use an out-of-the ordinary (for me) turn of phrase.  It's like when a birder spots a rare Taiwanese Megadodo or whatever.  And "paupers" is a word I've probably never used or even heard someone say in real life, so I just thought it was worth a nod.
@_date: 2016-08-18 05:09:58
I can tell we are from different walks of life, but I have to give you props for working the word "paupers" into a sentence.  My linguistic highlight today was Pyrrhic victory in the context of a Risk game.

I'm extremely suspicious of these neighbors, who seem to prioritize social interaction over mobile devices.

I'm just saying I enjoy how whimsical Internet English has become. The fact that "Because I never." and "so few fucks" are widely recognized and accepted phrases is hilarious and awesome.  I just think it's cool how we deliberately twist the language in interesting ways.

This is fantastic! I would definitely buy some tea from you, but goodness I seriously cannot afford to pay that kind of coin for 15 grams!

Yep. Same.

Yeah that sucks, but I suppose if you think of it in terms of the long term potential the hundred dollar differential probably doesn't hurt as bad.
I screwed up too though... I made my first Coinbase purchase at 460, but I only bought .1 thinking I'd wait and see how the east coast reacted to Mt. Gox in the morning. I didn't realize that you couldn't have multiple orders open until after your first one goes all the way through.  So now I have to wait two more days before I can buy again.

Heh, this reminds me of the "web 2.0" era circa 2k9, when every website had an animated tag cloud in the sidebar.

I'll take it. I'm just picking up a tiny bit every paycheck and holding.  I'm such a little noobfish.

Same. I was in the middle of a really good book, and have barely picked it up since Gox halted withdrawals.

I have a question that's probably unanswerable... I want to pick up a little bit more BTC sometime in the next day or two.  You guys think I should pull the trigger right now, or do you think there will be a downward correction after the huge increase we saw in the past 24 hours?  I'm ready to buy and hold, but if I can buy a bit cheaper I'd rather wait.

Exchanges like this are why Internet is hands-down the best English dialect.

It's not irrelevant if people are interested, and people are interested.  Whether or not it *matters* who Satoshi is, his story and mystique are very, very intriguing.
Plus the dragon hoard of bitcoin he's sitting on.

Hehe, I have to admit I have no idea what that means.  I'm not a programmer and don't actually know PHP : )

Yeah same.  Haha I'm totally a reddit noob and hadn't seen SubredditDrama before... love it.

Man all these theories are crazy.  I'm having more fun reading about Bitcoin these days than I am reading fiction.  
That post yesterday where Chris Lamprecht showed up felt like I was in the middle of a Neal Stephenson yarn.

What I gleaned from /bitcoinmarkets was that a whale placed a 2700 coin buy order to pump the price, and then someone dumped 900 coins at 605ish, which sent it back down.  Sounds like it's pure manipulation, although I really know nothing.  Someone correct me if I'm off base here, I'm trying to better understand how the short term fluctuations occur.
@_date: 2014-03-04 07:40:57
Not bad, not bad.

Nevertheless, the wording is definitely clumsy enough for it to be funny.
But not as bad as that Tiger Direct customer support rep that suggested a customer "will have to call Bitcoin" to resolve a query.

+1 Romans theory.  Writing fanfic immediately.
We're talking about *ancient* Romans, right? Because I'm talking about ancient Romans.  Virgil created Bitcoin and all of the private keys are stashed in the Aeneid.

Are you talking about reference tooltips?  You can literally turn that off in two clicks.  And it took me ten seconds to find that out.

I was thinking the same thing.  The lowercase b doesn't make any sense.

Gates usually holds his manhunts on the Olympic Peninsula now.  There's a parade and everything when the yacht pulls into Port Angeles, and they shut the National Park down for like a week while he and his cronies play predator.  It's really quite a spectacle.

If it makes you feel better, I really don't think we'll put him in office.  There are supreme court seats at stake, which ultimately will be far more important for the next couple decades than the current presidential election. 
Even the democrats who hate Hillary will have that in mind on election day, and will swallow their pride and vote for Hillary if it means a Democrat gets to make two SC nominations.  I know there's a lot of time left, but she is tracking way ahead in the general election polls.

Honestly, it was way easier to get going with Coinbase than Paypal.  There was a long stretch where I pretty much considered PayPal the worst UX I had ever encoutered. That was like 10 years ago though, I'm sure it's improved.
