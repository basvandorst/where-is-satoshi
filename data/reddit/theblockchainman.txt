No but people in the developed world should.

This is retarded. They already have debit cards you can fund with bitcoin and spend like any other debit card (for example). What is the difference between simply getting a debit card you can fund with bitcoin and finding some other third party that you can send bitcoin to who will then buy whatever through some other payment channel?
Much ado about nothing here.

Insurance... banking... same same.

Yes I pay for my own healthcare for more than a decade. 
Quit being a parasite. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:22:20
AXA for one

What kind of diamond? You can probably find 1 carat diamonds for anywhere between $500 to $25000 spending on color, cut and clarity.

It’s Winestainberg.

Bankers are all criminals. Blockstream is in bed with bankers. There’s plenty of scum to go round.

Surprised, not surprised. Is there a worse exchange?
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:21:29
We don’t need to concern ourselves about what this cousin fucking camel raper thinks.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:34:15
Fuck that Lawsky guy right in the ear!
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:59:02
Great idea, disincentivize people from providing healthcare.
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:58:36
Lol! Good question. But that kinda is the question isn’t it?
@_date: 2017-10-17 11:22:56
What’s mpeso?
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:20:51
Also curious how much electricity Facebook and Instagram and Twitter and Snapchat and other frivolous bullshit use...
@_date: 2017-10-17 11:26:32
You seem woefully ignorant of true inflation.

No it doesn’t. The variables besides the size (carat) are color, cut and clarity.  Very good color is referred to as “colorless” grade d, not “white”.  Even among 1 carat grade d colorless diamonds there will be considerable variance in price based on clarity and cut.

Somebody that needs to buy something at that moment.

You ask your wife for permission? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:39:35


You got the first part right.


This one, not so much.
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:56:02
Maybe something that’s not for douchebags will start accepting bitcoin soon...
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:53:16
Cryptopia is better. Liqui.io maybe.  But as far as incompetency, scumbaggery and general shittiness goes, Kraken is hard to beat.
I’d say bitfinex and while they’re total fraudsters at least their exchange *works* when you place an order!
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:59:29
Was this just kraken or was it more widespread? What caused it?
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:59:09
Hope it’s not Fake Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:18:16
Who’s the third asshole?
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:30:08
HODL half!
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:13:15
Screwing the users *again* by lopping off **another** decimal place? is truly a despicable bunch!
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:57:01
Hopefully not giving any of them away to this douchebag store!
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:36:56
This is not an example of a direct exchange, can you read? If it was a direct exchange OP would not be involved at all!
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:40:25
Shouldn’t bitcoin gold be the retarded one?
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:00:10
I want to know too!
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:25:18
This guy is right!
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:04:21
What hardware are they using and where/how do they get it?
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:55:32
No by that I mean literally paid **in cash** �� for all medical expenses.
You parasites really hate it when people try to take away your free (read: stolen) stuff don’t you?
