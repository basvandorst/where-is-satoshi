And while that loud and very vocal minority is pushing a solution to increase the limit to 6 tx/sec (*scaling!*), Blockstream is pushing solutions for ~1,000,000+ tx/sec *and even doing so with lower costs to nodes*.


who are just as responsible for splintering the community.  Both camps have made their arguments and many (including the majority control of the hashpower) have agreed to stick with Core.

But wouldn't a hard fork have required *everyone* (miners, wallets, exchanges, nodes, etc.) to upgrade?  Considering how slow some of the exchanges are at upgrading, it's probably better that it was done as a soft-fork or it would have been even longer before *anybody* could use it.

How do you know that 100 BTC hasn't been transacted 1000 times today?
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:52:09
Please correct me if I'm wrong, but Ethereum hasn't actually fixed the problem of scaling, it just allows more transactions on-chain.  This means lower fees at the cost of increased chain size.  From a quick search, an Ethereum "archival node" requires [over 300 GB of data going back to 2015]( in contrast to the Bitcoin equivalent "full node" which has [~150 GB of data going back to 2009](  With pruning, both chains seem to be around ~20-30 GB.  Ethereum has taken the move fast and break things approach, while Bitcoin seems to take the slow and steady approach.


If transaction rates were the only important factor in valuing a cryptocurrency, then why does Bitcoin currently have a ~$200 billion market cap, and Ethereum only a ~$70 billion market cap?  If transaction rate is all that matters, then shouldn't we all just switch to Paypal, Venmo, or Visa?
@_date: 2018-09-13 00:17:30
I agree with you; sidechains would have separate protocols from the main chain.  No reason to bog down the main chain and bitcoin protocol with stuff that could be implemented as a sidechain.  The main chain just needs to support 'trustless pegging' between the chains.
@_date: 2018-09-12 23:12:16
Couldn't all of that eventually be done with sidechains tied back into the bitcoin main chain?
@_date: 2018-09-14 01:13:27
I think I agree with you for the most part, but I just don't see the need for other coins when you could do what they do but with bitcoin.  The Bitcoin core developers wouldn't need to focus on implementing all that functionality either.  If trustless two-way pegging between the main chain and sidechains could be implemented, others could work on developing the sidechains -- similar to how the Lightning Network is being developed by different teams separate from Bitcoin core.
@_date: 2015-06-28 20:19:36
You make very good points.  What I'm proposing is merely a method to allow miners to weigh in on the debate when consensus cannot be reached by the developers.  The developers must still include the BIPs in the code, but having proven support from the miners could help to expedite the process without the political debates hindering development.
Edit: More accurately, it would be a voting system for pool operators.
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:38:48
You are right, this voting system would not account for exchanges, wallets, etc.  Only the miners would be represented using this system, however, I'm only proposing this method as a means of soft voting - with no actual code adoption required to place a vote.
The goal would be moving towards consensus without risking a fatal hard fork.  If there is overwhelming support from the miners, this should trigger action towards implementing changes to code in Bitcoin core and exchange/wallet software, etc.  This would also encourage the core developers to provide formal BIPs for protocol changes.
It seems to me, most of the developers support a blocksize increase, but it is the method that is disputed.  While I absolutely agree with you, hard forks should be avoided when unnecessary, it seems a hard fork will be necessary to adapt bitcoin to support future growth.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:24:46
BCH is credited to accounts separately from Bitcoin.  Selling one does not mean selling the other, they are two separate coins.
@_date: 2015-06-28 20:40:46
I suppose you may be right, but from the sidelines, the debate appears to be taking a negative toll on the developers' and community morale.
My greatest fear in this situation is a halt to development as everyone becomes fixated on the blocksize debate.
@_date: 2015-06-28 19:43:24
Yes, I believe this would be a Proof-of-Stake style voting system.
@_date: 2015-06-28 19:26:52
I think using Proof-of-Stake could possibly work as a system for voting on changes to the bitcoin protocol, but I don't believe this would accurately represent normal users though.  PoS would still concentrate voting power to entities controlling many coins, i.e. exchanges, mining pools, and wealthy individuals.
@_date: 2015-06-28 19:38:46
I do not believe minority stakeholders should dominate policy of majority stakeholders, nor do I believe PoW voting (i.e. allowing the miners to vote based on hashing power) enables this.  A miner's stake is represented by their hashing power.  Miners with the greatest hashing power would be considered the largest stakeholders and their votes would be weighed accordingly.  Perhaps I am not understanding your post?

@_date: 2015-06-28 17:44:42
Merging controversial code to Bitcoin core such as increasing the blocksize seems to require an excessive amount of effort and energy.  While it is good significant effort is required to make drastic changes to the core, it seems to have negative effects on the community and collaboration between the developers.  A system for easing this process, such as soft voting, seems as though it would be beneficial for future development of bitcoin.  I guess what I'm suggesting is more of a bureaucratic change, and not so much of a change to the behavior of bitcoin.  I would consider what you describe as a hard voting system, as it directly leads to changes in the behavior of bitcoin.

Yes, you can use Electrum ( to generate your seed (list of ~13 words) from an **offline** computer.  Consider booting and generating the seed from a clean bootable flash drive if you have the means.  Write the seed down and store it in a safe and secure place.  Be careful if you decide to print it, some printers have internal storage and will "remember" what you've printed.  IMO, it's much safer to just write the seed down with a pen or pencil (or both).
When storing your word seed lists, consider the possibility of damage from floods, fire, and theft.  You may want to seal them up in plastic bags before storing them away in a fireproof safe if you have access to one.  If you want to get a little more advanced, look into generating multisignature wallets to further mitigate risks.
Try storing and redeeming a small amount from cold storage to test your process.  It's really up to you how important this $4000 is to you and how many precautions you should take.  For me, the peace of mind gained from doing a little extra is absolutely priceless!  Good luck!

That users want SegWit would be a perfectly good reason for miners to want SegWit as well.  It is the users (investors and speculators, businesses, etc.) that give Bitcoin value.
Regarding LN, the miners would absolutely see the anchor transactions and their attached fees.  Besides, it's not like everyone will suddenly just switch to using the LN if SegWit is activated.

@_date: 2017-02-05 07:47:29
No, you would be replacing the current miners with new miners.
So for example, the current miners all mine a PoW based on SHA256.  Basically your number of "votes" as a miner is determined by how quickly you can solve the SHA256-based PoW.  Most miners today have specialized ASICs that can solve the SHA256 PoW quickly and efficiently, but these ASICs are only good at solving this PoW and nothing else.
But if we change the consensus rules so that "votes" are determined by how quickly you can solve some other PoW, say scrypt, then those ASICs are useless for the new chain.  Of course there would be two chains now (hence a hard fork), and whichever chain survives is to be determined by whichever chain is valued most at the exchanges -- i.e. the chain that the users choose to back.
**Edit:** To clarify my answer to your question, if nodes change their PoW consensus rules, they could create a fork without the current miners.  They would listen to a new set of miners solving scrypt instead (using the earlier example).
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:26:23
The miners would start the fork when they activate changes to the consensus code.  Who starts the fork is unrelated to amount of hash power on the resulting chains.
Hence Core miners would be activating a soft fork when activating SegWit, and BU miners would be activating a hard fork [when activating BU].
**Edit** [in brackets] for clarity.
@_date: 2017-02-05 17:48:47

The miners may be incentivized to see bitcoin succeed, but that does not mean the are incentivized to keep bitcoin decentralized.  It is up to the users to push for a decentralized bitcoin network and oppose centralization.

You can't build an educated view by reading *either subreddit alone*.  At this time, I don't see news of Telco214 signalling SegWit on the other subreddit.  Both subreddits are biased and suppress the opposition's viewpoints, which I think is probably natural human behavior.
I think one's opinion of the the competing clients should be primarily based on the technical implications of the code, not the perceived personalities, surrounding politics, and mudslinging.  Otherwise your opinion becomes vulnerable to conspiracy theories and false flag attacks -- something that's not easily detected through internet forums.

Does that make SegWit bad?  Roger Ver owns the Bitcoin.com pool and is [funding Bitcoin Unlimited](  Does that make BU bad?
Blockchain Capital seems to be investing in a lot of [blockchain related companies]( including Coinbase whose CEO (Brian Armstrong) was [very supportive of Bitcoin Classic](
It might also be of interest to know that Blockstream has [many investors]( which none have direct control over the protocol.  Why is it that funding the bitcoin protocol has become something to spite?  Several years ago, funding full time programmers to work on the protocol would have been seen as a gift to the community.  Even the BU developers have sought funding.
@_date: 2017-02-05 06:44:11
No, changing the PoW would effectively be "firing" the miners for new ones.  It would be a hard fork creating a chain that current ASIC miners would no longer be able to mine on.  There would be two resulting coins, the coin the original miners sustain, and a new coin with new miners.  The coin that survives would be the one with the economic backing of the users.  Of course, there are negative side effects for everyone.  It's the nuclear option in the event miners perceivably become hostile towards bitcoin.
**Edit:** word
@_date: 2016-01-24 19:17:07
It seems to me the wasted energy concerns are overblown.  Miners should only continue to increase hashpower as long as it's profitable to them.  Right now we should expect excess hashpower due to the premium paid to miners (i.e. the block reward), but as this premium declines, the hashpower should converge with what is supported only by transaction fees.  The system is designed as a free market, where those with the most efficient mining hardware ($/Watt) should prevail.
And while the hashrate surpasses 1 Exahash, this doesn't imply a dramatic increase in power consumption.  As new, more efficient mining hardware enters the market, older, more power hungry hardware should be phased out.
This is my understanding of how the system was designed.
@_date: 2017-02-07 06:31:07
But SegWit does come with a capacity increase.
@_date: 2015-05-25 20:31:38
I think reducing confirmation times to something like 1-minute blocks  and reducing the block reward to 1/10 of the original reward is a good idea.  Instead of having to download a 20MB block every ~10 minutes, nodes would download a 2MB block every minute, more evenly distributing bandwidth requirements over the block periods.  Some discussion from a previous post on reducing block times with input from Gavin: [1-minute blocks](
I'm not entirely sold on an algorithmic approach to determining the block bounds.  Sure, the smaller miners could keep the block size low by including fewer transactions, but this means they must omit transactions (and fees) that could just be included in the next block by a larger miner trying to game the system.  I'm not against the idea, just wary of potential side effects.
@_date: 2017-02-05 20:46:14
I think someone else has already put it quite succinctly.
Bitcoin Unlimited supporters are primarily concerned with reducing fees.

I believe there are other options in addition to increasing block sizes and SW/LN though too.

Yes, but the attacker must also buy hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin to own those blocks.  This would likely cause a dramatic increase in price, eventually pricing themselves out of a successful attack.  Unless, of course, they've already accrued large quantities of bitcoin.  Then I suppose we would just have to wait until they spend it all.
It seems as though a lot of the recent transaction volume is using extremely low fees though.  I'm skeptical the situation is as dire as many recent posts claim.

I like the idea, but couldn't this lead towards large miners increasing pressure on small miners by constantly maxing out the block size and therefore increasing bandwidth requirements?  This seems like it *could* be gamed and lead towards a more centralized network.  I think whatever solution is chosen for increasing the block limit, it should leave no vulnerabilities in the network.

This is already implemented in bitcoin and is what most refer to as the fee market.  This incident shows the fee market works as intended.


I don't see any connection with blacklists.  People may spam the blockchain with whatever transactions they wish as long as they are willing to pay the fee.


Supply can be increased in ways other than just increasing the block size.  We could also reduce the size overhead of transactions and allow more transactions to fit in the same space.  I agree, eventually the block size will need to be increased, but this may not be as urgent as some are proclaiming just yet.

I like the idea of a fixed growth schedule of 17.7% per year.  It is simple and predictable.
I do not like the suggestion to reduce the current block size to 300k, nor do I believe the provided rationale sufficiently argues for this limit.  Is there data to support the claims in the Motivation and Rationale sections, e.g. "the current rate of blockchain growth is demonstratably too high for many users" and "the total cost to sync a new node for the first time is growing significantly faster than technology improvements"?  I agree these issues require serious consideration, but I do not understand why 300k is an acceptable starting point, and something like 1MB is unacceptable.  Is there a target node count the author wants the network to reach?

But don't full nodes still need to download the witness data? :


The witness data would put full blocks at 4MB and 8MB respectively.  I agree this requires most transactions in the block to utilize SegWit.
@_date: 2017-08-08 02:58:56
And every time someone wants to spin up a new node they have to download and verify 130 gigabytes of data.  A year from today it would be 180 gigabytes, *without* Segwit or a 2x block increase.
We're going to have to increase the block size eventually, I don't think anyone disagrees with that.  But why increase the burden on the network when there are still so many other tools we can use to increase transaction throughput with far lower costs?  A simple block size increase provides just a small improvement to transaction throughput (~3 txn/sec to ~6 txn/sec), and *all of the associated costs* to nodes.

@_date: 2017-08-18 17:34:58
I think Core wants to see how Segwit goes before committing to a hard fork that merely doubles the block size.  It's the 2X hard fork part of btc1 that risks splitting the coin, not Core.  And what would we get out of the 2X hard fork?  The can just gets kicked a couple feet further down the road and the network risks losing nodes as the max block size increases from **~2MB** (Segwit) to **~4MB** (SegwitX2).  And then we find ourselves in the same situation a year from now, risking another chain split as another controversial hard fork is pushed on to the community.  So why not just see what SegWit is capable of first?  -- and maybe avoid a couple chain splits down the road too.
**Edit:**  Thank you for the correction.

Your first comment said "Any tx with a fee" and nothing about outbidding other transactions to be included in a block.  We are looking at a graph of the mempool where many of the transactions may never be included in a block because the fees they pay are so low.  And even if they are included in a block, it doesn't necessarily mean they outbid any other transactions as it's possible there was simply excess space in the block for them to be included.

Perhaps 'indisputable' was too strong a word.  But I don't believe anyone has provided convincing evidence beyond ridiculous conspiracy theories of Blockstream having malicious intentions.  Blockstream is guilty of nothing more than any other VC funded company -- with the exception of having a differing scaling proposal than what certain parts of the community would prefer.  
In fact, Blockstream hasn't even *forced* anything on the community.  This entire time, we've had the option to change clients and fork the blockchain, yet enough of the community has decided to stay with Core to prevent a fork thus far.  Even activating SegWit requires enormous consensus and compromise from the community.

Okay, so the article linked in the comment you quoted does confirm that Nielsen's law measures bandwidth for just high end users (meaning users with access to high end connections):


* a high-end user's connection speed grows by 50% per year
According to the article, these high end users would be those who in "about 2003" ... "had speeds corresponding to a personal T-1 line".  Today, those users would be those with "240 Mbps" connections.
So our disagreement is simply a matter of opinion.  I don't believe only those with the fastest connections should be node operators as this sort of policy would quickly eliminate the TOR nodes, and possibly a good chunk of personal home nodes.
But you do make a good point, that the high end tech filters down.  And I also agree that the rise of mobile phone internet access has probably skewed the results presented in Rusty's analysis.
For these reasons, I would prefer assuming conservative future bandwidth availability (~20% block size growth per year), and push another fork at a later time to revise for excess growth, or perhaps just roll-out a long-term fork with a 25-35% annual block size increase.
I would like to see more ideas and proposals on this topic though, as a fixed annual increase in block size is currently my preferred scaling route.  It could be implemented in code simply, and it would behave very predictably, allowing node operators to prepare well in advance for block size adjustments.

If you're conservative at first, but later find out technology permits more, then you could certainly push another block size increase (probably even using a soft fork if you implement the capability in the first HF) at a later time.  If you're too liberal early on with the block size increase, you can't simply remove those blocks from the blockchain at a later time.  The damage is done and there's no going back.  This entire debate is basically about trading off security for capacity and vice versa.

I'm not sure how you are defining "high end users" (users with high end connections?  or technically savvy users?) but I don't believe this statement is true.  There exists technically savvy users who cannot afford or do not have access to top of the line internet access.
You may have meant only users with access to high end connections should be node operators.  However, I do not share this opinion.  We should strive for decentralization, not just in terms of number of nodes, but also in terms of number of unique ISPs.  If the majority of nodes only exist across a few high end ISPs, it would not be difficult for state actors to demand those ISPs filter node traffic.  Then just DoS the rest of the network.

I'll do my best to answer your question: 


Cons of SegWit:
- Many critics of a SegWit soft fork is that the code is too complex and adds 'technical debt' to the bitcoin codebase. 
- SegWit doesn't offer an immediate ~2MB increase.  Wallet developers need to update their software to support SegWit.
- Political reasons (As many others here have already pointed out).  There are those who do not want the network to run on software developed by Core.
Pros of block size increase: 
- A simple block size increase requires fewer changes to the codebase with little complexity relative to other solutions. 
- A block size increase, once activated by the network, would increase the block size immediately.
Disclaimer:  At this time I'm biased in favor of SegWit/Core.  I hope you'll still find my answers helpful.

But it depends on the goal of the spammer.  Is the goal of the spammer to raise the costs for normal users to transact across the network?  Then yes, this is easier with smaller blocks.  Is the goal of the spammer to bloat the blockchain?  Well, larger blocks would make this easier.
So we can never increase the block size and the network will never be capable of more than 3txn/sec?!  No.  We can reduce the cost of maintaining the blockchain for nodes.  SegWit (SF or HF) does this as well as several other proposals (LN, Schnorr, MimbleWimble sidechain, etc.).  And over time, technological advancements at the hardware level (optical fibre connections, RAM, etc.) will also allow us to increase the block size!
But hard drives are already cheap and continuing to decline in price! - And that's why pretty much nobody is suggesting hard drive space is an issue.  UTXO set size, bootstrapping new nodes, nation-wide firewalls, miner centralization, etc. are far more important concerns at this time.

Increased adoption does not necessarily mean more nodes.  In recent years we have seen increased adoption, yet the node count has reduced to just ~5k nodes.  Before SPV wallets, this number was an estimated ~100k nodes.  Introducing technical changes to the software (e.g. SPV wallet support) has historically affected the node count.  Increasing the cost to run a node is more likely to reduce the total node count than increase the total node count.
@_date: 2016-12-06 21:07:56
But if you increase the block size such that their is additional space (a surplus if you will), then the fee to have a *normal* transaction accepted declines.
This also means that the *spam* transactions are competing with lower fee txns, which means the spammer can reduce the fees attached to his transactions as well, and still have them accepted into the blockchain.
**If you reduce the fees for normal users, you reduce the fees for spammers too.**
So what are the consequences of this?  You've reduced the fees for normal users (this is good!).  You've also reduced the fees for the spammer AND you've increased the amount of spam the spammer can push into the blockchain (this is bad!).

I would assume this as well, at least to some degree, but over the past couple years the growth seems to be mostly negligible, despite an increasing number of transactions and online wallets.


Some more nodes may pop up, but as the blockchain grows it becomes increasingly difficult to bootstrap new nodes.  Right now a new node operator needs to download ~93 GB of data (and of course validate the chain) to start a new node.  Let's not allow the blockchain to grow so large that we need to share our home address to have a copy of it on Blu-ray mailed to us.  The goal should not be to wait until we need the nodes, but to be prepared for the worst far in advance.

This seems like a pretty reasonable proposal to me.  I'm not a huge fan of the quadrennial block reward decrease schedule because it seems like a very abrupt adjustment to make periodically.  I think it would have been more elegant to smooth the adjustment over time, but I'm also not really up in arms over the matter.  Point being, there may be advantages to smoothing the block size increase over smaller periods as well.  I like your idea more than the bulk of other proposals out there right now though.
I'm a huge fan of SegWit, and preferably the SF ASAP because it has been thoroughly reviewed and is ready to go.  I think the fixes and optimizations SegWit proposes are better introduced before a block size increase rather than after.  However, I do hope the community can come to an agreement and find a compromise to increase the block size as well.
@_date: 2016-12-15 23:59:06
Perhaps I didn't understand your statement clearly, and so maybe you could clarify.
From your post you seem to suggest those who want to increase the block size were seen as "an enemy/opponent of Bitcoin" [and would be downvoted], "but if you follow Core's path you are a friend/supporter of Bitcoin" [and would be upvoted].
Your post isn't entirely clear to me though.

Couldn't sidechains also eventually serve as alternate ledgers backed by *the* Bitcoin blockchain?  From what I understand, Mimblewimble avoids many of the scaling issues Bitcoin faces today and it could be implemented as a sidechain.  I'm not too familiar with progress on this possibility though.
@_date: 2016-12-08 23:59:48


I think this might be slightly off topic from the original discussion that we were having, in which I was contending thezerg1's claim that most "small blockers" want 1 MB forever.


I think this crowd would be *even smaller* than the 1 MB forever crowd, which I'm claiming is already a *very tiny* part of the "small blockers" crowd, because changing the block size requires forking the protocol.


'Absurdly' is a bit subjective, and so I have to ask you to clarify what you believe qualifies as "absurdly fearful of centralization".


Again, "weak computers" is subjective here.  I might argue that most "small blockers" in fact do not believe that all "weak computers" should be able to run as full nodes -- but of course we might have differing opinions on what is considered a "weak computer".

I agree, and that's why this isn't my criteria for "everything" in life.  I don't see red flags either, *maybe* yellow flags.  From what I can see, Blockstream's plan is very protective of the fundamental attributes that make bitcoin valuable -- the one exception being 0-cost fees, which is arguably of lesser importance than the other attributes as there already exists many services that offer such transactions.


Please state the "end result" that you are implying is apparent here.


It seems to me that you are implying Blockstream is stalling progress.  But they, in conjunction with Core, have produced a solution (SegWit).  It seems that parts of the community want to stigmatize Core for carefully developing, testing, and reviewing consensus critical code before release.
@_date: 2016-12-08 20:39:43
Yet nobody has been able to produce indisputable evidence that Blockstream is trying to destroy bitcoin for their own gain.  Many will typically just counter with "Well you can't prove they aren't evil!" which is ridiculous because we could make the same argument about the BU devs.
Blockstream was funded by the venture capitalist arms of several banks as a consulting company.  Guess who else has received funding from banks?  Coinbase, Circle, BitPay, 21.co, and the list goes on.  Does that mean they're all evil?  No, it means people see opportunities in this sector and they want to fund it's development. 
If the banks actually felt threatened by bitcoin, they would be far more effective in destroying it by purchasing 10% of the network hash power and stalling any improvements to the network.  They might even be able to earn a small return in the process by taking out short positions and selling the mined coins on exchanges. 
Edit: nonsensical wording ("in doing so" -&gt; "in destroying it")

I think one reason is to minimize the number of hard forks.  SegWit soft fork now, then flex cap hard fork (+ maybe a few other things on the HF wishlist) later.  If you hard fork to just 2MB now, then you're inevitably going to require another hard fork down the road when 2MB is no longer sufficient.
@_date: 2018-06-01 01:03:29
I think the business part is giving balloon tours.  Pretty neat!
@_date: 2016-12-08 22:13:58


Okay, that's fair -- although I don't personally believe *most* small blockers want to keep blocks at 1 MB (the current baseline) forever.  There may be a very *small* minority that feel this way -- but I think it's far from a majority or "most".
I'm reluctant to speak on behalf of all "small blockers", so I'll give my own opinion on increasing the block size as a "small blocker":
I think we should absolutely increase the block size, but only in a way that we can be absolutely certain that no new vulnerabilities are introduced to the network.  To me, this means we first need Segregated Witness (something that is seemingly taboo in parts of the "big blocker" crowd) to fix problems such as [this]( and to enable 2nd layer payment solutions which could help to relieve some of the transaction pressure and open up new use cases.
After SegWit, I hope the community will be able to come to a compromise on the block size issue.  I like long-term solutions such as flex cap and even simple annual step-ups that do not require complex code and are predictable.  A ~20% annual step-up seems reasonable to me, and after some brief discussions on here, I'm not opposed to a ~35% annual step-up either.  I would definitely like to see more discussion from the community on these ideas though.
If we can figure out a long-term solution to increasing the block size, maybe we can package it together with some other items from the [HF Wishlist]( as well.
But again, this is my own perspective and I would really like to see more discussion on these subjects.

Would you be able to provide a source?  I'm sure they exist, but I don't believe they are representative of most of the "small blockers" or those who oppose Classic and BU.
From what I've read, most of the opposition to Classic and BU want to increase the block size, but only in a way that we *know* with certainty new vulnerabilities will not be introduced to the network.  I think the problem with Classic, for many, was that it was a small bump from ~3 txn/sec to ~6 txn/sec.  It didn't really solve anything and it required the *entire* network to implement a hard fork -- which we would probably have to do *again* a year later.
@_date: 2016-12-08 23:08:07
I appreciate the source.  It's interesting to read what node operators have to say on the topic (both, small and large node operators).
But please read [this thread here]( and you may realize this particular node operator is concerned about bandwidth costs.  As one user pointed out, there are solutions such as compact blocks that can help reduce these costs.  There are other solutions this user could pursue as well to reduce these costs, like limiting the number of node connections and setting bandwidth limits for the node via firewalls, etc.
Note that, having been made aware of the possibility for reducing bandwidth costs, this particular node operator seemed to concede his position a bit:


Which I read to mean that increasing the block size would increase his bandwidth costs was actually a misunderstanding.

I agree you could cherry-pick the time frame of the data however you want to support your bias.  But there are no guarantees as to when the next big spike will occur.  It could be 1 year, 5, 10, or even 20 years.  So without this guarantee, you may choose to be conservative and pick your time frame accordingly.  Or, of course, you may choose to do otherwise.
I think I would prefer to be conservative and then revise the scheme later when a spike does occur.

As I understand, the reason a receiving wallet must be online 24/7 is so that you can publish a 'punish txn' if the other side of the channel publishes an *older state* of the channel, e.g. a state before you received your bitcoins.  Watchtowers would do this automatically for everyone so your mobile wallet no longer needs to remain online to monitor for old states of your channel being published.

So at the very least, he was completely unaware they were running on fractional reserves.

I assumed watchtowers would be like bitcoin full nodes which are currently ran voluntarily and users already depend on them to not forget about their address balances/utxos.  You might have several thousand watchtowers looking after your channel so you don't really have to depend on a single third party.  I also imagine the fee would be pretty low, and possibly only claimed if they detect a malicious transaction.

It's not about hard drive space.  Hard drive space is very cheap and will continue to get cheaper.  A bigger issue would be bootstrapping a new node.  If you want to start up a new node on the network, currently you would have to download and verify 140 GB of data.  That will grow much faster with increased adoption and the block size increase Segwit introduced.  Many people use ISPs which cap their data usage to less than the current size of the blockchain per month.  If they wanted to start up a new node, and do nothing else with their internet, it would take a very long time for them to do so.
And, of course, bootstrapping new nodes is just one issue.  There's also bandwidth usage, and miner centralization behind "The Great Firewall".

This was a confusing thread to read.  It seems like you just want to steer the conversation in a certain direction rather than stay on topic.  Why do you bring up accusations that miners are just a "few data centers"?  Nobody in this thread was accusing miners of being just a "few data centers" until you just brought it up.  Did you comment in the wrong thread?  He was asking for proof that  is anything more than just a private chat channel where some well-known personalities hang out.
And the hash rate distribution graph you linked to proves nothing.  A miner could easily split their hash power into multiple mining pools (that they control) and spread their hash power across multiple IP addresses.  I'm not trying to accuse them of this, but what you think is proof they are not just a "few data centers", is not really proof at all.

It's not in the miners' interest to betray users by holding back upgrades to the protocol, because it's the users that ultimately give the miners' coins value.  When the users realize the miner(s) have betrayed them, it's in the self-interest of the users to "fire" those miners.  Similarly in the prisoner's dilemma it's in everyone's long-term self-interest to cooperate.  But in this case the miner didn't cooperate.

I believe credit card companies can offer that 1-5% in rewards because they charge merchants a fee for using their service, and of course merchants just include that additional cost in the prices of the goods they sell.  I think this is also why a lot of merchants that started accepting bitcoin offer discounts when you pay with bitcoin.  They aren't charged the credit card fees and they don't have to worry about a chargeback.  Some businesses will even raise the prices of their goods to account for an expected rate of chargebacks and pass the risk off to the consumer.

This might be hard to believe, but there was a time when finding funding for full-time developers to work on the bitcoin protocol was generally desired by the community.  Now that we have this, suddenly some people are losing their shit over it and trying to twist it into something malicious.  Some employees at Blockstream contribute code to the Bitcoin Core project.  They can't control which implementation miners run, they can only provide the code.  They don't even control the repo.  You can make up all sorts of ulterior motives and conspiracy stories, but in the end, the code is what matters, and so far, Core's code has proven to be the most secure and reliable, running on more than 80% of the nodes supporting the network.
And if you want to know their scaling plan, maybe you should try looking for it first.  A simple Google search does wonders:

Supporting SegWit doesn't mean you prefer small blocks forever.  I think most of us want to increase the block size as technically feasible without detriment to the other properties that make bitcoin valuable, and not at the whim of the largest miner.
**Edit:** For those who are new to the scene and don't know who Nick Szabo is, he has been highly suspected of being Satoshi Nakamoto because he [basically conceived bitcoin back in 2008]( before it was known to the public.  I'm not suggesting we take his words as gospel (nor do I think he would want us to), but he has definitely earned the community's attention and respect.

If it ever drops to $0.01 I alone could buy them all up and then set the price for everyone else.  Unfortunately that will never happen though because someone with far more money than myself could do the same at $1.00 per coin.  Now consider the many market participants willing to corner the market combined and the price floor is even higher.
Unless there's some catastrophic failure in the protocol allowing bitcoins to be created out of thin air or bitcoins to be stolen at will, $0.00 seems pretty unrealistic.  That would imply people are trying to find others to take their coins from them -- as if storing bitcoin comes at some great cost or burden to the owner.

I think, besides the frequently discussed technical arguments associated with 2X, there is also the issue of precedents.  If a 2 MB hard fork can be pushed through with backroom deals and without community consensus then that is a glaring vulnerability.
Say a 2 MB hard fork takes over bitcoin and a year later that additional capacity is exhausted.  Well then maybe we should just hard fork again to 4 or 8 MB -- we've already forked once before despite significant community disagreement!  Rinse and repeat until the block size is so large and fees are so low we now need to find a new way to pay miners for securing the block size, lest the hashrate begins to tumble as the coin reward dries up.  How about we do a quick fork to extend the coin reward just a little longer and help keep the miners going (y'know, for security!)?
Obviously my example is a little extreme and not likely to happen (hopefully), but if a hard fork is accepted for political reasons or to favor backroom dealings then what precedent does that set for future changes to bitcoin?

Mining is an efficiency race.  As the block reward decreases, miners will need to become more efficient to stay profitable.  Currently the energy expended per transaction by miners is high because they are being subsidized by the block reward.  But over time, when they are paid primarily by transaction fees, their energy expended per transaction will decline, approaching the true cost of security per transaction.

This is kind of ridiculous.  Rather than fix the fees being paid by his own wallet he wants the entire community to hard fork.


It just seems a little egotistical to place *your time* above the concerns of the *entire ecosystem* -- especially when the problem is with your own wallet software.  And if your time is more valuable being spent on other things then clearly the fees aren't really a problem for you.


If your wallet incorrectly calculates high fees, the only way to fix that is by fixing your wallet.


The irony here is that he wants the entire ecosystem to hard fork so that he doesn't have to fix his own software.

If you convert BCH to BTC before the 2X fork (assuming the fork happens) you could have more Segwit2X coins post fork.  But there's no guarantee the fork will happen at this time.
It's also possible BCH will be pumped up again in the future and it might be nice to have some to sell in that event.  Or the price could just slowly drift lower as BCH is forgotten, possibly being overshadowed by the next BTC/Segwit2X fork.
If you're like me, and you're not very good at predicting the future, you might just want to sell/exchange your BCH slowly over time and enjoy the easy dividends.

That 0.01% of Amazon's users would have to own bitcoin *and* buy something *every day* to introduce an additional 300,000 transactions per day.  I'm guessing less than 0.01% of Amazon's users hold bitcoin, and those that do probably won't be buying something every day, 365 days a year.  The network currently handles Newegg, Overstock, and Microsoft just fine.  I'm skeptical Amazon will break bitcoin any time soon.

Ah, so block data is still *stored* as it used to be in pre-Segwit nodes, and the witness data is only relocated when calculating the transaction id?
If that is true then I misinterpreted the explanation in [this video]( and I thank you for clarifying this for me.  A quick question though:  Do Segwit-upgraded nodes store these blocks in the same way that legacy nodes store them?  If I understand correctly, the block must then be relayed to legacy nodes with a different format, otherwise legacy nodes would potentially reject the block in the event that the block is larger than 1 MB.

It is certainly a conceivable danger and it doesn't make sense to allow a successful attack before implementing safeguards.

Actually, this may not be entirely true.  The paper can be found [here]( and reads:






10 min. average block interval (or a reduction in block-interval time). A 4MB
block size corresponds to a maximum throughput of at most 27 transaction-
The paper does not recommend raising the blocksize to 4MB, it suggests the blocksize *should not exceed 4MB* -- a very important distinction.
**Edit:** To clarify further, the article says the paper suggests the block size should be raised to 4 MB.  But the paper does not suggest this.  If someone tells you the maximum capacity for a boat is 12 people,  does that mean they're suggesting you should fill the boat with 12 people?  No, they are not.

Here's one way:
1.  First move your BTC to another address using a bitcoin wallet of your choice.  The coins should now be split, and you can verify this using BTC and BCH block explorers online if you would like.
2.  Install Virtual Box with a guest operating system like Ubuntu.  You can delete this guest operating system at the end if you want to.
3.  Install the Electron Cash wallet ( inside the guest operating system.  Electron Cash is not endorsed by Electrum and is maintained by an anonymous developer.  Installing it in a guest operating system should protect us from any potential malicious activity by the Electron Cash wallet.  Alternatively you could install the Electron Cash wallet on a bootable USB drive, or another computer entirely -- one which does not contain any sensitive information and can be wiped after you're finished.
4.  Using the Electron Cash wallet, import the private keys or seed for the address where the BCH are still stored.
5.  Send the BCH to an exchange (e.g. Kraken) from the Electron Cash wallet.
6.  Exchange your BCH for BTC, USD, etc.

"sometimes less than 10" and also sometimes more than 10.  That's why they say 10 minute *average* and not *sometimes*.
Also, wouldn't a smaller interval period imply the need for an even smaller block size?  Otherwise you would be increasing network costs and therefore also the likelihood that additional nodes would drop out.

I agree with you, eventually a hard fork will be needed.  But not a measly one-time 2X fork.  That's not a solution to the problem, it's kicking the can down the road and slicing your foot on the edge.


If it was needed, we would have already maxed out the capacity introduced by Segwit.  The reason we haven't is because some businesses want to offload the cost on to the network so that they don't have to upgrade their own software.
Perhaps we should instead be supporting research for real scaling solutions such as [MAST and Schnorr Signatures]( instead of trying to jam a one-time 2X hard fork down everyone's throats.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:02:08
Segwit was a compromise that increases the block size above 1 MB whilst avoiding a hard fork.  The 2X part is just a hard fork for the sake of hard forking.  We haven't even come close to exhausting the capacity introduced by Segwit yet and they're demanding an immediate 2X hard fork.  Why?

The blocks listed in the image posted by the OP were mined by the Bitcoin.com mining pool.  Bitcoin.com is owned by an individual, Roger Ver, who in recent years has become increasingly vocal about pushing a hard fork to increase the block size.  Whether bitcoin should or should not hard fork to a larger block size has been a raging debate between essentially two sides (there's actually many sides but it's easier to just argue against one other side when you have to argue), those who want to keep the block size small and keep the technical costs of the network low to maintain it's decentralized nature -- "small-blockers", and those who want to increase the block size such that there will always be sufficient space for all transactions and transaction fees will be low -- "big-blockers".  Roger Ver belongs to the latter side.
The OP is ironically calling Roger Ver a "small-blocker" because his mining pool has been mining blocks well below the allowed maximum block size despite him being very outspoken against limiting the block size.
Some may also notice a nuanced political jab in the OP that suggests Roger Ver may be intentionally limiting the blocks his pool mines with the intention of allowing the mempool to grow and fees to increase in an effort to further his political agenda. -- Or was that just me?

It prevents the mining hash power from forcing others to use any new rules the may choose to introduce.  For example, if the mining hash power decided to increase their income by raising the 21 million coin limit and the block reward.  They could easily do that with a few changes to the code and backing it with their hash power.  But by running a full node of your own, you can reject that change and sync with hash power that follows rules in agreement to your own.

This explorer is not bad:
note the size of the block I linked to is 1.3 MB.  The idea that Segwit does not increase the block size beyond 1 MB is simply misinformation.  The reason this misinformation has become so widespread is because there used to be a MAX_BLOCK_SIZE variable that was set to 1 MB, but it has since been replaced with a MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT (see the source code [here](  Some continue to argue semantics that it is not a block size increase because it has been replaced by a block weight.  But if you were to measure the size of these blocks in bytes, they can indeed go beyond 1 MB.
How far beyond 1 MB depends on the transactions included in the block, as some transactions have larger associated witness data than others.  But witness data is included in both pre-Segwit and Segwit blocks.  Segwit simply ~~rearranges where the witness data is located in the block~~ omits the signature data from the txid calculation.

I second this, OP.  Your professor might think bitcoin is a tulip bubble but that might be because he doesn't quite understand it yet or because he has a different perception of what makes something valuable.  I don't think either is particularly wrong, and someone shouldn't be demonized for being a skeptic.  Many of us were skeptical about bitcoin at some point as well, and the fast rising price doesn't help to differentiate it from pyramid schemes and other get-rich-quick scams.
Understand that your professor is likely trying to protect his students from falling for such scams, and that is okay.  But hopefully he will keep an open mind to your arguments, while providing some great counter arguments as well.  Please do not make the rapid rise in price your argument for bitcoin, that would only come off as arrogance.  Provide real arguments for the service bitcoin can provide to the world in remittance markets, protecting people from failing monetary policies, etc.
Again, praising the rapid price rise will do little to differentiate bitcoin from other real scams, and only do more to support the notion that it is just another tulip bubble.  Good luck to you, good sir!

So how does the price rise make it more expensive to flood the blockchain?  If anything it's cheaper now if cost to flood is denominated in BTC.

It's that BTC is decentralized (compare node counts) and can remain decentralized while scaling (LN, etc.).

The block size debate is a red herring.  BCH was forked to preserve compatibility with Bitmain's patented covert ASICBoost mining advantage.  SegWit breaks this advantage so they forked BCH to keep it going.  Because Bitmain has a patent on covert ASICBoost, no other miners can use it without the risk of being sued by Bitmain, and only further enforcing Bitmain's monopoly over the mining market and control over the bitcoin network.

Tracking each individual satoshi would be *very* costly.  Instead, we can just track them as quantities, e.g.:
X bitcoins were sent from Alice to Bob with a remainder of Y bitcoins in Alice's wallet.
But as you could probably imagine, the more coins are split into different addresses, the more balances we have to keep track of!  For example, if Alice splits her balance of 1.0 BTC into ten balances of 0.1 BTC we would now have ten times as many balances to track.  This is actually a very annoying problem known as bloating the **U**nspent **TX**n **O**utput set.  An attacker can exploit this problem by splitting their bitcoin balance into many tiny balances, dramatically increasing the memory required to store the UTXO set.  [And it's been done before.](  Unfortunately, simply increasing the blocksize only makes this attack more effective as you can split your balances quicker and cheaper.


We need to get as much of the community in agreement as possible to avoid a "chain-split".  And while getting everyone to agree on a solution is difficult and cumbersome, it is also one of Bitcoin's greatest strengths.  There isn't just a few guys calling all the shots for everyone.  Nobody can just change the rules to their advantage with a simple snap of their fingers.  The *majority* of the community must come to an agreement on changes to the rules.


There are many people who play a role in the decision making, including the community of users and businesses, the developers, and the miners.  The developers can create solutions, but they can't force the miners to activate them.  The miners ultimately must activate changes to the protocol, but if they activate something unfavorable to the community (like increasing the 21 million coin limit), the community can "fire" them by changing the PoW algorithm with help from developers.  But really, everyone wins as long as we work together with aligned interests.

Although I understand what you are saying (a 1 MB block added to a 10 MB blockchain is an increase of 10%, but a 1 MB block added to a 100 MB blockchain is just 1%), I think nullc is right.
The *actual growth* would be linear because it grows by the same amount each block, i.e. ~1 MB or what have you.  If you were to plot the size of the blockchain in MB over a time axis, you would have a linear plot, hence growth is linear.
**Edit:** Of course, if you look at a plot of the blockchain size up to this point it might appear exponential, because up to this point growth has not been bottle-necked by block cap, but by adoption rate.

I agree, especially when we should all be working together.  I believe some are too emotionally invested now to reconcile the community.

Increasing the block size also seems like a really simple solution, and pretty much everyone can understand the advantages ("lower fees, good!").  But the disadvantages of increasing the block size requires a little more thought about what actually makes Bitcoin valuable and different from other methods of payment.

Yea, even for a computer scientist or engineer I think it's a little dense.  Perhaps [this article]( is a *little* easier to follow?  I guess I haven't really seen any simple ELI5 analogies for SegWit.  There was [this]( but I don't really think it's that accurate.

To preserve Bitmain's patented covert ASICBoost mining advantage.  SegWit breaks ASICBoost so they forked a coin (BCH) that retains this unfair advantage.  Note that it is unfair because if any miner other than Bitmain uses it they could be sued by Bitmain, which would further enforce their mining monopoly and control over the bitcoin network.

Pretty much, yea.  The blockchain is the history of all bitcoins moving from wallet to wallet.


Yes, we need "off-chain" scaling (Lightning Network, Sidechains, etc.) and "on-chain" scaling (block size increase).  Neither will be sufficient alone.  And I don't think there are many arguing against that.  The heated debates are mostly regarding *how* and *when* we should implement these scaling solutions.
@_date: 2017-05-08 01:00:44
I could be mistaken but I don't think you have to be a multi-million dollar 50% attacker to double-spend.  Just send a second transaction spending the money to yourself with a higher fee than the transaction that was sent to the small business.  Or maybe use the ViaBTC transaction accelerator.
@_date: 2017-05-14 04:40:19
I've read similar comments in the other subreddit when someone doesn't want to get downvoted to hell for criticizing BU testing procedure, dispute a nonsensical twitter comment, etc.  And I wouldn't say OP proclaimed his loyalty.  He just wants to make a suggestion detached from the scaling debate.
@_date: 2017-05-04 01:17:12
I agree with you.  It might be nice to include some other items from the [wishlist]( in addition to a dynamic block size increase.  But, with all the complaining about SegWit putting too much into one package, the wishlist seems unlikely to happen.

Are there any safe exchanges to sell BCC?  I was thinking about liquidating slowly over time and getting a decent average.  Who knows,  maybe a wealthy investor comes along and corners a cheap BCC market for a quick pump and dump.

Now that [Litecoin is activating Segwit]( and so are many other coins, we'll get to see SegWit implemented on live coins with transactions carrying real value.  I think these coins can demonstrate the advantages of SegWit and encourage more push for Bitcoin to adopt it too.  I'm hopeful, but I also realize there are no guarantees.  Who knows, maybe something even better will emerge if it isn't adopted.

It is possible to perform a hard fork of the blockchain while maintaining the same repository.  A hard fork to increase the block size is actually in Core's roadmap according to this article: 
From what I've gathered, there are several reasons Core doesn't want to implement a hard fork to increase the block size immediately:
* The block size isn't an urgent issue as fees have remained tolerably low: 
* A one-time hard fork to larger blocks doesn't solve the longterm scalability issue.  Instead, a dynamic block size may be preferable, but this will require extensive testing and evaluation.
* A one-time hard fork to larger blocks is not as simple as a change to a single line of code as there may be some vulnerabilities exposed, specifically regarding transaction processing.
* If there are plausible options to increase transaction capacity via soft forks (widely regarded safer than hard forks), then these options should be considered first.
The choice to pursue soft fork solutions before hard fork solutions is unrelated to git repository access rights.
@_date: 2017-05-03 17:01:24
Your first paragraph describes my transition as well, originally favoring immediate on-chain scaling before an imminent rise in fees that would cause a "death spiral", as some put it.  
But, after understanding the arguments put forth by Core supporters, and after realizing the imminent danger of a death-spiral was greatly exaggerated, I've mostly leaned towards agreeing with Core.  
However,  I do believe a hard fork to increase the block size is inevitable once we've exhausted all other options.   I'm guessing most would agree with that statement though.  But I would prefer to just do one HF to a long-term solution,  not a series of HFs.
FWIW, I agree with pretty much everything else you said too.

Yes, the blockchain is basically a complete history of all transactions (unless you prune it!).  Once all bitcoins have been mined, miners will continue to make more blocks, but instead of being paid with a "block reward", they'll be paid with the transaction fees attached to users' transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-07 04:00:03
To most users, yea, storing the entire blockchain is pretty useless.  But it is extremely useful for verifying the integrity of the blockchain and making sure nobody has spent more bitcoins than what actually exists.  Each bitcoin can be traced back to a block created by a miner.  If it doesn't, then it's ignored by the network.  This way a clever hacker can't just create a bunch of fake bitcoins to spend.
Transaction fees may continue to rise if demand for transactions continues to outpace available block space.  But many solutions have been proposed to help mitigate this issue of increasing fees for the user.  One solution is to simply increase the blocksize and allow more transactions to be accepted in each block.  There's pretty wide agreement that this will eventually need to be done, but doing so also increases the costs to download, store, and validate the blockchain.  And as you pointed out, it does seem kind of useless to record *every* transaction.
Perhaps it would be better instead to conduct the majority of transactions "off-chain", and just periodically update the blockchain with a couple of anchoring transactions.  This, in very brief terms, is essentially what the [Lightning Network]( does.  The LN would run as a second layer on top of the bitcoin blockchain, conducting many, many transactions per second, and then settling the net results of those transactions on the blockchain with just a couple of anchoring transactions.  But before LN can be implemented securely, a fix for [transaction malleability]( must be implemented.  SegWit is praised by many because it fixes txn malleability while also modestly increasing the number of transactions that can be included in each block.
Of course, there are also detractors of SegWit who believe it is too complicated and we should simply just increase the blocksize.
Sorry to hit you with this wall of text out of nowhere.

*Tests* as in *unit tests*.  Unit test code doesn't actually run in normal functions of the software.  They're just used during development to find bugs and check for regression.  It's just good software development.  And yes, unit tests can require a lot of code to ensure that all those little mechanisms in your software are working properly.

Fees aren't bad right now and LN is heavily underutilized.  That being said, I would support something like a 5% annual increase for some years.  It's not really necessary though.
Like others are saying, if you increase the block size, the excess space will just fill up with transactions that really don't need to be on-chain forever and ever (remember satoshi dice?).  Also block size can be gamed by the miners, and it costs them nothing to fill the blocks.
@_date: 2019-05-03 16:44:13
I didn't say it could do everything.  I just said that alts are much better for pump-and-dump schemes.
I agree with you, some altcoins fill use-cases that bitcoin can't currently fill.  For example bitcoin would make for a terrible stablecoin.  Although, as recent news has shown, some stablecoins may not make for very good stablecoins as well.

At $0.29 the total market cap of BCC (including coins that haven't been issued yet) would be only ~$6 million.  The liquidity on exchanges would be even less.  One, *just one*, moderately not-even-that-wealthy individual could single-handedly pump the price of BCC.
Seems like it would be wiser to just hang on to them at that price rather than sell them.  Even if you owned 100,000 BCC, you would only make $29,000 at that price -- pocket change relative to your $290,000,000 in BTC.  Not even worth moving the BCC to a shady exchange to sell them.  I'm not a fan of BCC, but $0.29 is far too low a valuation.
I assume you were probably exaggerating with $0.29.
**Edit:** Although, I wasn't considering a majority hash power attack on BCC, in which case $0.29 would be far too high.

I don't think I've ever paid transaction fees over a dollar, but I understand fees got pretty crazy last December.  I would just create a cold wallet and then create the transaction with a small fee (5-10 sat/byte maybe?).  The miners will pick it up when the mempool low.
Here's a good site to help you estimate the fee:

Just write the private keys down with pen and paper and lock them away somewhere safe.  Triple check the key after you've written it down!

Don't wait until the 3rd to secure your coins!  Just move them to an offline wallet whenever transaction fees are low.  If everyone tries to move them all at once there's just going to be a bunch of butthurt when everyone is trying to push their transactions through at the same time and fees start to rise.

If we have a 1 kg gold brick and cut it in half, does it increase or decrease the amount of gold we have?  What if we cut that gold brick into 100,000,000 pieces?  We would still have the same amount of gold, i.e. no new gold is created or destroyed.  The same applies to bitcoin.  If you split your 1 bitcoin into 100,000,000 pieces, you would still have 1 bitcoin and you would not be able to buy any more or any fewer lambos (ignoring transaction fees of course).
TLDR: Divisibility != scarcity.

Bcash is more secure than bitcoin?  Maybe you should check again...
Unfortunately it only gets worse for bcash when the next halvening occurs.  They have hardly any fees to pay miners for securing the chain and they're about to halve the reward... and they're on schedule to halve before bitcoin since the chain was basically speed-mined thanks to the DAA.  Hopefully nobody (BSV miners?) attacks the bcash chain during that period.
Funny though, security is not something I've seen bcashers advertise as an advantage over BTC.
