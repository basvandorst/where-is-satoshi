Um wernt you the butthurt bitcoiner posting about how shit darkcoin is an it's just a pump an dump like yesterday? Smh so much trolling now the turn around thank you for spreading the word about our coin on front page of r//bitcoin...unless thy was your actual stategy then thank you sincerely cause it definetly worked

An there's always a bitcoiners who says what you just said what has any other coin done what bitcoin has done nothing beside offer faster transaction times or more volume of coin I say get over your self dark coin has offered something that btc doesn't an don't feel untouchable see MySpace/Facebook you should always take your competition seriously no matter how seemingly stupid look at dogecoin if that was done properly an started to rise(obviously to many coins) I believe it would explode

you do realise its not investing you clown its called speculating there is a clear difference, if you think your investing in bitcoin you are mistaken an im not sure if you realise but the coin is called darkcoin not bitcoin why do you think we want your spot? why do you all think we want people to be buying the newspaper an coffee with DRK?
@_date: 2014-06-03 12:50:19
oh man thank you i seriously just said the exact same thing over in the DRKcoin forums why the hate i use 3 DOGE,BTC an now DRK 
@_date: 2014-06-03 11:00:52
But ATM you are right bitcoin is god I love bitcoin but love darkcoin aswell hoping it can keep moving forward 
@_date: 2014-06-03 11:59:18
thanks for the heads up but yea not gonna waste my time going through post over the last couple of months in different forums
@_date: 2014-06-01 07:51:37
first an formost its definetly not investing its speculating..There is a difference i often think how many times i see "i just invested in this coin" etc i wonder how many ppl have been burned..lastly dont buy on hype do your own DD learn the ins an out the scams which there are alot then get a wallet an start buying lastly DO NOT STORE ON A EXCHANGE OR WITH 3RD PARTY!! enjoys its a wild ride an a good subject to learn about 
@_date: 2014-06-03 11:48:49
i dont know how to link i havnt been using reddit for that long an dont really care to learn 
@_date: 2014-06-04 21:05:19
My comment is unreadable? you illiterate fuck you replied to half of it,where's your logic clearly mad kid..again you must be so rich from "investing in bitcoin" you don't have to work now an just sit on reddit trolling because you don't have to work a regular job what a clown
@_date: 2014-06-03 12:12:42
head over to doegcoin an go through the posts there so so so many bitcoiner come over "nice joke coin this nice joke coin that blah blah blah" in my head im like right so you guys have made so much money off bitcoin you can now not work a job an spend your time trolling other pages talking down bout other coins?yep i guess their millionaires even on bitcoin forum when someone would blast a "shibe" for saying someting dumb in their forum i seen a few early adapter say things like "ignore thes guys they probably bought in at $1100 an are angry" im not aiming this at you im just over ppl carrying on for know reason get a life if you have made so much money with your god coin an just so you know i use BTC,DOGE an now DRK i aint no hater haha&lt;&lt;&lt;cool story bro 
@_date: 2014-06-03 12:53:13
oh my god i just used the myspace facebook arguement i love the DRK community even more completely 100% agree with you and yea i also hold BTC aswell as DRK
@_date: 2014-06-03 10:56:54
What makes you think we want big business to adapt darkcoin? Or for it to comply with laws? Maybe that's the whole point ? That's how bitcoin started now all it is is a usable share in a company that u can buy good an services for 
@_date: 2014-06-03 11:54:52
again your missing the point think we wanna be bitcoin i certainly dont i already have bitcoin why would i want something i already have or could easily get more of seems like your threatened....waits for stupid retort about pump an dump an corporate business 
@_date: 2014-06-03 12:20:32
so many feels haha nar all good im all about mature discussion just seems to be waves of ppl who wanna put down other coins with out realise what they are about an yea i get what your saying about the whole pitchfork thing all im saying is anything can always be improved if your not moving forward your moving backwards is DRK better than BTC?? mmn probably not but its definetly something that could be a real threat if implemented properly just like any business really but i dont see DRK being as wide spread as BTC highly unlikely ppl will use it to buy coffee haha but then again im dont think it was intented to be..good damn i love crypto its mad me understand thing i never did before alot more techy,have alot of discussions with ppl who are interested in other shit than just workin 9-5 an its even starting to make me anti establishment crypto haha the greatest tax evasion invention ever
