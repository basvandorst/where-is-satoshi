Why 99% and not 98% ? Or 42% ? Or 76% ? Random subjective numbers are not a Good Thing in finance.

Remember: graphs describe the past and do not predict the future.

No, it is a misconception: you see what has been trending but not what will be trending tomorrow. You cannot "extend the line just a little bit".

I (in France) use [Bitmarket.eu]( The verification process (which is not very strong) is painless, but most important the market is stable and the traders friendly.

Oh yes, it does… it does create a lot of trouble. Confusion in monetary systems are bad. As much bad as using imperial units in building space rockets: things tend to crash :)
Imagine how would be your life if the rest of the world decided to use another distance for the kilometre? Or if other countries were having 58 minutes in an hour and you 60? That would be a mess, because for every use people would have to specify which definition they are using.
So, why not an official alternate flourish representation for the mɃ; but abusing current existing standards is Bad.

I like this idea.
But - as a reminder - "฿" is the currency symbol for the Baht (`U+0E3F THAI CURRENCY SYMBOL BAHT`) so it MUST NOT be use for bitcoin.
[Please use instead "Ƀ" \(`U+0243 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER B WITH STROKE`\)](
