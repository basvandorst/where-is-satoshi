Definitely not being sarcastic.  I agree OR is very scenic and beautiful but not a desirable place to live by any means.  The people are literally dumb as bricks and it rains 9+ months out of the year... Not to mention the lack of diversity, I there’s nothing but white people here (and I’m white, but the lack of culture is boring as FUCK)
I grew up in NY, lived most of my life in CA, and I’ve been in OR for just over 4 years... Can’t wait to move out of this godforsaken state.

I’d suggest it.  I have some work I need to finish up here then moving back to Cali with my wife.  We both really don’t like Oregon.

Keep it coming dude I know this is therapeutic for you.

I think it’s that in combination with one of the worst education systems in the country.  My nephew is in 2nd grade and they’re just now learning to read.

No shit!  I moved here 4 years ago people are dumb as bricks.  Moving back to California soon.

U might be right!  Either way, Oregon people are stupid across the board... Transplant or not.  Some of the dullest humans I’ve ever met.

I understand your sentiments but I’m more so into California for the sunshine.
