You can also just get the cashapp debit card which you can purchase anything from the fiat in your cashapp. Just sell whatever you need and immediately you can buy whatever with your debit card. Super easy!

@_date: 2019-07-29 20:59:08
That's what I'm thinking. Guy is smart and not wasting money on a new car. Hes got time preference in mind.
@_date: 2019-07-21 23:30:09
5000 satoshi stimulus!
@_date: 2019-11-25 02:56:14
The app spazzed out. My bad haha
@_date: 2019-11-22 17:32:54
My TA says -$14k at least. The ghost of bear market past is creeping in.
@_date: 2019-11-22 17:28:42
Beautiful sir, beautiful.
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:11:51
The sell when it crashes
@_date: 2019-08-03 23:12:40
Watching this on my TV as I scroll past this lol
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:14:48
Then* lol
@_date: 2019-08-03 23:10:11
Me too lol at a loss. Totally worth it. It went down another 30% compared to bitcoin since then. Best loss I ever took haha
@_date: 2019-08-25 22:13:21
So you're talking about my ex...?

I got downvoted for a comment on the other fathers day post. I dont think people are really putting the future generations into perspective. These kids will all be voting age in a decade or so. We need them on the decentralized side of things!
@_date: 2019-06-17 00:43:32
Parenting done right! Love this.
@_date: 2019-10-31 03:07:11
@_date: 2019-06-17 00:34:55
You obviously didn't read line 7... this has everything to do with bitcoin. His daughter is our future and already talking about BTC. Hes doing bitcoin and parenting correctly!
@_date: 2019-06-05 00:38:08
Yessir. Just finished this book and thought the same thing!
@_date: 2019-06-16 19:24:58
Get a new credit card with 0 APR for the first 15 months. That'll at least help you not go soooooo fuckong rekt ....lol still not advisable tho haha
@_date: 2019-06-05 22:30:35

Good job dad!

Love this. These are the questions we all need to be asking!!
@_date: 2019-12-06 19:06:48
@_date: 2019-12-06 18:59:24
Game on. Looks like I'm gonna have to change my buy order to $0.003 ����
@_date: 2019-12-30 20:12:00
For real. I got a buddy who's been into bitcoin since 2016 and I brought up the halving to him and he didnt even know what it was. Theres hodlers that dont even know of the economics on BTC lol
@_date: 2019-12-06 19:03:26
Zero means no value. Pretty sure if something is $0.001 and I got 100 of em I can trade that for one of your special pennies. Oh and I'm pretty sure there are several currencies where the smallest denomination is worth less than $0.01.
@_date: 2019-12-06 19:05:31
Then I'll be the only miner after the difficulty adjustment! Yay for centralization!
@_date: 2019-12-06 21:29:08
That's why I said I'd buy every coin in circulation. Doubt I'm getting Satoshis 1m BTC or the other several million lost coins. But I could definitely buy all the rest lol
@_date: 2019-12-29 17:56:56
@_date: 2019-12-28 17:37:59
Actually you can transfer from coinbase to Coinbase Pro instantly for free. Then withdrawal from Pro for free. 0 sats. And usually confirmed on the blockchain within the next block or 2!
@_date: 2019-12-30 20:02:08
But...but...that well-spoken guy on youtube bitcoin will be 100k by summertime. He also said charts never lie. So the jokes on you bud, cuz I got a second mortgage on my house and invested all in BTC. I'm gonna be rich!! �������� 
@_date: 2019-12-06 19:38:55
Continue to live my life just as poor as I am now LOL
@_date: 2019-12-06 21:34:30
I bet I could find one person on the interwebs somewhere to buy 10 of them for $0.01, making them worth something.
@_date: 2019-12-24 17:58:15
Look into getting the book The Bitcoin Standard by saifedean ammous. You can technically get the audiobook for free by signing up for Audible and then canceling your subscription, keeping the free audiobook.
@_date: 2019-12-28 15:49:03
Unless you buy on robinhood
@_date: 2019-06-05 22:25:36
@_date: 2019-12-30 20:08:04
You gotta take into account, that given theres no worldwide epidemic killing billions, there will be around 14 billion people by 2050. Making even less BTC per person globally. Also the last million BTC will take decades to mine completely.
@_date: 2019-12-06 18:33:27
It literally cant go to 0. I'll buy all in circulation at $0.0001 . Then I'll be the only whale!!!
@_date: 2019-12-30 20:32:14
Ahh ok. I heard a few different estimates. But still, even just 10 billion is a 20%+ in current population.
@_date: 2019-04-23 02:07:26
Gasoline only has a 90 day shelf life. Your money would still end up worthless. Good luck selling 400,000 gallons of gas within the first 90 days of the economy collapsing...lol
@_date: 2019-12-28 17:24:02
They werent "free". They cost time and energy to hunt or harvest.
@_date: 2019-04-15 14:50:00
Will this affect BTC price ya think?
@_date: 2019-12-28 18:13:56
If you dont think time and energy are worth something, then debating with you is pointless. I couldn't care less about your opinion. Have a good day sir.
@_date: 2019-12-06 18:57:54
If I buy at $0.00000001, that ain't zero bud.
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:14:32
Well when SV launched the price of bitcoin dropped significantly.
@_date: 2019-04-23 03:45:27
From google.
Though it naturally degrades and loses combustibility over time due to oxidation (exposure to oxygen) and evaporation of its volatile compounds, gasoline usually lasts three to six months when properly stored in a labeled, tightly sealed plastic container or metal tank
@_date: 2019-04-22 05:42:40
He has raisins*
@_date: 2019-09-08 15:20:19
Though you lost your bitcoin forever, you did a great service to the rest of us hodlers. I just got 1/21000000 richer! Thank you for your service...
@_date: 2019-09-08 16:01:20
Calm your tits sir, its obviously a trolling post.
@_date: 2019-09-08 15:44:18
They got "hacked" though... :-P
@_date: 2019-09-03 18:30:08
In in the US. I'd love a free copy of mastering Monero!
@_date: 2019-09-08 15:41:16
Wouldn't become catholic if you paid me 100BTC.
@_date: 2019-09-08 15:36:27
Never said I wouldn't apologize...
@_date: 2019-05-27 21:15:52
Yeah I just broke even from FOMOing in 2017....lol but hodling and dollar cost average and I'm good now! On we go..
@_date: 2019-05-13 01:03:31
Just give it to me. I'll give it back in a year... I promise!
@_date: 2019-05-27 22:07:11
All lessons learned though!
@_date: 2019-05-27 22:16:08
Yes buy The Bitcoin Standard and read it! Hell, read it twice! If you're low on funds you can sign up for a monthly sub to Audible and you get a free book. As long as you cancel your sub before the month is up then you got the book for free!
@_date: 2019-05-21 00:19:58
ETF Decision. 
Will it be approved? Will it be delayed? 
Find out next time on Dragon Ball Z!!!
@_date: 2019-05-21 00:09:44
Yes litecoin and monero
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:00:21
That's only with your USD. That insurance does not count for your crypto if it gets stolen.
@_date: 2019-05-21 00:28:38
If you only have 0.0125 BTC then that's not much of a loss....lol still a loss tho. If you have coinbase then coinbase Pro has zero fees for withdrawals. Youd have to pay a fee to send it back to an exchange in the future tho
@_date: 2019-05-27 22:06:28
Honestly like an idiot but not because of 60 %losses. But because I had a good chunk of fiat waiting for it to go to 1800. Didnt buy enough at 3k! Could have broken even like 2k ago lol
@_date: 2019-05-21 00:10:54
And technically as of now, the BTC price affects all the alt coins in one way or another...
@_date: 2019-05-21 00:25:55
Thank you!
