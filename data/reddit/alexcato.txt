More full nodes. Isn't that actually what we want to see to increase decentralization?
Especially this bit is great and helps a lot:

The only thing remotely relevant to cryptocurrencies from the article:


I see no "encouragement" for Bitcoin anywhere.

You could be right.
But as in everything else, there's always a chance that you could be biased.
In this case: maybe you dont see smart people supporting BU, because you automatically label anyone as "not smart" who does lean towards them? A little bit like "all [core/BU] devs support X", while all that didnt support X have left.

How does the existence of an ETF affect your ability to hold your own bitcoin (with private keys)?

The value is not what the BU token would be worth, this instrument is set up in a more complex way.
The value of the BCU-Tokens is (or should be):
    P(a hardfork happens in 2017) * Expected_Value_of_a_BU_Bitcoin
P = probability.
The value of these BCU tokens will increase significantly with the probability of a hardfork actually happening.

There's no potential upside for a company to pick a side, but big potential downsides. So I can't see an incentive to disclose their opinion.
Whichever side they pick, they can be sure that the "other" side of this "debate" will attack them. , Coinbase and others can serve as an example here.
Simply not picking a side is, from a business perspective, the best move.
@_date: 2017-03-30 21:08:11


Of course they can. It's just not smart. Publishing how they'd handle a fork is something different than picking a side.


Relevance to the question whether it's good from a business perspective to pick a side publicly?

Thank you!

There's already a risk-free alternative, in which the funds to be tumbled cannot be stolen by the mixer:  &amp; For amounts bigger than about 0.5btc, this also will be considerably cheaper than the mixers you suggest (due to high-ish bitcoin transaction fees on the bitcoin network). Big amounts can easily be tumbled for &lt;0.5% in total fees.
Downside: mostly command-line so far, so it's not super-easy to use yet.

I agree that there probably is no ill intent.
But as you see, people are using lines from the transcript, without actually checking the audio for whether the transcript is correct. And that way, more wrong "quotes" are created, feelings hurt, bitcoiners misinformed.

You can still test it with 0.05 bitcoin, if you like. But miner fees will eat up a bigger chunk of that (relatively) than of, for example, 5 btc.

What would organic growth in a movement have looked like from the outside?
@_date: 2016-12-15 10:58:38


Agreed. But only cons of BU are allowed to be discussed here, which would create a pretty one-sided 'discussion'. Posts containing pros will be removed (community guideline  on the right side bar)
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:46:54
Of course not. But the hashrate doesnt matter before November. If they mine BCH instead of S2X after the planned hardfork, that's a clear violation. But at this point it is not.
@_date: 2016-12-15 11:11:19
Please listen to the actual audio. Your quote is not what was actually said.
He never made a point about personally not being listened to. It was all about the bitcoin business community (as a whole) being completely ignored. The example he gave in the conversation was mostly from the satoshi round table discussions, where most of the important bitcoin business leaders and many core developers were present.

This is a link to a centralized, custodial mixer which can:
* steal your funds and
* charges very high fees (if it doesnt steal).
Use non-custodial mixing instead, which cannot steal anything from you *and* also charges a lot smaller fees:
* Wasabi wallet for smaller amounts (in 0.1 BTC increments) [Wasabi-Link]( or
* Joinmarket for bigger amounts: [Joinmarket-Link](
@_date: 2016-12-17 10:06:59
Edit: i must have missed the screenshot when i first read the post. It clearly states that the deposit TX has been published to the blockchain. The seller probably just used to low transaction fee.
Or he just did not send the transaction yet. Doesnt even have to be a blockchain-related problem.
I've had someone do the same thing: accepting an offer, then it took him/her 4 days to actually pay. Wonder if some do it on purpose to lock in the current BTC price and only continue on later if the price moves in their favorable direction.
@_date: 2016-12-17 10:09:45
juxtapozz is right. First step is paying the BTC deposit before any money wiring needs to be done.

Or it might show how badly he wants this stalemate to move forward?
Sad, that you assume the worst potential interpretation.
@_date: 2019-01-08 12:53:37
Until Wasabi does the unequal amount mixing:
Joinmarket can solve this right now, without needning to do the Monero + exchange over tor. Easily up to currently &gt;30 BTC for fees which are likely well below 0.1% for a full tumbling run. Can be run 100% over TOR.

I agree with your first paragraph.
The quote though seems distorted. The article says exactly the opposite. Full context:

What I dont really get: even in the unlikely case (from current data) that there's 20% hashrate on the UASF segwit chain, that's gonna take many weeks for the difficulty adjustment. But there's a second effect:
During those weeks, new blocks will be found once every 50 minutes. That for several weeks? You think fees are bad now? Bitcoin's going to be dead by the time the transaction throughput normalizes if it's practically unsuable for that a long time.
The same reasoning works with higher hashrates as well. The "but miners will join that chain soon!" isnt really backed by any data as well.
What kind of data needs to be collected that could convince UASF supporters that they are not the economic majority that they assume they are?

You know, exchanges could at this very moment already be sending a very strong signal to the UASF movement?
