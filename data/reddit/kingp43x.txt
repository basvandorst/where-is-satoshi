Read a lot heh.  Reddit is good, but read everywhere.  Find some favorite you tubers and subscribe.  I like a channel called cryptodaily. Another good one that is new is the magical crypto friends channel.  That one is made by the developers of bitcoin, litecoin and monero.

all good questions.  Ask here, it's doomed.  ask "there" its about to save the world and everyone in it, AND everyone is going to be rich.... except people who hold bitcoin
I guess the way I rate coins is by their place in the coin market cap, right now BCH is 4th, which I guess is good. BTC has always been number one since, well... day one.
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:54:14
hundreds of thousands?  was there a ninja edit or something?
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:16:07

Ok. Keep dismissing the sketchy rollout.  Go ahead and dismiss the angry customers who see it for what it is.   Good on ya
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:25:56
I'm not sure if your comment is aimed directly at me or what.  I was just sharing my viewpoint.    I've removed myself from either side in this thing as much as I can.   I prefer BTC by a mile. Ver rubs me the wrong way, I despise what Ver and CO are doing with BCH,  and discussion in r/BTC seems to be mostly at the 9th grade level. 
 I knew I should have thrown a sarcasm tag on my last post.   Oh well,  live and learn. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:59:03
You don't think that r/bitcoin works on "the protocol" do you?  Most  of us here are just simply redditors and BTC investors.  We surprisingly have opinions and voice them.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:12:02
It means the value of bitcoin is going up, dramatically.
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:11:04
Sooo... I'm not sure I understand.  Should all forks of bitcoin just be called bitcoin?  That seems silly.  There would be like 7 bitcoins.  Or is it just ok if Roger does it?
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:11:56
should every fork simply be called bitcoin?  What are we at?  like 5 or 6 different bitcoins now?  Should all have the same name?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:22:39
I've long since deleted the email.  You sure about the "by".  I believe it was on or after.  But not sure.  Big distinction. Still rather shady how it went out.

Charlie no longer works at coinbase as far as I know.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:52:23
So you don't have to read my mind, I like coinbase.  I don't like BCH, I despise Ver.   I think coinbase did a shitty job of introducing BCH, and I understand why so many people are pissed at coinbase.
I really don't care what you think people "should" be doing.  I do find it funny that I'm defending coinbase to one redditor while trying to point out that they handled BCH terribly to another. Cest la vie haha.  I'd give myself about a 10% chance of getting that such is life thing correct
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:01:24
I dont get the comment I keep seeing on reddit of "the fees are becoming more than the amount bought or spent in many cases".  Why do people say this when it is blatantly false.   I've been buying BTC in  200 dollar chunks for the last few months (  on coinbase no less ).  Are you guys suggesting I'm losing money or something?  I'm paying 7 bucks each time.  Where are you getting these absurd  numbers?  Another commenter is sugesting the average transaction fee is 160 dollars. Where do you guys come up with these numbers?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:49:47
Yes, Coinbase is one of the easiest way if you can.  I'm in the US, not sure which countries it's available in.  I FOMO put another $100 in yesterday.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:45:54
It isn't really a rise as much as so many people getting into BTC and just hearing about him at a greater volume IMO.  He has always been the guy who people point newcomers to his speeches on you tube.  He flies around the world giving talks on bitcoin and is very good at explaining the whole idea to  newcomers.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:16:58
Yes it is fine
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:55:13
Oh no, not steam!  Look how much it's affected the price, up another 2 or 3 k
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:01:26
Small weekly buys work well.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:28:59
They rolled out that BCH just about perfectly, right?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:18:26
It's a beautiful thing.  I'm doing the same haha.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:46:42
Yep.  That's how I do it.  Coinbase offers bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum, so you can buy all three of those on coinbase.  My girlfriend and I are both putting weekly buys in.  well she's doing weekly and I'm doing bi-weekly since that's how we get paid.
Maybe try and put $50 a month if you can
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:17:45
Hmmm... weird that you change your argumemt.  Whatever.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:47:12
What ya mean?  These are legit.

luckily you're here to straighten everyone out without saying anything.  Congrats
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:44:15
Its not even close to late.  Many of us expect it to go to hundreds of thousands.  You should also know you can buy $50 worth if you like.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:25:39
Ummm... no one is concerned about storage options. How does that relate to their sketchy AF BCH rollout?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:21:51
lol I'm good, and you?  I hope your comment isn't suggesting that steam dropping BTC caused  $150 billion to be pulled out of all crypto.
Is BTC the only coin down at the moment?  J/k  we both know that isn't the case.  Every coin is down.  You were smelling a crash, did you have some shorts going?  If so, nice timing.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:30:04
Terrible rollout of BCH on their exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:49:50
Holy smokes, was it something I said?   Who pulled the 100 billion out of crypto?  lol.  Luckily I am holding some ripple too haha.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:09:52
bitcoin = no more garbage?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:54:09
Not in crypto.  I can scroll thru the top 100 and wouldn't be surprised if half of the coins have moved 15%
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:05:33
This is a comparison of bitcoin cash trying to take the name of bitcoin.  The sub r/btc has been droning on and on about bitcoin cash being the real bitcoin and they want it to be bitcoin.  If they just shut up and be bitcoin cash none of this would be a thing.
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:13:19
not worried, just think its funny.  bitcoin cash can be bitcoin cash, no problem.  that other sub needs to shut up about "we are the true bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:01:32
Not really.  Crypto currencies aren't nearly as ingrained into modern society the way fiat is

@_date: 2017-12-28 06:04:19
Not sure why you're so defensive lol.  I read multiple posts saying how incredibly high the fees were.  I chose yours to comment on and say that that has not been my experience.  You told me you saw some pictures......  You're giving off that Roger coin vibe from r/btc.
Relax and get you some ripple
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:04:12
So this is where much of this misinformation or FUD is coming from  eh?  You "keep seeing pictures"?   I am buying bitcoin from an exchange with notoriously high fees and I'm paying 7 dollars to buy $200 in BTC.    Keep spreading the word my friend.  Ignorance is bliss, it also works great to fit peoples narratives. Especially those out to try and topple bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:15:10
No.  It is not pointles.  I've bought $300 over the last week, it is now $460

@_date: 2017-12-24 21:03:36
I'm having trouble understanding this comment.  You are saying that you use coinbase because gdax takes to long to verify you?  Those two companies are one and the same.  If you're verified on coinbase aren't you verified on gdax?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:57:57
I'm just doing weekly buys, and plan on doing so thru this next year. Small amounts add up quickly.  And diversify into some alts as well.

@_date: 2017-02-10 00:24:27
Ya, honestly I don't know man.  I'm concerned about it also.  I barely understand myself.  I've put about 1k on my trezor in bitcoin and I worry about it often lol.  Theres alot of ways to fuck it up it seems.  Many folks will tell you to avoid keeping your money on an exchange, but it seems a great way to hold your coin if you don't have a fortune to lose.     I've held my 1k in bitcoin on coinbase until recently and have had no problems.  There was the infamous Mt. Gox event that cost alot of people there money.  They went under and just told everyone sorry but we lost your coin.  Now many people keep their coin on a hardware wallet, with like 10 forms of recovery backup.
Hope that helps, but its really the blind leading the blind here lol
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:29:29
I think the seed is the 24 word key that you link to your bitcoin.  I'm sure thats a terrible way to explain it.  I have 24 random words written down, if i lose my trezor or whatver, I can get my bitcoin by knowing those words.....
I'll stop now, I'm confusing myself lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:03:20
Well it doesn't seem to have affected  the LTC price very much. But whatever.

for example ETH is approx. .081 BTC at the moment
@_date: 2016-06-11 17:14:38
Yup, brand new.  Been paying attention for the last year or so, but just bought my first bits, heh.
Coinbase only letting me buy $60 a day right now, I'm trying to drop around $1k in the next week or so, hoping to 10x my money for the halvening or whatever its called lol.
I keeed, I keed.   I hope it does spurt upwards at that time, but I'll be happy to dump money into it regularly for the next 6 months or so and see how it goes.
@_date: 2017-01-05 03:33:37

I have never met a single person that hates bitcoin, or even dislikes it, so I'm not sure why you're suggesting that.

@_date: 2017-11-08 21:05:48
This helped me understand much better.
It's not the gospel, and r/btc will not like much of it, but it filled in many of the holes in my understanding of WTF is going on and why.

adding to what uacdeepfield commented - look at what BTC was worth a year ago.  Most of us expect the same gains or better over the next year.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:47:02
They made the decision of leaving their coins in someone elses control.  That someone else made a decision for them.  Were the BTC coin holders unable to take possession of their coins?
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:54:00
IMO not immediately.  Many people moved their money into BTC in hope of getting the forked coin.  Now that it isn't happening, people are moving their money back out.  I saw it at about $7600 or so about an hour ago, and since the news (about an hour ago) its down to $7300.  Understand that that is literally nothing in terms of BTC, but money can likely be moved out.  
Long term, I see it as a big move up in the coming months.  Look at that chart for BTC from last year until now, I expect that rise to continue.
But, remember, as most of us here, I am just some random internet dork watching cryptos.  opinions are like assholes and all that
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:56:17
no worries, we are still  WAAAAAYYY early in the game.  I plan to keep dumping a few hundred bucks a month in and watch it gain.  Look where BTC was this time last year.

Thanks for the input!  Any other advice on how I should properly utilize reddit?  
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:26:31
I'm not positive about how all of the different wallets work honestly.  But, YES, I believe you have it exactly right.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:55:42
Yup.  I agree with you.  I'm holding a little chunk of ETH waiting to move to BTC, but ETH is rising while BTC is falling.  I'll move in the next day or two, when the dust settles a little.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:35:16
Great post.  Thank you.  and congrats on learning to spell, you wiseoldram you
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:31:57
Not really.  I'm asking if you mostly hold the coin and expect it to go up.  or do you buy it and then spend it.  Everyone seems to want it to replace the dollar and spend it.  I buy to hold and hope it goes up in value.
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:51:57
seriously, holy fuck.  this could be massive.  14 million nerds.  How many of those do you think already know about bitcoin.  
It does matter how it's portrayed, but I can't see it being shown in a negative light.
14 million people could mean a ton of new buyers
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:19:50
You don't feel r/btc is just as bad?  
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:31:55
Serious question.  I'm assuming you prefer BCH, forgive me if I'm wrong.  
r/btc scolded me for months now for holding BTC and not using it for buying shit, tipping, buying coffee , whatever...  
With BCH increasing in value so much over the last few days, is it still the idea that you should be spending your BCH?  Especially while it's rising so much?
To me it would be the same thing as BTC, hold onto it and watch your value increase exponentially.  Again, not trying to start shit, just curious.  I will ask over on r/btc as well.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:18:12
Damn right.  While I admire the passion on some of these subs, it's gotten to be way too much.  r/btc has been killing me for expressing these same sentiments.  "Go read the white paper!"  "Watch this video from 2011!"  etc.
I'm in crypto to make money.  I'm a bit old for a retirement plan, and this is looking like a great way to increase my financial holdings apart from "traditional" investments.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:18:56

This is a good start.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:05:26
What ya mean?  It means those mining pools which were going to be split between btx or whatever the F it was and BCH will move back to BCH exclusively.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:06:57
No need to be sorry.  I can't imagine the magical internet money will even know of your plans or care.  As for the opinions of the bitcoin community, probably a collective &lt;shrug&gt;
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:44:10
I'm sure you're aware of BTCs performance over the last year, or hell, even the last month.   How terrible are those investments looking when you aren't looking at only the last week?
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:09:22
I'm glad I'm seeing this more and more lately.  They have done a pretty good job of sweeping this under the rug.

@_date: 2017-11-13 20:53:48
I believe they can still mine BTC, they just cannot take advantage of ASICBOOST.  Funny thing is how they were denying even using the ASICBOOST advantage while it could make them approx. $100 million extra per year.   Sure..... I believe that....
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:57:41

At the time BTC was 20k the total market cap for cryptos was approaching one trillion dollars.  Now it is under 500 billion.  Total market cap for all cryptos was cut in approx. half, every coin price suffered from their all time high in DEC.  I have a sneaking suspicion you are very well aware of this tho.... so there's that.
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:15:03
You are most definitely wrong here.  Sorry.
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:33:58
Yes they'll exist.  Coinbase is huge and easy to use.  I've liked coinbase very much up until yesterday when I read they'd be supporting 2x.  I hope they change that stance (well honestly I haven't seen it from coinbase directly )
Side note.  coinbase tricked me when they said they wouldnt give us bcash, so i moved my money back into ETH, missing out on bcash that I would have sold immediately, (but theyre not giving it up until next year, so it might be worthless by then anyways)
anyways thats been my only beef with coinbase up until I became informed yesterday with the whole must read for newcomers thing

I'm not him but I think it was hilarious how Roger was the one who posted it in r/btc.  The best part was that instead of commenting on the interview, his post only said that one of the shows producers said he liked Rogers shirt.
And then I found it hilarious seeing Rog get blasted by the callers which in turn blew AJ's mind. haha
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:59:36
do yourself a favor and watch it, its good.  Once it gets to the callers it gets even better

@_date: 2017-09-29 18:48:43
seriously, it's ugly
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:53:09
Ya.  So I got juked by coinbase.  I had bitcoin.  They said they will not pay off the bitcoin cash.  I moved my money out of bitcoin into ETH because of all this fork confusion.  They forked, and then coinbase said they'd pay the bitcoin cash. (not until Jan. 1st)
If I would have kept my bitcoin, I'd have gotten the bitcoin cash, which was valued at 600 or so, and now is like 450, who knows what itll be on Jan 1st.
Smart move would have been to have my bitcoin offline, and received my bitcoin cash by moving it into a wallet or whatever the procedure is, and then dump it or hold it, whichever you preferred.
So ideally (if you want a fork, I don't), youd have your bitcoin in a hardware wallet or whatever somewhere, wait for the fork and have 1 bitcoin + 1 bitcoin2x or whatever it is.  Then you can sell one or the other or keep both, whichever you prefer.
The forks worry my because I felt maybe my bitcoin would have dropped in value equal to the value of the new forked coin.  It's confusing as fuck and theres so many angles in play, I just keep my money out of bitcoin until these dorks figure this shit out.
I hope that bitcoin doesnt fork, everyone fucks off, and then I can buy back into bitcoin and watch it take off.
Read this - It helped me a ton.
opinions will certainly vary lol
How will it be determined if a fork will occur?  who the hell knows.  Just keep your eye on the storyline.  You have like a month to figure it out haha
@_date: 2017-10-03 01:15:40
From my understanding, the creation of bitcoin cash already kinda breaks the deal
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:28:38

@_date: 2017-09-29 17:17:03
which is the s2x thread?
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:38:01

@_date: 2017-10-03 01:51:37
What?  you said they will release a legitimate statement like they did with BCH.
They flip flopped hard on BCH.  I guess it's legit, until we catch heat and change our minds.
@_date: 2017-09-27 00:05:53
Wow.  Thank you.  I love new words. Those looked like gibberish, hah.
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:25:12
Ya, that's how they got me on BCH.  They said "We are not giving anyone BCH, fuck BCH"  (paraphrasing).  I got freaked out by all of the bull shit that was going on and moved all my money out of BTC.
OF COURSE, right after the split, everyone raged on them and then they said, oh.. ok... we'll give everyone BCH.... in January.
@_date: 2017-09-29 01:33:44
whatever that means.  throw a comma in there or somethin
@_date: 2017-09-30 02:34:27
lol ya, this one is supposedly sometime in November.  I don't think it'll actually happen, but they're calling each others bluff
I recommend this when you have 15 minutes or so
the guys over in r/btc don't like this, but it seems to explain a lot to me

They've probably been talking about this for 6 months.  They arent splitting from BCH.  Why arent they splitting from bitcoin classic?  Same reason.  Because they have nothing to do with what is being discussed.
@_date: 2017-10-03 01:00:04
You mean a legitimate statement like when they said they wont honor BCH, and then later changed that to they will honor it.... in January?
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:41:01

you spelled hold wrong and holding is the only way to go, you're a sucker if your spending your BTC
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:58:40
wow tyvm, I wish more people from r/btc would give responses like this instead of the "your stupid!, go back to r/bitcoin you shill"  stuff I normally see.  I'm heavily influenced by that post previously mentioned, but like many others I get a bit overwhelmed by how much I'm expected to know about all of this.
I'm mainly involved to make money from this stuff.

@_date: 2017-10-02 22:19:22
(not positive here)  I believe if you had your BTC in a wallet at the time of a split, technically you don't have the BCH until you "create" it by separating it from your BTC out of your wallet.  Not sure how to explain it, but it wont magically create it inside your wallet.  
I don't know about the leaving it in coinbase part.  I'd think if you sold it or moved it, you'd still get your BCH in January, but that's still some bullshit.
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:40:59
because nobody gives a damn about bcash, and Ethereum is doing its own thing.   The people involved in this battle were all bitcoiners at one time, now their pulling it around in a big game of tug of war trying to be the number one king of the hill

@_date: 2017-10-02 22:22:05
That's ok.  This (and any other rubbish I post ) is entirely my opinion.  
I just don't think this fork is going to happen, at least any time soon.  There's too much politics and uncertainty going on right now.  I guess we'll all know in a few weeks or months.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:20:08
Dont fall into the misconception that you have missed the bus on bitcoin.  Buy small amounts over time and only what you can afford to lose.  It is definitely not to late to invest.  We are still very early in this game.  You'll see predictions of prices all the way to 500k and higher.  I think we're still at like under 1% adoption.
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:10:49
pretty much any and all altcoins and exchanges use BTC to purchase the alts.
people take their BTC, buy some alts, when the alts go up (hopefully) they sell the alts back into bitcoin

@_date: 2017-10-25 03:45:25
I was certainly not impressed with how they handled the bitcoin cash fork.  At first they were saying they weren't going to support bitcoin cash at all, then, I want to say after the fork(?) or right before, thye said they'd support bitcoin cash, but not until January.  They're all over the place.
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:53:48
You'll get them, you'll just have to jump thru a couple hoops to do it.

currently there is no such thing.  If there is a hardfork next month it will come into existence.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:12:58
Ill sell you my 2016 expedition for 3 BTC.    105k miles on it
@_date: 2017-09-29 01:34:29
fucking read it if you actually give a shit, you lazy bastard
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:12:44
Them fuckers jammed me up with bitcoin cash...
anyways..  If you had your bitcoin on coinbase you will get your bitcoin cash... in January lol.  Who knows what it'll be worth by then.
If you had it in a wallet, you have to pull your bitcoin cash out to get it, then put it back in I guess.  Something like that

He goes right on to push users over to bitcoin.com after his correction, sounds fishy
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:19:51
Yup.  This also why a lot of people are continuously buying and expecting to hold for a good 5 to 10 years
@_date: 2017-09-30 02:35:30
pretty good, boss
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:14:04
most likely, heh
Ya, we'll see.
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:18:10
You and Roger should notify the authorities 
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:02:24
Hmm..    guesing your trying to say fork?  The coin splits into two seperate coins.  One usually gets sold off and put back into the other.  It hapened in august giving  people bitcoin cash 1 to  1.   Too much to go into here, but, ya, free money basica,ly
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:05:14
And up when you sell it, right?
@_date: 2018-04-08 02:52:07
1. Sorry, but I would never use or advise someone to use these.  The rates are stupid.
2. Proofread titles before hitting submit.  It's not difficult.  "The store down my house"......  And "withdrow"?  lol
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:05:28
I think there is something about transactions being batched together as well.  You can combine 10 transaction into one for example.
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:33:36
good call
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:54:08
lmao  The markup on these machines is horrendous.  You would be a fool to use one.
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:50:18
I'm hoping it's avoided.  I still think it can be.  But that's the thing for all of us on the sidelines.  We have to stay in wait and see mode for a bit
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:24:07
I feel "charlatan" is very appropriate for Roger specifically 
From Wikipedia -
A charlatan (also called swindler or mountebank) is a person practicing quackery or some similar confidence trick or deception in order to obtain money, fame or other advantages via some form of pretense or deception
@_date: 2017-05-05 08:40:36
WOOT!    I'm back!
@_date: 2017-05-05 08:17:04
Fuck, how am I gonna pay for that?
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:51:35
dun dun dunnnnnnn
@_date: 2017-05-04 22:08:15

@_date: 2017-05-05 03:25:41
75k is a hell of a down payment anyway....
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:23:17
or a nice down payment
@_date: 2017-07-19 22:56:59
Don't you get it?  Just like HODL, it's a stupid grammatical error, but so many find it hilarious.  It's not.  it's stupid.  Luckily he's making sure more people get behind the stupidity.
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:50:04
heh, topped out
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:12:24

@_date: 2017-05-04 00:34:32
I'm selling right now and buying A Milky Way
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:24:51

@_date: 2017-06-02 20:13:23
