You me and the rest of the community give bitcoin value, if people aren't willing to sell below a certain price then that is the price.
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:59:48
But what does that equate to in the new international currency of Doge!

Delta and blockfolio, prefer blockfolio interface but servers seem a bit of an issue sometimes

If an when the technical hurdles and ease of use are solved and mass adoption occurs I would expect between $100,000 and $1,000,000 per coin think we are still 5 - 10 years away

Don't invest anything you can't afford to lose. If price goes down hodl, if price goes up hodl,
HODL till the moon or we come crashing down.

Alts are on their way back up, hope you Hold'd
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:33:33
There's a long way to go up yet, just remember if everyone just hold'd it we would not be at this point now.

Maybe less. Or could be the same.

Tim is pretty damn good, He's on the left, i'm a bit more right leaning so his views don't align with mine, but he tries to be objective and researches which is what matters from a journalist.
