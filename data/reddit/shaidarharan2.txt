Look at all the comments about wishing they bought earlier in there when it hit 1000 lol. I wonder how many of them bought at 1000, or sat it out yet again for another 15x growth even after the correction.

I think I’m one of the few comforted by the correction. The rocket ship from 10k to 20k was a wild ride, but felt way too fast and unsustainable, hopefully it’s slower steadier growth from here. That it's still sitting at or above 10K is amazing enough, this seems like it's natural price for now, and *when* demand once again grows in excess of the rate of production, price will go up again.

I know we can't tell the future, but on your best guess, if I have a bunch in an exchange I've been putting off moving out due to the transaction fees, should I take advantage of this low, or is it expected to steadily go lower? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:08:54
Yeah, the comment sections on public articles about it are godawful. I think there's a lot of people bitter about not getting in with the string of ATHs, and are doubling down on hoping it bursts. 
The comments just do prove how niche it still is to the public, still a long way to grow!

Bought another batch during the dip. Went to transfer it out. 0.001btc network fee. 19 Canadian dollars! That's the highest I've ever seen it.

That wallet doesn't help if you're trying to transfer out of an exchange, right? Only if sending your own outwards? I don't see how you could set the fee an exchange chooses.

I do push for lightning network, but there's only so much I can do. It seems forever 18 months away, which may be beautiful in two or three years but it's painful right now. 
I could wait to spool up more before moving out of coinbase, I don't love doing that, but even the "regular" 4-7usd transfers are painful.

I mean, that's already happening with fiat, look at the States right now. The 99% shaking off the power of the 1% already isn't going so well, so why would this system in particular fail because the early adopters are particularly rich? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:25:40
Have you seen the backlog? The exchanges usually just have a simple average that decides the transaction fee, but that's so that the transaction doesn't get dropped out due to the huge mempool size and transaction backlog since the 6th. 
I plan on waiting it out. But that it got to 20-40 dollars in a time of high transactions is more than proof it needs to change, Lightning can't come fast enough. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:49:07


I loled at that part. What ever would happen if a small group of people was richer than the rest?!
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:17:38
My first transaction before I knew anything was 5 dollars, sent to my wallet it was 1 dollar lol. With todays fees I may not even be able to transfer something like that, I'm sitting at 20 dollar fees to move 100 out of coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:27:42
It's a reminder to never hold amounts you care about outside of your own control. Btcs transaction fees just make that a bit painful right now, people were probably waiting to spool up bigger transfers rather than multiple 4-7 dollar hits.

@_date: 2017-12-06 19:35:09
You CAN use a private wallet, and should transfer it to there. You started off saying Nicehash is not an online wallet, which is untrue because they offered an online wallet too, and payouts to there were 0.001 bitcoin minimum rather than 0.01 to external wallets, so a lot of people were using that before transferring it externally. 
Your second comment is completely irrelevant. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:53:11
Agreed on most everything. 


Tbh this seems super aggressive to me, but to each to his own. I'm more in the boat where crypto is my "assume I've already lost this" fund, and about 10% of what I have invested in index funds in tax sheltered accounts. 
That way by retirement, it's at worst as if 90% is all I had invested, and at best that 10% may out grow the 90% of invested money. Set for retirement in one possibility, and much richer for it in another.

Can't come soon enough. I bought more at this dip and tried to transfer out from coinbase, saw a 19CAD fee, and noped out. It's less safe, but I'm not eating a fourth of my investment with a fee! 
Hopefully the congestion goes down soon.

That last bit is what I was wondering after, so I can just expect to see some lag between the mempool quieting down and the exchange reducing fees? Do you know what the typical lag would be for coinbase?

@_date: 2017-12-08 17:44:18
Not for Canadians, and the Coinbase fee isn't even the issue, it's the network mining fee that's unavoidable. 
The coinbase fee is 4%, that's not competitive but it's whatever. The network mining fee would have eaten a third of my investment. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:15:23
The dedicated hardware for it is still very profitable. I think the Antminer S9 and such can poop you out 400 dollars worth a month still. 
If you're talking about GPU mining let alone CPU, almost no one does that for btc anymore, but rather altcoins that can still turn profits and be traded  into bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:12:59
It's 4500 bitcoin stolen away in the end, they mined whatever was most profitable but always paid in bitcoin, it was convenient for a lot of people. 
In a way, this may make the plummeted difficulty of some alts more appealing to direct mine. 
You are, of course, free to not care, it's just news. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:07:48

Yup. Shit, 7 figures? Even middling 5s? I'd take that shit out and plop it into an index fund, and let 20% continue to grow or bust in crypto. I know people believe strongly in it here, but come on, if you have enough to set yourself up for near assured success, do that. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:16:45
Cannot come soon enough, I'm amped. I saw it would be 19 dollars to move not a lot out of coinbase, so I just left it there, 4-7USD transaction fees were bad enough!

Yup. Bought some more at the dip, went to transfer out, saw a 20 dollar fee, noped out. I don't like keeping money on exchanges but that fee makes it ridiculous. 
Hoping congestion wanes overnight in the short term, but lightning really can't come soon enough, even a bunch of 4-7USD fees hurt over time. 
People just saying "lightning" and downvoting posts like these is frustrating, it may be beautiful in two years, but it ain't now. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:07:40
I saw a 19 Canadian dollar fee to move 65 dollars out of coinbase. Noped out and left it there. 
Hope the backlog dies down soon. 4-7USD transactions were bad enough, but this makes small amounts almost pointless to move. I'm also getting tired of "lightning, bro!" replies to such frustrations, I'll stop being frustrated when it comes, obviously. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:48:01
I'm Canadian so the specific translations between our accounts I don't know, but in general yes, start with your tax sheltered accounts, a few bucks thrown in there and put in an aggressive index fund can go a long way (aggressive when you're young, dial back as you age). 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:37:23
Pretty much fomo. 
Leads to a lot of buying at highs and selling at lows, that's why I'm a fan of taking the  emotion out of it with weekly buys. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:14:19
And have a buck or two left over after transfer fees...Could you even transfer 10 out of an exchange that sets its own transfer fees? I'm stuck with some in Coinbase because the 20 dollar fee would eat too much of it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:23:29

@_date: 2017-12-06 19:29:41


How about you start off with asking for information and seeing if there's something new to learn, rather than calling everyone ignorant from the get go. 
Nicehash was a mining pool and mining program, yes, but they also offered an online wallet that reduced the payout threshold to 1/10th the btc required, making it appealing for most people mining with non-ASIC  hardware to use Nicehash's online wallet before enough was pooled up to transfer out. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:15:19
Coinbase doesn't even have segwit yet and they need that first for lightning. Le sigh. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:31:13
It's the network mining fee, I don't think any of that is going to the exchange. They charge 4% and it's a lot more than that. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:34:34
Can't wait. Hopefully Coinbase integrates it soon after launch, but they don't have segwit yet and need that first too. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:29:44
Nope, unless it's a publicly known address all you really have is that hashed string of numbers. i.e we know the nicehash hackers last address they sent to, but the address does nothing for us.

@_date: 2017-12-06 22:28:10
Safety is of course always encouraged but it's not really what's going on here, there were minimum amounts of 0.01btc to withdraw to external wallets, while Nicehash's own payed at a 1/10th threshold at 0.001btc. So a lot of people were probably waiting to spool up enough to move out and repeat. 
So hopefully no one singularly lost a whole lot if they moved to a wallet they hold, as is advisable. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:17:53


So what are you basing " If it went down to 10 or 11k, that would be a correction" on? That's your personal number, right? A market correction is defined as 10%, if bitcoin corrections are made up individually it's useless to use the term and debate how much would constitute a correction. 
Only if we're using a shared definition does saying if it's a correction or not have any meaning. "10%, that's a correction" "no, because my correction is 30%" just makes little sense in debating. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:28:12
My attitude too. If I lose a few thousand in my 20s it doesn't hurt me much when I'm 60, because I was already trying to max out tax free retirement accounts first. If it continues to moonrocket, I'm just richer than I normally would have been, maybe can do more for people.

I think "waiting because of fees" is going to be a LOT of peoples story with this hack, unfortunately. A few things all went funny together on this one. 
If fees were pennies to transfer out, most people would of course only be building up to the minimum withdraw on NHs hacked accounts. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:25:18
It's cool that you love it, but if you can scrape even a few dollars a month to throw in an investment fund that could go a long way by retirement. Cryto is awesome, that's why we're all here, but think about a stable investment early too.

5 or 20 first, no one knows [but, I say probably 20]. Can't underestimate holiday pumps too, look at Thanksgiving, I think Christmas will be a lot like that.

@_date: 2017-12-03 04:30:31
That's the way. Time in the market &gt; timing the market, and dollar cost averaging like that takes all the emotional mistakes out of it. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:32:28
The coinbase fee isn't super competitive with other exchanges, but it's pretty small in comparison to the bitcoin mining fee. i.e, coinbase was 4%, but the current network fee would have eaten 30% of my investment to transfer it out due to the insane backlog right now. Not something any exchange controls, they can set lower fees but they risk the transaction dropping. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:21:02
Yeah, bummer. If the mining fees were addressed people may have been safer about moving them out to private wallets. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:04:23
At least bitcoin is up so much my total portfolio is as well, no alt was hurt so much that the gainz were undone at least with my weighting. I went pretty holy trinity heavy (btc/eth/ltc) and the latter two are a bit down from ATHs but not massively hurting. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:07:11

@_date: 2017-12-06 18:44:03
There were minimum withdraws and the fee structure didn't encourage the most safety, as well as just the bitcoin mining fees probably made people pool up more before a transfer. Hopefully most people weren't much over the minimum withdraw limit though. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:07:24

Nicehash had a 10x higher threshold to pay an external wallet rather than their online one, and a minimum payout for external wallets, so for a lot of people it was probably just spooling up to hit those minimums, and maybe bundling a bit more than that because of btcs fees right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:05:03
I was just listening to a podcast by Trace Mayer that put it a lot better than I ever could, but it was something like intangible != not real, because we all agree math is real. A system based on hard immutable math is just as real as any. 
Whether it has value behind it, well, that as always for the last forever is based on what humans think it's worth. If people think a digital, math backed system has value, it has value.

0.00000001 bitcoin is a satoshi, there's no difference other than how many satoshis. The same way 0.01 dollars is a cent, you don't have to convert 100 cents into a dollar because a dollar is just what that is.

In my own situation, I bought on Coinbase before realizing they wouldn't let you sell back as a Canadian (they added a notice in the last update I see, I sent them a few tickets about it), so the 20 dollars to transfer it out is brutal, and it can't be sold back, and I also can't use GDAX.

Once again, the fees they charge are a set rate, what I'm talking about is the network transfer fee they're setting which *is not paid to them*. The mining fee is to ensure the transaction goes through the blockchain, and paid as part of mining rewards. 
Why I expect it to go down again is it was 4-7USD before December 6th...

100% agree. I'm personally maybe more conservative than some here and crypto remains at 10% of my total investment with new money. If it goes to 0, doesn't impact my future that much because the 90% in index funds and such was what I was relying on. If it continues to moon rocket, that 10% investment could grow bigger than the 90 and I'm richer than I bargained for.

Annoyingly Coinbase doesn't tell you you can't sell back coins you bought from many countries, and GDAX asks for an US ID where coinbase did not. So for those of us that bought through coinbase thinking we could also sell back there, and only found out at the moment of selling that we could not, GDAX doesn't help. Leaving us with a double whammy on transfer fees to move to a wallet and sell somewhere else, so far as I can see.

As I understand, you will have both forms of coins "out there" regardless. You just need a supporting wallet/software update to be able to see both chains. As long as you hold your private keys tight, you should be able to redeem both types of coins with any wallet that supports both. A fork is a snapshot; if you have transactions before the snapshot in one, you have them in both. 
The reason Coinbase and other exchanges have to state that you'll get both is that exchanges are IOUs, not coins you hold. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:04:51

@_date: 2017-11-01 23:36:48


You can buy any amount you can afford, if you're buying as an investment why does it matter what the value is as a fraction of one coin? You can buy 20 bucks if that's what you have, and if it keeps rising, that's still a return. 
Doesn't really matter that people can't buy 1 whole btc anymore, its value is its value if they only see its investment.

So long as you're also ready for it cratering for whatever reason and not being able to pay it back in that week, at least not with the bitcoin. I don't think that'll happen, but it's not impossible. Invest what you can lose. 
There's also no reason you have to buy one whole bitcoin other than to have an even number of it. More, less, doesn't matter, can buy 20 bucks or 20,000. Make sure 1 bitcoin isn't just a psychological thing and that's what you want to invest.

What kind of hardware are you running? Nicehash is really easy and switches to the most profitable network and pays in bitcoin which is nice, though there's still the viability thing. I.e if your hardware is slow, mainly your GPU, the electricity may not be worth it and the payout may take so long (to get to 0.0001btc) that it may wipe the remainder before you get there (they periodically clear unpaid balances). 
At least a midrange desktop GPU from the last few years is needed to make a few bucks that way.

I've seen this argument and I can't agree with it, the "$5 fee to buy coffee is bad, $5 to secure your retirement funds is amazing" argument - but gold has intrinsic value. For Bitcoin to be able to "secure retirement funds" - it needs to be useful for something, and 5USD transfer fees make it non attractive for most normal sized transactions. 
Something has to give with those.

S&amp;P is investment capital, your money is working at something there.  Bitcoin needs to grow more useful to not worry about a correction so much. Segwit2x was managed poorly, but the transaction fees do need to be addressed, otherwise it's everyone buying in just for the price to rise, and vulnerable to a drop that way. 
I get downvoted here every time without a real answer, but really - that guy who said it was bad for coffee, but good for securing your retirement fund with $5 fees? How will it stay valuable enough to do the latter when it can't be used for much else? I'm genuinely wanting an answer. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:19:13
For sure, pretty sure private wallets were around before exchanges came up too
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:54:32
People were buying in for "free" forked coins, anything before the snapshot would exist in both chains so you'd have legacy bitcoins and segwit2x. So if you could sell one or the other and reinvest, you'd still be up a bit, even if the price was overinflating. 
Without that, everyone looking for that free boost is leaving. And the problem of bitcoin transaction fees is yet to be solved to be more viable for non massive scale investments.

That 980GT is your best bet. The CPU can add a few dollars a month maybe, but may not be worth the electricity cost (unless it's free). 
Use a Nicehash wallet so payout threshold is down to 0.001btc rather than 0.01btc.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:12:20
So, why exactly would it continue to hold its value forever (and grow forever) if the fees make it so it's not useful outside of very large value transactions, or "life savings"? I sure as heck wouldn't trust my life savings to it if it has no other use. 
To retain value as a life savings vehicle as this tweet proposes, it HAS to have other uses, and 5 dollar fees run contrary to most things. 
I ask something like this and get downvoted, I'm really looking for an answer here: Why would large sums be trusted to stay valuable in it if it's unworkable high fee for most things? It's not investment capital making money elsewhere. Fees have to drop for his "retirement fund" to stay valuable. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:25:23
I guess I must have set a country during setup, because it shows in the app, unless it used location services. At the time of buying, it never told me I could not sell back due to the country, so I assumed I could use the same exchange because I had no reason to even think otherwise. 
Kind of shitty. So to move into my wallet, 6 dollars, to move into another exchange, another fee, so 12 dollars or more just to buy and sell. All I needed was a warning at the time of buying that this may happen, I would have backed out and found a Canadian exchange.

You and me both lol. I seem to be the harbinger of a dive/correction every time I buy in, of course that probably just means I need to realize I succumb to hype easily and buy too high/too early during a correction. 
Ah well. The plan was to Hodl for years anyways.

Luckily you'll never have to, just have your 12 (or more) word recovery phrase written down somewhere you won't lose and you can re-build the wallet and keys.

The USD is fiat money for the entire global system, on a global scale individuals would look for something else, even if Little Kim somehow made all of America a wasteland (doesn't have the nukes or range).

Windows is even more of a risk. It's not that slow on my iPhone, I just use it there, but I'm also looking at other wallets (did you end up moving yours?)

Hah, I was going to write something like that but yours is wittier. Exactly it, a lot of articles from these big publications just seem like someone started reading Quora on bitcoin an hour ago. This one at least makes sense and explains divides in philosophy fairly well. Go figure, it's by an external correspondent who followed the space since 2011.

Exactly. 
I split my bet by doing both, getting some before so I get both, and then will invest the remainder after the inevitable dip.

If you keep your wallet on an offline PC, and you wanted to add more funds to it, you'd have to connect it to refresh, right? Or at least to see the coins moved to it, while they'd already be there in the network? 
Just curious, as apparently I'm a very dumb boy with my Windows jaxx wallet lol, I'm familiar with Linux so I could do that. Or just keep my iOS wallet.

I didn't know better when I first started a while ago and transferring 5 dollars from coinbase to my wallet left me with...1 dollar. Oof.

I'd get all three Coinbase offers. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin. The latter two tend to hedge any dips in bitcoin (which have always recovered, but still), so the three together have a much more stable total portfolio growth. 
You don't, by the way, have to buy one whole bitcoin. You can do $500 of each for instance, the fraction of a coin doesn't much matter, the value does. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:04:57
Scarcity just adds value. A LOT of the early mined bitcoins are probably like that, key on some old dusty forgotten computer or formatted and lost to time.

3% on a 10 dollar purchase is meh. $5 on a 10 dollar purchase makes something nigh unusable as a daily currency, and if it can't work for daily things, why will it continue to hold value forever for larger things? 
Chargebacks probably suck for you as an owner, but more people are buyers and don't worry about that. Bitcoin fees make it hard to work with right now, that's just fact, I and many here say this not to dump on it but because we hope for a solution. Hand waving the problem away with credit card fees gets us nowhere. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:08:25
People before the dip: I wish it would dip so I can buy more!   
People during the dip: Oh shit it's crashing! No time to buy more! 
People after the dip: I wish I bought more during the dip!
I suspect there's not insignificant overlap between each of the three (not saying OP was), lol 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:01:23
People were buying in for "free" forked coins, anything before the snapshot would exist in both chains so you'd have legacy bitcoins and segwit2x. So if you could sell one or the other and reinvest, you'd still be up a bit, even if the price was overinflating.
Without that, everyone looking for that free boost is leaving. And the problem of bitcoin transaction fees is yet to be solved to be more viable for non massive scale investments.

The Lightning Network is a proposed solution, but it's been 18 months away for four years if you catch my drift, and would also need miner consensus again (risking another fork, though the fork is lowered now since people wanting a fork have other forks to choose from already)

Dick eating memes are fine and dandy, but we all know he's also doing weekly pump and dumps through his 'coin of the week' stuff, right? He wants the price to go higher, and so do we, but that doesn't make him anything but a profiteer, far short of an oracle.

For Ethereum it depends, as it's not a limited supply coin like Bitcoin. Vitalik did discuss creating value for holders through proof of burn mechanisms reducing the number of coins in supply, but we'll have to see.

It'll be 120 years, so it'll be a minute before we have to consider the last coined mined...But scarcity only increases when demand grows faster than supply, so it would depend on what's happening then. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:10:49
Rousing argument there lad, but Vitalik himself was discussing Ethereums lack of a hard cap and how to create value through burn, so I'm not sure which part is 'simply not true'.

When it would probably be more prudent to do the opposite. Markets shit themselves, gold running high? Sell some of the gold position and put it in a down market, if you're in it for the long term.
