Wow bro get your bible verses out of here. I can show you plenty of hatred in all religious books. And then you ask for tips. typical of religion, huh? This is a big boy game. No one is going to hold hands.

You took charity money and put it in Bitcoin?!??
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:10:09
Buying more Bitcoin doesn't make sense
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:55:08
Yes. Your coins value will continue rising. However, you must transfer the coins back to an exchange such as coinbase to sell for fiat or you c an us localbitcoins.com

You would like to artificially inflate the price? Even if that was possible it's not good long term for Bitcoin.

I am in New Zealand at the moment but will back in florida shortly. I have crewed on maxi yachts before between Tasmania and Australia. All I did really is grind and fold sails and sit for hours. I can sail a dinghy alright in bay waters. I will be ordering these books ASAP and will contact you again upon arriving at the moon.

The question was, "what is your investment strategy?"
Wtf are you talking about?
Take your library card and gtfo

Use your secret phrase on a new wallet. You will see your updated funds. This has happened to me before.

I'm at the tail end of an acid trip. This comment made me.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:06:02
Or perhaps keep your super low interest mortgage that is tax deductible and use the money to build a real estate portfolio? I'm just a guy

This happened to me and a friend. I freaked out. Jaxx is being glitchy. Download blockchain wallet. Put in your 12 words and recover wallet. Boom, your funds should be there. Stop using jaxx. Let me know how it goes

Yes, I get it. The question is, from a risk vs. reward ratio, is it more sensible to sell segwit2x as a futures or wait until the actual fork
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:00:24
Hey, thanks for that! What will you be doing with your Segwit2x?
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:58:46
PM me the details

I sent you a micro amount of Bitcoin. Use it wisely! (Don't use it)
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:31:24
Show proof with your username as well in the photo. I will also shoot some bitcoin your way. Y que no se te olvide poner la dirección donde mandar la moneda
