having a decentralized financial network does not mean our whole political structure should be decentralized as well... i don't appreciate these attempts to create an absolute association between bitcoin and anarchy.

is there data for how many more unique bitcoin owners there are? the high number of transactions would only interest me if it were together with an increase in unique purchasers.
the same number of people contributing to a high number of transactions would seem not to help too much in terms of increasing the value of bits

i think by "the whole industry will follow" he is referring to the greater increase of bitcoin usage when large industries start using it as a currency, which will undoubtedly help the whole platform.

*"The company has “great interest in cultivating relationships with [other Bitcoin companies] that share the same goal as us: to broaden the adoption of digital money, by increasing liquidity and encouraging those that hold it to spend it, rather than hold onto it for speculative purposes.”*
This is nice and all, but more so than sheer transaction volumes, bitcoin needs to address the underlying challenges of proving to consumers its worth as a currency. Currently, I believe the security and ownership values of bitcoin do not appeal to the layman enough for him or her to go through the trouble of converting dollars (or w.e. currency) for bitcoins.
I think the "coolness" and novelty aspect is contributing to its usage right now but there is a need for a greater reason that supports exclusive use of bitcoins.
This is just an ideal but suppose a company like Apple declares it will only accept bitcoins as payments. Something like THAT will be the true driver for the adoption of bitcoins by the shopping masses.

i don't think it looks stupid and worthless.. maybe it's because i'm familiar with using korean won (1usd ~ 1,000won) but i don't find it ridiculous equating the number 100,000 in won with just $100 usd.

i think one of the biggest problems bitcoin will face is the implications of a greater wealth inequality than we currently have. 
i understand many justify this inequality by saying "they took that initial risk and have been rewarded for it" (which i think is only true to a certain extent because some people were much more equipped to make those "risks"), but that alone should not excuse problems associated with wealth inequality. the top 1% owning more wealth than the bottom 90% should not seem fair to anyone.
currently however, the top HALF A PERCENT own more than  67% of bitcoins. that's worse than the extant inequality without bitcoins where the top 1% own about 50% of the world's wealth (
does anyone else see this as big a problem as i see it?

this is a great video.

i think it's important to consider and address opposition pieces like this.
in particular i found his concern about the potential emergence of monopolistic dominant organizations to be relevant. even though the one of the main value propositions for bitcoin is decentralized trust -- we, the lay-bitcoiners who aren't developers/miners and cannot do anything with the code, place an overwhelming amount of trust and "faith" into random individuals to keep the system running. and perhaps it is the case that we may end up giving too much trust
that said, he does sound a bit butthurt, with his ad-hominem attack toward bitcoin users in the last section of his writing.
@_date: 2014-11-08 04:33:10
There needs to be greater incentives for the use of bitcoins that would increase its demand to drive the price up.
Currently the layman doesn't care/understand enough about its security/ownership benefits to consider it as a currency worth using in lieu of the dollar (or whatever currency of his country)
Something like ChangeTip is sure to help bitcoin because it gives people exclusive reasons to own the coin, especially if the platform were to be integrated with services like Facebook (tipping whenever you "like" something). Personally, however, I think that if we really want a gigantic price increase (like Draper's prediction of 10k USD per btc), bitcoin needs to establish itself as the preferred currency for a major economic activity.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:52:45
More than trying to make a difference, I think they're just insanely incentivized to ensure that bitcoin is widely adopted. Owning 1% (I'm willng to bet they have more) of an entire currency will grant them unimaginable wealth.

"and it will all be due to an anonymous genius who gave his/her/their invention away for free."
only partly true -- satoshi stands to arguably benefit the most from mass-adoption of bitcoins

you first ask him to point out some of the "fundamental flaws" he claims, and when he does provide them (quite well), you simply say "your concerns aren't unique and have been addressed"

haha i didn't mean for it to come across as jealous. i own a fair bit (still in the 1-100 range though) and hope that bitcoin's value will increase too.
i also don't mean to put myself on a pedestal but i just have a heart for the poor and i hope to be able to make a meaningful contribution in the decreasing of income inequality

to be fair as one of the first hires at coinbase, i'm willing to bet that he possesses considerable knowledge and skill in using bitcoin's features to control his money the way he wants.
i think the beauty of bitcoin is not that an individual is completely separated from a third party in the handling of her money, but rather that an option is extended to the individual by which she can have that absolute control previously not possible.
bitcoin empowers, not replaces
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:48:54
i think a few layers of irony here.
first, i don't think bitcoin represents full "freedom" from government and it will not make governments irrelevant. in fact, if bitcoin ends up developing as a settlement network, various layers of compliance will be integrated into different systems using bitcoin.
but even granting that it will, its supposed pro-liberty use cases will not actually be use cases unless there's a significantly large number of people using bitcoin. so when you say "i won't let anyone ruin it for me", it frankly sounds farcical. what does that even mean? 
furthermore, even if there were a change in the direction of the protocol that you didn't like, what do you think you can do? bitcoin is only "decentralized" insofar as the different numbers of miners, but look at the current state of our miners and how large yet few in number they are. so again, what can you do?


decentralization by definition means the system includes even those kinds of actors.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:20:32
core isn't really following "satoshi's plan" but BU really isn't either.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:21:21
my God. the level of contradiction in this sub is incredible. 
on one hand we have an upvoted post from szabo that makes fun of jihan for complaining that "markets are unfair."
and the same group of people upvotes that post is concerned about market manipulation if we let a fork be??
bitcoin has opened its door to so many of the masses that too large of uneducated, ill-informed members who think they know shit have begun to speak.
you know what this reminds me of? the fucking idiocy and contradictions rampant in the partisan divide of US politics. two sides full of bigotry that doesn't see commonground.
i will hold bitcoins because the system won't fail and it will add some chunk of change to my net worth.
however, the original vision of bitcoin has failed.
people are too stupid.

we have apple at 700b marketcap, google at 600b, microsoft at 500b, and amazon at 400b.
there can be multiple giants in an industry.
why some people hold such narrow views and limit themselves escapes me
@_date: 2016-12-16 15:54:08
the irony in this post is uncanny.
this doesn't even have anything to do with BU. the miner is acting entirely within the rules set by the bitcoin protocol and to attempt to pressure him into acting against his will is incredibly alarming and antithetical to the very motivation for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-23 17:33:09
well, it'll be something we'll have to wait to see since none of us can tell the future, so it's meaningless to argue about whose projections will actually occur.
but in terms of why i believe privacy may be reduced once payment channels open up, is because of general tendency of humans to begin colluding and forming centralized entities (like what we've seen in mining). in that case, there may come a day when on-chain transactions are simply too expensive for everyone's usage and they'll have to use channel hubs that reduce privacy further than what improvements in coinjoin provide.
i have no doubt that segwit/ln will enable proper scalability, and even enable the super-microtransactions that are not meaningfully possible right now. but i believe the cost will be less privacy than what we have today.
hopefully that's not the case, but we'll see what happens

insiders aren't surprised by this news at all; circle was never about bitcoin.
jeremy allaire wants to truly enable frictionless payments between individuals globally and is doing what he believes is necessary to achieve that goal.
not sure if this was the right step, but i respect the man greatly and wish circle the best.

guys i'm all for segwit here but as a long time participant i find the moderation in r/bitcoin disappointing, once again.
when ethereum was taking off, any discussion of ethereum, even when it had clear relevance to bitcoin was removed because it was an alt. why is a post on litecoin the top page?
because it's related to segwit? 
i'm sure there are many like me, who have been here long enough, and find the mods here quite suspect. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 05:12:23
no. actually segwit will be the means by which bitcoin is turned into something governments find more "agreeable"
note that i'm not making any normative statement about whether segwit is good or bad.
i don't care which route bitcoin takes (BU or core), as long as it succeeds and is able to enable a much more improved financial system from the status quo.
if it fails at fulfilling a particular virtue, another solution will arise to address that

This is merely rhetoric.
We can also view it as:

Facebook, a single company, provides the largest centralized platform for media content.
Alibaba, a single company, provides one of the largest centralized platforms of purchasing items.
Airbnb, a single company, provides one of the largest centralized platforms of finding accommodation.
Now the question we want to ask ourselves is, do we want a:
______, a single company, provides the largest centralized service for bitcoin transactions?
