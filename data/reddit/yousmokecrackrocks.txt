If you are so new to economics, technology and bitcoin itself, then how can you proclaim that this video is good at explaining these things?
Why did you elect to make commentary on something which you yourself admit you have no clue about?

Except it's 100% false and wrong all over. How is this good?
You really know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about economy?

Teenagers want to be rebellious. Bitcoins main theme in the media the past 3 years has been exactly that, rebellion.
Most teenagers who know about Bitcoin know about it because it's something exciting, not because they genuinely give a fuck about the corrupt banking system, corrupt wallstreet, corrupt government, inflation or anyt of these things. Why should kids care about these things? They have exactly zero real life experience that matters in that field.
It's also quite weird to be surprised that a geeky teacher knows about it. It's not like Bitcoin is special knowledge anymore, it's about as wellknown as you can get at this point.

You're clearly an immature child who just recently discovered logical fallacies and will for the next 6 months keep posting them at everyone without it even making sense in the context.

By dirty you mean paying for ads?
Stop thinking that corporations are somehow evil, Bitcoin isn't about communism. Cryptocurrencies are supposed to free the world, with freedom comes responsibility. If you disagree with this service's practices the solution is simple; don't use them! Imposing your censorship on them is not mature at all.

Bitcoin really need to stop this silly shit.
"guerilla marketing" like this makes Bitcoin looks non-serious and bullshit.
