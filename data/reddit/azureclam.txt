Good to hear your post was better received here in !

Actually you are breaking the NAP by telling a Captain of Industry what they can or cannot use their ASICs for.

The exchanges of course.

No, actually credit card fees are often upwards of 110%, or so I've been told by @_date: 2017-03-20 11:35:53
Segwit is a Rube Goldberg style solution which will act as a band-aid for a glaring design flaw, by permanently complicating the protocol. Therefore it's good for bitcoin.

Your worst enemy has always been yourselves.
@_date: 2017-03-30 23:50:40


Yeah, Ethereum for example.

Of course not, there'll always be some excuse.

Smart responsible people keep their bitcoins safely buried under a birdbath forever
@_date: 2017-04-24 14:12:43
It must be very hard being the smartest and most knowledgeable person around.
@_date: 2017-04-23 13:56:08
