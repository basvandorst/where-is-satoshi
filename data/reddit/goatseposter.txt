Pretty much!  I don't gamble with my BTC trying to profit from day trading.  I am in it for the long haul.  I just keep accumulating.

Whenever a store offers BTC as a payment option, I use it.  I find it much easier than entering credit card information; and I appreciate the power inherent in sending them my payment, rather than asking for them to negotiate with a third party to have it withdrawn from a fourth party's account on my behalf.
I already buy on a schedule, so I just add whatever I spent (in fiat), plus 5-10%, to the next buy amount.  A few hundred dollars' difference in BTC/USD doesn't matter to me because BTC isn't done yet.

Creating multisig segwit addresses with one of the keys on a Ledger seems impossible with Electrum. 
@_date: 2018-09-29 06:58:20
it's easier to buy btc, though.

more people using bitcoin doesn't mean bitcoin uses more power...
miners and users are decoupled

... understood; I was too hasty in my initial reading.
and anyway: yes, you are correct.

I had to pay a 10% markup the last time I got (a small amount of) cash from an ATM to pay for something.  I've never paid that much in BTC exchange or transaction fees for similar amounts.  Just sayin'.
@_date: 2019-08-28 23:20:12
indeed.  "market cap" is almost meaningless in this space.

... so it'll make people think harder about what they really want before spending their money.  they'd still spend their coins on necessities like food and shelter, but might tend toward thrift.  this isn't a bad thing in a world that needs less mindless consumption and waste.

idk what Bitcoin Knots is, but to install Bitcoin Core, the following will work, assuming you have a build environment and all the dependencies...:
    $ git clone 
    $ cd bitcoin
    $ git checkout v0.19.0.1
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build 
    $ ../autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local
    $ ../configure --prefix=/usr/local
    $ make -j$(($(nproc)+1)) -l$(nproc)
    $ sudo make install
If `configure` breaks, install whatever it's asking for (a -dev package probably, for header files, etc.) and try again.
To start it, run `bitcoind`.  To interact with the daemon, use the `bitcoin-cli` tool.
The relevant config file is `~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf`.  You can do something like `tail -f ~/.bitcoin/debug.log` to watch what `bitcoind` is doing.
An example config file lives here, in the git repo:  
There is plenty of documentation here, also in the git repo, about dependencies, configuration, and more!:

(Here, I'll put my comment at the top level also, where it might be useful.)

why would this happen?  you describe a case in which a majority of miners has left.  transaction fees will still exist; they will need to increase to make up for the diminishing block reward.  increased volume can and will do this.  (hopefully most of us will be using something like LN so "real" transaction volume will be much higher than on-chain volume, and the fees will be shared among millions of transactions.)  perhaps this distant future will see a block size increase, which would further increase fees per block.  why should we assume that there will suddenly be no miners after a difficulty adjustment?

just want to say that studying the mass of a neutrino is hardly straightforward, because the neutrinos created by the weak interaction (e.g. radioactivity via beta decay in the Earth, or nuclear fusion in the Sun and other stars) exist as a mixture of the possible mass eigenstates and don't have definite mass.  "what are the neutrino masses" is currently one of the most difficult unsolved problems in physics. :)

a new fork would not be bitcoin; maybe they'd call it something dumb to confuse the newbies though, like "bltcoin" or perhaps "bitcoin cash".

perhaps you'd be interested in the diaspora network.

well technically, something like dogecoin was already a far cheaper way to send an even smaller amount of "money" around the world, and has been for years.  bitcoin (with the LN) is only better in this regard due to greater adoption, and the peripheral ability to exchange even relatively large amounts of it directly for local currency.

the meme is that people buy drugs with bitcoin, right?
... so why do they do that, instead of hodling it?
people apparently care about more than money.

hey look at that, some lines on a chart.  did you know that you can draw different lines depending on how much you zoom in or out?  the possibilities are *limitless*!  so much fun!

underrated comment imo.
do most people know how credit cards or checks work under the hood?
I think not.
this is a big step toward becoming "dumb" enough for mainstream use.

it seems like the cell provider should be on the hook for anything stolen as a result of their fuckup.
@_date: 2019-05-21 01:22:25
basically, don't store your coins on someone else's computer where your phone number can be used to authenticate you.  if you alone know the private keys, nobody else can steal them from you without breaking into your computer &amp; stealing them [if they're unencrypted], or employing the $5 wrench maneuver and convincing you to share them.
similar problems exist wherever e-mail can be used to e.g. get a temporary link to change your password.
