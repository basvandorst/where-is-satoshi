JS could be a part of your straight line. You could join or create a project/app as a web or react native developer.
Considering you were in sales you would know how to market/sell your project.

Bitcoin is just the first one to gather their attention. They will address other cryptos as well.

The difference (looking at just the transactions) is mainly in how much the technology has been battle tested. Bitcoin withstood attacks from many fronts for 10 years. The tech behind NANO has yet to be tested in this way.

This wouldn't really help anyway, as the wallet server would need a way to retrieve the private keys. The hackers would just use the same method.
And of course the insiders :)

For buying bitcoins Bitstamp is a great exchange, with low fees (compared to other gateways). 
For crypto to crypto trading most people use Binance or Bittrex.

On the long run you earn exactly the same ROI per hash. Regardless of the total hashpower you own.
Why would they make more because of low hardware costs? They get payed for hashrate, not based on initial costs. 
Sounds like a scam to me.
Edit: Spelling

Depends on what part of coding you want. HTML and JS are easy starts, where you see the results instantly.
There are tons of videos and web content. If you need help picking one just let me know.

Difficulty was lower, but probably not that much lower. The exponential part is obviously false.

I think you should get a parrot. Will really boost your app numbers.

Bitstamp is a very reliable fiat gateway.

You should probably report them as stolen though, just to be safe.

The safest way is to sell on a exchange. If you want to do it more P2P you can try localbitcoins or just look for people in your area, that will buy them.
Bitcoin ATMs are also an option, but they charge high fees.

Greed is strong. 
Yes, this sounds a lot. But if you just bought BTC with the $3500 a year and a half ago you would have a lot more than 2.5 BTC.
Mining profits depend mostly on your electricity cost, so I cannot really estimate them without this number.

Do I see a big red bubble next to his name? :)
