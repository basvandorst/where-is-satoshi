It's not "info", it's my opinion on what's happening, based on my logic. Take it with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2019-07-01 12:16:53
"True moon" is when fiat doesn't even exist, and the world has transitioned entirely to blockchain-based currencies. It will be a long road before that happens, but I can see it happening.
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:27:34
That's a pretty tame prediction, I like it.
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:29:59
The way I read the situation right now is simply whales/businesses, especially big mining contenders are selling to secure profits for the year. They don't want to sell TOO MUCH and kill the bullish trend, instead they bring the market down to a support and wait for buying pressure to resume. It was kinda likely that this would happen, given the market movement at the beginning of 2018. If I had to wager, I would say we're going to keep drawing waves on the price chart for a while. You could argue that it's not very likely for BTC to get anywhere near the ATH in the short term.

Funnier than the comment is the fact that it got 4 upvotes.
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:48:32
In the end of the day, altcoins are only a bunch of startup businesses trying to ride the BTC wave or downright scams. They don't represent the people, they represent the goals of their developers. Gotta avoid 'em like the plague.

I have a magic power, when I sell any amount of BTC, the price goes up immediately. But I will save that power for later, the mana cost is too high.

If price finds acceptance under 6k, dark times are ahead for hodlers. But it's easier said than done.
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:31:24
I suggest you do that now, then. Anything between $6000 and $7000 (even a bit higher) is a great price to pay for a bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-25 12:19:03
With each day it looks more likely that it will breach the long-standing $6k support. With that said, we could see an end-of-year rally, after all, we are back at pre-2017-boom levels. 
Aaaaand naturally in 2019 there's the Mt.gox forced hodlers becoming potential bears.
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:31:10
Seen worse ones, this is just news overreaction due to earlier dip.
@_date: 2018-09-17 21:46:31
This kind of price movement is normal in bitcoin history and has been witnessed many times. Abnormality is when you see a $3000+ spike (or drop) in a matter of a week or two.
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:39:30
Nothing to worry about, this really looks like an orchestrated plot. You should only be truly concerned if Bitcoin falls under $5500.
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:35:33
Bitcoin has consistently defended the $6000 mark. That makes it good grounds for a buy.
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:37:33
No news, just whale succubuses tempting your weak hands
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:36:31
Much to the contrary. I have seen numerous dips but not one so steep in the 1h chart. There were a few, to be honest, that resemble it.
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:34:56
Just curious, what would you consider "high" right now?
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:28:52
More accurately, from $7400 to $6900 within 2 hours. Very strange as I have never seen that quick a drop, it may be an exchange manipulating bulls into selling.

This is some whale buying, 1 positive hour with 6k BTC volume. If you look at volume history, the recent volume spikes are all on the bear side. This could be a turnover, either that or a bull trap.

Check on the block explorer how right before each BTC rally there is a huge amount of Tether being printed. Whenever bears are almost breaching $6k, Tether prints and buys the dip to "save the day". This isn't FUD, I am an iron hodler, just putting cards on the table here as I dont quite trust Tether.

@_date: 2018-05-04 14:57:46
A little data for anyone who may want some insight: My last four bitcoin purchases (from most recent to least recent) were at $9060, at $7200, at $6700 and at $6350.
Around $500 equivelent purchased each time. I consider myself a casual buyer.

Seems very close to me. Don't you see the signs? It refused to give in to the bears, the 6k flag bears wave is not happening. A rally is in the oven and it's gonna be big. It will be short lived as a lot of weak hands who bought at the big december hype wave will want to dump, but you'll have the chance to sell some of your BTC to rebuy later.
@_date: 2018-05-22 23:23:56

@_date: 2018-05-06 13:10:42
You're a fool for trading bitcoin for something less trustworthy than it. Just hold and pretend the coins are not even there. A paper wallet works wonders because there will be an obstacle for you to spend them (you'll only do it when you really want to) I bought most of my coins at 5.3k and did not sell even when BTC was at 19k. Could have made money there, but chose not to sell.

Wanna know what I think? I think that anything equal or lower than $7k is an excellent buy price. If you still want to buy in at current price, monitor what's gonna be like for the next hours (how much it flirts with 10k).
Do you honestly believe that bitcoin won't EVER again fall to 6k-7k levels? It's more likely for it to happen than it is for it to not happen, bear that in mind.
HOWEVER, with that said, if you plan to just hold long term, any time is a good time (except right after massive rallies) imo.

You in fact don't "possess" Bitcoin. What you possess is a secret key that entitles you to spend the amount that's on an address in the network. If that address has an amount of Bitcoin assigned to it, and you possess the secret key to that address, you can spend that amount. It's as simple as that.

@_date: 2018-05-06 13:15:17
I believed it'd breach 10k, but it didn't. We gotta have patience however, as we are now dealing with an organic price increase and not a hype driven one. We will moon slowly and properly.

Even at 9k it's a bad decision to sell. A rally can happen at any time now. Selling means risking missing it.

When a large crash like this happens, "everyone" is so afraid of buying (it could crash further). But that's where the smart buy, if they have good reasons for doing so. No one can win in this market by following the mainstream. By the time the mainstream starts buying again, it will be quite higher.
@_date: 2019-03-19 16:49:49
You do understand that if bitcoin reaches that kind of price, it threatens fiat, right?
@_date: 2019-03-19 22:30:27
Before it falls, you don't know if the rise is permanent or not. Suppose you have a small fraction of a bitcoin and that by December 2019, BTC sits at almost $20k, with indicators saying it will break the ATH. What will you do?

@_date: 2019-03-10 23:54:39
You don't need to take the seeds. You can modify the hardware wallet to create transactions targeting rogue addresses instead of the ones you intend to send coins to. If you vault coins in it, the moment you try take them out is the moment you'll lose them. You could buy a legit hardware wallet, tamper the hardware/software and resell it, ultimately you'd get whatever's stored in it. One'd probably even play it smart, and only modify transactions large enough. If a lot of wallets start stealing coins, people will catch on quickly.
@_date: 2019-03-27 12:36:22

@_date: 2019-03-06 22:27:18
I've said this already somewhere else, but yes it's going to be slow for sure, just think of how many people got swept by the sand castle rally and are now sitting ducks at a loss, some having most money they had or being in debt after taking loans (yes people actually did this). Expect a barrage of bear waves with each landmark reached by the bulls from now on.
@_date: 2019-03-27 12:34:55
Nah, the internet is a better comparison. When the internet was created, media everywhere was saying that it would never work, that it would never revolutionize the world. This happens every time something - that can fundamentally and majorly change society - is invented. Bitcoin could actually be that, if it can overcome the roadblocks preventing mainstream adoption. 
Imagine your grandma holding bitcoin securely without knowing anything technical, going to the supermarket and paying with Bitcoin as easily as she swaps a credit card. If anything close to that becomes possible, then BTC will shine.

@_date: 2019-03-09 18:50:32
The risk of losing your coins is, by logic, greater when you use a hardware wallet then when you use a properly secured offline computer. Unless you can provably state with 100% certainty that the hardware wallet wasn't tampered in any way and does not contain a mechanism from the manufacturer designed to steal assets.
@_date: 2019-03-09 18:41:47
It's different, because entity that made hardware wallets expect cryptocurrency to be stored in them. Using them means at the very least you're trusting the manufacturer's reputation AND the distributor. Old computers couldn't have been modified to steal coins, as an above answer points out.
@_date: 2019-03-20 18:29:53
I wouldn't be so sure of that. Over two times it happened with me, I was dead sure it wouldn't go under X ever again, and it went under.
@_date: 2019-03-19 12:18:56
At least where I live, the media still mentions BTC quite often. Although nearly always it is to alert new investors of the high risks of investing in it (bit of a negative propaganda as there's much more to BTC than just being a high risk asset).
@_date: 2019-03-09 19:00:39
The longer the better. Best case scenario, the bear tantrums stop only after we are dead. Just joking.
@_date: 2019-03-09 18:34:12
I don't like hardware wallets because you never know if someone has tampered with them, and ultimately you're trusting the manufacturer as well. Even if you perform a procedure to check if it's untampered. They're devices made with the sole purpose of storing cryptocurrency. It just feels much safer to me to use a generic device, a normal, old computer, without any internet access whatsoever. Those couldn't have been tampered to steal coins, no matter what.
@_date: 2019-03-15 21:41:31
what if it dips at that time
@_date: 2019-03-28 16:19:37
Although I can't even guarantee you that $60k won't happen this year. Remember the 2017 bull market when it went from $1k to almost $20k, doesn't take calculations to know that's almost twenty times the price. $60k is 15x the current price ($4k). Unlikely? Maybe. Impossible? No.
@_date: 2019-03-09 20:03:34
Lambo is overrated, Bitcoin pizza moon for the win!
@_date: 2019-03-09 19:54:41
You just said it yourself, nobody who made an old computer made it expecting it to deal with cryptocurrency transactions, so the possibility of your coins being compromised e.g. transaction data being modified, is void. The only risks with an older computer are the PC breaking (causing the loss of the amount stored), it being compromised through an infected external drive being connected to it, or a TEMPEST attack.
A hardware wallet may be an offline computer with a tiny surface, but everyone who makes or distributes one knows EXACTLY what it will be used for, because of that. A malicious manufacturer can create software or hardware mechanisms to steal assets under certain conditions, whereas a malicious distributor can tamper devices to achieve similar ends. It's offline, but it can still create rogue transactions destined to addresses controlled by these malicious parties, instead of where you want to send the coins.

It's high risk, you could've bought at $20k and be a sitting duck with less than 1/4 of your investment now. That's risk on my book. However it is a high risk I can accept because I believe in the tech and its adoption over time.
@_date: 2019-03-27 12:26:08
That's why I used the wording "current bottom". I can say that, in the past, we had a $6k bottom. The bottom was breached, and ceased to be a bottom. That's how I view it. Imagine the bottom of a well. It currently is the bottom of the well, but what if, for some reason, I dig deeper to increase the size of the well? Then that bottom is no longer the bottom, but before, it was.

@_date: 2019-03-19 16:45:57
Say you never held BTC but you suddenly saw it rapidly rising, from $6k to $8k, then to $10k, to $12, to $15k, with no end in sight. You'd feel pretty uncomfortable watching that without having anything on BTC. You can say whatever you want about the $19k mark, now that you know it's when the crazy climb stopped. But in the heat of the moment, greed would take (and has taken) control of many.

The current bottom actually sits at the $3.1k mark. But we've only visited that mark for a brief period of time, which makes a strong case that that's the bearish limit.

I'm bullish, and I've also followed BTC since 2014, but I'm gonna say it, he tries too hard to promote BTC, he's looking like an underling of McAfee, hahaha. Although no, $60k isn't impossible. It may be impossible for this year, probably, but definitely not impossible in the long run.

I believe the fall of Tether will only benefit BTC in the long run.
@_date: 2018-10-04 21:52:36
That's just normal. We had a completely abnormal price run last year. Bitcoin surged horribly -- a quick hype that quickly vanished. Lots of people are down 100%, 200% or more even (those who didn't panic sell). The aftermath was 2018 as you know it, a year of correction. The so-called "support level" of $6k is merely what it was before this abnormal surge started back in Q4 2017.
  
Right now it's a battle of that support against the correction we've been watching all year long. In my opinion, it looks like it's over, and that's why I hodl BTC.

1. A lot of people got in the hype wave and got burned by an artificial price boost. These people are despairing pretty much as they are watching what they believe is "losing all they have". Bad news on top of bad news causes whales to sell and the despairing hands follow. The loss of $6k support means extremely increased despair as we have not gone under that for ages. A test of $5k is probable (that's the previous bottom before $6k was set). Eventually as it gains awareness it will recover everything but that might not happen until the end of the year.
@_date: 2018-06-08 13:22:45
You'll endure this "torture" for as long as you think it is a torture. This situation sits perfectly OK with me. I of course would enjoy a rally, but I don't care about the volatility and slow seasons. This little season is actually pretty encouraging since Bitcoin has been consistently defining higher bottoms.

Ever since the big December spike, Bitcoin has never gone under $6k, and now seems to not go under $7k; This is looking better and better, as the agreed upon "base price" is only getting higher.

People claim that Bitcoin is dying because they either are ignorant or have something to lose with the technology's acceptance. Whenever something game changing (e.g. internet) is invented, a similar process happens. I don't however recommend investing in something you do not understand; Do your own research first.

Just out of curiosity, how much have you bought?
@_date: 2018-06-03 21:42:39
Eventually it will climb. It can take a good amount of time for that to happen as bitcoin has slow seasons. That's normal and healthy. If you want to make good money, you need to stay faithful and believe in the technology. Bitcoin has a long road ahead to reach mass awareness, and when it does achieve that, things will look very pretty for the loyal holders.
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:45:39
And how exactly can one try to steal BTC from someone from a tx hash? If that was possible, Bitcoin wouldn't even be a thing :P
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:35:18
If you needed it, you shouldn't have bought BTC in the first place. Now that you did buy BTC, you might as well want to wait, as it is in the middle of an open air bull trend with no clear short term ceiling yet.

The cost of not watching your portfolio taking losses might be watching your portfolio grows smaller as it runs up.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:41:11
Well, I believe part of the bull trend is already an effect of the upcoming halving.
@_date: 2019-02-26 20:15:38
That's almost equivelent to selling, because 1% mini dips are common.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:25:47
It can and will correct to some degree at some point, but this rise is completely different from 2017's.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:24:25
If you buy now you are running a greater risk than if you bought at $5k, so it is obvious one would be afraid of staying at a loss in the short to mid term, even if they believe it ultimately will appreciate.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:20:45
Yes, I feel you. But if its cash you are willing to risk, I'd say risk it.
@_date: 2019-02-12 20:31:23
It's true that BTC's market value is in sync across most of the world, but not every country has easy means of acquisition of BTC (e.g. exchange services), not every government accepts it, and not every country has stability in fiat. These are some of the factors that create a closed market with a higher price than the answer you get on Google when you type "bitcoin price".
@_date: 2019-02-12 20:34:54

After breaching the $10k mark like it was nothing, and further good news piling up in the radar, we're dealing with open air. It could reach up to $20k, perhaps temporarily halting a few times. It will correct at some point but its not looking like it will for now.

Like the other replier said. If I try to charge you $10 for a bottle of water, you'll think it's expensive, but if the transaction happens in a desert, you'll think it's a bargain! Similarly, fiat in Venezuela is shit which makes BTC extremely desirable (the bottle of water in the desert) and naturally hard to get. To make it worse, it's restricted there (it's a desert). There you have it.

In today's world you're forced to turn it into fiat to achieve many things. The ideal future for bitcoiners is the one you foreshadow, the future where one doesn't need fiat for anything. There is also the middle ground, where BTC and fiat coexist, and the governments prohibit the use of BTC for some kinds of transactions. Let us just imagine that in that hypothetical scenario, fiat is still needed. In that case it can easily become impossible to prove your right to own the bitcoins. I see ownership of the keys is self sufficient proof that you earned the coins, but that doesn't prove you're a thief who stole bitcoin.
So it's like a stalemate, not the inquiring party nor the inquired party can achieve their goal in this situation.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:46:07

@_date: 2019-04-25 19:06:08

If someone is a BTC user they are more tech-savvy than an ordinary individual, as BTC is not exactly something straight-forward to use; Scamming BTC users like this would, by logic, require something quite beliveable, much more robust than the usual fare you get (email spam, for example). This is an example of that. Simple, but robust attack. 
Sadly the human element is always the weakest link of any computer system.
@_date: 2019-04-06 03:15:00
Most people with large long positions probably put stop sell orders. FOMOers and some startups were the main losers. I can only imagine how much that drop in price has hurt you, but find solace in the fact there has been worse moments in BTC price history. And that you're not alone in being at a loss at that price mark.
@_date: 2019-04-10 12:07:44
Should we really expect China to not go against anything decentralized? I bet my kidney that the Chinese government is buying heaps of BTC while doing these things, trying to drive the price down so they can get it cheaper.

You're just wrong, but I'm not going to be the one to lecture you on BTC-related facts. You should do a little more research, there is even a nice sticky on reddit somewhere. Write my words, if you view BTC as an empty shell fueled by speculation, you're in for some future surprises :)

It is reasonable to infer that if BTC grows way too much, fiat-priced goods and services worldwide might skyrocket in price for their utility value. Which means that "fiat hodlers" and investors in fiat-priced assets may in fact lose a lot of money, while company owners and business investors shall remain financially stable. The people at large might see a huge decline in life quality as things will cost more everywhere and they wont earn enough to pay for what they used to. People who purchased BTC back will be considerably rich.

I actually was waiting for a bounceback to $4.5k\~ to buy more, but that seems more and more unlikely.

I suggest replacing your adblocker with ublock origin and going into options, marking all optional lists' checkboxes, excluding social blocking list, then installing the ublock origin extra companion extension, and finally, google for a unified hosts file on github (if you are under Windows), which scales the ad blocking to the entire operating system.
One could argue it is redundant to use adblockers if you use hosts files, but adblockers give you the possibility of blocking elements you see on pages and sometimes you need to temporarily empty your hosts file so you can use some website that breaks with it. I do both things.
@_date: 2019-04-05 21:46:26
A bounceback to near $4.1k levels is a very real possibility, although the price has made itself pretty comfortable on the $5k mark (going against expectation). In the past, I've witnessed a bunch of huge crashes, and I didn't mind them, I believed in a recovery. But there were times when I sold and it spiked afterward, I felt really miserable then. So personally, I much prefer holding and watching it fall than not holding and watching it spike. I actually even feel good when it dips because that gives me another good buying opportunity :)
@_date: 2019-04-11 12:51:11
If you're actually serious about that comment, I suggest you sell your BTC :)

Bitcoin is highly bad news resistant, in high contrast with the stock market. In the stock market, even a hoax of a company can potentially send the price in a nose dive. While that can happen for BTC as well, historically a LOT of bad news went by without any apparent reflection in the market whatsoever. 
Aside from the considerable amount of exchange hacks and schemes that have stolen crypto of a lot of people, a noteworthy example is the [patched bug that enabled a malicious party to create BTC above the hard cap]( That's quite some serious news, but without significant impact in price outside the trend it had been following.
@_date: 2019-04-14 02:28:43
Stablecoins are just cryptocurrencies that are convertible to fiat. If fiat dies so will stablecoins.
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:15:28
You're only thinking about the price. You need to see Bitcoin for what it is, what it has achieved, and its potential for the future. Market crashes will happen, this is the very nature of Bitcoin. You bought it when it was spiking like crazy, and the general public who never invested started FOMOing into it -- it ultimately crashed as whales started dropping their bags to realize profit. 
My advice for you? Write that money off as a loss and buy more if possible (do not spend everything you possess on BTC, not even close to that, ever). If you buy more, when BTC goes back to $19k levels you'll have more money than you started with. After that, stop caring about the price. Only look at the market very occasionally. If you see an abnormal crazy spike, you can try selling some of what you hold. If you see a crazy market crash, you can try buying. Try not to buy too far from the bottom the last major crash produced, unless you have high confidence in the price going up in the short term.
@_date: 2019-04-05 21:37:52
In other words: on any market you can only have confidence, never certainty.

You sign your transaction, I believe Electrum servers send the transaction to the network. Either way, you should be more concerned about chain analysis, because it can prove that funds ultimately originated from you. BTC you receive from an exchange is tied to your identity. 
"Anonymizing" your coins isn't exactly easy, as you can send the coins to a service that will mix them, but you're trusting that service to not keep records of that, and you're trusting the methods it employs in achieving that. The best thing you can do is find a way to exchange your coins for coins that were generated before yours, that way it becomes difficult to link the coins you originally got and the new coins you received.

You shouldn't use email for 2FA, that's kinda weak. As you yourself has seen, if one gains access to your computer and one of your browser profiles is logged in to your email, you can kiss your 2FA goodbye.

At this point I'd wager it's going up (to the $6k hurdle). People are moving out of alts and into BTC, that reinforces the immediate bullish view.

Bitcoin is only easy to manipulate when its on a period of low volume. It is a universal asset, meaning people and organizations of all kinds and with all kinds of intentions negotiate it. There may be evil whales, but there are the good whales too.

Or you can use an old computer instead, and install an offline wallet software in it. Since the private keys sit on an always-offline environment, there is no hacking it. And you can send payments with the aid of QR codes and a smartphone.

Simple math. If you invest $10 into BTC, and BTC's value grows tenfold, your profit is $90. However, if you bought a whole BTC right now paying $5140 for it, and its value grew tenfold, you'd be profitting $46.2k. If you don't invest a meaningful amount, you're just losing an opportunity. Of course if you don't have money to risk, don't risk.
@_date: 2019-04-03 12:52:43
Even if most people get greedy, many people bought close to the ATH and will be at a loss even if we get to $10k. So there's that.

Dude this is not how any market works. Your wish is an impossible utopia.

I'm hoping for a bounceback as I will get paid, so I can buy more deliciously cheap coins. That can very well happen, maybe not down to $4.1k levels, but somewhere around $4.6k. However the way things look right now, i'd wager that the $5k resistance will very soon be breached, (even if it does bounce back first) and we're going to jump quickly to the $6k area, where it will face a stronger pull. That will be the real test for the bullish case.
@_date: 2019-04-11 12:16:21
It was a fair comment. It's actually interesting to see some people still don't consider this a trend shift, I mean, look at how bullish the sentiment is right now, that's completely opposite to 2018.

If you need someone else to tell you if BTC is worth believing in, then I'd advise you to do your own research on the cryptocurrency in order to evaluate if it's something worth your support, if it's something you can get behind; Otherwise you're doing it wrong.
@_date: 2019-04-18 01:50:45
If BTC grows too easy to use and popular, people simply won't have a reason to use fiat anymore, because BTC solves all their problems and people avoid a lot of bureaucracy/fees they'd get with fiat. What benefits would fiat have?   
The problem with this hypothetical future scenario is that fiat itself would grow worthless and everything would be priced in crypto, which means that people who were late to the crypto party and don't possess valuable assets would grow poor.

Bitcoin can be enhanced via community consensus. For mainstream adoption, BTC needs to be easy enough for a complete tech newbie to use, the average grandma, for example, and BTC needs to be secure enough so it's not possible for one to just lose their money due to an accident or easily falling into a trick. Scams exist for fiat as well, so PERFECT security is impossible and shouldn't be an expectation.  
Given time and future technology advancements, these problems and more problems can be solved. I am convinced that at the time when BTC would be unsustainable without scaling, this problem will have had been solved for a long time.

Difficult to say. I bought a good amount of bitcoin under the current price, however I also bought a larger amount above, over time. The purchases weren't through the same method, not all are logged, and not all are purchases. I believe I currently have nearly the amount I have put into BTC (maybe a bit more, maybe a bit less), although I did spend a considerable amount, and I did sell some. So turns out I am in the green still.

As I explained in other replies, the more the price heads sharply to one direction, the likelier it is for a bounceback. If you bought at $19k, you were accepting a massive risk, with the $20k psychological hurdle in the horizon AFTER a massive, unparalleled spike.

The more it goes down, the harder it is for it to continue heading in that direction, unless the entire asset collapses. $6k was the norm for the entire year, so yes the fact it went under makes it a very interesting buy price.

@_date: 2019-01-17 00:01:37
Well, even though percentage wise it's more, in practical terms the more it grows the tougher it is to grow further. And the reason for that is in the post you replied to. It would be competing with the dollar and other strong fiats. In fact, a 1 million USD bitcoin would mean a market cap greater than 18.3 trillion USD market cap, that's more than dollar and gold according to a [2017 article]( so it sounds quite unrealistic. I wouldn't count on it happening anytime within the predictable future.

There is no problem with BTC's price going too high. It's very divisible. Suppose BTC reaches 1m USD someday. Then 1mbtc would be equal to $1000, and one satoshi would be equal to $0.01. All you have to do is make systems start measuring it in satoshis and all would be well. In fact it would be easier to deal with than with the whole BTC measure most use today.

Yet it's fairly accurate, for bitcoin exclusively; I don't mind if it goes down in price, **causing me to lose capital**, but I would mind if I were to sell all BTC I possess and then be forced to watch it skyrocket. If I put my money into bitcoin, on that moment I have already accepted the risk that it might go lower and I might lose capital. It's a matter of perspective, coming from someone who has been into crypto for over four and a half years.

Bitcoin is a currency. Currencies have no inherent value, its value comes from the people's acceptance of it as a   means to facilitate the exchange of goods. Bitcoin is exactly what the fiat you love so much is, except that it's global, anonymous if you use it the right way, impervious to fraud (you cannot create fake coins or transactions), cannot be seized by anyone and has known supply rate and maximum supply. Bitcoin solves real world problems, problems that nothing else solves, so although it is a currency, it's also more than a currency. And because of that, it has an inherent value. Because it is not widely used as a currency by the average person presently, people who buy it buy it because they believe it will one day become that. Those who have sold it after buying it high are just randoms who like to follow trends. They don't belong in this community of early supporters.

@_date: 2019-01-11 13:56:33
As long as you bought BTC at current value or less, I see no problem with using it as a currency. What I do is keep track of my purchase amounts so I know I can spend some BTC without "taking on losses".

@_date: 2019-01-13 00:37:23
Bitcoin is made to be spent. Hodlers hold BTC because they believe BTC is in an early phase (which is true) and that it will succeed to the point of wide adoption, thus becoming valuable by supply vs demand logic, and this means they'd be rewarded for being early supporters.

According to a very comprehensive analysis by Dephi Digital taking into account the age of moved coins, which actually has some value to it, Q1 2019 is the bottom. But being worried about prices is the wrong mindset for the bitcoin holder at this moment, in my opinion.

If you say you're holding BTC you can easily become a target, especially if someone knows you in real life. They can threaten you for example.

Do you know what whales are? They are organizations holding massive amounts of BTC. Exchanges like Bitfinex and Binance are two examples of whales. Those entities have the power to manipulate the market (and do so). Even if you were joking, this kind of sentence will just confuse people.
@_date: 2019-01-24 11:38:02
In person, exchanges, online wallets, decentralized exchanges, purchasing vouchers, crypto funded debit cards, accepting bitcoin for a service and keeping it (instead of using a service to get fiat), renting mining hardware, those are the ones that come to the top of my head.
@_date: 2019-01-28 13:06:13

@_date: 2019-01-04 18:41:43
What kind of suspicious behavior would make this verification necessary? Your system acts like a 1 BTC withdrawal is a big amount to be suspicious about. KYC is highly invasive and should only be demanded when there is no other alternative (e.g. account has potentially been hacked, traceback through blockchain analysis indicates questionable origin of the coins). If he has 2FA on the account, it's pretty hard for someone unauthorized to enter his account and request a withdrawal.
If the problem is that your system flagged him for suspicion of multiple accounts or a "dirty" ip address, what is the issue really? He deposited the 1 BTC and he wants it back, let him have it!
You're not even "confirming his identity" because you don't have it in the first place, you're demanding something you know he doesn't want to give (nobody wants) because the longer you retain coins of your customers like that, the more you can profit.
**To OP**: I believe they do send you an email with your ip address when you access, you should be able to tell them what was the first address you accessed the account with if you still have that email.
@_date: 2019-01-24 11:33:42
I can say that it's less likely for a new drop like that to happen than an end to the bearish trend.
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:28:48
Let's assume no new buyers are appearing, which is not necessarily true. That would be the present moment. The only thing that doesn't change in the universe is that EVERYTHING changes. BTC is evolving, and the ecossystem around it is evolving. You just need to look back at 2015 to see the progress that has been made. Let's not forget about the finite supply, and about the coin generation rate, that will decrease over time in a predictable matter. There is a lot of potential for BTC, you just need to read up on the subject, make your own informed decisions and be patient.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:54:03
Fact is trend followers were responsible for that pump. Those people now are jumping out of the boat. We've got to say "thank you" to the whales. Bitcoin is once again back to normal levels.

@_date: 2019-01-08 11:14:52
The true bull run will only happen when acquiring, safeguarding and spending bitcoin achieves an ease comparable to a credit card.
@_date: 2019-01-16 19:32:38
With a market cap of currently ONLY 63 billion USD, it doesn't sound crazy. Suppose BTC is priced at 5k at the next block halving. This means the market cap will be around 91.8 billion, not much more than the current market cap. If adoption grows, price naturally goes up to compensate for the limited supply.
I say the market cap is small because there are single companies with a much greater market cap, and BTC is a currency. A little before the ATH, BTC has seen a market cap greater than that of Visa, for example.
@_date: 2019-01-25 02:22:21
No, I'm not talking about a magic number. Your arguments are just twisting what I have been saying. Again, what I am saying is: The more supports the bears break the more likely it is for a turnover. This is not emotional reasoning. The lower the price is at the fewer people will want to sell it. Ok, there might be those who gave up on BTC and just think it will continue falling endlessly, and will sell at a loss. But the more this continues the less people will have that kind of reasoning or will profit from selling. The inverse is also true. I am not being emotional. I am not analyzing history, I am not analyzing facts, I am just using logic. It may still fall further - yes. But it's more likely for it to stop now than when we were at $6k.
@_date: 2019-01-17 00:07:23
Expectations about the immediate future is what I meant. We all would love great news around BTC, we all would love a bull run in 2019. But we shouldn't count on it. Obviously when we hold BTC we ultimately do have expectations, but our eyes should always focus on the long run.

I knew it was likely going to go down. But when you are dealing with bitcoin, the real risk is in selling. If you always hold, you're fine. Just keep adding more.
@_date: 2019-01-11 13:15:26
Suppose bitcoin is dead in 2030. What will be "alive"? LTC, as your name suggests you're a fan of?
@_date: 2019-01-25 02:28:18
It's like I explained in my replies to Wurfless. People don't like to sell at a loss - whales included. You'd only sell at a loss if you were scared it'd go worthless (causing you to lose more money or all your money). The lower the price is at, the less people would profit with selling their BTC. Thus the chance of the bear trend stopping is greater. The inverse is also true, the more the price climbs abnormally, the higher the chance for it to stop climbing, because more and more people will want to sell their BTC in order to consolidate profit, even those who bought high.
@_date: 2019-01-11 01:45:59
I can't say for how much I will sell my BTC, or if I will ever sell my BTC at all. But it won't be at a loss, that's for certain. If it falls to $0, selling at $100 ain't gonna bring me much joy, will it? Though I doubt that's gonna happen.
@_date: 2019-01-25 02:33:05
Bad news has potential to create an exception to that logic, like you've seen with the Bitcoin Cash fork. It has affected cryptocurrency negatively, and I believe it's one of the main causes of the unexpected drop from $6k (a very cemented support nearly no one believed would get breached). People are basically scared now because after the price action we had, they don't feel quite in the mood to buy BTC. Which means that it can take a good while before BTC recovers.
@_date: 2019-01-19 21:49:25
Bitcoin in that sense is pretty much like fiat, supply and demand. If investors buy a lot of dollar, dollar goes up, it's the same rule everywhere.
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:05:06
It's likely we will witness a bounceback, though. Everyone had confidence in the $6k mark, what do you think would happen after a breach? We had a full bear year following a massive pump. This might just be giving the required momentum for the buy-off.
@_date: 2019-01-19 21:50:26

Ever since Bitcoin's inception, people like you have been constantly saying "it's over" with every sharp drop in price. Funny how it doesn't happen. Yes, the price was overhyped last year. And yes - the price corrected, events happened, it dropped further, but believe me, BTC is not going away, it's way too useful to become extinct.
@_date: 2019-01-28 10:59:49
Depends on how long it takes for that to happen.
@_date: 2019-01-30 11:09:45
Difficult, even though the BTC price is known for surprises, the buyer sentiment right now is cautious. At current prices people are comfortable with buying, but head to $4k and you'd start thinking about risk. Purely because of the sharp crash. That feeling is going to prevail for a while, unless 2019 has an ace upon its sleeve (excellent news that boosts sentiment). 
@_date: 2019-01-07 17:16:59

Ever since the year started it has been only sideways action with occasional failed surges. Too early into the year, though. After so sharp a crash, we need something real to create confidence in order to drive prices up. If you have spare cash lying about however, I'd say buy some more.

So disclosing actions that your system may find suspicious is violating a user's privacy, but enforcing KYC isn't? Have you disclosed to the user, privately, the specific reason(s) why your system has flagged their account?

2018 wasn't even the worst year in BTC history. It went through worse in terms of price swings.
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:23:57
Whales drive the price up or down when they sell or buy, but in doing so they're also running risks, as BTC can surge or crash resulting in them having sold low or bought high and lost money. Hodlers are not whales, the more BTC is being held and not used, the less BTC in circulation there will be at any given moment. This is helpful in driving prices up by basic supply vs demand logic, although that won't necessarily happen as there are more factors to it than just that, obviously.
@_date: 2019-01-30 12:20:34
I wouldn't be concerned about price crashes. If they come, so be it. I believe in what the currency stands for and I have the strong feeling it will appreciate in the long run. 
What I can logically state about the present situation is that only a buyer under $3.4k can profit by selling now. Similarly only a buyer under $3k can profit by bringing it down there. And I strongly believe someone who is at a loss and has not sold by now would hardly do so from now on. Hope my two cents helped.
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:35:01
True, it wouldn't be many. Which is why I believe the lower it drops, the harder it is for it to continue dropping, it's likely only a major bad news would have the strength to drive price further down.

If you haven't sold, you've kept your head. :P
@_date: 2019-01-24 17:50:30
That sentence is just another fallacy, by logic I can say the higher an asset surges to, the less likely it is for the surge to continue, and the inverse applies. Because potential buyers/sellers are finite. The more is bought the less people will want to buy (price is high), the more is sold the less people will want to sell (price is low). Only FOMO and the belief an asset will fully crash are exceptions to that.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:42:46
Except that if it goes to that, you won't buy back because you'll be scared of it going to $0.
@_date: 2018-11-17 22:11:36
Losing the $6k support was in fact very damaging to bitcoin's price action. But if you buy a volatile asset like BTC, you should \*never\* care about the price action. You should care about keeping the asset in your pocket. It's a long term contract you're joining here. You believe in the technology, you believe in the revolution.
With that said, the lower it falls the less likely it is for it to fall further. Even though we lost that key support that kept us bottomed for the entirety of 2018, I can say that the risk of missing an opportunity of a great purchase is greater than the risk of you losing money at this point.

Though you will need to think about where you'll store the coins, once you get a substantial amount in Bitcoin. An always offline computer/laptop with an offline wallet is great for this role, it does the same thing as a hardware wallet. Just ensure the computer is completely unable to connect to the internet. To spend your coins, sign a transaction on the offline computer and submit it using an online computer.
@_date: 2019-01-16 19:15:54
I am convinced it will end on a more positive note than 2018. But we shouldn't really create expectations.
@_date: 2019-04-25 19:20:08
It already is a currency, just a volatile one. Which makes it unsuitable for the general consumer.
@_date: 2019-04-11 21:59:25
My analysis is the following, we had an impressive spike on April 1st, the resistance turned support has sustained for a considerable amount of time already, it climbed further.
Today (or yesterday, depending on your time zone) we had a whale selling and great volume, this support was tested and so far it has held again. 
So you can infer that if this support withstands this second test for a while longer, we're off to at least a test of $6k.
@_date: 2019-01-27 23:58:22
That's about what I expect for this year. I don't see a rapid recovery after such a turn of events.
@_date: 2018-11-17 22:14:10
Worth saying that very few people ever dealt with bitcoin or any cryptocurrency, if you compare it to the entire population. Bull potential is still out there in the wild.
@_date: 2019-01-25 11:12:03
Yes it can easily go down. I never said it won't. I won't repeat myself. I have been following the BTC price for five years now.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:02:43
Just out of curiosity, how many bitcoin you guys here are holding?
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:54:43
What you're gonna do if the price falls? You're gonna keep holding, because you've lost too much so it won't really matter or be a good option, if you are smart. 
The only losers are the quitters. Think of the guys who bought at 19k. Would they sell now? If they are sane, no, they would not. So the price going further down doesn't matter to them. They shall hold. 
Only desperate people are selling now, speculators run way too much risk in selling this low.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:25:02
Blame it on the whales.

Exactly. Does nobody here remember that dip much like this one when bitcoin went all the way down to 5.3k? And right after that the 10k+ rally came. You can't really even say bitcoin has ever been worth over 10k, because it never stood above that for a very long time! It only lost its recent meteoric gains. This is excellent news to me, as it has not fallen down to the starting point of the big rally.

Like I had foreseen, after so convincing a $6k breach we had every reason for an extended rally. Near-$7k levels produced a bounceback merely for triggering stop buys. We will likely see more tests of that mark soon, it's a very aggressive bullish case courtesy of that breach (you'd have thought $6k would take a long time for bulls to pass through, but that was not the case, so market is optimistic)

I don't think we can really look at Bitcoin like we would look at the growth of some stock. It's a different universe, labeling it "organic" or "abnormal", is wrong all the same, in my opinion. It's uniquely volatile and it's doing what it does, being volatile. This would be the "normal state" for Bitcoin, although I wouldn't call it "organic".
@_date: 2019-05-13 01:38:19

@_date: 2019-05-13 12:41:09
Just think about it. If you sold now, and a week from now BTC jumped up to $9000, how would you feel? The answer to that question is critical to your decision.
@_date: 2019-05-18 02:27:08
Most importantly of all, you need to be calm. Don't get excited or stressed over the price. Plan your strategy. It depends on what you believe fits your profile. You can be a **trader** and just try to make a profit on price swings. For that you need to study trading. You can be **mixed** and always keep some bitcoin in a separate place you never touch, and another chunk that you use to speculate. You can also be a **full hodler** and basically only buy more coins, never sell them, until they reach a price you're satisfied with, or **not at all**.
If you're planning to sell some of your coins, look out for crazy price spikes (like the last 8 days), with BTC going up $1000 in a matter of 24-48 hours. Read about possible reasons for the spike. If you feel like the price could go back down at any second, that's a great moment to sell some. Of course, you run the risk of BTC just going further up (and never getting back to your sell price), but with such anomalous spikes, the odds are that a correction will happen.
You'd want to buy coins when the exact opposite happens, when the price goes down to a level you **feel is quite cheap**. If you feel it's cheap, it probably is, so snag those satoshis!

There is a lot of sentimental value to the $6k-$7k range, expect this region to be tough like a brick wall.

You have to have a hot wallet to run an exchange or any other service that stores other people's cryptocurrencies. Otherwise payments will have to be manually performed all the time. One thing you can do is flag for review withdrawals exceeding a threshold, or requests coming from a country/city different than the one the account was created in, although that will create a lag for legitimate users and will get people out of the platform.

About the saying that "Bitcoin has been declared dead thousands of times", it's simply a count of all the times an influential person in the media or the financial universe has made negative comments about Bitcoin, e.g. "**Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme**", "**Bitcoin is worthless**", etc. There are a lot of factual counterarguments to such claims that have been explained thoroughly by cryptocurrency bloggers and other enthusiasts.

New blood sure isn't used to this price action. Extreme volatility like this can bring BTC up $1000 or down $1000 (and even greater ranges) within a 24h span. Usually you don't want to trade during this period, unless you're looking for risk.

Personally I would choose neither, I'd only have sex with someone I have affection toward, but from a logical point of view I'd answer "the former".

That recent one from Buffett is absolutely ridiculous, comparing BTC to a button in his jacket. That's so cheap it's not even worth an entry on that site.

You already sold it for free if you use a cryptocurrency exchange.

I doubt it's impossible for the hackers to get away with it. They could, for example, exchange them in the deep web for vouchers, e.g. you send me a voucher for 1 BTC (clean) and I send you 2 BTC (tainted). The buyer runs a risk because they'll have to get rid of the coins, but they could spend it online or whatever. The hackers run no risk because nobody, not even the buyer, will know their identity from that transaction. I wonder if it's possible to, in the future, implement some sort of blacklist that would cause the network to simply refuse transactions trying to spend marked coins (somebody must have thought of this already).  
As for Binance, they have a fund which backed their hot wallet, so that's already settled.

It would be pretty horrible if you bought at $400k :P
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:05:27
My question to you is, if you were an organization holding a hundred million dollars in bitcoin, would you sell right now?
@_date: 2019-05-11 12:57:59
If you feel like doing that, you can separate your coins in two stashes, your speculation stash and your storage stash. When the price reaches a major hurdle, you sell a part of the speculation stash. Whenever there is a dip in price (and if at all), you buy back what you sold and put the profit on the storage stash. You never touch the storage stash, unless the price continues to go up and you could not buy back an earlier sale. In that case you take another piece of the storage and move it to the speculation stash at the next major hurdle. But try not going under 50% of what it started with, no matter how high BTC goes.
@_date: 2018-12-19 20:58:15
It's going to take a while because a lot of people bought bitcoin at &gt; $10k. A LOT. Some bought even what they couldn't afford to. People with zero investing experience. They just saw the news headlines and FOMO'd in. And it's not too hard to hypothesize that a good portion of those people have not yet exited or only partially exited at a loss. What we witnessed this year was the reverse of last year, FOMO replaced by FUD. When the market starts to recover, it will be met by floods of people exiting, so we're looking at quite some time here.

If you bought anywhere near current prices, you've got a bargain, so chill.

I could literally just sit looking at a real time chart eating popcorn like I would watch a movie, right now.
@_date: 2019-05-10 00:08:52
I was thinking of a pullback after multiple $6k tests. $6k is the tough mark, remember that it was the bottom for the bulls during a good chunk of 2018. With BTC having held through that mark, I wouldn't be surprised if it rocketed further.  
Obviously it's going to pullback at some point, even if it rockets.
@_date: 2018-12-10 10:48:09
If you believe in the asset you invested in, selling low is never the answer.
@_date: 2018-12-12 11:48:06
For example, not buying at this price is a missed opportunity, kids.

For the general consumer, BTC is not a suitable currency (can it ever stop being volatile?). Stablecoins were conceived to solve this problem, however they rely on fiat (with a few dubious exceptions), which defeats the point.

It could happen by christmas, it typically rallies close to the end of the year.
@_date: 2019-05-10 00:12:45
I am certainly happy with the BTC movement, but I wouldn't call this "altcoins are fading". This is just speculation from alt holders to get more coins.
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:15:06
as well as fiat is used for illicit purchases :D

You are wrong, there's a 100% chance they are full of shit.

Early adopter price is like $1000 and under (last year bitcoin was so divulged that most people you ask around at least know it exists). We're quite close to that. So buying now makes you practically an early adopter, even if it's just in terms of buy price.

Not that tough, my friend.

Bitcoin has always been bad news resistant, so the fact that it's rallying despite the Binance hack does not surprise me in the slightest. I'd say the pump is purely from optimism originated from multiple confirmations of a long term bull trend.
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:55:30
I have a long-term memory and I remember when I bought my first fraction at $60/BTC. Good ol' times.

Take a look at the charts and say that again. This is not even the worst bear season for BTC.
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:03:58
I also think that. Bitcoin being this low is a great opportunity to buy, actually. I was buying at $6k, though, so felt kinda bad (could've gotten it half off that!)
@_date: 2018-12-01 23:36:29
Do you really believe we're going to lose our money if we never sell? Do you believe we are headed to zero, honestly? It just doesn't make sense. All the investment going into cryptocurrencies is just crazy, you see.
@_date: 2018-12-21 01:30:06
What else do you expect anyone to do? Money's purpose is to be spent. Bitcoin is a currency. Hodlers see reason for this currency to appreciate over time, and that appreciation will bring them profit. If its design and goals confirm themselves, we won't really see a stop in its appreciation. Naturally you can expect sharp price corrections (as this year's), it's all natural. But a bitcoin won't ever be useful to a hodler until they exchange it for something else of value (just like you can't feed yourself with dollar bills, you need to exchange them for food).
To finish: They will keep their holdings until they feel they've profitted enough, according to their own goals. I advocate never selling everything, practicing something similar to a halvening (e.g. price hits $50k mark, you sell 20% of your holdings, then on the $100k mark, you sell 10% of your remaining holdings, on the $150k mark, you sell 5% of the remainder, and so on. If a sharp dip occurs, you rebuy some if you sold above.)
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:54:31
Wow. Such volatile, very dip.

Last year there was a period when I had the mindset that $9k was a bargain. If you're afraid of it pulling back before you break even at $8k, I can say that the higher it goes in a spike like this, the higher the bear pressure for a pullback will be. So yes, it's very possible we will get a pullback. HOWEVER, you should be VERY optimistic about this price action. It climbed to $6k, that price point was sustained, and then it spiked to $7k, peaked at $7.5k, bounced back to a bit lower than $6.9k and climbed back. **BTC held ground after two consecutive spikes**. So make up your mind.

You could set up some dead man's switch to automatically reveal your recovery phrase if you don't perform a specific action within two years for example.

Implying I hold any, just because I don't think they're fading right now. In fact, it's possible that altcoins will go near worthless someday, because they are not actually used or trusted in a scale comparable to BTC.

Well it's not a requirement that the owners of the bitcoins themselves will have to store the bitcoins. Much the opposite. Mainstream adoption requires extreme ease of use, just like a credit card is today. Either you sign some contract and let a company hold the coins for you, or you hold yourself in a foolproof way which has yet to be devised.
