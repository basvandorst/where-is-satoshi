I personally want both; if just breadwallet had pc suppory.
The issue is I may not be able to use my phone to do stuff with my bits so I can practically use any secure device I own (PC etc) to boot up my wallet and do transactions. One of the reason I am trying to get multiplatform is I have a family thats **VERY** nosy in my private life. If I do something that they dont like or feel comfortable me doing they take the phone etc. I am sorta seeking a detour from them in a way so...
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:17:34
Its the hacker known as 4Chan!
@_date: 2016-08-30 09:43:34
No. I read that from the Guardian. Fuck Turkish Media. They practically suck erdogan's cock. I read more foreign media than locale. Guardian, Reuters, CNN etc.
@_date: 2016-08-29 23:06:15
Cant do cash. Just cant (Sorry)
@_date: 2016-08-25 22:43:10
I was gonna try to convince my parents to buy .050 btc but my only option is gone. I heard there is another site but it wasnt as trusted as BTCTurk cause it was a bit shady.
I couldnt buy before cause they asked for a bank card.
Well rip 0.050 dream...
Downvoted for sharing a real news about bitcoin? Thanks guys.
@_date: 2016-08-29 18:15:25
Its not to save cash.
Like 0.01 of that cash goes to my cold bank. I had 0.04 before this mess and I still have it.
**EDIT** Two dollars? Lmao like 10-15 bucks. And thats practically a lot, when you are a student saving all extra pennies/dollars after sparing cash for btc, food, transport etc while trying to gather a PC up while preping for University.
@_date: 2016-08-16 00:12:53
CoPay is multi sig afaik; and I recall seeing it written on the top of the screen while setting up on my pc.
@_date: 2016-08-29 21:18:21
Thanks to you I found about indacoin.com which is a way for me to buy btc with my debit cards!
@_date: 2016-08-16 13:02:46
I got a windows/linux pc so....
@_date: 2016-08-29 23:47:51
Where can I find more groups?
@_date: 2016-08-30 12:55:03
Can you explain multisig for a noob?
@_date: 2016-08-17 16:47:36
Thank you! Feel free to join abroad!
@_date: 2016-08-30 20:57:39
Huh? What and how?
@_date: 2016-08-29 18:54:45
I dont use telegram :/
ISIS does lmao :P
Just kidding, may try telegram out but not sure what will they suggest. Thanks for the link though.
@_date: 2016-08-30 15:34:23
I use copay but I cant do that?
I have a spending password though...
Also how can I encrypt the wallet? Like I think I saw it in the settings somewhere?
@_date: 2016-08-30 09:42:40
Debit card.
I dont have time to go out except for academical shit. Thats why I cant do cash.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:13:13
Yea, reporting someone for having other views than you.
So mods way; instead of reporting, just banning them right away.
Thats why only has memes at their top. Hardly any quality chatter regarding Bitcoin itself.
Good job.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:18:48
Yea because Bitcoin wasn’t made to spend. Have you even read the whitepaper? Then what is the difference between BTC and gold? Just to hold and wait for the value to increase?
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:56:21
“1000 USD USD”
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:27:26
Maybe due to them being involved in getting raided?
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:24:52
Because the mods allow shit talking to BCH, but disallow critisizm of BTC and its broken aspects like the high fees, slow transaction times.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:12:49
XRP is made by banks for banks, so don’t trust it
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:45:29
I don’t believe the shit here as majority of the posts are just HODL and nothing else. Like no one is criticizng the high fees, shitload of unconfirmed transactions or the fact that it takes forever to confirm a transaction nowadays.
With a solid proof that “hacked” users and brigade I call an inside job.
Like earlier this week when got raided and had “Bcash is a scam” on header/title, and redirected users to I saw IP logs of the compromised mod acc; a different IP that was used to login and alter @_date: 2017-02-23 14:49:58
I did recover my wallet to my chrome web browser a week or two ago. But my wallet originates from my mobile. Should I stop using it on the browser?
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:18:34
Mind ELI5 to a non-genius? I use BTC to escape the Turkish economy and I aint too intimate with the technicality so
@_date: 2017-02-07 05:11:52
For those who are curious about the TXID etc: 
I sent 0.005 BTC
@_date: 2017-02-18 13:26:55
Having a "forex" or an "investment" site set up on facebook with the oldest bitcoin scam copy-pasta
Legit as fuck.
@_date: 2017-02-07 00:41:55
How do I fond out? I didn't make the transaction cause the fee is too damn high imo
@_date: 2017-02-12 14:20:35
Hey its me, your 30 year old son.
@_date: 2017-02-07 04:19:59
You kidding me right?
@_date: 2017-02-23 09:43:23
I use CoPay so how does this affect me? ELI5 please.
@_date: 2017-02-23 15:51:12
The chrome extension.
@_date: 2017-02-06 23:56:32
Input output?
What do you mean with that?
@_date: 2017-02-23 10:37:02
I use the normal addresses generated for months now. Received and sent with no issue since August. Should I be worried and receive from older addresses?
@_date: 2017-02-10 19:58:11
Didn't circle stop selling btc?
@_date: 2017-02-07 05:11:30
I did the transaction:
@_date: 2016-06-15 10:49:29
Welp I will spare every single penny I got and wait till I got 10 USD (30 TL) and deposit it all to OPSKINS and withdraw it as bitcoins. Thats the only way I got.
@_date: 2016-06-10 15:58:19
* How secure is it? It aint a scam right?
* If its real how long do I have to keep my 0.024 btc there to earn intrest and whats rhe intrest? 
* Can I withdraw anytime?
* How does it work?
@_date: 2016-06-10 17:17:38
How does that work and can I do it in Turkey?
@_date: 2016-06-15 06:11:46
They do but its in TL and not in USD.
D&amp;R, Teknosa sells em, not sure about Vatan
@_date: 2016-06-11 06:17:07
So fuckin helpful! /s
Please read the other guys replies man...
@_date: 2016-06-11 06:16:40
@_date: 2016-06-10 11:33:55
I am gambling on a faucet site to somehow magically make 2 BTC (I know, its silly but I am 17 and I cant find jobs cause I am under 18 but the government allows to be employed after the age of 16) I am trying to get to 2 BTC to build myself a gaming PC that would cost around 4K /1.5K USD. I have 1/3 of the cash in my little wooden "bank.'
I tend to try to deposit my profits on my bank (right now its at 0) which is either my secondary account or my wallet.
@_date: 2016-06-12 15:30:27
As a Turk: is this the genuine Baklava from Turkey? Like the taste, smell and such; is it similiar to the ones I eat or....?
@_date: 2016-06-13 04:23:15
Migros, Macro Center, Vatan Computer, Teknosa, D&amp;R
@_date: 2016-06-10 14:23:03
I am already using it. Read the post properly please.
@_date: 2016-06-10 17:34:39
I know about OPSkins. The issue is 10 USD is nearly 30 TL and its a bit a lot. I will try to do skin based shit though since I play CSGO and TF2.
Guess those 2 will be my salvation.
@_date: 2016-06-13 05:55:34
Correct me if I am wrong but isnt that the lifetime package? (Gold)
I mean I am planning to spend my 0.05 BTC there if I believe its worthy; since 2 USD nearly makes 6 TL or so; so within a week I will have 42 TL (Half of what I have atm)
I am planning to build a gaming pc next year so this might be a good way to evaluate my BTC since after August I wont be able to do anything other than work.
@_date: 2016-06-12 15:31:41
Did you rescan your blockchain?
@_date: 2016-06-10 16:43:36
My mother is a against me even workin with money.
My "friends" who use me like I am like nothing are not older than 17 and wont even help me with anything. So I am stuck with 0,024 btc I got; with a goal of achieving 2 BTC.
@_date: 2016-06-13 09:53:25
Its personal experience. How is it possible to lose 10 times in a row with a 1.1x multiplier (90% win chance)
@_date: 2016-06-10 15:24:37
I was told about Cold Storing. ELI5? And how can I do it?
@_date: 2016-06-10 11:03:47
But wouldnt the fees be an issue?
Also I can run CoPay on my iPhone, iPad and Windows PC at the same time without making 3 accounts right?
@_date: 2016-06-10 13:46:05
I saw it.
Well I want to ask: shall I use Breadwallet to take in mu funds then transfer them to CoPay; similar to you?
@_date: 2016-06-10 18:02:38
Ah well. OPSkins and such will be my salvation then. Thank you all!
@_date: 2016-06-23 06:42:07
Will we ever get a pc version to connect all my 3 devices? Or do I still have to use CoPay?
@_date: 2016-06-10 12:05:17
Yea. Really hard. Thats why I started BTC but I cant find sellers who wont accept my debit card (Mastercard Debit (Ininal)) They all want a bank transaction and since I am 17 I cant buy 20 TL (0.015ish) BTC properly.
@_date: 2016-06-29 23:43:09
What is BIP75?
@_date: 2016-06-10 15:47:50
As I said I cant buy from BTCTurk cause they want a bank account and I dont have cause I am 17.
If you come to Istanbul, ping me and I can give you a visit guide!
@_date: 2016-06-10 17:33:02
Welp amazon does not exist in Turkey so... Dunno if it would work?
@_date: 2016-06-11 08:14:59
How does it work? ELI5?
@_date: 2016-06-13 04:49:23
May I ask what did you buy from them and how much did they pay? I mean I trust Genesis more than others so...
@_date: 2016-06-10 15:30:47
@_date: 2016-06-10 17:16:12
Because a rig costs more than 3-4K and with the price of TL/USD rising its better to use BTC and since BTC is only related to USD its a salvation from the shitty turkish economy.
@_date: 2016-06-10 20:58:57
I check the sites that claim to double/triple etc your investment because they might be obvious scams (which they are)
I hope BTC will reach 600-650 USD this weekend and I may sell em?
@_date: 2016-06-10 10:22:44
Any ETA on iOS?
@_date: 2016-06-10 16:31:02
Unfortunetly I dont. I am planning to be a software engineer so maybe after 1-2 years lol. The only job that was available was a translation to Turkish (Native Turkish speaker here) but it was already completed :(
@_date: 2016-06-10 10:49:30
What are the chances of such an event?
@_date: 2016-06-10 15:49:24
I can make a website but I dont have my laptop for a short while and dont know how will I make a site like that; like what would it be its content and such.
@_date: 2016-06-10 17:17:04
How do I do that?
@_date: 2016-06-10 16:24:35
I wont be able to maintain if after August due to university preps - Till next year July. So it aint a good idea for short term :/
@_date: 2016-06-07 18:09:35
As a lego fan but broke as fuck: have [this](
@_date: 2016-06-10 10:22:13
I've seen it but Bitcoin.org says centralized validation so I got no idea what it is.
I also want to control my wallet on 3 different platforms as I said and Airbitz doesnt do that I suppose?
@_date: 2016-06-12 15:42:36
Basically its a rescan
I got the option to rescan the blockchain on my Breadwallet. I didnt try your wallet so I may not assist too well but mess with the settings and try to find rescan option.
@_date: 2016-06-12 19:35:56
No problem! I had a similiar issue once so...
@_date: 2016-06-10 17:16:59
Well I lived in Egypt and Turkey for a total of 8 years now. These people whom I call friends have always used me for their own benefit while I never did such a thing. Shit just wont change in a day friend; since it has been the same for 8 years.
@_date: 2016-06-10 12:11:49
I just made a copay and saw that a transaction fee is like 0,0001-0.0004
Its a bit high versus the others eh?
@_date: 2016-06-10 16:23:18
The issue is I cant buy because
1) Started BTC cause Paypal ceased their works in Turkey (This was one of my main reasons)
2) I am a 11th grade student. Next year at 12th grade I wont have time o check reddit due to university exams. I have my last days as a free man numbered: till August so after that I will place my BTC in a cold bank. I want to make some BTC and just save it.
@_date: 2016-06-13 06:47:58
As a person who played on Primedice: dont. Its really, really rigged. Seeds are shit; all of them make you lose em all; even with a 90% win chance.
I'd say try bustabit; I depositted 3500 bits and withdrew 21000 bits.
@_date: 2016-06-10 21:12:33
No one is selling bitcoins for cash in Istanbul. All bank transfers. If there was cash, I'd go with cash.
@_date: 2016-06-10 11:15:55
I need this in Turkey lol
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:17:43
This doesnt explain the current drop tho.
@_date: 2016-06-13 09:52:32
And since its lifetime would you say its a worthy investment?
@_date: 2017-01-20 15:32:52
I started recently; I deposited 0.0185 btc, made something like 0.0015 btc in a week, which is nice.
I dont see any loss?
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:11:50
Thank you! I will be PM'in boh of you!
@_date: 2016-06-09 15:32:54
Thats too kind of you!
If someone is willing to do this I can DM you two then.
@_date: 2016-06-10 18:02:08
I wont purchase the PC now. I am trying to spare as much as cash I can till next year WHEN I WILL BUILD MY PC.
It my fault that I didnt clarify the date. It will be mext year July 2017 when I will build my PC; WHEN I GRADUATE. Sorry for the lack of info. I would love to build it this year but my mother and aunt oppose it.
And PS: I was given 0.024 from few generous people a day or so ago so I aint here to get tips. I am not asking for them. I am asking how can I grow my current funds. I aint a beggar; I aint poor and I aint homeless and shit so....
You and your bullshit is full of shit unfortunately.
@_date: 2016-06-12 23:20:04
17 with 0.05.
Trying to teach Turks but they wont listen. Classic us.
@_date: 2016-06-13 04:22:25
My goal is 2 :P
@_date: 2016-06-10 14:24:32
Thats why I will keep my money both on my PC, Tablet and Phone; on CoPay.
Using Breadwallet to verify my transactions then sending them to CoPay (As a small plan)
@_date: 2016-06-10 10:40:04
That seems a good option. I will look it up then reply again.
What is centralized validation?
@_date: 2016-12-25 22:55:43
What app is that?
@_date: 2016-06-12 15:41:27
I lived in Egypt for 5 years.
I would say you are making a mistake :P
But hey: if it sells, keep it. If not; try the Turkish one.
And try Lokum :P
@_date: 2016-12-25 12:01:59
Its a bit personal, sorry. But if you want financial ones: I lost .2 to two scammers (total .2) when I first started BTC. .2 is like a lot in Turkish Lira (Well for me, since I am a student) so...
@_date: 2016-11-19 14:43:30
He did type the address right, I checked it.
@_date: 2016-12-25 10:26:19
Unfortunately our lives are full of regrets and "I wish"'es.
This one is your I wish OP. There will be plenty more unfortunately. I have a share of these I wish'es aswell.
@_date: 2016-12-25 22:52:59
Uhm any transactions? I mean you have to contact BitPay, but if the bits/btc was sent: rip you.
Also why not make a thread but bump a 3 month old thread that has nothing to do with your topic?
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:18:31
More money than I’ll ever have in my life.
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:43:28
My parent planned her debt etc, so it aint a big issue.
Issue is that sooner she pays it off, better for her; as the Turkish economy is shitting down the drain; USD rising to 4, Euro to 5 so...
The issue was BTC wasn’t this volatile in Aug. it rose then dipped etc. and now its rising nonstop; but why?
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:06:59
True. No debt is the way to go :)
I am trying to convince her to buy 260 liras worth of BTC instead of gold; as it can pay out more in the long or short term.
BTC even made it to the newspapers and news here so... except the newspapers wrote it wrong saying Bitmoney etc.
I am thinking of making some portfolios with the BCH and investing some on exchanges. I got like 0.01 BTC so I might also put that into use...
@_date: 2017-04-12 20:57:10
I need one asap, I would appreciate it. If you got discord; join discord.me/r-bitcoin (BashCo is there aswell but its the unoffical discord) or you can PM me here and we can sort a way.
@_date: 2016-09-10 10:12:11
Does it work with debit cards?
@_date: 2016-10-05 13:28:42
Alright thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:32:58
My mother does
She doesnt even know I use bitcoins or even made 0.035 to 1 BTC lmao. She'd think I spent my my money on em even tho I didnt.
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:16:51
I know that but I am in Turkey :(
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:57:07
That would be risky.
Would be selling around 7-8K TRY (3K USD) in cash. And if you consider how fucked up Turkey is I can either be killed by druggies or the buyer.
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:52:46
I can't have a bank account because I do not have an income (18, High School Senior) so the law wont let me.
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:35:22
Not as far as I know.
Even if they did; customs and shit.
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:34:55
Tried gambling. Quit after a bit. Didn't make it to 1 BTC by gambling.
Did lending and shit
@_date: 2016-07-03 23:52:57
Can I buy coins from coinbase with turkish lira with my mastercard debit?
I want to buy 0.02 but I am unlucky atm
@_date: 2016-07-04 12:57:29
How does that work?
Do they accept debit cards? I am 17 so....
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:11:58
Any proof of past trades, rep etc?
@_date: 2017-06-05 09:36:14
Issue is I live in Turkey.
There is an 18% tax. My 1800 EU shopping will cost me 300 EU extra, but still be worth more than buying the pc parts from local stores as I will be saving a lot of Turkish Lira.
I prefer to do it by myself, not rely on strangers.
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:19:27
If there will be two roads, what will happen to the price?
I assume it will be like ETH and ETHC, but I don't know their prices etc.
@_date: 2017-06-05 08:16:18
Can anyone verify if that site legit? First time I heard of it. Heard of Purse.io and Gyft but they don't have amazon.de so I posted this selfpost. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 23:09:48
Breadwallet is coming to Android soon.
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:19:44
Will do. Have my doubts abiut
