"A french interview with Anna Karpeles, mother of Mark Karpeles, reveals that Mark was under investigation for computer fraud when he left France for Japan." 
Mark had experience stealing people's money? o.o

I don't know the full details but money transmitter license is different in each state. Some states are a bit easier to get it approved for bitcoin atm and some states are harder (example: NY)

"We will be closely monitoring the situation" means that we are doing nothing.

The thing is that they aren't actually dead, yet. They are clinging to whatever lifesuppport there is. If they die than price will probably drop again.

Such a huge stepping stone for bitcoin. Someone needs to shoot Karpeles.

Time to hunt Karpeles down.

At least they do get something back compared to nothing.

Mark has lied many times already, whatever he says now doesn't really help.

Does Karpeles believe that this is considered a official announcement....
