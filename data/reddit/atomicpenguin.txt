Well, the SMS code was another factor.  I don't take issue with them doing a vein scan.
I think the bigger issue is that the vein scan is not really explained in the UI, which made the OP ask, "WTF how is this anonymous?"  Here the problems are explained in plain English on Reddit, and that doesn't really help Joe Sixpack down at the local watering hole when he is trying to use the kiosk.

I used [VirWox]( in the past to buy Linden with  a Visa rebate card, then exchanged the Linden for BTC on VirWox.
It looks like they've disabled BTC withdrawals for the moment too, though.  Its a fairly easy to use site.  But you shouldn't expect to be able to withdraw BTC from their site, for probably the next week.

Was the purpose of the palm-vein scan as a dual-factor authentication method communicated in the user interface?  Were any alternative dual-factor authentication methods offered?

You made $2 net profit on every $1.  Others have said, "you'll never see X-range prices again", before the last price crash.
If the market price drops, you will still have triple the value you put in.  If the market continues to rise, the only thing you will have lost is maybe half a percent in transaction fees, buying back in.
If and when you buy back in with more dollars for fewer BTC, you will still be ahead in actual value from where you started.  It isn't like you are throwing your money away at the casino.

Found another bug with the printOrder code.  Steps to re-produce:
1. Put in a low bid, or high ask order that will not clear for a long time.
2. Run Redbit in live mode, bug is not reproducible in simulation mode.
3. Redbit crashes when trying to print open orders.  It looks to me like there is an input error trying to run a [string oid (12345678-9abc-def0--0123456789ab) through int()](

coinlab is not the same as coinbase.

It occasionally crashes (exits) for me.  Don't know if it is a MtGox API lag issue, or a code issue.  Is there any way to make the code auto-retry an API connection given the refresh data rate?
Besides wrapping it in a "while true" bash loop which could lead to buy/sell orders exceeding funds (or available BTC)?

Not really against the TOS. However, exchanging money for games is discouraged by Valve. I think the reason they discourage this, is mostly because it is one of the most common forms of trade scamming (e.g. transfer money; trade item; chargeback for refund).
Whether Valve go after something like steambits for using the Steam trademark is another matter.

You do understand there is a difference between *[round numbers]( and a *[decimal base]( counting system, right?  Because I keep seeing folks in here throw around this *base* term used in the wrong sense of the term.

Last thing I see before it fails is ["Buying 0.0 BTC for XX USD each (total = 0.0 USD)"](
Perhaps it could be crashing because it is failing to check whether their are funds to actually buy with?

Right, because we all know you can't find illegal drugs in schools, even when you have cash on hand.
Especially since BTC is just as liquid as cash, and so readily available.  I mean its just so easy for a teenager to get their cash to a BTC exchange.  Then all you have to do is trade in your BTC for drugs on the Silk Road through TOR.  Then risk having their parents find the drugs when its mailed to the house.  Yeah, its not like they can **get drugs at school with cash**.  Damn, this BTC is just so convenient for those troublemaking kids involved in illicit activity like the drug trade, which totally doesn't go down at school on a cash basis.

So, I create an issue and deposit some coin, and nobody fixes the attached issue for some time.  If I go back later and fix the issue myself, and close the issue without a PR (pull request), what happens to my BTC?

Maybe not, if you're buy threshold is below the going rate.  I still think this is a bug which would spam the API with empty buy orders (even if they don't go through).  If you add guards for buys/sells making sure it is not zero-balance, it wouldn't be an issue.  Otherwise, the `canBuy` or `canSell` definitions will return true, and the script will hit the API buy/sell URLs with invalid orders.

    def canBuy(self, btc, usd):
    - return self.getUSD() &gt;= (btc * usd)
    + return self.getUSD() &gt;= (btc * usd) and self.getUSD() != 0
