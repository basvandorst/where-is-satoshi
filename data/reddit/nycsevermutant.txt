No idiot you answer me this, has email killed USPS? No it has not, this article is bullshit. Email has allowed to SKIP a mail infrastructure in POOR countries that couldn't afford it in the first place, like South America, Chile, Argentina, tiara del fuego rigeon has NEVER seen a land line phone because it would be expensive, so the people had to wait for cellphones. Rich countries have had both.
Nobody is pointing a gun to pay for any service, if USPS was closed there would be a nationwide outrage and chaos, Google some of the functions of USPS, then google why do countries need a government ran postal office. It keeps the monopoly in check doesn't allow USPS and FedEx raise prices too high, it also gives people a trusted way to send parcels. How else would you otherwise send physical checks, this isn't fucking asia where you use wechat letting Chinese communists pry into your finances.

You are delusional, it's very easy to check how much money USPS has made, I suggest  you do that before shitposting. USPS works directly with FedEx and UPS and often times delivers packages for them, FedEx also rents USPS trucks sometimes. They all share airplanes too, because it's cheaper for them. Also USPS handles passports and you can call them and opt-out of junk mail. Simple phone call.

Pretty sure post office in the US is doing better than ever.

Are you pedaling a notion that European/Asian lifestyle where the lack of infrastructure is somehow being perceived as progress? Everyone in the US is still sending letters, not to each other obviously, but for billing, documents, USPS also handles parcel shipping, get a clue man.
