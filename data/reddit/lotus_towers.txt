Idk man, he has more spine that Obama, already I like him more than the last guy. Atleast he doesnt take shit from shithole regimes like China CCP and Iran. Hate all you want, Trump will probably win 2020 with all the salt you libs keep spewing.

I was originally hoping for Bernie, but after Hillary pulled her establishment strings and fucked it up for the rest of us after the DNC primaries, I was pissed off enough to vote for Trump. And tbh, I rather Trump than Hillary because at least Trump doesnt have two faces, unlike Obama and Hillary. I rather it be an honest face, even if I dislike the hell out of it.

Lets not forget, this is the country that also is the most innovative for it's aerospace, computer, medical, pharmaceutical, Chemical, industrial, energy and transportation technologies and achievements. But let's keep assuming that America is "insolvent" right? Like the rest of the world does not leech off America's innovations and all the money they have poured into organizations like NASA , DARPA, DEA, who have contributed much to mankind? And not just that, but also make many of these technologies AVAILABLE to the rest of the world (example is Agricultural Revolution by Norman Borlaugh or NASA's NTRS server that China regularly hacks into). All the debt they poured, so that other countries can benefit and progress technologically?
No, lets just ignore America's achievements and talk about their problems. Let's glorify Europe, China and India taking america's innovations granted and for themselves.

I'm sure you will continue to struggle to believe it when Trump wins again in 2020.

No offence but youre full of crock. The USA is still the most innovative nation on the Earth, other countries dont even come close. Asian countries are growing, but are still nowhere near the level of the USA ���� (haters gonna hate).

You're still salty about why Trump won, is why he will probably win 2020 again. You think this country runs on popular votes? Our founding father deliberately put those systems in place to prevent dictatorships, so that populists leaders dont consolidate too much power (see Hitler, Mussolini, Erdogan, and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine).

If you seriously think Trump is the "worst thing" that has happened, you need to go back to school and read some history. There are countries out there with far more fucked leaders than Trump (Putin, Xi, Modi, Duerte, Salman etc)
Fyi: I voted Obama, but I voted Trump just to piss off you liberals, who I now very much despise along with the right. Trump did promise to take down the Big Banks so lets see if that happens, Ive more confidence in him than pro-bank pro-eatablishment Hillary Clinton who still lost despite all the media support.

Nah, that's just salty liberal minded thinking (I would know since I used to hang around liberals a lot until I left their circles completely). FYI, I am not white, And I know that if you wanna claim Trump is racist, you might as well say everyone on this earth is a racist.
I dont exactly like Trump but I will admit that he doesnt exactly place two-faced games and doesnt bendover the most powerful democracy on this Earth to other shithole repressive countries like the previous POTUS Obama did.
