My idea is that a bitcoin, by virtue of being used more often for larger transactions, derives a higher monetary value, which I label as "intrinsic value." I'm not debating the definition of value as this is targeted towards the financial services industry, which would contextually make it a proper use of the term. How would you label it?

I wouldn't say that the electricity &amp; R&amp;D gives Bitcoin value, but Bitcoin gives them value. 
I agree that network size and hashing power would have value, but I think that those would be reflected in transaction volumes in the long run.

The chart isn't mine, it was an example of poor valuation methodologies.

I meant more so in the sense that people use electricity and conduct R&amp;D because bitcoin grows in value, but their use does not increase the value of a bitcoin.

Chart shows a spurious correlation that couldn't hold up.

Agree with you completely and I've talked about modifying supply before but for the sake of this article I kept the assumptions simpler vs. doubling the length and making it even more boring than it already was as an econ lesson. If you remove coins from the supply, you'd also have to modify the velocity, which would now increase in multiples as well.
The overall message was that people shouldn't be calling bottoms and basing business decisions based on charts and dreams and the numbers were just an example of how there's still significant downside potential. I'll definitely make sure I that make future posts more clear, still getting used to writing. Thanks for the feedback!

Fiat currencies are subject to political risks, which is one of the main reasons for the adoption of the bitcoin. The bubbles are going to continue for a while but will stabilize with enough time.
