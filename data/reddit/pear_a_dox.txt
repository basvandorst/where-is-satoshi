okay so lets get this straight- fiat is worthless- even though it still works even without power; however bitcoin is king, even though it is absolutely useless once society collapses?   
im all for ending un-checked capitalism, but anyone who believes that a virtual currency is ging to replace fiat  currency better be ready to fight every major developed nation in the world.  The federal banking system and the IMF would have a field day with those who would want to challenge them. like it or not, that's the fact.   
just ask china and russia how it went for them. massive inflation and massive inflation. Turns out you cant ust ignore the world market and expect other countries to still value your currency.  
Bitcoin's only use is money laundering. to many people with a poor understanding of how the world financial system works just thinks we can use bitcoin and call it a day. Last time i check MT.GOX fucked over basically everyone after they got hacked. Goodluck with that system.

nonononononono  


 Just as Netflix demolished Blockbuster, et al, and Amazon demolished Sears,
Sears collapsed because eddie lampert bought controlling interest with a hedge fund, leveraged his debts into the profitable company, took out more loans for his other ventures, and otherwise used it as his piggy bank.  He ended up selling craftsmen and other brands for extra money and is now seeking the properties in liquidation,   
sears failed because market regulation is abysmal and american companies hold more value than persons.

So tell me how exactly do you use Bitcoin when you don't have any Internet infrastructure around. No power no Bitcoin. Pretty basic flaw in the problem.

no seriously, i want to know what type of bullshit you view on youtube. i see this all day- you have no idea how the world financial market works. i might not be an expert but im not ignorant to how it works. You should try learning how we got here and give some suggestions to fix the problem- i can promise you that the "collapse the system" option you seem to be longing for will only allow the "elite" (read-those with resources at their disposal) will wipe the floor with everyone else. without checks and balances, it would not take much for someone to take control of oil. and once you control the most potent and available energy source on the planet, you own the means of production. sound similar?

question- how well does bitcoin work when the power and internet fail completely?   
bitcoin relies on systems that are paid for by the system it wants to topple.... butcoin RELIES on systems it wants to topple....
