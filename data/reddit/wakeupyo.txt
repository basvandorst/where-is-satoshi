Average person? The average Bitcoin users obviously doesn't understand it either. That's why yet another huge sum of money was just lost
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:25:06
I cannot understand why it takes hack after hack after hack for people to understand storing your Bitcoin on an exchange is not safe.
Why do people keep making the same fucking mistakes over and over? Aren't Bitcoin users suppose to be tech-savvy?
Heck, it's not even about being tech-savvy at this point, it's just basic common sense

How many coins does Satoshi hold? 1.5 MILLION? I don't see much of a difference.
How many coins do people like the Winklevoss twins hold?
The same pattern of a very small % holding a very large % holds true in Bitcoin too it seems

Actually the UK is not on their list of countries for some reason :(

Point is a 3rd party does not tell you who and where you can send the money. I do not have to provide ID when I send Bitcoin to someone. And the fees are close to 0, especially when compared to something like an international bank wire
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:17:53


Oh really? bitstamp.net? coinbase.com? What if tomorrow something happened to those and they went the way of Mt. Gox? Are you saying that wouldn't have a HUGELY negative impact on Bitcoin?


They did and still do.
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:46:24
I assure you my post had absolutely nothing to do with the recent "decreases" in Bitcoin value
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:29:15
Actually gold was around many hundreds of years before fiat currency. There was a time when people did not compare the two.
I take your point though and I'm not necessarily saying comparison is bad. I'm saying it's gone WAY too far and has been turned into some weird stock/gambling platform, rather than a revolutionary form of currency exchange
@_date: 2014-03-27 19:58:09
Okay so maybe 5 big exchangers instead of 3, fair enough.
The point still stands that if any 1 of those went down (which could very easily happen at any time), then Bitcoin would take a huge hit. If 2 or more went down it would be disastrous.
It just seems to me the lessons from Mt. Gox haven't been fully taken on board
@_date: 2014-09-17 07:52:42
How is this anything but bad news for Bitcoin? Or do you seriously believe the majority of normal law abiding citizens would be willing to risk 12 years in jail under money laundering charges just so they could use Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:40:23
Yeah that makes a lot more sense
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:12:05
Wow, so yeah that confirms exactly what I was saying. You have 2 main exchangers controlling the vast majority, followed by 2 or 3 smaller ones taking the rest
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:14:20
The people can use it however they want, it's a free open market (at the moment anyway). I was merely raising points I considered important.
And I really don't think my OP was similar to the melt downs I've seen in this subreddit when prices suddenly drop, but I guess that's your opinion :)
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:06:33
Stolen proves the point even more so
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:25:37
You're talking about money printing and the devaluing that it creates and how Bitcoin cannot just be printed at will.
That's not a testament to it being used well. It just shows how good of a system it is to begin with.
The whole point of my post was illustrating how people seem to have been given this opportunity of a truly revolutionary platform and yet they've decided to misuse it and directly connect it to an old flawed one

I don't develop applications, but yes, I do spend on a regular basis. And I don't pretend Bitcoin is some stock to day trade or "invest" in
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:39:13
Maybe some people did it today for all I know, but on a mass scale? Probably hundreds of years ago.
Like I said the point of the post wasn't to say comparing Bitcoin to $s is evil, it's just the way people have become OBSESSED with the $ price from a "day trading" (gambling) perspective that's ruining it
@_date: 2014-03-27 19:04:36
Yeah I'm still willing to bet the majority of all exchanges are concentrated in the big 3 (bitstamp.net / btc-e.com / coinbase.com). I could be wrong, but I doubt it. Most those you've listed I've never even heard of. Perhaps there's traffic through the Chinese ones, but again they probably just have their version of Mt. Gox or bitstamp.net
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:30:39
Because when a big exchanger fails it has huge consequences on all of Bitcoin, as shown by the recent Mt. Gox fiasco.
I think the fact people are still putting so much trust and faith in a couple of big exchangers is a very important point
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:18:46
I'm not saying it's necessarily bad to have exchanges... I'm saying 99% of control and trust in one or two (with little to no oversight) is both extremely risky/stupid and hypocritical.
And I said pretty clearly I'm all in favor of those who develop applications and services to help make Bitcoin easier and more open to the public. I have no problem at all with them making a fair profit
@_date: 2014-03-31 20:03:07
Yeah because the RIAA and IRS are EXACTLY the same thing...
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:24:12


That's just an excuse for a poor decision on the communities part. Like I said putting that much trust into a single poorly run company was a TERRIBLE idea and it was hardly something people did "just to start". Mt. Gox existed long after places like bitstamp.net came about. And anyway what makes bitstamp.net any better? Are you the type of person that needs to keep putting their hand in the fire to see if it still burns you?


Using your logic then that means Bitcoin adoption and use has DECREASED the last 3 months, correct? Since it's gone from $1,000 in Dec to $500 now...
@_date: 2014-09-17 16:35:30
I think the Bitcoin community should be just as mad at itself for letting some jackass handle 1/2 billion dollars worth of coins
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:06:55
Just a turn of phrase bud :)
@_date: 2015-01-05 05:28:33
This argument can be used until the price reaches $10.
For the majority of people invested now it is completely and utterly meaningless
@_date: 2014-03-27 19:06:03
So btc-e.com and bitstamp.net don't have the majority? It's evenly spread now amongst 10-20+ exchangers? I doubt that
@_date: 2015-01-04 15:51:32


I live in Romania and have never even heard of this site, let alone use it before.
I've always used Bitstamp without issue. My bank (ING) allows me to instantly convert RON to EUR or USD and then I send those to Bitstamp.
So yeah... Nothing lost IMO
@_date: 2015-01-04 10:30:11
TIL being robbed at gunpoint is the same as willingly giving your money over to someone!
And yes people were naive in relation to Gox too and should have known better. It doesn't take a genius to realize that storing your life savings with a 3 year old company with just a couple of employees is a bad fucking idea
@_date: 2015-01-05 05:29:51
Can someone explain the story behind this please?
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:46:35
Okay he's a scammer/scumbag and whatever else, but people really ought to be more careful how and where they invest their money.
I'm willing to bet a significant number of those who invested in this bullshit did so out of greed, nothing more. Their eyes were so glazed over by this promise of a guranteed $20 floor, they basically threw everything they could at it. I even read comments by some guy who had invested everything and has lost $40,000 worth of BTC on this crap.
How as a grown adult can you be so naive? How did you make it through life without knowing that if something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Seriously WTF?
This is what annoys me about all these so called victims. They are their own worst enemies and they were motivated by greed. It wasn't as if this was some non-profit charity coin that has run away with donor's money.
Anyway people never learn. Considering how tech savy the average cryptocurrency user is suppose to be, you'd really think they would be a bit smarter by now.
Downvote me all you like, but it's the truth
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:57:03
Seriously? This is how people think?
I love Bitcoin, but this might be one of the most stupid threads I've seen on here.
They stole it to CONVERT IT TO DOLLARS. Nothing more. It has value to them because they can exchange it for the mighty dollar and buy whatever they want.
Surely people realize that...
@_date: 2017-01-11 11:51:22
You mean if it weren't for being able to speculate on USD price comparison and convert back into USD, you wouldn't be able to pay for college and stuff.
1 Bitcoin has and always will be 1 Bitcoin
