also probably because the most useful tx scenario on social media would be tips and there is no way in hell Bitcoin can handle that. Everyone seems to be ignoring the fact that Bitcoin just doesn't work for these scenarios any more. If he chooses a different coin, if any coin, people here will blame bias instead of just looking at the facts.

Well it seems to be that the comment suggested that it wouldn't be added because it would undermine bitcoin, but I feel like the primary reason would be that it isn't a good fit.

Ignoring the issues aren't gonna make them go away, he makes a good point.

I don't love Litecoin a whole lot, but it is based very much off of Bitcoin (main changes are block times, max supply, and SegWit) and it actually works. Bitcoin is broken at the moment, and it is very fair to call Litecoin "improved Bitcoin" due to it being heavily, heavily influenced by and similar to Bitcoin. It is known to be that. Charlie Lee counts on that for success, as even he has explained before. Until Bitcoin actually works well, people will know it as that. I am not a douche, I am just able to be objective. The "less security" thing really doesn't effect the coins network in practice, as it is as dominated by ASIC's as Bitcoin is. And it is a smaller coin, of course it is technically less secure. That doesn't make it insecure.
As long as I am getting downvoted though, I'll say it. PoW, ASIC resistant or not, has major scaling flaws that Litecoin has addressed somewhat, but obviously hasn't fixed. Bitcoin is in need of a better solution. PoS has issues, sure, but it has solved a lot of issues. MimbleWimble technology, somethijng that could be merged with Bitcoin, solves scaling in a more real way (or at least Grin does, a coin in development based on MimbleWimble tech).
Let's not kid ourselves; Bitcoin has been forked and improved dozens of times, and Litecoin is obviously meant to be improved Bitcoin. Don't pretend their isn't an issue with the King.

Don't forget Adam Back, who had the original idea for Hashcash!

Litecoin didn't really lead to Bitcoin's development, it is just improved Bitcoin. I guess you could say that Litecoin Segwit adoption influenced Bitcoin, but really Lee just improved Bitcoin's source code.
And Charlie Lee has a huge fan base, nobody's forgetting that guy for a while. Moreso mentioning the somewhat forgotten guys.

Blockstream is a clusterfuck leading Bitcoin in a terrible direction. I think Hashcash helped lead to Bitcoin, but I wouldn't want to shake Adam Back's hand.
Waiting for the ban hammer.

There is a French documentary on Mt Gox coming out featuring the subject of the AMA, I'm pretty sure.

Check out the Litecoin subreddit to see the post. It truly is informative and gives good insight to what Segwit is and why Bitcoin may never be able to get it. It doesn't trash talk Bitcoin at all, however, but just explains things. This post getting deleted doesn't benfit anyone really.
