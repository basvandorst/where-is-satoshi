What if I like Starblocks and Zip Coffee, but Zip and Starblocks are major competitors so they don't have a connecting channel?  I can see companies creating partnerships like reward cards.  Meaning I would then have to open payment channels with everyone I wanna pay.

Ha I was seeing pizzaholie

They are a very small exchange. They took on a lot of traffic when Bitfloor went down. I have seen them acquire something like 3k new members in the last couple days. They don't have the capacity for this much traffic right now. No conspiracy.

Honestly I was a bitfloor user as well. I am currently using Campbx as my only exchange right now simply because they have ACH and it's very easy to get money in.  It is ran by good people and I anticipate that they will update their servers as they unexpectedly got a large increase in users recently.

It's working fine for me right now but it went offline during the initial crash. Right now it is taking upwards to 3 minutes to load a page.  They need to update for their increased traffic.

I finally got one in a 140.5. Ive been trying since 128. It's so frustrating. I really hope they update big time now that they realize the amount of traffic they can expect when shit like this happens.

Huh, that's odd. I'm using Gox and CampBX and it is working fine for me so it might be on your end.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:23:09
At least im not the only one. I read they keep a lot of their coins in cold storage so hopefully we get them soon. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:50:04
Me too, I have only been in the bitcoin game for a few days now and I was just starting to get comfortable with their interface.  Anyway I moved to CampBX. Hopefully it will turn out better. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:25:01
Yeah they are completely down for me. Very frustrating. I was enjoying using them until this happened. Now I am unable to buy as I watch the price steadily rise
EDIT now its falling. Should have known.

CampBX is down... great.  They'll come back online after the price stabilizes and screw me out of moneys 
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:49:42
CampBX does it and it's pissing me off right now because they are so slow it takes too long. By the time I confirm my order the price has already risen 5 bucks
@_date: 2013-04-24 20:05:44
Yes, took 5 days. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 03:16:31
Working fine for me. What exchange are you using?
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:22:51
Shouldn't it be &lt;$100?
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:37:48
Just got mine after 5 hours. All is well. 
@_date: 2013-04-27 06:25:21
I only have 0.95097876 :(
@_date: 2013-04-25 22:39:41
Yeah I know you're right on quickness. However I have read a handful of negative things about BTC-e's security and service on this sub.  Out of all the exchanges I do believe Campbx to be the most secure and I like to trade Murican ;) 
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:46:42
Yeah CampBX sucks ass right now. Saw the price go from 125-140 back down to 132 now back up to 140 and I can't do anything with it.
@_date: 2013-06-10 07:52:55
My guess: Some millionaire is drunk as shit on a Sunday night with his buddies and is like, "haha hey guys wanna see something funny? Watch, I can totally make the price of Bitcoin shoot up like 10 bucks with a click of the mouse right here and totally reverse this downward trend, watch watch..... **click** ***price shoots up** "HAHAHAHAhAHA BITCOIN WHOOOO!!!" ***takes shots with hot bitches and jumps in pool**

Looks like the Russian mob needed some quick funds.
