If you plot the all time lows in the daily exchange rate averages on MtGox you are left with an exponential growth trend.... A look at the underlying, non speculative, growth trend in online gambling with BTC tells you that it is more likely than not that we will close out 2013 above 50USD per BTC.

The coins traded vs coins transferred ratio is trending down so it seems unlikely that we are in bubble territory. With ask walls being put up by old coiners (bitcoin days being destroyed is well up over Feb) it seems there will not be a repeat of the 2011 correction in the near future.
@_date: 2013-02-25 12:59:05
No where near yet but there are some interesting options being explored:
@_date: 2013-11-11 04:17:17
Ripple already exists. Give it a year or 2 to come along side.

Can't extend the 0.8 chain as on btcguild we are mining 0.7
However I did read the blocknumber off a 0.8 node so that is the dummy bit...

Interesting how using HSBC Bank, recently settling for USD 1.9 Billion with DOJ for laundering money for Mexican drug cartels, carries no such legal considerations....
@_date: 2013-03-06 01:41:54
Are you kidding? This is only just starting.
There is not much resistance in the market other than some old coiners trying to "manage" the price rise by dripping coins and building the odd ask wall to avoid extreme upward movement and a repeat of 2011. Just look at the "bitcoin days destroyed cumulative" trend to verify this.
Hence you can effectively buy them at a discount at present. If it was not for these "wise men" we would be way over 50 by now and looking at a lot more volatility.......

Good thing there is p2p exchange Ripple.
@_date: 2013-02-25 12:52:33
I have not gone beyond eyeballing it myself.
On the same page there are 2 wildly different charts for transaction volume alone so no idea which definition they are using for the ratio graph.
But in principle it seems like a good bubble indicator to watch.

The GH/s were never there on the 6990....

Maybe a bot trying go long in small increments to avoid slippage.

Always make backups! Just go to C:\Users\"YOUR USER DIRECTORY"\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin and copy the wallet.dat file. MAKE MORE THAN ONE COPY and store them somewhere safe! I suggest you read up on  before doing anything else!
For the update to version 0.8.0 you just make sure the client is not running and then just run the update. It will not touch your wallet! It will take some time to re-index though.
@_date: 2013-03-06 06:41:09
A good CPU helps when synchronizing but after that it is more of a hard disk bottleneck. Hence better use caching to minimize the read and writes to disk. The 0.8.0 will use all cores compared to the previous version which could not so that alone will help a lot of older duo and quad cores.
SSD sounds like a good speed gain but those disks do not have a very long life span with intensive read write operations.  large cache + Old style hard disk is likely a more economical solution over the mid term.
@_date: 2013-03-06 06:28:34
In that case I would just set it at 500 and turn it on once every couple of days. That will speed up the synchronizing. Then just turn it off again and use your RAM for other programs.  If I keep my client on with caching it gets to about 700 after 3 days of non stop running. This will likely rise over time as the blocks get bigger....and as I leave it on longer...
The longer I leave it on with high caching the fewer disk reads I notice.

Possibly some of the old coiners are trying to stop the price from rising to sharply and risk a sharp correction. Would not be great PR given the last one in 2011. At present the Coins traded vs coins transacted ratio is trending down which seems like a healthy sign to me. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 05:08:12
I suspect the shortages are due to existing security measures at the exchanges. Likely their "hot" wallets need more and or more frequent top ups...

It is a bit more disruptive and potent than gold.
Have a look at this video get a better understanding of how bitcoin is more than an e-currency or electronic gold. Don't forget it is a protocol before anything else...

AMD cards do a multitude better than Nvidia cards due to a difference in architecture. Don't bother with Nvidia unless you have free power.

Fair enough. The support at S$35 makes sense and does not allow them to be arbitraged either. In fact they will make a killing in just a few days at this rate.

party is over....
@_date: 2013-02-25 12:46:57
Correct, thanks!

BTC Guild on their PPLS pays out effectively 97%+transaction costs for the block. This works great. At your Mh/s you are looking at making around 0.04 - 0.05 BTC per day. Ordering a Jalapeno is one thing but getting it is another... By the time you get it the difficulty will be astronomically higher. There are thousands of orders in queue before you... Better spread your bets.

Maybe you best wait for BTC to hit 100+ and then treat yourself to a new PC ;-?
@_date: 2013-03-06 13:26:13
Market cap is just a valuation method.
Much more crucial is the velocity of the bitcoins in the economy.
Each day 1-2 million BTC change hand valued at the exchange rate.
Lets say it is 1.0 million BTC per day on average for 360 days at $50/BTC.
That is 18 Billion USD worth of transactions going on per year. 
@_date: 2013-03-10 03:12:00
Perfect, very nice.
@_date: 2013-03-06 08:24:22
I would agree with Anenome and tbeau
Besides the trade vs transaction ratio is still in the normal range.

I might trust it a little sooner provided the jurisdiction is pro free market and accommodating to hard money.

Regulatory controls on gold will imho be the more likely reason for bitcoin to outlast gold. At present the cash price for gold is already higher than the "paper gold" price. This internal bleeding cannot be sustained by the system no matter how much they want to leverage paper gold further to subdue its price.... hence gold bugs beware.

Fundamentals are sound with amazon news etc. etc. This is just day traders trying to dump a couple of million worth, make a panic and then buy back cheap. Best medicine = sit tight and do not sell. 
You will see the price bounce back right up again at these bargain prices.
Especially with all the liquidity still on the way to exchanges today...

The GPU miners are liking this, but the Avalon miners and ASICMiner are loving it...

The bitcoin protocol will allow for these types of features.
Have a look at the future possibilities

If those printed dollars ever pop out of the ongoing derivative bubble it will pump up the Bitcoin market cap like monetary orgasm...Only in dollar terms but still a great hedge.
