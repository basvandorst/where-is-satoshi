And then confiscate your house in return? 


Bitcoin won't loan you as an entity but you can try asking individuals holding bitcoin instead. There are even platforms making finding individuals looking to loan people bitcoin easier for you. How much is another thing. Individuals don't have the power to seize your house of course, so if you don't show that the chances you'll return the loaned money back are good you won't get any.

That's correct. And coinbase already bans users that are using their wallet service to deposit to unregistered gambling websites. I haven't heard any horror stories from people using their API but they're also known for passing ToS updates under the table.

What's more worrying is that freenom is the only registrar of this tld. They give them away for free since their entire business model is based on buying the domain you're using just so you can transfer it. I can't think of a good reason that coinfire's people wouldn't pay the small fee to actually acquire the domain.

I see you're confident that your investment will turn out returning more BTC than what you originally put in. But there are several things that could prevent this. First, read the terms of the plan, throughout. Do they seem fair to you, do you think that cryptsy will live up to the promise? 
If you answered yes you're good with that. But that's not all, you should also do the math for your own. 
Use  to calculate for how long this plan could be profitable for. There are several scenarios, ideally the difficulty could stay the same or even drop and in that case those plans might have the potential to keep spewing bitcoins at you for years but that seems unlikely. Mining plans tend to lose value over time (take cex.io's case as an example look at where the buy for Gh/s price started and where it ended) all because of the difficulty increases. 
If you're comfortable with all this and still think that this investment will earn you a ROI over time then keep your mining shares without worry. Otherwise you should preferably sell them soon before they loose more of their value.

Are ISP's responsible for you watching illegal porn with the help of their network? **no**
Are banks responsible for drug dealers using them as a service provider? **no**
Is Bitcoin a money laundering scheme because some criminals use it? **no**
Why do you think it's bad that OKpay is neutral amongst it's costumers? That's the price you've got to pay for neutrality, the service provider won't discriminate against you, but other users may use this neutrality to their advantage.

Here's a translation of the key sentences:
* *Bitcoin has no negative effect on us now.* Implies that banks are the gatekeepers of the economy, and since bitcoin is a competitor to their services...
* *It could have an effect on us if mass adoption is achieved. Please regulate it before that.*

Cryptsy seems like a legit company. If that's what concerns you, don't worry about them stealing your money or something. I'd trust them with all my BTC, they've never stolen any coins or taken any non responsible decision as far as I'm concerned. 
However what you can't make sure when you're buying a mining contract is that it's ran legitimately. That's why I think it's always not that of a good idea to invest into such a thing (besides all the unpredictability with the difficulty etc that could make it useless in just two difficulty shifts). Even if the mining operation is controlled by someone like cryptsy, it's still hard for them to prove that they're not a ponzi scheme. And to this point, only the operations above have proven that they're not in fact ponzi schemes. Maybe zeushash too [but]( ... 
The *legit* ones though still put more risk towards the side of the investor, and don't seem that of attractive when compared to shady alternatives. 
If what you're looking to do is to diversify your assets, you should really look to other alternatives. Don't be fooled by the shiny word **mining**. Other investments can earn you a faster ROI with less risk of loosing your initial input. Take trading of (almost) any kind as an example out of the many other alternatives.  
TL;DR You shouldn't be worried about the mining operation you're invested in being ran by a non reputable company, the state and business tactics of the entire industry of cloud mining is what's more worrying.

The .cf is a "free" tld. You can purchase it if you want to run more of a professional website, Buying it means that you technically own the domain and you can transfer it to any reputable provider. Apparently coinfire admins didn't. Makes me think that they probably were a just some 15 year olds.

Those bots hadling the 10(+) bits transactions rather than the changetip corporate opperation though. It didn't became apparent to us why those bots were shut down but as it turns out changetip is more of a centralised corporative opperation rather than a saviour servicing the community.

How is a statement apolitical if it's a standard of anarchism or liberalism? That doesn't really make much sense. 


There're all kinds of people using bitcoin already. When you say *we* as bitcoiners you're referring to different kinds of people.
Why? For the simple reason that using bitcoin doesn't require you to accept a certain kind of polity or constitution. Everyone can use it for his own needs and set his own standards because it's neutral.  
And to be clear, I'm just saying that we should project a more friendly image. Why should what you yourself described as apolitical seem like a hostile environment?
@_date: 2015-03-04 18:58:15
Who said it's the people from wall street that think like that? It's just most bitcoiners. Take bitcoinaverage as an example, it's the most popular bitcoin ticker that indicates an "average price" among exchanges. Many think of it as the official "average price" ticker. Yet it doesn't take exchanges with 0 trading fees into account. And that's almost all the Chinese exchanges.

The way they lock accounts for security is really professional too. 
They rolled out a new update without any warning, after I tried to login I was sent an email, thinking it was an authentication mail I clicked the link and my account got locked automatically. 
They had changed the fucking mails so that you were receiving a mail asking you if you want to instantly lock your account...

Snapchat isn't any significant piece of technology. It's a messenger app. The only difference with it is that messages sent with it are deleted 'permanently' after some seconds of being received. Give it some massive media coverage and it's now the most popular messaging app. What's funny is that the application still has unfixed bugs and exploitable glitches since day one. And even the only fundamentally 'innovative' thing about it is a lie. The 'snappening' happened, millions of private pictures and videos sent with the app were leaked because it ends up that those 'permanently deleted messages' were stored in servers with minimal to no protection. 
You'd ask, why would a sane person use this app? Well, most people using it are sane. Just not clever/tech-savvy enough to do their research. The user demographic of snapchat mostly consists of teenagers. And trust me, being able to download an app in your smartphone doesn't make you tech-savvy as a teenager. 
 The plethora of people using the app are not significant. Even if they get to know about bitcoin, it won't have any positive effect on it. Since, you know... The described demographic doesn't have the money or mental capacity to affect bitcoin.
So there you have it, nice ELI50 eh? The hate for the teenage mob that uses snapchat comes out of me naturally though. How can you not hate it though? Just... [look at it](
