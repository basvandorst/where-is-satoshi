My personal recommendation 100 ETH, 25 lite, the rest bitcoin. And if you feel real bawlsy do 5 dollars on vertcoin

It's a bubble!
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:38:56
S2x is an attack on Bitcoin. If you believe in what bitcoin stands for you will dump it. If you are more focused on money than I am sure you will hold it until you see that it is indeed dropping in price. I will continue to hodl the one true bitcoin because of what it stands for

You aren't wrong lol, I guess I mean less to the moon and more just sitting on the same numbers for a while. But I am no expert, just an avid Reddit scroller

Can you give me the link to the discord

Same for my parents, if we go to the moon I can pay them back
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:36:13
This is what I have been trying to tell people as well. The dip likely won't go to 5k or lower because of the sole fact that so many people are waiting for that dip to jump on. Once they jump on and the price starts skyrocketing again, we will see ATH's quicker than ever before. If bitcoin is truly hitting a trend phase the bubble won't be popping for a while. Seems too good to be true, but this is the prize for buying your ticket to the moon early

r/litecoin just had a thread on this. May be worth going over there. It's a paper notice picture
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:08:58
I messaged their mods asking if they are working on fixing the issue as it is a problem for all of Reddit. They said votes reflect the users feelings. Since its such a censored forum here they use votes instead
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:17:23
True but won't difficulty go up by March when they come out? 5 of them running at once would be 4,500/month. Not sure if the 30/day includes utility and what not

@_date: 2017-11-01 18:03:26
That would be a great time to buy but I doubt we will ever see 4k again
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:58:12
We invest in bitcoin because of what it stands for. It is the next big thing. It's like a kickstarter really 
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:30:58
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:53:29
It depends on the kind of friends you have. I have had those friends that will expect you to pay for everything if they know you have money. Those don't stay in my life long. Now I pick a very select couple of friends to talk about my investments with because I know they won't put me in a position of telling them off.
That being said if they hurt on money and BTC goes to the moon I am going to help them out. Don't ask and you shall receive

Quality shitpost
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:38:14
So first off I understand your situation. What I have done is told every significant other(SO) that investment account money is for investment purposes only. It is in my control so if SO decides to mooch and quit her job it wont work out for her. It may be seen as cruel but I expect my SO to continue growing and pushing as I do, quitting all activities that take effort and mooching is unattractive and I would leave. 
Even if you have the money most investors would say it is wise to take out loans and mortgages. Just with bigger downpayments. 
Investment purchases include house purchases, house renovations, etc. Because I can rent out a house or areas of the house to help pay the mortgage and then create income. 
Every ONCE IN A WHILE I will use it for an anneversary/birthday/holiday. Not every year though. It lets SO know that I will break my rule of investment purposes only to make them feel special. However, I don't want to make it a habit and as long as that is communicated they should understand. 
For marriage sign a prenup on the bitcoin. In General, I am not a fan of keeping secrets from my SO. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:02:41
I bought 4 days ago, I buy after the fork, I buy 1 or 2 weeks from there. Price is irrelevant as it's all going up long run
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:17:07
It can be king at 1k per coin sure that makes sense

@_date: 2017-11-14 06:19:56
This was from r/BCH?
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:18:38
So I personally go wherever the vision is. I have seen what BTCC has to offer and I am not a fan. Not gonna bash on you or anything and I respect that you have chosen to support BCH. However, I subscribed to both BTC and BCH. Guess who mentions the other side more? BCH talks about bitcoin in a negative light FARRR more. That community came off as way more toxic to me until eventually I had to unsubscribe because it was so bad. I do my own research and don't rely on Reddit for my sole source of info. That being said there is a higher amount of falsification from bch's reddit
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:47:47
How do we know if we have BCH or BTC? Where do we see the breakdown in commonly used wallets?
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:23:36
Is this buyable or preorderable yet?
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:16:31

@_date: 2017-11-04 00:31:53
Going down? It went from 7.4k to 7k. Calm down... it is normal for it to fluctuate especially when there is panic from a fork and hype from new people. The subreddit is going nuts lately I bought more at 7k, then I will buy more after the fork whether it goes up or down. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:00:07
You sound just as dumb as any of us. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:10:04
I don't tell anyone who is not a friend about my investments. They treat you differently 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:52:47
Yeah I got that. But does them having 52% hash give merit to what they say? Are they brainwashed plebs, or are they like the OGs of bitcoin who saw something great and full of potential? And are we the naysayers? Or do we have proof for the reason we know it won't work? Not criticizing just asking for unbias knowledge 
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:32:27
Is this something we should celebrate?
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:47:33

Hmm seems like a risky gamble. By that time I am sure new technology will be released... might it be better to just buy bitcoin? What is your train of thought if you don't mind me asking? Enlighten

Next week it is supposed to recovered. Starting monday

There is still another attack by BCH also if segwit2x still goes through...

Why so you can buy more when it dips, or so that you can feel validated about your own choice to sell?

@_date: 2017-11-11 19:39:00
Ugh unfortunately I only have a brand new one... not nearly as contaminated.. sorry about that 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:05:18
When I subbed to r/BTC that article is paid for by someone over there. Can anyone say petty?!

I will use fiat probably. How much a month do you think they make per?

The money you have sitting in there will be used to fund BCH. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:55:11
Knowing the industry, the intent of the developer, and economics degree knowhow. We won't see sub 6k. Remind me in 3 weeks and hold it against me if I am wrong
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:18:15
Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:49:39
Went to the r/BTC sub just now. It's so polar opposite in opinions. BCH apparently just hit 1k. They think BCH will be 4k leaving BTC 2k by 2 months time. But on this sub it's going to tank because it is a pump and dump? Then we will continue going to new heights? Somebody fill me in

1. Don't spend money you can't afford to lose
2. ALWAYS communicate to your significant other. The fact you didn't communicate about something that clearly should have been talked about first is why you are here. If you took the time to talk to her you could have bought at 3k. 
3. Breathe easy and do research. Hold it do not panic sell. Lots of good threads and articles talking about why we are seeing what we are. Also talk to your wife and eat your punishment. We are not going to save you. That is on you
