This is all spot on about how it is in Indo, OP isn't trying to pull anything quick on anyone. My SO is Indo but an American citizen now, her father does real estate development and construction there and she owns some properties through him and goes back to work for him each year as well. Of course it is better if you have someone in Indo you already know and trust but deals like this are very common just because of how anti-foreigner the laws in Indo are.

Should be noted that the last 1000 tips for BTC goes back about 2 months and the last 1000 tips for Doge goes back about 1 hour. So Doge has about 1440 tips for every BTC tip.

They messed up but in my opinion it's good they are all coordinated, it's the one thing that can stimmy the oncoming rush.

Loans aren't money, they are promissory notes. When someone purchases loans they aren't paying money for money they are paying money for the rights to collect payments. It's a little different than buying dollars with dollars because nothing is guaranteed when you buy a loan.

Yes multiple exchanges posted statements about gox insolvency and Gox goes down at the same time, the same time that a supposedly false leaked document said it would all start. Totally all coincidence.

That's linear growth, not exponential. HUGE difference.

For anyone else who can't see the update: 
The Bitcoin foundation has emailed a statement about the situation:
“We are shocked to learn about Mt. Gox’s alleged insolvency. While we are unable to comment on whether or not Mt. Gox's business operations employed operational best practices and reasonable accounting procedures, we can assure the public that the Bitcoin protocol is functioning properly.”

You mean the HUGE 2-3% fees? Bitcoin exchanges have fees and there will most definitely be fees if it ever goes mainstream as currency.


They shouldn't have recourse, if they are accepting stolen CCs then they are not following proper procedure


Are we still in the 90s? If the card goes through then the funds are approved and available. Credit is just as good as cash with the exception of having to pay the 2-3% fee on CCs


What about security?


Making it more easily manipulated

But imagine the PR we could pull of if we combined our communitys funds!

Eh, thats only cause of the dogecar winning. Normally it is around 1000 give or take a couple hundred.

While I primarily dabble in doge I am also active in bitcoin like many people in crypto. I think there needs to be some kind of cryptocurrency awareness foundation that Is funded by all the major cryptos which could use the funds to bring crypto to the masses via ads, sponsorships etc. If doge can do this by itself imagine what btc+ltc+doge+peer could do.

Fuck paypal, they will take your money with no reason and fuck you over at every turn possible if you use their services to sell anything. I REALLY hope paypal does not become a player in the cryptocurrency realm, I will never use any of their services ever again.

What point are you trying to make?

It will drop again when the information we suspect is confirmed.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:38:39
Because Gox hasnt announced they are insolvent yet, I'm guessing they were supposed to at 10am JST but unsuprisingly screwed up. The other exchanges can't announce Goxes insolvency until Gox does for legal reasons.
@_date: 2014-06-13 00:36:00
Exactly, that was the whole point of the original post that you were questioning, that the government is recognizing that bitcoins have legitimate and legal value.
@_date: 2014-05-17 04:16:42
Come on, dont do this kind of stuff. Really?

I'm sure if you went to any country in the world and asked them what America was, exactly zero of them would think it referred to all of North, Central and South America. Now if you said "The America's" that is a different story.
He also said


So you can get off your high horse.

Its nice to see bit coin expanding but every online flower site I've dealt with was nothing but trouble and wasted money.
@_date: 2014-02-18 23:52:44
Paypal is one of the worst payment processors out there. They will take and hold your money for nearly no reason and with no substantiatinf evidence. I would hate to see such a company benefit from the rise if cryptocurrencies.

Obviously it is different in other languages, that doesn't even make sense to try to compare different languages, apples and oranges. But in English, the language everyone is communicating in here, America=USA. Just go search news sites of various countries and see what they use America to refer to, it will never be used to refer to the whole continent, only to refer to the USA.

You do realize hockey is much larger in many other countries besides America?

In the past week? That would be pretty impressive.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:37:32
Because Gox hasnt announced they are insolvent yet so they legally cant disclose that info until Gox does.
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:25:43
This is a horrible comparison considering you leave out the majority of what you have to do to pay with btc.
-You don't have to grab your phone?(much like your wallet)
-Passcode on your phone?
-Open app?
-Put in info before clicking send?
-Isn't the app from a third party?
Benefits of CC
-I can save the info on my comp
-I can charge back if something goes wrong
-I'm not liable for fraudulent purchases if I lose my card

You should have seen it when the announcement hit. Had like 5 pages of new posts in 5 minutes.
