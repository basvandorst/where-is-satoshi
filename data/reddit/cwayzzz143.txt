Now this Point I agree with.... regardless of the speculative statements in the article, no one should be using Tether until it is proven solvent.

Bitcoins are not kept on a PC they are on the blockchain. The private keys may be stored on his computer? Does he have the private keys? If thats the case start the PC in safe mode and hunt them down

This is pure speculation by the author. You are ignoring the fact that Bittrex explicitly states that USD pairings will not be open for everyone. They also state that USDT is a complicated situation but at no point mentions it will go away when they add usd

I agree with your sentiment, but your making a lot of assumptions. Many many people use credit cards with more than enough means to pay them back.

Koreans just woke up dude, its like 9:40am there. you think they were all up at 4am bailing on BTC driving the price down?

Trying to rack up them miles?

This has been posted already as it came out 3 days ago. Its sensationilst and speculative. Little facts and fear mongering. 
TLDR: This article is just a guess, and no better than anyone elses guess

What are you looking at to state there are a lot of shorts based on the contracts? I swear I saw an article stating that the recent futures were highly long/bullish

This is not to protect them from people not paying it back, it is to stall adoption. If they were conncerned about risk then they would not let you use your credit card in a casino.

This is an attempt to stall adoption. Risks are factored into the issuance of cards already. If they cared about people not being able to pay it back, they would ban the use of a credit card for gambling, buying cigarettes, prostitutes in vegas.
You can literally use your credit card to gamble online poker while waiting for the prostitue you ordered in Las Vegas. This is a smoke screen.
That said, please dont buy crypto on credit anyway.

Personally I would say the price resetting back 3-5 months is a serious dip. Resetting back a year or more is a crash.
