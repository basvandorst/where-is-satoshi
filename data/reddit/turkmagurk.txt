This site:  has links to wikipedia donations quite often.  I've used them before without any problems.  But if you're looking to donate a larger amount than $1-2, you're probably out of luck.

WHAAAAT? THAT'S AWESOME! Thanks!
I've been trying to use a faucet all day and got to that amount. You literally just doubled me up.  Sweet!

Thus reinforcing the importance of TAILS.

That's awesome.  Congrats on using it for something for yourself.  Hoping someday my 0.00580694 BTC will be worth more than a cup of coffee. :)

This is awesome. It's interesting that you ran into a couple of people who are on both sides of the fence about it.  Understandably, someone in compliance would be against it, but I'm glad you took the higher road.
Great story about how a grass-roots movement can slowly change people's minds on something.

You would need some *real* muscle to carry that out. Think of how heavy it is with all those coins!

A spender. I assume the free shipping associated with Prime can still be taken advantage of?

That's awesome.  Glad you added something to dispute someone posting it wasn't legit. BTW, you shouldn't use that Fix-a-flat stuff... it creates a terrible mess when you're trying to actually change your wheels. 
I'm sure you know that, since you're a car enthusiast- was just funny seeing it in the background.

How does this work in terms of shipping if I have an Amazon Prime account?

Thanks for the link. Was to lazy to do so myself in my terrible joke.

Indeed. Got bitched at by my tire guy when one of my rims was caked with the stuff. I'm not sure about the truth to it, but he also said it can mess with your alignment.
