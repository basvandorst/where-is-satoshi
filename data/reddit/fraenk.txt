I do absolutely feel your point here... then again... how else could such a new and genuine tool gain acceptance in a world based on pure capitalism?
I think btc will still live up to its potential when (if!) it gains global mainstream acceptance. The fundamental differences to debt-based-fiat and centralized profit oriented payment and money transfer services WILL have an effect on how our economy and society works. Regardless of under which focus it gained traction. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 18:51:41
How does this work?
Are they integrating a direct btc-to-$ service in the order process or are they actually pre-financing all the orders to just collect the bitcoins?

i didnt use a calculator, but rather my jalapeno's hashing power as a measure and taking into account how the returns diminish with rising difficulty... i guesstimate 9-12 months to get back the 0,0185 BTC you pay per GH... and in a year's time the MN1 will be worthless... so yeah... i guess if you collect some rewards for a month and can sell off the share at a minor profit... may be worth a shot... i bought 5

oh, and it has a bunch of coins where the faucet will only work for you if you do a payment via SMS (EUR0,99 per coin in EU)...
seems to be a nice faucet idea to build an audience and roll out a businessmodel later maybe?!

@_date: 2014-05-09 13:45:24
the problem really is, that the state can abuse such laws very badly.
they can take your money when THEY make a mistake
hell, even if they invent a new tax... they may just take that money from you however ridiculous the tax may be. Look at what happened in Cypress last year (and actually played a major role in the april-btc-bubble). They just decided to take 10% off of the citicen's bank accounts... without warning... and for what? To bail out banks and pay foreign banks their money... lol
BTC FTW!!!

but, not really THAT great, and opening new vectors of abuse... 
how does a receiver know if the funds received are reversible or not? if it isnt immediatly clear... here goes the paypal chargeback fraud in crypto-version.
also it sounds like a 100% premine launch with subsequent PoS... all this is good for is to get money into the pockets of the devs...
@_date: 2014-05-09 13:37:34
well... this has always been this way in Germany.
even if it is just tax-pre-payments (not actually calculated due-taxes but the in-advance-estimated-income-tax) will be taken from your bank-accounts if you fail to transfer immediately.
It is fricking insane... this happened to me a while back, not because i refused to pay, but because I had earned a lot less in the running year and they insisted i pay taxes based on last years total income... 
even while i was still negotiating with the tax administration proving to them how I had earned to little in the current year to pay the estimation based on the previous year. Suddenly "BOOM"... The ATM refuses to give me money, said my account was locked!
They had actually taken the FULL amount from all my THREE accounts!! Yes, they basically tried to secure three times what I owed them! All of the accounts instantly went frozen - none of them had enough on it to cover the requested amount. 1 Bank even took this as a reason to permanently shut-down my account immediately and transfer all that was on there to the state. 
When I called the tax administration to inquire what was going on, because I now wouldn't even be able to pay for rent and health insurance, the lady just verbally shrugged me off said that I would have to deal with it, because obviously i owed them money which i did not pay. WHAT? Well, thanks for your understanding, I guess a citizen facing homelessness doesn't matter after all!! 
Then it took another *6 months* to clarify the proper tax estimation (which I was both willing and able to pay) with the finance administration, all the while relying on a small stash of cash and the help of friends and family in order to pay rent, food and health insurance.
When finally everything was settled my bank accounts were reopened and I was stuck with all the overdraft fees, several delayed-payment-fees from the state, etc. etc. etc. all in all an extra 2kEUR on top of the "proper" amount of taxes...
Until today I still have a very bad credit rating due to which no bank will give me any credit, its troublesome to get a cellphone contract... etc.etc.etc.
Just to give you an idea how bad such laws can be played out!!
Bitcoin to the rescue... after all this had happened I grew an early interest in bitcoin, and bought in during last year's april rise... so, there's a sunny side to the story, too... i am now a crypto-enthusiast, and was able to catch a nice small profit by joining the team early on!!!
**TL;DR:** the German government will raid your bank account even based on THEIR estimations and before a final decision on the tax amounts has been made... You will be stuck with all the fees and bad credit ratings afterwards!
 
@_date: 2015-05-27 16:55:30
insane? care to elaborate?
potential gains are also "insane"... and trading risks are covered by diversity... so a stake in bitcoin really isn't that risky.
I think the main reason large funds don't invest into bitcoin is the fact that it is not traded on any well regulated platform. So legally it might be difficult to report and maintain "shares" in bitcoin.
Another hurdle with this is the lack of infrastructure, you cannot go to your trading partner or bank and order some bitcoins...
That's the reasons I can think of... the lack of officially recognized infrastructure and the legal grey area in which bitcoin still hovers.
The risk/reward tradoff doesn't speak against bitcoin at all imho

too bad i am not rich in BTC or $... I kind of wanted to spread the word similarly tipping 1upvote ($0.10) outside of the bitcoin-related subreddits... they hardly ever get collected.
I have not received any negative feedback either, though. People even responded with thank-yous and then did never collect their tips...
i'd say not more than 1/10 tips have actually been collected!
but, then again... i'd assume that while bitcoin has been on a downtrend for a while, a lot of people might have actually looked into it and dismissed it as silly internet tokens... my first reaction to bitcoin in 2011 was exactly like that... Only during the Apr '13 frenzy did I start to take it seriously
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:16:25
One* thing itches me:
As the raffles are paid and cashed out in $ denomination but actually executed in BTC, due to price fluctuations there will either be some BTC remaining in the jackpot (profit for the organizer?) or, and that's what actually concerns me, there will not be enough BTC in the Jackpot to pay out the full sum?!?
*edit:* I looked at the ["Winners" thread]( on the sub and it clarifies (kind of) that you don't take profit or cover losses, but rather just payout the total amount of BTC. Fair enough... but still leaves a problem. The tickets for the lottery fluctuate in proportion to their winning chance...
Why not just run the lottery in BTC instead of $ ?!? This would remedy the issues mentioned above and I personally believe it would also make for better marketing...
*^One ^thing ^besides ^the ^obvious ^problem ^that ^this ^can ^easily ^turn ^out ^to ^be ^a ^scam ^as ^there's ^just ^that ^one ^redditor ^who ^could ^at ^any ^time ^run ^off ^with ^the ^jackpot

@_date: 2015-02-02 15:58:45
I'm fine :)
as suggests... the changetip bot should recognize when a tip is being retweeted.
checking for a pseudo-RT would be one way, another (possibly more reliable) way would be to check the changetip-DB/Log for previously processed tips containing identical wording.
I am no expert, but maybe the twitter API does even contain some meta data to reveal if a tweet is a re-tweet -&gt; eg:  (looks like it indeed does!)
