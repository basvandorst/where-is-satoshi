You dern time travelers, git off my lawn!

I see you're tipping well in the lounge. Send them 1 cookie for me @_date: 2014-11-02 22:42:21
Ah, that's cool! I've thought about getting someone on like, Craigslist or Fiverr to hand out flyers at colleges and offer the students a free, say, $5 worth of Bitcoin if they email me with their school email. From there I could easily explain to them how Bitcoin works and answer all their questions;, however, I don't have the funds to support that.

Aw, people really threatening you? From my tipping spree yesterday I only received general questions, thanks and hearts,  and a few downvotes (mostly upvotes, though).
Let's keep it up though! The exposure is nice, maybe we could use a portion of the funds in [the address dedicated to advertising efforts] ( to help?

Could you define "distributed sharing of what we all should have?" I can't tell if you're referring to a communist-type government and you're asking how we should spread/give basic necessities to all (ex. food, clothing, water) or something else.
I'm also not sure what your current business model is, so I can't comment on that either.
You'll probably see better replies if you're a little more specific :).

It's ironic how a company who's such a "firm believer in free speech and a free press" feels threatened enough to threaten to take legal action against Coinfire, especially considering their forum is anything but free speech, with the constant shadowbanning and other shady stuff going on there...
I want GAW's death to be slow and painful.

Yeah, 100 bits is about enough to over a transaction fee and that's aboutit. I'll start tipping 1000 bits rather than 100 then :)

What are the main differences between the Trezor, Ledger Wallet, and CryptoLabs' Case?
@_date: 2014-11-30 01:58:36
This is actually pretty accurate for a few people I know, nice comic :).
@_date: 2014-11-02 02:33:49
I'm donating 100 bits here and there when I can. Currently have 38 mBTC in my Changetip account but I can add more anytime I need :).
A few people seem to have taken interest in Bitcoin after I tipped them, which is actually really cool.

A lot of the more recent ones have been due to malicious Tor exit nodes stripping the SSL from the blockchain site, which would cause you to connect to the http:// rather than https:// version of the website which meant the data transmitted wasn't encrypted and it made it easy to fall victim to a MITM (Man in the Middle) or other type of attack.
@_date: 2014-11-30 13:54:48
You bring up some great points, thanks!
As for the CryptoLabs wallet, I sent them an email yesterday asking about them technically having control of 2/3 of the keys, which would let them send a transaction, and what would happen in case of a DDoS attack on their servers that verify the biometrics and sign transactions. 
However, you've convinced me and now I'm leaning more towards getting a Trezor.
@_date: 2014-11-02 23:02:18
I also tipped mostly on the front page :).
@_date: 2014-12-07 02:18:39
It's likely just an email spoofer and not an email legitimately from Blockchain.info. You could probably analyze the header and see.
@_date: 2014-11-02 22:45:00
If we do get something like this going, I'd definitely chip in!
@_date: 2014-11-01 19:53:33
I'm on it boss!

How about those who bought Paycoins for $20 via Credit Card through Paybase?
How about those who purchased Hashtakers that are now losing them money rather than earning them money?
Just because you were able to gain money doesn't mean that nobody has lost money.

Just a word of caution, this is NOT the user that I spoke with who asked me to compile questions that the community had for GAW.
However, I cannot confirm nor deny whether or not this is Josh. Since this account was made two hours ago and the one that contacted me was made 10 months ago, I have my doubts.
@_date: 2015-01-02 04:52:08
Whoa, I disliked him purely for GAW and his false/undelivered promises, blatant manipulation, and censorship. I had no idea what went on with that eBay thing.
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:12:35
Thanks! I'm currently waiting on some more information from other's that I can review and then post, as there's no way I've covered everything :).
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:13:39
Nice! I'll also try and see what I can find about the mining statement.
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:35:39
Thanks! I meant to include that but I totally forgot about it, added :)
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:34:22
So, because I question your identify "Garza" you threaten legal action? What case do you have?
Considering I just recently spoke with Garza and he did not have such a condescending tone I will **NOT** take a single word you say seriously until you're able to verify your identity.
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:01:45
Added to the original post, thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:56:57




Hm? I'd assume that the Cease and Desist letter to coinfire after they showed that GAW wasn't actually partnered with these companies would be enough proof that there weren't legitimate partnerships.

Has anyone here seen 'The Interview' recently? Garza reminds me of Kim Jong Un and his followers in the way that they 'look up to him as a god' and promises a lot but actually delivers on so little. 
I'm not sure how the conference would work but it would be lovely if someone was able to have a Q/A session with Garza when he isn't behind his smoke and mirrors over at Hashtalk.
