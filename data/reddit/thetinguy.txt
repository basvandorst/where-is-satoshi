NSA doesn't do magic. While in 2008, the iPhone 3G was easily exploited and jailbreakable, the same isn't true for an iPhone 5s running iOS 7.

Because generally they are a terrible company, and bitcoin competes with them as well. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 02:00:02
feel free to prove those exploits exist today and not 5 years ago.

Fraud detection is hard. Do you think corporations full of smart people are so stupid they don't understand the customer service consequences of their actions? Of course they do you idiot, and it's a balance they try to strike between security and convenience.

Bitcoin would be better off without Luke Jr.  So that's a good thing if xt takes over. 
@_date: 2012-02-24 18:50:24
So this is basically amazon mechanical turk except with bitcoins? cool beans.

It's a good show if you like legal drama.

I know everyone s saying no, but of course it is. You can never rule out that there is a vulnerability that has so far gone unnoticed.

Did you take a D.A.R.E. class yesterday?
@_date: 2011-05-17 00:06:02
Wait what? I thought there was an OS X client avaliable from bitcoin.org. Sorry if I am wrong, but I am just starting to wrap my head around BTC's
@_date: 2011-12-27 12:52:35


Haha are you upset I called you out for talking out of your ass?
@_date: 2011-12-26 04:45:39


You are dumb. Every BTC ever spent is completely traceable and will be forever. The god damn block chain is just a list of who sent who bitcoin. 
@_date: 2011-05-17 10:22:53
Sorry if this is a dumb question but I was looking at the historical value of the BTC with repect to the USD at Mt. Gox and noticed the huge spike in the exchange rate in the past month or so.
@_date: 2015-02-14 03:33:59
Oh no!!!1 not your internet points!1!!

Actually it's more of a FUD issue. The guy who they quote works for a competitor.


@_date: 2015-02-15 23:08:05
Stuff like this is why this subreddit is terrible. Everyone knows the vast majority of money in the world does not exist as cash. Pretending like it does is disingenuous 
@_date: 2013-11-05 04:15:55
subways are all franchised. probably this one subway takes them.
