The mods are having too much fun with banning and taking action instead of actually providing real solutions to censorship problems. Many people were yelling at subs like and but no one was complaining about the fact that Reddit only provided *temporary, face-saving solutions* (by revoking their default sub status) and didn't provide any *long-term solutions*. It's a systematic problem with Reddit management/development that needs to be fixed... and it's not going to get fixed unless people take action against the right people.

That doesn't mean you shouldn't even try to demand justice...

Either Reddit has to step up its game and increase transparency options not only for its administration, but for subreddit owners... or people are going to have to leave for other communities.

I don't think anyone does. No one is suggesting that Reddit forfeit its rights as a private entity...
However, this question is ultimately misguided and unhelpful. Let's think of a progressive change resulting from actions of people:
According to the law, women didn't have the consitutional right to vote until the passage of the 19th Amendment. Do you think people didn't bother demanding universal suffrage because they "had a problem with the law"? No; they did have a problem with the law, and they fought for changing it. They demanded better *because* they didn't have those rights; if they hadn't done so they would have never earned those rights.

X-post of mine, I think it's relevant:
For a guy who has a pay-to-be-unbanned feature, he has every damned incentive to promote censorship and get his users in trouble as frequently as possible but *just* avoid too much negative attention.

I was on the subject of Reddit jeopardizing free speech... I really don't care if Reddit bans subs so long as they do it good reason and transparency to the public about what they have banned.

That's a technicality. They can't continue with their accounts, but they will have to pay to make a new one if they can't figure out how to take the two seconds to change their IPs. On top of that you have a whole other class of people effected by these measures:


...all under the guise of "preventing spam".

Ok, fine. I don't think anyone is saying that private property is the problem here, though.

They don't care. There hasn't been a single transparency-increasing feature added to Reddit at least since 3 years ago (as far as I bothered to look). It's just a bunch of fixes (I'm not downplaying their importance) to improve the UE or to improve some guilded-only feature: basically it's only about Reddit's bottom line (never go full corporate!). Since those three years ago, the only things that could even come close to being "transparency-increasing" were the addition of "ban reasons" and the "moderator action log" which are *internal tools only available to other moderators*... so the only transparency that was increased was that inside the moderators' group of each subreddit and not between the subreddits' users and moderators, which is the most critical place for increasing transparency.

I have no way to verify your claims, but, even for that amount, I think that the pay-to-be-unbanned feature shows insight into how you run things.

On top of that, you can't really prove what you said because your profile can't be viewed by other people. It's like the Reddit admins are trying to weaken your abilities to defend yourself and mobilize other people for a cause... wait a second...

We can demand better first. If that can't be met, then the last option would be to split off. While it's still possible to work together, it would not be in the best interest of everyone to cause a schism.
