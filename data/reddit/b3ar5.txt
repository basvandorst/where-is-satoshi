I’ll let you continue thinking hard about this serious issue of great importance...

Sometimes people correct project into the future and say, “I’m probably gonna regret this later...” so maybe it’s possible to regret a future event?

Bitter? Hm? Why would you think that? It’s just not even close to being a valuable discussion. Mildly interesting for a few seconds, but that’s it. If you like thinking more about it, that’s coo...I won’t interrupt bro.

That doesn’t sound like tax avoidance (legal) to me; it sounds like tax evasion (illegal). The possibilities of crypto currency are certainly interesting, but the idea that “low-quality government services” will be replaced by “voluntarily funded organizations” that will somehow automatically do better simply because it’s not da gubmint sounds a bit naive to me.  I think there would be trade-offs no matter what Body is in charge of regulation, etc. 
Personally, and despite the many examples of the weaknesses of any government, I’m not sure what you’re talking about translates as progress.  There are so many things that just wouldn’t exist had we not organized ourselves (here in the US, at least) so that we could elect representatives, etc. I see that history as the groundwork that has been laid to produce our flawed, but free society. Like any good citizen, I avoid paying any taxes that I don’t absolutely have to, but the taxes I do pay, I pay happily even though it’s frustrating sometimes to see money wasted or misspent. But the reality of the government here in the United States is that the parties and adversaries negotiate, discuss, and debate back-and-forth all so that we can slowly (I’m times very slowly) improve the system. Interesting points though!

What happened in the end, if I may ask?
