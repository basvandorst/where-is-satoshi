Taxes have absolutely nothing to do with the laws that Sal Mansy violated.

His name is "BillTheCommunistCat".
I strongly suggest people follow the laws in their jurisdiction. Your own liberty is more important than some libertarian ideal.

And I'm not a libertarian, I just believe in the great system of capitalism we have in America.

I wouldn't be so sure about that, William. Having a business allows you to get a lot more creative with taxes. Deductions, keeping money within the business and only paying income taxes on your salary, etc. The primary reason to skirt FinCEN laws would be to avoid giving the government information about your trading activity.

This has nothing to do with taxes. He's guilty of trading bitcoins OTC without filing with the Department of Treasury as a money service business. There was some uncertainty for years about whether or not OTC bitcoin traders needed to register as an MSB and follow applicable AML/KYC regulations. 
The wise ones played it safe and followed the complex laws in this space. People like Mansy who thought they were untouchable are now paying the price.
You're a communist? If you don't like America's capitalistic society, go move to Venezuela. I hear their economy is doing great.

Encryption prevents loss of bitcoins due to physical theft. It won't help you against an evil maid attack, but that's a much smaller risk for most people.

How many critical vulnerabilities will we have to see across every hardware wallet before people realize that they are an awful solution for storing bitcoins?

Ever heard of encryption?
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:25:25
Hardware wallets are useless against attackers with physical access.
