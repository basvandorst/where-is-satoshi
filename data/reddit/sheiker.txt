Quick question about anonymity
Let's say I want to hypotetically buy something anonymously on the internet, I bought btc on a website made for this, where are my personal infos, now I transfer those btc in my brd bwallet and then I use it to make my payment.
Now I didn't enter any private info in BRD, this is just a wallet, but as I downloaded it from the Play store where I'm not anonymous, will my transaction be anonymous?
I'm a Bitcoin noob.

Hey thanks for helping,
BRD wallet is an app, it's a simple wallet, you do not have to register with your name or anything. Just set a pin and answers security questions and you're good.
So, they can trace the exchange from my brd wallet but are you sure than can see where it came from at first?
But do you think they could identify me only because I purchased the app from a source I'm logged in (play store)? I would say no, a company can't see that simply by following the btc source I guess

It has absolutely nothing to do with anarchy, but there is indeed a Mexican town that's close to anarchy and lives on its own, it's Chiapas if you're interested.

Ok so I had to learn the basics of BTC to buy something. Now it's done I can buy btc, pay, and sell them to get back Euros.
So I was wondering, how risky is it to buy a good amount of btc when they fall down and wait for them to go back up?
I mean, when it's very low, it will for sure ride up one day, no?
