They've contributeur immensely to open source in the last 15 years

You're right, it's not really a fair comparison.

Serious question, I've always wondered: when there are no more bitcoins to mine, what happens to all the miners? And without miners, what happens to transaction validation? And even if a few miners remain because of transaction fee, won't the fees be incredibly high to cover for the operation fees of the miners?

What?

If it has fees, it will never be used as money. Maybe as investment, but not as money. Why would I use something that has fees instead of cash, debit or credit? None of these three choices have fees. Even better, my CC gives me 2% cash back. Well to be fair, I do pay a 5.99$ bank fee every month, which is about 0.04$ fee per transaction for me. But that 2% cash back represents about 30$ a month.

Did you vandalize that fence?
@_date: 2016-03-02 15:57:26
That's crazy, why us a CC at all then? 
  
I did say that it's not try for everyone, but at least in the US and Canada, it's very easy to get a credit card with no fees. And debit is usually free as long as you keep a certain balance in your account

That's 2% fee.. It's absolutely dumb. Why use bitcoin at all if there is an important fee like that? People who invest in bitcoin or miners don't care, but this is a real problem for the average guy who wants to use them to buy coffee at his local coffee shop. These fees will kill the adoption by the general population

Its nothing if you make large trade. But to use as a currency, .50$ is a lot. I'm not gonna buy a 4$ coffee with .50$ fees

What is the point of Bitcoin than?  
The blockchain? Some alts have much more interesting tech...  
Storing value? The speculation aspect of it dooms it to be just a tulip mania.  
What else is it if it's not a payment solution(and it really isn't unless you are doing transaction worth 100$s+ ) 
@_date: 2016-03-02 15:40:00
Credit card, debit card usually only have fees for the merchant (I know this is not true for everyone),  and cash has no fees at all... 
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:22:36
Maybe 1 or 2 dollars to pay for a coffee is stupid. And how often do you need to transfer ladder sums of money worldwide? If you dealing with that kind of money, a wire transfer was doing a fine job
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:12:03
With the transaction fee, it's a pretty bad advice to use it as a currency
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:06:57
Man, I dont even fully understand the issue, I'm not sure which side I'm on. But you long post showing so much bias and a strong agenda tells me I shouldn't be on your side

Interesting, If I map my home network it's actually more complex than that.

Im not american, why would these idiots get my info
@_date: 2017-04-01 15:54:17
Payment method with a .50$ transaction fee.... 
@_date: 2017-04-17 13:40:29
For a 100$, there are better solutions than Bitcoin. Sure it's less expensive than wire but Wire would be really stupid for such a small amount. It's really not an argument.  
What about etransfer or whatever variation you have in the state or paypal  , venmo, square cash.... Much faster and predictable fees
 
@_date: 2017-04-22 05:16:43
Sucks  
  
Edit : I can't really make that joke seriously
@_date: 2017-04-01 19:30:10
So you regularly transfer 10k across the world but worry about about wire transfer fees or the 1.50$ email transfer fees. Most people cant save up 10k in their lifetime. Anyways, that's beside the point, the ability to transfer large sums at a reasonable cost is not a payment system

Lived in India for 7 months a few years back. I wish Bitcoin was a thing then 
@_date: 2016-10-08 19:56:00
Seriously, it's true they look  a bit off, but at this point it's just a baseless accusation
@_date: 2017-05-13 17:17:10
Sure, transfer a few Satoshi with a 55,000 saoshi fee
