If a coin doesn't handle the so-called "attack" well, it is more than likely it has no real utility/value/application. People who understand the value of a particular project won't be easily convinced by some media loon who has no clue what 99% of blockchain projects do. No one can help you if you believe the bitcoin's current price fairly reflects its utility. There are dozens of crypto coins and blockchain apps that are far more valuable than bitcoin, yet they cost mere pennies. If a crypto enthusiast changes his belief on a particular subject due to some media influence it suggests that he/she has no real/valid/rational reason behind his/her investment. Lack of confidence in a particular coin implies 2 things: you don't understand exactly its utility or you understand its weaknesses to the point where you have not enough confidence to invest. Real value in crypto is a myth as of now, speculative bubble has taken the bitcoin to a different realm. Newbie investors are perpetuating the bubble, it is a serious trouble. Bitcoin is worth around $11k, yet Ether only $1k and Neo $130. How is it reasonable? If you perhaps could educate me, I would really appreciate it.

Totally agree, having a clear reason for the market's recent downtrend is a very rare event in crypto. People should use this opportunity.
