Apparently, in spring 2017, the Bulgarian government seized 213,519 BTCs belonging to a network of cyber criminals.
No one really knows if the seized Bitcoins have been resold or if it is still into the Bulgarian government hands...

A prediction to consider but more distant and less precise than Milton Friedman's

Dear  globalistas  
When using bitcoin to pay at the point-of-sale or for a face-to-face transaction, there is the problem of how to communicate the Bitcoin address to be paid in a way that the person paying can use.
A bitcoin address is just data, but it is between 27 and 34 characters so that is way to much info to expect the person paying to have to manually type in.
A QR code can easily represent this amount of data in a machine-readable manner and do so reliably. The QR code can contain other information as well -- such as an amount and a message and other fields as well

It's not valid QR code, it's just for fun  ��

Since then, the QR-Code has come a long way, especially since the appearance of smartphones and social networks...

Chinese investors return to Bitcoin with Yuan being second entry FIAT currency. What you think about the surprising third entry currency?
