What's the consensus on changing the algo to make CPU mining feasible again?

Wait a second, what's a full node? 
I'm running bitcoind on my Debian server, but not doing any business on that machine. Is that what's called a "full node" ?

Nah-uh. Blurring is reversible. Look up 2D deconvolution for specifics.

Misleading headline is misleading. Gates did not say that Bitcoin is better than currency *in general*.


Not that I want to disturb the circlejerk. By all means, carry on.
@_date: 2015-01-23 19:02:49
If you say so. Bill Gates think Bitcoin is better than currency. That's cool.

I'm not invested enough to care, I'll just keep using whatever's in my distro's repo, although I kind of agree with the increased block size limit.
However things may go, he should keep in mind that laziness will have a major effect on which client people will use.

Maybe it's not a good joke if I have to explain it, but I meant that that the higher the price of bitcoin, the more people might be interested in that paper. So the value is bound to stay the same in BTC.
I'M NOT IMPLYING THAT THERE IS A SHADOW GOVERNMENT REGULATING THE PRICE OF VINTAGE NEWSPAPER ISSUES THROUGH GLOBAL SCALE MIND CONTROL!

Another bad joke?
It's 2017!
@_date: 2017-01-03 23:41:23
The value of that issue is and always will be 1BTC :)

2016? OP, why don't you go back further into the past! Don't forget your ASIC miner!  
@_date: 2016-02-02 01:17:13
Hiring assassins. Because that's how good guys act.
@_date: 2016-10-13 15:26:07


Which of the two do you consider Bitcoin to be?
@_date: 2016-05-12 12:06:11
And ~~Iron Man~~ ***War Machine*** == ASIC mining rig?
@_date: 2015-10-22 06:07:19
They is alright!

Spending the coins reveals the decryption keys. They will be in the blockchain.

It's probalbly time you cleared your browser cache.

Absolutely fucking not.
A Free, open source decentralized taxi/"ridesharing" service would be awesome however.
Edit: on second thought, cars are probably going to be driving themselves well before such a system gains traction
Edit 2: the downvotes might be justified for my rash outburst. I'll clarify my point: uber isn't the btc of taxiing. Uber is the central banking of taxiing.

Running a full node means you download and run the official bitcoin program instead of using a web wallet methinks. 
@_date: 2016-05-24 15:56:49
It's so much simpler to just stand up and walk away without paying. Why would anyone even bother to go to such lengths as doublespending coins is beyond me. Maybe if they can't run so fast, okay.
@_date: 2015-02-03 11:03:30
That's a good point. I don't see how there could be a way around that.
@_date: 2015-02-19 13:50:23
And you salt it with...?
