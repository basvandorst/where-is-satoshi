It was moved to another address by the creator. Still on
@_date: 2018-05-22 01:43:18
The frequency of the words scales them larger is how I understood it.
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:11:12
I was under the impression that the reward was moved to a new address because the creator decided to remove the passphrase step. If that's the case then your seed is a valid one but just not to the right address.

Maybe it's another famous one but I thought it was checked every 6 months.
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:56:54
That one I believe.
@_date: 2018-05-26 17:21:39
If the clues the creator provided are bip39 words that are actually part of the puzzle then it seems more likely that it would be 24 words. That and think in pairs can be interpreted as a pair of 12 words.

tl;dr not gonna die, don't have time to post any of my ideas. 
Had time to post that novel though. hmm

The thing about this is they sell a physical poster copy of this puzzle.
@_date: 2018-05-22 17:34:45
You would think so since they sell a poster of it for $300.
@_date: 2018-05-28 05:54:48
Nice of you to do this :)
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:08:26
What's with the cryptic garbage? You're not the puzzle creator afaik. There's the main prize and supposedly some consolation prizes that people are trying to get. 
The only other "diamonds" you elude to is perhaps a better understanding of how cryptos work.
@_date: 2018-05-27 17:31:39
There is a lambda character in the picture though.
@_date: 2018-05-23 02:13:29
Ralph C. Merkle I think

funds are safe 
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:58:39
Are we trying to manually come up with 11 or 23 words because the last word is a checksum? It's the only thing that has me confused. I saw some talk on this earlier in the thread but nothing I considered conclusive.
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:16:30
I counted 26 words.
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:17:26
You don't. There's two steps, 1) You have nothing 2) You have one BTC.
@_date: 2018-05-31 03:15:14
How can you tell it was from him? 
@_date: 2018-05-31 07:49:49
For what it's worth I didn't downvote, just asked the question. All four of those transactions add up to 60 cents USD, it could be anyone just having some fun. "Let's see how many take the bait."

So it's your opinion that the wordcloud site was used and then the image was rearranged afterwards?
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:18:30
It's one of two things. Either the creator unknowingly made it ridiculously hard (explains the rapid fire hints and adjustment of difficulty) or the simple solution is being completely overlooked because people are expecting something that's a certain level of complexity.
@_date: 2018-05-27 18:57:52
That's assuming it wasn't auto generated with  and the words were chosen afterwards.
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:51:06
Yeah some things he's said are marked as clues and others aren't.
@_date: 2018-05-26 05:05:56


I've not been able to recreate this after many attempts.
@_date: 2018-05-27 02:26:33
Quite possible since it is their first attempt. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 23:18:24
@_date: 2018-05-27 02:24:01
Most people have been using this one:
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:36:09
Ah. The circle cuts out the clue "almost open" and if "code easily, attack early" is in fact a clue, it cuts that out as well.
@_date: 2018-05-27 04:50:05
Trying to solve it. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 01:10:53
Yeah that's my guess as well.
@_date: 2018-06-02 21:27:09
funds are safe
@_date: 2018-06-08 23:26:07
What's more confusing and possibly sending people after red herrings are the comments that weren't labelled as clues but not denied as such.
@_date: 2018-06-09 18:39:41
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:55:13
I don't think anyone should definitively count the infinity comment as a bonus clue. It could've also been deleted because it misleading.
@_date: 2018-06-09 22:35:39
While it's generally frowned upon, you can pick your own words for a seed phase.
@_date: 2018-06-18 21:21:39
The prize was moved so I'm pretty sure that rules out private key
@_date: 2018-06-17 15:19:30
"P &lt; 0.001" - Section 11 of the whitepaper. Punctuation is removed by the wordcloud.
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:23:40
I can only find the one that took 3 years and it was worth 5x as much.
@_date: 2018-06-09 05:06:32
If you have the correct seed phrase then there is no need to contact the OP, you can just take the btc
