Bitcoin is more expensive than my bank currently.  Why not just increase the block size to get the fee down to a reasonable price at least for now?

Communist china probably controls all the bitcoin mining operations... Also everyone can stop name calling cause BTC is now operable at 6 sat/byte transactions so calm yourself and go spend bitcoin btc and bch or repent.

Competition is really healthy for the ecosystem isn't it?

On the contrary, I've got 10-15% discounts on Purse.IO to get amazon orders.  So, it is already possible to not hodl ;)

It is dangerous for the banks.  The banks want bitcoin to stay at high fees so it cant compete with them.

The hope is that there will be huge volume at the point when all coins are mined.  This will require people using it as money basically and not hodling all of it.

But on another note emergency savings is crucial for everyone.

Yeah :( 
The first step to getting out of debt though is getting an emergency savings.  I'd highly recommend Dave Ramsey's programs.
