Oh damn you got me! 
It’s always tough when someone busts out an intelligent counter-point like this. 
Well done
@_date: 2018-06-12 12:55:36
I don’t disagree, I just don’t know. 
Why would this make BTC mote valuable and not say just the Euro?
@_date: 2018-06-12 12:56:54
If Amazon offered a discount for paying in Bitcoin I would guess that would help!

Maybe Dennis Rodman could help with this, I mean he seems qualified…

Nail meet head
Well done

Obligatory “nobody really knows these are all guesses” 
For the time period I agree December was a bubble. 
If you look at the first bubble and pull back in the lower left of the chart, The rise and fall around Dec ‘17 looks very similar if you zoom out. 
Nothing is ever the biggest or record breaking thing until it is. Some believe Crypto Currency and possibly Bitcoin (which I believe) will be the biggest innovation of the this generation (attributing the internet to the previous generation).  Now here is where I’m crazy, I believe decentralized currency like Bitcoin will be the most beneficial innovation the world has ever seen. 
So I believe we are in the infancy of this crazy, wonderful thing

Until you make provide anything other than an Ad Hominem argument I’ll assume you can’t think for yourself

Freedom to have my currency under my control. Banks and government control any currency you have in the bank, and how it is transported and exchanged. 
Centralized currency is by nature exposed to being confiscated or having its access restricted. 
Decentralized currency is exactly the opposite. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:02:35
Greece: the entire point is that the people don’t have control over their money. Bitcoin cannot be withheld from someone who owns it, you understand that right? The fact that there is a finite amount and it is decentralized means it can’t disappear. 
1. I’ll make it simple, with one letter all of your monetary assets that are not held in cash by a person physically, can be frozen by the government. So no it’s not fundamentally misguided. 
2. The government acts in its long term interest not the people’s.  The USD could absolutely experience hyper-inflation, due to a few events happening at the same time. Let’s hope the US doesn’t experience a bank run and have significant portion of our debt not be reissued, and a large scale war. 
3. Bitcoin can be anonymous, it also can be traced, depending on how you use it. With the ability to exchange it for other cryptocurrencies and the advent of the LN it certainly can be anonymous. As for fiat cash, it’s only anonymous when you have it in physical form outside of the system. The nature of the design of a centralized monetary system like the US, or any other major country, that physical currency will be put back into the system and be tracked. And then is under the control of the government again, that’s what I’m worried about. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:36:19
Yes that’s the surface answer. But what I see as the bigger conversation is about why certain things are illegal and how the money that is tracked. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:11:55
1. Yes, I can carry any amount I choose without legal repercussions. 
2. It cannot be artificially inflated by a centralized source because there is a finite amount. The fact that it can change value has no bearing not this argument. Any negotiable item is only worth what someone else will pay for it, literally everything of value is only with what another party will put for it. 
3. Yes is the US it is all available to the government it is all tracked an reported. 
4. Greece blocked withdrawals from banks in 2015, the money that was supposedly owned by the citizens was not allowed to be withdrawn. A decentralized cryptocurrency cannot be controlled by a centralized force. That’s the point. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 01:30:36
I’ve never stated I was intelligent. 
The problem with monetary  oversight is this:
1. You have no control, what you believe is control is an illusion. 
2. Because it is centrally controlled, your money has only the value the controlling body allows it to. 
3. Everything you choose to transact is logged and can be used in whatever way suits whoever has access to it. 
4. Greece in 2015, if that doesn’t scare you I don’t know what does. 
I mean I could go one but what’s the point. We disagree. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:22:12
And you are again not answering anything. Before you respond that I’m parroting the FAQ go read my comments. We talk specifically about a few different situations. 
Do you have the ability to provide an answer, or do you only know how to vaguely criticize?
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:33:32
I disagree. It has a lot to do with taxation and government control. That then leads to what is legal and why. Which often is a conversation that is actually about who gets what money not necessarily what is best for the people at large. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:12:49
Yup that’s the side of control that is a benefit but what we give up is more detrimental in my opinion. 
Freedom and Privacy. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:16:19
Nope 5,000 would not be the DCA of that example…
(1,000 + 10,000) / 2 = 5,500
It’s like… math 
@_date: 2018-02-22 01:08:27
This is a good question, anybody know the answer to this?
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:42:57
The question is why do we allow the government to have such a large amount of control and oversight of our currency?
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:34:52
You watch those crypto discussion on Reddit? You see the one about HODLers? You got this HODLer. He’s the true believer in the technology, huge amount of patience out to here. He’s laying under a see of information, in the middle of Internet. He’s so big, it’s so hot. He doesn’t want to move. Now the little traders come, they start messing with him. Biting his tail, biting his ears. He doesn’t do anything. The nocoiner, she starts messing with him. Coming over, making trouble. Still nothing. Now the other noobs and non-believers, they notice this. They start to move in. The Weak Hands; FUDsters. They’re barking at him, laughing at him. They nip his toes, and eat the food that’s in his domain. They do this, then they get closer and closer, bolder and bolder. Till one day, that HODLer gets up and tears the shit out of everybody. Runs like the wind, buys all the Bitcoin in his path. Cause every once in a while, the HODLer has to show everyone, who he is.
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:15:38
Constructive... Do you have a counterpoint?
@_date: 2018-02-11 00:37:51
Great rebuttal. I could use large obscure terms that are more difficult to understand and grasp if you’d like. 
The fact that you don’t question the amount of oversight the government has in our life (monetary regulation is just one form) would lead me to believe you are not a person who questions the status quo. 
You sound brainwashed
@_date: 2018-02-11 01:32:56
Another well thought out response. Find a counterpoint and we can have an discussion. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:37:46
This is a perfect example of when you have the chance to make and support an actual stance. Instead you make an accusatory statement with no position on the matter. 
All you are doing is throwing stones. Let’s have a conversation. I may be wrong. And my logic may be flawed. But your response does nothing to further the conversation. 
I will and have supported everything I have said with actual examples and my own opinions. 
What constructive point or argument have you provided to this? Nothing that I can see. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:44:02
Hard to have a conversation with someone unwilling to be open. 
If these people who disagree would provide an actual basis for their position we could make progress, but they revert to attacks. 
I don’t get the mentality of arguing to win, why not have a conversation to progress?
