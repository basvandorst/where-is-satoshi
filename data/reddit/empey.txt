The likelihood for another dip below 3k is there, and it's big unless the structure changes for the upside. I've been practicing Elliott Wave only for about 9 months, before that I spent a year studying everything about technical analysis and found out it was complete crap and nothing works as good as Elliott Wave so don't waste your time with learning anything except EW. Also if you want to learn more about waves you should google Anil Mangal, he will definitely change the way you look at charts and perhaps you might thank me one day lol.
I am actually waiting for Ethereum to drop below $200, possibly to $130 area before any major long investment, it should happen within the month unless something changes about the structure.

If you're wrong you're not in the trade or you're out for break even, but if you're right you're in the trade. EW is a tool that helps you find the direction of the moving trend, you are the one who has to come up with a strategy for entries.

Not here to convince you but cryptos aren't an exception to mass psychological behavior of the investors showing up in the charts and constructing recognizable patterns out of it, history repeats itself and not only in the markets ;)

News don't move the market, they just add to the volatility.
Investors are the ones that influence the price movement and their mass psychological behavior is reflected in chart patterns which are repeated over and over, you can study them and be able to catch some really nice trades instead of hodling and hoping for the best.
Not here to convince you or anything that's just my 2 cents.

Heading for a 5th impulsive wave down. I trade the Elliott Wave Theory and no matter what major news happens , the markets react in the same predictable way.

The long term upside will start after we dip another time towards 3k, mid term we might touch 4.2k but I doubt it.
After the dip btc will break 5k.

Sorry to say that but we have to make a dip under $3k before we see any significant new highs in BTC.
the thing with moving averages / support and resistances is just a mere coincidence my friend.
