I think the FAQ page is great but there's just so much information there that it's impenetrable to new users. There's no way to know which information you need now, and what you can learn later on.
I'd say having a page for "Newcomers FAQ" and then a "Even more FAQs" would be good.

It is well known that there are no Monetary Units in use in the Galaxy.
In fact there are three freely convertible currencies in the Galaxy, but none of them count. The Altarian Dollar has recently collapsed, the Flainian Pobble Bead is only exchangeable for other Flainian Pobble Beads, and the Triganic Pu has its own very special problems. It exchange rate of eight Ningis to one Pu is simple enough, but since Ningi is a triangular rubber coin six thousand eight hundred miles along each side, no one has ever collected enough to own one Pu. Nigis are not negotiable currency, because Galactibanks refuse to deal in fiddling small change. From this basic premise it is very simple to prove that the Galactibanks are also the product of a deranged imagination.

Sorry for the stupid questions, I'm trying to get my head around this...
Do coinbase/bitpay POS clients not require blockchain confirmations to 'confirm' the transaction to the recipient? So that's how they do it quickly?
Is there any way to know how much time a zero fee transaction would take? Are we talking minutes or hours or days? I'm imagining the conversation:

Just before Christmas I was going to buy a gift from Amazon via gyft with my btc profits but I didnt want to convert £50 over my requirement from BTC-&gt;'Amazon voucher' and have it stuck there.
Instead, I sold my required amount on localbitcoin for a little extra profit. Problem: The guy never responded and my BTC was stuck in escrow for 12 or 24 hours (can't remember) and during that time the value tanked (I'm pretty sure he ignored it as he saw the value going down but was actively online).

I'm not sure I get this one. I don't see how medical research is 'centralised' now, other than people potentially hoarding their results but I think that's a lack of pressure from the funding bodies and the community to open results.
And while the FDA are conservative in allowing things through to the market, I'd definitely disagree that the prevent all progress. They're the only thing that's stopping something like the Thalidomide incident happening again (at the extreme end). The patent system is outdated, but that's not a medical issue alone.
Maybe I'm missing your point though.

(I'm being the naive Devil's Advocate here because I don't fully understand)
For example, when Greece got into financial trouble they weren't able to 'print more money' to pay people to work because they were tied to the Euro and they got stuck in a downward spiral until they got bailouts.
If they could inflate their currency couldn't they artificially boost the economy and work their way out? I see why it's better to not need to do that, but in this situation wouldn't it help?

Despite speculation on a few forums, there has been no data breach of names or emails at Coinbase.  We wanted to take this opportunity to address any concerns.
Specifically with regard to the ‘request money’ feature of Coinbase, it is highly inaccurate to suggest that names or emails were leaked or that there has been a breach.  Our new Director of Security Ryan McGeehan responded accordingly in our whitehat responsible reporting tool.  Here are the high level points:
**Requesting money as spam**
It is intentional that Coinbase users are able to send invoices to an arbitrary number of email addresses.  Allowing lists to be invoiced is core functionality of our service, and this functionality is intentionally built into our API, which is rate limited:
This process simply sends an email with a request. It does not initiate any bitcoin transfer without confirmation from the recipient, and would not be any more effective than more traditional phishing methods, which we spend a considerable amount of time preventing.
**Email address / user enumeration on Coinbase**
It’s important to note that using an email address to determine if someone has an account on a service is the norm across most internet sites today. You’ll find that user enumeration is possible on Facebook, Google, Dropbox, and nearly every other major internet site.
You’ll also find many leading payment services allow user enumeration, including Paypal, Venmo, Square Cash, and many others.  One simply needs to try sending or requesting money using one of these services to an email address to see this in action.  The name of the user or business will be revealed on the next step.
Using user names in our service is an important component in providing a positive and responsive user experience. And to be clear - a sender would need your email address in advance to be able to send you a request for money.
We’ve spent a good amount of time investigating this behavior and we believe that the risks are minor.
**Information disclosure of coinbase accounts (first and last name)**
For individuals who list a name, our product and Privacy Policy make it explicitly clear that this contact information can be displayed - and in turn, make Coinbase a more human user experience.
We’d also like to address the claim of a “leaked” list of Coinbase emails and user names.  This list (the size of which is less than one half of one percent of Coinbase users) was not the result of a data breach at Coinbase.  This list of emails was likely sourced from other sites - probably Bitcoin related ones.  It’s clear there was no data breach because no other user information is provided.
Though we believe this type of spam and user enumeration activity doesn’t represent a significant risk to Coinbase customers, we absolutely recognize that it can be an inconvenience and cause confusion.  We have already implemented a number of things which make this type of activity less convenient for would-be spammers.  For example, we employ rate limits around sensitive actions, such as requesting money, to prevent them from being abused at scale.  We’re fine tuning this existing rate limiting to make it more restrictive.  To those who have received spammy requests, we apologize.
We are continually striving to make Coinbase as safe and secure as possible for all of our users, and in the coming weeks, we will perform a more extensive overview of the existing controls we have in place to see how they can be improved.
We will continue to update this blog post as more information is made available.  As always, if you have any questions or concerns about the security of your account please visit us at  .

The new hive app is a fucking joke. I used their original one for the last year or so, but then when my phone broke I intended to load my wallet into it from the backup.
Firstly, it's USD only, no bitcoin unit choices, loads of loss-of-function.
Also, it turns out they now have two wallets on the play store: "Hive Bitcoin Wallet" and "Hive Wallet". Same logo and everything. No indication that one is better or worse than the other. I struggled trying to load my backup in before being told on their github issue tracker (They don't have an email address) that the old backups are non compatible. I had to install the old app and send my coins to mycelium where they now sit happily.

1 Bitcoin is quite large, so people often deal in smaller units although there's not a universal unit agreed upon at the moment:
Value | Unit | Info
 mBitcoin / mBits | 1,000 in a bitcoin | SI unit for milli i.e. millilitre (ml) or millimeter (mm)
 μBitcoin / μBits | 1,000,000 in a bitcoin | SI unit for micro i.e microlitre (μl) or micrometre (μm)
 bits | 1,000,000 in a bitcoin | Colloquial term with the same value as μBits
 Satoshi | 100,000,000 in a bitcoin | The smallest unit of bitcoin, named after the inventor
For example, assuming an exchange rate of $500 for one Bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:
* 0.02 BTC
* 20 mBTC
* 20,000 bits or μBits

Their website started accepting it a few weeks ago and then it disappeared until now. Probably a trial. It was discussed in @_date: 2014-07-07 21:29:34
Sorry if I'm being stupid, but isn't one of the major advantages of bitcoin being able to do quick incredibly cheap transfers?
Isn't this fee increase going to kill off small businesses acceptance, where the major advantage was the lack of card fees? Or the changetip bot where people send 10 cents at a time?

localbitcoins is probably what you want then. It's like personal ads for bitcoin.
But on the downside, it's like personal ads... Gotta make sure you're not buying something that 'fell off the back of a truck' and you're probably going to pay a couple of % higher than if you go to real company like coinbase.

I'm trying to understand this...
What if I went into a shop, bought lunch for $10 of BTC. I doubt the store owner would accept zero confirmations, but then either me or him would end up paying 10% of the cost, no?
@_date: 2014-07-07 21:54:22
I can see how that would work for people constantly trading, but for example, if I went to the market and the vegetable guy accepted bitcoin I imagine one of three things has to happen:
* me or him would have to pay/lose, say $1,
* we stand around for half an hour,
* he has to trust that he will get his money later through a third party off-chain system?
Am I understanding this right? Because one of the best ways I've been introducing people to bitcoin is asking friends if they want me to pay them back for pizza (or whatever) with £5 of bitcoin to see what it's all about. It's sounding like this would kill the 'digital cash' which I thought was what bitcoin is all about.

I'd still prefer to get it right first time because I don't know whether the software these guys are using would check that, or whether they'd just get a "bitcoin sent, throw the customer out now" message.

I agree that a 1 satoshi minimum is a bit silly though. Maybe a lower limit of around 10 bits (almost half a USD cent) to avoid spam.

Well from 's comment below, his 12% was probably worth about $10k at the time of sale. I don't know if anyone could put a total value on mtgox to say what that would be worth at the peak.

"The Chancellor is to launch a review to assess how the UK could become a leading global centre for Bitcoin and other virtual currencies."
George Osborne has instructed Treasury officials to work on a study looking at the benefits and threats of digital currencies, which remain unregulated.
The study, expected in the Autumn, will scope out the potential for cryptocurrencies, and their role in business and society, in the context of the overall financial system

Ok, so am I reading this right?
Basically, the hashrate (number of people mining) increased really quickly over the last period, but now the difficulty has gone up it's leveled off.
Would this relate to flooding the market with new coins which have to be sold off and driving down the price? So now that the new coin supply has levelled off then we shouldn't be flooded so much?

I avoid talk of price completely when telling new people about bitcoin now.
Describe it primarily as a system for instantly transferring money globally and not owned by any government. If they find that cool then I'll offload a whole load of other info.

I know it's really shallow, but neither of these are very aesthetically pleasing. Security is number one, obviously, but mycelium still looks like it was built for Android 2.3. 
The coinbase app looks much more professional and less 'hacker' style, but it's not local. Does anyone know of a go-between?

Given that they're a store that buys and sells phones/tablets, I can't believe they don't have a system in place for this. Maybe just because it's new.
