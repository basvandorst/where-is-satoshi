The point is that is *can* be used anonymously with enough effort, just as almost anything can.

Of course he'l be able to cash out. After the coin starts moving, there is no way to prove it is in the hands of the hacker. When people start tracking to watch where it goes, it's just more wishful thinking.

What is wrong with all you guys? let them get it up ASAP. when they know when, 2 hours notice is plenty of time for people to get their shit together! Money never sleeps
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:51:35
Not how bitcoin works. Go use paypal!
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:11:01
You just have no idea what the hell you are talking about. You think people can't launder money? You think they stole it for no reason? WTF, you are thick.
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:35:57
well, according to u/luke-jr, bitcoin is "never anonymous", maybe we should just ask him who did it?
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:12:55
or, the thief spends the coin somewhere... or tumbles them... then you are just making life harder for someone who had nothing to do with the hack. bitcoin is bitcoin, and it is fungible. Tracing it is meaningless because you have no way of knowing if he is moving to himself or to some third party who isn't involved it this.

now miners aren't part of the bitcoin community?
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:43:49
It should be a convertible token issued in the currency originally lost. I only held a small amount of USD on bfx at the time of the hack. So, if I get a token for 36% of that value in USD, I should be able to trade that for a token in BTC at market rate. I imagine it could be a long time before we are made whole, and I'd rather have that money potentially sitting in bitcoin than fiat.

Yes, it really is a piece of cake! Just because you don't know how, doesn't mean they don't. Many countries are quite lax with banking regulations. People do this all the time. Besides, they won't withdraw it all at once. It will be spread out to look more legitimate. We are talking about tens of millions of dollars. They won't mind spending what it takes to cash out properly.

"such a hardfork requires consent from the entire community" - Luke-Jr
"miners have no say in hardfork decisions." - Luke-Jr
cognitive dissonance???

you do realize that it is possible that many users have coin that likely at some point was stolen, right? just because someone has stolen coin, doesn't mean that person stole it. Bitcoin is fungible. Whoever was able to do this, is smart enough to cash-out. Besides, there are many ways to obfuscate the trail of the coins. Although there really isn't a reason to.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:58:20


it really isn't that hard if you know the right people. even doing it yourself isn't so hard. 
I know where you can move 100k a day with no ID and no questions. You are looking at this as if the person/people would want to withdraw in the States or the EU.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:23:29
It will just take them time to cash it all out, but it won't be hard.
and it's not hard to use fake identities to cash out if they want to. Although mostly not necessary.
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:15:21
Ah, I thought it would be more like an IOU
@_date: 2016-07-06 00:49:25
Yup, so easy to decloak that everyone knows who Satoshi is, right? 
Bitcoin can be anonymous as long as one removes any link to his own identity. This is not difficult to achieve. The traceability of bitcoin does not affect the possibility of anonymous usage in any way. You must simply control for entry and exit into the bitcoin economy. The only places where people usually link their identity. This part is easy to obfuscate.
@_date: 2016-07-06 23:59:30
You put to much faith in the intelligence of the masses for them to care all that much if they can't be bothered to protect their identity in almost any other case. Most people use credit/debit cards which are *directly* linked to their identity. 
The public balance issue you state is complete bunk! For someone to know the balance of my wallet, they would need to know *ALL* of my wallet's public keys.
@_date: 2016-07-07 04:33:45
and??? identity is, as I said, revealed at entry points... where, if a person makes a little effort, he can obscure his identity... 
@_date: 2016-07-06 23:19:08
You don't know if he did or is. No one does. You cannot link every address to an identity. That's the point. The tracability doesn't matter unless addresses can be directly link to identities. They can only conclusively be linked usually at entry-exit points. If I buy 1 BTC at an exchange that knows my identity, ok the exchange knows my identity. I then send that BTC to another address not controlled by the exchange. Unless that address is controlled by a third party who knows the owner's identity, the chain of custody of the bitcoin is lost. The fact that you can trace it is pretty pointless.
@_date: 2016-07-06 22:07:31
You don't need effortless anonymity for mass adoption. most people don't worry about anonymity when using the internet. They aren't gonna worry about it when using digital currency.
@_date: 2016-07-06 03:09:46
You just don't get it. It is possible to use bitcoin without ever, ever attaching your identity to it. Tracability is irrelevant. The Silk Road bust had nothing to do with the tracability of BTC.
Edit: regardless of the "anonymity" of bitcoin, almost anything *can* be used anonymously with enough effort.
@_date: 2016-07-07 15:09:14
Why the hell do you keep bringing up Monero? the argument was whether or not bitcoin can be used anonymously, not whether Monero is better. Monero does not have and will not have the network strength of bitcoin regardless of whether it's better or not. I would be the first to agree there are probably many alts better than BTC, and I agree that their are IMMENSE problems with the devs around bitcoin right now with their stubbornness, but the odds of an alt ever overtaking BTC are pretty slim, even with assholes like Luke-Jr around. I would be happy if it happens though... 
BTW, the blocksize problem has been going on for several years already, and the idiots are still claiming current hardware can't support 1MB blocks, despite the fact that blocks have been full at 1MB for over a year now without the network breaking down.
