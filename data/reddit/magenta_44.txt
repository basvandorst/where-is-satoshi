Bitcoin To Muffins

Soon, we'll witness the halvening, and most probably the new ath, so it's nice to keep btc for the long time, especially now. Owning at least one BTC is a nice investment, but for example with my current financial situation it's a risk (if something would happen to that btc, stolen or smth) i can take. Long-term has been always the most profitable for me so keep hodling - also have a nice day :&gt;

imo it's a poor meme, but i don't want to ruin fun anyone

it doesn't even make sense, it's been decades since the dollar detached from national gold reserve

Wow, that's the best btc meme i've seen today

the best way is to not use any emotions when it comes to money

If I had only one Bitcoin I would hodl it as long as I can

most of the centralized exchanges are doing such stuff, mostly because every change of financial payment operator (a bank usually) requires new verfications
