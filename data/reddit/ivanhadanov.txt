I wrote 1997 not 1999. There was a huge difference between 1997 and 1999 due to the speed of adoption. I got on to the net in '97 and I was considered a late early adopter. Having the net and a computer was still a somewhat of a fad but to be even more accurate you could compare the net in '95 vs as you say where it was in '05 for potential but because we have the net ubiquity should happen that much quicker
If you want to get even more picky about it you could say internet video in '97 vs. today
and BTC only needs an 'app' that will let it convert to whatever the winning tech is in the future. It only needs to survive at this point. I wouldn't bet all my eggs on it though, that is not prudent

They don't care about the price. They want to milk the market for cash like a farmer milks a cow for milk.
As long as people panic and give them money when it drops and then buy in when it begins to rally, they will continue to do this. Human nature (fear and greed), unfortunately, works in a contrarian pattern to prices. They buy high and sell low following the crowd to their own financial peril. The pros in the market know this which is why they have been doing this, to great success, for over a hundred years

That is the angle I am using to all the naysayers. It is also why PM Theresa May saying Britain will ban bitcoin is absurd.

Or this:
You have a drycleaning shop that you saved your whole life for and paid with cash. 
For your first profit of $1000, you put it in the bank. The bank turns around and loans out $1000 to nine other dry cleaners to start businesses thus creating artificial competition for you FROM YOUR OWN MONEY! Because there are too many businesses doing the same thing, you all go broke and the bank forecloses on all your properties at pennies on the dollar.
All their losses are either written off against past and future profits, they sit on nine lots of property ready to sell to the next sucker that comes along, and, if they really get into trouble, they go crying to momma government for a bailout
Or here is another one:
You go to the banker because you want to buy a $300K house. He says that he can only loan you the money if you put your $30,000 life savings on as a down payment.
So you say deal because you don't know any better.
So a few years down the road, you have paid off $20,000 or so on your mortgage, a ton of interest plus maintenance and property tax etc. Then you lose your job to a robot.
A few months later the bank forecloses.
After you have taken all the risk, what happens? The banker captures your down payment, all the interest payments you paid for many months, the $20k equity you saved and, because the house was only worth $200K when it was foreclosed on, you are forced into bankruptcy.
So for the privilege of borrowing from the bank, you get your life wiped out.
Now, what does the bank lose? It doesn't. It gets your $200K house, your equity, months of interest payments. But, you say, they lost money on the house. But, they didn't because they can write any losses off against future profits. If too many losses occur they can go to the government for a bailout.

Attention shoppers:
"Now departing first adopters phase"
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:42:28
I think it has the potential to do to currency and transactions what the internet did for the democratization of information
Before, the media gatekeepers basically controlled the information flow and restricted what we saw and learned (yes kids, it was really like that before the internet). This is what the banks and CBs do now with credit markets and international trade and transactions. If things get out of hand they have the ability to restrict credit and capital flows. I don't think they will be able to do that with the crypto currencies. They can try but the cryptos can go 'off grid'
The big question is will BTC be the one at the heart of it or will there be a greater crypto to take its place?
I think that with the USGov securitizing BTC like they are starting to now, they have studied BTC and they are either trying to control it or they are moving to some sort of plan B. So I think BTC has won the first 'battle' but never let your guard down on the elites because they think in 100 year time frames
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:10:29
You probably won't see any significant stability until BTC gets into  the 500b - 1T$ range for its market cap and the law of large numbers takes over. BTC should function as a payment processor to the world. It will be competing with the likes of paypal, the credit cards and the banks. That is a huge market and BTC needs to be quite large to compete smoothly and effectively. 
That adds up to a BTC price of over $50K and until that and the general public makes it a household name like mastercard, you should see some large fluctuations
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:26:37
worst case scenario is that we are still in the first adopters phase. Either way, it is all good ;)

Advise them to go with 5% of their net worth if they are interested. At 5% you can have nice gains but if the investment tanks, then it is not too hard a hit to take. Since many believe that BTC will go to $50K in value, that 5% is over tenfold return and that will make it 33% of their net worth yet their risk is only 5%. 
A 10 to 1 risk reward is incredible in the investing world and it is the type of risk that will let you sleep at night

True enough. This is the free market at work. This is something we probably haven't seen anywhere in the world since the '90's thanks to central bank manipulation. Many of us are brainwashed not to be comfortable with this kind of volatility but I think it is healthy
The market is going through price discovery which is what a free market is supposed to do. We are currently in a trading 'debate' as to the value of BTC and it is a blood sport. This will shake out the weak gamblers and put the price determination into the strong hands
I've also seen one example of a site (betting) that is not valuing the bets in $ any more but entirely in BTC because the exchange was killing their profit margin. So you come in with BTC, you bet with BTC and you leave with BTC. 
I think we will see more of this where certain networks will work and price their goods entirely in BTC and (as Gresham's law) drive out the $ altogether. I can't quite get my head around how that is going to work, maybe a BTC barter network or something but that is one solution I think the commercials will come up with
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:35:58
I think BTC will take its place like one of the payment processors. Competing with a credit card like Visa and mastercard or something like paypal. Most of those are in the 200 billion range. So I think it is a safe bet  the market cap for btc can hit the  $1 trillion range (about $50K per BTC) since they will apply to many more transactions (like people who are too poor to get credits cards)

No, what I'm saying is that people hold for the wrong reasons. Most people hold because they are waiting for the price to go back up but if you truly thought that, you would buy more.
There are times you would hold but they are fewer than the average trader would assume. The only time you should really hold is if you honestly thought it won't go down more but then you should buy more if you can beat the opportunity cost on another investment or are not keeping up with inflation. If you are not able to do that then you are going to lose money and you should sell. You need to realize you are already at a loss when you are thinking of holding at that point but fear of losing more is interfering with your ability to get a good return in that time
You fall into the fear mindset when you write what you write. 
I'm not saying it is easy. I fall victim to it too. I'm just trying to show people their thinking is probably wrong at certain points and thus they need to change either their thinking or strategies to compensate for that

You are proving my point.
Yes, I agree about position sizes (if you are trading you don't have one 'stake') and you need to trade for the fact that you will make mistakes but at the end of the day you need to boil it down to the simple up, down or sideways and prepare for those contingencies
The psychology of trading comes into play when certain things happen. This exercise is to get you to think the right way when those things happen or at least to understand your emotions at that point and how you might be thinking wrong. Wrong thinking leads to bad trading
And BTW, market studies show that when a stock regains its original price after a drop that becomes a resistance point because many traders have broken even and 'just want their money back'. People feel loss twice as sharply as they feel gain so breaking even is a huge relief to many

Just because it has no economic value does not mean it doesn't have infinite utilitarian value
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:21:26
You should trade that 1/3. Choose a price range or trading increments of a few hundred dollars (I'd recco $200 - $500. So $4200btc, $4400btc, $4600btc etc.), divide your 1/3 stake into about 10 pieces and then trade the increments. That way you have your base block and you are forcing yourself to buy low and sell high. 
As the price moves higher shift your range higher. You still will have made money off your big block and you can create cash flow from your trading stake or you can use that cash flow to add to your base

If you truly felt it would drop more and had conviction about it you would sell. That is the smart move from a purely mathematical perspective. If you don't feel confident then as you say you would hold. This just tells you what your conviction is and gives you more ability to discern what your true belief is about the price. It gets you more in touch with how you feel about the price emotionally and thus should help you to trade better
@_date: 2017-09-09 23:38:00
The key is not to trade it all. Keep half or two thirds your stake as a hodl and then trade the rest. That way if it takes off, you make money on the block you hodl and you aren't concerned if you have money left on the table.
Keep in mind I'm not talking about shorting. Only buy low, sell high
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:38:09
Quite often you will go nowhere as with the example and lose money due to inflation and loss of opportunity cost as I have stated.
The central banks make it very difficult to sit on a loss or no gains for a long period of time. That is a loss too since they are inflating the price of everything when they dilute the currency

Yes, I didn't factor in fees but with the range that BTC is going through you should be able to make trades that more than compensate you for those fees
My current position is to hold some BTC and trade an amount as well. This helps me to add to my position while still having confidence that it will go up. And yes, I do believe it will go up. I'm targeting 50K but as we have seen it won't be  a straight path and could take many years
With the way the price moves I'd suggest everyone have a permanent stake but the volatility can also make trading very profitable with which you can add to that stake.

If you think it is the bottom you should buy in order to lower your breakeven and gain if it returns to your original breakeven
the benefits(or chance of not losing) are 2:1 if you buy. If it goes flat, you lose nothing. If it goes up, you gain. Only if it goes down and does not recover would you lose but if you really believed that you would sell

yes, the law of big numbers kicks in at some point. Hopefully not before 1 or 2 T$ (for the whole lot)

If blocks get orphaned does that mean the BTC float shrinks? IOW does that make the remaining blocks even more scarce and thus leveraged

At this point the banker issues a 'bail-'in' taking all the players money except for 200 dollars and issue stock certificates in the bank.
Then the game continues and the banker gets a raise

You mean the same CFTC that allows traders to drop $2b worth of notional contracts on the gold market when the price starts to run away?
No, it is probably not good news. Now they can short to infinity and will

Semantics. The process of lending money on deposits you do not have is money printing. You deposit $100 into an account, the bank can loan out 90% (or whatever the fractional ratio is nowadays). The $90 is deposited into a bank after having purchased something and $81 can now be loaned out. This is called the money multiplier effect. at a 10% fractional reserve ratio, this multiplies the money by 9 times. So on $100 you now have $900 in deposits circulating in the economy. So what happens if everyone decides they want their money. The Treasury is legally obligated to print it
So technically you are right in saying not all banks print, practically the Treasury still needs to satisfy those demands if called upon. So loaning money out of nothing is the same from an economic perspective as printing it

Not exactly true. The bank also creates money out of nothing. It is not just lending money, it is also printing it, which is diluting the money the rest of us have, for their own purposes and gains. They literally have a license to print money and we are paying for it. This is why people want to flock to BTC. They want to preserve the purchasing power that they earned with their labor

You can transfer funds from Payza to BTC and you can hook up a bank account and credit card to payza. The transfer fees will probably kill you but it might be a rough hack for now
