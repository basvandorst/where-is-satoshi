I'm sorry for the people who lose bitcoin, but (1) we can't help them, and (2) apparently, people like OP *don't know* we can't help them.
This is preventable by education.

Regarding Kant and universal law, here's how I would put it:
1. Assume it is ethical to use other people's computers, without their knowledge, to mine Bitcoin.
2. Why would you want to do such a thing? *Because you are hoping to increase the ratio (mining-rate/mining-cost).* Running on your own computers would decrease the rate, and renting computers would increase the cost. The botnet offers high rate at low cost.
3. If botnet mining is ethical, then it must be a universal law: i.e., it must be ethical for everyone.
4. If botnet mining is ethical for everyone, then it is possible to conceive of a universe where everyone mines via botnet.
5. In such a universe, there are as many botnets as there are people.
6. In such a universe, the average computing power of each botnet is very small: total-available-computing-power/world-population.
7. In such a universe, the rate/cost ratio of botnet mining is unfavorable, due to a low mining rate. On average, (mining rate of a botnet) is going to be the same as (mining rate for all the computers that are legally yours).
8. In such a universe, botnet mining makes no sense, because it does not provide the advantage listed in (2).
9. Thus, such a universe is illogical.
10. Thus, by (3), botnet mining cannot be ethical.
Personally, I'm surprised that there's even a *question* as to whether botnet mining is ethical. The Internet never ceases to amaze me.

To me, the word "fork" suggests more than just a change; it implies a difference of opinion or intent between the old and the new. From [Wikipedia](


When I said "precautionary upgrade", I was thinking about a non-controversial change by the Bitcoin developers themselves. If the upgrade is non-controversial (e.g., suppose in a couple of decades that SHA-2-256 is obviously broken and SHA-3-256 is not), then everyone adopts the upgrade, no schism results, and "fork" would not be the right word for it, IMHO.
As for adding artificial demurrage to Bitcoin, I bet that the majority of the Bitcoin community would object to it. If the Bitcoin developers want to stay in charge (I presume they do), they're going to steer clear of anything controversial.
Besides, why artificially limit the lifetime of the crypto? If the current Bitcoin cryptography won't be broken for another 376 years, why put an artificial "time's up" at 50 years?

It sounds to me like you don't share Kant's moral philosophy. You're essentially admitting that you *don't* have enough gum for the entire class.
If you allow an unlimited number of people to choose botnet mining, then people will buy botnets until they have driven the benefit/cost ratio down to that of legal mining. The result is a tragedy-of-the-commons scenario: illegal mining no longer has an advantage over legal mining, and so (8) still holds. Thus, from Kant's perspective, botnet mining is unethical.
If you allow only a limited number of botnets, then illegal mining may still have an advantage over legal mining. But now you have conceived of a universe where some people are **not allowed** to choose botnet mining. At this point, your scenario cannot be universal law (Adam's choice prevents Bob from making a choice), and so (3) is not satisfied. Thus, from Kant's perspective, botnet mining is unethical.
@_date: 2012-09-09 05:03:58
I am trying to provide counterexamples to erroneous patterns of reasoning. I am using obviously unethical acts in order to make the errors clear.
Kant is not assuming that everyone in the real world is equally capable. I already explained this, or at least I tried to:


It's a thought experiment. Imagine a world where everyone *is* capable. Does botnet mining make sense there? No, because if everyone is capable of getting a botnet, then the returns from botnet mining will become the same as those from legal mining. In this imaginary world, it is illogical to run a botnet for mining, as it brings no advantage to the person running the operation.
Now, back to the real world. There are barriers to entry in setting up botnet mining. These barriers mean that botnet mining has an advantage over legal mining; thus, there will be botnet miners, and there will be people whose computers are used for mining, without their prior permission. Kant would not deny any of this; he realizes that the imaginary world is different from our own.
So why bring up this imaginary world? Because Kant's idea is that a logical flaw in the imaginary world implies an ethical flaw in the real world.
In the real world, it makes financial sense to be a botnet operator. Comparatively few people will run mine bitcoin via botnets, and so the operators are able to profit. But by Kant's categorical imperative, botnet mining in the real world is still unethical, because it would be illogical in the imaginary world.

Er, it looks like they *are* done, at least with the initial send of the message.
These are the actual bitcoin transfers, interpreted as 8-bit sequences:


If you interpret each octet as an ASCII character, the resulting text is:




This is a link to a QR code. Decoded, the QR code contains the text:


Dividing into octets and converting to ASCII, you get:


So unless the rest of the URL is encoded somewhere (e.g., the QR code has an artificially short length), it looks like we're at a dead end.

Cryptography is messy, and so is the world that makes it necessary. My hope is that the developers will be prudent in all changes they make, and that when necessity forces them to upgrade the crypto, that they will do their job well.




*That's the point I was trying to make in my last post!* Why put in *artificial demurrage* (such as your 50-year proposal), which involves controversy and extra complexity, when there are *already* demurrage effects that stem from the inherent nature of the cryptography involved?
At any rate, I believe I have made the point that got me into this discussion: being able to generate keypairs to lost coins is not mutually exclusive with Bitcoin being broken.

Robbing banks also takes skill, wherewithal, and passion. Cracking safes is hard, and planning a getaway takes work. Some people are good at this, but a significant fraction of the population will never become successful bank robbers. Some people will just plain suck at bank robbery.
That does not make bank robbery ethical.
Kant's idea is this: an act is unethical if everyone doing it would cause a contradiction. Out in the world, not everyone is able to act in the same way, and this means that these actions will still have incentives. *Kant does not deny that such acts have incentives* -- he is merely defining ethics in terms of a thought experiment: what if everyone *did* have equal ability to act?
"Imma stab this dude in the face, because it gives me fun. If everyone stabbed dudes in the face, I would lose fun. But because *I'm really good at stabbing*, and some dudes *aren't*, that makes it ethical."
@_date: 2012-09-08 19:52:09
Yes. And that is why, according to Kant, the system is not ethical. Kant's moral philosophy is very much **not** "the early bird gets the worm".
"Imma stab this dude in the face. But if I stab him in the face, before *he* stabs me in the face, then it's ethical."

It's possible to both salvage lost coins *and* have an unbroken protocol.
Cryptography can only get weaker over time. And it's not just ECDSA at stake -- Bitcoin uses other crypto primitives, such as SHA-256. I don't expect to ever see Bitcoin broken, but I would not be surprised if I live to see a precautionary upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol.
Such an upgrade might not apply to lost coins, because nobody has the key pair for including those coins in an upgrade transaction. Only active coins get the upgrade.
The result: a world where lost coins have weak crypto (and can be brute-forced), yet the current protocol is strong.
@_date: 2012-11-11 15:31:01
At that strength, you may be better off attacking the crypto in Bitcoin itself, instead of the password.

[Some people don't think passwords should be memorized](
Granted, the security needs of an encryption passphrase are much different from those of a login password. For starters, authorities can send reddit a subpoena whether or not you write down your reddit password.
But think about it. $4000 is at stake. You probably won't want to put that in your actual wallet, but you might secure the passphrase (or a paper wallet backup) as you would any other valuable worth $4000: in a safe, or in a well-hidden location in your home (depends on home), or in a safety deposit box.
There is a slight reduction in theoretical security, and maybe that's important enough to you to justify not writing it down. But a physical backup optimizes the situation for the more probable risk: forgetting your passphrase. It's less likely the authorities will confiscate your Bitcoin.

For merchants, implementing Bitcoin support does have cost: you have to write at least a little new code. For customers, switching from Paypal (or a similar service) to Bitcoin brings the cost of downloading and learning to use new software. These may be small costs, but they are costs nonetheless.

The problem is that it's not easy to tell the difference between the lost and the unused. If I see an old address with lots of money behind it, I don't know if the corresponding wallet is in a landfill or in a safe. It may not even be possible to track down the owner.

Yes. Everyone needs to adapt. Every technology has some adoption cost. This is all true.

For 256-bit elliptic curve keys, [keylength.com]( predicts that they'll be safe for at least a decade or two, maybe until near the end of the century. Granted, these are conservative predictions, but if Bitcoin survives into the next century, treasure hunting is a very real possibility. Especially if there is a significant amount of money involved.

Might just be me, but the article seemed to meander a bit.


This was a good point. Bitcoin can't just be a substitute for an existing currency; it has to fill a niche that hasn't been filled yet. It has to transform the public's expectations of money.


Buying drugs online is a sensational story. Unfortunately, that means most people will only hear about that one use case for Bitcoin.


This was an odd conclusion, given the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. Unlike the other examples of online currency, Bitcoin isn't dependent on an organization that can go bankrupt. It can survive without being mainstream successful, and it can go a long time without posing a serious challenge to other currencies: there are no impatient venture capitalists to pull the plug.
@_date: 2011-06-15 16:01:19
The *current crypto* could be broken, but that doesn't mean that *Bitcoin* will be broken. The network can transition to stronger crypto when the current crypto starts to become weak. For example, before you can spend an old coin, you might have to do a special old-coin-to-new-coin transaction first. Over time, all the coins in circulation are upgraded to use new crypto.
However, lost coins cannot be upgraded, because nobody has the private key needed to convert those coins. This means that lost coins will, over time, become weaker than coins that are actively traded. Thus, the Bitcoin network remains strong, yet treasure hunting may still be possible.
@_date: 2011-06-14 22:58:10
Right. You can't tell if an *individual* bitcoin is lost or not, but you *can* estimate the *proportion* of bitcoins in circulation (e.g., by watching what coins appear in transactions on Mt. Gox).

I wouldn't mind typing a password before sending a transaction. Of course, it doesn't help much if the user chooses a weak password.
A better way: if you ever have a substantial number of bitcoins (say, more than 10 if their value stays high), the client should warn the user to secure them. Throw them in a TrueCrypt volume with a good password, write that password down in a secure place, and *never* mount that volume unless you're going to immediately spend/transfer those coins.

I agree that EFF's actions seem reasonable. I bet they were expecting only a little money to trickle in via Bitcoin, and when they got $35,000, this went from being a neat side project/PR trick to a serious source of revenue. The lawyers probably reviewed it before, and now that it's beyond what they had originally considered, they're reviewing it again.
My trust in EFF hasn't dropped because of this.
@_date: 2011-06-29 17:17:47

Those coins are lost with no easy way to recover them. The remaining coins become rarer, and thus more valuable. So if you lose a coin, it's like you gave a little bit of it to everyone else.
Depending on future circumstances, there may be a sort of gray-area mining: brute-forcing forgotten accounts. Imagine I had mined a bunch of bitcoins really early on, when it was easy to mine and wasn't worth much. I then consolidated all my bitcoins under a single address. Finally, I lost interest in Bitcoin and deleted my wallet. If attacks on the current crypto become easier, and bitcoins become extremely valuable, then it might be lucrative for others to brute-force the private key for my old bitcoin address. It might still take years and lots of computing power, but if the payout was worth billions of dollars, I could imagine organized crime making the investment.
I say this is gray-area because there is no way to determine if the original owners have lost their wallet or not. If I see a lot of coins at a given address, it could be (a) someone's life savings, or (b) a forgotten fling with Bitcoin.
Just speculating about the future.

I'm guessing that the EFF *does* have the guts to accept bitcoins -- it's just that $35,000 is more useful if they know who donated it. For example, what the EFF is legally allowed to do with the money (like fund someone's campaign) might be different if it was one person donating $35,000 vs. 3,500 people donating $10.

It might not explain the whole situation, but this sounds awfully similar to a [perpetuity]( and the theories about them.
Suppose I own an apartment building. I rent out rooms to people, and I collect rent on a monthly basis (let's say $1,000/month, after subtracting expenses). I never stop collecting money; if someone moves out, another person moves in (let's say this is in a crowded city). If the building houses 10 people, that's $10,000 a month, every month. It's a perpetual money machine.
Now, suppose someone wants to buy the building from me. How much money do I charge them?
This can make your brain hurt. The building is worth infinity dollars. No matter what I charge, it's going to be less than infinity. I'd be crazy to sell at any price, because no price is fair to me. But if buildings can be worth infinity dollars, how is it possible that people buy and sell property all the time? Somehow these people have figured out prices that are less than infinity, yet still fair.
The solution to the paradox is that *money now is much more valuable than money later.* If I sell the apartment building for 10 million, I could invest that money in another business, or perhaps build a new apartment complex somewhere else. I could have done those things before, but it would have taken me much longer. These opportunities make up for me losing my perpetual money machine. Worst case scenario, I could put my money in the bank at 0.1% interest, and I'd have a perpetual money machine again.

I had a slightly different experience. I have had a credit card for less than a year, but Coinbase thought I was associated with my current address for more than a year. So it's not just credit card statements: maybe Coinbase was going off of my checking account as well?
At any rate, I also had difficulty on that question, because Coinbase's records were incomplete. But I did eventually get verified.
