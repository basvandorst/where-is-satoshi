as opposed to m-pesa &lt; -&gt; btc? I would agree for sure that this would be very useful.
I suppose that I would be a bit worried about security in many countries in Africa; of course I recognize this as a bias learned from my own culture, but maybe I should look into doing something like this. Thanks.

Thanks for the explanation. Would the use of sidechains obviate the need for an increased block size?

I can see how the darknet thing could ~~land me in prison for life~~ make me millions, but I fail to see how I could make a living by submitting found bugs.

I'm an electrical engineer; fairly proficient in programming (but no rockstar). If I only had a brain, I would add something of worth to the bitcoin network/ecosystem like lighting networking has the potential to do.
About a year ago, I considered doing something with hardware wallets (and wrote some preliminary libraries), but mothballed it to find a job to feed my family; now I'm not sure if there's as much of a need for yet another hardware wallet implementation.

thanks for the links, and wow that was a lot of money. I guess if you're the amoral type who considers that to be "contract" work that's cool. 
re-reading your first comment, I now kind of see your point in "weeding out bad actors", which breaks the strength of the network effect. I suppose in a sense that bitstamp was a bad actor, not in the evil sense, but their paradigm was bad; and relieving them of their ill-held funds burns down the old forest to create room for the new.
Considering that, could the bitstamp heist be considered a ~~grayhat enterprise?~~ No, stealing is still far from preferable behavior.

Well, I guess you have a point there. Where do I sign up for hacking school?
Also, context?

ipv4 vs ipv6. ipv6 is clearly better, but the world continues to run on ipv4

Physical *currency* could soon be a thing of the past. Money was never a physical thing to disappear. Money exists as a philosophical construct of how we value labor and resources. Its mode of representation has been different through ages and across cultures. Currency is just a way of representing money.
Fiat never was money, just as paper gold isn't real gold. They are ways of representing money, but money is just what people value, and you can't touch that.

I wouldn't go so far as to say that the averige user needs to run a miner, but I take exception to pushing a node out of their reach.
I have been asking myself for a long time what the consequences of not increasing the limit are, and have concluded that although it will reduce the ability to do high frequency micro transactions, it likely wouldn't bar the economic activity of average users who don't make payments multiple times per day, or even every day. It would mean that the blockchain would become more like the banking backbone, leaving to other technologies to enable high frequency transactions.


That's a good point. Will you get censored for mentioning a different place for discussion?

Perhaps I misunderstand, but doesn't that contradict? You can't not make the block size bigger and also increase its size. I wrote a whole post on this an hour ago, and it got auto-deleted even though I was disagreeing with bip101.
I'll get downvoted with you to oblivion, but I don't think bitcoin should be a large (and centralized) payment processing network. It really isn't very efficient. LN and the like offer ways to keep the block size where it is and simultaneously increase the speed and amount of transactions possible.
I believe that bitcoin transfers should fulfill the role that banks do now - moving money to and from payment processing networks (like LN), not for high-volume, highly-concurrent transactions.

The promise of bitcoin as an economic tool are alive as ever. 
It doesn't need to be the internet's paypal. Its first class function is as a token or currency.

Imagine that. Bitcoin time capsule.

What's it missing? What does it have to offer? I was on the hype train for a long while until I started asking what their plans were with it. I found out there's nothing decentralized or distributed about it, and that a store has to provide and maintain its own hosting just the same as any other e-commerce platform. 
They claim that it is censorship resistant, but that can hardly be the case when an IP address is publicly posted and must remain up for the store to be open.
It seems to me now that the only things that openbazaar does past any other platform is to provide a platform for arbitration, and provides a central place for aggregated store listings like ebay or amazon. While true that no member of the network can remove another store's listings on openbazaar, the claim of "no fees" is absurd. Store owners have to pay a continual fee to whatever web hosting service (be that their internet provider) to keep their store running.
What features are missing? Well, a main feature missing is what I've already mentioned - distribution. They use a DHT to locate stores, if I understand correctly, but that's just a location of the store's server. Decentralized, yes, but if a store goes down, it goes down - so what new demographic will openbazaar serve?
The other big elephant in the room which openbazaar devs are avoiding is TOR. They want to rebrand openbazaar as a "safe, free marketplace". It's neither free as in beer or libre.
Then again, maybe I misunderstood what they were telling me over at the openbazaar slack room.

I was unable to find anything about block size in the white paper, but I'll take your word for it. Either way, no one is holding back the block size - but there is a consensus set by satoshi (after he hard forked it, of course) to a max of 1MB. Not increasing the blocksize where it is at now doesn't necessarily mean that bitcoin can only scale up to some limit (1MB) - but that the way we use it will eventually have to become more sophisticated. Of course, that also has a limit, but it will extend the abilities of the network far beyond the current limitations put it.
@_date: 2015-11-13 19:01:10
I'd appreciate to know where I'm wrong.
@_date: 2015-10-31 14:38:34
Except it's exactly as centralized as current e-commerce platforms are. Sure, maybe it is an agglomeration of stores that each run their own server, but it's still fundamentally the same as any self-hosted e-commerce platform. Until they implement some kind of distributed hash table, or use the blockchain for stateful storage, it's nothing worth writing home about.
Lots of hype, but they don't seem to plan on meaningful delivery.
To be clear, I really wished that they would have become what the hype said, but they didn't. Long story short - if you want something, sometimes you have to be the guy to build it.

Is it too late to get 1000 bits? Because I totally think bitcoin is worth something.

As much as I like to go look at my videos, you should fix that link.
@_date: 2015-11-13 19:00:42
Sorry for the late reply. Neither of those are physical laws, as accurate as they have been historically. What's more, nielsen's law is a rule of thumb for high-end users, and if BIP101 follows that, it will move bitcoin further away from average users. It is foolish to assume a future ability to support a protocol feature, but that didn't stop windows vista.
