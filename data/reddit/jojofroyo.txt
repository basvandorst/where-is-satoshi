I'm guessing with the pending split of pay pal and eBay you'll soon be ebaying again. I think eBay will be integrating credit card support.

To have instant buy you have to put a cc on your account. But it won't charge your cc unless there isn't enough in your bank account. 
But it is 30 days after your first purchase.

Thanks again! I've been reading up on Bitcoin for a while and even bought some a while back with some spare money. 
It's fun using magic internet money

Thank you! It's been interesting reading up on information about bitcoin, it's exciting to be getting involved.

Hahah that's what I do!

From what I understand Apple hasn't allowed the purchase or selling from Idevices yet, so the app is basically just Iwallet right now. If they're going to release their own app it probably won't be until Apple allows the same functionality as the website. Plus high function apps do not just pop up over night. 
I've downloaded the app, I think it's pretty cool but have no need to have access to Bitcoin on my phone so have not sent anything to it.

I think it staying around this price is a good thing. And I'm not just saying that cause I want to buy some more next payday. It's remained relatively stable since it's huge jump. So people aren't dumping it to make profits. It will just take time for it to build up to another big jump.

People write down safe combinations all the time. I think writing down your Bitcoin safe's combinations would be no different. 
Next you just have to hide you off-line Linux machine behind a painting in the wall.

Things really holding Bitcoin back:
* widespread acceptance. 
* 1 confirmation reliability
* the ability to pay for most porn with it

Ahead of the time. Wonder how long it will take for the brothels in Nevada to do the same...

Very generous of you! 
@_date: 2014-06-04 04:25:26
Welcome to all the fun! What do you plan on doing with it? Hold on to it for a while or buy things? 
I've just got bought my first as well and it's been cool watching it be worth more

It was $100 a week for a month for me. They just kicked me up to a $1000 a week.

Easier yes. As funny, no. 
It's own power cord is very nice to have. Or even a few if you move it around a lot. I had never though of using it for both. Have to give it a try. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 23:30:37
Good on you! You're awesome!

Well is your goal to spend money or make money? You can't spend really spend investments.

I say make a fake email and a new wallet somewhere and try it out.

I agree! I got into because of my favorite bars started accepting Bitcoin, but once I bought I just decided to hold on to it right now.

Yep! It was just about what was left from my tax refund.

My credit union has a fee on their checking. Unless I use my debt card x times and get a direct deposit I have to pay it. But if I also hit those requirements they give me interest on my checking account. But since I'm poor that ~$0.00 doesn't earn much interest. 
@_date: 2014-05-30 03:44:12
Thank you and Welcome to you as well! 
@_date: 2014-05-22 00:16:19
True. But when I meant investment I meant more in a traditional sense. Like do you buy them and put them in a wallet and plan not touch them for years. 
I guess with the ease of creating new wallets, it wouldn't be that hard to do both.   
@_date: 2014-07-09 00:54:46
Wow! Thank you! 
@_date: 2014-05-30 04:31:37
Ya that didn't work out. Turns out I'm not quite so savy at social media.

I will for speak for Satoshi. I'm like a psychic. 
Hard Forks are a fundamental change from the direction the 'Bitcoin bullet' was shot. Whenever people speak of making such a change to Bitcoin where there could be potentially 2 different block chains isn't improving Bitcoin, it is trying to create a new crypto without the years of slow build up Bitcoin has endured since its introduction. The "I-wanna-make-my-mark-by-'improving'(destroying)-someone-else's-work" mentality has been around forever though and things do change. Bitcoin is a prototype so...

Coinbase has a feature to create a paper wallet. So just search for it on there. Putting it into a paper wallet keeps it safe as long as you have the paper and it's just a good long term storage solution. 
Some people think it's a bad idea because coinbase technically in control of your coins, not you. I've never had any problems with them, but you never know what can happen when it comes to weird Internet money. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:49:56
Well at least you got into this knowing it was an investment and a roller coaster one at that. 
Hold on, keep the faith. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:14:48
No problem! I'm no expert by any means. Your own research would be best. 
Have fun and enjoy the ride. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:25:12
That is the hardest thing to do. When I bought some Bitcoin, I got bored and played in crypto exchanges. I invested in a crypto and when I transferred to my computer the wallet corrupted and won't unlock anymore. So be careful. 
I suggest you put it into a paper wallet and just lock it away for 6 months.

The spirit plane is pretty well encrypted but I've learned to navigate it. I shouldn't take all the credit the amulet has made it all possible.

Here's the problem with that. 
1. Who knows how long ago they made the trademark? More than a year or two, pretty realistic he hadn't heard of it, since most lawyers don't deal with it. 
2. All he has to say is "I didn't know, that's what my client told me" easy out for him. 
3. That's pretty much his job.

free bitcoin you say? it's almost like free internet porn but better!
