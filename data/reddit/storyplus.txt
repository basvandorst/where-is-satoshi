can they generate addresses and forward bitcoin?

that means people couldn't create wallets via API for a couple of weeks?
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:21:46
today API is slow again
WTF, can't do such a simple thing.... can't believe i will have to run my client

hi mcaizgk2, thanks for your time again ;)
how to get a balance of an arbitrary address? watch-only wallet? I am still kinda wary to create all users' wallets on my server, was thinking to use blockchain or may be another server with cold wallets

i am in the same situation and looking for alternatives
you can call a blockr.io API yourself
I am also looking for a local block explorer/browser, but can't find. Bitcoin core doesn't allow you to browse arbitrary address
edit: current delay is 30 min. still too much, looks like they are waiting for 3 confirmations due to TM

I want a forwarding service, I don't want to run my own client, I want to sleep well
@_date: 2014-03-22 04:08:54
thanks, it works but still quite slow

just had a quick look - still not clear can it monitor addresses? If i have thousand clients, i need to monitor every address and call the url with unique key. Who's gonna do it?
@_date: 2014-03-21 15:03:54
damn i don't want to run a bitcoin client myself, this ends bad for fat people
@_date: 2014-03-24 05:02:47
can i use coinbase without a company? i want some anonimity
@_date: 2014-03-25 02:48:34
hi, thanks for you work!
I am looking at a blockchain.info API alternative currently. But running my own client sort of scary, so many people get hacked. 
Anyway how do I monitor addresses? Do I have to do a perpetual loop querying all existing addresses?

charging 15% eh?
