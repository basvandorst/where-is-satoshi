Sorry, bad choice of words. It is not pegged to oil officially, but that is basically what is keeping this system going. The USD is due for hyperinflation. now banks are going to extremes in terms of interest rates. So much is going on. even politicians are admitting that the system may not last. people have done the research that it is mathematically impossible for USD to keep going forever or even a very long time.

BTC is limited and is backed by those who believe in it. Also the USD is pegged by something. It is pegged by oil. research the petro dollar. If the petrodollar collapes, then USD collapses most probably. Please do more research on these subjects.

No. the more people that buy bitcoin, the more the price rises. It is called supply and demand.
