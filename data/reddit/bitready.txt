That's a good way to summarize it.  The idea is that you never own Bitcoin while still saving money.  Also, there are many times where you go buy coins on Coinbase and it turns out that the price you bought at is higher than the price used at checkout, costing you more.  
We are ultimately targeting people who aren't familiar with Bitcoin, but are still interested in taking advantage of the discounts that come with it.  They never have to experience what may be the "scary" part of Bitcoin (owning and managing it).

We are planning on a $5 subscription.

Hi Logical, thanks for reading through our site. One of the most important aspects of our service is the fact that we don't charge fees on any transactions - a feature we're proud to offer.
In reference to your comment about us holding your bitcoins, you maintain ownership of your funds in dollars until the point of transaction. We believe that our low yearly subscription fee is a reasonable cost for our service and discounts we provide.

BitReady is free for at least the next few months.  If we ever move to a paid model, we will choose a monthly/yearly subscription plan over per transaction fees.

This is actually what we are trying to accomplish at [BitReady.io](  We are compatible with any merchant using BitPay, Coinbase, or GoCoin and allow the customer to pay in Bitcoin without actually buying Bitcoin beforehand or even having to understand the technology (removing many barrier to Bitcoin use).   Keep an eye out for our public launch in about a week.
