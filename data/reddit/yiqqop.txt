It really depends on what Bitcoin friendly things he would do. If he simply like Bitcoin but will do nothing else there is no point in voting for him such as to ease regulation or build up a country reserve of Bitcoin.

Centralized is always centralized, no need to blame Localbitcoins but instead implement a unstoppable solution.
@_date: 2019-03-29 16:40:14
I hope they use some proof of reserve that cannot be manipulated

Those problems are easy to solve: Move all fiat money, loans/mortgage, insurance and whatever other services to a competing bank that do accept transfers to/from bank related to Bitcoin. Be sure to tell the bank why you transferred everything to one of their competitors. That is what I did when something similar happened to me. They offered to lift the restrictions when I started moving my $500k mortgage but I told them I refuse to be treated like a criminal and will move mine and my family bank services to a competitor which I did.

10 years and people still think Bitcoin is a company that can be shut down.
@_date: 2019-02-22 17:13:03
How about you transact 100+ times on the Lightning Network by paying 18 cent and then practically free transactions on LN.
@_date: 2019-04-05 09:03:03
People trade more fiat for Bitcoin now compared to before when prices were lower... impossible to point to a specific event and people that do that are just guessing.
@_date: 2019-01-31 05:50:44
Thanks! I will check them out.
@_date: 2019-01-06 16:07:17
The other way? Doesn't that mean the other side (not your node) owns the Bitcoin? (you gave them Bitcoin?)
@_date: 2019-01-25 05:55:23
Yes I already know about that solution but to me it feels not 100% since the attacker may have information that making him sure I have more. That is why I want something like time lock where I would like to be able to prove the Bitcoin is locked but at the same time key validation should not be possible until the time lock is open but I don't know if that will be possible even when Mast and Taproot is released (as key validation is possible today before time lock is open)
@_date: 2019-01-25 05:41:12
How would they know the keys I give them work? All keys will be rejected until unlock block has passed?
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:00:04
I was referring to you tipping yourself 15k sat being a tipping thing and not LN
@_date: 2019-01-25 06:15:58
Time lock may be too inflexible for you but I see it as a benefit in this situation and the only method I know of where the Bitcoin is locked without no one being able to use them until time X.
@_date: 2019-01-31 05:49:04
Thank you, I was afraid I would have to generate new invoices for each payment. I wanted to save time and not set up my own custom destination node but I can do that if I cannot find a custodial solution where I can generate the invoices using a web API call from the client Android app.
@_date: 2019-01-31 06:04:00
This is most likely a more long term solution but it requires a lot more time I think. I am only making a small demo/prototype and I want to avoid hosting my own node because I think it will take too much time since I have never set up a LN-node and only read about it.
I don't want to use custodial solution because I think it is better or safer but in my case I think it is faster to setup. Prototype 2 if there ever is one may have way more time and I can make a more decent implementation.
@_date: 2019-01-11 16:52:38
Amazon is evil though, I would not shop there even if they accepted Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-01-11 17:24:49
Haha, that is nothing to celebrate, they do almost no transactions on BCash. Since I started using LN I have done 99% of all my Bitcoin transactions on LN. Clearly LN does way more transactions than most other currencies 
@_date: 2019-01-25 06:09:59
I need a solution where it is not possible to verify keys until time has unlocked the lock, maybe once Mast and Taproot are released?
@_date: 2019-01-27 15:15:19
That is the most stupid thing I heard all week. Giving Monero that in 18 years is most likely worth 0 just because the number 10 sounds more than 0.12 when the amounts are not of the same thing.
@_date: 2019-01-04 17:01:15
Open a channel with as little Bitcoin as you are able to, send your 0.1 Bitcoin to your channel and settle the channel. Now you have let's say 0.2 Bitcoin. Send the 0.2 Bitcoin to an exchange and sell it. You might have trouble finding some node to open a channel with unless you fund your side of the channel but whatever you fund your channel with you will get all back +0.1 when you settle.
Edit: There might be exchanges that accept LN already but I don't know their names. If that is the case you can send the 0.1 Bitcoin to them without settling.
@_date: 2019-01-02 17:35:47
Coins you are actively trading with you should of course keep on an exchange but you could transfer the coins to another exchange at least.
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:02:17
Bitcoin is for everyone, cannot take sides.
@_date: 2019-01-11 17:08:06
Well, if they try to use something other than Bitcoin they will eventually fail and switch to Bitcoin, I think that is why people like to talk about it here.
@_date: 2019-01-24 20:50:58
The only thing protecting me in that situation is that you can never verify I give you the correct key and if you wait and keep me alive to unlock the first 5% there is another key for the next 5% forcing you to keep me alive otherwise risking all Bitcoin are burned as you get the wrong keys.
@_date: 2019-01-06 15:54:30
Obviously not stability towards fiat currencies because that would mean Bitcoin failed or that fiat currencies have suddenly become hard money. Stability in feature set, that people can trust in the current and future capabilities of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-01-24 21:10:43
No one else would have access to the keys in this situation and the money would be gone forever :(
Edit: I guess I can have a special rule in the contract making the coins spendable by a charity organisation, my kids or someone else after 30 years or something like that.
@_date: 2019-01-25 06:23:42
Haha, I want a solution for a more prepared attacker. Your thug would probably go away if he got $300 and not put my family in captivity for 10+ years 
@_date: 2019-01-31 05:51:17
@_date: 2019-01-24 20:47:04
For me at least I think it would be impossible to go all my life without leaking some evidence of having Bitcoin such as a registered account on Coinbase (personal info hacked/stolen), never pay publicly with Bitcoin as that would show I have some. Always be using VPN/TOR and other services to hide my node and never have any references to Bitcoin or transactions on any internet connected device. I think such a thing is impossible for 99.999% of people. Of course we can do our best to hide the fact that we own Bitcoin but it is not 100% safe without something like TIME\_LOCK unless people suggest something else but what I find weird is that I never hear people talk about TIME\_LOCK like that and that must mean there are better ways or that people don't feel they have to be totally safe?
@_date: 2019-01-24 21:07:08
What if the amount of money is nothing spectacular where 5% is just enough for a family to live a middle-class life for about 1 year. That would probably not make it worth it for attackers to keep me or my family captive for 20 years.
@_date: 2019-01-24 20:54:42
What is not 100% safe with TIME\_LOCK then (I can only loose 5%) or are you talking about a scenario where the network hard-fork to steal my money haha or that miners censor my TIME\_LOCK'ed funds forever? I exclude scenarios that I find too crazy like the above examples because if they are true then Bitcoin as a currency has failed anyway.
@_date: 2019-01-04 18:03:14
I'm sorry but I don't know anything about the restrictions and rules of Tippin but in regards to Lightning Network channels the other side of the channel you want to settle needs to have at least 0.1 Bitcoin before you send your 0.1 Bitcoin to it because you cannot settle more than the total balance of the channel.
@_date: 2019-01-24 20:32:22
No, I would only be able to access 5% and I am ok with whatever consequences that might have economically as it is more important for me to have 100% safety. Also I might have things to sell in a situation like you describe and family that would help.
@_date: 2019-01-31 05:56:37
I can limit the demo to use a direct route between the source and destination to control both ends and can choose freely the versions of software but since time is limited I want to take as many shortcuts I can. Since Sphinx is not yet supported my best bet seems to be what some others suggested that the source keeps generating invoices on the request of the client(s) and the client-app hides all this and pays the invoices one by one when the button is pressed.
@_date: 2019-01-31 09:56:00
Thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2019-01-31 05:45:48
Thanks, I will check it out.
@_date: 2019-01-27 15:53:58
The reason stores can do that is because they use only 1 currency most of the time. If the store said you can pay 0.99 Euro or 1 USD people would not simply take the 0.99 Euro but instead they would look up the exchange rate.
@_date: 2019-01-27 15:44:38
"Unless you believe way more Bitcoin, which is fine."
My comment is true whatever thing you try to compare. People that believe 100 000 Joe-coins are better than 0.12 Bitcoin simply because 100 000 is a bigger number than 0.12 have truly misunderstood cryptocurrency and scarcity.
@_date: 2019-01-11 17:01:50
I hope it will be multiple small countries first in Africa, they need the economic boost and stability a mature Bitcoin would give.
@_date: 2019-01-31 05:49:40
Thanks! I will check them out.
@_date: 2019-01-24 20:56:05
True, seems like a win-win :)
@_date: 2019-01-24 21:08:59
Yes that is a win-win for you but only if you have plenty of Bitcoin which I think most attackers won't have but I might be wrong :) And I cannot think of a more secure solution anyway forcing me to accept this drawback you describe.
@_date: 2019-01-24 20:26:03
That is unlikely I think, quite a lot of maintenance to keep someone alive for 20 years. It also increases the risk of getting caught quite a lot to keep someone captive for 20 years.
@_date: 2019-01-25 06:08:14
My traditional finances are not safe because that is not possible. I am interested to see if It is possible to fully secure your Bitcoin removing most of the human elements.
@_date: 2019-01-06 16:26:22
I agree, there will be one and only one hard money in the end. I think there will however be other currencies/tokens that may or may not use Bitcoin only for it's security but represent other value that has no connection to Bitcoin value such as game items, stocks, land ownership ...
@_date: 2019-01-05 21:18:08
and others, lol
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:46:06
You cannot equate statistics like that to real people. I know only of 6 people that own Bitcoin and they all store it on exchanges if they have not sold it. That means all of them are bunched together in the top row of your table and represent only 1 Address even though they are 6 people with a total investment together of maybe $20k.
@_date: 2019-01-25 06:12:25
That is a terrible solution just as insecure as having fiat in the bank. I want real security not security by placing lots of people in the way.
@_date: 2019-01-31 05:51:57
Why temporarily? Will they be shutting down their service?
@_date: 2019-01-31 07:21:05
Ok thanks, I will setup my own node if there will be a prototype/demo v2.
@_date: 2019-01-25 05:46:45
Ok that sucks! There must be a way to reject all key validation until time criteria has passed? Is this something that will be possible with Mast/Taproot where the condition are hidden until the condition is true and is mined?
@_date: 2019-01-25 06:01:05
Thanks but this is not 100% safe. Theatre may fail or robber/kidnapper may know for sure I have more than what I show. That is why I want a method where I remove the human elements and the Bitcoin are locked until time X and key validation is not possible until time X has passed.
@_date: 2019-01-24 20:24:00
I don't want to use the N of M key solution as it is not 100% safe as you also describe. TIME\_LOCK is the only solution I can think of where it would be impossible to give the attacker money and I would also be able to prove the money is time locked.
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:49:59
They will get it eventually. I think a few countries close by have to get into some serious problem causing hyper-inflation for the average person to start realizing the value of Bitcoin. Until then it is just internet play money for them.
@_date: 2019-01-25 10:18:57
Thanks, this is a good solution but I was looking for something bulletproof where I remove the human elements as much as possible. Even if the attacker somehow know about all layers he should not be able to take the funds all at once even if I give them all keys for all layers as I would prefer it taking X years to perform this operation as the chance increases of me being able to retain some money or capturing the attacker. The reason he knows is not important because there is always a risk strictly greater than 0% that the information become available. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 06:05:16
Lol not a whale for sure, I want to learn and this is more of a solution if Bitcoin 200X or more it would be cool if there are solutions that take out most of the human elements of security.
