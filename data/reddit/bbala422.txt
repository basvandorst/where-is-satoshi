Amazon works as long as you get it from the company itself 
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:03:18
Just do it

If electrum can’t send directly to a Segwit address, you can make a legacy wallet on the Ledger, and from that, send the funds to your segwit wallet on the same Ledger by just switching blockchains in settings tab on the chrome extension

I️ think that’s because you already tried to verify your identity somehow
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:01:33
So you can’t buy or sell, but you can still send and receive. Use another email, and make a new coinbase account with that. Then, send all of your coin to that account. You should be fine, and you will be able to buy and sell again.

It’s ok, you’ll still be making money once it hits 20k :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:46:37
With 20 dollars for each buy, you’ll be paying a lot of that in fees, do it 100 or so at a time
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:26:58
Then why not just sell for USD when the price is about to drop and buy back when it’s low... it’s the same thing

Nano Ledger/Trezor. Nothing is safer than these. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:13:22
What wallet do you use?
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:08:46
Make an account on coinbase, Check the above 18 box, and just don’t do ID verification. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:17:46
Yes, the only thing you will lose is whatever you pay in transaction fees, but that’s better than losing all your BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:20:20
Don’t see why not, just remember to transfer Eth to the corresponding eth address and not to a btc address
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:15:35
Nah, if they somehow do discover that you are below 18, which they can’t unless you try an ID verification, they will restrict your account from buying/selling. You can still send/receive, so on the off chance you do get caught, just make a new coinbase account and transfer your funds to that one.

Thank you so much!

Even for a business that isn’t online? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:48:10
Coinbase has an app 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:37:07
The Ledger is 65 on Amazon
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:50:31
This happened to me, I️ just made a new account with a new email, sent my coin to the new account, and closed my old account. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:54:14
How would you claim the coins on the new chain?
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:11:13
If it relieves network congestion, why is everyone so happy about its delay?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:30:55
With that much coin, it’s wiser to purchase a hardware wallet, like Trezor or Nano Ledger

Can someone explain what the segwit2x fork is and what it means for current bitcoin investors? 
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:21:59
If this fork happens, do all bitcoin owners now own an equal amount of b2x? I’m confused 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:34:47
My Ledger is coming in today, everyone I️ have talked to has said that the device is easy to use, convenient, and secure 
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:44:39
So if I️ use coinbase, I️ won’t be able to claim them?
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:11:11
What do you mean free coins?
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:40:35
If it’s your life savings, invest $75 into a hardware wallet. If coinbase disappears, so does your life savings.
