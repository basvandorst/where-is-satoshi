Coke has a machine called "Freestyle". That's probably the touchscreen machine they're talking about. There's an admin menu that you get to by touching that particular pattern.
It's usually for maintenance to diagnose/fix issues, but a lot of store employees are shown this too in case they need to do a soft reset or check flavoring levels.
It's fun for like 2 seconds. Then you kinda just want your drink and get on with your day.

It's not about retirement savings though, its about common purchases like food etc. Besides, most people don't keep retirement funds in one asset anyway (whether its bonds, gold, or other) because its better to be diversified.
I agree bitcoin isn't the best for everything, but again, don't put all your eggs in one basket to begin with. 
The important thing here is that people are moving away from cash or credit/debit from banks. Baby steps!

"Real money"? The value we place on the greenback is as real as it gets. The inherent value of it is just cloth. In effect, toilet paper can be real money if enough people agreed it was valuable. 
As for these imaginary numbers that a computer spits out: how do you think margin works? That credit card right there in your wallet is loaded with imaginary numbers. 
Wait are you a troll? Now I feel dumb for engaging with you.

Precisely why Ethereum needs to stop being compared to Bitcoin. It's its own thing. It isn't solving or improving Bitcoin because it isn't supposed to.
Eth shortcomings are evident, for sure. But for what it is, we need to stop trying to do this "choose one or the other/better one" crap. Let it stand (or fall) on its own.
