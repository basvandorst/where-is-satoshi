Alright, apparently I'm out of the loop here. What exactly did China (or, rather, the PR of China?) do this time?

It's only a loss if you sell. Plus, $50 is nothing.

holy fuck how should we know? it could go up to &gt;$1,000 as easy as it could wind up at $1. jesus christ people, there's like 10 topics asking the exact same stupid question over and over again. 
but here's a solid advice from an internet-stranger: if you can't afford losing it, don't even think about it.

Sure. But $470 right now vs. $800 yesterday, that's quite a difference...

Haven't seen a single zombie walking around here, so I refuse to believe that. *Every* even remotely acceptable apocalyptic scenario includes zombies! We need a new theory here.

The thing is, though, that "the market" doesn't react rationally / based on facts like those presented on that website. i.e., they don't really give a flying fck about what would be *reasonable* to do if an event like Baidu's withdrawal occurs.
I really understand the concerns people have. Personally, I'm just hoping that the demand simply goes up again, for whatever reason. I should probably add that I'm relatively new to the whole BTC-business as well.

It's not just a general warning. They also currently check whether it is possible to actually *regulate* Bitcoin. This is most likely driven by fear about what virtual currencies might do to the influence of banks and hence also the influence of the EU  - just think about the EU-driven fiscal regulations which are used to maintain some sort of control of the economic situation.

Newbie here. How could that affect "our" US / EU market? The price already dropped like $300, even with the Chinese going crazy on BTCs.

Android is Open Source, Google and other OEM's implementations are definitely *not*. Google's strategy regarding restrictions is very similar to Apple's.
And as someone who wrote and released an app for Android: I wouldn't install anything from an *.apk if it isn't 100% Open Source &amp; properly audited, even though doing so and hence ignoring restrictions from Google in their Play Store could be a possibility.
