So the same the as every other currency/stock they publish then.

I don’t get it ( I have been in these buildings many times - they close to each other in Canary Wharf) this is just a picture of a bag in reception. So what if it says bitcoin are we that desperate for any bitcoin recognition we upvote even this.

You can't be serous , I grew up in apartheid South Africa and couldn't even play in a park or use a toilet that was allocated for white people so I know a thing or two about racism. Anyone who finds doge speak (which is the interpretation of how a dog speaks) racist is an idiot.

Thanks for the info, I'm South African but live in the UK. Definitely will check out your website when I'm at a pc. Until the UK removed vat from I was unable to invest into Bitcoin from my company (IT consultancy) due to the chance of paying double VAT so invested as an individual hence will have to pay capital gains for anything over 10k which is kak.
Are you not worried converting Bitcoin to fiat that the banks may flag up your account(considering they have no official stance on Bitcoin)?

I'm tired of people looking for racism in every little thing hence my "idiot" remark. The World would be a better place!

Good to hear and good luck with your venture.

Has there been any tax advice issued regarding Bitcoin in SA? Glad the UK formally issued their stance on Bitcoin taxation.

I didn't see it drop that low only been checking it last hour. Emailed my accountant just waiting for him to give  me the all clear and I'll purchase. Only real issue is £2k too little lol
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:17:38
I'm thinking the same thing, I want to spend about £2k but wondering if it will drop even more and I should hold off my purchase...

Can a person buy coins on Gox at the moment? 
@_date: 2019-03-07 12:43:30
Yes, the current system works perfectly fine - these example of why we should adopt bitcoin are ridiculous. I transfer large amounts of money every month with no issues and would not want to be doing that with bitcoin - this is coming from someone that has been involved in bitcoin since 2010.
@_date: 2019-03-04 00:01:09
Bru it goes back far further than that - 80s I can confirm but I have seen guys say the 70s in SA and 50s elsewhere.

Mobile payments  via sms (FIAT) has been around longer than bitcoin - how is this groundbreaking or news?
@_date: 2019-03-07 13:11:24
I make transfers via my bank and they are instant /free (I live in the UK) unlike having to wait ages for bitcoin confirmations  and I’m able to revert a transaction. If I sent £10k to the wrong bitcoin address I’m fucked at least with a regulated banking system I can get my money back.
@_date: 2019-03-07 13:14:38
I have been in Bitcoin since 2010 so your point makes zero sense.

You don’t pay fees when withdrawing in most European countries (probably whole EU). You only pay fees when using atms not affiliated with a bank but withdrawing from your bank or a competitors is free.

Read the sidebar it has all the info you need.

For anyone that owned a pc/modem at the time this was very clear instructions.

Yes 1 user can be creating multiple wallets a month, OPS stat is pointless. I probably have created 100+ wallets since I started using bitcoin in 2014. 
A wallet creation doesnt equal a new bitcoin user.
EDIT: And now OP has deleted his Post, this SUB is a fucking shitshow.

I just have some shitcoins now which are worth nothing.
@_date: 2019-04-01 10:27:29
I had 5 bitcoins in 2014 and I thought that was nothing back then. Only people above 20 Bitcoins I thought had a lot.

No its a real gorilla, don't let the fake drum kit fool you.

Sorry I'm on my phone or I would have made a longer reply. Do you guys pay less tax though, if you look at UK tax it's 20% up to something like $60k then 40% after that. From what I see in America you paying more than that for the majority of the workforce. Though at the end of the day, like you say when you get free health care and can see your tax money being utilised in your area then it is worth paying extra(if that is the case)
@_date: 2013-12-17 08:21:47
What I have learnt from Reddit is a lot of America is pretty much third world when compared to Europe, banking system, health care, etc etc
