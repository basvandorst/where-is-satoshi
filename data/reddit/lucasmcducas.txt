I think a crash is coming before bitcoin is ready. Will be interesting to see what happens, it might force innovation quicker in the space.

Lol my favorite post of the day

whats the rate of return?

Hidden secrets of money is fantastic :)

plus 100x leverage hahaha

I really think the community also needs to settle on names for fractions of bitcoins, at least while the dollar is still the main currency in use. Every time I tell a family member one bitcoin is worth about $400 right now they are automatically wowed because they thinking in terms of one actual coin being worth $400.

why is it taking so long to implement segwit into the core wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:55:34
I have used Bisq, can confirm it works quite well once you get used to it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:37:21
If they would just add litecoin...
@_date: 2018-09-25 18:08:27
Whew lad

lol until I can use another crypto currency to send it for much less. To many bitcoin leaders don't understand economics.

Just saw that, moon incoming.

haha I had the same experience moving all my coins from coinbase to my trezor. It's a little stressful writing down the 24 words, double checking it, hiding the 24 words and then moving your coins off of coinbase for the first time. Hugs!
@_date: 2016-06-12 00:20:27
It's halvening
@_date: 2016-06-13 03:24:46
@_date: 2017-01-24 01:38:02
You're right, I was excited about this too. .
@_date: 2016-06-05 04:31:38
You could always have someone else buy it for you and then send it to you. I did this for my cousin. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 01:37:10
I was pretty excited about this project, but you're right, he's a crazy person. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 01:51:08
@_date: 2017-08-02 00:22:06
I am going to split my coins using my trezor coin splitter, where can I sell my bitcoin cash for ethereum or bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-11 03:33:50
That was actually a pretty good video!
@_date: 2016-12-09 22:11:20
lol I don't think he gets it

Just voted Trump, hope to god Hillary doesn't win. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 00:02:36
I only bought a small amount to test the platform and and it was about 2-3% above spot. If you buy at least 0.5 bitcoin you can get  1% above spot in the US right now. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:46:12
@_date: 2016-12-20 20:57:06
I just used bitsquare and it went very smooth. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 00:02:51
For sure!
@_date: 2016-11-27 00:25:31
@_date: 2016-12-09 22:11:03
lol you're not to bright are you
@_date: 2016-12-09 22:14:28
lol I still don't think he gets it. 
@_date: 2016-12-09 22:17:43
Depends where you live, here it would be dollars. If I buy a piece of real estate for $200,000 dollars, hold on to it, and then in two years sell it for $200,000 dollars the property stored value. It's not rocket science. 
@_date: 2016-12-09 22:12:33
lol you are a special kind of arrogant stupid. 
@_date: 2016-11-07 02:41:49
I predict that once bitcoin surpasses its all time high we will be hearing much less of Roger Ver. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 23:43:35
This is my all time favorite post in this sub-reddit. This is the truth. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 19:06:47
my transaction got confirmed, at times of congestion It might not be enough. Hopefully they will upgrade the built in wallet so you can set a higher fee. 
@_date: 2019-02-16 23:46:55
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:40:42
my nigger
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:26:43
Yes, this is why my bags are full of litecoin. It will be cheaper and faster to open a lightning channel on litecoin and then the merchant gets bitcoin through an atomic swap which all happens automatically through the wallet software. 
@_date: 2019-02-19 06:06:22
@_date: 2019-04-08 23:17:55
good luck with that, gonna go buy more bch.
@_date: 2016-09-04 16:06:34
Right? People hate on coinbase, but they are the best in my opinion. 
@_date: 2016-09-09 21:12:15
I say do it, you're young. Maybe open an account on goldmoney.com and hedge with gold as well though.

Blockchain development team: 15 million dollars
Blockchain Advertisement Campaign: 7 million dollars
That moment they realize blockchains are useless without a trusted token in limited supply to fuel the network and closed systems can't compete with open source money....priceless. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:39:13
He is literally telling people mostly to buy and hold the top coins such as bitcoin. Isn't that what most people on this reddit do? Buy and hold bitcoin? sheesh.
@_date: 2016-09-10 16:29:47
That's what I am doing, I think investing the two biggest safest ones is pretty reasonable diversification. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:35:17
Tai Lopez understands the tech and is providing value. He also has been consistently telling people things like bitconnect are most likely scams. His course is for noobs not for people like you and me that are consistently going on r/bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:59:00
no shit sherlock.
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:50:36
He has repeatedly said all the smartest people in crypto told him it was most likely a scam.
@_date: 2016-10-23 22:41:38
No worries bro, keep stacking those coins. It would be best to wait until the real estate bubble pops anyway, and your bitcoin will be worth a hell of a lot more. It's a better idea to rent anyway unless you actually buy the house with cash. 
@_date: 2016-10-29 15:46:20
Madness isn't it.
@_date: 2016-10-08 00:15:45
hahaha so true
@_date: 2016-10-11 19:06:20
I will only buy one if I can buy it with bitcoin, buying it with anything else is just wrong haha. 
@_date: 2016-05-14 18:30:17
It's kind of trippy how fast you get the notification. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 18:18:22
Thank you everyone for sharing! I was wondering about actually simulating a recovery, worked like a charm. Thank you for peace of mind!
@_date: 2016-05-13 18:38:38
I put any btc savings onto my trezor. Coinbase wallet + shift card is then my checking account, I also buy btc through coinbase. 
@_date: 2016-05-13 19:19:16
I didn't even think about the scaling aspect, that's a good point. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:08:34
Extension blocks!
@_date: 2016-05-13 19:14:28
lol everytime you spend btc you are giving away btc. I am not getting fiat, I am getting a good or service in return for btc. The shift card is an intermediary that charges me nothing and in return I get to use btc anywhere they take visa. 
@_date: 2016-05-13 22:07:38
What I really need is a paypal substitute where I can invoice and people can pay with paypal, or fiat and I get bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-07-29 15:56:50
or he could get a shift visa card to use bitcoin anywhere they take visa

@_date: 2016-07-20 17:27:00
broseph, you sure you ain't looking at the top infographic which is showing the latest blocks that have been mined and the total btc transacted in that block? Those aren't single transactions to single addresses.

Because its a mind trap, a true democracy is mob rule. A republic with separation of powers is superior.

Ltc and dgb good as well. I like xmr also.
@_date: 2016-07-20 18:28:20
stared at it for a couple minutes, biggest one I saw was 191 btc
@_date: 2016-07-21 21:47:46
Lol this guy replies like that to every post made about bitcoin debit cards. I am amazed at the length of the replies as well. He's a loony.
