Not everyone here shares the same opinions on everything. Gold's value comes from scarcity and the fact that it doesn't deteriorate and more recently it's electric conductivity makes it valuable for use in electronics. 
Crypto are useful for an interconnected and online world where you want to send money to anyone anywhere in the world without needing to go through a third party like a bank or a Western Union. 
The dollar is locked in to specific countries, need to be converted for most person to business or person to person transactions and are vulnerable to spying and identity theft via their transaction and banking models.

You would have to do that globally. US could ban them but then you could just buy from an exchange running in Germany or Japan or South Korea or Australia or Iceland.

The answer isn't simple, but part of the reason was to balance the money supply vs the low interest rates. If interest rates go up that money should get destroyed. The way QE gets lowered is the Fed buys back bank assets and that money is removed.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:31:30
Could be that 60% of the gain was taxable? I know some places you only pay capital gains on 50% of your total gains, and you pay the same percentage as your tax bracket. To put it in simple terms, let's say you make 10K profits and pay 10% tax, then you are taxed on 5K profits and so you pay $500 in taxes on the 10K you made.

It's true that gold has industrial applications and it's costly to mine and recycle so either way it will have value regardless. Only if we find a way to synthesis gold cheaply or mine asteroids full of gold would it be at risk, and I don't see either happening in the near future.

It doesn't need to be the global power grid, just say the North Eastern US goes out like it did before, but for longer than seen before. Gold and silver were also what backed the USD till 1971 when Nixon made the 'temporary' move away from the Gold Standard. I'm not preparing for the apocalypse but if there is a currency crisis with fiat then many governments will rush back to gold. France and Germany have already started trying to get their gold back from the US (Which may or may not be there). 
But simply put, I'm just not putting all my eggs in one basket. If gold crashes and never recovers and bitcoin shoots to the moon and beyond then I can probably recoup my losses, same if the reverse happens. Though really as far as gold or silver is concerned I find it's just more useful as a hedge against inflation. Bitcoin for me is good to hold and for privacy in online transactions where I can use it. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 16:54:14
Gold doesn't vanish if the internet and all electronics explode (not likely to happen, but still). I guess more reasonably you could say if the power grid goes down you lose access to your Bitcoin, or possibly just the ability to use Bitcoin in transactions. I personally see the value in both and have bought into both. Both for me are long term holds but bitcoin I use in my day to day for online transactions where gold just accumulates.

So many times in history you have people saying x can't be done only for it to do done fairly easily. I feel like bitcoin has been at that stage, which is good for those who want to accumulate before mass adoption, but I can't wait to see when bitcoin takes over. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 13:17:39

So basically any finite resource is a pyramid scheme. 
A real pyramid scheme is where people at the lower tiers have to pay people on the tier above and so on. If I had to give x% of my profits to some random guy while other people give me a % of their profits then that would be a pyramid scheme. 
In this case it's just early adopters getting rewarded for believing in a technology that's taking over, just like if you bought stocks in a small no name company that becomes the next Google or Amazon.

But that's not what a pyramid scheme is. People come in from the bottom, not the top, and the money funnels from the bottom (many) to the top (few). This is more like stocks where if people want to buy the stocks and the price goes up it forces them to buy at a higher price. Stocks are limited so the more people want it the higher the price goes. Of course stocks have other things affecting price but people buying and selling a finite resource does drive a lot of it.

But there is much more risk for much less reward. With crypto or stocks the chance that you lose absolutely everything is fairly low. You might lose a chunk but you still have something left over.

Often people look at the USD/BTC price, even if they did't buy in USD. So seeing bitcoin dropping by $1000 USD, people then compare that that is in their native currency, which probably had fluctuations since then. If US was worth more at the top, and less at the bottom, the gap is wider.

Gold is only good if you have a lot of money you want to freeze in time, usually when you expect an apocalypse in the stock market. 
Thing is with bitcoin if something like that happens it's much easier to pay and get your bitcoin rather than finding a trusted bullion dealer and getting large amounts of cash in order to buy and then wait for delivery if you're not doing it in person.
Also, you can buy $10 in bitcoin, but I doubt many people are selling $10 worth of gold. 
I think when the next stock market crash happens we'll see a surge in bitcoin (or just crypto in general) use. Though I also foresee lots of scams to take advantage of people who would try and buy in in catastrophic times.

The reason we need inflation is because there is a limit to how small we can divide dollars. If you want everyone to have access to money, and for people to invest in corporations, you need to create more money. Creating more money dillutes it's value which means you need to create more. Having stable inflation is fine, but having to manually controll the money supply means one false step leds you to hyper inflation or deflation.
With bitcoin, it's potentially infinitely divisible. If the amount is stable then the value rises which means you need smaller and smaller fractions of the currency to live off of.

Yeah, multiplied by 1000 not 1400. That means $1 then would be $10000 now. From there you just need to have had 100 to be a millionaire. Almost 2/3rds off.

It's useful and scarce, that's why the price is so high. Gold used to be able to buy much more per ounce, so really it's undervalued (or everything else is overvalued thanks to inflation with fiat and stagnant wages).

That wasn't even a bubble. It barely touched $3000 when it came from like $1500 only to fall back to $2200. That was just a quick rise and an overshoot. Same as if it would fall there would be a slight bounce back because things like this always overshoot a little.  A bubble would have brought us back to $1500 or less.

I think that depends state by state. Some states don't tax gold, but I'm not sure of the legality of buying gold with bitcoin to avoid taxes. I think in most cases if you trade bitcoin for gold you'll have to file capital gains on your bitcoin once you do. But I'm not a finance guy or a lawyer, just what I assume would happen.

This is why I love crypto. There are so many laws and regulations saying "You must be this rich to participate, and you must put in a minimum of hundreds of thousands up front to join".

To be fair, most investors suggest no more than 5% in gold or other precious metals as a hedge in case of a downturn. I wouldn't put more than 5% in gold, and though I initially invested little in crypto, I invested right before the boom (in February) and crypto blew up to become about 50% of my total investments. I sold off a majority of it a few weeks ago, mainly to rebalance by sheets (and some concern over volatility + lots of money made) which I'm glad I did in hindsight. Most of it was ETH.
