Thanks for making the documents available and for your write-up.
What the paper calls "remuneration for miners" you describe as "bribing miners".   Yet isn't it the same as providing a fee discount for segwit transactions?
That is, in both cases, monetary reward is being made available to incentivize the growth of a transaction type across the network.  Thus, would you also describe the fee discount as a bribe?
@_date: 2016-04-21 16:47:59
Can a technical solution to transaction malleability exist on its own?  That is, without a fee discount?  Of course it can.
So why does the fee discount exist?  In the context of our discussion, how can it not be considered anything but a bribe?
Now if one believes the system should reward "good" behaviour, what are the qualifications required to make a moral judgement and proscribe ChainAnchor as a bad thing whereas SegWit is a good thing?
Should the system also offer fee discounts for transactions which send outputs to brand new addresses, never seen before on the network, since this is "good" for privacy?
@_date: 2016-04-21 01:51:18
The fee discount is not for miners; it exists to "remunerate" end-users for sending segwit tx instead of regular tx.

Would you include off-chain transactions in this?
@_date: 2016-04-21 04:49:35
More efficient transactions - for who?  A fully validating node must keep on downloading transaction and signature data, just like it does today.  There is no efficiency gain.  Only nodes which do not validate transactions will benefit from not having to download signature data.

I'm afraid that's not true.  Just last month, at the Digital Currency Conference in San Francisco, it was mentioned twice by the Lightning team on stage, that Lightning does not require Bitcoin and can work with any blockchain.

Mining with commodity hardware is a low entry barrier, so we could see millions of solo bedroom miners and perhaps hundreds if not thousands of small clusters/farms around the world, each with their own local advantage whether it be internet connectivity or cheap energy. Speaking of which, it's $0.02/kwh up in Washington: 
@_date: 2016-01-20 22:38:45
With mining tuned to general purpose computers, the entry barrier is lowered so that anybody can start organizing commodity hardware into clusters or server farms to mine.   They don't have to spend money buying special hardware to get started.  If hundreds of small scale miners end up controlling the majority of the hashing power, that's a win.  The objective is to decentralize mining from what it is now, with 80% hashing power held by just 4 entities.  Who knows, perhaps the combined power of tens of millions of solo miners will end up with the majority.
@_date: 2016-01-20 23:20:21
Regarding the PR itself, to replace a single hash function with another which can just as easily be implemented in an ASIC does not decentralize mining.  In 6 months time, you would have the same problem.
A few things to consider for a new PoW are memory-hardness and psuedo-random behavior at run-time, such as a different code path and tying the memory cost to current network difficulty. Litecoin used Scrypt but the memory parameters were low and static.

@_date: 2016-01-20 08:42:53
Here is a PoW proposal which can replace SHA256d and change the economics of ASIC mining.  It features memory-bound chained-hashing with the added twist that the memory cost is derived from the current network difficulty.  
@_date: 2016-01-20 17:16:19
People have tried mining on cloud servers but had their instances shut down when detected - the CPU usage is just too high for shared servers and unfair on other customers.  Of course, you could do whatever you want with a dedicated instance but it would be cheaper to kit out your own computer. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 08:36:30
What was the rationale/thinking behind GPU miners vs botnets, given that industrial scale GPU mining farms can/do exist? It's certainly an interesting point to consider.
If you have time, would appreciate any feedback on a new PoW for Bitcoin, FAIR, which increases memory requirements when the network difficulty increases.

A private blockchain would not require a token to incentivize participants to run the software because they would only be invited to join the blockchain if they shared a common purpose with other members.  For example, financial institutions looking to settle business transactions with each other, where the blockchain might reduce settlement costs and processing times over existing methods.

Should you run Bitcoin-XT?
Since Bitcoin-XT is backwards compatible with Bitcoin-Core, if no consensus is reached, nothing changes and its business as usual.  If however, consensus is reached and bigger blocks are mined, Bitcoin-XT will accept the larger blocks whereas Bitcoin-Core will reject them.
Bigger Blocks?|No Consensus|Consensus Reached
It looks like the rational decision is for a node operator to run Bitcoin-XT so they can avoid the risk of being out of sync with the network.
Any game theory experts out there who can provide some insight into the decision faced by node operators?  Thanks.

MultiChain ( is a private blockchain based on Bitcoin-Core and it comes with native permissions and native assets, so you don't need an overlay network.  It's also backwards-compatible with colored coins protocols like CoinSpark and OA, so you can easily move your application from the public blockchain to a private one.

They should be fine.  Litecoin's PoW failed to be ASIC resistant because it used the Scrypt function incorrectly!

Ethereum and Bitcoin share the same fundamental problems - which Rootstock will inherit.
* No guarantee of transaction execution
* Turing-complete smart contracts are slow
* Scaling is a moonshot
* Oracles break the trust model
* Public blockchains struggle to stay decentralized
These problems may be overcome but at what price?  What if it means the smart contracts are no longer running on top of a permissionless, trustless and decentralized public blockchain...?
@_date: 2016-02-20 07:52:18
On point 1, a memory-hard PoW tied to network difficulty could change the economics enough so that it is no longer financially feasible to build ASIC mining farms:

Did you get a chance to review the blog post?  More detail there, but in a nutshell...
(1) Gas price makes for interesting game theory, but businesses want service level guarantees
(2a) Smart contracts which change global state must be executed in sequence and in the exact same order by all nodes to reach consistent results, which means waiting for the next block to arrive with the transaction order.  Parallel processing is not allowed.
(2b) The original  Ethereum model of having every node execute every smart contract doesn't scale - that's why the community is looking at sharding, off-chain computations, etc. (which begs the question, is it still a decentralized smart contract system/blockchain?)

What is the source of your 17% number?  Citation please.
You write in your BIP “if we assume a 17.7% rate of technological improvement” ( yet there is no source or citation for this number.
The same number is referred to in Pieter’s draft BIP, which states “The growth rate of 17.7% growth per year is consistent with the average growth rate of bandwidth the last years” yet the draft does not provide a source or citation for this number.  (
The same number is again used in Rusty's blog post, "The only attempt to attach growth to a metric was Pieter Wuille’s 17.7% per year increase. That takes 70 years to reach everyone-scale, so no relief there in my lifetime."
 (
So where does this magic number come from? A study? What period did it cover? What was being measured? Home broadband connections? Submarine cable capacity? How do we know this number is even relevant to Bitcoin scaling?
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:59:18
Thanks for the clarification. Might be worth removing that figure from any BIPs if it can't be sourced.

It's irresponsible of the media to repeat claims linking Bitcoin with the Paris attacks given the lack of evidence.  Perhaps journalists are simply chasing clicks.  Maybe they're intentionally trying to grind down Bitcoin [1].
Regardless, we should acknowledge that there is a grain of truth in the headlines because Bitcoin is the canary in the coal mine for what's coming: truly anonymous cryptocurrencies [2].
