Advice: use a platform that won't give you charge backs because if it's a fraudster that is buying from you, you're fked

It is somewhat instant, in that once you use your bank account on it, the money is placed on margin in your account, so you can buy bitcoins instantly. But you would not be able to transfer the money out till the money has cleared from both your bank and on Gemini's end. Which takes a max of 5 business days. Verification is done using a Govt issued card and a Utility Bill (Phone bill, Electricity bill, e.t.c).

Gemini.com (personal fav), Coinbase is quite good since they have their own exchange (GDAX, but people complain about how crappy their limits are, use bank wires if you want to move a large amount of money), I have actually used Uphold, aside from their ACH clearing time, I haven't had a problem with them

The verification took me about a total of about a day but normally it is less than 2 hours (a friend told me). It took me a day because I didn't have a bill in my name (College Student)

I have a question, is it normal to have a $250/wk limit on Bank and $50/wk limit on Card with a completely verified account with regular activity? I ask this because I have gone through the thread and I see people with higher limits that are verified and opened an account the same time as me.

Ok so you can wire money to Coinbase USD Wallet by simply navigating to the Wallet and looking for Deposit at the top right corner and from the drop down, select Wire and follow the instructions at your Bank, make sure to include the additional message. Normally, I would recommend something like gemini.com but since you need it asap, Coinbase is going to be a necessary evil. Or you can buy bitcoins from xCoins.io using Paypal or your card but it comes with a high interest rate.
