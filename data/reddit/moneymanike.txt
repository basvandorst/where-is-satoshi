As a trader my only advice to you guys is to take a step back and look at what you're saying. The number one reason for holding Bitcoin is people saying to hold Bitcoin and that it'll go back up. If this was any other stock I'd date my money and run (which I did from $100 to $1k).
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:09:34
My understanding was that Bitcoin was a store of value. Sure it's not a "stock" but nobody would get pissy if you called gold a stock. Either way if this is how the community behaves I don't see why anybody would buy into this except for greed.

Compared to other cons it's adoption is tanking.

But why would I do that if Bitcoin will soon be worth over $100k+. It's like I'm giving away millions.
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:19:20
Ehh that doesn't include the miners and exchanges that have to sell for fiat.
@_date: 2018-08-12 05:17:32
Not even an hindsight thing. You're an idiot who got lucky. Universe lined everything up for you and you blew it with your greed. From $14k to $140k and yet you didn't bail. News flash no one but founders hold traditional investments through orders of  magnitudes unless it's a bluechip.
@_date: 2018-08-09 14:19:19
If 3+ years then what's the the point. I can name dozens of bluechip household name stocks that have more then doubled, tripled, quadrupled, etc in the past 5 years. The point of speculation is increased risk for quick money. Not long term holding.
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:25:29
I still don't understand what your point is. The only way you did 250X is if you bought less than $100 and sold the $20k ATH. That puts you in the realm of the 1% of the 1%. That's the same as someone holding Apple or other bluechips just over a much longer time period. Hence why people are drawn to gambling on speculative assets, and hindsight is 20/20 most people lost money. The problem starts to occur when people start treating speculative assets as low risk assets by "bagholding" and "averaging down". You have no basis at all as to why it's wait just 3 years besides the fact that it happened before. Also the only people who got screwed in 2008 were people entering retirement without ever diversifying to lower risk assets. Anyone who's held through 2008 is fine because bag holding bluechips is completely different than bag holding cryptocurrency.

This is old news the ability to buy and sell BTC has been on cash app for almost a year now.

@_date: 2018-05-11 18:28:09
It varies by exchange but I posted a link above. 80-90% is my personal guess based on that article (and others which include the tether dilemma) and what I physically see in the market. The market couldn't even absorb the Mtgox liquidation simply because the volume isn't real. Even if it was real looking at the GDAX market depth, liquidating 8,000 BTC would send Bitcoin to $4-$5k assuming no new money comes in. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 15:01:39
I'm sorry for your loss
@_date: 2018-05-11 15:34:39
Lol it is already known that 80-90% of BTC trading is wash trading. So the true volume is really around 100,000 BTC and it shows. So he really moved 8% but that's not the only reason why it's tanking.
@_date: 2018-08-05 00:53:07
Lol no it doesn't. A few million and you can take crypto in any direction you want. You better hope it's in the direction you want

Still wrong. Both metrics are essentially meaningless without both quantities.

There are plenty of services out there that will do it for free if it's not on credit but yeah the typical limitation is what $2.5k? I guess that's where BTC fits I could send $50k and pay no fee but I'm under why someone would do that much without having a 3rd party escrow.
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:10:46

Fundamental analysis but that doesn't apply to crypto. Day trading crypto will surely result in loss of funds.

No I mean the Crypto asset class is heavily manipulated.
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:30:39
It's a breakout formation. But a breakout that can go either direction. Traditionally you can see what the market thinks using short interest and options trading but with crypto it's even more unguided gambling. There is no reason why it will go into a reversal unless the manipulators want it to, yet there are a lot of reasons why the downtrend will continue.

This post is such bullshit. It's risk vs reward. The guy already had a business that failed and if Apple failed the loans Jobs took out would have had to all be paid by him since Jobs and Woz had no assets. His total compensation in today's time for his exit was $10k. He wasn't willing to take the risk which is totally fine. It's up to YOU and only YOU too decide if anything you do is worth the risks involved. There are many people in similar situations who didn't exit and lost their homes, savings, etc.

What you call hodlers are traditionally called bag holders. Rarely do bag holders come out green. Cutting losses and reinvesting is sometimes good.

Smh, use your brain. If the "currency" is deflationary why would it be used as a currency, and not hoarded like it's being promoted now with "hodl". That is why it's transitioned from a "digital currency" to a "store of value". It has nothing to do with high fees. Businesses that accept BTC said they don't get many transactions. The transactions you see publicly are people moving BTC among themselves, it's no longer a currency. Once the general consensus is that it's worthless Bitcoin essentially goes to zero or crashes. This can't happen with traditional measures of storage of value because the metric is associated with an actual tangible unique value. It's a game of pure greed, and is the reason why BTC has such a high sigma. It will never be stable due to human psycology.

As a poster on r/buttcoin the point is to provide cynicism. As someone who bought in around 2013 and has since sold for a  decent profit Bitcoin now is very different than it used to be. Anyone who has been here years ago and is smart knows that the original Bitcoin died long ago and what we have now will die eventually too.

Meh as a trader I'll tell you this. Technical analysis is not supposed to be some trading commandment that'll make you rich, all it does is help tell you a story and with that story it's up to you to determine how it goes. The more people that believe in the technicals that tell the story the more powerful the technicals are. Every technical has a purpose and it's own strength and doesn't have to be used on the way up, some stocks even have respect for certain technicals more so than others. So no technicals won't make you rich but it increases your odds of winning trades or closing trades that will be big losers. People don't understand this because "Chartists" either don't know this themselves and are losers, or they simply don't want to take trading risks and so they sell these things to people as if it's some golden rule that is always followed. I wish I had a link but there was a long term "chartist" who took the time to calculate the probabilities of the outcome of different fundamental patterns and you essentially could statistically win over the long term by hedging and taking calculated bets.

I don't think you guys understand how economics work at all. A 80% drop in an asset worth millions in market cap is scary but a possibility if something bad happens, think of a smallcap company, it happens every now and then in traditional markets. A 50% drop in something that's supposed to have billions in market cap is a strong sign that something is fundamentally wrong. Yes percentages can be compared but the reason behind them can have pretty different meanings. Luckily traditional assets get some help due to inflation, not sure what will happen in Bitcoins case.

"They also have people who do mathematical modelling and use data science and machine learning etc to look for patterns and trends"
Lmfao let me tell you this. Most of these computerized hedge funds don't beat the market and the few that do its not by much, some are also most definitely cheating. The reason why most lose is for the same reason why day traders, (even the pros) struggle. The  "Mathematical modeling, data science, and machine learning" (lets be honest its TA and charting on steroids) has its drawbacks. The successful day traders are able to recognize their success and transition to selling their success because they know what happens to most day traders long term.
