...why don't you just take your gigantic balls and go do some more peer-to-peer transfers on your sinking ship, boyo.
@_date: 2018-08-09 20:23:50
so a four-time pump-and-dump scheme. that makes it better?  
...what you fail to take into account is that those huge bullruns were only possible because of NEW blood--people who hadn't witnessed the previous catastrophic crashes.  
crypto reached the saturation point last year. then it shit the bed...and everybody knows.  
there's no coming back from that.  
@_date: 2018-08-08 07:04:20
you have nothing better to do with your time?  
Venezuela's inflation is one of the big "humanitarian" talking points for Bitcoin shills pretending to care about "making the world a better place."
@_date: 2018-08-08 07:44:30
i'm sure most of them weren't dumb enough to hold such a shitty asset--unlike most crypto HODLers around here.  
(there are a million and one more stable things they could use as commodities than BTC.)
@_date: 2018-08-10 07:38:24
...can you even read or use a fucking price chart?  
he didn't say sell at $3500. ...BTC reached 3500 on August 8 and never dipped towards 2900 again: if it *had*, then, yeah, it probably would have been wise to dump.  
...maybe this level of critical thinking is why you kids are still hodling at -70%
@_date: 2018-08-08 07:48:46
Adolf Hodler did many things that were wrong: HODLing wasn't one of them.

Ah, I see. ...It took me a while to sift through your baffling grammar.   
OK...so you speak English reasonably competently and your name is "nerdvegas." I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you're not simply another American self-hater....  
Canadian?   
Limey?   
Wallaby-Fucker?   
...So, then, your Exhibit A is our "15 percent" huddled masses?  
**Oh...that percentage that benefits dollar-for-dollar *the most* from our tax-funded education, police and fire protection, public transportation, roads and bridges and sidewalks and other infrastructure, and health services?**  
Please, kind stranger, tell me all about your miraculously low poverty rate. (And, as a bonus, it would be nice if you threw in your demographic info--i.e. the percentage of your population that is ethnically *non*-homogenous.)  
And as for our "dead schoolchildren," ...so good of you to remember those poor souls.  
...I didn't realize Bitcoin could prevent school shootings...but I'd *love* to hear your theories all about that as well.   
[Of course, by "love" I really meant "not give a shit" ... but please feel free to enlighten everyone else here with your knowledge on this! ...TEDx talk if necessary.]  
*G'day, ya fuckin drongo.*

...come on, *mate*, what magical land do you live in that is immune from the "culture war" between feminazis, he-man-woman-haters, race-baiters, neo-nationalists, true-believers, gender-wizards, 4G busybodies, and snowflakes?
@_date: 2018-08-09 21:46:32
go find a random guy on the street,  
show him a lifetime chart of BTC,  
ask if he'd like to get in on "the opportunity of a lifetime,"  
...and then get back to us on how that goes.

@_date: 2018-08-12 03:22:55
...maybe you mean *2018*?  
many, many "shitcoins" did way better than BTC last year.
@_date: 2018-08-21 01:37:57
...but crypto inflation is cool.

...i'm guessing he's the Poor Dad
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:55:01
i'll say it again: you do not understand how volume and market cap work *at all* ... and i'm not going to spend any time trying to explain it to you.  
go do some reading...and *then* think up a better way to spend your (and every one else's) 5 dollars--even if it is McDonald's.  
*in fact, buying a Big Mac right now is a WAY better investment than crypto!*  
@_date: 2018-08-08 07:30:57
...i was just being sarcastic about the fact that some very foolish people have suggested that somehow cryptocurrency would help third-world citizens like Venezuelans.  
(not to mention that it's a ridiculous form of currency under any circumstances.   
...why not just use your Tesla stock to pay for your groceries? ...lot of idiots around here.)
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:07:58
...so tell whales *exactly* how much volume increase they can count on each week?  
*brilliant idea!*
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:30:59
shut the fuck up already.
@_date: 2018-08-14 06:43:07
sarcasm.  
see above.
@_date: 2018-08-08 05:10:27
eh...only about 68%.  
(but at least they got to fuck that pie.)
@_date: 2018-08-09 20:34:26
...in the sense that DVDs have become worthless, i think it's a good comparison.
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:30:56
the thing is, as we've pointed out, that amount--on a Bitcoin-scale--won't mean shit.  it won't move the needle *at all*.   
merely a futile effort and a waste of yet more of everybody's money. 
  
go look carefully at recent BTC charts showing volume.
@_date: 2018-08-21 01:34:26
my fave is: "I'm not *buying cryptocurrency*: I'm *throwing all my money into a fucking blender and then setting it on fire*."
@_date: 2018-08-08 03:55:24
yeah? ...wanna buy some of mine?  
discount at $10,000 each.

"here, junkie. ...have some more hair of the dog that bit you!"
@_date: 2018-08-21 01:35:31
nah, bro. they're making a new country in their country.
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:19:59
you don't seem to have a good grasp on BTC's market cap. 
...anyway, if you could reliably pool $4.5 million every week, a *good* investment destination for that would be BITCOIN? jeez, man....
@_date: 2018-08-21 01:39:37
Bitcoin is the pin that bursts its own bubble.  
*Far out, man.*
@_date: 2018-08-21 01:36:44
yeah ... but not this one, commie.
@_date: 2018-08-21 05:29:43
...Sweet rebuttal, bro.  
I was only kidding, of course. JUST HODL!
@_date: 2018-05-27 05:49:04
....better store of value than BTC.
@_date: 2018-08-08 06:52:21
...wait a minute.  
so you're saying an extremely volatile asset is a terrible form of currency?  
@_date: 2018-08-08 06:15:38
yeah, when *you* are down $18,000, then you can tell someone he's weak.  
(he's just dumb--like you.)
@_date: 2019-04-03 03:55:36
yeah...because losing 90% of one's assets is a good strategy.
@_date: 2019-04-03 03:53:33
...if it was drug money...they can.
@_date: 2019-04-03 06:59:53
no?  
 
@_date: 2019-04-03 03:57:55
ya should have been hanging with drug-dealing felons instead, i guess. well...live and learn.

@_date: 2018-12-13 08:56:06

is that the reason you didn't cash out at 19,000?

@_date: 2018-12-13 21:19:04
10 years? that sounds pretty good considering it's already been alive for 20 years...and considering that your "world-changing currency" has imploded yet again--in less than 12 months going from peak saturation to utter self-destruction

4% ...how's that?
@_date: 2018-12-13 09:23:47
...don't you just feel sad after you say these things?
@_date: 2018-12-13 09:22:18
BTC?  
a. why at all?  
b. WHY would you even use Coinbase to buy BTC?  
c. why BTC in particular...since it's going to cost you more than any of the others to move anyway?
@_date: 2018-12-13 09:25:06
...but what does Paypal have that Coinbase doesn't already have?
@_date: 2018-12-13 09:34:43
...do you have some constantly de-valuing BTC on Coinbase that you'd like to convert instantly into something of actual value on Ebay? well, then, now you can. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 09:29:45
...i'm glad Coinbase would never close your account or ask for documentation at the drop of a hat.  
also...how have you been trading crypto without a bank account, incidentally?
@_date: 2018-12-13 09:08:52
--yeah, it's not like Paypal handles $1 trillion of payments a year...or is the primary processor of one of the world's biggest e-commerce sites or something.  
hell, i doubt its market cap is even close to crypto's!
@_date: 2018-12-13 09:14:57
...there's no reason for any: you're moving your money from (Coinbase's) bank to (Paypal's) bank.  they should love to hold more of your dollars.  
it costs nothing to deposit from your regular bank to Paypal.  
--would like to hear first-hand experiences, though.
@_date: 2018-12-14 06:04:17
ahh, i see. this is r/Bitcoin after all.  
so Bitcoin isn't trash? interesting theory.
@_date: 2018-12-13 09:36:10
...yeah, but you can't hide from the tax man on Paypal though.
