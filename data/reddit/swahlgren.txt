If Tether isn't backed by dollars it's no better or worse than 90% of the shitcoins on CMC. Doesn't seem to hold them back.

How would they do that? If they were to include high fee transactions they'd have to pay the fee themselves and will lose it if the block is mined by someone else.

You gotta go through btc or eth for most trading pairs. Helps with the volume.

When people don't pay for their education themselves, they tend to value personal interest and convenience over career options and thus waste loads and loads of tax dollars on useless education. Where I work a few  of the secretaries have master's degrees in literature, history etc. Do you think the money for their education is being put to good use?
When people spend their own money on themselves the ROI is optimal.

Not at all, I'm simply looking for a place to acquire the book in a format compatible with my e-reader. I bought "Mastering Bitcoin"  in the Kobo store but "The Internet of Money" isn't there.

I live in Denmark too and know a ton of people that are against the way education is financed here. 
It's true that the state can't survive without taxes but you are sadly mistaken when you equate state with society.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:02:27
Thanks for telling me who I know. :D
No state has ever survived without taxes because that's the single stream of funds of a state. However, society is not the same as the state. That you confuse the two shows that the brainwashing works. ;)

Who are these "people"? If getting education doesn't enable a person to pay for the education themselves, then what's the point? There's a word for that and it's called a hobby. Don't expect others to pay for your hobbies.

Again, who are these "people"? You're oblivious if you think everyone agrees with your personal opinion. And if a majority actually does, then why should those that don't be forced to take part in it?

Social mobility is a measurement of the relative change of income. Going from earning 1 dollar a day to 5 dollars a day will display the same mobility as moving from 100 to 500 dollars a day. Thus, coming to final conclusions based on mobility alone is missing the big picture.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:21:30
No. Why would anybody pay anything to give up control of Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:41:41
Education is a hobby if it doesn't turn in to a career.
The graphic doesn't show what you seem to believe it does. Inequality doesn't say anything about living standard. In a country where everybody is equally poor there can still be a high level of equality. On the other hand, a country might come up as highly unequal if the whole population is rich but some are much richer than others.
Also, "mobility" doesn't say anything about the absolute change in income of the population, only the relative change.

So what you're saying is that you've fitted a curve to historical prices of Bitcoin and find that the curve correlates very well to the data is has been created from? Astonishing.

I'd love to see that graph. :D

Can you provide a reference to your claim?

Sound like a few guys in these comments are gonna get rich. I presume that they've shorted the shit out of BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:13:37
Buy bitcoins now LOL."
The expectation if Bitcoin futures is already baked in to the current price. Everybody knows that futures are a big deal for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:54:15
It's related to the price miners are willing to pay for mining. As far as I see it miners have zero if any impact on the price of BTC unless if you consider attacks on the network of course.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:26:38
Except it would fork from the Bitcoin blockchain which makes all the difference.
The ten minute timecap seems quite arbitrary and since we're dealing in petahash/s there's still a ginormeous amount of hashes created over a timespan of maybe a minute.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:20:31
Thanks. Can you be more specific though? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:53:30
I'm sure it hasn't but I'd like to understand why.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:42:46
It seems to be an inherent problem related to the way PoW is used. Dictating that it must take 10 minutes to mine a block obviously pushes energy expenditure up and it should only get worse if Bitcoin keeps increasing in value. 
I wonder if there is a way around it cause already a big issue with regard to sustainability at this early stage.
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:58:14
Just tried changelly and they want almost 1 eth for swapping 10 btc for eth. That's way too expensive.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:45:14
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:41:30
If you understand it you should be able to explain why. ;)

The hypothetical situation aside, how long does it take for a block to propagate?

Again, to the vast majority this is not an issue. I love Bitcoin but I suspect it will never go mainstream simply because there's no great demand for what it can do.

In part probably for the same reason most don't make their own mayonnaise even though it's quite easy: They simply don't want to be bothered.

Conveniently forgetting the 2-year bear run that followed when BTC went berserk in 2013.
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:48:13
That's a good use case for Bitcoin but the volume is insignificant compared to regular visa purchases.
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:07:19
It does but Bitcoin transactions too cost a fee.
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:43:28
I was referring to that for a lot of people, bitcoin doesn't offer anything of value.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:06:52
Ok, but why increase block size and thus create BCC and B2X instead of doing what I propose? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:49:24
You might be right but 95% of the world's population doesn't care or think about those things.
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:04:52
Still, we're back to having what Visa and PayPal already offer but with the added risk of losing everything if the keys are lost and no way of getting your funds back if you mess up a transaction. For everyday use by regular people I just don't see it happening.
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:35:01
I'm not sure why you're being so aggressive about this. I wrote that USEFUL information has value, not that any information does.
But actually your piece of paper might be of value to a person needing to know the value of pi. However, in your case  the information would be readily available from many alternative sources rendering your piece of paper relatively worthless.
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:14:02
Haven't gotten around to it yet though.

It could be any record such as ownership of property but in reality any information where validity is valued. That's what the whole blockchain hype is about: decentralization of records while maintaining validity.

Well, that's what I'm doing. No need to reinvent the wheel if someone with more insight can enlighten me. I also didn't learn calculus by studying the original works of Newton and Leibniz but used a much better textbook instead. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:54:34
I don't know the technical details of the BTC blockchain. That's why I'm asking in the first place. It could be any type of information really, e.g. college diplomas, land ownership etc.
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:05:35
The value bearing tokens are of course the incentive for miners to verify the info and form the blockchain.
Like I said I don't know the technical details and was just wondering if other info could be "slipstreamed" in to the blockchain to add additional value. :)
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:07:28
Useful information is generally highly valued.

Politics is a mean to gaining or retaining power. How does S2x change the power balance within the BTC realm?
Is it not about power but just a matter of groups of people with different opinions wanting to draw the longest straw in order to get the bragging rights?
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:14:41
It doesn't have to be needed by everybody, just by some. Also, it's ok for it to leak out but then it loses the validity the blockchain provides.

Apart from the users, the exchanges actually have the most power in the event of a fork. Most will consider BTC as the real deal regardless of the tech behind it and the real deal will prevail.

That doesn't answer my question regarding the possibility of adding information to the BTC blockchain though. :)
We could instead refer to it as increasing the intrinsic value.

And they are. User will opt for the token they consider the best at the given price. Without users the miners don't make money.
Miners signaling S2X is equivalent to physical miners saying they will only mine silver, but if requires the same effort relative to yield as mining gold, sticking to silver is just plain stupid and those miners will either go out of business or be forced to switch. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:47:21
I think something like the B-symbol in the center of some circuit stuff (like on the coin in the picture here)  shaped like a coin might be cool. I mean a flat geometry with coinesque circuit board stuff. But that'd never catch on cause it can't be piled on top of say a stack of dollar bills.
