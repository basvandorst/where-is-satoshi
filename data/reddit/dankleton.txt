I have some comments / things to think about.
First off is the traditional [Relevant XKCD](
You say that your OS would include more secure DNS.  What threats are you securing against?
Have you considered the "internet of things"?  This refers to large numbers of very low power (both in terms of watts and in terms of CPU) devices all connecting to the network.  If they are going to be required to support encryption to connect to the network it will increase their power consumption.
Do you have a firm list of the problems which you are trying to solve as well as an understanding of how those problems arose in the first case?  Understanding the choices and accidents which led to those problems might help make sure they don't get repeated.

I too regret not being able to see into the future.

I just used the headline from the press release - essentially they are regulating Bitcoin in the same way as cash in a number of ways for businesses.

At those prices buyers will be a long way from breaking even.  
In 2 days mining at 1.6GH/s you would expect to get about 0.002BTC - which is worth about $1.60 at today's prices - at a cost of $4.99.
Or am I missing something?

Get legal advice.  Seriously.

So far I've bought one SSD drive from  - but whenever I'm looking to buy something online I check if there is anyone who accepts bitcoins before paying any other way.

This might not be revolutionary, but have you asked Bitpay if they can help?
Here's how I see it happening:
1) Customer pays Bitpay 1BTC for a $1000 fridge, Bitpay pay you $1000, customer gets a fridge.
2) Customer returns fridge 2 days later when 1BTC is worth $1200.  You inform Bitpay and return $1000 to them (which was what they sent originally,) Bitpay sends the customer 1BTC.  Assuming that Bitpay doesn't convert coins to fiat straight away and instead holds some then nobody will have lost out.
The customer could abuse this by trying to buy the fridge again at the lower BTC price, but I think you'd be well within your rights to tell them no at that point.

He must have been upset when the December crash turned his $5000 into just $150000.

The vendors were also told that the BTC was going to be used to buy stolen credit card details ([source]( so there might be a bit more to the story than just "government thinks that BTC are dodgy"

I don't disagree with you that they used the wrong adjective, and I do agree that the Telegraph article is ridiculous scaremongering, but things which are disruptive to the economy are not necessarily good and could, in fact, be dangerous.

It's nowhere near starting to stabilize - that graph shows a 400% increase over 2 months.  I think when the price move over three months stays within +/-20% then we can start talking about whether it is stable.
Stability is a great thing for Bitcoin as a currency.  It means that you can spend your coins and not be thinking "if I hadn't bought that pizza last month I'd have an extra $100 worth of coins now."  It's less good for Bitcoin as an investment vehicle because it means that there is less chance for people to make money on the coins themselves.  And for the overall ecosystem which is made up of both of these?  I have no idea.

That depends on what you mean by "believing in what they are doing."
It looks to me like BTC is aiming to do to finance what the internet did to communications - be very disruptive and change the world.
It looks to me like Doge is about being silly and having fun.  If BTC fails to shake the financial world to its core it won't stop people having fun with Doge.
On the other hand, some people do seem to believe that the world is going to end up using Doge and I disagree with that - history shows that people like a certain amount of seriousness in their money.

You lie!  The Hampster Dance will NEVER die!

Nice work!
I found last night that I'd got 1.6BTC on an old PC (I thought it was more like 0.3) which left me quite pleased.

Pump and Dump is the Winklevii going on CNBC and calling Bitcoin "Gold 2.0" WITH THE INTENTION OF SELLING.
What explained was the "Pump" part.  If they went on CNBC and called it "Gold 2.0" and then sold a load of coins because of the resulting bump in value, they would also have done the "Dump."
