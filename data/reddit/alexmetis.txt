Just a normal correction. Nothing can only go up. It has to go down at one point. It will go up again
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:37:38
We are very far from where bitcoin will be in even a month. Correction was supposed to happen. I dont own bitcoin since im here fir the tech and believe more in ethereum but bitcoin is definitely not at its peak

Open an online account on an overseas bank like epayments or something. They actually accept btc there. Thats how i came into crypto. Dont worry for taxes. Anyone trying to avoid taxes can if he really search the infos. Ill never pay taxes on cryptos. No way fucktard government or banks will get a dime from my cryptos. They didnt help me to get them.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:26:48
If you make enough cash with crypto to be affraid of taxes then you probably will have enough to open an account in jersey islands or Singapore or even better luxembourg. Until you can, consider you didnt make enough to exit crypto 
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:20:43
Whats the point to even post this? You clearly dont get the while concept. Crypto are not here to forcefully replace FIAT but to give an alternative.

People use BTC every day for online transactions. The fact you dont doesn't mean it's useless. Some use to pay services online, some use it to hide their money for whatever reason, some use it as an investment... it took years for credit cards to be accepted. Big changes take time

I guess the dip is making everyone nervous ��
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:44:52
I use bittrex.  What exchange do you use usually? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 10:35:27
So? Set a stop loss and a take profit. I don't see where's the problem.  You can't set both at the same time like on metatrader if thats your question
@_date: 2017-08-24 10:14:17
I never used SL as I'm a day trader but if you think about selling to a higher price point then i guess the "sell equal or above than" option is your way to go
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:14:18
Yeah you can  make a SL on bittrex by choosing "condition" in the sales section of your coin and choose "equal or less than" then set your sales up and you're done

But he's right though. Bitcoin is not really futureproof at its stage now. If states put their noses in crypto they will push on crypto some kind of controls. And i am not a pro but reading on it make me think about ethereum being the front runner soon. The development of DApps alone show more promising tech than bitcoin. Which is finally the most important? The all exchange game between investors or the tech behind all this money game? It reminds me of the old explorer war. Altavista yahoo google or whatever. At the end Google won against what were already giants because their vision was really futuristic. Your life in one place. So i guess for crypto its the same and probably pretty soon. So what the world will adopt? A clustered tech like bitcoin or a tech that most young dev are looking forward to and challenging each other? Because the deep tech world is actually looking at ethreum not bitcoin. Only investors look at bitcoin and they couldn't save Yahoo.

Yes but the pump in not over yet. Keep your eyes on both bcc and btc and find the good moment. Ot still can go down
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:02:26
Lands for btc? Damn wish i could buy

Been there already. Stop spamming reddit with dumb excitment. Keep your shills for when it will hit 10k
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:53:22
Theres a post like this at every 1k milestone. Entered crypto in july when btc was 1700. Yes 1700. Bought 5 and sold 4 at 5000 thinking it will dip. Still waiting for a real dip. But thats not happening and it wont happen. Just hodl. Btc did x8 since i entered crypto and theres absolutely no hints of a dip. More money will come to crypto in 2018 and despite all the forks and all the news, theres no reason for btc to not do a x10 by same time next year. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:50:57
At one point they should understand that we dont give a fuck. Those guys are hilarious.

Come on. A simple Google research will give you at least 5 of the biggest atm manifacturer. One of the biggest is in spain

Wow got BTC since 2013 but on reddit only for 2 months...
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:34:05
First off, you are not buying stocks with crypto. Stocks entitle you to a share of a company and dividends. Coins don't.  Then your best read as a beginner would be forex for dummies. Reading it will make you a better trader than most of the new traders here. Its not only about sell and buy but being able to read a chart correctly and act upon it. Also avoid to do the same mistake than 90% of the redditor. Your coin is not going to moon in a week or 2. Be patient, you're buying coins for new tech, even google didn't made it in a year. Good luck
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:35:22
I see. Yeah never realized that. Thanks
@_date: 2017-10-31 07:51:32
Which country? VPN maybe?
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:16:00
Trust both. Both stance are valid. Invest. But with care
@_date: 2017-10-04 10:02:51
Bittrex allows stop loss. Im using it daily. Of course it doesn't work fast enough in case of massive dump wall
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:56:07
Aight ok i didnt get that. Need to pimp my knowledge about those cryptos. I definitely didnt get the whole picture as i thought all crypto were decentralized using blockchain
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:17:20
So whats your take about ETH? I dont understand how can ETH be 300 with a better tech than btc. I feel like in the middle of the browser war when everybody was buying yahoo while google was cheap. I stock up ETH now. Just to say not so long ago when btc was 400 eth was 10 so btc did x10 while eth did x30. What do you think?
@_date: 2017-10-31 08:02:13
Haha algeria. You're safe mate. What they can really do? Develop a big firewall so you can't use a vpn? Nah they ain't gonna do shit. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:32:41
Kraken I guess. They do GDP 
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:46:51
Ha really? Didnt know that. So why people are talking ot near holland?
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:28:35
True yes. But in the long run. And i mean 5 years. Dont you think eth had a better future?
Im not a pro tech guy. Just feelings about eth vs btc. If theres even a match
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:47:26
Yeah if they entered the market before december and that 20k value. Yeah bitcoin is doing bad. If they came before the gold rush last year when bitcoin was 1000 then its doing good
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:20:25
Funny you said that cause remember altavista and yahoo were far ahead of google. But we don't see them anymore. Id keep stacking eth
