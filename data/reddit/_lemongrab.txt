What should you do with 10k+ instead?

Care to expand on this? When you guys say full node, do you mean we've downloaded the blockchain, update it every day and run it like a bittorent? Because what I just described is what I'm doing.
If that's the case --- I wanted to know what you meant about &gt;8 connections. *whoosh*
@_date: 2015-12-17 02:07:00
Redirecting ports? Keep it running at &gt;8? Do you have to do something special for these two things?

How did you do the gift card purchase?
@_date: 2015-12-14 07:50:19
Is the 21 computer even worth buying @ $400?

@_date: 2015-12-16 01:46:39
Can someone give a layman a little explanation? To me it sounds like you can invest in the company.. with bitcoin? Does that mean they give you bitcoin if they do well..? Or they just want your bitcoins.. I'm so confused.

What makes bitcoin price go up? I don't actually understand why it's similar to a commodity??
@_date: 2015-12-16 17:59:15
I'm also asking this on another thread: What makes bitcoin price go up like a commodity or like a stock? I cannot wrap my head around it?
@_date: 2015-12-13 01:41:20
I don't =(

I just purchased a Raspberry Pi 2! It's coming in a couple of days. Could you point me towards how I would get something similar up and running? I couldn't follow your link unfortunately!
@_date: 2015-12-22 06:54:16
I just use bitcoin-qt because I don't know any better. I want to get another but I've been researching every day and it's difficult to make a decision lol

Wow that sounds really risky with how much bitcoin ~~could~~ *edit* will? blow up. I've never even bought anything from them, haha.
@_date: 2015-12-16 01:42:52
Can we all just stop and appreciate that the link is bitcoins coke? lol
@_date: 2017-02-01 02:45:37
Can someone explain to me something about holding?
I get that you're supposed to buy low and sell high - but if you sell high you're just getting money that most of you don't want to use anyway, right?? This is what I'm not getting. I know some people became millionaires off of this, but is there some sort of threshold where you sell this crypto for something else to cash it in? I thought this was supposed to be a universal currency, but most people treat it like a stock?
Why not treat it like a stock like most people are doing? I guess I can't wrap my head around that.
P.S. Anyone willing to inform a noob on getting a measly amount of bitcoin off his wallet into something better? I only have bitcoin core wallet on a 2nd hard drive, but I want to upgrade my comp soon and I imagine that my wallet will disappear/be in limbo if I don't move it off the hard drive?
@_date: 2017-02-16 05:54:33
I still don't understand how bitcoin can get more valuable over time. How is it not like a "stock" or a tradeable commodity at that point? 
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:57:12

Is the VM necessary? &gt;_&lt;
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:43:13
So where does BCC come from..? It will appear in my wallet NEXT TO my bitcoin? This is what I'm confused about.
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:22:44
I'm so fucking confused. If I do nothing, what happens? Do I lose my bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:09:21
Why do these gigantic growths happen? Does anyone know? Is it because it is being used? 
Is it because it is being mined? 
Is it because people are buying it? 
Is it supply/demand? 
Did the fees get lower due to the split recently?
@_date: 2017-08-09 03:16:27
Now that it's here - what the fuck is it?
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:18:10
This is what I've been trying to grasp ever since I first bought bitcoin. We basically just have to hold onto it until it's worth a ton and accepted everywhere - then we will be taking fractions of our bitcoin instead of trading it in for other currencies essentially, right?
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:56:22
Ohhhhh! That's the whole point of getting a new wallet, eh?
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:41:12
Everyone who had bitcoin now has BCH? I'm still really fuzzy and I hope I'm not missing out on free monies or free bitcoin because I'm not doing anything after the split.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:56:58


**I wish I was as bold as that guy.**
FTFY hurray!
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:21:12
That's the only reason BTC goes up? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:49:43
How did you handle the taxes and shit?
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:58:39
Venezuela has already done this.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:55:26
Holy shit it's been forever since I saw this lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:31:27
Mmmm.. it was about $2k

TESLA. TESLA! TESLA! HEY EVERYONE, THIS GUY HAS A TESLA OVER HERE!!
See? Nobody cares.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:38:58
Ouch ouch ouch ouch
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:23:21
So does that mean from the previous fork, I just let some money get wasted by not buying more bitcoin with bitcoin cash or whatever it's called? ~____~
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:30:02
Can you expand on this?
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:34:41
This is cute
@_date: 2017-05-13 16:51:55
Care to expand on this, please?
Doesn't it *matter* because the later you convert over the less bitcoin you'll have in the end..?
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:15:11


 
@_date: 2016-07-09 04:01:18
Why not keep them in coin base? Is there a problem with that?
@_date: 2016-07-09 19:31:49
Why would miners continue to mine if it's going to take years to do? It doesn't make sense to me. Haven't they done their part up to this point and can get out happy?
@_date: 2017-06-23 23:26:17
What makes bitcoin price go up? Activity? What's making it stable all of a sudden?
@_date: 2016-07-09 22:24:35
I didn't even understand a little bit of that. Shit.
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:50:16
That's what I first thought when he posted this haha then I realized what he actually meant.
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:11:05
Could you please explain this to me? Say I sell some, what am I supposed to do? During the next tax return period, I report it as what? A gift? Or what?
@_date: 2017-06-07 18:22:51
I don't understand most of your post, starting here:


Lots of cool info!
* From what I read, though: miners aren't.. "mining" like sovling random equations with their equipment - they're facilitating transactions?
* By facilitating transactions, they get to keep the fee and how does one get a reward? That's what I'm not understanding.
* Do you know anything about mining rigs? Are they easy to set up? Are they loud? If you had free electricity, is it worth trying to get into it?
@_date: 2017-06-07 06:49:12
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:30:15
Dude. What is this jobs page on your site?! Actual jobs to be filled around the world or for your site? Both?
@_date: 2016-07-09 03:35:31
Which means? Sorry. I've invested a tiny bit into bitcoin, but only have my blockchain wallet huge file thing and the coinbase account.
@_date: 2016-07-09 02:20:39
Is it smart to hold bitcoin on the coinbase site? I have a hard drive with an old wallet on there. I'm about to update my computer and didn't want to keep this hard drive around. What's the best way to move things over? Sorry for being off topic.
@_date: 2017-06-07 06:49:00
I don't know the rules, so I'll have to look them up I guess lol thanks
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:00:47
Lol I love that - hopium
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:06:54
That's what makes it attractive. It's so deeply divisible even though only 21 million whole coins exist. Their value will skyrocket so .0000001 BTC will still be worth a lot.
At least that's my beginner/basic understanding of what I've read over the years.
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:30:35
Why would you lease it instead of wanting to own it?
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:52:36
Why are there fees and where do they go??
Edit: if anyone can explain exactly what happens and exactly where it goes, the better. I'm super curious. Is this partially how miners get paid?
