They spend 3 years chasing a ghost all in the name if finding the truth. But yet they are terrified to do the same thing to the fed.

I still dont see the significance. Am I missing something??
@_date: 2019-07-29 10:09:56
Did you miss April to June?
@_date: 2019-07-28 10:37:18
Could you imagine how many people would lose their minds if it went that low.
@_date: 2019-07-31 06:29:10
Damn OP.  I want one if those.
@_date: 2019-07-26 08:33:29
Thank you.  That's great.
@_date: 2019-07-28 10:43:12
This run up was too quick and full of unbacked tether.
@_date: 2019-07-29 11:47:13
Yeah I think that's lame as well.    I'm just saying its lame to wish it would happen to push the price up when 1. You probs wouldn't sell at the top before it came back down because it happens so quickly so its irrelevant to you and 2 if you look at bitcoin in the macro sense. All these small price fluctuations mean nothing.
@_date: 2019-07-29 11:41:29
That would be lame and artificial.  Similar to what btc price has been lately thanks to the tether printing.

Exactly!  He admits he doesn't quite understand it fully but where he was 2 years ago to now.  You have to give him credit for his willingness to listen and learn.
@_date: 2019-07-29 05:01:14
Dislike free markets?
@_date: 2019-07-22 20:47:03
LOL.  how many straws did he manage to clutch?
@_date: 2019-07-26 06:49:33
Ok cheers.  I'll shop around for an account who is familiar with bitcoin.    I'm in Brisbane. So if you can reccomend anyone that would be appreciated.
@_date: 2019-07-26 09:51:29
Believe me. If I didnt have to  I wouldn't.  Tax is theft.
@_date: 2019-07-24 04:50:51
Bitcoin to 3k please!!!
@_date: 2019-07-27 05:03:30
Lmao.  Wut?
@_date: 2019-07-24 04:54:19
It reversed so quickly and people were so ready to call the bull run.   I wouldn't be shocked if it dropped to 3k in the next few months.

Does it all fall under CGT?

Relax buddy. I said in the macro scheme of bitcoin these small price fluctuations mean nothing. No one in 10 years is going to be looking at this chart as a significant moment.   I Dont know why you are so mad.   And as for selling at the top. If you can do that that more power to you.

He saw the price prediction on a YouTube video. Went to trading view. Made this chart and posted it claiming 8200-8500.

People said the same thing when BTC was $1 addressing claims BTC will be worth $1000 in the future.
@_date: 2019-07-20 21:33:00
What's strange about the timing??
@_date: 2019-07-28 10:41:40
@_date: 2019-07-20 05:26:35
Remember when bitcoin would moves in the $10's of dollars and people thought that was massive.   Now it moves in the $1000's.    Eventually it will move in the $10,000s.

Great line from a great matrix game.
@_date: 2019-08-03 21:05:46
Would love to buy some aswell
@_date: 2019-08-08 21:20:33
I didnt do the math. But ongoing to say yes.

I cant believe people watch this channel. It is so bad.  The host repeats himself, repeats what others are saying, copies others content and to top it off talks really slow and asks a bunch of dumb questions. "What are you doing? Are you holding? Are you selling? Are you waiting for a dip? Are you dollar cost averaging? Are you new to the space and just trying to get s feel for it? Are you waiting to buy at a better price? Are you not concerned about the price and happy to buy a small amount each week"  Those questions take him a good 2 minutes.
