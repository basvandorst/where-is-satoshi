I have a versa. Basically you get what you pay for. They are known for rattles in the dash and sensitive steering. Anything like wind, uneven tire pressure or a crown in the road will cause it to veer hard.

Maybe? The drop is mostly from a panicked sell off so maybe it will rubberband back to a higher value than it is now. Keep in mind there could be more bad news that could cause more panic.
