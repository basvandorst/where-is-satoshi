Indeed - speculative to its core. That much of a speculation that some people are actually converting 100 BTC into 300 "GOX" BTC - and on the other side we have people converting 100 "GOX" BTC - into 35 "REAL" BTC. Crazy! 
2 Possible scenarios:
1. MtGox defaults - we lose every single penny. 
Nothing we can do about it.
2. MtGox returns to "normal" operation, whereas "normal operation" is still hard to define. They might limit BTC Withdrawals to 1 BTC a day for example! However - either way - this would mean some people made 200-500% on their GOXBTC trades.
50/50 chance between scenarios? Nah. I would say the chance is around 25/75 that MtGox would truly default. 
Yet again - the above statement is obviously of a highly speculative nature. Charlie Shem said: "good news [is] on the horizon for people who have funds stuck in MtGox".
In my case - it was very difficult to stop myself from depositing a small amount of USD into MtGox at those rates. It is just too easy to sell 1 Bitcoin through for example OKPay for around 550-600$ - and use that same USD to buy 3-4 "GOX" BTC on MtGox.

LOL? Fiat a store of value? What a joke! Fiat having intrinsic value? An even bigger joke!

Utter Nonsense haha. 99.999% - you are saying that "these guys" own over 12.47 million BTC while "the rest" only owns ~1250 BTC? Cmon, exxagerating is one thing - but this ?
