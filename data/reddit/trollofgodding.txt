Hey, your imaginary money won´t help people eat, asshole.
Try donating real money, fucking cynical hypocrite.

Actually, the best thing to get shitcoin accepted is to create REAL startups that accept them. Of course, that would represent hard work, time, dedication, a lot of studying. 
And that is something buttcoiners like you (that is, all of them) don´t want to do.
@_date: 2014-11-02 15:44:08
Actually, people like you deserve to be poor and live on the streets without receiving any aid from the State.
If you spent your money in ASCII characters in a deregulated market, there is no reason with the Federal Government should cover your losses. If you want to be libertarian, be a libertarian all the way.-

Aaaaaaaaaaw but credit card systems are BAD BAD BAD!!!!
Now they are good?
Fucking brainwashed hypocrites.
@_date: 2014-11-04 17:35:29
Because you guys make people laugh :)

Have you considered selling your WoW currency and buying yourself a life?
@_date: 2014-11-11 18:38:42
You are basically going to shit all over good people doing good deeds to promote your idiotic WoW currency.
Why don´t you donate REAL money on behalf the Shitcoin Foundation? It would be less unethical.
Bunch of psychopathic sick fucks.

Rest my case, your honor.-
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:30:05
C´mon guys... don´t overestimate yourselves.
Truth is that a bunch of teenagers trading WoW currencies in a website named Magic The Gathering: Online Exchange is waaaaaaay an invitation to have people laughing at you.
And to make it even worse, you bought WoW currency for 1100 USD per unit. XD
@_date: 2014-11-02 15:41:08
I am actually laughing my ass off at wannabe-rich-without-working suckers and freaks who believe this is a revolution XD
Oh, yeah... keep buying, so that your losses go up to heaven.

Shitcoin troll here.
Actually, we hang around because we have fun seeing you rant as shitcoin price drops like a rock in the ocean and you say that it is the FED, the chinese, NWO and Justin Bieber.
Do you wanna know why you are a magnet to r/Buttcoin?
Because of things like this:
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:43:07
If you do that in the Real Market you end up in jail; get a life, moron.

Makes sense, someone is going to give paper wallets the role they deserve.
@_date: 2014-11-02 15:41:42
... and there is also no money in your wallet :)

And then you woke up and realized it was a LSD dream.
