You live in a fantasy world if you think killing 0-conf would not destroy much of the current ecosystem. Today, for example, I made an ATM withdrawal with 0-conf. Also, I made a bitpay payment, also using 0-conf.
These are the real-world applications fulfilling the vision outlined in Satoshi's white-paper. Your ivory tower reasoning that 0-conf were "never" "meant to" be safe shows you need to get out there and start actually using bitcoin the way it is being used on a daily basis. 
As for the price drop, I agree with you though, it's probably got nothing to do with these issues, and even if they have, gotta live with it, and if someone can't, stay away from bitcoin. Price will be volatile for many more years.

Agree completely. Tech is a major player on the same level as banks, and with opposing interests. So far none of the big tech players have taken bitcoin under their wings yet. It would probably be good strategy for them, and I'm not sure why they haven't yet. But I think they eventually will. Bottom line however, is that bitcoin is a fly that could be swatted any minute by the fat cats, EXCEPT for the fact that it is too fast moving for the fat cats, AND it also breeds in shit, where the fat cats don't want to stick their well groomed paws.

I don't think it is coinatmradar's fault. The operators have to get their shit together and start cooperating proactively with the outside world. 
IMHO the whole Bitcoin-ATM eco-system is a huge failure. The ATM system doesn't take off because of experiences such as the one you describe here in the OP, are standard. People go to coin ATMs and get ripped off with absurd fees, the machine is oftentimes not functioning and limits and verification demands seem very arbitrary and opaque. If you're really lucky the operator has bothered to report correct data to coinatmradar, maybe a few montsh ago when it was new and shiny, but typically not. And ultimately this is the undoing of the ATM operators, because people can't rely on the ATM network and simply give up going to them. This leads to machines often closing or moving because they are not profitable, which causes people to waste even more time going to machines that aren't even there, or have raised their fees to something even more ridiculous and so on. 
For fiat ATMs, it's not a big deal if they are sometimes out of order, because there is another one just around the corner, but for Bitcoin ATM where you may have to travel considerable distances to get to one, it's insanely frustrating when it's not working.
IMHO the ATM operators and manufacturers need to properly band together and make sure some site or service like coinatmradar (doesn't have to be them, although it seems the obvious choice) or better yet some API, ALWAYS and AUTOMATICALLY have the correct information. It shouldn't be rocket science when you consider that every machine by definition is online and set up to exchange data. How hard can it be to get the 10 or so major manufacturers to agree on an API to which exact information about the 10 or so most fundamental parameters about installed ATMs to ALWAYS be posted.

Number of transactions undertaken by humanity per unit of time is probably increasing faster than worldwide population growth. I don't have any numbers whatsoever to back this statement up with, so take it for what it is worth, but the amount of monetary transactions per human per day has almost certainly increased alongside industrialization/capitalism. Pre-industrial agrarian society you were mostly self-sufficient and people did monetary transaction only every month or so. In early modern times, or pre-industrial towns, more often, but still far from many many times per day as we do now. The overall trend is ever increasing specialization and increasing division of labor. Simple example: 50 years ago you (if male) would bring a lunch box containing lunch your wife had made to work. If you were the wife, you would go buy groceries once or twice a week and prepare all the family meals using this. Although you may still do some of that, chances are you pay someone for lunch: Lunch has become commoditized, and something that triggers a transaction. As has a lot of other things in your life. Then you top it up with a soda or a bottle of water from a cornershop or vending machine along the way back to your office. This is a lot more transactions that you would  do decades ago.
On top of that, we are at the brink of the internet-of-things revolution. I'd be very suprised if that didn't trigger a cascade and exponential growth of number of financial transactions happening in the world. Micro-transactions and machine-to-machine tx are going to happen. Obviously Bitcoin will never keep up with such a massive growth, although hopefully a 2nd or even 3rd layer on top of bitcoin will.
But my point is, don't underestimate the future growth of worldwide financial transactions, as the currently underdeveloped world industrializes, technology facilitates further division of labor in the already industrialized world - and machine-to-machine and machine-to-man transactions take off on top of that.

*The actual payment network is coming. SW will solve transaction malleability and reduce block size pressure. LN will provide instant and secure payments which are far superior to 0-conf.*
Yes, but until these projects actually exists, and are tried and proven, we NEED 0-conf to not kill the ecosystem.
Burning down the existing payment network just because there will be a better one in the future would be downright retarded. The existing infrastructure need to remain unbroken until the replacement system is ready to outcompete it.

Cash is primarily a payment system, not a settlement system. Hardly anyone does a transaction bank-to-bank, then withdraws the money as cash to deposit in their mattress (the Greeks/Cypriots may have wished they did, but that's due to a temporary situation, not the normal). It's quite common to do it the other way however - you do the transaction cash-to-cash, then deposit the money in the bank. Similarly you withdraw cash from the bank in order to buy dumplings and beer, not the other way around. Clearly cash is primarily a payment system with bank accounts as the settlement layer. It was different a 100 years ago, but not nowadays.

Wow, the naming of this service is going to run into so much legal trouble in Scandinavia, where a huge mobile payment service is already called Swish, and backed by all the large banks of Sweden and Denmark. This Mycelium Swish is basically doing the exact same thing, except with bitcoin insted of the legacy banking system, from what I can figure from the video.
Mycelium guys, call your lawyers and a translator and have them look into

Sweden and Denmark may be a pair of weird little countries up North, but there are some huge banks staking pretty much their entire everything on this payment system (yes, the *other* one called Swish) and it's already taking over much of payments in these countries.

Your examples point towards what is often pointed out elsewhere, and actually undermine your point: Technological progress (and adoption) is accelerating - possibly exponentially. Printing, the 15th century invention, took hundreds of years for mass adoption. The 19th century invention of electricity took about a century for full adoption. The automobile, the great invention of the early 20th century took on the scale of a couple of decades. Continuing further, home computer penetration took on the scale of perhaps 20 years. The Internet roughly took a decade after the web browser was introduced. The smartphone less than a decade. Granted my examples are arbitrary and happily ignoring global aspects (although global penetration seem to also accelerate exponentially), but I think it's an adequate illustration that something has changed, and most likely is still changing.

Nothing per se, but if your opinion is that something should become something completely different from what it was initially intended as, it raises the bar for the burden of proof of what you want to transform the system into. And bitcoin was created primarily as a peer-to-peer payments system, "electronic cash", as outlined in the whitepaper. Sure, you can use it for other things as well, but saying "it shouldn't primarily be electronic cash, or a payment system, it should be [Insert Pet Purpose] instead even if it means making it less good at it's initial purpose" isn't exactly harmless. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 01:03:31
*Right now it's paid for by monetary inflation but that can't last forever. The plan was always for bitcoin to transition into paying for proof of work through transaction fees.*
Who said anything about forever? The plan was always for bitcoin mining to rely on the subsidy for frigging DECADES. Trying to switch to transaction fees before even the 2nd halving has happened yet is ridiculous. Solving the problems that lie SEVERAL DECADES away, at the expense of solving the urgent problem here and now of blocks filling up and mainstream adoption is held back is absurd. You can fix the main problems of the mid-century right now all you want, but if the currency gets stalled or out-competed before we even hit the 2020s, what's the point? Especially if the stalling and out-competing is *caused* by you implementing measures suited for a much later time.
The subsidy is a great mining reward as long as adoption grows, or a reasonable assumption of it's imminent growth makes price per bitcoin high. The brilliance of Satoshi's reward structure is that as long as the currency is in a growth phase, the subsidy reward will be extremely valuable, and only when growth gets saturated will the subsidy reward start fading, but by then thanks to mainstream adoption, transaction fees will be more than enough to compensate.

The schedule for the subsidy halvings being strung out over a century makes it pretty clear that the subsidy is supposed to play a major role for a very very long time. 
 
I agree there should be a transaction fee, as there already is, although obviously symbolicly small, but sacrificing scalability before the currency has even remotely reached any mainstream adoption in favor of artificially replacing subsidy with tx fee after 7 years rather than say 20-30 years or more, is what I am objecting to.  
@_date: 2015-06-03 01:06:42
The market is certain to price in the halving in advance. Is the current price as it is because pricing in has started, or it would be lower? Perhaps. Will the pricing in accelerate half a year before? A month before? Did it start in November 2013? Will there even be a delay and the effct only come after the fact? "Maybe" to all of the aboves. Only thing certain is that it is unlikely to be a sudden doubling of the price on the day of the halving.

*Who are these people cheaping out on fees?*
They are the ones who, by so doing, allow you got get by with just paying ten cents a tx and having zero problems. In fee market of starved tx limits, every successful transaction happens because someone else's transaction failed instead. Your comment seem to indicate that somehow if everyone paid ten cents a tx, everyone's tx would go through without the a problem, which isn't the case.

No, that is not how military power works, that's not how leverage works. You don't  scramble your jets every time you want to use your influence, you don't even need to mention the existance of them, just like you don't have to actually send a SWAT team to someone's door every time a government want someone to obey the law, you don't need to send every journalist to prison every time you want them to write nicely about your regime. A war against a pesky little nation here and there every 10 or so years just as a reminder to the world, and a high profile arrest of a dissident now and then, or the ruthless persecution of a famous whistleblower - that's enough to keep everyone knowing who holds the big stick. 
99.999% of the time, people/countries just obey by default, recognizing the established pecking order. The benefits of obeying the stronger power are great, the costs of disobeying are horrific, therefore you just obey by default, and even more so in minor issues that aren't even threatening your core. This is how every little tiny step of obedience works, no matter if it is about the let's say the Philippines or Finland visavis the United States, or with an individual visavis their government. I can assure you that no country in the world will waste their relations to the United States (or China, for that matter) for something as (still) insignificant as bitcoin, even if they didn't already agree with the measure (which they probably do, if it is threatening to themselves too).
Now, if bitcoin was used on a daily basis by the ordinary man on the street, and a significant part of the economy and transactions was dependent on it, or people had their savings in it, the situation might change, as important individuals or the country itself would suffer from squashing it. But we're nowhere there yet.

He is referring to the scheduled halving in block reward that will happen next summer, not a halving in price (more like the opposite).

People have just generally started to assume there is going to be a September stock market crash this year, because it seems to happen every 7 years or so, usually in September or October. Last time was about 7 years ago... Before that, 8 years earlier... then it gets a little bit fuzzier as there should have been one around 1994 but it was rather a bunch of smaller dips, most of them regional around the world. However, 7 years before that we definitely had the legendary Black Monday of 1987 and the pattern roughly continues backwards for the previous 100 years since the invention of stock markets. And this time, stocks are more inflated than ever so hardly anyone is in doubt there will be one at the very least in the next few years. the betting is on the timing and September 2015 seems to have a lot of supporters, especially around this subreddit. My personal guess is that since they usually happen when the majority does not expect it, fall this year may pass uneventfully, because everyone is expecting it and are currently positioning for it, so instead we will see one massive last massive rally early 2016 as everyone will then stupidly think "NO CRASH! It won't happen! This is a New Economy &lt;tm&gt;!" and then BOOM! You wouldn't catch me touching any stocks between here and after the crash though.

Hordes of Euro cash are going to be useful for at the very least half a decade or so, even under a scenario of incoming fiat collapse and supsequent hyper inflation. In a scenario without fiat collapse, but with cash abolished, it will still be useful for a decade or two in a country like Greece. In a scenario without either collapse or cash ban or hyper inflation, it will be useful for several decades. Either way, a mountain of Euro cash will be vastly better than having them in a bank subject to a Cyprus style haircut followed by draconic capital controls.

BTC impending turn to the upside, at least for a while, has been pretty obvious for quite some time, it was merely a matter of when the bear mood would shift. However, what is interesting is the media spin on this, with several mainstream media effectively saying that bitcoin is a legitimate hedge especially in times of fiat market uncertainty. This is a completely new development an a major shift from the previous creed of "it's a ponzi" or "it's for silly geeks" or "it's for criminals only".

The costs of securing the fiat network is insanely much higher than that of securing te bitcoin network.

The analogy is still  absurd though, unless you claim that most bitcoin investors were forced at gunpoint to start using bitcoin, and now eventually some of them have started showing sympathy for the currency. That's quite far from my understanding of what happened. Pretty sure everyone who jumped onboard did so mostly voluntarily.
Now, if you had made the same allegation for fiat, it would have made a lot more sense, because there at least someone DID force everyone at gunpoint to start using a particular currency.

You are taking an an extremely biased source, the very very left leaning DailyKOS, at face value and uncritically believe their slant on the matter.

The point is control. In the ideal statist world, everything that happens in society is controllable by the authority machinery. Not that they imagine everything being actively controlled, but controllable. If Someone In Charge of Stuff (SICOS) felt the need, they should be able to correct, prevent, reverse or punish everything that happens. But SICOS have no way of doing this with cash transactions, and therefore it drives statists nuts. They will never rest until SICOS has every financial, or financial-like transaction is controllable. Unfortunately for statists, the truth is that cash exist not because of an anachronism, but because of a fundamental human need, which is also a fundamental need of a free market. That need has caused the existence of cash, and trying to remove notes and coins will only feed the birth or resurgence of other similar means of private exchange.

As the article explains well, one huge benefit is that the currently unconnected masses of the poorer corners of the world can now have super cheap smartphones made available. You buy a phone super cheap, because part of it's sparetime resources will be used for bitcoin PoW, and the proceeds from that will be split between the maker of the phone, and the phone itself. The phone will use the satoshis to purchase more airtime, or whatever.
The big benefit is that the third world can get super cheap phones, and the mining operations will happen without the user having to worry about top-ups or any of the under-the-hood bitcoin operations. As a bonus the user probably gets a hardware wallet built in that they CAN use to top up and use on Points of Sale.

It isn't, because the policies of the Chavez/Maduro regime managed to mishandle the wealth of the oil boom years so incredibly badly, and make the country so completely dependent on inflated oil prices that even Russia seems a diversified bastion of prudence in comparison. Basically, Chavistas said during the good years: "So much free oil money! Let's buy cool stuff, like free refrigerators for all and heavily subsidized import booze, and stop working on anything else! Screw the economy, we don't need anything but our oil!". Well, suddenly reality called and now their only resort is repression and fiery speeches trying to blame everyone but themselves for their situation. This country has more oil reserves than ANY other country in the world! And yet, throughout the most spectacular oil boom ever, the Venezuelan economy developed slower than most of their Latin American neighbours who have almost no oil. And now that the oil bonanza is gone, it is of course going straight to garbage. The Chavez/Maduro regime's failure is one of epic proportions. I can only think of Zimbabwe and Mao's 1960-70'ies China as comparable failures.

Ads is a revenue type that favors centralization and constantly pushing towards large conglomerates and corporations. The highly centralised Internet media world of today, with basically Google and Facebook and a few more eating up most of the cake is a natural outcome of an ads centered global business model that turned out to be the model of preference of internet 1.0 and 2.0.

And yet, this kind of scheme is precisely how most smartphone sales are undertaken today. Very few people actually pay up front for their iphones or Samsungs.

Homes, cars, washing machines, laptops and smartphones. People love to spend future money now. This 21 thing is very much the same principle. As for the mining, most people will not realize that the drained battery on their cheap phone is because of mining under the hood, and won't associate the slightly higher utility bill with the fact that they need to charge their phone more often than they would have without smartphone mining.

In practice though, you seem to have missed the point that right now, in the real world, 10 million Greeks can't access their money because they gave those money over to banks and now the banks have been ordered by the government to not give them back. If your last statement was true, that the banks don't need the deposits, then why are banks even closed in Greece right now? The answer is of course that if people were allowed to withdraw all their money, the banks would topple over in a blink. Ergo they do need the deposits after all.

I think it is due to different meaning of the word "cash". I am not sure exactly where the dividing line goes, but there is definitely a difference between the US meaning and a "European" meaning of the word: In the US "cash" refers to actual paper bills and coins as opposed to checks, credit cards and so on. In Europe (even though the continent is far from homogenous, and don't even speak English as a first language for the most part), the word "cash" (often borrowed into local languages unmodified) tend to more generally mean "money", or at least "liquid money". This use is also common in business talk: You can hear people say of a highly liquid company, let's say Apple, has so-and-so much in "cash", meaning easily liquidable assets. Using cash in a more general sense (or for the account balance on your debit card) in let's say Northern Europe where very few people these days even use paper bills anymore also makes sense, where as a in country like the US where paper money is still a significant means of payment, preserving cash's narrower meaning makes more sense.
In the article here, it's a professor in France making the statement. It seems evident from the context that by "cash" he means money easily accessible on checkings/savings accounts, as opposed to money tied up in funds, equities and so on.

Gold developed its function as currency because the idea of "money" (ie gold and silver, until recently) is a vastly superior system over plain barter. More efficient than swapping my bushels of wheat for your beer, then swap the beer for hides, then finally switching the hides for a pitchfork. Sure, you could argue that bullets or beer  would become the currency standard in a future dystopian scenario, but my bet would be that like in the past, it would still be gold and silver that would be the currency standard. Probably exactly BECAUSE it is not good for anything else. Beer and bullets on the other hand, is probably going to be considered a terrible store of value because your alcoholic bro might drink them on a bender, and then fire the bullets in celebration. Gold - everyone knows what it is for: Store of value.

The whole "safe haven" concept in general has always been largely speculation. If there was a world crises, like political or military unrest, gold would go up because "everyone" (ie speculators) agreed that in case of a crisis, this is what is supposed to happen. Not many ordinary folks would go out buying gold bars just because let's say there was increased tension between Israel and Jordan. What happens now, and what is really interesting, is that bitcoin is adhering to the behaviour that gold used to show. Still not many ordinary folks buying the actual goods, but investors seem to start to say agree that in case of crisis, some of their assets should shift a little bit into bitcoin. This is a huge change in mentality and a massive boost for the credibility of bitcoin that seems to have happened recently with no one noticing it until now.

The problem with land registry is that land is as physical as anything gets. And it is immovable. Because of this, it is the ultimate (and primordial) use case for governments: The men with the biggest guns always can and always will be the ones deciding who "owns" it. It is the anti-bitcoin IMHO. Bitcoin is perfect for money, because money is an abstraction. Bitcoin is also perfect for immaterial rights, like copyright and so on. But land, of all things, is as non-abstract as anything gets. Sure, we could agree to have ownership registered on the blockchain, but at the end of the day, the Men With the Biggest Guns will decide who "owns" it. Just look at Crimea. It was pretty clearcut and as indisputable as anything gets that it was part of Ukraine. But then men with bigger guns decided that it was no longer and no one could do anything (except calling in men with even bigger guns), including referring to treaties or whatever indisputable notary there was. Controlling ownership of land is likely to be the last bastion of government control to fall, not the first.

The peace price is an outlier from the other Nobel prices, because it is given out by the Norwegian parliament (so, as absurdly subjective as it gets). The other, regular scientific Nobel prices (chemistry, physics, medicine) are given out by committees in Sweden of scientists and are almost always chosen on solid scientific achievements. The Litterature price is given out by an academy of 18 writers and literary experts.  Finally, the Economy price is not even a real Nobel price as it was not instituted until half a century years after Alfred Nobel died, was not even remotely considered by the founder himself, and is given out by the Swedish Central Bank on it's own initiative "in memory of Alfred Nobel".

And after all the years of brilliance, unfortunately his final act as Emperor is the undoing of the Empire - he gives the scepter of power to his trusted, but corrupt, insanely incompetent and in fact moronic old buddy. Who, of course, goes on to ruin the Empire.
In the saga the Emperor probaby comes back as the Good King and restores order, but that's not going to happen here, so that's where reality takes over. Maybe the new guy can sort out some of the mess though.

If we don't pay our "coffee" (another word for daily expenses, that makes those seem unimportant from a privacy point of view) with bitcoin, what are we supposed to buy our "coffee" (or books) with? Cash is government issued money and as such can and is being abolished by the government. Remains credit cards and other centralized solutions. How can possibly anyone caring about cryptocurrency, privacy and freedom advocate that we should use Visa and MasterCard and similar corporate (and government) controlled centralized payment systems for the vast majority of our privacy critical daily expenses?
In fact, I'd say keeping our daily expenses anonymous is more important for privacy and liberty than keeping the big "$30 dollar payment fee doesn't matter" -sized transfers on the network.
Being able to buy a car on-chain is cool, but not really essential from a privacy point of view. Pretty obvious to people and snoops anyway that I bought it.
It is far more important for freedom of speech that my book and newspapers purchases are not monitored.
It is far more important for privacy and blackmail-protection that my daily coffee buy outside my secret lover's apartment is not easily accessible to prying eyes.
It is far more important that my teenage daughter can buy a pregnancy test anonymously.
I am well aware that there is currently no realistic proposal to get VISA-level tx rate (and beyond) using just primary layer on-chain transactions, some sort of 2nd layering will be needed, but I find Amir's and other small-block advocates disdain for "coffee buys" frustrating, because although they seem genuinely concerned about privacy, surveillance and oppression, they simultanously seem to have completely missed the lessons of the last few decades of ever expanding surveillance, power grabs, manipulation and control.
Small transactions matter too. If bitcoin doesn't want to be the digital cash payment system outlined by Satoshi, then we will need another one.

I'm not sure you understand the article correctly: The haircut talked about for a (fiat) transaction is not due to inflation, but due to the Argentine governments massive attempts to slap fees on int'l transactions in order to keep their currency control afloat. On top of that there is considerable inflation, but the transaction would have been worthwhile even if there had be no inflation in Argentina, or if there had been large inflation in both Argentina and the rest of the world, because of the skipping of fees (and currency control limits). In the latter scenario, massive inflation everywhere, people at both sender and receiver ends would probably stop changing their bitcoin into fiat, making bitcoin not only superior as a money transmitter (as in the NYT article), but also as a money storage (which it currently, sadly, isn't because near zero inflation in the US and slipping BTC price (and BTC inflation)).

Several of the alts bring unique features to the table that bitcoin can't offer. Lots of them compete for the same niche and are more like clones of each other than clones of bitcoin, although they all ultimately descend from Satoshi. Either way there is evolution going on, most species will go extinct, the fittest will survive. Personally I believe there is room for lots and lots of currencies for different purposes, but ultimately even if only bitcoin will be the last man standing in the end, it will have benefited from this competition and most likely integrated the most important features.

"It ensures whatever business you're doing business with is competent and not going to scam you and disappear never to be heard from again."
No, it doesn't ensure competence. You are making a case for the Guild system in place in Europe befofe industrialism broke through. The guild system was also justified because it "ensured" competence. that is - it ensured that there was no innovation because everything had to be done the way things have always been done. This is the only kind of "competence" a license/guild system can ensure.
Secondly, it does not ensure people can't scam you. This was also, incidentially, a justification for the guild system.
In the end, the new technoogies overwhelmed the old artisanal guild-propped up system, and the guild system was abandoned simply becuase it was almost comically obvious that it was completely  the opposite of benefit to consumers when the fruits of indsustrial methods and technologies started gaining momentum.
Licensing, like the guild system of old, purely serves the purpose of protecting established businesses from new business innovation, does so under the pretense of protecting consumers from mailice and incompetence while in fact doing the opposite.
In the end, innovation will always win and the old system crumble, but licensing decisions may delay the arrival of consumer benefits, and it may also force innovation abroad (or at least to other states).

The card stopped working with bitcoins a week ago. You can fund your account all you want with bitcoin, and you will see a healthy account balance but when you attempt to have the Net+ card charged, transactions will be declined because you don't have enough funds. Idiotically you can't even see what your "untainted" balance is, you just have to keep track of that yourself. This change was not effective a week ago, even though the announcement was made, but a couple of days ago the "card declined" started happenbing and customner service confirms this.
Bizarrely this also applies to funds deposited when it was stated clearly that you CAN use bitcoin funds with the Net+ card, as well as withdraw it. No longer.

It's actually how hotel (and other) reservations SHOULD work: You get obligated to pay a certain sum in the future, after you have stayed, assuming you did stay (or last cancellation date pass). Handing credit card details to shady hotels is a terrible solution, even if ingrained in tradition.

" quote from your post that I replied to:"
No, that was not my post. That was Adenverd. I am Cnaeus. Different posters. 
While the OP title mentions "regulation", I interpreted it as specially about the type of regulation that comes in the form of licensing (and the huge cost for innovators of complying with the license, fees etc). That's what I was discussing and that's what you were discussing in the post I responded to.
"So anybody should be allowed to practice medicine, or offer law services, or build a bridge, or process food wholesale for market? You seriously think that's better for society?"
In general, yes. Obviously only Medical Doctors should be allowed to call themselves MD and so on. If you prefer to go to the hedge witch around the corner instead of an MD, this is then your choice. Personally I advise everyone to not go to quacks, and if a quack makes provably fraudulent claims, the courts should deal with that. But in general yes, anyone should be allowed to cure people, assist people legally and sell their homemade cookies without some bureacrat/corruptable official having to say that they may in advance.

This article has quite some comedy value.
First it describes bitcoin as primarily defined by it's borderless and uncontrollable properties.
Then it goes on to describe how it is now about to become more valuable becuase a US financial authority, the CFTC, is about to control it within US borders. 
As if they hadn't just said that it was borderless AND uncontrollable AND it's value being derived primarily from those properties.

Also try out Localbitcoins.com. It's peer-to-peer (you buy from some other dude, not an exchange). No bank account needed and they have a bazillion of different options for how to pay, from face-to-face (for the hardcore) to very convenient ways of depositing at the seller's bank, to Moneygram and so on. The bitcoins will be held in escrow, making it almost impossible to be ripped off if you look for sellers with lot's of trades (easy to see on the site).
Also, if you have any fondness of liberty, you will probably feel a warm fuzzy feeling from doing business directly with other citizens, completely (well almost) bypassing the corrupt bankster system... ;)

I see your point, but I think the Normal Joe phase is 
a) Transitional and
b) Not the only one.
That means, that just like many Normal Joes have gone from considering "maybe stock market funds would be an alternative to just have my money on the bank?", to investing in funds, then stocks and possibly further, many a Normal Joe will wet his toes with bitcoin and later realize that other specialized coins may be a useful alternative
b) Even without reaching the Normal Joe, there's more than enough of Abnormal Jims to create a fertile room for other specialized coins, other niche alts.
And yes, it is incredibly risky investing in alts. But if the entire crypto market scales up 10 or 100 times, then what is today a tiny alt could be as big as bitcoin is today. Still risky, but (like bitcoin today) serving a non-trivial market.

@_date: 2015-11-13 13:40:51
I agree. A Fedcoin would make zero sense, a Chasecoin would be frowned upon by other banks and the Fed(s), and a All-the-banks-together global Bankcoin would drive the world population nuts, not least in the US where anything that smells even remotely of world government is politically impossible. Banks are not going to compete with bitcoin the currency.
However, by making the legacy fiat system faster and perhaps cheaper using bits and pieces of "blockchain tech", they think they have a good chance to increase their profits, and as a side effect keep Bitcoin at bay because faster/cheaper banktransactions lessens one of the competitive advantages Bitcoin has today. Also, it is one of the "Legit" advantages Bitcoin has (not related to shady stuff), so once they have neutralized that advantage, it will be easier to ban/block bitcoin because at that point they can say that all bitcoin has going for it is the shady stuff.
That's how I see their reasoning, and I guess it has some merit, but I don't personally think that is how it will play out. I do believe Bitcoin will "win" in the end because what the banks fail to take into equation, is that innovation and speed of evolution within the "free" space is going to be so much faster. And therefore, while the banks implement their grand masterplan over the next 10 years, the world economy will have changed so drastically their (the banks) win will be the little one, while the free unregulated world will have already conquered the new markets (IoT-transactions, drone- and 3D-printing services, stuff like that). 
This is analogous with when the Internet revolution swept in. The old dinosaurs in, let's say, publishing, media, etc didn't get killed in their own areas (not until much later), but rather they failed to compete in the NEW areas that eventually become much bigger. They kept selling their CDs and they still keep publishing their books. But meanwhile, Google and Facebook are the new giants - areas that didn't exist back 15 years ago.
This will happen again, and the bank system is dedicating themselves to defending the (little) territory of the present, while Bitcoin and others in the permissionless world will conquer the much bigger sectors of the future.

if you price goods in terms of bitcoin, then there is zero volatility, by definition. Remember, all currency rates are relative pairs: If USD/BTC changes, then it means both prices change in relation to each other. Now, obviously, because the beans in your coffee are paid with dollar, and the barrista's salary is paid in dollar, so even if you decide to price a cup of coffee sold to a customer in bitcoin, you have to adjust for swings in the currency rate. But only because dollar is the dominant currency in the pair. There is nothing inherently more "swing prone" in BTC, other than the fact that it is so much smaller and the dollar price is so much more important than the bitcoin price because of it's size. In a closed loop economy where everyone deals with just bitcoin, there is no hourly/daily/weekly price fluctuation at all, just as there is no such fluctuation within a pure-dollar economy.

It doesn't sound weird at all. Bitcoin exists for exactly this reason, that no one should have to ask for permission from banks/government to use their own money, especially not on things that doesn't harm anyone else.
I would recommend localbitcoins.com ,or if you live near a bitcoin ATM.
Localbitcoins has many different ways of buying. 
ATM is super smooth if you live near one, but depending on country and policy of the operator, you may or may not be required to verify ID and/or phone number., so check that before driving a long distance to it. Also, sadly, they often are out-of-order :/
Check if you have one nearby at:

"Use bitcoin the way you want to use it and stop bashing companies who are trying to run a legal business."
Two things:
1. Most people having issues with this are not mainly upset with Coinbase joining this alliance, but with prominent non-business leaders of the community like Gavin. 
2. Another part of the business world is the right to choose whom you do business with, including the right to vote with your feet (or wallet, rather). Pointing out the shady stuff going on in the sector is information that deserves to be out there, so we can make informed decisions about whom to hand our money over to instead of doing business with someone else. 
The "Shut up, this is just business, these companies have every right to be immoral" argument just doesn't hold, as we as consumers have every right to choose NOT to be idiotic consumers who give our money to companies who works against our interest. The right to boycott a business who acts against us behind closed doors, is just as much a part of free capitalism as their right to make shady deals behind closed doors. In fact, our right to stay informed and make spending decisions is *essential* for free capitalism.

You do not need to pump in 1 Billion for the market cap to rise 1 Billion. Far from all 14 million bitcoins are for sale on the exchanges. 
Let's consider a hypothetical currency called Hodlcoin with 1 million coins, and a current price per coin of $100. This particular currency has extremely low liquidity because most everyone is a fanatic hodler. Only three people have put up one coin each on the only exchange there is. They have priced their coins $100, $150 and $200 respectively. Now someone desperately wants more Hodlcoins, and he buys the $100 coin first, then the $150 coin. Price has now increased 50% to $150 and the market cap has gone up by 50 million dollar at the mere investment of $250. If he bought the third coin priced at $200, that would be another increase of 50 million dollar market cap at the cost of $200.
At this point people would probably start filling up the order book with sell orders, but that is beside the point here that market cap delta is not identical to invested money.

The exchange between fiat and bitcoin is essentially the last point , the "border control", at which national governments can do anything about decentralized money (like bitcoin) and is therefore particularly hard hit with KYC/AML and similar restrictions.

Because if a lot of the new users use SPV clients instead of Core, someone will be encouraged to attack the SPV clients/networks? And this in a world when something like 99.5% already use SPV clients?
I am not trying to be sarcastic here, I am seriously trying to understand if that's what you're actually saying?

You don't need to imprison them, just threaten to imprison them and all the corporations that produce 99.999% of the devices in question will bend over and take whatever bum tribute the government demands.

The article is about Adam Draper, who in the article says:
*"When we talk about blockchain, I mean bitcoin," Draper clarifies. "Bitcoin and the blockchain are so interspersed together, the incentive structure of blockchain is bitcoin."*
He also explains that whenever he speaks with them about blockchain, the word is used interchangably with bitcoin. Some bankers may dream of a different blockchain.

Come on... Please *read* what I said. *Read* the article I am responding to and referring to. It is not my claim. Again: The article is about Adam Draper, and his (presumably rather informed) opinion that when he talks "blockchain" with the Wall Street folks, this word is being used essentially synonymously to "Bitcoin". That's the takeaway. I have never talked to leading Wall Street guys about blockchain(s) and I have no personal experiences to share, hence why I find Draper's comments interesting. I am perfectly aware that there are multiple blockchains left and right, altcoin blockchains to mention just a few hundred. We are all aware of the R3 project. I am also 100% certain that Draper knows this. However, for all practical purposes, according to Draper, in his experience with WS, "blockchain" is being used synonymously to "bitcoin's blockchain", thus "Bitcoin". 
If you have other experiences of your discussions with leading Wall Street folks, or otherwise want to cast doubts over Draper's claims, by all means, please share these with us.

Sadly I think the name of it is partly to blame. Using "coin" in the name implies all sorts of things that are far from true, including the "coins" being indivisible. The whole point of a coin (traditionally) *is*  that it is indivisible. If you chip off a part of a coin, both parts become useless (unless it is pure silver/gold, which they haven't been in a long time).
Something like "bitgold" would have been more adequate, but of course that word was already taken...

In other words - you are part of the problem (no offense, fully understandable you go for convenience, but fact remains that using cards/swish instead of cash is why bitcoin has no chance against the bankster corrupted system in Scandinavia, at least not until the rest of the world have already moved to btc).

It wasn't really a joke, so much as an attempt to claim ignorance in a situation where it was convenient to claim ignorance. "Oh look, I'm just this nice old grandma, I wouldn't know anything about computers" supposedly making her relatable AND getting her off the hook. But now, all of a sudden, she pretends to know how we are all supposed to handle our IT security - *now* it is convenient to not be the little grandma who knows nothing about computers. That's where the hypocrisy lies.

As always, Andreas keeps the intellectual clarity miles above what most others do, and then proceeds to illuminate the essence of that matter in a simple sentence. I hate that I end up sounding like a fawning fanboi every time Andreas says something clever, but his intellectual and moral stringency, and persistent use if it, is in a league of it's own.

"I think the definition of Bitcoin is changing in the process"
I think what she means is: "I'm just as clueless as my colleagues, but slowly we're learning more and more and the horribly wrong understanding we've been going on air flouting, is slowly giving way to a less horribly wrong understanding. We still don't know what we're talking about, but we look confident on air.".

This is probably true for many newcomers, and an annoying obstacle to adoption. People think because Bitcoin is all about "coins" and everyone knows a coin in common language is not arbitrarily divisible, so someone needs to educate new people that the "coin" metaphor  is misleading. A coin is the smaller unit of money. A bill is typically the bigger unit of money. A bill is divisible into coins, but there is nothing smaller than a coin (except another coin, but the smallest unit is always a coin).
It doesn't help that every flipping news article is illustrated with a physical "bitcoin".

There is a fairly high probability that we're simply seeing a classic pump &amp; dump. Cf. the Litecoin pump&amp; dump in July. Heck, it may well be the same folks, having used the LTC as a successful dress rehearsal for the big one.

It's a legacy of the failed Soviet "War on market capitalism" policy that only created a massive black market for pretty much everything, with pretty much everyone participating. A not uncommon consequence of such "wars": Teaches and forces the people to learn how to work around idiotic and corrupt laws and law enforcement.

And like the RIAA, the banks are likely, as their battle increasingly appear to be lost, to resort to the same tactic as then of using political pressure on the politicians they have already pocketed, to get their profits politically enforced when they fail to compete fairly on the market.

iOS8 is long ago, we're at iOS9 now. And yes, Apple's upgrade ratio is crazy high - withing 24 hours of iOS9 being released, 12% of the users had already upgraded. I'd wager it's far more than 50% with even less than 10% for pre-8. 
Mostly becuase the upgrades are typically very hasslefree, and it's more hassle to not upgrade.

Yeah Huobi has been leading this whole charge. If the theory that the Chinese are trying to move their money abroad is correct, then this is what you would expect, I suppose (buying CNY/BTC at Huobi, selling off at Bitstamp and other Western exchanges).

Bitcoin's price is always changing in relation to fiat currency.
Another way to look at it, fiat currency price are always changing in relation to bitcoin... Currently fiat is the sun and bitcoin is a tiny planetoid, with less mass, which means it swings more wildly, but technically they both orbit each other, so it makes more sense to think of it as "bitcoin price is changing". If one day bitcoin has a bigger mass relative certain fiat currencies, then you will see it as bitcoin price being stable and fiat price always fluctuating... ;)

Yes, as cash is banned, replacements will organically take it's place. Inevitably. In fact, I think we all have a fairly good idea of exactly what that replacement will be, or look like. Some would probably argue it has already started (the banning as well as the replacement).
You can ban a product and imprison a man, but you cannot ban a need, or a demand. You can play whack-a-mole with products satisfying that need and demand, but you cannot eliminate the need itself, and in the long run, the banners will always lose. 
There is a need and a demand for cash (or an equivalent of). Always has been, always will be. Go ahead Men of Power, play your silly game of whack-a-mole if you like. Meanwhile, while you spend your time and energy on this futile effort instead of what really would make a positive difference in the world, reality will pass you by, and your powers will vane, because power belongs, ultimately, to those willing to use it well.

Joking aside, the serious answer is: No one knows.
There are a ton of people who will *claim* they know, but clearly there is no consensus.
Some of the explanations, just off the top of my head: 
* China is fearing currency controls
* China just "legalized" bitcoin
* Russia is about to ban bitcoin
* EU just saw a union-wide clarification that btc should be VAT free
* TA traders will say that the ~~stars have aligned~~ charts indicate it is time for the rise
* "Someone" *knows* "something"
* "Someone" has a hidden agenda for something and/or is pulling the strings
* Dollar is about to crash, btc is used as hedge
* CNY is about to crash. CNY is about to go up. etc.

*Society has designated the rules and you can follow them or leave*
That is not how the world works. Have you not been keeping up with the news since the 19th century? People aren't allowed to just settle down where ever they desire anymore. Those folks from Syria would love to just pick another country, heck no country at all if need be, but the default rule of the global system is that you are NOT allowed to switch country from the one you were born in. There may be circumstances where you can claim refugee status, and if you're lucky in the quota lottery there may be an exception for you, or some other exceptions to this rule if you are persecuted and persecuted by a specific country, but in general, every square foot on this planet is claimed by some grouping of people who will not accept anyone else who wasn't born there to just come and live there. Hence, the "the rules and you can follow them or leave" is simply not true, because the global system does not, per default, allow you to leave.
