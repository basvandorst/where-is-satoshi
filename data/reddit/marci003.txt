Why did you buy?
@_date: 2015-06-22 05:29:43
So how do you feel abot paying 0.001 BTC fee if it's equal to $10? You're paying more in USD terms = fees are higher. Therefore, the price is irrelevant. We need more transactions per block to keep individual fees lower (that means, if the price is higher in the future, fees, in BTC, should be lower, not stay the same).

@_date: 2014-06-29 05:31:35
It would be nice to have some notification/dialog in Bitcoin clients when your transaction (block) was processed by p2pool node: "Your transaction was processed by P2Pool node. P2Pool nodes help secure Bitcoin network by preventing power centralization. Do you want to make a 1000 bits donation to this node?". With some checkbox for 'always'?
Maybe bit dorky. But something like that.

Everything about this device and trezor online wallet is great except one thing - display is quite small so some elderly people / people with eyesight problems may find it hard to read information that is displayed like addresses and mnemonic words.

I'm. I've sold most of my Bitcoin ± year ago. And these type of ad hominem attacks are one of the reasons I'm no longer invested and involved with this community.
I've invested in Bitcoin after first Mt.Gox bubble because it had a promise of being truly p2p cash. Maybe you can find something I've upvoted/commented in since earlier days if you like digging through someones history that much. 
It just saddens me that after about 3 years of knowing about scalability problems, the community is more and more divided. I just can't see how Bitcoin will work this out.

All sane people acknowledge that DAO had a flaw and didn't work as expected. Just because program runs as it was written, doesn't mean that everything is "feature, not a bug". It was moral and pragmatical side that won the argument to reclaim stolen funds. ETC, which only has ~10% of value of current ETH network, quite literally proves, this was what majority agreed on.
Stop bringing this over and over again. Bitcoin had major issues, too, but nobody keeps pointing them over and over again.
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:27:01
even without dapps you already have more decentralized network with faster and way cheaper transactions than bitcoin and with actual scaling roadmap

I think as long as you live in Europe, you should just use Bitstamp. Quick account creation, no verification, free SEPA deposit (~2 days), cheap SEPA withdrawal, &lt; 0.5% exchange fees, good price, no lags..
I was wondering why is it not so popular in US, but than I saw they have $15+ fees for deposit from international bank. Shame, I find it quite dangerous for the market to have so few good exchanges.

We still can have satoshi 'cents' if needed. But I highly doubt we will see a day when even satoshi 'cents' will not be enough. I don't think that Bitcoin will just replace all the other currencies and there won't be any other (better) cryptocurrency in the future. But even if that day ever comes, we'll just have this similar reddit discussion in 10 years. :) I can live with that.

The fallacy here is that you still think we have to choose our unit so it plays nicely with BTC unit. If there is no BTC, there are no SI problems. You just have satoshi. No more 10,000,000 satoshi = 1BTC. Just forget about BTC completely. 
At one point (if value of Bitcoin keeps rising) there will be no one to ever use 1 or more BTC. Therefore, what's the point of having BTC or any BTC derived unit complying to SI rules at all? We can have just satoshi (XST? sat?).
Also.. microbits? seriously? :)

If you have to carry another thing in your pocket and you already carry a cell phone, isn't it just easier to use your phone to scan QR code and send the money?
And you certainly don't have to trust anyone, you have full control of your bitcoins all the time.
And if you're concerned about user-friendliness (maybe for some old people not having smart phone), I'm sure hardware wallets in the future will take care of this.

@_date: 2013-11-21 09:20:12


Yes, Bitcoin (BTC) may be intuitive, but uBTC is not. You still have to explain to a lot of people that there is BTC and uBTC = 0.000001 BTC. And if you change the name for example to Mikes, it's even less intuitive, isn't it?


So you think that satoshi will always refer to smallest denomination possible? I think if we ever need to add smaller denomination we will use other name for them instead of satoshi. I don't know.
edit: I understand your point of view. I'm just not sure if the argument for 'intuitiveness' is correct. Basically because you need to explain to people: We don't use BTC, we use uBTC that is 0.000001 BTC and we call them Mikes. On the other hand with satoshis: There are no bitcoins, Bitcoin is the name of the money, we use satoshis.

I know what he's proposing. And I agree about it. And I don't think it would be a problem. It would certainly be less of problem to have Bitcoin as currency name and Satoshi as a unit than to explain everytime you can buy only 0.00001 BTC if you want (or less!). 
There is chinese renminbi, but the currency unit is Yuan.
We don't need any BTC or Bitcoins, only Satoshis. Therefore no more conversions, therefore no more SI problems you mentioned.

Actually, mBTC stands for millibitcoin, therefore 1 mBTC = 0.001 BTC, not microbitcoin, that would be 0.000001 BTC.
See 
Also, can you provide reference to 'when and where' community decided to use mBTC as the standard unit? Anyway, I agree that bitcents are just way too 'big', millibitcoins seems fine for at least few years.

@_date: 2013-11-21 10:00:28
Basically. But I'm not that stubborn. ;) I just wanted to make sure you understand proposal. 
What I like about satoshis is that it's already established currency unit name that at least some fraction of people have heard of. I just don't really like referring to base unit of currency as micro-something. If it's base, why the prefix? You can call them 'Mikes' or something entirely different but I assume you'd still write them as uBTC or uB. Therefore they are still 'microbitcoins' formally.
So it's not really about 'where to put decimal point', it's about using something that is not a 'fraction' of something else.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:24:03
The recent sellout just showed how little people really studied / looked into other aspects of Bitcoin other than 'potential to price grow'.
