There is a gear icon on the home page of copay. Click it and click advanced in the menu that comes up purge transaction on device a and b and redo transaction.

Sorry about my post we just upgraded to post 1.0 ourselves and I hadn't noticed the lack of purge proposals. Now the creator of a proposal has the ability to remove it I believe. We use 2 of 2 so I am not sure but take a look

Yes I am just a little frustrated due to the $2k electric bill that is now wasted. And not due to just being orphaned. These things happen. But bitsolo's negligence has now cost me money. Because I am the one that solves the v2 block to realize they are on the wrong chain.

Pulled my private server down for maintenance and some tweaks. Fell back to bitsolo as did not want to solve a block for a pool during downtime :( Have a very strange setup so full node on location is impossible due to data caps. So I run stratum proxies to an off site server.

Any update on this? I believe that was my block...

I do not know how they can expect to survive making mistakes like that. I am the second largest at their pool. They are correcting the issue now but they should not fix problems at the expense of users.
