Seems like a bad comparison of scenarios, but I will play along. OK, I give you X amount of dollars, lets say 100$ for your email address and password to online bank account. You sell me those. Is that really illegal?
EDIT: I never have to access your bank account the same way I dont have to do anything with my lucky numbers which may or may not be BTC private addresses.  Again, can't see anything illegal here

How am I hiding it? If a police officer walks up to us during transaction. Seller says my "intent" is to sell him lucky numbers and letters on this paper. I say my "intent" is to buy these lucky numbers, nothing more nothing less. Can't see anything wrong with it. Now that this thread has proved nobody can say it is illegal by any means, I plan to buy as many lucky numbers as I can.  EDIT: joking about "thread" proving anything obv

You are asking if I believe it would hold up. I am asking what laws are being broken? Also for arguments sake, lets play the scenario where both seller and buyer agree to a judge, the police, or the world, that only lucky numbers are being sold and their is no guarantee of anything from those numbers.  What law is being broken by selling lucky numbers again?  I would assume the street vendor can have a vendors license and also pay tax on the $200 profit he made and if my lucky numbers happened to be a BTC private key and I sold those bitcoin for profit I would claim capital gains and pay all required taxes.   So again.....what laws are being broken by selling lucky numbers or lucky words (that may happen to be a brain wallet)?

Am I missing something or are there some details here? Like others have asked, How could Coinbase ever know what you are doing with your coin unless you are a complete noob?

I agree with OP. SWC has brought many people I know into the Bitcoin community and since Black Friday in poker many players need options and don't have the time or willpower to drive to a casino to play live but still would like to play online.

No, nothing about scams or criminals. Simple scenario. I see a vendor on street selling lucky numbers for 100$ I pay him $100 he gives me paper with numbers and letters. What is criminal or a scam about that? He didn't false advertise.

"He will do what is best to please many parties" ?  Don't tell me you actually believe that. I agree its the "certainty and non jail-ness that big money needs" I don't think it takes a rocket scientist to conclude the only people he cares about are the people who wrote the regulations in the first place. ( banking cartel obv)
 EDIT: LOL at "any laws are good for bitcoin"  Really dude? Can't take you seriously.  What if in your state or country they make it punishable by jail or death to download a copy of the blockchain.  Cool right? Because any law is good for bitcoin LOL Can't take you seriously sorry

Isn't the buyer taking a chance buying random numbers and letters sight unseen for a price, also no refunds. Can't see how this could be illegal or make the seller a money transmitter just wanted some clarification.

Just play Heads Up? No collusion there sir

I've always been loyal to Seals with Clubs poker rooom because they have been in business for years and cashouts have always been very prompt, has anyone played on Betcoin Poker? cant seem to find many reviews

So by your logic, even though nobody mentioned BTC and I just bought some lucky numbers for a price, and one day the numbers didn'tt happen to be a BTC private address with funds in them but just regular lucky numbers. Since the UK law isn't so niave, would I be able to sue because the numbers and letters didnt have BTC in them?  Even though bitcoin was never mentioned just lucky numbers for a price. just curious

I know a small auto upholstery shop in Columbus named Mac's Auto Top's &amp; Upholstery that has accepted coin and doesn't use a payment processor for what its worth if you ever need a new convertible top installed or something of that nature.

So if selling lucky numbers that may or may not be bitcoin private keys makes someone a money transmitter or qualifies as money transmission as you say, even though no intent can be proved if both say they are simply buying and selling lucky numbers.  By your logic then selling a picture that may or may not be a wallet seed that gives btc private keys also makes someone a money transmitter? Also selling someone a book that some passages may or may not be brain wallets, etc. qualifies as money transmission depending on where the buyer and/or seller are located. Interesting

You have the right to remain silent.  The court having to prove something is different from a person " lying" to a court.  
@_date: 2014-09-01 22:44:19
Lucky numbers. Not "random".  And what would the charge be for getting into a court of law?  Being a money transmitter w/o license?  Seems like by this thread the arguments for that are weak at best.

There seems to be at least a few people wearing the SWC hats, shirts, and patches at the WorldSeriesOfPoker this year, maybe that will get people asking questions about Bitcoin in general and Bitcoin poker.
