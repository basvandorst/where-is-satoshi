So when they ask for the 12 words I enter the first 12 and ignore the last word? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:08:29
All wallets I've seen ask for 12 and no passphrase. Which wallet can I restore it on that asks for a passphrase?

I checked the blockchain and it only sent a small amount. My balance hasn't changed on Mycelium

Within Tether theirs a USD tether address you send the Bitcoin to. From my understanding you send Bitcoin directly to the Tether wallet 
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:29:02
Now it sent after one of the tiny transactions got 3 confirmations 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:13:14
Do you think at that point the price of BTC will recover? 
@_date: 2017-04-11 05:52:33
Thank you. Do they make you deposit the money into your bank account or can you just keep the money in your wallet or send to another wallet?

It doesn't support digital downloads

Show me a calculator on Google that calculates the hashing rates because I have searched and found nothing that will work

I clicked on the get stared button and it just goes to my account dashboard. Theirs no documentation once I'm logged in for this service

They're obviously using a much lower rate than the market rate for their advantage. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 04:52:35
Not sure why my rate is much higher, I'm 100% not lying   
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:53:09
That doesn't apply to Bitcoin deposits 
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:22:25
I doubt theirs a difference in 600 dollars, their rate is nowhere near anyone's rates. I have a e-commerce site and what I charge is never off more than a $1 or 2 dollars... 
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:08:44
Which ones? 
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:48:32
I went to trollbox the told me to wait 24 hours. I told them it was more than 24 hours, they ignored all messages after that. A lot of people in trollbox complaining about the same thing

Some of the recent comments on there plugin are saying they are stilling Bitcoins etc. Kind of makes me nervous to use them. Reviews           
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:17:24
So when you set up with plugin you just put your Electrums public key? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:07:49
I understand what your saying, there where 3 reviews with the same issue. One sounded genuine he was trying to troubleshoot why his payments where being sent to the wrong Bitcoin address. He was trying to come up with a possible solution to the problem but the developer ignored his comment. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 01:04:44
Thank you for your reply but I know nothing about how to do this. Too bad theirs no ready to go scripts or apps that already do this?     
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:57:02
I just had a customer pay, it told her she underpaid on the first payment, she sent more then she paid the full amount. After she paid the full amount which shows on the Blockchain it still says underpaid on Mycelium Gear orders page! Mycellium Gear support almost never responds and I never got paid because it says the invoice was underpaid. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:33:10
So how likely that this will this bill pass?  
@_date: 2017-06-25 03:18:17
Wow awesome thank you! Where do I input my BTC address? Also do I just copy and paste the code onto my site?   
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:27:55
I saw this web site but the reviews are not that great  
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:39:43
You can sell digital downloads with Coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-06-25 16:32:50
I used Mycelium gear on a project and I had nothing but problems with them 
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:07:24
What are you using right now? Do you know what happens to the underpaid orders that where paid in full? Do we not get the money? 
@_date: 2017-06-22 23:35:27
Was it a withdrawal issue like mine or something else? 
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:39:06
So essentially they will be making digital currency illegal with this bill? Sorry I'm a little confused by the bill
