Plot twist: the government deliberately prints bills with duplicate serials, and this is how the public finds out.

I haven't read it yet but this might be the place to start, by the man himself:

What have we said about cherry-picking data? It's up infinity percent since launch.

Since the price is so strongly correlated against people saying "to the moon!" I suggest we say "to the moo!" instead.  The Fates won't know and more importantly won't care what we're mooing about.

Don't underestimate the allure of the discount. Pass on some of the savings from not paying the credit card company, and you're sure to see an uptick in Bitcoin payers.

Tell him to research 1031 exchanges before he sells. He may be able to avoid paying capital gains tax.

Agreed. Bitcoin needs strong marketing to complement the tech. That should be one of the primary functions of the Bitcoin Foundation.

It's clearly on its way down. I'd short it.

Well put, I've been looking at coins for too long. Grams are the new ounce! Get them while you can people! It wont be long before gold dust is the same price.

Nice aesthetics. Can you make a version based on the template at bitcoinpaperwallet.com?

I second this recommendation. The payout schedule may not be what you're used to but it does pay the same as any other centralized pool. And p2pool may be the best way to mitigate the 51% problem, it just needs more hashrate.

The price is moving against me! What to do? What to do? I'm going to get rekt!

You nailed it. Governments are quietly stockpiling gold in preparation for the massive devaluation of currencies that the bailouts and QE will inevitably bring. But the average citizen that might want to buy say $30 dollars worth of gold per pay period simply cannot, it's not realistic to accumulate it in small quantities. People will flock to Bitcoin because they can. It is a better gold than gold.

Nice idea, and I was sold until I noticed the uptrend began 4 years before the ETF was introduced. The ETF may have accelerated the price increase, but overall the economy picked up quite a bit between 2004 and 2008 too. Gold was a hedge for those that saw a bubble forming, so it's natural that its price would increase throughout that period.
That said, I do think the BIT and Winklevoss ETFs will bring a lot of traditional investment money to Bitcoin, and that's a very good thing. CCMF

Avalanche diodes are a good source of entropy and easy to construct. A number of inexpensive USB and PCI random generators have popped up recently. The kickstarter of a fully open-source/open-hardware model ended not long ago.

Your point actually supports the metaphor. That agreement will undoubtedly be replaced by property laws shortly after land on the moon acquires sufficient value.

If that were likely it would have already happened with one of the alts. Any features popular enough to threaten Bitcoin's dominance will simply be added to Bitcoin.

A smart person would hedge that doubt by buying 1 Bitcoin, storing it on a paper wallet and stashing it in a sock drawer.

This is premature...

I almost went down that road too, but stopped before I lost much money. Cloud mining is a scam...if it's more profitable for the companies to sell hashrate to suckers who will buy it than to mine with it, then you are guaranteed to lose money. And as others have pointed out mining yourself is not a good idea unless you have very cheap electricity. I'm not convinced the equipment even pays for itself unless you can buy the equipment at discounted bulk rates. Just buy BTC and hold it.

I believe Bitwage will provide you with the cost basis. That's half the picture of course, figuring out where each satoshi went and its value when sold/spent is a whole 'nother thing.

Check your frame of reference. The dollar has dropped 5% against gold since mid-March.

It's figurative, not meant as a literal comparison of size. It means Bitcoin's impact on humanity will be larger than the Internet's impact. And while that may sound like hyperbole, it is not to the people saying it.

If you use Coinbase, you can export a tax report that calculates the gains and losses for you. I used that as a model for my other wallets and used historical price data from bitcoincharts.com. Someone could make serious money writing software that automates this.

If it's more profitable for them to sell you the hashrate than to mine with it themselves...you do the math.
