Although I dislike the way BCH is marketed from Roger Ver, I think we also need a voice on the Media. Of course not in the way Roger Ver is doing it with BCash but a Antonopoulos/Ver hybrid!

Confession: I just sold 2/3 of my Bitcoins. Its too stressful for me. I know I am going to regret it, but better live and regret it than die of an heart attack! I still have 1 BTC profit and thats not selling even if it drops to 1Dollar! Just cant take the stress guys! Hope you understand!

Good move! I wish I had done so!

How much did he pay in tx fees? If fees are too low, it will take a while. For a fast transaction you need more than 20-30 dollars fee or even more.

LoL, not everyone bought at 100 Dollars a coin though! Some people (thank go not me) bought at 16K or 17K or even 18K!

Who are u kidding? It went from 20K to 15K, dont just count the last 24H. That makes 0 sense. Its going to go up alright, but lets just be realistic for once!

Coinbase just made it easy to dump BCH for USD :)

From where did you sent it? What fees did you choose?
