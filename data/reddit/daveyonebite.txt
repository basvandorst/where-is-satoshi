I could not pay attention to what the guy with the crazy hair was saying. He has the tiniest hands I've ever seen on a adult man it's too distracting. Reminds me of that BK commercial.

You got me bro I work for the big banks and have been tasked with the grassroots operations of spreading negative sentiment on reddit boards. Your medal is in the mail.

I'm glad your special school encourages you to keep that magnificent imagination most of them suppress your kind. Keep up the good work!

So you mistook my sarcasm at saying I work for the 'Big Banks' for me bragging that I work at a big bank? Judging by your attempted insult that's exactly what you did so I want to apologize. 
I support the mentally challenged and their rights. It's awesome that you learned how to use a real computer. Keep up the good work!

If this was the majority consensus then that would be promising people who believe in the product vs those who want to believe because they want profit

I disagree. you can follow the herd (too late) and sell your alts for more BTC or you can see through the frenzy and pick up more Alts.

So perhaps this is where I am missing something or thinking incorrectly. I want to believe!
If 10 years later that X bitcoins I spent is now worth 250x more versus the 2 dollars I could have spent which has been stable minus inflation or even degraded due to the bitcoin success wouldn't that have been a bad decision from a financial gain perspective.
I do think your strategy is the best way for bitcoin Sucess but it needs the masses to follow suit so your left with almost a prisoners delinma of knowing the right thing to do but opting for a bitcoin savings and a cash checking because you don't trust the bitcoin checking/savings will be adopted.

Yeah it's looking like I'll have to. I was hoping to avoid it in case I get the answer I don't want and have to sell.
I'm hoping I won't b/c usually they need this info to look out for day trading, insider trading, client contacting, tax evasion none of which im doing.
