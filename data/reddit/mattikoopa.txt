Couldn't get it to read on mine at all...
It's too noisy.

Domains or even Servers can be easily blocked. The blockchain can't even be reverted and has no fixed source.

No bank fees. But yeah it takes a work day to pass through.

That would annoy the shit out of anyone. Usually Notepad++ opens in &lt; 1 second with your document(s) loaded. No one wants to sit through a splash screen or even click a dialog.

Maybe it's not free for businesses?I'm in Austria. I'm pretty sure they got rid of transaction fees at least 5 years ago.

Make it the blinking text when maggie is scanned at the checkout.

This is obviously some guy trying to make a quick buck out of stupid users. I doubt the hackers even have anything to do with that.
@_date: 2014-02-12 14:41:27
It sure is. Here in Austria it's moderated by the same guy for over 10 years.
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:57:06
Those are probably conversation rates. € &gt; € transactions are free.

Do you make a new account for each item you buy on ebay? Do you use PO boxes as shipping address?
@_date: 2014-05-16 08:35:50
That *might* open doors to possible future real security threats.
@_date: 2014-05-16 08:32:15
The blockchain is open and can not easily be blocked or reverted. It might be way better then usual methods.

Mt. Gox claimed they found the 200000 Bitcoins in an old, forgotten wallet.

The store is out-of-business...

It's not a valid QR code. It misuses a behavior of some (popular) readers to be accepted but most readers rightfully won't scan it.
@_date: 2014-08-08 09:43:25
But why did she send a check and did not just do a normal transaction?

As someone outside of US, why it it illegal to send money to Iran?
@_date: 2014-04-17 14:37:50
Ah yes that worked

This is some next-gen grammar nazi shit.

You need flash and a computer, sadly.

I was not aware that phone numbers can be spoofed. I have never seen this or even heard about it. Does this only work in Australia?

That website worked for me for about 2 weeks. After that I was back in my can't sleep schedule.I need a version 2.0.

You can have basically everything you want after the domain name and the first /.A directory is only a common example.

This is the 21. century and young Japanese people are not dumb.

I would like to hear it. What was the reason?

Voted and tweeted. 😉

But then you usually get told what to fix before resubmitting it.

Some of you guys just forcefully deny this story. Those denials are even bigger conspiracy theories then the article would be.

They selected one with [Leberkäse]( a few years ago. McDonald's partners up with Radatz to make one.
That competition is kinda meant for weird and exotic burgers.

This is true. Views (displayed in the counter) are different then "ad views" which only count if you watched over 60% or something of the video without adblock.

PHP is kinda old and not very efficient and modern. The secure is a secondary problem imo.
@_date: 2017-03-14 08:21:59
Why do you think that? Afaik there are no issues currently and BU clients aim for 2-8 MB blocks. Which isn't that much for now and will probably last quite a while.
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:25:27
I am behind lighting networks. I am also behind BU though as I think artificially limiting block size is not the way to go.
And the real problem is now to solve the block size issue. And not just patch it for a couple more months. When SegWit goes live, it will not magically make huge lighting networks appear and solve all transaction problems instantly.
My main point here is that the individual network speed does not matter. Bitcoin is a global network and thus the usual problems of Globalization apply, which means that to stay competitive you have to invest something or go somewhere else.
Will this cause more centralization of full nodes? Yes it will. But what's the alternative? Cripple the whole world instead?
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:11:27
The average network speed worldwide does go up (and that happens very fast recently).
You can't cripple the whole network just to let everyone with slow speed in. If your area want to host full nodes, they will have to invest in network upgrades. It's exactly the same as with the CPU power: When the average goes up, you have to upgrade or be left behind. That's how the system works.
You have to run your full node somewhere else if you want to keep up (which also isn't a problem using the cloud and from what I gather even way cheaper then running from your home).
@_date: 2017-03-14 08:37:36
Even with 8 MB blocks there is no way it will be that much.
@_date: 2017-03-14 08:56:53
Okay I get your point - but do you really need to run a full node in rural Australia then?
I mean I get that you want decentralization and that's okay - but the environment has to be up there. The original theory was that everyone with a CPU could mine Bitcoin. In reality though only people with special hardware can nowadays. The average CPU power goes up so small people can no longer mine. The same thing will happen to network power.
When the average speed goes up, people who cannot adapt will be left behind. But that's just how the system works. It's a scaling problem.
It's designed this way. Network speed and CPU power improvements are investments. So in order to control Bitcoin, you have to invest something.
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:14:54
Which will get better and better over time. There are already widespread fiber power connections in many countries.
@_date: 2017-03-14 08:30:59
But mobile networks also gain speed and availability. 5G is already on its way in some countries and 4G is now very widespread. So even in rural areas the speed will go up.
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:35:21
But this is just a scaling problem. Just as the CPU power goes up and gets cheaper (something Bitcoin is designed around) will happen to networks. They will get faster and more dense.
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:01:05
So I don't get your internet speed problem then in an urban area. Just upgrade your connection.
And to verify your transaction, you don't need to run a full node 24/7.
@_date: 2016-11-08 08:39:40
Might as well...

Actually this is much more interesting for leaks. That private key for the PS3? Try to DCMA the blockchain. Some names of NSA agents? Good luck blacking that out.

Ash is actually just short for Satoshi. They call him "Ash" in Japan as well for a nickname. In the western release they just scrapped the full name alltogether.

Probably some weird behaviour of those programs in the detection code that is exploited here. Definitely not a valid QR code.

Can someone explain to a non-iPhone-user what's going on?

The build-in QR reader on my WP could not scan it. Not even recognize it on the photo (no border drawn around it).
My guess is it's not a valid QR code.
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:05:29
Oh you need a special app? I just tried my normal QR reader and it didn't work.
@_date: 2013-12-14 00:35:36
That's part of the joke.

I can't scan any of them with my phone at all. Except if they look better printed out on a physical paper you would have a hard time scanning them.

How do you buy and sell so fast?

I really hoped the QR code would actually work...

It seems like a eBay-like aproach. Would you recommend it over an organisation?
Edit: Also how should I handle wallets? bitcoin.de seems to have a wallet built-in. Isn't that unsave? Can I use an own wallet? How should I use it?

Thank god for that. There is never any information besides a few blog posts, a description and an image on these pages and everywhere you click you get a "please login to Facebook" message.
