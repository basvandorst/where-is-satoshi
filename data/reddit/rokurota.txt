a simple update? SIMPLE? Because the last 12 months has been SO simple

I'm not asking for yet another bullshit prediction. You have literally only reinforced my question in the first place. 
@_date: 2016-04-07 14:59:00
I mean, true crypto enthusiasts shouldn't let greed make the decisions. We need to think with our heads not our wallets

Why does an altcoin have to backed by Bitcoin? IF Other coin succeeds I don't it's going to have much to do with Bitcoin

So much schadenfreude in this sub

Ethpool has, again by democracy, the right to do whatever it wants with the results of its vote (which they deemed to have been faked)
@_date: 2016-07-22 14:57:40
OP used the word democracy in his title, not me.
@_date: 2016-07-22 15:07:26
What's wrong with a democracy where a vote was offered and only a handful of people bothered to vote? Political elections are the same way. MOST votes are the same way (look at brexit). Sounds like you have a problem with human nature, not the democratic vote process that Ethereum used.
@_date: 2016-07-22 15:06:17
It doesn't matter if it was faked or not. What matters is that Ethpool has the right to do whatever they want. That's democracy. If you don't like that, then maybe you don't like democracy? lol.
@_date: 2016-07-22 17:41:10
It's well within their rights to switch pools or do this or do that or whatever. Everyone's voice was heard, everyone's vote (if they chose to vote) was counted. That is as democratic as it can get.
@_date: 2016-07-29 23:23:59
Yeah but Vitalik and Co doesn't talk shit about Bitcoin the way you guys talk shit about Eth. Vitalik respects Satoshi and Bitcoin. You still don't see the irony?

"Based on this Ethereum development"
Aren't you guys embarrassed to blatantly steal from the product you bash on a daily basis? 
@_date: 2016-07-22 14:21:42
The Ethereum hard fork was democratic. Users, Miners, exchanges, core developers, dapp developers, and even seemingly half the bitcoin community had their say. The debate raged on for a full month. Then we all voted. That's democracy.
@_date: 2016-07-22 17:41:31
Let's not argue semantics here. Clearly I meant that OP brought up the topic of democracy first.

First of all, no real hedge fund would risk it with the current exchange. Secondly, there is no method of shorting available right now (that I am aware of)
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:14:28
Well the current outlook is that they'll hike in a year or so. Who knows what will actually happen. As bond traders, we dont always take directional risk. I cant predict which way bonds will go lol.

Wall street might be filled with morally ambiguous people, but they are not jam packed with mediocrity.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:40:01
I can't really discuss my personal trading here on reddit.
If i were to trade bitcoins though, I wouldnt use a buy and hold strategy. I would be as transactional as possible. Buy 50, sell 70, buy 40, sell 60, buy 50, sell 90, and so forth. However, that's only because i feel the price is going to be rangebound going forward. That applies for short term trading though. For a long term strategy, its really hard to say.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:42:08
Well that's precisely why trading is so difficult. And experienced traders find ways to make money on products that DONT rely on the direction of bitcoins. If you were to use something other than charts, then you could use fundamental analysis. For example, just HOW worthwhile do you think bitcoins reallly are? Do you truly believe they are the wave of the future? Do you believe other people will also arrive at that conclusion? 
If I had to guess, I think the market will start to die down. Those prices up in the 200s that we saw a few days ago, dont count on seeing those any time soon. We have a saying in trading when stuff like that happens. "We will never see those prices again"
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:27:55
Yep. That's what most traders do. They usually dont take take directional views on the market. That game is for fools, generally. Traders tend to find a way to make money around that, without getting caught guessing the wrong direction.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:36:09
I dont trade munis. Even if I did, I dont really care much about the yield. I'm a very short term trader.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:44:34
It might help you understand what has already happened, and you could use that for yourself to form a "view" of the direction of bitcoin (similar to just some basic technical analysis), but in general, that kind of information won't help because all future transactions are random.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:38:24
Always expect the unexpected.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:43:37
That's exactly why there are no professional traders in the bitcoin market right now
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:52:38
Yes. There is a very negative perception of traders in the public eye, mainly because of the financial crisis. Because of this, redditors seem to think that traders have no skill, and that ANYONE can do it. Redditors forget that behind all of the bravado and arrogance, 95% of traders went to top schools, have graduate degrees, and have a competitive spirit etched into their brains from the moment they were born. These people will prey on anyone who is weaker than them. Therefore, it makes it very tough for redditors to successfully trade the market, regardless if its stocks, bonds, or bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:10:15
Well, ONCE a sturdy exchange is set up, THEN you need the market depth to be sufficient enough where no hedge fund will be able to push the price around. Unfortunately, we're not close to being there yet. In my market (fixed income), people regularly push the market around of their own free will, using BILLIONS of dollars in the process. And thats just a lazy friday afternoon for them
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:43:05
That's why trading should be left up to the professionals. Individual investors should defer to the advice of their investment consultants.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:37:48
This is a very important point. What people dont realize is that having a decentralized exchange is very, very bad. There are people out there who dont give a shit about the long-term worthwhileness of bitcoins. If they think they can manipulate the market, they will without hesitation. If they can find a way to leverage their position and drive the price down, forcing people to pre-emptively sell their bitcoins at a loss, they will without hesitation. That COULD be price manipulation in a real exchange, but who's going to stop them on MtGox? No one.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:28:28
That's more than you think, given the market is constantly changing and stuff from years ago has virtually no effect on day to day activity in the markets.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:05:25
When the fed hikes rates, which they will, yields will have to skyrocket. I dont know WHEN they'll do that, but yeah yields will rise. Not sure if we will flatten or steepen, but yields will rise
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:35:42
Technical analysis and charts, in my opinion, are not that valuable for bitcoin. It would take too long for me to explain my views, but I just dont think its very applicable to something so "new" in terms of recent activity. With unpredecented volume and price movement, I dont think charting would be of much help
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:34:28
Well, one thing i can say about the "direction" of bitcoin, I would say that it will probably be rangebound. All the media attention has brought a lot of potential buyers into the market, but it has also brought a lot of people betting against it. I've already heard rumors of a big investment bank trying to construct a paper derivative used to short bitcoin. That would be very bad, as i would guess that large hedge funds would most likely want to bet against bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:32:15
People are buying bonds because the world is fucked up right now. Seriously fucked up.
Dont know much about interest rate swaps because theyre not exchange traded and I just dont have the energy to follow them closely.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:42:14
Believe me, if traders had ANY sort of faith in the exchanges, we would all rush in and slam it down so hard and so fast you wouldnt even know what happened. This isn't necessarily because we think its a bad investment. It's because we can all smell the fear from the current investors, who are quivering in their boots. It would not take much to make this bubble burst all the way back down. One, just ONE, out of the tens of thousands of hedge funds out there could completely cripple bitcoin if they wanted to.
There just simply isn't the proper infrastructure for it.
