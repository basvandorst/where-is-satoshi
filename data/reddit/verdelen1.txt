who owns the keys?

Bitcoin died for your sins.
@_date: 2014-07-26 22:49:26
yes and this is exactly what you will claim about Ethereum when people start wondering where their money went?
**ARE YOU RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ETHEREUM INVESTMENT?**
@_date: 2014-07-26 20:56:20
seems people dont get the difference between a Ponzi scheme and an investment.  A Ponzi scheme has no real underlying business value and works primarily by appreciation and motivating buyers through distribution.  This is MOST altcoins including Matercoin and Ethereum.
@_date: 2014-07-26 23:52:46
It's fairly clear Vitalik, if you believed these Ethers were valuable...
**YOU WOULD OFFER A REFUND.**
Anyone dumb enough to accept your excuse probably deserves to part with their money. All of these pump schemes all have their own forums and 'social media managers' to manipulate public perceptions of their project, yours is no exception.
@_date: 2014-07-26 22:46:59
Mastercoin was a complete scam.
@_date: 2014-07-26 23:27:45
the 'white' and 'yellow' papers are technical mumbo jumbo with no real-world relevance.  You haven't got me dazzled with 'turing complete' and 'shelling point', Vitalik - sorry, even though you write buzzwords 'for free'.
@_date: 2014-07-27 01:04:13
notice he didn't even answer the question!
@_date: 2014-07-26 22:10:47
ah like most situations like this- has partial knowledge and is greedy enough, young enough, and impressionable enough to look the other way.  I dont think he understands what happens when you take this much money from the public.
He's selling the Ethers, that much is clear.  The case does have some new aspects, but mostly it falls under pretty strict SEC guidelines.  I notice they did not seek SEC/CFTC approval in which case the other people in the group might have set Vitalik up as unwitting fall guy.
@_date: 2014-07-26 20:58:28
WHO RECEIVED THE ETHEREUM SALE MONEY?
@_date: 2014-07-26 22:40:27
Vitalik is known for running scams such as Mastercoin.  Public perceptions of him are largely due to claims made in publications which he himself owns/operates.
@_date: 2014-07-27 00:03:09
Hold on here... so is this a fundraiser, or are you selling a product with an intrinsic value?
The fact that you wont give people their money back displays your agenda perfectly.  There is no excuse here.
@_date: 2014-07-26 22:36:51
'investments' like these always require a 'bigger idiot'.
@_date: 2014-07-26 23:11:31
where are the tokens?
you haven't even finished the technology!  you haven't even stated how it's going to work.  thus - THIS IS AN INVESTMENT/FUNDRAISER.
@_date: 2014-07-26 20:52:26
yep that's right- they are just trying to get their marketing money back and probably exit out the back door when no one is looking.
@_date: 2014-07-26 23:22:41
can people get a refund right now if they request it?
@_date: 2014-07-26 20:48:05
"You see an IPO in the NYSE is regulated and protects all parties involved with massive amounts of rules and oversight."
so then you favor the Bitlicense idea, as do I.
@_date: 2014-07-26 19:58:21
I do get the impression that Vitalik is being used by the people running the show.  But how could he be so clueless and do this a SECOND time?  I don't think he's so innocent really- he's like one of the dick tracy criminals named 'baby face' or something.
@_date: 2014-07-26 19:21:21
whats amazing is his last scam still didnt register in the public mind.
@_date: 2014-07-26 21:59:45
yes Im aware of what happened to Erik Vorhees and given the US seems to be clamping down on this sort of thing, wouldn't be surprised if they make an example out of Vitalik, given that he is a repeat offender here.  This scheme could very easily be classed as the marketing of securities.
No doubt they went to Switzerland so that they could run a scam.  Switzerland is a horrible place for a software company, they have extremely weak IP laws and structure there.  IT is a great place to embezzle huge amounts of money.
@_date: 2014-07-26 20:09:02
it is the same scam as Mastercoin, they churned money through a Bitcoin address to make it look like they got enormous investor interest then they made fake bounties to make it look like they were paying out for development.  Vitalik was in on this scam as well.
Vitalik is at the least, criminally negligent here.
@_date: 2014-07-26 20:48:31
VITALIK ARE YOU RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS INVESTMENT?
@_date: 2014-07-26 19:31:28
the legal work was to make sure that no one is liable for the sale of these things.  What people dont understand is these things are not officially investment products thus eg. Vitalik has ZERO obligations to the buyers of Ether.
Does anyone even know where all this money is going to?  I doubt it.  Also note that all the original management people at Ethereum removed their names and pics from the website before the sale.  Im quite sure that Vitalik will be found to have NO OFFICIAL POSITION at ethereum and no legal connection to the sale of these products.
It's very clearly a scam, they overinflated the sales figures and the people who bought into this will get ZILCH.
@_date: 2014-07-27 00:13:22
You are something like an expert bullshit artist apparently.  Why won't you offer people their money back if you think these Ethers are valuable?


Let me guess - 'the community' is whatever your forums are currently saying, that you just so happen to administer?  lol pretty sure this is going to mark the end in the line of these sorts of scams.  Glad you don't have any of my money.
enjoy the champagne.
En Guete!
@_date: 2014-07-26 18:38:28
Vitalik Buterin and Charles Hoskinson were both involved in 2 of those 3 projects.
Vitalik ALREADY PULLED THIS SCAM with Mastercoin and people unbelievably trust him AGAIN!  it's amazing.  I think he just has connections in these payola media outlets/blogs and he just gets his stuff promoted and people buy it.
@_date: 2014-07-26 23:40:05
So you 
1) **WILL NOT OFFER REFUNDS**
2) defer to your 'legal team' as to this decision and disclaim any responsibility.
Vitalik - you are looking more and more like a crook and less like a computer genius.  If you believed in the value of these things, you would offer a refund, it's really very simple and straightforward.
@_date: 2014-07-26 20:51:16
counterparty is not without flaws but the organization is MUCH more solid.
@_date: 2014-07-26 22:04:24
so that they are not legally liable to investors.  Pretty obvious.
@_date: 2014-07-26 22:02:48
and did you notice this?  
Charles H. leaves Ethereum: 
@_date: 2014-07-26 22:59:25
do you think this clause that it's not 'an investment' is going to get you out of trouble?
what have these people bought exactly?
the GmbH is German or Swiss?  Don't you think that having all these embedded corporations just makes your whole operation look even more fraudulent?
and btw - if you are an officer in a foreign corporation laws regarding financial fraud and malfeasance certainly apply.  I hope you consulted a personal lawyer on this.
@_date: 2014-07-26 23:09:07
I wasn't dumb enough to buy into this.
This isn't a threat - Im just tired of seeing one scam after the next.  You haven't got me convinced you're running a technology operation and nothing about what you've done here, or done in the past suggest you are making a sincere effort to bring some sort of value to either investors or the public.
Nor am I a prosecutor.  Im just doing what you might call amateur reporting?  certainly none of the major bitcoin blogs such as yours gives accurate information at this point.
**You need to state who is responsible for the investment money garnered through your recent sale of Ethers** so that those who did input money know who to take legal action against if they feel there was malfeasance.
If you fail to do this, it just proves that you are running another Ponzi scheme.  Your excuses are lame and pointless. Your technology is mostly meaningless garbage in my view and you're just highlighting a number of technical buzzwords to convince people to input money.  Mastercoin did the same exact thing, as did Bitshares.
@_date: 2014-07-26 21:31:35
are you kidding me Vitalik?
WHO HAS ACCESS TO THESE FUNDS GAINED FROM THE SALE OF ETHERS?
@_date: 2014-07-26 17:46:35
"Unless you’re so new to Bitcoin that you’ve never heard of BitShares, Ethereum, or Mastercoin"
what this article fails to mention is that these 3 projects are practically the same group of people making the same promises and reselling these crypto-properties.
ponzi-scheme anyone?
@_date: 2014-07-26 22:45:27
so just to confirm with you:
**VITALIK, YOU ARE UNWILLING TO STATE WHO CURRENTLY POSSESSES THE MONEY GAINED FROM THE SALE OF ETHERS?**
first this was a 'great transparent open source project' now it's all about secrets and confidentiality?  who are you kidding?
@_date: 2014-07-26 22:37:50
these guys have been running rackets for a while now...
@_date: 2014-07-26 23:42:41
completely overhyped?  BY WHO?
I'm not posting to your lame forum, I'll post here where the mods can't censor my questionings.
@_date: 2014-07-26 21:38:05
were investing in a unknown undefined team to solve an age old computer science problem that might be equivalent to creating an anti-gravity device?
@_date: 2014-07-26 21:46:50
the fact is that Vitalik may still be liable under SEC laws.  They are clearly selling securities products even though they have some complex technical explanation.  If Vitalik is profiting from the sale of these products, that are marketed as investment products, then he may be liable.  He is a canadian citizen, so the result will be he will be barred from conducting business in the US and will likely face fines.  I wonder if he is aware of this?  Does he have a personal lawyer or is he taking the corporate lawyer's word for it?
Given the scale of this whole thing, I tend to think this will be the LAST of these IPO scams.
@_date: 2014-07-26 21:36:30
WHO ARE THE MEMBERS?
jesus it's like Im dealing with a pathological con artist.
@_date: 2014-07-26 22:55:05
_you are going to end up in jail or with a very large fine my friend._
@_date: 2014-07-26 22:53:58
you really have to be joking here.
so the people who gave money to this *thing* have no idea who is responsible for this project?  this money could go to hookers and coke for all we know and no one is responsible?
it's not about posting private keys it's about **STATING WHO IS RESPONSIBLE**.
again **YOU ARE UNWILLING TO STATE WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS?**
and you also suggest btw- that **you know who is in charge**.
