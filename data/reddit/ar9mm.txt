Nah.  This only means that Bitcoin doesn't fall under the Fed's purview.  She says FinCen (a government agency) has authority to regulate bitcoin to control money laundering.  If the Federal Government wanted to make bitcoin illegal to use in the U.S., it easily could do so under the commerce clause.  Whether it could enforce that is a whole other story (see, e.g., anything that has ever been banned).

No, her comments are limited to the Fed, which makes sense since the Fed's sole expertise is banking and Bitcoin bypasses the banking system.  She specifically said "[FinCen] has indicated their money laundering statutes are adequate to meet enforcement needs." If FinCen had no ability to enforce those statutes, her comment would make no sense.  Obviously, their abilities will be somewhat limited, both technologically and in terms of resources, but they will be able to take targeted actions -e.g. Silk Road.

Again, take the example of food. Food has utility because you can eat it.  If you don't have any for an extended period of time you may "starve."  The food doesn't become less edible (lose its utility) merely because someone else says "hey, food has no value!" (i.e. subjective expression of value). Because of this utility, food has intrinsic value.  
In the case of a currency, which is a medium for exchange, it *does* lose its utility (ability to exchange for goods or services) if everyone agrees (subjectively) that it has no value.  Hence, it has no inherent value.
Note that intrinsic value doesn't always equal market value.

I see a lot of confidence on this sub that BTCs will go "to infinity and beyond" but I don't understand why people believe that.  Can someone explain to me the rationale behind why BTCs should increase in value?

@_date: 2013-11-07 00:49:19
You are confusing what I've said (and the fed, too). I don't mean that intrinsic value means an absolute, objective value.  Of course, the degree of intrinsic value will vary person to person and is highly subjective. The value of a basic lean-to is nothing to someone who owns a house but could mean life for someone else.  But the fact remains that the shelter has utility that has value to someone.  For bitcoin, it's value is as a means of exchange and a store of wealth.  Both if these functions are contingent upon its adoption as a currency.  If everyone tomorrow decided not to accept it (not saying that will happen or easily could happen), it would lose its value entirely.  There is no fall back utility, like gold.  Fiat likewise has no intrinsic value if it is no longer accepted (as it often isn't used during hyper inflation or foreign currency black markets).

You presume that Bitcoin will be the preferred crypto currency forwever.  But you forget that currencies do come and go - gold, after all, went from near universal use to not being a legal currency in a very rapid fashion.  If Bitcoin loses popularity as a currency it ceases to be a currency, store of wealth, or anything else.
Also, the dollar *is* a store of wealth.  It's just not a very good one because of inflation.  Gold and bitcoin are better (at the moment) because of the appreciation.  The big problem is that scarce currencies that are viewed as an investment make for crappy currencies because they promote hoarding over exchange.

The underlying technology is a separate issue.  If I buy bitcoins and they fall out of favor, they are worthless.  The fact the technology could be re-purposed (such as for securities, like the IBM guy gave as an example) doesn't resurrect the value of the bitcoins themselves.

It's very influential, but be aware it is not universally accepted.  Folks like Warren Buffet and George Soros certainly take issue with some of the hypothesis.

The relative lack of transactions should be alarming, not encouraging.  You can't sustain crazy rapid appreciation if it isn't performing its purpose as a currency.  It can't be a store of value in the long run if it isn't used.  The overwhelming majority of BTC are held as speculative investments, not used as currency. And, it can't be used as a currency if it remains so volatile and the price keeps shooting up.

It's a "currency" that people don't actually use as a currency (and for good reason because it's way way way too volatile to be a serious currency).  The vast majority of transactions (the volume of which is still very small) are purely for speculation (and most other transactions are for illegal purposes).  As a result, BTCs have been transformed into commodity (hence all the comparisons to gold or silver). The problem is, it has no value as a commodity! 
Gold, by contrast, is tangible, has actual industrial, electronic, jewelry, decorative, and even culinary uses.  It has also been a preferred store of value for literally thousands of years.  Gold is also actually scarce.  I know BTCs are "limited" to the arbitrary 21 million figure, but they are still subject to forking (see, e.g., the .7/.8 issue) and virtually infinite subdivision.  More importantly, there is no protection against new competitor coins - BTC's scarcity is artificial; you can always make more 1's and 0's.  BTC has virtually no hold on the consumer market so it could easily be substituted out.     
Currencies derive value from the faith given to it by its users.  Here, there is no reason to have faith: you have shadowy unnamed creators, extreme volatility, weak exchanges, ease of price manipulation, the cloud of pending regulation due to the illegal usage, and virtually no limit to competitors introducing alternative cryptocurrencies.

I'm not "considering" intrinsic value at all, I'm merely rephrasing what the Fed paper means by the term.  When they say bitcoin has no intrinsic value, they aren't denigrating it, they are just pointing out it isn't a commodity with value separate and apart from its function as currency.  Indeed, the Fed paper correctly points out that fiat money lacks intrinsic value, too.

A commodity has utility.  For a currency, it's utility is as a facilitator of transactions.  If the price continually rises (as occurs when you have inflation), it cannot fulfill its function as a facilitator of transactions.  For "ordinary" currency, central banks try to keep the value as flat as possible.

I'm sorry but your logic is just not even in the ball park (edited to add: I didn't downvote you). 
If you want to talk air, the proper understanding is that air has intrinsic value because you die with out it.  It has a low (non existent) market value because it's not scarce.
Fair market value is the aggregate subjective value humans place on assets.  Intrinsic value is an object's underlying utility.  You wouldn't say food has $X intrinsic value, you would say it has X kCal intrinsic value.

I find the scarcity argument bizarre because there is no protection against the next bitcoin.  They actually can't make more land (or gold, or oil, or ...), but they can always make more 1's and 0's.
Also, from scanning the sub it looks like there was a pretty widespread belief that at some point "big money" would begin investing in bitcoins.  This isn't really a value proposition, more of a "greater fool" theory.  It also fails to take into account that real "big money" like pension plans, insurance companies, or public companies almost certainly can't legally invest in bitcoins (or, more accurately, they could but their attorneys would tell them they run a huge risk of fiduciary liability).
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:34:12
Traditional currencies "fail" at doing it because they increase supply without creating additional value.  
A skyrocketing price for bitcoins seems to only make for a lousy currency.  No one would use it for transactions, to invest in firms, provide credit, non-essential consumption, etc.  Instead, you would just mine, buy, and hold and spend as little money as possible.  Is it a recipe for a new financial oligarchy especially given the arbitrary, finite supply?
Bandwidth isn't comparable to currency because its value doesn't decrease when the supply increases.
Also, "random walk" doesn't mean "wild gyrations" it just means a series of random steps - the random walk can produce "wild" outcomes or flat ones.

You listed one variable (the two laws you listed do NOT support the notion that any asset is continued to grow forever).

Okay, fine compare it with shares of the South Seas Co. Shares began at about 100 pounds in Jan. 1720, went to a shade under 1,000 on July 1, fell to 800 by August ("we're still up 800%!") before falling back to about 100 at the end of September.
Still too long ago? Try the Great Depression.  When the market crashed in 1929, on Black Thursday itself, the market declined only 11% ("We're still up 150% over 1925!"). It took nearly 4 years to hit bottom. 
Lesson: Bubbles don't completely burst (lose all their value) in one day.  It takes time.
