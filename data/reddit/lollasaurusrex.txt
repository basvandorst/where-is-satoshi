Could still be a dip until it goes below 12500 imo. Then it would change from a steep dip during a recovery to a continued downward trend from the ATH. 
Based on the 24 hour charts.

That is a fair and reasonable response that gave me some new info/perspective to consider.

I doubt it as well, but if it has the same growth rate in 2018 and 2019 as it did in 2017, then it will.

Oh absolutely. Like I said, I highly doubt it. History is no true predictor of future performance, in either direction, for a massive number of reasons. 
It's just not the most ridiculous financial prediction/expectation that many make it out to be. 
My guess is that barring some major world regulatory shake ups, which are for sure possible and are not necessarily going to have a negative effect only, we will see continued fairly high % growth rates for the next 3-5 years, with a reduction in it's % growth rate year over year.

Yup, I played the volatility over the last week with an assumption of a general downward trend and am up a bit over 38% since Dec 9th. 
Everyone wants 50% gains all in one buy and sell. Lots of 2-3% gains is often safer and can achieve big returns in aggregate.

This is not a better analogy unless the person has somehow locked themselves in to an ever increasing set of losses. 
If I put in 1k, the most I can lose is 1k. I can't lose "maybe eventually the other arm and legs".

Doesn't that technically make paying your state taxes in Arizona a taxable event at the Federal level?

That makes their comparison to the incorrect assumption that atoms cannot be divided perfect lol.

So you're saying there is a unit of BTC smaller than a satoshi?
