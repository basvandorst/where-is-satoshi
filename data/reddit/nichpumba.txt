again, never store your btc or litecoin on an exchange. make sure you always have control of the keys to the coins - otherwise it's just weak security on your part
@_date: 2014-07-11 13:14:17
I don't think litecoin will ever be as big as bitcoin but it will be the strongest alternative and complement to it - just like visa has AMEX, mastercard, and Discover.  Dogecoin however is a definite no, it was started as a meme and will pass like they all do

+0.01 LTC - like stocks my best form of advice is to take a long term position and buy and hold, I have done this in both BTC and LTC and has thus paid off very well.

It is my understanding that the asic miners used for BTC and LTC are not the same since SHA and Scrypt require different technologies and memory requirements

Nice - would you guys consider Litecoin too?  +0.01 LTC

@_date: 2014-06-17 15:42:21
+0.01 LTC  - i think prices will drop for technology that is not at the forefront of mining.  The most efficient and powerful miners will always be more expensive though, just like any computer tech

The trolls have been saying crypto is dead for years now - and they've been proven wrong for years
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:38:27
I agree with you - and somebody needs to provide actual proof that it's real or this is some EPIC trolling on the part of China
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:12:04
The PBOC rumor is just a rumor until the PBOC says it's true or fake - then it can become actual news.  This ranks up there with newsweek declaring they found Satoshi.  Buy on rumors sell on news

+0.01 LTC - I agree that those who basically bought at the top have lost money but also a lot of people in crypto expect 100% returns over 3-5 days - those were the old days as the market matures I think smaller rises and falls are what we are in for.  I like to think long term (3-5 years) and in looking at that I think you will still win
@_date: 2014-05-13 22:35:45
I like their reporting - especially on their HBO series.  It's seems to be like CNN, if CNN wasn't a bunch of pansies.  But they do try to look at stories from both perspectives so I hope that they do focus on more than just SR or GOX

+0.01 LTC   - I don't think price is necessarily the biggest thing right now - it's just LTC also needs some exposure along with all that BTC is getting, main issue is adoption for both of these cryptos

I see most of the talk on here is about bitcoin (as it should be because it was in the bitcoin subreddit) however your company also deals with Litecoin and in doing so how do you see the Litecoin ecosystem in China as well as the rest of the world?  And from reading some of the questions and answers about bringing your trading platform to the US markets, will you also be bringing LTC to this including HFT?
