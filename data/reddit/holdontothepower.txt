Lol, 2900-3200, i don't know if you already noticed, but this a death cycle. It's already been mentioned before: blockchain is the technology. Great technology. Btc has absolutely no future. It's a ponzi scheme. Nobody's going to invest in this mess, forget about the bullrun.

Microsoft proved to be useful after the .com crash, for billions of people. Whole different thing with btc. Nobody in his right mind thinks btc is useful and nobody uses it. There is a pretty good crypto that could actually be useful, it's called tether. You can use it to buy stuff, its value is pretty much stable. So why is everyone obsessed with btc, which is useless. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 04:56:29
No, they can't handle any criticism. Totally off reality, living in a bubble. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 03:18:30
Only fools think this is some usual correction. It's not. The project has failed miserably. No adoption, no use case, pure speculation, constant ups and downs in price without underlying value. Everyone pulled his money out, what's left are some crazy libertarians and people with a gambling addiction. Be smart and take your loss.  Sometimes you need to accept defeat.

Uhm, it has been said millions of times: btc is not a store of wealth cause people buy it to speculate. In order for something to be viable as a speculative asset, it must have an underlying value (like stocks). That could be a store of wealth or a currency to buy something (but it is not due to high volatility). Thus, Btc is neither of those two, it has no underlying value. It keeps going up and down. Pointless. This has nothing to do with being mature. It's a fundamental flaw that we have seen for over 10 years: same volatility, same shit, same fundamental flaw. You could add 5 billion holders, price would still fluctuate massively. Because: no underlying value. 
Holders deserve to be insulted, not because they bought it, but because of their massive cope. If you're not able to resist criticism, you're a weak dumbass. It is what it is. 
For stating this, you get banned by these dumb coping mods.

I don't take anything personal. If this is your mindset, then I have nothing against it. What irritates me is the constant complete denial of sensitive subjects from some holders, like the lack of underlying value, and the constant cope of holders. I have invested in btc as well (gambling). So what, does that mean you can't address some fundamental flaws? Should i cheer like a dumb cheerleader, like all these sheeps?
@_date: 2018-12-09 07:02:10
Because I was banned for telling the truth. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 15:32:05
Stop coping you dumbass. People that critize btc have all the reason to do that atm. You're still coping while the ship goes down. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 07:31:05
But this can't go on any longer. This is steeling money and should not be tolerated by any government. Government should step in immediately and stop this manipulation madness. Banning btc is an option to protect everyone. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 11:04:02
How is this trolling? It's simply the uncensored truth nobody wants to hear on this board. We have a system that works perfectly fine for ages, because of non-fixed supply, and here comes the libertarian donkey, who knows nothing about economy (never had a job, never had to earn money, never had a business), thinking he can invent the wheel again. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 20:42:46
Then stop telling people the coin will be adopted in the future. In order for that to happen, in order for people to use it as a mean to buy stuff, the volatility must go. Conclusion every child can draw: the coin is going nowhere. It has no underlying value. That's not what the libertarian donkey believes. He believes that btc somehow magically loses its volatility in the future, because of more trust. ''But but it's a young market'' says the libertarian donkey. Despite the fact it exists for more than 10 (!) years and the volatility is the same as ten years ago, while the amount of holders is much much larger. The libertarian donkey doesn't believe in fundamental laws like gravity, he doesn't understand simple laws even a child could understand. He lives in a bubble and shuts down every critical voice. As a last resort, he just bans people he doesn't agree with. Now tell me, how healthy is it that every Telegram group and this btc board has become an echochamber and mods are banning people all the time? In what kind of world do you fcking live? You want to shut down reality? Wake the fck up. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 08:31:51
So you want a completely manipulated market, like now? This has nothing to do with trading, let alone with fair trading. Also, btc has proven to have no use case in more than 10 (!) years.  I don't know why governments tolerate this. Time for a strong leader like in China to step in and shut it down. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:58:06
NO. TWO WORDS: FIXED SUPPLY. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 10:36:57
One last time: deflation is NOT good for the economy, not good for the people. Inflation is good. People actually use that money because of inflation, spend it, which keeps the economy rolling, something that doesn't happen with btc and will never happen, because of fixed supply, which leads to high volatility. Fiat currency is a system that worked for centuries, and still works. Balance of Btc after 10 years: failed system because of fixed supply, because of deflation. Result: nobody uses it, no use case. This is what happens when you let an engineer invent something instead of an economist: calculations all wrong.  
@_date: 2018-12-09 07:12:14
Should btc be banned from public space now that it's clear it has no use case?  It's being heavily manipulated by whales at the moment, making 90% lose money by sheer manipulation. How long should this be accepted? Every other company would have been banned, but this thing can go on and on? It's a shame government doesn't step in.  They should protect the people. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 04:23:33
I have put enough constructive criticism: fixed supply/no underlying value/fundamental flaw etc. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 21:27:25
It doesn't mean anything. There still is no underlying value and price could go back to 0.01 as easy as it went to 3400. It's all based on someking of weird, illogical belief the coin will be adopted by the mainstream to make payments. But that doesn't hold when we deal with a coin that has fixed supply. So, when reality finally kicks in, and people start losing their belief (which was based on air), the whole thing implodes, which might be happening now, as we might be witnessing a death spiral. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 20:05:32
You seem to think that the volatility is caused by the fact it's a young market and lack of trust. I try to explain you, it has nothing to do with that. Even if tomorrow, US government came out with a statement backing bitcoin, it still would be as volatile as today. People would accumulate because of renewed trust, and then sell till the next massive drop. The volatility is NOT due to a lack of trust, but due to speculation and lack of underlying value. It is inherent of the system Satoshi created, because of fixed supply. You can't just decide to fixate the amount and expect the system to work on its own. Fixed supply sounds cool and fun, until reality kicks in and people see the coin is going nowhere. Trust has nothing, nothing to do with this. : Look at tether: the value is pretty much stable compared to bitcoin, because of volatile supply. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:44:05
Are you that dumb? Tether supply and demand is carefully monitored/regulated to maintain a stable price. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:50:36


Existing currencies took hundreds of years? What are you talking about? Show me a currency that had this extreme volatility during history? You will not be able to name one. You seem to think that with more holders, volatility will drop. This is not true, and it has been proven already. Volatility won't drop a bit. It's not the amount of holders that cause the volatility, but the fixed supply. That's why the currency of the smallest country in the world, with way less holders than btc. has way less volatility. I hope you understand the system now and why this whole project will lead to nowhere. Stop being an ideologist, look at the facts and speak about facts. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 04:01:13
'Think for themselves' but can't handle the slightest criticism, as you can see on this board. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 05:08:13
We need a new, better coin. This coin is leading to nowhere, it is a completely failed project. We need a coin without fixed supply to handle volatility. We can learn from the mistakes that were made with btc and try to build something better. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:54:14
  
Of course, a couple of them survived. They had value. Btc and all other coins, except stablecoins like tether, have no value. Satoshi made a fundamental mistake by not addressing volatility. Every other coin is useless as well. They are worth nothing. Time to put them in the trashcan and invent something better based on blockchain. This just doesn't work. The whole system is flawed. The volatility comes from the fact it has no underlying value, so it keeps going up and down all the time with huge swings. Pointless. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 12:11:43
Lightning is not going to change the fundamental flaw of btc: high volatility, no underlying value, no use case. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 02:51:39
Stop with these massive copes man, you're embarassing yourself. Everyone knows some (small) hedge funds stepped into btc last year and early this year. Doesn't mean 'big institutional money is coming in'. Besides, they're pulling their money out now and have big, big problems. This phrase 'institutional money is coming' is almost as stupid as 'Chinese new year'. There will never be big institutional money. It's over, the project has failed. Take your money out and feed your children. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:42:07
You don't understand. You don't understand what i mean with FUNDAMENTAL flaw. It means independent of amount of holders. You don't understand what i mean with fundamental flaw, because you don't understand the flaw. The fundamental flaw is the fixed supply. Fixed supply leads to volatility, leads to not using the coin to buy stuff, leads to the coin having no underlying value. Do you understand this? Now, you could say, but the underlying is store of wealth. No, because again: fixed supply, which leads to speculation, not a steady store of wealth. Now, you could say: but speculation could be its function, just like stocks. Yes, but ONLY if it has underlying value, like stocks or gold. So, this a vicious cycle. Do you understand the fundamental flaw now? It can be interesting for the first years, to speculate, when people still have idealistic ideas. Until people realize it has no function/underlying value, because of fundamental flaw of fixed supply. In order to fix the fundamental flaw, you need to get rid of fixed supply. Btc is doomed to fail because of fixed supply. ''But fixed supply is great, we will have no inflation!'' says the libertarian donkey, who doesn't understand fundamental laws. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 10:53:26
With gambling, we know the odds. With btc, the odds aren't clear, as it's manipulated behind the scenes, with over the counter transfers to manipulate the price. The whole system has failed, whether it is the manipulation or the inherent flaw of fixed supply, which leads to high volatility and no use case. People get robbed continuously. It's time for someone to step in and clean the place up. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 03:34:48
They are completely off reality. Bunch of basement dwellers that contribute nothing to society but knows everything best. Never took responsability for something, never earned own money, and most of all: very stubborn and can't handle criticism. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:19:06
By the way, in order to fix this fundamental flaw, you need to leave the fixed supply. Fixed supply doesn't work. This IS the fundamental flaw of bitcoin. It seems cool in the beginning, but it leads to implosion sooner or later. Maybe crypto could work, but not btc, it is fundamentally flawed because of the fixed supply. In order to reduce volatility, you need to reduce the need for constant speculation, so that you get a more steady value. This can only be done by augmenting the supply.. It will NOT happen by adding more holders, something people think on this board. Their argument is: it's still young, when more people hold it, it will become more stable and people will use it as a currency. Absolutely not true, and the facts speak for themselves. There is a reason governments look at the supply side of currencies. It is extremely important. ''But but governments are bad and we need to get rid of them''&gt; Says the libertarian donkey.
@_date: 2018-12-08 21:03:12
No, you are the stupid one. It was an example to make clear why adoption is impossible for bitcoin, with a fixed supply. I tried to explain it as if i was explaining it to a little child, so that the libertarian donkey, who lives in a fantasyworld, could understand. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 20:20:48
I cannot believe how dumb the cryptocommunity is. Sometimes it seems they have no knowledge of fundamental, simple laws. You talk with al holder, it's like talking with a donkey. All btc holders seem to believe the current volatility is due to lack of trust and the fact it's a young market. It has nothing, really nothing to do with that. The volatility is caused by fixed supply.  Btc will never ever be able to reach a point of low volatility due to fixed supply. You look at tether and you see it has low volatility.  Why? Nothing to do with trust, but with volatile supply. Even if US government came out with a statement backing btc tomorrow, btc would still be as volatile as today. People would accumulate and then dump the thing. Fixed supply sounds cool and all. In fact it leads to nowhere, as we can see these past 10 years: no adoption, no use case. Again: the fact it has no use case has nothing to do with the coin being young. It is a fundamental flaw in the plan, the idea, the system. It just doesn't work, and the sooner you realize that, the sooner you see the clear picture. It is doomed to fail in the long term. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 10:10:57
The problem is, it's not a fair game, it's no game at all. Playing a game, no problem, but the game is rigged, money is stolen from the people.

I read on Facebook people starting petitions to ban bitcoin in the EU because of the latest manipulation.  Is it time to ban it? Probably. At least it should be on the agenda by now.
