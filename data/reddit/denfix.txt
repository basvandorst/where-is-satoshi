stores will eat 3-5% alone from the card :(
also in germany you got the BaFin... so you need a licence for around 750.000€ 
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:45:51
SEPA tranfers can be reversed... atleast if you are sending from a german account to another one... + you will get a nice letter from the police you have to deal with. So there can be fraud.
Bitcoin.de. Takes time, unless you have a fidor account.
I try not to give coinbase my data.
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:10:52
just use kraken, iam there since 2 years and had no problems at all.
Only thing is the tier 3 stuff you need to do but than you can send the money the kraken bank account at the german fidor bank.

"you will need to provide us with your private key."
I thought that to encrypt a message for me the other person only need to have my public key so why do I need to give them my private one ? 
Sorry for the noob question iam new to pgp.
@_date: 2015-06-23 15:49:36


Thats true its not that easily. 
Of course it will only happen if there is fraud but thats why you need tier 3 at kraken.
It would be easy to just send money from a random account to a new fresh kraken account and than withdraw the coins.

what did i do wrong its just saying Please wait logging in...
@_date: 2014-05-15 11:28:15
so what if 3 nodes go offline ? 
and my files where only on this nodes ? 
So i can't reach my files from the "cloud" without uploading them again ? 
@_date: 2014-06-18 14:23:24
Take a look at DogeLove (in the pebble app store)it has a send to near by feature.
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:14:28
I use Kraken.com but as German you need to get verified with your passport over there.

Ah okey so iam right with the way to encrypt something thanks
@_date: 2015-05-11 22:03:01
kraken.com also got pgp ages ago.
@_date: 2015-05-10 18:53:49
its crashing as soon as i start it...
@_date: 2015-05-20 07:37:54
@_date: 2015-05-11 08:47:45
i reinstalled and it worked
@_date: 2015-05-23 20:06:59
got the same problem with breadwallet, with the last update they lowered the fee... sometimes it taks up to 2 hours ....
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:34:39
nice :)
@_date: 2015-01-26 15:56:57
Take a look at kraken.com (EUR SEPA Withdrawal (€0.09) - EEA countries only), together with them and a fidor account you could reduce the costs and raise the speed.
I like the idea but for bills up to 50€ iam not convinced to pay 5€ sorry.
A feature suggestion i got, is a app with an IBAN Cam detector that way it would be easy as f*ck to pay snail mail bills.
@_date: 2015-05-20 08:28:53
Did you think about micropayments?
that would be a nice addon so you can pay by minute and don't need to worry about minute you don't use.
But it would bring some more complexity in to the whole app.
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:17:33
They are the bests :)
@_date: 2016-06-20 06:17:44
There was a proposal that would encrypt transactions for everyone until they are in a Block. So that the Miners can not censor the network. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 15:04:03
In gift cards there will be 8-9% fee since everyone is going to take a cut..
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:28:17
I was asking the same, tell me if you find one :)
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:16:18
its only 0.2% fee i think thats more than fair.
@_date: 2015-07-30 12:21:22
i would use mycelium local trader on android
since there are no ATM anymore :(
@_date: 2016-02-15 07:29:06
But its a beginning that the core failed to deliver. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:07:13
but you cant use mycelium without android or?
@_date: 2016-10-28 21:57:39
Go some really ugly bugs with Jaxx it send a wrong amount that I did not enter (got fixed with an update).  Mycelium runs fine since years for me.
If you want function and security use mycelium. If you want nice UX and some more altcoins use Jaxx.

Yes gut und günstig nudels for 1€, but i just bought some to try bitcoin. (Keep the 5% up ^^) 
@_date: 2015-02-01 10:08:47
There was one guy on the irc how build this thing, it was the dogecoin irc.
i can crawl my logs if you like.
@_date: 2015-02-13 18:33:15
I need this so hard, installed it as a test and forgot the pin, now I can't reset it and use my hd key :/ even after 21 days
@_date: 2015-02-14 16:34:48
Yes i got the phase but every time i deinstall it and want to reinstall it. It downloads the app from iCloud with the old test phase :(
@_date: 2016-07-03 09:35:23
Is it not the case that with a smaller transaction you have to pay less Fee. So there is an incentive to use a new Wallet/  with segwit right?
