Despite not referencing BitGold in the Bitcoin whitepaper, Satoshi subsequently cited it as foundational to Bitcoin. Very odd.

No, bitcoin is not an investment scheme.

As could the dollar. Good luck.

We're talking about intrinsic value here. When the bubble bursts it could be worth $24B.

Glad I wasn't the only one.

Great reply, I have no clue what the true intrinsic value of bitcoin is (or an envelope for that matter) but I sure know it hasn't increased 300% in the last 4 months which is what's happened with the price. The sheer amount of speculation / "dumb money" out there (people buying bitcoin to make an easy buck, not to transmit funds securely or anything else) is what concerns me and what makes me think this is a bubble.

Appreciate the reply. You say you've been a believer since 2013, was that before one or both of the bitcoin bubbles which took place that year? And my understanding is that there were at least 3 before then.
I am equally confident that Bitcoin is the future of finance AND that we are in a bubble. I can't wait for the price to come down to earth and stabilize somewhat so I can feel secure about buying in as someone not living in venezuela, zimbabwe, or the like.

"we recommend that you stop accepting Bitcoin payments at least 12 hours before Mon Jul 31 2017 20:00:00 GMT-0400 (EDT)"
Would this also include purchasing Bitcoins from exchanges and transfering them between wallets? Thanks.

Thank you for your response. So to confirm, during the 12-48 hour window before the event there is no additional risk with purchasing/moving bitcoins?

They'd better be profitable, considering the outrageous fees they charge.
