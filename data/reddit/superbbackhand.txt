I fucking get it, you guys are short-sighted narrow minded assholes who can't grasp the idea of anything different in your lives.  Weird how this coin was developed to promote change you hypocritical fucks.

I've posted once on here? I thought you guys would like to see the some best case/worst case scenarios and results of which. Obviously I'm not welcome here so I'll leave, don't really want hate for trying to spread some knowledge...

heh, I actually believe that.  There are a lot of them so it probably happens a bit, did you even read it tho?  I'm a trader, I don't have an affiliation or connection to any coin, what motivates me to post is simply put, making money.  I did some pretty simple math and showed potential for investment, if a certain coin lives or dies, it doesn't bother me.  Just thought you guys had the same mindset as BTC forum users typically like to make money.  In short I'm not part of some spamming crew, the coin can die and it would phase me in the slightest but you must admit that there is potential if this coin doesn't die you can make some BTC off of it pretty easily.
