Well, looking at the dollar amounts before and after, yes.  But i did not account for minor fluctuations between when I bought the BTC from the terminal and from when i redeemed them from the site - about 5 minutes elapsed between so the price might have changed a bit.  I will check timestamps when i get back home to see how big the difference is.

So, just went down the street to the nearest ATM here in L'viv and tested it out.  The ATM itself charged a 2 hryven ($0.17) fee for a transaction, and you can put up to 10000 hryven (~$844) per transaction.  So obviously it's less advantageous with small sums regarding this fee, but the higher you go the less it matters.
I put in 58 hryven ($4.90) after ATM fee, and after getting my receipt and activating it on the site, I immediately got my BTC - 6.929 mBTC ($4.50) - minus the .1 mBTC ($.065) mining fee, that looks to be about an 8% commission.    Someone please check my math.
Not too bad.  I think I'm currently the only "business" here that accepts bitcoins, and I offer a 10% discount on my services, I think it isn't too nasty, at least starting out.  Like someone mentioned earlier, with time, there will be competition.

It's fine.  Darth is right, just don't go to the very Eastern part.  L'viv is perfectly calm, though.

I'm an English teacher.  I put the quotes there because sometimes it doesn't feel like much of a business, since I'm a one man show and all.  :)

Going to hijack my own comment here to explain a bit more in detail how this works.
As noted elsewhere in this thread, these 4000 terminals are pre-existing terminals used by a variety of services throughout Ukraine.  For example, you can use these terminals to pay bills, fill up your phone with credit, send money, etc.  They [look like this] ( and they are pretty much everywhere, although they belong to different companies.  
You go up to one, select the BTCU service from a variety of options, and it asks for your phone number, in case you want to receive your code on your cell.  I opted to just get a receipt with it printed on there.
Then you insert bills into the machine (think vending machine) and when you're done, it shows the ATM fee (*not* the BTCU service fee!!!) and you hit enter.  It spits out a receipt with an activation code, then you go onto the BTCU site, put in the code on the receipt, and the address you want the BTC sent to.  That's it.  
Bitcoins appear to be at market price, although I'd have to do more tests to confirm exactly.  So far, no hang-ups.  Super conveninent service and as soon as some more vendors appear out here that accept bitcoins, I will definitely be using these ATMs, even at a relative (&lt;10%) loss if it means promoting BTC.  Cool stuff.
EDIT:  Just saw point all this out before I did.  Credit to him for being faster.  :)

This could probably be one of the top ten rules of visiting Reddit, really.

I got that mining fee figure straight from mycelium - I'm looking at the transaction right here and it says "Miner fee:  0.1 mBTC" - so either Mycelium is full of shit or it's normal.  Is that not the current transaction fee?
Assuming $4.90/7.02 (transaction fee added) = $0.698/mBTC, and official is $0.646/mBTC, that's a 7.738% difference between the two.  Yes, you have to pay transaction fees and terminal fees, but it is what it is.

Crimea, no - there's only one bank in Simferopol which offers the service.
Eastern part - actually, besides Kyiv, the second highest concentration of ATM's/Banks offering the service are located in the Donetsk/Luhansk regions (very close to the fighting).  Take a look at the map on their site.  My friend from Kharkiv (also East) just bought some yesterday without any problem.  :)

My fault, actually.  I should have said "transaction fee" and not "mining fee."

Regarding bigger transactions - the problem is, the terminal did not show the fee for the transaction beyond the basic ATM fee, so even if I started a transaction just to see what the conversation rate would be, it wouldn't tell me until after I redeemed my BTC from the site.  I've looked over the btcu.biz site, and they don't specifically mention a percentage rate - they just list their exchange rate from Ukrainian hryven to bitcoins. 
Right now it's showing 8314.11 hryven for 1 bitcoin - that's 701.85 USD, or 8.84%, which is worse than what I got in my transaction (see below).  Hard to say if they have a flat percentage rate or what.
Regarding press - no idea.  I'm not talking with anyone official on the subject, but I know some people who are involved in Bitcoin here, at least at an amateur level - I'll ask them to see if I can't find anything.

I'd be curious to see how many merchants actually "hold" their coins or at the very least use them to purchase goods and services from other merchants.
I belong to that group.  I'm sure there are dozens of us, dozens.  :)

Alright, here's my story.  Even if I don't get a tip, it'll be nice to share this with the community, since I'm pretty happy to support this idea.  :)
I'm an language teacher (English/Russian), living in Ukraine, and have been following BitCoin news for several years now.  I find the idea fascinating, and try to spread the good word as much as possible (even including it into my lessons).  It wasn't until recently though that I could actually participate in the circulation in a meaningful way, beyond buying/selling coins back and forth.
Traditionally, I am paid in cash here in Ukraine, but over the last year I've begun teaching primarily online via Skype.  Paying for lessons has been a constant problem for my online  students and I, since PayPal or such services are often restricted or charge very high fees for transferring money or exchanging currencies. (Ukraine included)
Then one day, someone gifted me gold here in response to a BitCoin related topic involving my beloved Ukraine, and for some reason, it just clicked in my head that I could start accepting BitCoin in lieu of PayPal transfers for those students who are interested in actually trying this thing out.
So, although I haven't gotten any students yet who are paying with BTC (I just made the announcement today), I'm hopeful that at least one or two people might be swayed to give it a try and support this idea, while providing a better service to those willing to take the risk.  
So, that's my story.  TL;DR - I offer English/Russian lessons for BitCoins.  Yay.  :)

Maybe not a native English speaker?  I was able to understand what they meant though, thankfully.

The word you were looking for was "delusional", fyi. (Sorry, English teacher :)))
