Yeah I also live in a country where an entrepreneur stands to lose all of his money, more often than not. Trust me, try to come to America and make a successful startup ISP. You will run lows on funds setting up as you fight the city to be able to even lay cable, the big boys don't want competition so they lobby the government, that's how America works. Money talks and they have a lot more of it than you. Also not many people have $15k to spare on starting their own goddamn internet

Goddamn you're as dense as a brick. You looked up government so it told you the different kinds, there's a reason I specified **Municipal** government (in case that's not in your vocab it means town) 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:02:27
I mean anything government controlled in the US is still way behind in tech, for the most part. They use old computers/printers/fax machines/etc until they HAVE to buy a new one

That's just blatantly false, Charter Internet, for instance, covers like 95% of the residents in my hometown and the others on at&amp;t (like one of my friends) has unbearably slow internet. How did it get this way? Well, small town, they already had money so they set up everything and that's how it's been. You're completely ignoring how costly it is to tear up ground and lay more cables down, and even if you did have the money you are blocked a lot of the time by municipal governments due to lobbying ISPs. If it was so easy just start one yourself

A lot of areas including where I live has one decent internet option. They have already begun shafting people over and if they wanted to charge exorbitant rates after net neutrality is repealed they could. Gotta love monopolies

Take a look at gdax, right when the news was announced the price spiked, dipped, and now is rising again hovering somewhere around $7840

Ugh just had this argument, I didn't explicitly state but I was talking about municipal government, the ISPs lobby local governments to prevent cable from being put down on city-owned land. Federal government doesn't give a rat's ass about that 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:47:43
You aren't even making points and I have a hard time understanding what the hell you're trying to argue cause you probably aren't sure yourself. This just in, the federal government is a lot different from your local government, that's why I said municipal and federal, then you spouted your definition trying to claim all government is the same. 
English motherfucker, do you speak it?
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:39:53
*Implies municipal government is the same as federal government* 
Who's special?

�� how did this trigger the bots, I'm scrolling through all the comments that I downvoted when I was hacked and then there's this

No no and just no. I buy something when I get more money (USD) if you want to think about it like this, might as well buy things now because that same amount of dollars will buy less in the future. Now let's say I have a bitcoin, which has a history of increasing value. I'm looking at buying something with that bitcoin but hold off because I think the bitcoin will increase in value, allowing me to buy more whenever I cash out, and I keep holding and holding and holding, because that's what everyone is doing, holding and hodling. Then when I'm ready to collect my gains, I just sell my bitcoin for USD, like everyone else 
Edit: Haven't you seen all these posts and comments about people buying coffee and stuff with bitcoin many months ago and everybody talks about how it was thousands of dollars spent on coffee in today's standards.

No, still early in Bitcoin's development, I basically started a couple weeks ago. The ol saying goes "The best time to buy was 2 years ago, the next best time is today" or something along those lines

I agree that I'm sure the book has better substance and is much more in-depth, but the movie was great, well directed and well acted.

I've never been in debt, when I get a paycheck or a gift of money or something I will buy something that I've been needing to get but have been putting off. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:05:06
I'm not saying that, I'm saying probably 90%+ of the bitcoin being bought/sold on the exchanges aren't from selling/buying a product, it's from people speculating in the price of btc.

Did we watch the same big short?
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:49:41
Well first of all the dollar doesn't lose value nearly as fast as bitcoin deflates, so it's not a horrible decision to just save cash if you can invest and gain a decent passive income. I'm confused about your second part, not sure what you're trying to say but people sell bitcoin because there are a bunch of day traders playing the market, not because they just got some from selling a product. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:30:19
I agree but btc needs to become a major currency first and be far less volatile. As of now it's just mostly seen as a place to hold money

?? For myself I spend when I need to buy something, the vast majority of people don't and can't buy things only when they're getting richer, people like to spend money and many dirt poor people instantly spend whatever money they gain
