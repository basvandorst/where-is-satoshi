While we were talking, I bought at the low of the dip ($3600) and I've made money. So yea. Im a happy man.
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:15:38
This is my guess. I really don't know 100% for sure, and this is just my interpretation.
 
Markets of smaller cryptocurrencies usually follow the massive trends of Bitcoin. Bitcoin, however, I'm assuming is only dipping because most of the miners are leaving to go to Bitcoin Cash, which is more profitable right now. So Bitcoin Cash price increases and decreases Bitcoin price, and all the smaller cryptocurrencies follow.

Holding since $600 to ~$4000 = making money. 
I'm not gonna panic sell, and I'm not gonna gamble. Too many people have lost that way, and I'm gonna take the safe (and wise) route. Don't look at the short term, look at the long term

The same applies for Bitcoin. Theres not one central person we can trust. There's literally nothing stopping someone from running off with our money. I definitely trust the Red Cross a lot more than anything Bitcoin

Oh, sorry, I didn't realize that you were bitcoin-yoda and that you know how he stores his private keys. 
I thought mine was secured very well too. I don't want to disclose the full details, but even if my house was robbed clean, nobody would be able to find it. I just never thought that a hurricane would be able to sweep it up.
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:54:15
I use Electrum, but I just bought myself a Trezor. Too bad Hurricane Irma came down to my house and now the shipping is gonna be delayed for a while..

I wouldnt say to buy from an exchange. From what I've heard, most of the ATMs just buy directly from miners so they get no exchange fees

If it was Bitcoin they wouldn't have all my information (private keys) to even steal it all in the first place.

With NiceHash, you can set it so that you literally only mine ZCash. Ive never had your problem, but there's a really simple solution

Do people use "sheeple" ironically?
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:50:55
1070 is definitely enough, but GPU mining is for altcoins. Check out NiceHash to mine and Electrum as a free open-source wallet
@_date: 2017-09-11 02:28:27
At the end of it all, even if his bitcoin is secure, the value isn't secure. In fact, Bitcoin is known for being extremely volatile. For all we know, Bitcoin could be worth less than a cent in a few years. It doesn't even need to die, it just needs to dip enough, and Yoda will be out on the streets.
Don't buy more than you can afford to lose.

I'm 100% sure that Google is NOT the biggest search engine in China. That's Soso and Baidu
I don't know about Facebook or YouTube, but I'd imagine those are also not the biggest.
I don't know where you got your information from....
@_date: 2017-09-11 02:05:54
Ignorance. Im a perfect example. I kept my private key in a lockbox (that's not very secure at all). I live in Florida, and Irma just wrecked my home (according to my neighbors). Im staying safely up in Canada right now, but for all I know the storm could've swept up that lockbox and somebody could be enjoying all my Bitcoin right now
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:31:45
If you properly store it, nobody will ever be able to figure out your private key
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:47:42
I'd say look into NiceHash to mine instead of focusing down on ZCash. It switches between the most profitable altcoins and the most profitable algorithms. Ive been insanely successful with NiceHash.
For a wallet, Electrum is definitely the way to go for free wallets. Open source and highly ttusted
@_date: 2017-09-11 22:00:27
Ah, you're probably right
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:27:31

Sorry, could you please explain where Bitcoin derives its intrinsic value?
@_date: 2017-09-11 12:16:03
Don't. It's all FUD. The only way to lose money in the world of Bitcoin is if you fall before the FUD.
@_date: 2017-09-09 07:32:09
I personally feel it can be interpreted both ways. You definitely have a point though
@_date: 2017-09-11 01:56:55
All they need is the private key. Fuck stealing it straight from the wallet. Just get those words and it'd be all over before he would even realize.
Hardware wallets are vulnerable too. Trezor themselves have admitted vulnerabilities before.

Im not one to tell you whether or not to start an ATM, or whether or not it's gonna be profitable. I just want you to be aware of the story of [this guy.](

@_date: 2017-09-11 00:42:25
That's a bit severe.. you're going to starve during a dip like what happened during Mt. Gox... and that's if somebody doesn't steal all of your Bitcoin before that even happens
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:58:33
Rule  of Bitcoin. Don't spend more than you're willing to lose.
From what I'm hearing, you're in a tough situation where you really can't afford to lose anything.
Yes, Bitcoin could make you a lot of money, but it's extremely volatile. I'm extremely sure Bitcoin will go up in price in the long term, but in the end it's all one big gamble. Get a job, and maybe put some of your paycheck into Bitcoin. But again, do not spend more than you're willing to lose.
@_date: 2017-07-22 01:21:04

@_date: 2017-07-24 15:29:26
You're missing the point that its a "split". As in, when you split BTC into BTC and BCC, you aren't creating new money, you're just diving that original money up. BCC isn't just creating new money out of thin air. It's taking money from BTC.
@_date: 2017-07-21 21:07:55
bought a few hundred dollars worth of games through bitcoin back when btc was ~600. i was shitting myself when the price raised to 3000
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:12:06
[Yes, online exchanges/wallets are bad. Check out Mt Gox]( 
I personally use Electrum. It's a very popular &amp; highly recommended desktop software, and it's definitely a lot more secure. It's always good to be able to own and control your own bitcoins. Also, if the blockchain splits, there's no guarantee that you will own crypto in both chains when you have an online wallet, and [Coinbase has already said that they won't give you both chains.]( 
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:12:28
Never thought of that before. Thanks

My parents lived in SA, cant say the same myself (U.S.)

Bitcoin Ticker works very well for me. It has support for many different currencies (including your EUR), its got great, easy to understand interface, and you get to choose who/what sites you get your information from. Bitcoin Tracker also has this really slick design that's nice to look at. It's definitely the best app for Bitcoin I've used so far.
Edit: and ofc comes with a nifty notification system by price or percent change
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:33:55
I'm sure you can find a Bitcoin ATM scattered around somewhere. Takes longer because you'll have to get there but the fees should be cheaper
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:14:30
My point is that it doesn't matter who said what, it's still a pretty good prediction.. even if it wasnt the original source
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:09:38
I don't see your point. It still very well predicted what was going to happen
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:34:56
screw FUD. now is always the best time. and if you dont wanna risk buying now when it could get lower, then just buy small amounts at a time so that you dont regret missing out by not buying now

You can just use Ethereum and establish the two different coins manually, or you can use hardware that accepts multiple cryptos. 
I don't think this is really gonna be necessary because of what might happen:
1) A fork probably isn't going to happen
2) BTC or BCC might wipe the other one out, so the other one has nearly no value
3) BTC and BCC might have equal value, but that means the original value was split so you wouldn't have any more money.
All this is doing is diversifying your portfolio for you, I guess. There's no "free money" about it unless something astronomical happens
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:39:00
