sorry mate i hear to many articles about people losing bitcoins or geting hacked or colapse of markets that its too risky for me to invest in that for now.    
each fail in bitcoin industry is like a echo and each succes is just a whisper.

maybe gambling in a RL casino altou its gamblin, yet you have a chance of win. also stock market feels more safe and can give a nice risk/reward return if you consider many factors or are just lucky.    
stock market profit happens almost weekly if u follow informed news sites about stock. also the best thing about the stock market is - when the crisis hits its the best time to buy stock.    
ill give u an example about nice profit from stocks: for example im interested in pc games and one year ago before the realese of witcher 3 which u prolly heard about the CD project stock price was about 14-16 units i was really considering buying their stock to make a nice profit after the game release.    
I followed their news and the stock price altou all in all i didnt buy them becoz i didnt had much cash to make it worth but just followed it for fun to see what happens.    
Then when the game got released the price went up to about 22-24 units. the fun part is - it had lets say a good knowledge about the games industry to lets say make an opinion if its gonna be a success or a fail. i didnt do the math but lets say i was about 30% profit in a few months - nice right? but i have to admit i didnt buy it coz no cash yet i know there are many occasions like this on the stock market. cheers mate

exactly the problem is you cant be really sure about the bitcoin price, and like i said on the stock market such occasions like 5-10-30% profit happen weekly - thats my point. check yourself some stock market sites almost all the info you need to decide is out there for free.

I hope the 2016 will bring more trust to bitcoin and more people will be interested in it.

Mate you really didnt realise something like this happens since the beginning of mankind?    
have you not read about human history or something?    
Is it really so difficult to come up with similar idea in matter of hours days?    
It's like you are currrently posting this on the internet and you tell me you never heard about something like this before?    
Do you play any mmo's? Any kind of longterm players in any mmo consider joining enemy factions to spy on them and gain advantage or destroy them....    
Sorry to hear that but this is nothing new, the green beret just described how it would look like. you could come up with this yourself if it would matter to you.

on the other hand its good for them, they dont live in constant fear for something to be happen.    
like one doesnt have enough oneself problems to get trough besides thinking about conspiracy stuff.
