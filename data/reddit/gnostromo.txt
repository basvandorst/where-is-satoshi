Even if they would have purchased it for a buck in the 90s it wouldn't be what it is today. They would have tanked it just like they tanked Yahoo

Thank you.
What is difference between LNS and Trazer and/or why do you prefer the LNS? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:53:06
Yes but your friends are reasonably intelligent.
Have you ever stood behind someone that has a hard time using an ATM/debit machine.
If it's ever going to be "real currency" it's going to have to be at least that simple.

Speaking of xmas is it possible to give/buy someone who has never done crypto some portion of a bitcoin as a gift?  My small purchase so far is through coinbase which I had to link bank or credit card... which I wouldn't want to do to a gift account.

So how's that work tax wise? If someone gifted me money or car or house worth 500k I would have to pay taxes on the value at that time. 
So does he owe taxes on it now? Or later? Or both? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:08:55
Yeah but I'm in my 50s and I get it (loosely, still learning, but I know how to search for answers). But I know people half my age that I guess just aren't too bright or just don't keep up with current events that just stare at me blankly or get all confused when I talk about it. I really think it's going to be a problem for the "luddites" unless we somehow dumb it down to work simply on their "smart" phones or as a card. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:38:11
Thanks! And Trezor is on my wishlist

Why should it? Right now it should not. 
Later if the supply and demand is just so, then it should based on the laws of the aforementioned S&amp;D.

It's tanking downwards Fast!!!!!! What do we do!?!!
(Someone say "buy the dip!")
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:13:21
Well yeah. Today it is billions if they sell. If they wait and the unlikely event that it tanks and they don't sell in time then maybe not nothing but not billions.

Newb question here... if this keeps rising (doubling) as I have witnessed... does the dip matter? Why not just buy when you can and watch it rise? I get that a dip makes you some more money but 9500 vs9800 and it rises to 100k wtf cares? Bye the dip bye the rise just bye before it rises more. No?

Is it odd we are excited about bitcoin hitting a round fiat number?
I mean people in other countries with different monetary system prolly don't care, right? And they get excited about omg 100 lira!!! Right? Rong?
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:30:07
Maybe look at more like how many times it has to double in value? 
Since I bought in a few months ago it has doubled. 
Which is prolly just coincidence but if it continues that trend...

I thought it was currency? 
@_date: 2017-09-18 07:12:18
I think (could be wrong) that the only thing they care about is the mechanics of it. If it's one type of cars they press a certain key or 3 and swipe and if it's the other, different keys and swipe.  
Also they get charged for you using credit, while you (might) get charged for using debit.

"I don't think many know what you do"

Is there bound to be some circular debt (made that term up just now) that could be cancelled if traced? Example : we owe Mexico $100 Mexico owes China $200 China owes Germany 300 and Germany owes us 400.
Well let’s just make it 0 100 200 and 300 owed. Why not do that?
