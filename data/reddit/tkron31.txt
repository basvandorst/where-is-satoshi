I hope you sat her down and explained to her exactly what Bitcoin is. But that is a cool coin.

tee hee. Probably going to be the case until we have quantum communiactions.
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:11:02
That could be helpful. Thanks.

I like it. That beer thing was funny too.

The obvious way to pass the value on to your customers would be to offer a nominal discount for customers who choose to pay with Bitcoin. If you have a rewards program, you might also offer extra "points" for Bitcoin payments.

Care to explain that, Grumpy Cat?

Retweeted this because it's worth showing off.

Best you can do is just quietly use Bitcoin like you normally would if you didn't feel the need to tell the whole entire world with them. Amazon may notice if they suddenly get a whole bunch of people redeeming e-gift cards they bought on eGifter. And you might try entertaining people at your favorite local pizza place with that Bitcoin Pizza story, but that should be the end of it. Let them investigate Bitcoin on their own if they're curious.

I don't count that as a "real" jobs board. It's just something that scrapes job listings from everybody else. I mean more like Freelancer.

Find a remittance service that works in their country if there is one. If you can't find anything, just send them the Bitcoin and let them figure it out.

A little better. The last paragraph could use a overhaul. If you need a native English speaker on your staff, I could help.

Oh, doesn't Bitwage operate in Canada?
@_date: 2015-03-02 23:13:25
It could be done. In fact, I think there have already been attempts to make paying with Bitcoin as easy as holding a tablet close to a reader and then hitting a confirm button (what I think Apple Pay does).
@_date: 2015-03-20 01:23:39
Maybe. But I can still say "I told you so."

Whoever posted this to 247cryptonews needs to work on their English.
@_date: 2015-03-02 19:53:09
True enough. I just don't think the CIA actually created it.
@_date: 2015-03-17 00:42:04
Craaaaaap, I shoulda watched this! Is it gonna be on Youtube?
@_date: 2015-03-02 22:48:29
Now this is funky. Why not just place a Bitcoin ATM?
@_date: 2015-03-03 02:43:00
I do understand about lack of funds. I'm pretty sure there are advanced ESL lessons on Youtube if you ever feel like improving.

You really ought to try CreateSpace when you have a document that you think is worthy of publication. It's free, and you get a no-upfront-cost listing on Amazon too.

I actually think you guys are cool for working on making Bitcoin remittances easy. I was just checking you out; I see you're still in Beta?
