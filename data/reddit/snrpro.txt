Yea, I think you're right. I didn't even consider that when adding my business account to Coinbase. I just figured I'd be a good tax abiding citizen and use my business account rather than a different one so it makes it easy on my accountant...blah.

What are you talking about? I mentioned I had high Coinbase activity in my account. Then less than a week after the activity I get a letter from Chase saying they chose to close my account. Then I googled "chase bank closed my account coinbase" and it's obviously the issue based on everyone else saying the same thing. I didn't cancel any coinbase transactions and even if I did that wouldn't have been fraud. How is canceling a transaction, fraud?
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:46:57
Yea, I'm guessing the volume is low enough to float by. Just be careful when you do larger transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:52:17
I had no idea it was an issue with big banks until it was too late, unfortunately.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:46:20
They're giving me till mid February to sort it out which is nice at least.
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:44:55
Did you withdraw any USD through Coinbase yet? I think that may have been the first time I sold that set off the red flags. I deposited here and there in the past with no issues also. I would definitely switch to a different bank regardless though if you plan on keeping it.
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:00:05
Yea, I could see that. Unfortunately, I didn't consider that beforehand :\
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:10:34
Smart. I think the best thing you can if is to open a separate account just for crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:48:45
Unfortunately I had no idea it was an issue until after the fact :\
Didn't even think about it which is why I made this post. Hopefully others don't make the same mistake.

They didn't close my personal account...just my business account where I had the Coinbase transactions. So I'd recommend adding an account with Chase that you just use for Coinbase and you can attach it to your other accounts (so you can just login to your same account online). Then if they kill that one, it won't matter.

Multiple buy and sells.
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:00:36
Out of curiosity, what kind of volume are you pushing through your bank?
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:42:35
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:08:42
Seems so :\ Unless it was just the higher volume sets off flags in their system.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:53:40
It wasn't that high...I'd be extremely careful with that. Use a small bank or create a separate account just for this.
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:48:54
I did deplete my account by paying off a bunch of business expenses for end of year tax purposes but no, no issues like that.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:41:37
I did ask them. I even brought up Coinbase but the lady on the phone said she couldn't tell me why. I even said, hey can I just move Coinbase to a different bank and she said it's a final decision.
I was doing fairly large transactions buying and selling. Like I said earlier, I've bought in the past without any issues but not this much volume and not selling also. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:28:30
Holy smokes. You got hit harder than I did. They just killed my biz account and left my personal. Which was your coinbase attached to?
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:26:44
I have a pretty good relationship with my branch. It seems they wont be able to over-ride this but do you think they can set me up with a new account if I tell them I'll keep Coinbase to another account?
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:36:02
UK Banks &gt; US Banks

Read a couple posts up ;)
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:25:27
It’s highly likely. Out of curiosity was it a personal or business account?
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:46:02
It was over 25K both ways. Multiple transactions. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:50:37
I tried. No luck. I'm going to try to set up a new account at my branch and explain the situation. I have a decent relationship with them there. Hopefully they can do something.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:52:55
Thanks I'll give it a shot. Going to go to my branch tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:32:41
Btw check out this guys response on my other thread (coinbase shut me down shortly after chase did so that might be something you may have to watch out for as well). Seems pretty spot on: 
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:49:34
I don't think they would have, honestly.
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:12:33
Thanks for explaining all that. I actually did use Coinbase for my business, however. I accept Bitcoin on my business website.  
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:09:20
I did multiple transactions buying and selling. Maybe 50k volume total in December. It’s the first time I’ve sold so I’m guessing that’s it but it could just be the high volume. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:54:21
Accurate lol.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:20:38
Thanks for the info. I called my Chase branch to look into it further and she's supposed to call me back today with what my options are. I'll definitely not use it with my biz account in the future though next time. I thought I was doing the right thing tax-wise by putting it in my business account. This is a twisted system.
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:24:07
Nope. Just buying and selling. Had a bit more activity than usual in December and about a week later got a letter in the mail saying they're closing my account.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:11:54
They did. They said January 1st :\

My buddy said this to me the other day. I don’t know enough about ETFs to know any better. “Once etf is created an inverse etf follows it allows for short position. It's a ploy to market to the little guy so to squeeze out every last drop.”

Is there a site that lists all websites that accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-06-16 19:45:27
I was banned from Coinbase long ago and they still won’t tell me a reason. Just switch to Gemini. No biggy. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 08:35:44
There was a time when people appreciated the fact that these “thots” accepted Bitcoin. Erik Voorhees even encouraged the adoption from these sites because he saw the big picture. Guess times have changed.

I don’t know about his valuations but he does make a lot of valid points. I particularly liked this comment: “Fiat currency will eventually become as passé as trying to pay for coffee with pennies.”
