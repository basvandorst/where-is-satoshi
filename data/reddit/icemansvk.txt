Well I am pretty sure that official authorithies in many jurisdiction will soon start working on that case even if Bitfinex executives has not started any procedure.
There is a lot of money gone and I am sure some people will see it as inside job. As I see most of Bitfinex executives are EU citizens, which means this case is not anymore commercial issue of company but potential criminal prosecution of statutory body and/or executives. I am not sure how about US but at this potential fraud loss it is potentially in category 12+ years in jail if they are proved guilty in most of EU jurisdictions.
To be in their shoes I would very openly and actively work with all law enforecement authorithies of course unless they have anything to hide...

Anyone can confirm to succesfully received any significant amount of BTC/LTC/ETC or USD yet ? 
I have some confirmation from people with smaller amount of BTC transferred to them already. USD will take longer to process  I assume,,,
I am quite surprised as well BFXCoin keep up quite "good" price. I thought it would go to near zero very quickly...

We all deserve and shall wait for clear calculation and clarification with open books. They promised it in last announcement and we are eagerly waiting for 2 things now:
1 Clear and exact calculation how you ended up with 36% haircut
2 How much exactly BTX shareholder / executives / new investors are covering for this loss. Straight and clear number that we see in calculation in point 1
I assume these calculations has been already done so just write it down for us so we can check them
thank you and paging for some explanation here

I can also hereby confirm that my 5 digit USD withdrawal went smoothly and I got Express Withdrawal really this morning from HK to Europe bank. 
I am glad that in this shitty situation BFX at least keep up the word and promise and they have not announced bankruptcy like in GOX case.
I hope with time they will be able to repay BFXcoins and/or track hacker. i also hope next updates will clarify methodology of haircut % and explanations how all security measures has been breached / avoided.This is the only way to regain trust of customers

I fully agree at least they are trying to find solution. Noone is happy about what happened and only time and transparency will tell who is to blame. But I am nearly 100% sure Zane is not the one. He is at least doing what he can (and is allowed) to update us on the whole situation.... Really too much misplaced anger here...
What would you better expect ?  Silence and no answers like in MtGox case ?
