It's a different article referencing the same study.

Well if it produces the desired effect what does it matter?

Which is a type of pyramid scheme.

Those are documents specifically related to whether a person in a scheme will legally be considered a co conspirator in that specific jurisdiction. If a person is in a Ponzi scheme and starts promoting the scheme does that make the scheme a pyramid scheme? Legal definitions of things as determined by a specific court differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and differ to the general meaning used in plain language.

This is the leading business publication in my country, New Zealand. Pretty cool seeing bitcoin in here.

Who says it damages bitcoin's reputation? 
Drug dealers using bitcoin attests to it's security against 3rd party attackers. Namely hackers and government agencies. One of bitcoin's key selling points is that it is outside of government control. There is no point in crying about bitcoin being used for these transactions because it is in it's nature as a cryptocurrency to be used for them.

We get it.

You're only pointing out the correct definitions for determining whether a member of a scheme is guilty of carrying out the scheme. Those definitions are used for the purpose of determining criminal liability in a specific jurisdiction. If you know anything about the law then you should know that legal definitions for things are different to ordinary definitions for things. Different jurisdictions may have different definitions for these two schemes, but this does not matter because a casual news article such as this is not the place for legalese.  
Nowhere do I justify the imprecise use of language, I just stated that a ponzi scheme is a type of pyramid scheme.

Schemes like this give pyramid schemes a bad name.

Is SA obsessed with btc more than it's actual supporters?

So this is still happening all the time I guess? I haven't had this problem cause I've had an account for ages.
I hadn't used mt gox for a couple of months but just added LR a couple of days ago. Why did they change from the old LR instant deposit to the current mess where you do a personal transfer from LR and leave a reference for them to find or using exchangers who want 2-3%? It's so slow for them to add LR into mtgox now and who wants to give an exchanger money when you have already paid exchange fees to get LR anyway.

Yea i must admit I have thought about this to. Hopefully this does happen, although porn is a lot more accepted than it was 5-10 years ago. I still don't doubt that there are people who want to browse porn anonymously.

You should submit this to a bigger subreddit I see mass karma ahoy!

This is from a book that uses silk road in the name, it came out before the SR site. It sounds like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2011-10-18 01:56:56
Hmm this is an interesting thought, I looked around to see if I could find anything about them online and could't find anything. Although that could easily be the case with an online group of dealers.

Does anyone think it could be those responsible for the mybitcoin.com theft selling what they have left? Or someone linked to them getting rid of all the btc?

Yea even the words 'digital cash' set off my bullshit detector and I use online currency. 
@_date: 2011-10-18 04:09:42
It's not illegal though is it? People may as well use the exchangers on there, but I'm guessing they are pretty expensive.

If they did do it, they are dicks. If they didn't do it, and are just making out like they did, (most likely) they are dicks.

I've been hearing a lot about Mt GOX's new security measures and ID requirements. Can someone please tell me what these requirements actually are? I'm having trouble finding info.

Yea I thought the conference would  be responsible for the drop from 11+ but then it stabilized around 10. This made me think that the sudden drop is from something else rather than the post conference sellout. Also they didn't go up very much before the conference, so this drop indicates that more people were selling than were buying pre conference.

Awe c'mon, that's not very nice.

The benefits from that article would probably have come and gone by now. Usually when these kind of exposure events happen the rise is pretty rapid and closely follows the event.
@_date: 2011-10-16 00:57:40
What exactly are you advocating? Bitcoin in general? More use of Bitcoin where possible? Complete use of Bitcoin for all a person's financial needs?
