no, but they can lock their account for investigation, mark them for investigation, the company did not want it and paid up. With paypal being anal and stuff it is easier to pay up than endure their verification and disputes process. So yes, indirectly they do have some authority and enforcement power.

you talk to autists,libtards, bronies and neckbeards that constitute 90% of this subreddit like they are normal people. Spare your breath, it is useless. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:47:48
you libtard neckbeards have completely lost your minds. This subreddit is a toast, just like btc.

Internet is not for autists only, it can be useful in small and balanced doses.

ftfy: autist's brain. Only autists, bronies, neckbeards and libtards use btc. It will never be accepted and widely used.  BTC is autists' "money"

you are talking with a cult, turned into a cult. Save your energy and time, it is worthless to argue with a cult that is full of autists getting hard on bitcoin numbers. What people do not realize is that bitcoin is autists' heaven, numbers everywhere, patters, patterns, patterns and more patterns, more numbers, its like drugs for their sad little brains.

no, the only things crucial to human survival are altruism, kindness and social support. Math turns into weapon in hands of those who worship it for its own sake. We do not need math to predict our future, we **know** our future, it is environmental dergradation, overpopulation, wars and disease. As much as you love your math it will not stop any of these future (some are already current) maladies.

yea it should, cause both reddit karma and crypto currencies are equally imaginary and useless.

yes, you did fuck up yourself really good.
