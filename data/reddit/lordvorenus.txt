here is the thread that I started on BTCtalk regarding this issue:
Feel free to comment on it.. help me rise some attention, if possible make a bump post once a week or so.. Meanwhile I will PM the admins every 15 days preventing to be ignored / forgotten.

I always use bookmarks + LastPass addon with strong passwords (&gt;23 digits), so I can assure you that the vulnerability is at their side. If I'm correct, the victims are those who created an account using gmail :
This is the 1st time I get any account compromised... just disappointed no one was able to find the exploit and fix it since 2015 ?! what kind of open source community they call themselves?..

Agree, however I had to create another one in order to PM Cyrus and Theymos. 
Do you (or anyone else) know if there is any other way to contact the staff ? like IRC, email, reddit, etc ?

UPDATE: still no reply from Admins... several new reported cases on BTCtalk.

I end up here after searching for hijacked bitcointalk accounts, it seems to be that my account has been stolen recently. After several failed attempts trying to recovering it I don't know what to do / who to contact...
Can anyone help me?

I've been hacked also, it happened to be on 11th July.. find out today that someone changed my associated email !! (I was on vacation so didn't bother checking my secondary email account associated)..
The russian guy who hacked me already made some changes on my public profile account but didn't post anything yet. I'm wondering how much marketers are paying for my Full member account registered on 2012 with 100 merit ?
I would appreciate anyone helping me recover my account, cannot remember if I associated some address with my wallet back then.Any ideas?

you might be true, here is an example of a Legendary Member still waiting for more than a year without any reply:

Thanks, I already searched all my emails related to the received PM's (not sent).
However I was able to find a public post which I traded with an address that I'm able to prove ownership (the hacker forgot deleting that one). I  already done my part by contacting Cyrus, now I need to wait until he restores it.
No idea how long it gonna take, if after 2 weeks I don't get reply I gonna contact Theymos + make pressure on the forums I guess.

I want to let you know that we started a petition to DX.com asking for accepting Bitcoin as a payment method. If you agree, please sign this petition below:
If you like the idea, also can comment on their forums:
I'm sure that if we reach a considerable amount of claims demanding for it adoption.. They 're going to be forced to look at it.
Please feel free to SHARE to your friends. Ask them to sign too. The much action we take, the better..
