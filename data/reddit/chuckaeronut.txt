Basically, it's a bot that scans the comments on various sites (started with Reddit), and you can deposit bitcoin to it to credit your account with it. 
Then, all the different accounts exchange bitcoins by tipping, and when you want out, you withdraw your bitcoin balance back to your own Bitcoin address.

I very much understand that - in order to multiply, I'd convert to a really high precision floating point number, multiply by the exchange rate, and then go back to integer. I doubt I'd come up with errors that compound through eternity that way.
Another alternative would be to just use long integers to represent the string of decimal digits, and have each number actually be a type that also associates itself with another integer representing the number of multiples of 10 you'd need to multiply by to get the decimal point in the right spot. Then, multiplying would be easy again, and guaranteed never to mess up.

It's not counterfeiting in the traditional sense, in which I give you a counterfeit hundred dollar bill, and you go on your merry way thinking you have 100 bucks.
A double spend is when I give you a hundred dollar bill and then reverse history so it's like I never gave you that bill. You don't get to keep the money.
The money supply (meaning the supply of bills, counterfeit or otherwise) doesn't increase. It's impossible to counterfeit bitcoins, because the most that can be done with a 51% attack is revoke them at some point after they've been sent.

There's a pretty serious misconception in this thread about what a double-spend actually is. I can't send the money to you, and then send the same money to someone else and have both people end up with the money. A successful double-spend attack is like me sending you some money, saying "HA, JUST KIDDING" and taking it back. If I successfully double-spend against you, you don't get the money. I do. No money was ever duplicated.
In the same way in which putting a piece of tape or a string on a dollar bill and fooling a vending machine into giving you a soda doesn't expand the money supply, double-spending a bitcoin does not increase the supply of bitcoins.

I would suggest that the answer is to have both seller and buy include some extra collateral in the transaction that will be sent back to themselves when the transaction is complete, regardless of where the actual funds involved in the purchase go.
With skin in the game, seller and buyer will work hard, even with each other, to get their own collateral back.
This amount could be suggested by software, adjusted, and then agreed upon by seller and buyer. A high enough value here will provide plenty of disincentive to try to scam -- it'll literally make it unprofitable, because you irreversibly spent some of your real, hard-earned money in order to have a transaction "fail" to get a "free" item.

So, I'm still pretty new, too. My security situation is much better than yours (and much better than most), but still not perfect. I think it's a good blend, but I'm going to tighten it down a little further soon.
I use Electrum ( which allows you to generate an unlimited number of addresses from a single seed, expressed as a set of 12 words. This way, I can have the coins on my computer and watch and spend them, but if I ever lose my wallet file, I can always just restore it from the 12 words, which I have written down in a few very secret locations, as well as saved in a text file in an encrypted disk image, which I have uploaded to various cloud services. The encryption password is long, but memorable to me. No one will ever guess it, but it's pretty much impossible for me to forget. I think that's more secure than a paper wallet, because there's practically no way I could lose access to ALL of those locations where my 12-word seed is stored/saved. For example, with a single paper wallet address, if you bury the slip of paper in your back yard and forget where you buried it, your money is gone.
Seeing the recent posts about malware on people's computers is now prompting me, however, to set up a permanently-offline computer to install Electrum on, set up a wallet there where the 12-word seed and associated private keys never see a connection to the internet, and use that computer to author transactions in case I want to send coin somewhere. This will be a pain in the butt, but it will be worth it to avoid keyloggers potentially revealing the passwords with which I have encrypted my wallet and seed.
Sorry if I sounded harsh in my last post to you. It just amazed me that your solution to avoiding exchange sketchiness was to move your funds to a different exchange. So glad you're working on controlling your own keys now!!

Personal. Seriously, there has been zero issue. At one point, I withdrew $12,000 cash, brought it *in my pocket* to the post office down the street, and bought 12 money orders to send overnight to CampBX. When I sold (via Coinbase) 28 of the bitcoins bought with those dollars and put $25K back into my account, Chase never said a word. Of course, to get that much cash (which was very stupid regardless of that it was worth it), I had to fill out the government's little "over 10K" form, but that was it. I even excitedly told the tellers I was buying bitcoin because it was going to go up like crazy. This was October and November. Since then I've gone in and out of my bank account a few times with $7K, once over $10K. Never a word.

In an attempt to understand you, I remove your "neither a formal nor informal" modifier and simplify your reply to, "Do you not realize that satisfying Godwin's law is not a fallacy?"
I extract from it a proposition, which states that "satisfying Godwin's law is not a fallacy."
I have no idea what this means. A fallacy is a belief or an idea that isn't true. "Satisfying Godwin's law," on the other hand, is an action. Satisfying Godwin's law can never be a fallacy, because it's not a belief.
Are you saying that the idea that Godwin's law legitimately ends an Internet debate is not a fallacy? If so, you're saying that one is correct in believing that invoking Godwin's law does indeed end a debate.
Since you were the one who invoked the law, you have no incentive to try to convince me of that. After all, you'd rather defend yourself than tell me I'm right, and the tone of your sentence suggests that you *don't* believe I'm right.

Bitcoin doesn't inflate, meaning that while you don't get interest, the value of your holding isn't diluted by additional BTC being issued in the long run. This isn't true right now, because BTC is still being mined at a significant rate. But, it will become more and more true as the mining rewards drop off in a predictable and controlled manner. Meanwhile, the supply of dollars in the world has more than quadrupled since 2008.

Hey there, you have a flawed understanding of what it means to double spend. Double spending does not duplicate your coin, leaving both you and the person with whom you spent it *each* in possession of the amount you spent. To double spend means to "spend it again," or, to send out a transaction that spends the same coins as a previous one. As long as the first transaction remains unconfirmed (not in a block), the second transaction will compete with it for confirmation. Only one of the two transactions will win, because whichever ends up getting confirmation will invalidate the other.
This does not increase the money supply. A successful double-spend attack allows the attacker to send coins back to him/herself, after having successfully convinced some other party that he/she was actually sending the coins to them.
If I double spend against you, I act like I'm buying some good or service from you, send you some bitcoin, and then also send that same bitcoin back to myself. You will have thought you were going to receive bitcoin, but there's a chance that your transaction never gets confirmed, and eventually gets rejected.
Having 51% of the network's mining power allows an attacking party to double-spend even coins that have been confirmed, because they can add blocks to a secret, private version of blockchain faster than the rest of the network (the good guys) can. Because their secret blockchain is longer than the real public one, it will be taken as truth by the rest of the network when they release/reveal it to the other nodes. This means that if they sent a transaction to someone and received whatever they got in exchange for the bitcoins they spent, they can undo that transaction at some point in the future.
This cannot increase the money supply to infinity, because it's like the original receiver of the coins was never sent them in the first place.

The time scale on which the difficulty is meaningfully increasing is much larger than the difference in time between rewards on GHash or a smaller pool. Also, the difficulty does not continually increase, but stays constant for a couple weeks before changing.

The reason a bitcoin transaction is a taxable event is that bitcoin's value floats against the dollar. The dollar doesn't float against itself. When you exchange bitcoin for anything (dollars included), and the market value of the coin is different than what you paid to get it (meaning, different than your cost basis), it's a taxable event. If the value is less than what you paid, you get to write off the difference (up to $3,000 for the year) against your taxable income. If it's more than what you paid, you have to add the gain to your taxable income.

You buy 1 BTC for 1k. You sell it for $9k. You now owe taxes on $8k worth of gains, which, in California, is just about half (for easy math).
So you pay your $4k tax bill. You now have $5k to your name. You can’t afford to buy back more than $5k of BTC.
Meaning if you buy back at any price higher than $5k, you have *fewer BTC than you started with*.
Considering how hard it is to consistently simply trade in a manner that increases your holdings, it seems impossible to be able to guarantee for oneself that one can capture the ~35% to ~50% falling knife that would be required depending on your jurisdiction in order to buy back *ALL* your BTC *and* have some profits left over after taxes.
Because of that, I can’t see how people aren’t paralyzed into just holding.

I did exactly what you described over the top and down the pop of the late 2013 bubble, and vowed that I would sell at some ATHs instead on the next bubble. I ended up selling it all at the bottom in 2015 and bought back in (much less at triple the price) in 2016.
True to form, I sold 2/3 of my stash at $2500 after the $3,000 top in June 2017. It looked like it was gonna fail, with that crazy flag of doom. It eventually broke down to $17-1800; I was right about there being a drop. I ended up buying back in at $2,500 again once I realized that wasn’t the crash to end the party. This round trip triggered a ton of tax. Yeah in a very bad way, lol. I have coughed it up.
Because I had the experience of owing a lot of tax due to sell-then-buying partway up the bubble, I vowed to only sell the top. When we were at $17-19k, folks were talking about $25-40k. Is it the top? At every top prior to there (3k, 5k, 7.5k, 11k), Bitcoin roared right past out of the drops and continued to new highs. Hamstrung, I knew that if I sold and bought back at any higher than just about HALF the price, I’d have fewer BTC than I started with, and no cash left after paying taxes on the gains.
So I didn’t sell. Have made not a single crypto transaction in 2018. Watching 20k to 6k and all the fluctuation in between has been a lesson in hindsight and patience. If I sold now, even at 10x my initial buy price (~$700), I’d only have about 3x my initial investment after paying taxes again. Simply due to that round trip.
My new advice to myself is “only ever sell if you’re sure you really truly want out.” Combined with other new advice, “make sure that you want out, get out, and *stay* out once things get seriously bonkers.” The only question, again, is what looks like serious bonkerdom. I thought $3k in June ‘17 was bonkers, considering how long we spent under $400. The sheer ability of Bitcoin to thwart the most careful plans in its unpredictability makes me want to just throw my hands up in frustration, and hold on for the wild ride. In 2018 so far, ouch, but I still believe.
@_date: 2017-01-05 03:59:32
I agree with you; cryptographic proof is irrefutable. But, what I've never wrapped my head around fully are these points:
1. There's no reason an exchange should have to maintain your account balance exactly in any address (or group of addresses) on the blockchain. For example, three users each with 1 BTC to their names could be backed by one exchange-owned address with 3 BTC on it. Also, moving coins around on-chain would generate lots of unnecessary fees for the exchange, even if this were throttled to daily or weekly intervals.
2. If the auditing is done on an individual basis, there's nothing to stop the exchange from displaying the same 1 BTC address to many different users, each of whom has 1 BTC in their account balance. There's no way to know that the address(es) the exchange shows you is/are unique to your account.
That'd suggest that a full audit can only be done by an independent examiner privy to every exchange account's balance, who can then verify that the exchange's hot and cold wallet amounts meet or exceed the sum of the account balances.
That independent examiner would not be you or me, which, again, places us back into the position of having to trust someone.
So, please fill me in.... how do exchanges provide cryptographic proof to their users without blowing up the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-08-02 00:07:54
Hrm. I always wondered: do nodes always go for the longest chain (i.e. most blocks)? Or is each block weighted by the difficulty (i.e. most proven work)?
If it's the latter, and nodes in fact go for the longest proof of work, then this attack won't work.

Bought at 290 before the late 2013 run-up. Sold everything at 1000 on the first China ban news and realized a huge short term capital gain, but really patted myself on the back. That hurt that tax year. Bought it all back at 940 (tippy top of the dead cat bounce) and held down to 240, sold it all again to buy something else. Lost everything I gained and then a little bit more. Been scaling back in, but I only have 2/3 as much coin as I used to and my basis is at ~650. Want to get back there, but damn, that's a lot of hurt and I don't want to overdo it.

It’s not a security. It doesn’t represent ownership in any particular entity. One owns the bitcoin units themselves, as one would own a quantity of a very special liquid of which there is a provably finite supply in the universe.
As such, it tends to be treated as a commodity. I’m reasonably sure the SEC sees it this way as well.
@_date: 2019-08-24 02:23:05
Think of Bitcoin like you'd think of a finite supply of water. To make the analogy more specific, think of 1 BTC as one liter of water. So, the entire monetary supply is 21 megaliters (21 million liters).
Right now, Bitcoin-the-software has the ability to express and transact in quantities down to one one-hundred-millionth (0.00000001 or 1e-8) of one BTC. This unit has been collectively coined the “satoshi,” after Bitcoin’s anonymous author(s) who bore the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto.” This would be tantamount to the smallest indivisible amount of water (one H2O molecule) taking up ten nanoliters of space.
A change to the software could make it possible to express smaller quantities to allow more-finely-specifiable amounts. If the smallest indivisible unit were shrunk to be one nanoliter of water (or one billionth of a bitcoin), then the quantity of water that everyone owns would be unchanged, but suddenly could be divided more specifically into finer amounts.
In reality, changing the denomination for additional divisibility beyond the satoshi will likely never be necessary. Since the smallest expressible fraction of a bitcoin (called the satoshi) is one 100,000,000th of 1 BTC and there are 21,000,000 BTC that will ever be issued by the protocol, there are in fact 2,100,000,000,000,000,000 (2.1 x 10^18, or 2.1 quintillion) discrete spendable units in the system. This is much more than all the [dollars]( in the world, for example. There are about 15 trillion dollars, divisible only into cents. This makes 1,500,000,000,000,000 (1.5 x 10^15, just 1.5 quadrillion) spendable units in the dollar system. Despite being less than 1/1,000th as divisible as the total supply of bitcoin, the comparative lack of divisibility of dollars does nothing to retard global trade at this point, much of which occurs in dollars. And it's not even close... literally a factor of over a thousand.
Bitcoin holders could lose their private keys for over 99.9 percent of all the bitcoin that will ever be issued, and the remaining supply of spendable bitcoin would still be slightly more divisible than the current M2 money supply of US dollars is today. I could see BTC losses getting to be this extreme over a *very* long period of time, but, assuming the network (i.e. our civilization) lasts long enough, that staggering level of BTC misplacement would be a great many lifetimes away.

Would it not be something more like:


Each combined transaction just consumes coins from a bunch of different inputs and drops them onto various outputs in new amounts. The whole point of joining them is to obscure that 10 coins went from 1 to 2, for example. Address 2 receives 10 coins, but whose?
@_date: 2018-06-11 16:17:37
Even though bitcoin won’t technically hit its cap for that long, it’s inflation rate will drop, in practice, to basically zero after just another couple halvings. BTC asymptotically approaches a constant supply. The perma-inflation coins may slow down a bit, but they keep inflating forever.

Because of the two-week difficulty adjustments, the cost to produce 1BTC always trends toward just far enough below what the price of BTC is that nobody new wants to mine and nobody currently mining wants to stop.
The reason the cost to produce might be 7.5k now is because the price has been hovering between 8k and ~13k for the last few months, with the price-to-marginal-mining-cost gap accounted for by the need for miners to obtain and maintain their hardware as well as be incentivized with a profit.

Even though Lightning is a big privacy improvement over direct on-chain Bitcoin transactions, Monero is still way more private than Lightning. Any Lightning node you open a channel with knows your BTC address and where on the chain any of your funding came from. Moreover, any time you close a channel and claim your BTC, once you go spend that BTC with another merchant who knows who you are, all your activity on the Lightning channel could be forcibly discovered (from the party on the other end) if a sufficiently powerful entity were to look into you.

This would lead me to ask: what if a malicious actor wants to publish an old state of the payment channel, but does so only after disabling the victim's node somehow, whether by denial-of-service or some other vulnerability? It sounds like if your node isn't online, you are vulnerable to having old states published and settled on chain.
I guess this matters in practice: how long is the delay?

I like to do this, because I get to control exactly when I buy. Also, when I do, the transaction is only subject to GDAX's much-lower maker-taker fees instead of the 1 or 1.5% or whatever Coinbase charges.
However, if you haven't deposited any fiat currency to GDAX and don't have a balance there, and you think the price is rising extraordinarily quickly, buying through Coinbase's conventional UI is a way to buy immediately for today's price if you're willing to eat the larger fee.

As cool as this would be, a self-owned car is still a car. it's not a human, and it can't stick up for itself like one. What's to stop unscrupulous, dishonest humans from taking the car's bitcoins without providing the requisite services?

Reality is, this is way, way far out if it'll ever be possible.

SegWit works smarter in that by fixing transaction malleability, it enables various second-layer technologies (read: Lightning Network) which should enable your coffee transactions and even your micropayments with a lot of security, but without needing to settle every single satoshi on the blockchain the minute it happens.
To my knowledge, SegWit also fixes a performance issue wherein there's a quadratic algorithm somewhere with regard to verifying transactions: it's possible to craft a transaction that can make a 2MB block take many minutes to verify. However, at 1MB blocks, the worst-case runtime is perfectly acceptable. This attack could bring the network to its knees if we simply bumped to 2MB without SegWit (or some standalone fix for this issue).
I'll agree that without the Lightning Network and other new techs that can be built once transaction malleability is fixed, SegWit is mostly harder-not-smarter. But it lays the groundwork for future development while slaying hordes of bugs in the process.
I agree that even once SegWit is activated, we'll need a block size increase at some point simply due to how many payment channels will be opening and closing. But that's a *very* long way off. Regardless, going much past 1MB requires SegWit due to the quadratic runtime fix anyway.
There are a lot of smarts in SegWit. Hopefully what I've said makes sense!

I'm gonna approximate: Satoshi has a million BTC. You wanted "000000000001%" of this. I'm going to assume you forgot a decimal point after the first "0" and meant "0.00000000001%" instead. This is 10^-11 percent, or 1 / 10^13th. He has 10^6 times 10^8, or 10^14 satoshis. 10^14 / 10^13 is 10.
You want 10 satoshis from Satoshi.

If nobody is willing to give you what you gave up in order to acquire your stash, then you've already lost the value and the damage is done.
You're right that in most cases it's prudent to hold on if you believe in a recovery, simply due to the impossibility of predictably timing the market.
But to say you haven't lost if you pay $X for Y and then the price of Y goes to zero seriously reads to me like crazy fundies holding on for dear life to their belief that Buddy Christ is still coming back Real Soon Now™ to save them from all the people who can see that they're crazy.

Your numbers don't seem right to me. The witness data is counted as 1/4th the "weight" (i.e. effective size) as the rest of the transaction, so SegWit effectively allows a transaction to carry 4 times the amount of witness data without counting any more against the 1MB block size limit.
But the witness data is not the whole transaction, meaning blocks could never be 4MB. The way I understand it, most full blocks will be around 1.7 to 2.2 MB with the possibility of specially-crafted-to-be-inefficient blocks reaching into the high 3 MB range if a miner feels the inescapable urge to bloat the blockchain at a financial loss to himself.
Also, it's not like SegWit transactions consist of substantially more actual data to express the same "address A -&gt; address B &amp; address C" semantics on the ledger, so I don't see where you're getting the idea that 4MB worth of SegWit transactions would only be 1.7MB were they expressed in the current, pre-SegWit format.
As you and other readers can likely surmise, my understanding isn't 100% crystal clear, but I do believe that at least what I think I know is correct. Would love for you or others to fix that if I'm wrong, but you'll need good answers that I'll go and verify (just because of how much FUD and misinformation is being spread these days). Cheers!

Did you make sure the receiving address in your wallet is the same as the address to which you sent the coins? If you see the transaction and the correct address on blockchain.info, then the coins are there, and the problem is likely with your wallet or app.

You bet!! I'm glad to have been able to help someone out. I feel like I'm starting to gain a pretty good understanding of how this all works, even if I'd be personally incapable of writing some of the encryption techniques people are using to make creative wallet/transaction solutions, etc.
I've been lurking and reading everything posted here since early May (right after the April crash) and I finally bought some BTC a little while ago and just put them in a deterministic wallet (meaning everything is recoverable from a seed you can write down, so you don't need to back up a wallet.dat file or anything for that matter!).
To store and send Bitcoin, you need an **address**. The address is calculated from the **public key**, which in turn is calculated from the **private key**.
Normally, a wallet in the traditional sense is a file that contains all the information for many addresses, whereas a "paper wallet" is only one address / private key pair. A wallet.dat file contains information for a whole bunch of addresses, which is why you need to back them up frequently. If you're using a new address for each transaction, as you should, then you'll be generating lots of new private keys and addresses that you'll need to save to be able to retain access to the funds in those addresses.
With a deterministic wallet, you can generate a ("nearly") infinite number of private keys by hashing a single initial passphrase or seed. That way, you can keep creating addresses ad infinitum without having to back up a wallet file -- as long as you have the seed, you can regenerate (from scratch!) every address and key you've ever used on a new machine. Write the seed down and KEEP IT SAFE, and you'll never lose your funds to computer problems, ever.
My solution (I'm a Mac user) has been to both keep a paper copy of the seed and to also create an encrypted DMG (disk image) to contain a .txt with the seed in it. I store the encrypted DMG on all my drives and uploaded it to a couple cloud services, so no matter what, I think I'm pretty darn good to go as far as security and recoverability go. After doing the research and reading to know what to do, it took about 5 minutes to set it all up :-).

I see what you did there, and I like it...
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:12:05
Yep. All private keys and addresses can be generated from the seed. It's awesome. You don't have to back up your wallet file at all, unless you care about various labels you applied to transactions or addresses. Your funds are safe if you have / know your seed.
However, if you ever import another address into your wallet, it won't be part of the chain of addresses that is generated from the seed, so if you lose your wallet file, you'll lose those addresses. I don't keep funds in any imported addresses for this reason. Not a huge deal, but I don't like having to care.
Another thing is that you should never ever expose any one of your private keys for any of the addresses created in your Electrum wallet, because you can calculate all the other private keys and addresses from any one of those keys. So, for example, you should never use Mt. Gox's "Redeem private key" function. Always perform an actual transaction to another address in order to keep your private keys private.

Trust me, do not attempt to do this. The person who says you'll make 0.01 BTC per day is correct, but only at the current difficulty, which is increasing exponentially and rapidly.

I understand your point, but for some people without a sizable buffer of savings to fall back on, losses are far more unacceptable than gains are beneficial. If I need to make rent for $500 and pay my electric bill for $50 and I have $580 in the bank, it may not be worth it to expose myself to the risk of not being able to make ends meet for the possible benefit of Bitcoin rising. While gaining $100 would be nice, losing $100 would absolutely ruin my day.
