Irrelevant to my interest, please focus on the questions listed, I'm flat broke so I couldn't afford a Wal-Mart sized store loading center full of ASIC chips just stacked on racks in every row to mine for me.
I have to do all of this myself to get started, when I say I'm flat broke, I mean it literally, I have no income and absolutely not even a single penny to my name!

It's real clear who the pathetic loser here is, you've got nothing better to do with your time that you just sit there wasting your life away trolling for amusement looking for a rise out of the people you're trying to incite anger in. All you did was manage to make me laugh, so, thank you for the comedy! :)
Hey, if anything you're one hell of a stand-up comedian!

Thanks, and I appreciate the information.
One last thing, that link you provided isn't in the side bar, is it accurate?

15 cents per day is better to me than making absolutely nothing.

Wow, idk what that was but apparently I got 50cents in bitcoins. Thank you!

So is ASIC chips generally meant to lessen the problems of electricity or something?
If so, it'll be the first thing I buy with Bitcoins to be perfectly honest, I have no where else to turn as I have absolutely no way shape or form of income.
Dropping out of highschool 7 years ago was the worst decision I ever made and between then and now, even McDonalds and other fast-food places, not even Wal-Mart will hire me without a GED in my state.
It completely sucks, especially since I don't even have a reliable means of transportation into town to take GED classes, and I have no money to take the classes online.
edit: This is the place I turned to because, basically, a porn-star suggested to me to "channel my inner-hustler" and to start getting creative and doing something. So, this is the thing I turned to since I don't know what else to do. lol People might think I've sunk rather low to be taking advice from a porn star, but it seems like very sound advice to me.

Thanks, that's more helpful than I've had my entire life so far.

Yes, thank you very much.
