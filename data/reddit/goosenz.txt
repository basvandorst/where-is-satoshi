Oh ok cool. Thanks for a sensible answer. Apparently it’s asked a lot. I’ll take a search around

Oh right but there’s only going to be like 21 million of them or something isn’t there? Sorry for my ignorance

Oh ok cool. Yeah I just having a bit of a google around and that seems to be what they all say. Thanks.

Thanks I’ll have a search for the answer

Oh it’s not? I just was watching a little background video that said something along the lines of the block chain is processed on computers all round the world and that’s called mining. 
I assumed in return for doing this processing, you find the bitcoins right?

I get that for sure. Yeah I’m not on the subs that much I find all the chatter I don’t understand as well as the harsh or short responses (as demonstrated in some of these replies) intimidating. The community in general I find not real accessible. Sometimes just wanting a current response from an actual person to dumb it down. 
But yeah should have searched the sub first, I’m not saying I wasn’t being lazy :)
Thanks for clarifying too

Oh no. I’m serious. I possibly just don’t understand

I thought you lot would be able to explain it so I could understand it. Google just brings up a load of articles by financial publications which isn’t the angle I wanted. I am wondering about the technical aspects of it.
