did someone ever test that? I think it should throw a more verbose error than "IncorrectCltvExpiry" then?

Now your invoice expired, can you create a new one?

My other payments worked but that was two days ago. Maybe for now we have to periodically restart lnd.

I understand how it works technically, but how will a merchant use it in reality?
Lets say I want to offer some service on my webpage and get paid in BTC by LN.
If I open a channel to some hub, then its funded only on my side. So I can only earn as much BTC, as I spent before.
Do I have to encourage customers to open a new channel each to my node? That's a bit like (trustless) prepaid then. To rebalance the channels, my customers have to receive BTC from me (probably from other customers, because I cannot receive on my uplink channel, if I didn't spend before).
I still wonder how to bootstrap all that network and how to balance the channels.

I made one too:
No luck with sending so far... maybe receiving will work.

IncorrectCltvExpiry(expiry=515009) strange...

This guide is outdated. You don't have to mess around with dockers, LND mainnet beta is there you can just download and run it. A lot of RPC commands changed since this guide.
Make sure you have enough CPU power and memory, lnd uses much more CPU than bitcoind. (and you probably will run both on the same machine). I use 16 Vcore 32 GB VPS and it is already at its limit.
The software is still beta, but a lot of fun to play with. It would be already possible to setup a webshop receiving payments with bitcoind/lnd.
Have fun experimenting!

Use both  and 
My node can only be found on the latter, but at least it shows all my channels now. (I opened one with a typo, 16000 sat instead of 160000 :-/)
Remember the network view can be different for each node.
I intentionally open only small amount channels, you never know what will happen, it may still all crash and we have to wait for the next realease to fix it.
There are a lot of connection failures and sometimes the network DOSes parts of itself. So be carefull with big amounts, it is still in early beta.
I never tried to close a channel till now (let alone unilaterally if a node disappears) so I dont know if I will get my satoshis back. I did buy something at bitrefill though.

A quick google search revealed that could be from old nodes that use incompatible messages (testnet nodes "hacked" into mainnet).
Since we cannot source route at the moment (AFAIK), there is no way to remedy that other than open a new payment channel to bypass the defective node.

We germans love cash. You can still buy cars and houses here with cash only, which is not possible anymore in some other european countries.
Bitcoin won't replace cash (that's not its intention anyway) but it can be used for online shopping. Bank transfers here usually take up to 3 working days. Instant payment is only possible via 3rd party services (like sofortueberweisung) - you have to give them your account PIN and TAN.

I am also getting IncorrectCltvExpiry. Was your node fully synchronized when you created the invoice?

The fees are 1 satoshi per hop, I just bought a 10 Eur Amazon Voucher from bitrefill (one of the few real shops in LN) and paid 2 satoshi fee - total, not per byte (and of course the fees to open the channels).
At the moment it is just cool to play with the software, you still cannot earn a lot.
Well you can learn how to use the software and then later offer onlineshops to set up LN for them. This way you will probably earn much more then the few satoshis.
Anyway with the fees you can earn only money back that you spent before, unless someone opens a channel to your node.
But anyway go ahead and setup the node, it is a lot of fun and you will need the experience some time later for sure.
I am not sure though if it will all run on a raspi. I got a 16vCore 32 GB VPS and the bitcoind + lnd are causing this: load average: 2,01, 1,82, 1,88

That could be a bit of a problem if you are a highly connected node and route a transaction every few seconds, since your backup is outdated after each transaction. Asking the peer might not be a good idea, at least it's not as trustless as it should be. It cannot be verified if you lost your private transaction record.
I don't see how the node can be resynced without trusting the peers, because there is no global state (like in the blockchain) that can be trusted. Nodes that are not direct peers, do not even know the channel balance, only the max capacity.

You also have to balance the channels, which is not easy without AMP and loops to yourself. My node has 11 channels now, around 6-8 active at any time, 4 of them incoming.
But till now no routing transactions. It is still a bit early and people set up channels with rather small amounts to be safe. We need micropayment merchants and exchanges that payout via LN and of course AMP is desperately needed.
