Is it easy to use for non techies though?
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:08:18
By rich people you must mean early adapters who became rich, because most early investors were hardly aristocracy. Also, why don't the socialists just pick literally any other alt coin and go with that, rather than refuse to see that Bitcoin has become something other than what may have been intended to be (that's up for debate)? Why are you idiots still holding on to your cashening fantasies when the market seems to have pretty much decided on a 10/1 ratio?
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:10:39
So successful socialists become communists, thanks for clearing that up, I'll be sure to acknowledge the distinction in the future.

Why do you see buying Bitcoin as investment as some kind of problem?
@_date: 2018-09-11 20:35:24
You assume that everyone attaches their name to their BTC wallet(s). That’s not necessarily how that works.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:58:15
Please explain any *significant* difference between the two.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:24:26
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:06:54
So you want Bitcoin to be "stable"? Ok, how about it stabilized on day 1, is that what you think would be best? The price was at 10 for a penny and the market cap was $21k. In other words, if you wanted to send 21k you'd have to first purchase EVERY Bitcoin, and if you wanted to send 22k, you'd be really fucked because that many coins wouldn't even exist. Speculation and wild price movements aren't just good for Bitcoin, they are absolutely necessary. Bitcoin can't grow without "greedy capitalists" or whatever you people call them. I don't remember anything in the white paper (not that that thing matters anymore anyway) about "price stability", though I do remember the part about it being deflationary. Also, you are assuming 99% (your math) of investors intend to "cash out" when they make a certain amount of money, but you aren't taking into account the people with hot money who wish to remain under the radar and have no intention of cashing out. If you had it your way Bitcoin would be good ONLY for micro transactions and nothing else, which would be a real shame considering all of its other potential uses.
@_date: 2018-09-11 22:17:51
Not everybody uses a KYC on ramp, that’s my point. You’re doing the FUD thing.
@_date: 2018-09-26 15:50:34
Why not any other crypto?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:01:45
You do see the bit about it being deflationary, do you not? If a currency is deflationary, it will indeed gain purchasing power, and this will cause people to "invest" in, or save it rather than spend it. The only way to encourage spending the currency is through inflation. What part of this are you not getting?
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:08:06
When has this ever happened? How would they even do this?
@_date: 2018-09-12 00:14:48

What kind of retard sends $2 in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:51:36
What's wrong or "uninformed" about the decision to buy some as an investment for the kid?
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:43:43
If it's not supposed to be an investment it should have been inflationary. That would encourage people to spend it, not save it. It would also only be worth about $20 in that scenario.
@_date: 2018-08-29 04:11:27

It’s not, better to keep your mouth shut about it IRL. When people need crypto, they’ll find it.

That isn’t safe at all.
@_date: 2018-08-18 17:41:59

Are you seriously implying those are the only two use cases?
@_date: 2018-05-26 23:36:49
Obviously at some point but when it goes from 10k to 19k in a week you can expect a correction.
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:30:21
If you’re trying to be Bcash, then yes.
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:28:09

Fuck you, OP. Seriously. If your server wants Bitcoin, they’ll go out and get some. Real people in the real world work for fiat and need fiat to pay their bills, most don’t have the time to try and figure out how to import a private key. I bet you even kept a copy “just incase” your server throws it in the trash (out of frustration). You’re basically going around tipping in space money and if the poor, uneducated schmuck who served your sandwich can’t figure out how to use the space money, then fuck them! More space money for you, amirite?
You’re a true piece of shit and you make Bitcoin look like a scam.

Not any more.
@_date: 2018-10-16 07:13:03
Yes, it does. Now look at the market cap of gold, and the market cap of BTC, then add on its superior portability and so forth, and figure out what happens when the two reach equilibrium. Then add the offshore black whatever money and the drug trade and fomo from the general public and speculation. How do you think your micro transactions compete with all that?
@_date: 2018-10-31 00:06:49

@_date: 2018-10-16 06:28:21
As a store of value, you fucking idiot.
@_date: 2018-10-16 08:53:07
Yes. Bitcoin will take the place of gold and more. And gold is used as a hedge against currency devaluations, hit the books again.

What’s the difference?
@_date: 2018-10-16 04:09:10

@_date: 2018-10-16 04:10:06
I like how you use “enormous” right after “micro” like there’s no irony in that statement. What do you really think it does for bitcoin to have a bunch of pennies moving back and forth all day?
@_date: 2018-10-16 03:47:23

No, it won’t. The HODL crowd is all it will take to keep the price up. Micro transactions are for poor people, those who aren’t living hand to mouth need a store of value.

And how do you remember the PIN to your Trezor or Ledger after said stroke? Or where you hid the backups? A stroke is not a problem with brain wallets, it’s a problem with the brain. Without the latter I’d like to try to see you access any amount of crypto under any circumstance. Nice fallacy though.

We’ve seen explosions like last year 6 times already, why do you think that was the last? Also, you may hope bitcoin is adopted as a currency, but most of us don’t care as long as we have a digital store of value.
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:24:39
Drawing a parallel is not the same as presenting a straw man, look it up.
Never mind, I can see you’re a retard so I did the work for you, here you go:
“A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent”.
Now, rub those two brain cells together and ask yourself if that’s what I did.

Honest question. What’s a commie like yourself doing in a crypto sub in the first place? Bitcoin has always been about crypto anarchy, it was meant to subvert the government. If you love the government so much, what’s your interest in crypto?
@_date: 2018-11-30 17:41:36
Not wanting the government to steal your money and spend it on things they won’t tell you about is not what entitlement means. Get a dictionary ffs.
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:55:21
Gold, usb drives and cash can only be hidden so well, and all can be detected with metal detectors or dogs. Good luck going through customs with that stuff. Also, you assume the government knows who owns bitcoin. We didn’t all get it through Coinbase, some of got it anonymously as god intended.
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:31:08
Two. Too. To. Maybe somebody should stop playing smart guy all over the internet?

Why not just spend the dollars you used to buy the bitcoin? What’s the point of the extra step? This makes no sense. Sorry, but if you figured out how to buy and store BTC at $0.16, and had to buy again at $6k, you’re really not in any position to be giving anyone any kind of advice.

I see economic illiteracy is still big in these parts. Ask yourself, if you buy bitcoin, spend it at the grocery store and the store converts it back to cash to pay their bills, how does this increase the “worth” or value of bitcoin? When people buy and hold, they take coins off the market and decrease the supply, meaning there are less coins available on the market leading to a higher price. That’s how that works.
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:21:26
Gold goes down in price sometimes too. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:47:45
Ah, more bullshit. I never asked you to “promote” anything, only to explain how bitcoin not being meant to be an investment means it can not be an investment. If I stab you with a knife that was never meant to be a weapon, did I not use the knife as a weapon?

2% annual returns in a currency that loses 2% of it value every year and you owe capital gains on that. You aren’t getting a very good deal.

@_date: 2018-02-15 13:42:46
You’re right, possession is still 9/10ths of the law. How exactly do you think they can force this man to disclose his holdings (assuming he didn’t buy through Coinbase like a retard) or especially to turn over the keys?

@_date: 2018-11-22 01:42:54
You realize these differences you’re pointing out are totally arbitrary. “More uses”, “used more widely”, “people trust it more”, none of that means anything. Exactly how many uses does a thing have to have before “people will want to invest in it”. Bitcoin has a few uses, gold has a few more. What’s the difference?
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:02:48
No one has cared to attack your reasons because you don’t make any sense but here, I’ll do my best. 
1. I honestly have no idea what you are trying to say. Something about governments cracking down? Lol.
2. When the price goes down the difficulty of mining will adjust, or some miners will switch to other cryptos, so the remaining miners will indeed make enough money to make it “worth it”.
3. People will buy bitcoin if they think it will help them hide their wealth or earn them a profit, no  one will care how their gains are damaging the broader economy.
4. Complete fallacy. The blockchain has never been hacked, only some exchanges. Banks have been hacked too, you know.
5. You don’t have to spend it for it to be valuable. You also don’t seem to understand that all HODLers “use” bitcoin everyday, as a store of wealth. Just because Satoshi didn’t mean for it to be a store of value doesn’t mean that it’s not (you sound like one of those annoying Bcashers). 
6. Yes, all parabolic moves experience corrections. Tell me, since you’re so smart and know everything, how long will the dip last? What will the low be? What will the next high be? 
@_date: 2018-02-24 08:15:31

In all seriousness, browse r/moneylaundering and even r/irs, you’ll realize quickly that most of the idiots (and there are a lot, you’ll blend in fine) who buy this book can’t even pass the exam (lol), so there should be a ton of copies in circulation.

Explanation for you: people in your country want the services that taxes pay for, but many of them would happily cheat on their taxes given the chance, same as here in America.


I sincerely doubt you’re even a millionaire let alone a billionaire, so that’s pretty a insincere  thing to say. You wouldn’t lose a small fraction of what you would turn around and steal from people with actual wealth. If you really wanted to redistribute your wealth you’d start giving it away now, rather than waiting for the government to do it for you, but we both know you won’t do that. You’re simply willing to give away a little bit of money for the promise of even more of someone else’s money. Not quite as noble as you make it sound.


Ok Nostradamus, I’ll hold my breath.

What the fuck are you talking about? Prices of something dropping doesn’t necessarily equal an increase in supply (actual inflation), they can exist separately.

Apparently you’ve never read the white paper and have no idea what bitcoin is about. 


No shit Sherlock, bitcoin is a tool of freedom, something you leftist fucks will never understand.


You have right wingers in every country, your Muslim infested shithole included. Bitcoin is already global, and already in your leftist country. Just because poor people are jealous and refuse to use it doesn’t mean it can’t succeed. Why the fuck would a communist retard think he likes Bitcoin anyway? It represents everything you hate.
And save me the bit about being “insulting” just because you have “different beliefs”. Your belief is that you are entitled to my property just because I have more than you. If I don’t agree to pay your “taxes”, your belief is that police with guns should be sent to my door to “collect” said taxes.

I’m the one debating your points one at a time. You are the one insulting rather than debating (explain exactly how bitcoin won’t succeed if it can’t be taxed), I am doing both. Also, Islam is not a race, so your use of the term “racist” is incorrect and only succeeds in making that word more meaningless by the day.


Oh it’s more than that, you’re openly advocating the redistribution of wealth that you have not earned yourself. This makes you a thief, not a political activist. If I want you dead it’s because I fear being forced into slavery by some future communist regime led by the likes of you.


So redistribution of wealth is a capitalist thing now?

It’s also a deflationary store of value, which means the price will tend to increase over time, thus making bitcoin an excellent investment. How is this not obvious? How is someone who had the foresight to buy and hold bitcoin early on a “parasite”? Bitcoin is much more than Satoshi intended it be, and refusing to see what else bitcoin can be, because “muh Satoshi’s true vision” isn’t going to work out well for you in the long run;)

I made an actual argument, then suggested you sit at the kids table if you didn’t get it. That’s not an ad hominem, an ad hominem is when someone attacks your character *in place of* an argument. At best I was name calling, after actually making a point.


Who says bitcoin is just one thing? Just because Satoshi called it digital cash doesn’t mean that it’s *only that and nothing else*. That’s like saying a kitchen knife is just a kitchen knife and can’t be used as a weapon because it’s “really” a kitchen knife, not a weapon. The truth is, bitcoin is many things, and Satoshi may or may not have realized bitcoin’s full potential at the time he wrote the white paper. Later conversations with Hal Finney suggest he saw it as a store of value as well, and something to “HODL”.


You know better, that’s practically a straw man. However, gold has been used in many transactions throughout history. Speaking of history, “Gold is money, everything else is credit” -Mayer Amschel Rothschild
I would add to that that bitcoin is now money too, and probably nothing else, as bitcoin is far superior to gold and will eventually replace its monetary function.


It’s used as a store of wealth by many.


A shit load. According to the Panama papers, there is nearly $30T in global, offshore untaxed dirty money. That money can be seized from foreign banks, but not from the blockchain. That’s $30T worth of “utility” right there. Now consider regular savers around the world in various inflationary environments. They are still going to buy coffee with the local currency, but any actual savings they have they are going to want to put it somewhere out of the reach of their corrupt socialist governments and somewhere where it’s value can’t be eroded through inflation. That’s another god knows how much money worth of utility. Now consider that the market cap (all crypto) is only around $300B right now, and will obviously grow in time due the the first two reasons I just listed, and you may realize that bitcoin is the best retirement plan there is at this time. Anyone who is currently putting money into a retirement plan would do well to make the switch, now that’s some fucking utility right there. Bitcoin will allow you to retire earlier than expected.


I recognize that BCH, as a crypto, is just as good as BTC. However, the fuckery with the names seems like an attack and gets me seeing red at times. Bitcoin became something a bit different, it morphed a bit. That doesn’t mean it’s not the real bitcoin, it just means it’s a bit different than it was. According to most users, and the market cap, BCH is an alt coin.


I’m trying to get you there.


I know. Bitcoin fills all the other roles as well. It doesn’t necessarily need to be able to be used for micropayments in order to have value though. Also, I don’t know much about the LN, but it appears BTC is supporting micropayments at this time, if through a 3rd party. Ask me if I care about blockstream making a few satoshis here and there. It’s them or the miners, and I use BTC as a store of value that can occasionally act as a currency if I need it to, but I’ve never used it for coffee, don’t see the point.


I think we can both agree that bitcoin is money, I’m not even sure what you were trying to say by this.

How is that a fallacy, which one? How is it not a store of value? Does it rot, spoil, rust or otherwise go bad? The fact that it’s volatile doesn’t negate the fact that it is a store of value, gold and silver have some volatility as well, but everyone knows those are a store of value. How is bitcoin any different?
@_date: 2018-07-23 14:04:57

It wasn’t a fatal flaw for gold, why should it be a flaw for Bitcoin? If people are spending their fiat because they are incentivized by inflation (as you correctly stated) then what would be the currency for saving? Has it ever occurred to you that maybe Bitcoin is for people with savings and not the poor, and therefore no mass adoption is required for it to succeed? In that way it has certainly been successful for me and many others.

Why would you talk about Price inflation in a bitcoin thread? The two have no relation or correlation.
Per investopedia: 
Price inflation is an increase in the price of a standardized good/service or a basket of goods/services over a specific period of time (usually one year). Because the nominal amount of money *available* in an economy tends to *grow larger* every year relative to the supply of goods available for purchase, this overall demand pull tends to cause some degree of price inflation.

“Inflation” means the supply was increased. What happened to bitcoin was devaluation or loss of value due to market forces. “Price inflation” is a misnomer in this case.
