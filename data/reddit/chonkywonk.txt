What crypto currency has the majority share? As far as I know Bitcoin is the standard by which all other coins are measured.

Pretty sure they just banned ripping CD's again as well.

Where do we go from here if bitcoin is deemed to be illegal due to the potential for crime? The way I see it, if the powers that be take a good hard look at Bitcoin and decide that laundering is a threat they can either push to make the currency illegal or push for regulations in the system whereby operators are hounded constantly by the law at the detriment to the service exchanges and providers give us. What's everyone else's thoughts?

Well tough tits. Blockchain have put a £10 a week limit on purchasing Bitcoins thorough PingIt because apparently "They are running low on coins". I used the service once and was well impressed so went back in again a few days ago and the limit was on.
Fucking next to impossible to get Bitcoins in the UK easily.

Try and make a deposit and after you press the button to continue, red letters pop up above the 'Amount' box telling you of the limit. I don't think they announced it, they just did it. I find it really strange that the other deposit methods don't appear to have this limit but the PingIt option does. Surely if they are low on coins the limit should be in place for all deposit methods.

Thanks for the link. Not too many coins in my area but the ones trading have decent enough rates.
