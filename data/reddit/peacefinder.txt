All markets have rules. In this case, Apple sets the rules inside its walled garden.  Those rules have downsides, but also deliver very tangible and measurable benefits to their userbase. 
Personally I am confident that a wallet app will come to the iOS platform eventually. Just not today. I would much rather wait for an app I can have confidence in than get one immediately.

When Apple also bans the plethora of point-of-sale apps currently available for iOS, then the argument that Apple is doing this to be anticompetitive will be a lot more believable. (Partial list:

Apple is fundamentally a *hardware* company, and *always has been*. OSX was designed to sell Macs. iTunes and iOS came about to sell iPods and later iPhones, not to sell music or apps. That these produce other revenue streams for Apple is simply a bonus that allows them to make better hardware. 
As a hardware company, Apple *does not care* about Bitcoin. It's ridiculous to say that Apple is declaring war on Bitcoin, because to the extent they have any skin in the cryptocurrency game, their incentive is to support cryptocurrency in a way their users will like. Just as other payment systems currently make use of the iOS platform, one day Bitcoin will as well. 
What Apple *does* have incentive to do is weed out any apps it thinks its users can't have confidence in. Given the rumors of misrepresentation by the Blockchain app -  - it seems probable that the app was pulled for the same reasons any app gets pulled. 
People can get all up in arms about it, write overwrought articles, ~~drive up the resale value of~~ destroy iPhones, and call for boycotts all they like.  It will not change Apple's course, though it may hurry them up a wee bit. 
But hey, when Apple does what it was going to do eventually anyway and allows a Bitcoin app, it'll allow people a ton of self-congratulation for having stuck it to The Man. So it's not a total waste of effort!

*This* is what is supposed to change my mind? For heaven's sake. 
At this point a person has to assume that *any* computing device can be compromised by the NSA. The practical question to ask is, how secure is your device from everyone *else*?

More likely he'd want ALL of her Bitcoin. This could actually present a larger risk than cash, as cash can truly be stored offsite and out of reach.
