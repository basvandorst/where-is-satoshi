There are. They are called ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) and there are plenty available and more coming out.

You mean 180k vs 850k btc, or over 20%. Not exactly a pittance.

This is called arbitrage, and if it can be done effectively it drives the price to the same point on both exchanges.
The main reason it hasn't is because you can't do it just by moving BTC back and forth. You need to move fiat as well.

It's a nice gesture, but there's also no assurance that the running code on the server is the same as you just uploaded to github. 
Also, common advice in all cryptography is that the private key doesn't leave the machine it is generated on. This transmits it in clear text! Not even secured by https. 
I couldn't recommend this to anyone. Sorry.
