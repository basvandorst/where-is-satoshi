Sharing your frustrations here OP. This is a sample of market failure that people in this sub loves not to recognize.
Solving it, I feel will first require clear treatment guidelines from your local Institute of Accountants, then through lobbying local ERP providers for better native integration.

If your local accounting community is apathetic towards crypto (like mine) it takes time.

I am rather disturbed that blockchain analytics is considered a compliance requirement of regulated exchanges. If you look at the due diligence snapshot from Kraken... there are not many players out there.
If the regulators demand blockchain analytics, then the capital threshold to run exchanges will be even higher now. Think of all small regional exchanges who can't afford those.
On a more fundamental level, the longer we let this fester, the more vested interest we have to fight to purge them out. Privacy improvements to Bitcoin can't come soon enough!

Each invoice is custom, they are rarely fixed.
Invoice links shareable via email / chat / .pdfs is exactly what I'm looking for. The link should become invalid after a set number of days (e.g. 30 days) or after the invoice is paid off. The invoice itself will always be in local currency, but the link must show the current BTC rate when a client clicks it. As soon as he does, there should be a timer that changes the rate as you described.
I think you got the right idea there, understand it'll take a bit more development.

I tried playing around with BTCPayJungle. Any help for those of us without full-blown eCommerce sites but want to send good-old .pdf invoices through email? 
For example; I send someone an invoice for USD 10, payable in the next 30 days, but in the email there's a link that says "Pay now using Bitcoin", which brings them to BTCPay. The client may click that link 15 days after the email, which I'm not sure how BTCPay is handling it at the moment.

I think we are witnessing one of the largest sing-and-dance routine in financial history.
Companies in this space have to do what they do and say what they say (often antagonizing the community) so that the powers-that-are continue to allow them to operate and scale. All the while, more Bitcoin is getting into the hands of more people. That outcome is universally good.
Financial surveillance is simply incompatible with Bitcoin, but they have to make an attempt at it because if they don't, they'll get shut down.
We got to read between the lines here, what they are *really* crying out for is plausible deniability - some sort of technological upgrade that renders all their surveillance tools ineffective, despite their "best efforts".
As the community we should be cognizant of their predicament, and deliver on that plausible deniability.

This is what I'm worried about, and is probably caused of the previous SegWit debacle.
Bank's don't usually change their core banking system except once a decade. The reason has a lot less to do with momentum than it has to do with risk - no internal engineer wants his hands on the nuclear switch.
I think Bitcoin is forcing a technology cycle onto financial services handling billions of dollars that is a lot faster than they used to.
Without a corresponding rethink on how do they do back-end development, we consumers will always be waiting longer that we'd like.

2. Private companies will create blockhain version of e-currency (like tether, trueUSD etc. etc.)
3. Coin-mixing of blockchain version gets prevalent.
4. Central banks "dismayed" people keep mixing the blockchain version.
5. Central banks starts warning mixed blockchain version will be blacklisted.
6. People start dusting all legit addresses with mixed coins.
7. Fungability of e-currency get worse over time.
8. Greshams law holds true.

This has interesting implications where regulations are concerned (especially in developing countries).
The common approach right now is for governments to regulate exchanges. Often that necessitates incorporating locally, which the large exchanges are reluctant to do, reducing the choice available to consumers.
I use to be of the idea that we'll need fiat-exchanges in every country in order to acheive mass adoption. But if we can "unbundle" the business of an exchange, then the local leg of the exchange value chain can be as simple as tokenizing the local currency, i.e. make a stablecoin. Let the actual trading occur offshore.
Running an exchange is complex, running a stablecoin company is relatively simple, both on a technical level and on compliance matters.
I hope people like liquid creates loads more stablecoins, and people like you integrate them fully.

I've been thinking there may be a disconnect between the tech hubs where these services are developed and developing markets where they can do the most good.
Full decentralization while nice, is just terrible UX. Centralized services, lacks liberty and is severely border-restricted. Exchanges, brokerages, merchant processors, ATMs... these need to be developed in *every* country, many of which have severe talent shortages.
If you think Coinbase is bad, try using one of the local exchanges in Southeast Asia.
A good compromise, I believe is the franchise model (like Mcdonals). The hubs can develop the required tech stack, business processes, and marketing support, and franchisees can adopt these and tweak the offering to adhere to local regulation. Having a full time local team, just to deal with local regulators helps a lot in getting access to Bitcoin off the ground.

You are probably right, but it doesn't take much to cause a cascade.
I witnessed the Northen Rock bank run in 2007, people were lining up in front of ATMs just like this time. That caused more people to line up, which cause more people to line up.

I feel like invoices are still only half the story when it comes to merchants accepting Bitcoins as payment and keeping them. There's still the underserved (as far as I know) need for account administration afterwards.
Merchants are usually companies owned shareholders, governed by a Board Directors who delegate authorized signatories to the CEO &amp; CFO. CFOs in turn have financial controllers who process invoices from suppliers.
Most online banking suites have rather sophisticated tools to manage these (who can initiate payment, who can approve, who can see balances, who can add / revoke access, scheduled transactions etc.).
Not having these tools native in BTC is part of the reason I always convert to fiat ASAP after receiving BTC.
