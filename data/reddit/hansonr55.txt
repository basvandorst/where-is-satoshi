I want to but can't in WI.  Anyone know why that is?

It is highly unlikely, you made a typo and were still able to send coins. There is a difference between an invalid address and an incorrect address.
All bitcoin wallets/clients check if addresses are valid.
Bitcoin addresses are the PubKeyHash encoded in Base58 with a version value and a checksum. The checksum is the leftmost 32 bits of a double hash of the PubKeyHash. The format of the address is often referred to as Base58Checked in technical documents.
**Since the checksum is 32 bits the probability of entering an incorrect address that will still decode to an incorrect but valid PubKeyHash is roughly 1 in 4.3 billion.** So, on average, 4,294,967,295 out of 4,294,967,296 times a typo will produce an address that is incorrect AND invalid. When decoded the PubKeyHash will not produce the proper checksum, the error will be detected by the client/wallet, and the transaction won't be created.
**To actually lose coins to a typo you would need to produce not just any invalid address, but one that is valid but incorrect and the odds of that happening are almost zero.**
In that extremely unlikely event (1 in 4.3 billion is 10x less likely than winning the US PowerBall lottery), the transaction will be irreversible and only spendable by the person who has the private key for the incorrect address/pubkey. Given how many private keys are possible, it is almost certain that nobody ever has or ever will have that private keys and the funds will remain forever unspendable.

FYI - I received this in Feb of 2018 from the IRS:  "Bitcoins and other virtual currencies in foreign accounts are not reported on FBARs at this time but that FinCEN may require such reporting at a later date." 
I had requested guidance from fbarquestions

It was when I was using foreign exchanges to exchange forked coins for BTC. That was my question to the IRS. I had crypto in foreign accounts for minutes, do I need to file an FBAR?

I also tried using my link after verification and it showed invalid, as it should.  Still strange that the link allows for verification two years later instead of expiring.

If it's not either of those than it's just a plain ECDSA private key.

A BIP38 private key always begins with '6P'
An unencrypted bitcoin wallet import format (WIF) key always begins with '5'
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:13:06
Correct, BIP38 is the only format that is encrypted.

Each column is as follows:  
* Temperature (if supported)  
* Fanspeed (if supported)  
* **A 5 second exponentially decaying average hash rate**  
* **An all time average hash rate**  
* **An all time average hash rate based on actual accepted shares**   
* The number of accepted shares  
* The number of rejected shares  
* The number of hardware erorrs  
* The utility defines as the number of shares / minute  


diminish return performance even if the hash rate might appear better. A good
starting baseline intensity to try on dedicated miners is 9. Higher values are
there to cope with future improvements in hardware.
When I tried intensities higher than 9, my hash rate did not improve and seemed to be much less stable.  9 seemed to be the sweet spot.

Well, I couldn't get the MSI board to recognize more than 3 cards.  I ended up using an ASRock Z77 WS.  I was able to get it to recognize 6 cards and it's been mining stable since...  I did need to use the PCIe pin presence hack on 2 slots and one slot on the board is disabled...  
@_date: 2013-04-29 14:19:03
@_date: 2013-04-21 17:54:47
I have two of these cards running in:
* ASRock A55 PRO3 FM1 AMD A55 Motherboard (open box)
* A4 Processor
* 1050watt KingWin PS
* 4GB RAM had laying around
* old SATA HDD
* Win7
* I'll be adding a 3rd card once the 8 others I ordered arrive
* 1.25 GH/s at 653w (465w without third card)
Rig  will be an open rig and will be the following:
* MSI Z77A-G45 Thunderbolt LGA 1155 Intel
* 7x SAPPHIRE 100314-5L Radeon HD 6870 (5870s hopefully)
* Intel Pentium G2020 Ivy Bridge 2.9GHz
* CoolMax 1600 PS
* 7x PCIe x1 -&gt; x16 riser cables
* Free RAM that came with motherboard
* Old SATA HDD
* Win7
* Should run 2.9GH/s at ~1400w

bfg works REALLY well and it's not that complicated once you get used to it...
I've been playing around a bit more and got the cards up to 423.XMh/s by increasing the core to 960Mhz and decreasing the memory to 160Mhz.  Running cooler now as well...
@_date: 2013-04-21 23:58:51
The two cards that I'm running now in the AS Rock motherboard are directly attached.
These were ordered yesterday:
Estimated between Tue. April. 30 and Mon. May. 6

The original config came from the .conf file that bfgminer creates when you type [S] for settings and then [W] to write the config file.  Once the file is written, you can edit it however you see fit.

I did not try powered risers as I only had x1 to x16 unpowered risers.  Works great in the ASRock board.  I found this info about the MSI:  [MSI Working Slots](  
I did not try the pin presence hack on the MSI and for some reason whenever I populated the first x1, the board would not post.  
@_date: 2013-04-29 23:30:44
BTW, after doing some more reading, I decided to try dropping the intensity to 8 and noticed that I get the same speed, 420.X Mh/s, but I'm seeing far fewer rejections...
If anyone finds settings that product better results than mine with this card, please post.

I should break even on the hardware in ~75 days.  
After power costs (.11 here) it will bring in about $20 per day at current exchange rate/difficulty.
If it takes twice that long to break even, it'll still be worth it.
@_date: 2013-04-25 02:39:31
I received the rest of the cards I ordered today and 3/3 I tested were 5870s.  All show 1600 stream processors.
