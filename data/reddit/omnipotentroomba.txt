you are straight up lying. The judge said no such thing.

ahhhh ya your right, what I was was thinking was that CC's and bank accounts are a 'pull' system where anyone with the right numbers can pull money out of it, as opposed to bitcoin where you can only 'push' the transactions.

That is a great idea.

'The Law' is a completely fictitious mass delusion. Cryptocurrencies are real and tangible, while laws are an abstraction.
The choice is either to live in the delusion or outside of it. I suggest ignoring the regulations until the NYDFSPF or whatever actually shows up at your door to haul your ass off, which is incredibly unlikely IMO.

Great to see Amagi taking the lead! Always had a good experience with them.

+1 for this. Also, it would be nice to see some altcoin developers actually produce something useful enough to push cryptocurrencies forward instead of relying on Bitcoin Devs  to do the heavy lifting.

memes get old pretty quick. I was heavy into Dogecoin really early on and after a while it is just not funny anymore, at which point you realize it is an highly flawed clone of bitcoin with a picture of a dog on it.

Sort of like how the op was down voted to oblivion in this thread. Weird

The Bitcoin Foundation is a den of vipers and thieves. Always has been, and clearly always will be.

Good thing this happened to someone with a 950k lying around. If he were poor he'd rot in jail for the rest of his life.

In a world without readily available power and internet access, bitcoin could not work as intended. Also, you cannot eat bitcoins (yet).
@_date: 2014-08-15 21:25:25
Complete bullshit. Author has clearly never used bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a massive improvement over CC's or paypal on the internet. No chargebacks. No identity theft or fraud. No overdrafts. Also it is about 24x faster to complete a bitcoin transaction than a credit card one. Oh, and miniscule fees for moving your money around. 
I now buy literally everything online with bitcoin after getting the hang of it a few months ago.
The only downside is sometimes you have less money than you had yesterday, although sometimes you have more.
