And you report the gains on the sales of those assets offset by depreciation.

I mean, we need to buy another aircraft carrier. Capital gains tax means my income tax is lower. 
Until you can convince Uncle Sam that we don’t need things like tanks, I’m all for capital gains tax.

I think you’re underestimating the capacity of the government to get what they want. 
The government auctioned off 513 bitcoins that it took from people. 
That is proof of concept that they can seize the coins, one way or another. 
At the end of the day, even if the government can’t physically beat the bitcoins out of you, they’ll take everything else you own. What’s the point of having 500 bit coins when you’re living in your stepfathers basement and can’t convert the bitcoin into goods or services?

Exactly! 
If you’re doing a business only in bitcoin and don’t report your earnings because it’s “untraceable” the IRS (or your nation’s taxing authority) is going to question how you can afford to live when you are reporting no earned money. 
The concept of crypto being superior to fiat currency because you circumvent the  government is laughable. 
At the end of the day, the government will get their pound of flesh from you, blood be damned.

The government can never seize any bitcoin?
Why would they make up fantasy in this article?
