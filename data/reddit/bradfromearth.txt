Put up or shut up. I'll make it more palatable for you. $100 wager.

As an already rich person I have to say I have never know a rich associate nor myself who only wanted to get rich. In order to get rich you need to passionate about your chosen path.

This is reflected in your communication. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 00:44:37
You don't realize it but you have just brought us right back to where we started. I am not surprised. I think the longer we talk the dumber you get. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 06:00:29
Deep water? Explain that.

I don't disagree. This is speculation and that is not new. The odds of getting rich speculating are low. I am bullish on btc.

So you see it as calling me out? Did I not demonstrate my willingness to put you in your place? I might add that throughout this thread you have done just that with little help from me. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 06:14:40
I called you out. Put up or shut up. Since you won't put up or shut I'll make an exit. You lose.

I am willing to wager that I can prove this was not inherited or a gift.  How about 10,000 we can use an escrow.

Unless you wake up and win a multi state powerball wealth often comes with very high stress as well as a whole plethora of new headaches.

We don't share the same taste in "encouragement".

No comment.

I carry a gun for guys just like you.  :) 
@_date: 2014-03-29 06:12:56
You talk far too much. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 03:25:35
Please explain how my comment is pretentious. If we were talking about fat people and I said, "as a fat person...." 
@_date: 2014-03-29 14:58:49
I find it disturbing that you felt the need. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 05:15:33
I'd be willing to call you out. That's about it.

You need an attorney and estate planning. Nobody quits a job. What you have is a windfall and you should diversify fast. Think here with me. All of it is in bitcoin. Great right. No if you were a bit older you might remember AOL. good luck finding anyone still using AOL. bitcoin will not be bitcoin in the future. It will be block chain and crypto and likely very similar to bitcoin now. Bitcoin is the protocol. Now you really need to start buying hard assets. Things that last. House, undeveloped land, rental property. Get your BTC down somehow. Buying expensive things in bitcoin will not be easy. You may need to negotiate a bit. Get cash as well. As much as you can regularly. Bitcoin should be no more than 20% of your total net and that still is extreme. Invest in equities as well. Recently I bought 23 BTC and in a few months it has made 65%. Don't be afraid to reduce your BTC to 300k or less.
