I keep hearing colleagues say it's a pyramid scheme.. I just ignore them and say nothing (they don't know I'm into cryptocurrency)

I hope people reading this won't be tempted to do the same, it's a very stupid thing to do and OP was very lucky it turned out this way

Pretty sure it's not normal to have to write off 10% of your assets just for moving them from one place to another, what examples do you have of this?

Don't get me wrong, I'm glad it worked out you for you in the end!

I have verified myself with my passport on Coinbase but GDAX seems to want additional information:
I'm not a business and I don't have a driver's license.. Perhaps I just have to contact their customer service

I also liked the "1488" part of his name, totally someone who knows his way around politics

It would seem? How so, do go on

I saw Coinbase at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.
He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

I'll shit in my own mouth on webcam if BTC is worth 5k or more on December 31th 2020

I meant like shitting directly into my own mouth, I haven't quite worked out the logistics yet but there's still time enough to plan it out
