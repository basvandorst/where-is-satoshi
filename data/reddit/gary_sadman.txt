Just know the risks. There's risks in trading. There's a risk in keeping it on an exchange. There's also huge benefits to both exchange and personally owned. Just be responsible don't be a degenerate gambler, and keep your coins in your personal wallet more then the majority of the time.

@_date: 2018-01-28 02:02:55
To get around regulations, and the people using those exchanges are avoiding regulations so technically there using USDt because it fills that void in the market, most probably can't enter a proper USD in/out exchange. So all they can do is buy BTC and maybe hope to sell it in their native currency OTC.

Blockstream isn't core and there's nothing wrong with blockstream until I have empirical evidence of some major banker conspiracy (fake news). And you can't stop eventual layer two applications.


We're talking "cryptography" "network security" so yes they are. We're not talking about developing apps for Google.


Alot of devs and have history of being part of the cypher punk movement, their history will tell you more about their future actions, so far so good(not for Roger and fake satoshi tho). 
Some buying under 1k we don't actually know the truth, I assume most developers in this phase of bitcoin are millionaires, because they have insight on the tech, it's an easy guess, because they are full time core devs putting their passion first.

Well if you want to participate in the revolution of money you buy Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the break through and thee blockchain. If you want to use the tech you have to buy it. Just like computer or a telephone, if you want to be online buy it. If you want to use the blockchain, buy it.
Sorry sir you are mistaken take a few minutes to reevaluate or gimme some documentation that backs up your theory of blockchains existing without tokens. They are basically SQL databases.
Edit: alot of downvotes flying around here lol
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:50:44
Your basically going to be buying weather you like it or not. It'll be part of your retire savings plan or the underlying infastructure. It's better to just buy it now before normalization happens. People buying it right now are just bootstrapping the store of value. I've been in cryptocurrency since 2013 if you have any questions just ask. I know a ridiculous amount of information.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:08:54

They actually do, I know it sounds weird, but it's true. It has to be held till the contract expires. Bitcoin futures are cash settled so there is no physical delivery.

Never underestimate the honey badger
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:15:14
There's two different settlements when a contract expires, Cash, and physical. Bitcoin is cash settled on the CME/CBOE so there is no bitcoins actually bought on the market just contracts bouncing around until they expire at whatever the spot price is in the future. And yes someone is always holding the contract on expirey.

That's ok though. There's facts and there's facts you can twist them for your own personal pleasure but, if your on the wrong side of history that's pretty bad. 
You didn't even prove anything I said false because it's true. 
I don't know if your into bcash but even Nick Szabo called it a scam, and he's cited in the white paper. Szabo is pretty much Satoshi or one of "them"

Yeah those crypto already exist, but lack the hardend security of Bitcoin, if you want to invest in blockchain technology you invest in Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-09 20:46:28
You have to think bigger, and think of security in the blockchain being compartmentalized, as different value transactions have different risk and require different security levels. 
Bitcoins on the right path as creation of side chains and LN create networks for different value transactions but utilize one blockchain for liquidity. This is the future, one crypto won't solve the problem, but tying in liquidity and distribution of security risk to a secure blockchain will.
And investor distribution (well known for years) and exchange risk don't affect bitcoins fundmentals. Actually   if tether on bitfinex is found to be insolvent, it would push the Bitcoin price up.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:15:56
The BIP process is very consensus based and thoroughly reviewed it's the best way to implement changes, core consists of 100s of developers. If you think a 50 million investment in a company, can sway developers(from the cypher punk movement) that are at the top of their field and already multi millionaires, your mistaken, stop reading conspiracys.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:38:57
Alot of traders trade to make more BTC, the ones trading for fiat exist but there's not as much. Your basically losing money in crypto holding fiat.

I agree, apparently the real pain hasn't been felt yet. But on the other hand I think most of the pain is being redirected into the shitcoin markets. 
So bitcoiners might be on the softer side of the bear market, while the delusion of the tokenized "blockchain" economy collapses.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:51:26
I guess you don't realise how it works. 1 channel connects you to the network, like when your on Facebook and all your friends are there(I don't use it), it's all interconnected, and the value comes from the network effect.
Opening a channel is no different then sending to a new address within your own wallet.

I quite aware of what's happening, the top exchange in volume matter of fact is Bitmex, which handles majority of volume but is futures market so we don't use it as the spot price. Bitfinex follows that, and Gdax/coinbase signing up millions of accounts and month is easily the simplest explanation to the bull run we are seeing. 
When tether is "printed" it just means people are depositing USD in tethers bank account and then they create it. It's a centralized blockchain. That doesn't mean I think their audits are true. But even so like I said the best place to go if tether fails is BTC.
 And also investing in Bitcoin is investing in "blockchain". Blockchain doesn't exist with out a incentive token, and Bitcoin won't be "myspaced" because the "Facebook" will be a fork from the chain. 
Smart money in Bitcoin knows this because they understand the technology and game theory involved.
PS if you own Bitcoin you own all the future forks.

More risky investors (early adopters) have to deal with volitility but will take the price high enough to have liquidity that makes the peaks/troughs less wild.

The word free is used commonly for socialised government just we all silently agree it's paid through other means. It's a strawman rubuttal. I wouldn't consider my self socialist at all. Just basically automated industry funding a human beings education, is that a bad thing? Especially if it's a decentralized autonomous industry.
And don't give me your cheesey anti socialist lingo.

OK calm down you obviously know free = socialized. So  picky about defining what free is. Essentially I'm saying you won't know the difference between high school and a college in a decade. Since automation will takeover any "just  out of high school" jobs. They will have to tax autonomous industry which will have radically increased productivity.  The productivity would out weigh the taxation so yes there still will be incentive to grow industry.

If the market knew the amount lost it would price in greater scarcity. If someone lost 1 million bitcoins but didn't tell anyone. The market will eventually overtime adjust for the lower supply which means a higher price. Less liquidity on the market with increased demand you'll see a sharp price increase. When bitfinex was hacked 120k coins were taken off the market. That hack actually had a positive impact on the price. Same with gox. It's psychologically negative to dumb traders but fundamentally is bullish on the price.

He says it's a naturally occurring Ponzi. He also says gold is a naturally occurring Ponzi. It leaves a lot open to discussion. I have read and heard some of his interviews. He doesn't have a definite answer why he doesn't like bitcoin, he says now because of the limitations of block size. Before it was because it was a Ponzi. I'd say he's completely over looking what money is and how abstract it can be and a paradigm shift culturally from physical to non physical forms of value. 
He also believes governments rule over ultimately weather it survives or not. His 10 dollar figure did not account for dark market transactions.

It's not organic or decentralized, the rug can be pulled out right from underneath them taking out all nodes simultaneously. Sure they do their job relaying transactions, but a strong node network is where there is separation between nodes, be it actual location/distance or different entities controlling them. Larger and more separated the node network is the stronger the network and more secure and less vulnerable to attack.

I actually think, since watching bitcoin markets for a long time and talking with big traders that it actually works the opposite way you think it is.

A blockchain is defined as an immutable ledger. ETH changed it's history during it's fork. They rolled back the block chain to suit the needs of bad investors. The investors convinced (or voted who knows) Vitalik to push to roll back the block chain. In essence ETH isn't a truly immutable ledger  as it doesn't contain true events  of history and is many notches down the spectrum of what is defined as a true block chain.

I doubt they will cash out that kind of money would set off alarms when wired to there bank accounts
@_date: 2015-03-08 04:12:01
But still I'd say there's a lot more variables then transaction volume. I don't transact but I buy. The Canadian dollar is dropping significantly. Me buying bitcoin has prevented my losses in savings. I'm sure many people feel the same way.

Yeah thanks for the explanation. I don't understand the complexities of a transaction. Coinkite holds a change address as well as my original address? So I can't really do a single watchable address with mycelium?

Is the pin to open the wallet really a more secure thing? You will be giving any malmare more opportunitys to capture your pin code no? It should be an alternate pin

Too me looking at the chart its common sense. Bitcoin was growing before the bubble. The bubble only gave it more attention and more adoption. Fair prices should be above the take off point.

17k contracts is not 17k BTC. I think 1 contract = a fraction like 100 dollars or .1 
@_date: 2015-03-20 02:42:12
I think he means when smart contracts are in place it will diminish the need for policing in some areas such as scam and fraud investigations. It will also deter any people motivated to screw others over resulting in less case disputes.

I do not know where to insert that into my Mycelium wallet. Sounds simple enough but I've looked. Unless you've done it your self I'm not sure it's possible.

So all addresses after the first address is generated are related cryptically?
@_date: 2015-10-14 23:58:40
Yeah I read that. I sent .33 cents out of a multi sig wallet to its own address to test it.  I only had 7 dollars in it. And mycelium says I sent 6.66 ( the difference) coin kites says I sent .33 cents. Wierd. The 6.66 went to some address I don't own. It's been 28 confs.

Your just off track. People steal because of value and if that value translates into x amount something that is the estimated cost of damages. Your comparing supply ratio which is irrelevant. Like doing fraction math for some reason.

It really just depends where you want the power placed. In people or elected/unelected officials. Mostly unelected mind you. And that comes down to your stance politically . How your raised. Obviously the systems you have described have already been tried and failed.
@_date: 2015-02-23 15:16:22
Because bitcoin is an existing secure network. Starting with an alt has a larger chance of failure.

Amount of supply is irrelevant . its the value stolen that matters.
@_date: 2016-07-13 17:35:50
Answer is yes. You will see the exchanges reflect the devaluation and you'll be safe from the effects of devaluation of your home currency. I saw that with the Canadian dollar in the last 3 years. Went from on par with USD when I bought BTC, now CAD is worth 30% less one BTC = 850 CAD.

Explain what money is first. If you can do that then they will understand Bitcoin. Most people that can grasp Bitcoin easily understand the history of money and philosophy of money.
