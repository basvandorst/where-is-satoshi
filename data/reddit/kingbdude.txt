I think that's a great resource for learning the trends and types of candlesticks, but I don't think I saw anything about the tools in Bistamp's trade view like Accumulative Swing Index, or ADX/DMS. I think it has to do more with the view of the charts?

Actually PAYPAL is forcing me to use PayPal. Tried to buy some nice cologne off eBay yesterday and only option is- whaddaya know, PayPal! Not only that, but they would absolutely NOT allow me to pay with any of my linked cards because there was ample balance left in my PayPal account, which I was saving to pay the final value fee from selling on eBay (once it is invoiced). With that, I was not allowed to add any more money to my PayPal account until I scan and send them my Social Security card.
Essentially, they forced me to screw myself if I wanted to spend money through PayPal. Seriously. Fuck those guys.

Fiat, I figure a qr code and the address would work well enough for BTC

Thanks for sharing, sorry to hear how much you had lost. I can relate to this somewhat as I am 20 and new to crypto currency trading. I put $104 in Vircurex and converted to bit coin and converted to litecoin at BTC-e. I was beginning to understand trading and investing, and make a couple dollars on top of what I had after transaction fees. Thinking LTC really was going "to the moon" I bought in at the last major spike at $42.
Now I'm in the same boat, watching bitcoinwisdom show me candlesticks lower than $18 and losing 60% of my initial investment. I may as well just hold and see what happens. When I have more excess money, I will absolutely buy more LTC at this low of a price for a longer hold
