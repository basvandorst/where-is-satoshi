I'm guessing they traded.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:55:23
No doubt. It also has to do with a lot of the volatility investors selling en masse.

Multiple will be in use simultaneously. The blockchain adapts to many use cases.

Watch the market and pucker up! Seriously though, it's likely just a temporary dip before it stabilizes 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:51:56
Ah yes, the fear stage has arrived. I should've sold when it was $17,200/BtC. Fuck.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:03:32
No but it's definitely not recommended to buy when the price is that high. The price will likely go back up in these next weeks. Just be a little patient.

Haha ye it clicked a few minutes later, should have deleted the comment

Bitcoin will fail because of the ridiculous transaction fees and processing time. Also, why would the government adopt Bitcoin specifically and not just make their own when the blockchain technology improves? I really don't understand why people think that Bitcoin will be around in 10 years. There's no incentive for any government to adopt bitcoin. It's too overvalued.
@_date: 2018-09-19 18:15:32
Why do you think that? Bitcoin is locked in at 7 transactions per minute. That is not a very scalable rate. Why would you ever use a blockchain that is more expensive and slower than like every other chain?
@_date: 2018-09-20 03:38:09
True that
@_date: 2018-11-18 23:33:15
Why does mass adoption even matter? You can use the system anytime you want without MA. Besides, if Bitcoin does get MA, won't the transaction fees discourage people from using it, and instead use a different crypto?

If the dollar decreases in value it is harder to pay it back. That's called inflation. Btw I realize that money is created out of thin air too, but completely betting that your crypto will be able to cover decades of interest compounding on loans is stupid.
@_date: 2018-11-18 23:27:49
How is it a scam? 
@_date: 2018-11-18 23:40:22
Why would you want to use it day to day instead of for large transactions? You would be getting hit with fees all the time. Also, you could just use cash if you're worried about surveillance, right? Bitcoin's main chain would be super inefficient to use day to day, and it cannot change from 7 transactions/min unless you do them off chain. I dont know too much about the immutability of lightning network, so I won't speak on it's reliability long term. One more thing, there is no direct surveillance of your purchasing habits I believe. Sure, they're in a database somewhere, but nobody is watching them unless your account gets flagged. It wouldn't even be the government looking, either. It would just be your bank.

Btw, why is compounding inflation good? If it isnt I'm not sure why you've included that fact. If you're in college you can pretty much expect a job that keeps up with inflation rates. I think you're a tad disconnected from reality if you really think it's feasible for anyone to master the stock market with a small budget, work a full time job (you'd definitely need one for your theory to work,) and keep grades up. It simply isn't feasible for pretty much anyone.

Lol sorry for misinterpreting. I'm at work during a busy day atm.
@_date: 2018-02-18 21:18:32
Yeah WHAT AN IDIOT. He paid 4 YEARS OF TUITION at a prestigious university, but he did it WAY, WAY WRONG. I know because I spend all day reading comment sections on crypto currencies subreddits and judging people who paid their tuition in magic money. He should have done it my way, because I'm a genius who CANNOT be wrong. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 02:24:43
What is your background on this? Are you a professional financial adviser or are you just arguing based on ideology?
@_date: 2018-02-19 03:01:11
Yeah that's why I don't think he's an idiot unlike you. I'd say that betting on the value of Bitcoin going up and stabilizing above 20k is a *massive* and borderline reckless risk. I think he'd be better off just liquidating his profits and putting them in stocks. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 01:24:39
 Unless you get really risky and lucky at a point where you have little money to begin with, you will likely lose a lot of money. Not everyone has the time to learn how to be an expert investor in the stock market while also studying for a degree; and not everyone believes that bitcoin and other cryptos will increase in value forever. It's pretty ridiculous to believe so. Paying off your schooling asap is certainly not stupid because 99% of people would never be able to profit enough over time to sustain livable finances. I agree, if you're Warren Buffet than by all means put every dime into stocks, but that would absolutely not work unless you're a prodigy of sorts.
@_date: 2018-02-18 22:12:07
 I literally just argued the opposite. Good on him for paying off his *tuition*, not loan debt. As far as I know that is a much more worth while investment than a stupid fucking Lambo that everybody drones on about in these crypto subs. The guy that I responded to was the one who said that he should take out loans. I was being satirical.
@_date: 2018-02-19 02:21:53
That's still a pretty bad strategy for most considering that you'd need tens of thousands of initial capital. You'd also have to gamble on the possibility of your interest rate surpassing the rate of inflation, or your investment interest rate falling behind inflation. Not a good strategy for college unless you're entering later in life after knowing economics and have a lot of money saved. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:12:15
What does that have to do with my comment at all? I mean unless you have a special circumstance like the dude in the article, I guess it would be in your favor to do the strategy that the guy I replied to suggested. I had never heard of that strat before and I know a few people with professional finance backgrounds. If you honestly think that the average college student should do that then you kind of are disconnected with reality. I never said anything anywhere about getting rich either, although it is most certainly possible to get rich after paying off school in cash. Idk why you think it isn't.
@_date: 2018-02-19 03:20:53
I see what you're saying now.
@_date: 2018-12-07 05:13:22
Guys worry not. As long as there's people doing hard drugs and ordering sketchy shit from a fabled world known as the "darknet," and there isn't some weird robo cash that promises fast transactions, low fees, and ultimate privacy, then bitcoin *does* have intristic value!
