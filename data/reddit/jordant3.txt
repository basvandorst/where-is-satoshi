Yeah, I think I'll add a tag - "No*". And if people click on the company name, that will bring them to a page that explains how to spend Bitcoins to get a gift card for this store/company.

Actually, at $1000 a Bitcoin, 1 microBitcoin is $.001

Maybe. Weird because there was no news, but it is on their official G+ page.

Have that! 
(Note: I'm still in the process of adding companies. Lots more to add, obviously)
@_date: 2014-01-13 06:25:13
Thanks for the feedback! 
When you say a column for Gyft: you're saying I should add something to the "not yet"s that indicates it's possible to buy a giftcard on Gyft and then spend with that company/store? 
I will definitely implement the Coinbase/Bitpay thing. That's a great feature. Same goes for the Fortune 500 list. 
Thank you for your thoughts!

The founders of Blockchain.info probably got into Bitcoin very early. They probably mined thousands of coins. It'd be like if I won the lottery for $100,000,000 it wouldn't be THAT big of a deal for me to give $500,000 to my sister. Giving away the 10 BTC is a lot, but it gets them some good exposure and attention which is probably worth it in the end. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 06:21:08
I created a website which answers a question which is going to come up a lot over the next few years: does ____ accept Bitcoin? 
For us, it's obvious which stores and companies accept Bitcoin. However, if someone is just getting into Bitcoin, and wants to know where they can spend Bitcoins, this is a perfect tool. 
I've tried explaining Bitcoin to my friends and family, and one of the first questions I get is "where can they be used?" 
The site I created offers a simple way for people to discover major retailers and chains who accept Bitcoin. 
It's a short list now, but hopefully this year I'll be able to make a ton of updates as more and more companies begin to accept Bitcoin. 
Please spread the word. Of course, I'm open to all feedback!

I like Blockchain the best. 
I keep about .1 BTC in my online Blockchain.info, and this is used as my "Checking" account. 
The rest I store in an offline wallet, and this is my "savings account". I can see the balance from the offline wallet, but only spend with the private key. 
This gives me the best of both worlds as I have an offline and online wallet running with the same provider.

Find an exchange or ATM in Brazil and buy Bitcoins. Bring the Bitcoins to Europe on his phone or paper wallet. Then he could use localBitcoins in Europe to meet someone in person to exchange for euros. That's what I'd do.

My best advice is to watch the market a bit before you buy. If you have the funds, watch the market for a while and understand it. No need to jump right in with your funds. 
Learn as much as you can. Read as much about Bitcoin as possible. Read the Bitcoin wiki. Understand all of it. 
Learning how to secure your funds is very important if you are making a serious investment.

 is a great one. They've only released one issue, which can be downloaded as a PDF from their website. The first release is packed with great information mostly about basic stuff. Everything is explained really well. I recommend sending it to anyone who doesn't understand Bitcoin. Although it's  still a very good read for anyone.

I explained Bitcoin to my grandma today. It actually went much better than I expected. 
I explained that it's a decentralized currency, and that it's impossible to be hacked. Lower fees, speed, and easy of use (once wallet is set up). My dad sells a bunch of stuff using Paypal, so made it clear how he would save about $200 a month if he were to be paid with Bitcoin instead of Paypal, which made her a bit more interested. 
I did show her a view videos after, but she understood it fairly well even before watching.

I'm 19, and my friends also aren't very interested. Most of them brush it off and say that it offers them no benefits over cash/credit cards. 
A couple of my friends got into Bitcoin, made investment, made a lot of money, and now follow it but don't really care for it as a payment system. 
All of my friends know about Bitcoin and have a general idea about how it works, but the argument of Bitcoin being more secure and faster doesn't really do much to persuade the average college student, at least from what I have found. A lot of my friends know about it because kids at their schools use it to sell drugs. Obviously it is much more than that but that's a big reason college students know about it. I have tried to convince them to use it, but have not succeeded all that much. 
I haven't had much luck with my friends, but I do have two Bitcoin t-shirts which I wear out as much as I can. I get some looks and the occasional question. One old guy asked me what a B with a dollar sign meant, and after explaining he was actually pretty interested. 
I think sports teams and pro athletes accepting Bitcoin is what can give it a huge push and get more teens to use it. I also think the paper wallet idea is great. The average teen is good enough with technology to figure out how to load the funds from a paper wallet somewhere. Or, if you give someone $10 and eventually that becomes $100, they are obviously a lot more likely to use Bitcoin. ATMs should also encourage teens to do use Bitcoin. Especially when more stores accept it, and someone sees a Bitcoin ATM, I think the chances increase by a lot that someone will get, say, $10 in Bitcoin. 
I'm going to keep pushing it as well, attending meetups, and sporting my Bitcoin t-shirts!

So, as a 19 year old, making about $1000 a year...if I buy $1000 of Bitcoin and that turns into $50,000 four years later, I would pay no tax on that gain?
