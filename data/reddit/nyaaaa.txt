Last i checked when they announced they said something about having a partnership with a visa partner in some asian country. Not specifying anything. Also at the same time they canceled some big incentive for the token holders.
Pretty much the opposite of "looking legitimate"
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:46:36
No, it is because the company doesn't know what it is doing.
Imagine you are shopping for groceries and after you get home a driver from the store comes by and takes the groceries back to the store because you paid $0.01 too little.
It is entierly on stripe to charge the accurate amount, it is entierly on stripe to not be retarded to pay almost $5 instead of $0.09 to solve the issue in that way instead of the way that would be more beneficial for the payee, payed and processing party.
Who knows, maybe some miners were sending slightly lower payments for the last few months and stripe paid millions to process the refunds.
Retarded company policies is what people love to exploit.
Unless it is some retarded political donation laws in which that $0.09 donation would be illegal, in which case the point still remains as it is up to them to accurately charge the correct amount in the first place. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 12:14:08

Since some of your posts dont show up here ill just quote it here.
You do not know the origin of your Bitcoin, so you can not say for certain if they are related to gambling activity, are stolen or connected to other illegal activities.
So there probably is a legitimate reason for them to investigate you. You probably want to vet your customers yourself some more to protect yourself from it happening in the future.

GBTC needs to buy more btc and issue new shares to move the demand towards the general supply. (Not sure what their funds rules are tho)

So you picked something unrelated and unlike it to make a comparison?
In reality something with widespread adoption can by definition not be a threat to government because it is supposed to act for the people, which have adopted it.
If you are talking about oppressive governments, there is nothing you can do as long as they are in power.


enforcing laws isn't repressive and again you are comparing something illegal with something legal, unrelated things that are not fit for a comparison.


Have you seen the internet? There are companies that have been around for years doing exactly that.


Hell, not even thepiratebay is offline after multiple raids, court orders on ISPs, stolen domains etc. And thepiratebay  is more like blockchain.info as it only displays the transactions or hashes in this case. If the most government can do is nothing, "much more" won't go that far.
Also you have yet to name something specific that would be a "threat" to government where the only way they could fight it were to fight bitcoin.

Well, didn't you at some point create that paper wallet? So there is a transaction going to there (possibily from another wallet you own?). And the person who got it from you will at some point use it for something and create a transfer from that wallet.
So if the coins are traced to the person you sold the paperwallet to, that person can simply name you, if you weren't already identified through the incoming transactions that funded the wallet.
While the identities and the fact that the wallet changed owners might be hidden to the average person, in terms of law enforcement there is an existing trail.
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:26:54
You are aware that enforacble does not mean stoping 100% of activity? As it seems the majority of cases lie within possiblity.
You need some kind of interface where you specify to where coins should go in the end. I assume most would facilitate that thorough a website? So you could go after all of those.
If those sites are on onion or similar networks you probably would need to take it a step further.
Consider the usage illegal meaning anyone anyone using them would commit a crime, reducing the usage to those that actual commit crimes meaning all coins flowing through such a service would be linked to crimes. Meaning there is no need to know whose coins go where, as all would be relevant to investigations. And wallet software could have included blacklists so people are aware incase a stranger is sending them coins that went through one of those preventing purchases with them. 
(I guess this is all against the intended purpose of bitcoin, but would probably become reality incase of a wider adoption)
@_date: 2014-11-20 16:38:22
First go to the police file a report and get them to contact btc-e.
ic3.gov is there to go where you local police can't and find the person behind the crime. No report of a serious crime is a waste. If its more than a few $ every report is worth it.
Too few people report these serious thefts, that results in more victims. If everyone had reported their instances of theft maybe the person who stole from you would already be in jail.
If no one reports, they will continue forever.
Don't think of it as someone who stole your virtual tokens. They took your money. It is a real crime which has to be reported to real law enforcement. You wouldn't go to reddit asking for help if someone broke into your home and stole $20.000 in gold from your save......

ELI5edit: Just pointing out a reason as to why it stagnated after spiking. There are many people who saw a $50~ spike and decided to sell being unaware of the reason for the price increase. And as of now there is not enough new cash coming in as a result of the news to serve all who want to sell. People who sell do not have confidence that the price will rise. And lastly once the news spread, more people will come to the market, others will come back and people will stop selling resulting in the start of the rally. Maybe.

Companies with proper licenses from the countries they operate in. Exactly the same as someone having to create shell companies to even set up bank accounts to sell worthless marketing packages.


When you are talking about shell companies which are only set up so that the company can have a bank account, so its only reason to exist is so that the parent company can have a bank account, it is essentialy the same entity.
So there is no point to differentiate.

Ah yes, because the complex computation is instant and the second instant transaction will have priority over the first in every case. And once that second transaction is in a block your first one is invalid. Makes total sense.

All of these steps were unnessecary as Expedia has no way of knowing, same thing when your bank or credit card provider would screw up a payment.

You apparently don't recall what happened to the last pool that got too big.
Even ignoring SW and BU, pointing to ant is the wrong move from a pure percentage perspective.
So everything you write is irrelevant to what you want and is inherently counter productive to your goal.
To summarize all your other pointless replies (highlighting by me)


Bitcoin transaction processing is independent of the hash rate, you don't even understand the basics.
If the global hash power were at 0.1 TH, the exact same transactions could be processed at exactly the same rate. (obviously it needs to be powerful enough to process the transactions themself, so there is some kind of lower limit, but a single i3 would probably suffice)

There is no way to protect yourself if a non-braindead attacker can supply you with a file directly and the file requires an active connection for its primary function.
Anti-Virus software can not detect everything and it is easy to modify a file to hide it from detection algorithms.

If you want to compare someone having to QA 100 lines of code with someone having to QA 100.000 lines of code it is fine to use such terminology. And when the QA process of the 100 lines results in a worse end product with more countable and hence tangible errors, you can also call the process worse.

How many companies are actually using visa, and not a 3rd party processor? Hell even with visa the money first goes to their accounts. Not sure you know what you are talking about. 
Pick a a random processor, at best you get paid once a day, compare that to being paid a few seconds after the transaction is initiated. Not sure what system of time you use to make that fit.
The bank transfer time is the same in both cases.

There was no hard fork yet.
And as the ledger exists, the methods you want to apply to prevent it from being copied do nothing. They just make normal operation slower.
Also you are not talking about hard-forks.
As long as you create a new block and accept that block as valid and mine on top if it you have created a new chain on top of the existing block. A fork does not change old transaction and hence does not need to change anything or "rehash" them.
If they would change something that requirs that to happen, they would not be doing what you are talking about here anyway.
Also the technical part is insignificant, you need to make up enough facts, or in this case lies, to convince people to follow your cash grab.
Now talking about hard forks. You'd probably have to hard fork to make that happen... which would be weird don't you think?

As it was shapeshift, i'd just contact them and ask if they can spent the output and substract the required fee from the exchange you are getting. TBH if they have no system in place for that they should get one. With fee levels changing fast it can help a lot of users. 
give users a button to make you spent the output with a higher fee, obviously reducing the funds they get in the exchange.
You can only do CPFP if you have the key for an output, if you sent the entire output to shapeshift and have no change from the transaction you can't do it.

It sets a bad example. When it can happen to BTC it can happen to any future market leader. As such there is no reliable coin anymore.
I can't understand how people can hype this as positive thing. Even if now bitcoin cash surpasses bitcoin and becomes the market leader. What have they gained? They have proven that being the market leader means nothing. Their coin can be replaced just as fast.
Every action and reaction just reflects the lack of foresight that the movement represents. And there are enough people who only focus on the short term, so it is easy to get support.

No, normally it is that the difficulty adjusts every x(2016 for bitcoin) blocks based on the time it took compared to the time it should have taken. If you want to drop it, you have to stop mining and wait longer until you reach the block goal.
However, this is a fixed rapid reduction, that if 6 blocks take longer than x the difficulty drops by 20%. And that stays until forked out.
So now you got both. So you can use one to drop it very quickly, and ignore the other that raises it by simply repeating the previous. There is no handicap for reducing the hash rate massively as there is on other blockchains. Which would be that you won't reach the retargeting for ages.

If you use a decoder that does not use the same process to decode your key it wont work.
If both use the same method it works, otherwise not. 
Also with most wallets, you dont actually create the private key, you create a seed, which this 12 word phrase is. Based on this seed the wallet creates multiple keypairs.

@_date: 2017-08-02 09:08:28
It is more about supporting a chain that right now essentially has zero confirmed transactions, as there is enough hash power that could mine the number of existing blocks to erase all of it.
So as an exchange, if you allow withdrawls of any transaction that involved deposited BCH, you risk a direct loss. And if the volume of that potential risk reaches a certain level an attacker has an incentive to carry out such an attack.

What would that be?
The miners leaving is the potential problem you describe, the fact it takes a while for the difficulty adjust is irrelevant as the damage would have been done.
Making the adjustment downwards faster just incentivises miners to drop the difficulty by not mining and only mine the periods of low difficulty.
So what you propse enables the problem you want to prevent.

1. Unused blocks so nothing changed.
2. Can only be discarded if the network is being attacked, in which case it would be irrelevant as the network is being attacked so it changes nothing.
3. Simply false. On both sides. Not "centralized" and there are plenty of other clients. Whereas the devs from those "independent" teams work on multiple of those clients.
4. Also false as that is not the plan. Whereas the other is no plan at all.
And you are missing 5. Increased confirmation times due to low hashrate, requiring 20+ blocks for the same security a single block provides here.

Set up a mobile wallet and withdrawl a small portion to get comfortable and used to it.
When you set up a wallet you usually create a seed. You should write that down, it can be used to restore the wallet in case  you lose/uninstall etc.
It also means anyone getting that seed will have access to your coins.
Take the time to find out how to best store a seed and how to store a seed that is protected with a password (encrypted seed).
Meaning you need to input a different set of words and your password in order to get your seed words into a device.
If someone gains access to that encrypted seed it is useless to them unless they know the password. They won't even know that it is an encrypted seed and not a normal seed which simply contains no coins.

The one connected to your bank account sadly still gives you the best exchange rate.
Xapo is the only reputable company offering btc based cards. There is also tenx.tech and i think cryptopay.me, but I don't know enough about those two. So while i can't recommend them, i'd recommend you take a look for yourself.
Keep in mind that the largest fee, that debit cards that hold bitcoin, carry is the difference between the market price and the exchange rate you get when you make the transaction. And sadly neither of those 3 companies list those prices for non card holders.

There is no difference, he still stored two things that when someone else takes possesion of, results in that person controlling the bitcoin. There is zero positive change to security or anonymity through those actions.
If it is a key or a signed transaction does not change anything. It is just less secure as he now needs to preserve two pieces of information in order to control assets instead of one.

They don't settle with less. They settle for a predictable income that they chose. They set the fees the users have to pay.


As mining was never more profitable then simply buying coins, it is unlikely to be different. Unless you got the scale to cut down on the price or have facilities in china. But they charge almost $0.10 in combined power and mainteance fee per kW/h.
For most it would be cheaper then running it at home, but as barely anyone runs them at home that is not a good comparison

As the blockheights of both chains will diverge based on the supporting hashpower you can use locktime aswell should there be a large enough difference.
But as with all the methods you mentioned, they aren't something that can easily be implemented into a client that every user can use.
You could make a service that distributes satoshis from the new coinbase outputs to anyone who pays a small amount in (both coins as they arent split yet) to you. This could work in a client if a big enough miner were to make one. But we don't want to move coins into a new client for every fork.

Scroll down to the lowest graph that lists the size. 1000 KB = 1 Block see how much data is above the fee level you have paid.

The other signaling had a 95% threshold. This lowered it for an alternative activation route. The threshold is the number of blocks that signal it in a signaling period.


For the first signaling to activate segwit they have included said identifier already. 
As we have no segwit network yet a commitment to change said nonexisting thing should not be taken as accurate, as the person commiting to it has no idea what either side of that change entails.


There are almost no reasons to list, most come down to personal attacks against groups. 
While at some point the size probably has to increase, committing to an increase at a point in time where the network state is entirely unknown, as a big change is implemented prior to that, is not how changes to a production environment should be handled. And you can't test real world reaction on a testnet.
tl;dr: You can't discuss 2x before knowing how segwit performs.
And an agreement that mandates one, at a fixed time, without taking into account the changes the other could results in is just bad.

For the money you keep you should probably invest either some money in a trezor or some time to set up your own wallet anyway.
There is a small chance that you have a chrome extension designed to steal bitcoin by replacing the string. But if it stopped probably not. Doesn't hurt to check etiher way.
For the mirroring, you see the 3 larger things in the corners, they pretty much make sure the orientation is known.
And even if it would detect a different string from the code, the chance that that new string would be a valid wallet address is incredible small. For it to have happened twice in a row probably impossible.

You have a bunch of items on a table, like pieces of wood, all kinds of fruits potatos metal tokens and more. When you put a set of items into a machine, the machine gives you a number. If that number is small enough you found a block.
Now for every block you have to put a specific banana and a specific piece of wood into your machine. But there are other items you can freely modify and pick one out of thousands of variations.
And if you put just one slightly different item into the machine you get an entirely different number. You don't know what you get, just that if you put exactly the same things into the machine it will be the same again. If you change one thing, it will be different.
You basicially go through the thousand different types of potatos and once you went through them all you now switch the metal token you used to a different one and go through all the potatos again.

You can write a lenghty guide on how to to it. You don't have to keep that secret. Give it to everyone.
For the transfering part, give an encrypted seed to an attorney.
You can give the decryption key to either your relatives directly, a different attorney, or split it up among those parties.
You can also create a transaction that would transfer your assets to a certain address after 1 year unless you deactivate that transaction.
You can have the seed you give out be for that new address.
And there is an endless number of further methods that are possible.

So if you haven't paid taxes, but your lifestyle increases, it is just a matter of time before someone comes asking.
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:33:41
The fact that over half of the month the demand is lower than the supply, and hundreds of megabytes of more or less worthless transactions can be included every month indicates that while some increase is necessary, a small one can take care of the current requirements.
And as we will double the current size as you claimed above, that seems to be more than enough for the next few months.
Why do we need to double it again just 2-3 months later?
Why do we have to use such pointless blunt mechanisms when we can do it incrementally as demand develops.
When you have to convince those opposed to increasing the blocksize, why is the option you support such a thoughtless low tech hack of "double it". There are a million sophisticated ways that you can implement to adequately increase the size as demand develops. But no, the best option, after the increase block size movement is active for years, is still "double it".
I mean there is a tiny chance that the adoption will skyrocket in the months between segwit and the targeted 2x. But that is so tiny that the amount 2x increases is way too much in almost any imaginable scenario. But those scenarios exist. Yet the 2x side does not even bother to think about implications it might have.
Which you can easily see at the BCH hype train even while they have a broken difficulty system and pointless block size no one uses and is open to anyone who would like to attack it.
Which as they claim, as there are entities that want to kill bitcoin as it is, would do if they were correct with their conspiracy theories.

There is no reason to divide anything as your input set is large and diverse enough and every input has the same likelyhood of being correct as any other input. You just have to add a unique identifier to every machine and you have already divided your inputs.
And you will never solve all possible inputs. I mean there are over a septendecillion* correct answers at the current difficulty.
+- a few sexdecillions about *24.519.928.653.834.298.191.929.243.719.283.954.822.804.150.843.209.506.479 for the latest block?

There are not, there is just an different chain that is easily exploitable being mined while people still support said chain. (Over 3000 Blocks in 5 days)
At the normal blockrate all transactions that are in the mempool could have been included in the last days.


Only people who don't understand bitcoin have that position. But yes, people who have been working almost every day for close to a decade on something, understand the fundamentals less than some people who are parroting made up statements.

Neither of those is hot or cold storage.
Hot storage would be a internet connected device that makes transaction based on input from other systems.
Cold storage would be something that never touched the internet.
Electrum is a good consumer wallet.
Ledger is a hardware wallet that enables you to store and transact without worrying about the state the host device is in.

it just dropped from 0.1 BTC to 0.7 BTC while staying at 300 because BTC went up. Now enough people decided that 0.1 BTC is a fair price for them and bought bringing it back up again.

Yea, as the chain is not safe yet, any big pool could just switch their power and mine 10 blocks in a few hours to erase all existing transaction.
Not sure how people thought this would turn out. You now have a chain with the same algorithm as the biggest, always at risk of such an attack.
The point of a blockchain is exactly to not have that risk.

As there are multiple trades happening at the same time, that does not comply with the definition.




Like realizing it is worth more. Or selling it. Or looking at prices. Or filing taxes.
The scenario you describe is not a purchase, but the process where you defraud the other party, as you are aware of the actual value.
Or to be more precise, you would need to move your coin from Kraken* to another exchange and sell it there for you to have made that money.
Otherwise you would simply be owning an IOU from Kraken that promises the delivery of a coin. That IOU is worth the price on Kraken. Only when exchanged for a real coin has it the value that can be realized on other markets. As such a disconnect in price would not be without reason. As  you yourself explained, that there is an industry built to keep those similar.

No, exchanges only match buyers and sellers. What you describe would be a dealing desk.






All bitcoin and fiat are stored on the exchange at the point of the transaction and until either withdrawls anything. 
Not every site where you can buy or sell bitcoin is an exchange.
Coinbase is more of a dealing desk, but they have gdax as their own exchange so they don't really hold anything for long.
Sites like localbitcoin are just marketplaces where people find each other to transact, fiat is not stored there, sometime bitcoin are stored in escrow there.

The earliest proposed executable(released client and functioning signaling) hard fork(for bitcoin) was early 2016, so your "years ago" is a false statement.

This isn't about math. This is about a change on a network that does not exist yet.
Lets say you and me start a book store in city x. 
Two years later we see business going up. So we make a plan to buy some additional storage in the basement of our building in 4 months(segwit). This would solve our current problem. 
Yet at the same time we plan to buy the entire next store 3 months later(2x), without knowing how our first plan changes our business or what our customers reaction is.
Wouldn't it be logical to first carry out the first step and then look at the result? Why should we sign a purchase contract for 2x before we carried out the first part?
This debate is less about yes or no. It is more about the reckless way one change is pushed.
For instance, if segwit adoption is good and we aren't getting fee spikes in short high usage periods again, why would we need a instant 2x hardfork? We don't even know how much usage will go into the new capacity. So we don't even know if we are getting 1.5mb or 2mb or 3mb equivalent blocks with segwit. Or if the capacity is used.
If it stays closer to the minimum and volume doesn't move towards segwit transaction it probably is a good solution. But there is no reason to set a date for the fork before we know how the network will look in a month let alone the time of the fork.

If you scroll down to the lowest graph and move your mouse cursor all the way to the right, you can see something like this.
When you look at 160+ you see there are about 3.5 MB worth of transaction that have a fee above 160s/B.
Now if the graph is going down it means that data will get cleared as there is less demand then space at the current time, if it is going up that means there is more demand then space at that time.
It has dropped from ~10mb 3 hours ago to the current 3.5 MB, so it is possible that it will get confirmed within the next few hours, unless demand picks back up.

As mentioned the coinbase transaction is part of that. And as you are the one creating that transaction you can modify it. Even if there are no other transactions.

EDA chain will be mined until the 2016 difficulty adjust, then the other chain will get mined until the EDA chain has reduced the difficulty down agian.
As even with 700-2000% inflated hashrate the maximum increase is 300% and then rate can drop down to almost nothing within a few days. It dropped to 10% of the original rate within a few days even with blocks getting mined.
The most profitable way would be for 100% of hashrate to mine btc, wait for the other chain to drop 20% literally every EDA period, mine the remaining 2000~ blocks in one or two hours and go back to btc.


But we have already established that there won't be movements of this magnitude every time to the "most profitable" one. But as long as EDA is active on a chain it will cause such fluctuations.

It might help if you understand the issue.
Person requests withdrawl. Viabtc sends withdrawl. Person modifies hash of withdrawl transaction. Transaction with modified hash gets confirmed. Viabtc doesn't see the withdrawl they sent anymore as they apparently only monitor the transaction hash. 
And then something else can happen depending on their system.

? Viabtc resends as the system thinks the transaction was rejected since the transaction disappeared from the mempool

No. In different market situations different providers could be better, depending on price differences on certain exchanges different providers could be better. 
Which your resarch, based on those charts showed, as there is no provider that is always best, most of the time yes, but everyone except coinify was at least second best at one point, with 3 being best. (EUR)
You also did not include the fees those gateways charge the merchant, in cases the gateway charges the merchant, the margin for the consumer would obviously be lower as they already have that buffer in case of price changes. In that case the merchant might add the price on the product as happens with all fees a merchant carries in some way.
If merchants don't convert to fiat right away you also cut the risk the gateway provider carries. Your winner carries a flat 1% for all merchants on all transactions.  Bitcoinpay who was close, most of the time but has some spikes has 0.8%. So the difference is kind of already explained, now the question would be where do the spikes come in, what causes them to adjust their pricing more radical? 
Coinbase with its 0% for 1 million is pretty close most of the time and has less drastic spikes than the leader until nov 1st. Bitpay was mirroring coinbase excluding about 10 days but was consistently worse, even though they charge their 1% after 30 transactions or $1000 per month.
None of this covers different prices on different exchanges which these services might prefer and have contracts with.
A result could be that with low activity and exchange x with the highest price y would be the best gateway wheres with high activity in the market z would be superior.
If you want to call it research, don't ignore all the variables that influence the prices on those gateways.

About 30 Blocks full blocks, or 30MB, it entirely depends on the rate of new transactions during that time.

Over 40 mb are  ~1s/B transactions from a single entity and is not relevant, it just inflates the mempool size without having an impact on transactions.

As someone who claims to be into Bitcoin since 2009, not being able to tell the obvious scams and ponzis seems strange.
Also you post


In which you claim to be involved in serious crimes.
So it seems strange that all your statements can be legitimate. Why would you claim to be involved in crime, then post enough information for Chase to 100% link this reddit account to your identity?
So i dont know if you are a troll, apsiring writer, just have problems thinking straight with your hormonal issues, or just didnt think at all when making this post.
If what you wrote is true, you should probably get out and forget about those accounts or prepare to go back to jail and find a way to hide your keys.
As a writer you need to think of a coherent character and story before starting on multiple sides, if they don't match from the start you can't combine them later on.
If you are a troll you might want to post some (high quality) pictures of 1863-1870 Hong Kong stamps.

A hard fork is just an upgrade that loosens rules. For two chains to exist a large enough group has to commit to mining a different chain and find a block, if that doesn't happen the chain doesn't exist. If they find one, that would mean it has support. So for two chains to exist both will have support. If only one has support only one exists.

You paid a pretty high fee already. But like the moment you made your transaction there was a increase in usage. That continues up to now.
Today there were over 13 Blocks worth of transactions with fees below 5s/B processed already.
But in the last 30 min alone, over 5000 transactions paying over 80s/B were submitted to the mempool.
If this continues you might have to look into replace by fee. But it might subside again in the next few hours. We haven't had this level of concentrated usage in weeks.

The easiest would be to capture the click on send, replace it at that point before releasing the click. So there should be a confirmation screen where the info can't be changed.
If the transaction is modifiable in memory, whichever wallet that is shouldn't be used, as it is garbage.
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:18:32
You don't guess a result, you pick an input and look at what you get. As the result is random and unpredictable you don't have a "innitial" guess as you describe.
But most modify the inputs in the same order, so kind of they do start with the same "guess". But that guess produces a different result for every block.

Or use a different channel. But that would be logical. And it also is not "receive a total of 1" but "receive a total of 1 more than you send"


Except you choose acceptable fee levels and know the maximum cost. And also funny how they are now unpredictable when a second ago there was only one existing channel.


I don't know, probably not use a payment network designed for small and often repeated transactions in order to not have to pay a "large" fee for each of them. Have you heard of the bitcoin blockchain? Coincidentally there are only 150 transactions in the mempool that pay over 5s/B. Large fees right.


So when you use it, it is unusable?

wow, so either all those that are for it thought they would support it and hence did not talk about it, or no one wants it.
Goes at least somewhat against the "all miners are supporting it" narrative.
So you gotta reduce the signaling percentage by another 10% as the blocks still do signal.
So neither viabtc nor btc.top (another 13-15%) don't stand behind it like the narrative might want you to think.
That puts us at or below 60% with most(all?) of those 60% not having given any statement on where they stand besides the signaling flag.

So, what would you get if you use electronic currency to gain cash? 
Do you get $115 for $100 if the inflation was 15% higher? Or do you get 1-1?
I withdraw $100, get $115, pay $115, they deposit $115 and get $100 back in the bank.
So isn't it the same just a different currency? You could always buy something for that value in electronic currency and sell it for the cash currency to get that difference if above wouldn't work. How is it an "inflation rate" then? It is just a different currency with an exchange rate that gets worse over time. Or is inflation just a term used to describe themself failing?

That would be good news for bitcoin. It would mean it were a serious competitior.
(Also miners still set the limit on the blocks they mine (as you've seen in the recent "Stress Tests"), so unless those entities set up mining operation and set the block limit to 1TB, and mine blocks, and generate enough transactions to fill them, they can't do that.)

Well, on android at least to the one you use to install(playstore) and the one you use on your phone (like possible back up feature to google account). Not sure if the database file would be in a backup.
On apple devices if you do a full backup im pretty sure it would be included in it as it is more or less a disk image, so there is a possibility. (So icloud backup on?)
With the database file you can recreate the required keys.

As the value of accepting bitcoin to a small business isn't that large in terms of additional revenue, there is little you can charge without making it a bad investment for them.
Also i don't see how the process would take 20 hours. Most of the time seems to be your "first time figuring this out" which you shouldn't charge all on an individual customer. Billing a few hours should be ok.
It is you who wants them to start accepting it and not them who desperately want to start accepting it.

Almost all instances of higher fees were directly influenced by "him".
Those during the last 3 months were with maybe one exception all caused by hashrate going to mine "his" altcoin, causing fewer blocks than normal. The data that accumulated in the mempool during that time was always less than the capacity the network was reduced by, meaning essentially, without that factor, the fees would have been below 5s/B. (Not taking into account increased usage that might occur in such a situation.)
The fact that those backlogs caused by "his" actions clear very fast is proof that there is enough capacity at least for today.

Stop loss getting triggered means a market sell order is created, which results in the price going down. When the price goes down additional stop losses are hit, again creating market sells and further decreasing the price.
And as after a market going up quite quickly the buy orders haven't populated the space between the last ath and the current price, the price can drop quite quickly as there aren't many buy orders to fill those market sells.
That's why it can go down quite fast after quick rises. (Same kinda applied for the rises with shorts and mainly the empty order book part.)

Don't limit yourself to one exchange.

Simply taking the SSD out and stating there are files on it you are not allowed to hand over to third parties might be enough. They should be able to use a replacement part to test your device before giving it back to you.
Since i don't know how apple operates it might not work, but i can't think of a reason it won't. In the worst case you could just claim the ssd got stolen and pay for a new one with the repair.
Once you get it back you can just put the ssd back in.
The SSD should be fine so don't worry. And you can back up the content of the SSD to any drive under any OS, just ask a friend or use another computer if you have one.

Have you heard of exchanges? Private companies who put a system ontop of bitcoin for profit.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:43:16
On chain you have to pay a fee per byte of transaction, that varies between 1 and 200 or sometimes 1000 satoshi per byte depending on the current usage.
On exchanges you have to pay a fee depending on your order type, these vary by volume and site from zero to 0.5%(?). Any more and you should probably find another exchange. There are also sites where you directly buy, similar to bitcoin atms. These sites charge a higher fee or simply mark up the price substantially(like atms do) to claim they have no fee. 
Your country of residence might limit you as to what exchanges you may legally use, so alternatives could be limited this way.
There are also substantial fees if you use a insecure(for the exchange, risk of the transfer being reversed) way to transmit funds to an exchange, like by credit card or paypal.
Proper bank transfer can be without fees add on around 0-0.25% for the purchase and at most $2, if you are in no rush, to move it to your own wallet.
@_date: 2015-07-27 20:15:26
The 20% discount is for everyone.
There is an extra 10% if you pay with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-30 19:49:36
If the backdoor is dormant it would need to activate while connected to a device with internet connection to transmit the contained keys.
So there is no risk if you don't connect it. 
And with offline signing, you don't need to connect it. 
You can firewall it. You can log traffic and manually approve packets.
And if it starts someone will see it transmitting and alert others.
So, don't get a hardware wallet that has a wireless chip and you should be fine.

Way, WAY, less than by simply buying the coins. The only way for those contracts to pay is when the price goes up a lot. But in that case, having simply bought the coin in the first place would have made you more money.

The miner can make the fee whatever as he is paying it to himself, if he includes transactions which only he knows about.

Because you don't instantly move the stock you bought from a broker somewhere else. And even if you did, one broker could tell the other that the client failed to pay and the other broker could return ownership of the stock as reimburstment for the loss. As both parties have to abide by the same laws.
With bitcoin you gotta make sure before you hand over the coins as there is little way to get it back after. As whoever holds the coins later on has no responsibility anymore.
And looking at how bad banks are still getting ripped off by cirminals, its not easy and is guranteed to produce some false positives as you have to be more careful here.

No, the margin incrase is higher, you don't seem to understand economics.
If you had a 5% profit margin with normal mining. 
You have the same cost 100, while your income is 105, a 5% profit margin
Now you increase your "hashrate/power saving" by ~30%.
You have the same cost 100, while your income is closer to 135, or anywhere in the range of 120, 130 or 135 doesn't really matter.
Your profit margin now being 20%, 30%, or 35% means a 400%, 600% or 700% increase in the profit margin.
Not 30% increase.
Considering mining margins are always told to be incredible low, 30% more income is the difference from going out of business to going out of business because  you retire.

Title: Optimizing method, device and circuit for Hash computing chip of bitcoin proof of work
Application Number	 201510520251	Application Date	 2015.08.21
Publication Number	 105245327A	Publication Date	 2016.01.13
Classification	 H04L9/06	 
Applicant(s) Name	 BITMAIN TECHNOLOGIES LTD.	 
Inventor(s) Name	 ZHAN KETUAN;SU JIE;WU JIHAN;DUAN KAI;XU LINGCHAO	 
The invention discloses an optimizing method, device and circuit for Hash computing chip of bitcoin proof of work, and relates to the technical field of cipher computing, computer network and integrated circuits. The optimizing method comprises that a second input of the Hash computing chip is kept constant periodically, and when the second input is constant, a computing circuit corresponding to the second input is switched off; an initial first input of the Hash computing chip is changed, and a corresponding new first input is obtained; and Hash computing is carried out on each first input, the corresponding second input and a random number to search proof of work that satisfies the requirement, and each first input comprise the initial first input and the new first input. The method, device and circuit provided by the invention greatly reduce the power consumption of the circuit.

A pointless sticker does not increase security, it only increases a sense of security for the customer, which as it does not increase security only decreases the actual security.
A customer who gets a fancy package with intact stickers won't think his device has been tampered with.
And as you say, stickers are cheap, so is cardboard. You think someone who wants to tamper with hardware can't afford a few stickers and cardboard?
Why even bother to flash the firmware, a real attacker could just rip out the internals and put in his own hardware, which would be an actual threat potential.
Not some flashed firmware that gets replaced as soon as a customer gets the device. Which a customer might not consider doing if there would be some pointless stickers on it making him think everything is fine.

That is why you create keys on clean devices that are not connected to the internet. And generate transactions either from such a device or using a device that stores the key securely like trezor or ledger.
If you create a new wallet on an infected machine you will indeed leak the seed to an attacker. (A keylogger would not suffice but most malware is capable of taking screenshots)
Also access to mail or cloud should not mean access to your pc. Don't store plaintext passwords in your mails or cloud. (Also not on your pc in case an attacker does get access)

Very high.
Imagine posting your password here and simply adding 8 additional characters to it. That are very few combinations compared to what attackers usually deal with.
Just use the functionality to encrypt your seed with a password which will generate a new 12 word seed. That seed is useless unless the attacker knows the password.
If you input the 12 words of the encrypted seed and your password it will give you your original seed.
You can also encrypt the things you save to the cloud with a password in any case. Simple zip or rar or truecrypt volume etc.

But why take this pointless risk when the tools exist and are so simple.
He probably would only need to access a single e-mail account, or infect your pc.
Why would you save the seed on a device connected to the internet anyway.
Again, you are posting your password with 8 additional letters. An attacker only has to try every 12 letter combinations out of 20 existing letters.
In the other case he has to crack your password which can be as strong as you make it.

You need deposits on both exchanges at the same time.
You need fiat deposits on some exchange. 
Fiat deposits don't increase in value when bitcoin goes up. So holding bitcoin would be superior in many situations compared to attempting arbitrage.
You can't transfer fiat deposits from one exchange to another. (usdt does help here, arbitrage on usdt exchanges is hence easier, but gdax isn't one of them)
Transfering fiat to or from exchanges in other countries is very hard (china/korea).

50 hours ago you could have done that for 0.25-1s/B with next block confirmations.
The claim that "blocks are full" is just not true if there are plenty of times where the mempool is empty and others where its just chugging away at 50 blocks of 1s/B transactions.
We are at 3-4 Blocks per hour for 24 hours and there is only 40mb of data, which means 40 blocks of data in the mempool. Which at 6 blocks per hour would mean the mempool would be empty.
The only two things that have resulted in higher fees is the Bitcoin Cash EDA and delaying transactions in the time right before a hard fork.

Profit calculators usually don't take the change in difficulty into account.
Which is very significant. This is one of the better calculators 
Like with 8% monthly difficulty increase you would be doing ok.
At 15% you barely break even depending on your innitial investment. And in the last 3 months the difficulty went up by 48%, that comes down to above 15% per month.
If you are thinking about taking into account the rising price, remember that if you rely on that, simply buying the coin instead of mining equipment would be a better deal.
You also need to have the capital and the infrastructure to properly run and service devices (that is a big factor, if you just have a few and some break you are out a lot of money, thats why you need scale so servicing them is affordable)
If you pay 6 cents for power it is unlikely to be very profitable. As it would indicate you don't have the capital to source cheaper power.
If you got money to spare and are in it for the experience get one. If it won't break and the expensive hours aren't that frequent you can make some money.  But if you would be doing it soley for profit, it has its risk.

See  for current fee.
Then count with ~200-240 times the satoshi value.
If your wallet consists of many smaller inputs or you are paying to multiple destinations add around




If you are making a segwit transactions multiply by 0.25.
The dollar value the bitcoins you transact have has zero influence on your transaction fee. It will be the same* for $0.01 and $100.000.000.000
*as long as it is contained within one unspent transaction output.


Most list a static fee you have to pay when withdrawing, that covers the fee they pay for the transaction.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:00:14
You have to realize that a chain where you have to pay a fee and wait isn't the right solution for every enterprise application.
Putting every transaction on the planet into a single distributed high security ledger is something that will never work.
Just like you don't store your cash in a bank security box and visit the bank twice for every store when going grocery shopping.
Since you can't move the high value things that rely on the security, you have to move low value things.

Lets say bitcoin is at $4000, you deposit $4.000 to an exchange and buy 100 bitcoin. Now if bitcoin goes to $3990 your account balance is down to $3000. (100 bitcoin*$10) If it goes to $3970 you are down to $1000.  
To hold a leveraged position you need to have a certain percentage of margin left (like 15 or 20 or something depending on the exchange), so that in case of a rapid price move your account balance won't go into the negative. So once that percentage is hit you are forced to liquidate and the exchange will terminate your position with a market order.
So if bitcoin went down like $35 you just lost $4000.
Margin calls are what can accelerate price movements aswell.
Plenty of exchanges offer like 3-10 times leverage, i can give you links to those that offer 20 or 100 if you read up on it and are aware of the risks, not knowing what a margin call is says you are not ;)
@_date: 2017-09-22 18:59:10
The conversation is slightly below market, makes a bit sense as they have to commit to the transaction right then and there, and if they would proceed to sell large amounts it would push the price down.
But you have the option to just withdraw and exchange it yourself, so while the price is stable do that. With 20 blocks per hour confirmations should go quite fast even on the strictes exchanges.
Also 
Edit: No new block since 15 min, guess the price pressure made miners switch back to Bitcoin. 
Could be better to hit that exchange button instead of withdrawal.

Unless you provide a written statement by your "casino license issuer" that THIS specific card (supposedly used a long time ago, gift and prepaid) needs to be provided a copy of, and the fact that it was requested so long after it was used is also according to its license specifications, you should pay him immediately.

Its legit for the people who created it. Anyone else is just playing a game hoping to get paid in the end. There is no long term in such programs.
You also have to exchange your bitcoin for other tokens, so when the bitcoin prize goes up.... you gain nothing because you no longer own bitcoin.
Once new investors stop coming in, in numbers that exceed the generated paper profit, the price for the token will go down as "lenders" scram to exit. 
You will always get your percentage return on bcc tokens. But the price of those tokens will go down and the price of bitcoin seems to go up. So overall you might lose a ton of money.

Say there is a 50s/B transaction unconfirmed. New transaction spents the output from that transaction and has a 350s/B fee, so if a miner wants to include that new transaction he has to also include the previous transaction. Now if at the time 200s/B were the fee for a transaction to be included, the child transaciton is paying enough for both transacitons.

Once the "significantly priced and massive transaction" were included in blocks[1] the percentage went down. As those are not segwit transactions. And that is an indication for the overall transaction volume to be way below capacity.

They simply send the data you sent on one chain on the other chain.
Resulting in the same transaction happening there, resulting in you paying the party both types coins instead of just one.

Since she needs to buy the bitcoin in the firstplace coinbase or circle or similar are certainly the easiest choices. 
Adding another wallet inbetween is more trouble than its worth, and i doubt coinbase will close her account as she probably won't be doing the things other people get their account closed for.
But i am not sure if coinbase will honor the offer if they see someone sign up and the only action is buy exactly the requirement and then send it to the person that gets the reward.
Until now i've only read from people complaining they didn't get their ref rewards (old system tho i guess). So if any of you got it in the last few months i'd love to hear something positive :)

So you went from a specific chip to random anything.


So its first off remote nonsense?
Any app can emulate a browser and do whatever you say it does. Its your hardware.


You don't need all the pointless hardware (entire phones), hell you went from a chip doing the work to a weird impossible.
Now you have nothing, so writing emulators is pointless.


Client server stuff that is impossible to verify.


So one will build mining chips with more L2 cache. Bitcoin proved that developing new hardware is worth it.


That would mean, 100% centralized? Only one service controlled by the manufacturer can mine?
Not sure what your point is, nothing of what you said aligns with the reality of hardware, software or mining.

Except other factors like coinage and fee per size. Not simply the fee.
For them to be good spam transactions they probably have a larger size then regular ones. And unless they dug out a new stash and only use everything once, the coinage also does not add to the priority.
Whereas regular transactions have a better fee/size ratio and a priority bonus from the coinage resulting in an overall way higher priority for inclusion.

Anyway, every company that has bitcoin as their operational center (Like 21.co) wouldn't exist without bitcoin. So that GDP is created by bitcoin.
And fyi GDP is a horrible measurement.

During the two weeks to the Sep 18th and Oct 26 adjustments there was no EDA on Bitcoin Cash and hence the majority of the hashrate stayed with Bitcoin for almost the entire duration of the targeting period unlike the other 4 periods where EDAs occured.
If you remove 25-50% of the hashrate for 24-48+ hours from a 2 week period it largely negates the effect additional hashrate has for the targeting period.

Are you saying the company that buys a sidechain would instead move those transactions onto the bitcoin blockchain? Where would the reason for them be, to pay to be on such a secure ledger for things of low value. Those companies would just buy a private blockchain from a consulting company and never settle on the bitcoin ledger anyway.

From your quote...


They served those coins and those customers. They then warn you that you might be involved in illegal activities.
They have to make sure that they are not involved in those illegal matters, so they have to take precautions.
That is the downside of a market with strictly regulated businesses and illegal businesses colliding with perfectly traceable transactions. If they don't play ball feds close them down.
Ideally you would keep coins used with traceable illegal activities inside the illegal-ecosystem and not interact with the regulated entities.

Just like you want to claim that a place that openly pays for opinion is not censored. 
Or that the owner openly lies and misleads people, like on twitter, on this topic. As in no way his intention is to pay for someone that supports free speech to be appointed a mod here.

No matter what they would consider as real bitcoin, in their eyes the post is about that. 
Yet they say it is not.
Clearly a non biased fairly moderated open space.

If it is a big theft, they are probably marked, so you can look it up. But also, if it was a big theft, there would be a topic "xyz coins are moving".
Anyway, technicially, if you know you are in possession of stolen (knowing they are stolen, which you do) goods you have to report it. 
The likelyhood of it being seized is probably small. If there is currently investigation ongoing for the theft of which they were a part of you would probably be questioned as to where you got it from.

What he said a few years back. Lower price = IBM can buy back more shares = his shares earn more.


did a superb job in moving IBM from near-bankruptcy twenty years ago to its prominence today. Their
operational accomplishments were truly extraordinary.


financial flexibility improved. Indeed, I can think of no major company that has had better financial management, a
skill that has materially increased the gains enjoyed by IBM shareholders. The company has used debt wisely, made
value-adding acquisitions almost exclusively for cash and aggressively repurchased its own stock.


Naturally, what happens to the company’s earnings over the next five years is of enormous importance to us.
Beyond that, the company will likely spend $50 billion or so in those years to repurchase shares. Our quiz for the
day: What should a long-term shareholder, such as Berkshire, cheer for during that period?




250 million shares for its $50 billion. There would consequently be 910 million shares outstanding, and we
would own about 7% of the company. If the stock conversely sells for an average of $300 during the five-year
period, IBM will acquire only 167 million shares. That would leave about 990 million shares outstanding after
five years, of which we would own 6.5%.


million greater under the “disappointing” scenario of a lower stock price than they would have been at the higher
price. At some later point our shares would be worth perhaps $11⁄2 billion more than if the “high-price”
repurchase scenario had taken place.


money or indirectly (through your ownership of a company that is repurchasing shares), you are hurt when stocks
rise. You benefit when stocks swoon. Emotions, however, too often complicate the matter: Most people, including
those who will be net buyers in the future, take comfort in seeing stock prices advance. These shareholders resemble
a commuter who rejoices after the price of gas increases, simply because his tank contains a day’s supply.


human behavior to know the futility of that – but we do want you to be aware of our personal calculus. And here
a confession is in order: In my early days I, too, rejoiced when the market rose. Then I read Chapter Eight of Ben
Graham’s The Intelligent Investor, the chapter dealing with how investors should view fluctuations in stock
prices. Immediately the scales fell from my eyes, and low prices became my friend. Picking up that book was one
of the luckiest moments in my life.


an important secondary factor will be how many shares the company purchases with the substantial sums it is
likely to devote to this activity. And if repurchases ever reduce the IBM shares outstanding to 63.9 million, I will
abandon my famed frugality and give Berkshire employees a paid holiday.

Major flaws, it says Google and Paypal get your credit card information, but omit that with Apple and Samsung, they too get your information. Even more so, since you don't even need a credit card for Google and Paypal, yet they explicitly list it.
Clearly shows a bias towards those 2 systems. Listing both as "Most Secure" while probably being less so compared to the other 2.
On bitcoins under Security it says "Secure" but goes on to discuss other safety responsibilities that while true, exist for the others aswell, just that they are handled by the service and credit card providers. Hence the fees.
Basicially lists lack of acceptance twice under cons.
States an opinion on acquiring bitcoins, but does not go into any of the other required things (Credit cards/accepted paypal countries/$600+Cellphones)
tl;dr first 3 rows are ok, rest is trash.

Because there is one entity required to patch a bug in iOS while there are a few thousand(many non existant a few months after the handset release) in order to patch all android devices, hence there are plenty of android devices vulnerable.
That has nothing to do with the security architecture. (Aren't all modern OS using a similar architecture anyway?)
[And there were plenty of exploits for iOS, and there will be in the future](
While iOS only has one app source it still lets in malware. [See XcodeGhost](
On Android devices you can install apps from any source, hence it is a easier target for criminals to dupe foolish users.

True, but on the other hand, if the network is not congested, blocks include transactions that are paying the minimum fee, or if none exist are left partially empty.
The second one is a clear indicator, the prior relies on people not paying more for no reason and as transactions show people are paying those high prices at the same time transactions with minimum fees get included.
So i rather stick with the clear indicator.


No the fee level is not related to how full a block is. A block can be full with 1s/B transactions. And as mentioned above, plenty of people pay a high fee for no reason.


Transaction number also does not include the transaction size, which is why i pointed to the lower graph in a previous comment. The majority of the mempool size was taken up by transactions paying the minimum. Roughly speaking, 4000 transactions taking up about 30 blocks worth of space. Whereas most blocks contain around 1000-2000 normal sized transactions.


I pretty much said everything once twice or even three times by now. If you don't want to know then continue to not read my comments i guess.

Scaling does not have to reflect an increase nor has to be related to size.

Yea, a hard fork with &lt;2 month lead time. I could say &lt;1 but its almost the same anyway.


We are talking about every fork, because you suggested it should be the practice.


 Who decides if a fork will be valuable, what is the limit, you want the exchange to decide the limit? 
Also what timeline to decide if it is or not?  Wait 1 day if the fork even mines a block? When to stop caring when they dont mine one? What if they are mining a good chain but the value drops rapidly?
You want the ICO warriors to control exchanges and block their deposits and withdrawls for months?
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:11:54
If you sent the bitcoin transaction, they cant refund the network fee, as that is already gone. And to refund they have to again pay a network fee.
You also said you used coinbase, you probably forgot that coinbase charges a withdrawl fee that includes that network fee. (Resulting in the underpaid situation)
All of that information was displayed during your interaction with bitpay and coinbase, but if you aren't used to it you can overlook these things.

Your coins are not "in electrum" your coins are in an address, electrum holds the private key to that address.
You can take the private key from electrum and use it in any other wallet.
After the split the coins will still be in the same address, spendable with the same private key.
Just that if there are two chains, you can spent them on both chains. The tricky part is, spending it on one chain and not on the other.

The problem, how do you know you talked to the actual account owner and not someone who bought his banking details. If the account owner can show that the transaction was innitiated by someone else, chase has to either cover it or will reverse it depending on what their rules are.
Also "can not be reversed" does not mean "won't ever be reversed"*. It just means you need to escalate the issue to fraud.

If that block contains an invalid transaction all nodes will reject the block. 
Again, they don't download the "hash" and add it to their chain.


They check if computing the inputs you give them result in a valid hash. And as you want to introduce invalid transactions in the block they will reject the block as those transactions have no valid input.
There are plenty of valid hashes, that does not make them valid blocks.

Criminal intent is not a touchy feely thing either. And the dos for hire example was just because you said


Which has no foundation in reality. The paying is seperate. But even if you paid, you could still be denying service to other customers due to your usage of the service you paid for. So while the statement itself is true, it has no meaning. So my response was just as true and related to your comment as yours was.
And anyway contradicting your own point from above with the protocol you went into


They pay the cost that is required to send a email. Same as either party that sends a bitcoin transaction. 
And you go on.

The amount of money he posseses stops him.
As he would need to buy truly all (that still are in actual possession of entities). And the fewer there are the higher the price, as the remaining supply would still be at or above the current capacity in terms of dollar value. So if he were not to increase the price at all during his mad buying spree. The last Bitcoin he'd have to buy would cost him $40 Billion+. On top of the trillions he'd have to spent up to that point. Did i say bitcoin? The last satoshi, or the by then created smaller fraction of it. In other words, in his best case, he'd have to spent an infinite amount of $40 billion.

So you are saying being able to move 250000+ bitcoin within a week as demand for it comes up is not?
Would you prefer your exchanges to have weak storage that can be instantly accessed?


You don't seem to understand the fundamental differences between those two. One results in two distinct chains that are clearly defined, the other, if occuring would be a wait for a reorg.


They will need to process more cold storage addresses, which takes some time. So if more people would request with less time left than that requires it can't be done.
Remember that they are a business, while they can certainly work long hours, they can't be there 24/7. And certainly not the selected group that is required to access storage.

So we moving the goalpost again? Are we forgetting "core and small blockers" say that segwit is effectively 4MB blocks?
Also why "XMB average blocksizes". I haven't heard anyone talking about average size before, it was usually max blocksize.


Except you did


Or did you forget already?


Even thought we now know that this is nonsense anyway. Just because someone is opposed to it NOW, does not mean they are opposed to it. Scaling means adapting to the circumstances, not increasing pointlessly beyond current requirements.


Why average again? And core certainly created such code, or do you expect that many people to never write something simple as that?
Or you mean commited to the core codebase, i mean why? It is not their fault they are close to two years behind on their roadmap. Why do you need the next step in scaling before the previous is rolled out anyway?


See above.






You are missing the terms "now" and you are missing the contradiciton to one of your earliest posts, and now with your statement of it being 4MB max you also contradict the facts you presented at the beginning.


But who cares about details right?


The only cited so called really small blocker you brought up was a legitimate thought that was based on the current transaction volume at that point in time. The big blockers seem to be ignoring the transaction volume and prefer to "scale" early so that users don't have to pay above the minimum fee requirement of 1s/B. But why stick to reality when you can make up pointless groups of people that don't exist.


We came a long way from not supporting segwit to supporting segwit to not supporting segwit2x, is that where we end now or will small blockers be supporting segwit2x soon?


At least you now have changed how you define that term, but you are still missing the "for now". Or a better phrase would be "people who oppose blocks that are significantly larger than what is required"
But that doesn't go well with a nonsensical term that "small block" is.


Oh you mean like i mentioned above and how he says himself?


And how am i "wrong" when i simply stated that he supports segwit? Which you at one point painted as not being a small blocker and being a small blocker? Just because he can see the fact that it is not required now, does not mean he can't support the next step, which he very vocally does. But i guess it is better to pick out the one where he simply outlines facts that are opposed to it instead of the constant support he voices for it. And i mean, why read his entire post to understand what he is actually saying, when you can just pick out a simple phrase that supports what you say.

There was no time in 2016 where real transactions took multiple days. Not even during the nonsense this may were transactions you wanted to get processed not being processed. Yes the fees were higher in may, but people still pay the high fees even now when you can get into a block with a fraction of that.
Even at the height in may/june the tps were below 4tps during the time you talked about they were below 3tps

Where is the point going that far, do you even know the tx volume peak? You can just raise it above where it is now and see. There is no point in doubling or even quadrupling instantly when you could make gradual increases. And as we are already getting an increase that comes close to double, why not take the opportunity to observe, instead of advocating for yet another change before looking at it?


Again, this nonsens has no place here. I neither said we can't, nor i said they are full which they aren't. If they were full the mempool would increase.

Buy USD shorts with USD? There is no such thing, you'd have to short a currency pair USD is in. So now you are betting that USD goes down and the other does not go down more at the same time.

@_date: 2017-07-13 18:45:23


You were talking about block size or the size of the transactions contained in blocks. At least that is what i based my response on.


And all my examples were an increase in usage. Just not on-chain, and not in sidechains or pegged second layers. But off-chain based on trusted third parties. Hence my reasoning that off-chain is not a accurate enough term to use when you have all the superior options, ones that do not include trust based solutions.

@_date: 2017-07-22 21:41:21


Again you destory your own comment. A 4 (yea.. 8mb) MB block would not suddenly increase the fees miners get. It would at first reduce the fees per transaction to next to nothing until the blocks are constantly filled again. At which point you would then have to increase the size again to hold true to what you promised the users of your chain. So your promise to the miners of the chain, as you have to abide by your promise to the users, is that the transaction fee will always be the minimum. (Which in sum for 8mb blocks is still less than now)
Also segwit itself does not push any transaction off the main chain. 
UAHF is just a bunch of nothing just as bitmains announcement post of it was over 50% more or less direct lies and constructed facts.

Why not one that buys you bitcoin like @_date: 2016-07-13 14:24:43
To accomondate all transactions the value of bitcoin has to be big enough so that all players can hold sufficient funds to innitiate those transactions. Which means the exchange rate will have to be very high.
To secure the blockchain the price will potentially rise above the current daily consumption of max
(144 * reward(block_reward+fees) * exchange_rate)/energy price
As the value a disruption could be above the reward for miners, so insitituions that could lose a lot would subsidize the mining.
So the energy consumption could be above that.
Lets take an arbitrary future where the block reward including fees is around 1 btc. The entire world is using bitcoin and market cap is around
1388888900000 one coin being 694444.445 (20mio bitcoins mined) we will assume power prices will have fallen to 5c for industrial purposes. (Those chinese already mining for less...)
According to wikipedia "World total final consumption of 104,426 TWh"
144*694444.445 = 100000000.08 ---- So around $100 million in power will have to be used *0.05 = 20,000,000,001.6 WH being 0,02 TWh per day 7.3 TWh per year.
144*6944444.445 = 1000000000.08 ---- 1 billion - 0,2 twh/day - 73 TWh per year
above * 10 = 10 billion - 2 twh - 730 TWh per year
-|- * 10 = 100 billion - 20 twh - 7300 TWh per year
-|- * 10 = 1 trillion - 200 twh - 73000 TWh per year ($0.05 is cheap, world spent 6 trillion for 104000 TWh)
-|- * 10 = 10 trillion - 2000 twh - 730000 TWh per year &lt; crossing current world production
-|- * 10 = 100 trillion - 2000 twh - 7300000  TWh per year
So until the market cap passes around twice 138.888.888.888.900.000 (130 trillion) our current(*2012 figure) energy production is sufficient.
And as not every single existing thing of value has to be represented in Bitcoin, 130 trillion is WAAAAAY to high, 1-10 trillion would be PLENTY..... oh wait inflation, maybe we'll get there, unless bitcoin..
And there also have to be nodes that require power, input and output devices for users to send check and recieve transactions and computers that listen to transactions and relay them to the intended purpose etc
@_date: 2017-07-11 22:47:49


The blockchain, search for zero fee transactions.
Software can have manual limits in place, but no one is stopping you from creating a transaction with a fee of zero.
It wouldn't confirm right now tho, as there is a like 20mb of 1sat/b transactions

Don't use bad software and then complain about something else being bad. Also when you talk about fees, the proper terminology would be how many satoshi per byte you pay. As that how it is charged. Not per transaction or per value.
Currently the fee is 40-60 sat/B very close to dropping down to 20.
So the fee for a normal transaction is around $ 0.19 right now.
As example: 
While some luck for the block timing, one minute wait time to confirmation.
Few others
The block from 1 min ago even has a 20sat/B transaction/$0.12 and over 100 with a fee below $0.30.

Because you never transmit the private key. Ever.
You can create it with dice or cards or just make up numbers. (Probably insecure as not necessarily a good source of random numbers due to bias). And do the math on paper.
Or easier obviously on a pc that is never connected to the internet.


Used addresses are public anyway.


All code is open source, if there is a backdoor it must be the best backdoor ever created. As why would the original creator even need one? He already possesses a vast amount of bitcoin simply by having mined early on. By a backdoor being there he would lose way more than he could ever gain using one.
With other coins, as you talk about "block chain technology", yes. Plenty of other coins are set up to "scam" people. Mostly by infected the miners or wallets with malware, either from start or later, or even taking up an abandoned project to do so. Besides most others just being pump and dumps without any value otherwise.

Lightweight wallets rely on specific servers that provide them with the data.
While other wallets download everything and look at it themself. Lightweight wallets give that task to others and then just ask them if anything happened with the address they use.
This involves trusting that server. But the worst attack the server can do is give you a wrong balance or not forward your transaction.
You can run such a server yourself on your computer and connect to it from your other devices where you are running such lightweight wallets.
The recovery part is independent. In either case you have a private key or a seed. The wallet is still on your device, there is no "remote" there. The phrase of random words is based on bip39 or similar implementations.
It is like creating a password. But instead of having 26 letters, or ~100 characters to choose from. You have ~2000 characters represented by words.

Miners assign priority in a way so they gain the most money.
The size of a block is limited and a transaction has a size that varies by number of inputs and outputs.
So they include transactions that have the highest fee per size.

You are basicially describing finding a block that is several^several^several^several^several^several^several^several^several^several^several magnitudes higher in difficulty than anything a miner would need to do.
And the use case you think about is hindering new users by having them manually delete a block after googling their issue.
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:44:55
Its quite easy. Do you have to change your behavior in order to not be negatively impacted by this event?
Having to shut down deposits and withdrawls and even trading would be a positive response to that.
Also note that, even when adapting, you can't avoid the negative impact that not running your business for a while has.
Their original "anti-replay" protection also forced users to create transaction on this blockchain in order to use the other. Which also is an attack. And there was vocal resistance to changing it by some.
So it is clear that it is an attack and at least some people intentionally want it to be an attack.

Known event? What was it 2 weeks? Also why known event? Every event is known when it happens and unknown before it is announced. Why clarify "known" in this case, even thought it would fall more in the other category due to the short timeframe.
You mean why customers delayed their decision, also kind of portraining the notion that there is not such a great demand for it, making them hold on readying more cold storage?
There was close to no delay before the transaction hit the blockchain in the days after the first email.
Or you mean why customers didn't bother to properly increase their limits to match the funds they stored there for months to years?
As evident by their actions they were prepared for an unknown event possibly occuring.
If you consider the cold wallets touched they did a lot of work in that short time.
Lets see
16ZbpCEyVVdqu8VycWR8thUL2Rd9JnjzHt 	66,650 BTC 06/29/2017

I just did.
You didn't even think short term. You want &lt;5s/B transactions, for forever. With blocks growing limitless as people keep filling them with tumbling, as it is that cheap. 
If only there were a limit that would prevent that growth of transactions that are only done because they are almost free.
You also want to start on a chain with a dev team you know nothing about, who never produced a significant complex piece of code and ignore those that have based on baseless fud you love to spread everywhere.

You live where you live, you pay the government for that privilege. If you don't like it move elsewhere. If you can't do your job there, you'll notice how dependent you were. If you can, why are you complaining and not moving.


There is the flaw in your argument. You would be claiming you are superior to other humans as such that your time truly is worth so **much** more than theirs. Not talking about €60 per hour compared to €10. But thousands compared to that.
Are you truly putting in even more hard work for that 100.001st euro? You are just doing the same hard work, no doubt it is hard work, but is it truly more and harder when you raise up in your payscale due to seniority. Often it is even easier.
Also the main problem would be that a economy needs money to flow in order to work. If rich people were to earn more than they could spent there would be less and less money in circulation. Less money for poor people who spent, so less profits, so you'd earn less in the end. So every tax dollar you spent goes back into the economy and benefit you. If you have problems with how they are spent, it is your government. Stop being lazy and do your duty as citizen and hence part of the government.


the current standards are a complex system that involves the tax flow. So maintaining it while cutting, while possible, is hard work. And that hard work would fall on the government, which those who want that hard work to be done don't trust with the easier work they are supposed to be doing anyway.

I think their vault offering has the option of giving you control of the keys. If you want full control you'd have to withdraw it from coinbase into a wallet you create yourself. If you don't feel comfortable, you might consider the risk of keeping it on coinbase lower than you screwing up somehow doing it yourself.
You only have to worry about august 1st when you want to make a transaction. As long as you don't move your coins they will remain where they are.
The risk is when there are two chains and you create a transaction on one chain, but not on the other, then there is the risk of replay attacks.
So as long as you hodl while in control of the keys, there is no risk at all, except if you care about the fiat value of your hodlings, there is always the risk of a be a decrease in that.

More words would add more security. But 12 is already hard if not impossible to bruteforce.
Look at passwords, 8 characters are somewhat considered secure for online use. (please use more ;))
It is created by picking from numbers (10 different ones: 0-9), letters (52 different ones: A-Z and a-z) and special characters (32 different ones). So you don't even have 100 options per position.
Now look at the seed, each of those 12 words comes from a pool of over 2000 words.
So you have a 12 character password with over 2000 options per character.
So there are over 252.436.545.388.198.996.261.920.000 seeds (math might be somewhat off, but the direction should be the same)

There weren't many easy free exploits on the market... so the scale was always different as they had to actually put effort into distributing. Maybe start by reading a rough overview about what you are talking.
Imagine if the person who launched this attack paid actual black market prices for 0 day exploits of this potential. Or the wannacry attacker.
They'd have lost a ton of money. Hence attacks that used sophisticated exploits were usually targeted at high value targets and also didn't do shoddy work on the actual payload.

He does a good job of analyzing and coming to the conclusion that it doesn't work for everyone, but instead of coming to that conclusion after he does such great work, he just throws out the usual garbage at the end.




The main flaw with his analysis is he assumes it to be a solution for everyone and everything. Nothing is a solution for everyone and everything. It has use cases for which it lightens the load on the main chain, and hence it is a working scaling solution for those with those use cases.
He repeats his limited view in the above quoted final thoughts of his again. That a simple blocksize increase is the solution for everyone and everything.
It is like saying two people are not allowed to exchange opendime because it is not on chain. That is wrong. Everyone is allowed to use a solution that enables them to make their transactions work better. Yet no one should be forced to use a solution someone else uses.

If it cought up, that would mean it contains everything that is in it until now. So everything will be as it was. If it were making its own chain, their new block would never reach any of the current nodes as it doesn't extend their current chain.




Yes as they would be on their own chain if they were doing the previous thing, and their own chain has no value as they are alone on it.


There are certainly ways, raw mining power must be one of the most inefficient ones.


Somewhat, the hashing power is required to secure the ledger, if the cap were to raise while the hashingpower remained unchanged, then it would certainly endanger it. But the cap raising means the price going up and mining becoming more desirable as the profit goes up. So hashpower will get added.

Exactly. I mean, how would this be included in the transaction the person sends? It is not saved for each transaction, as confirmations isnt even a static number to begin with. It is just information the explorer you look at generates. Not part of a transaction as those things are only known after the transaction is created.


You are also talking about "removing" the witness data from the block, as not all is contained in the actual block on the blockchain that is correct. So why do you then go on and show an example of it being in there (which it is not, just displayed there for convenience of someone browsing that websites explorer)
This is closer to the "raw transaction".

Basicially, not everything is signed with your key. So someone else could come along and change things in your transaction and submit it with a new hash.
Now, the important things cant be changed, like the amount origin and destination, so it is not like someone will steal something directly from this one transaction.
But the transaction you first submitted and its hash can be important, as it is the transaction that services register and look for confirmations on. If now the alternative transaction is confirmed, those services see the transaction with the hash you sent be rejected as double spent and whatever followup action wont happen.
This somewhat hinders more complex and automated processes.

So you are saying, a proposal to stop a single entity from controlling bitcoin is the thing that makes us divided?
Not the single entity?
Not their stupid proposal that is essentially the segwit feature list, just worse? (**is added by me**)

Continued featurelist, containing pointless repeats and obvious statements


8,000 to 10,000 tx per block.












Continued featurelist, idiotic statement that is undermined by the inherently flawed timeline and process this approach was started in, combined with 3 already failed attempts.


To recap: a worse feature presentation, an empty mailing list and a github that has no significant change from core implemented yet. 
It seems you are totally unaware what this roadmap entails.

Third why would you have that income counted as personal income if you had that much?




Fourth if you had that much income why would it matter if you had €150.000 or €200.000.
You most certainly are using a large part of the governments provided infrastructure at such high incomes, if not at least due to the fact that your or your companies customers are.
And as you said, if you earn enough. That already concludes the fact that the income is sufficient so the taxes don't matter as you yourself stated the money is enough.

You want to make sure that there are two independent secrets an attacker would need, to gain control over your account. Otherwise 2FA is just a pointless word.
If you use your email for login aswell, then an attacker would only need to gain access to that email account. He then can reset the password to whatever else you want to protect. In that case verification codes to email are no added security. (They are against other attackers, but we want our accounts to be safe against the real threats.)
The second factor that provide full access to your email account should only be used for that. If you use the same second factor for any other place it provides no added security against focused attacks.
Obviously this all depends on the impemention on the service you are using. One of the "easy" things you can do is use emails and phone numbers that no one knows. And don't reuse them incase one service leaks them.
There is no harm in having the sms confirmation codes on login, as long as an attacker can't use the phone number to circumvent the password.

There is a difference between the private key, access to which means you own the bitcoins contained in the associated address.
And a wallet, which is a broad term for a plethora of implementations of software/hardware that are designed to hold a private key and streamline sending and receiving.
As almost any PC can get hacked with a determined enough attacker any wallet that relies on the host systems security is flawed and can be hacked.


The Trezor wallet is probably "safer" than a bank. However banks are still insured to some degree, so even if the bank isn't safe, your assets are to some degree.

I mean imagine if you were buying 10% of an apple share. It would need to move $100 so you would be getting $10 in profit. And $5 order fees are pretty common at the stock market. So you would be making zero on a $100 move. It is not that much different here.

German Gref, the head of Russia’s largest bank, stateowned
Sberbank, has publicly called for the legalization of
bitcoin and a coffee shop at Sberbank’s Moscow headquarters reportedly accepts payment in the virtual currency. Boris
Titov, the Kremlin’s business ombudsman, and Alexei Kudrin,
a former finance minister, have also spoken out against banning cryptocurrencies.
“We have crypto-adepts in high places,” says Vladimir
Smerkis, the co-founder of the Token Fund, a blockchainbased
investment vehicle for investing in digital assets.
Real-life limits
While ICOs are happening with increasing frequency, levels of
knowledge about cryptocurrencies are very low.
“There are between 10,000 and 20,000 people who more or
less know about cryptocurrencies in Russia,” says Smerkis.
“And when the economy is very small, the volatility is very
Some of the attempts to integrate bitcoin into Russia’s
everyday financial infrastructure have met with failure. The
country’s first bitcoin exchange point opened on central
Moscow’s New Arbat Street last year, but shut-down within four months because of a lack of demand. The exchange
charged customers 4 percent commission during the day
and 10 percent commission at night to convert bitcoin into
“People are scared and would prefer to work online,” says
a representative of the now-defunct exchange office, who
declined to give his name because of fears about the legality
of the operation. The representative added that he would be
ready to open another such exchange point if regulatory conditions improved.
“If there are a green light and new laws then maybe we
will try to open one again,” he says. “Cryptocurrencies are becoming mainstream.”
A representative of another bitcoin exchange point in Moscow that opened last year
—and was reported as the country’s
second such outlet
—did not respond to repeated calls from
The Moscow Times.
Bubble fears
Cryptocurrency critics suggest that strong demand is in danger of overheating the market and warn of a possible crash.
According to Skolkovo’s Novikov, interest in ICOs is “inflating
too quickly.”
“At the moment it’s a pure bubble,” says Chronopay’s
Vrublevsky. “But when they are able to use cryptocurrencies
to invest in the real economy, [things] will have reached the
next stage.”
Nearly $250 million has been put into ICOs across the
world, according to Smith+Crown, a cryptocurrency research
firm. Most of this sum, $107 million, was raised in 2017.
While the value of most leading cryptocurrencies has risen
through their trading life spans, the increase has also been
accompanied by occasional sharp price falls and violent volatility on exchanges.
Russian Central Bank Governor Nabiullina has warned of
the “many risks” of using bitcoin. Many ordinary Russians
still remember the substantial losses they incurred from feverish investment in pyramid schemes that flourished in
the 1990s
Naibullina’s point is taken up by Novikov, who suggests
that any rapid move towards legalization of crypto-currencies
in Russia could spark even more interest in ICOs and stoke a
buying frenzy.
There will be “sad consequences,” if that happens, he says:
“It would be like taking someone with a temperature to the
sauna.” TMT

Yes, if coinbase were to decide it won't support one you'd lose those coins. But realisticly, if that chain holds value, that would mean a lot of legal backlash against coinbase as people lose money.
So with the vault you can potentially be in full control.
If i recall correctly, you had two options with the vault. One coinbase takes care of it all. And the second you get keys aswell. A multi sig wallet where you and coinbase each have one key and a third key is encrypted with a password you provide. Two keys are needed for a transaction. 
That means in the worst case you can take your and the encrypted key and create the transactions yourself.
You just can't lose them. If you lose both your private key and the password to the third key, your coins can't be recovered. 
It also means if you don't store them securely and an attacker obtains both he can take your coins.

It can crash to zero, while currently the chances are tiny to non existent, it can happen. 
And there could appear a superior alternative which would also drasticially reduce the value. As a big part of the current value is not based on its current use, but expected future uses.
So if you are not prepared for that small chance, dont.

If they are on a website they have their fees listed somewhere, that includes the fee paid to miners.
If they are in a wallet you control, the main thing is the number of inputs. If you look up your address on a site like blockchain.info it should show the incoming transactions that make up your balance. If it is only one, the transaction should be around 190-225 byte.
@_date: 2017-06-05 11:30:22
As long as you buy it on a decently large exchange where an auditor would trust their documentation it should be fine. You will have proof that you acquired them for that price.
Kraken should be fine. Just make sure you save/print your trade history as soon as you are doing buying. In case you forget and the exchange goes out of business during the following years.
Also move them out of the exchange as soon as possible. You will have another piece of evidence that you own them at that point in time, so you could argue for the price that bitcoin was at the time of that transaction.

Fake IDs are easy to make and fraud is a huge deal, as once the bitcoins leave the exchange, they can't get the money back. If the money that came in is reversed they are losing money. So they have to make sure you are who you are so they can hold you accountable.

Mining Money forthe Motherland
After years of skepticism and hostility to cryptocurrencies, Russia thinks
it might be seeing the dawn of a virtual gold rush
Farmer Mikhail Shlyapnikov says creating his own virtual
currency allowed him to raise almost $2 million in two
The currency, the kolion, is named after the Moscow region
village of Kolionovo, where Shlyapnikov lives. During its
April launch period, investors from around the world bought
$500,000 worth of the currency. Since trading began at the
beginning of May, one kolion has almost doubled in price to
be worth just under $2.
Shlyapnikov says that buyers of his agricultural produce
are now looking to acquire kolions—gambling the currency
will continue to strengthen.
“I have a new instrument,” he says. “It’s like getting a
Shlyapnikov’s kolion project is a rare case of cryptocurrencies—of
which bitcoin is the most famous—underwriting
real-life ventures. Up until now, their use has been mostly restricted
to online projects. But experts say examples like that
of Shlyapnikov will become more common as the popularity
of cryptocurrencies grows at break-neck speed.
And expansion in Russia is likely to be fueled further by
a change in rhetoric from officials. Just last week, President
Vladimir Putin made the development of the “digital economy”
a centerpiece of his keynote speech to the St. Petersburg
International Economic Forum.
“It’s an international trend and we are only at the beginning
of this journey,” says Shlyapnikov.
Make bitcoin not war
Cryptocurrencies are built on a technology called blockchain,
a decentralized database for recording financial transactions
and other types of deals. Blockchain was developed for bitcoin,
the value of which soared past $2,800 this week (almost
five times more than this time in 2016).
“Over the last year, blockchain technology entered the real
world,” says Pavel Novikov, the director of financial technology
at Skolkovo, the Russian tech hub.
Many companies that use blockchain raise money by selling
digital coupons that can then be used to buy goods and services
on their platform or saved as an investment.
Such “Initial Coin Offerings,” or ICOs, are increasingly popular.
For example, a group of entrepreneurs and scientists is
currently pushing the sale of a new virtual currency called ZrCoin.
The proceeds of the ICO will be put towards building a
factory in the Russian city of Magnitogorsk that will produce
zirconium dioxide, a chemical used for making heat-resistant
ZrCoin, whose ICO ends Friday, has already proved a success,
collecting over $5.6 million.
Shlyapnikov points out that those who organize ICOs do
not have to be technical experts.
“I don’t understand how blockchain works, I don’t understand
how the internet works, I don’t understand how internal
combustion engines work, I don’t understand how mobile
phones work—but I use all of them,” he says.
The success of ICOs has generated greater interest in bitcoin
and other cryptocurrencies, which are relatively difficult
to transfer into traditional assets.
Pavel Vrublevsky, head of Russian payments firm Chronopay,
says that he only recently realized the potential of
cryptocurrencies. Chronopay announced earlier this month
that it would accept payments in bitcoin from all of its clients,
which include Russian telecoms giant MTS and charities
like Greenpeace.  “As soon as I saw that people were raising real money in
ICOs I got interested,” says Vrublevsky. “Make bitcoin not
Russia’s competitive advantage
The use of blockchain is spreading rapidly in most countries,
but some believe it has a particularly bright future in Russia.
Technical and mathematical education standards in the
Soviet Union were some of the highest in the world, and this
tradition has persisted in modern Russia. Despite declining
standards, the country still produces some of the world’s leading
The founder of Ethereum, the second most popular cryptocurrency
in the world after bitcoin, is Russian-born Vitalik
Buterin, 23. The world’s largest bitcoin manufacturer, or
“miner,” Bitfury, was created by Valery Vavilov, 37, who was
born in then-Soviet Latvia.
“Cryptocurrencies were always popular in Russia,” says
Skolkovo’s Novikov. “Russian-language developers are the
most visible among developers working with blockchain
Marina Guryeva, the founder of several blockchain projects,
says that Russia and other former Soviet Union countries are
drivers of blockchain growth.
The trend is driven, she says, by high technical education
standards, a lack of heavy-handed regulation and the attractiveness
of an investment opportunity not tied to a volatile
ruble or low-interest deposit accounts.
Additionally, cryptocurrencies can give access to investment
to many Russian businesses ineligible for state support
or unable to afford the high-interest loans on offer from domestic
One of Guryeva’s projects, Golos, is a Russian-language social
network built on blockchain technology. She says its success
is driven by the sense of ownership enjoyed by its members
as much as a desire for profit. Golos currently has over
40,000 users and its own cryptocurrency system that means
you can earn money for posting well-received material and
being an active member of the community.
“The value [of the currency] correlates to the number of
users and the popularity of the network,” she says. “Everyone
can feel like they are an owner of what takes place on the
platform, and everyone has the opportunity to influence how
the platform develops.”
Official re-think
A dramatic shift in the rhetoric used by top Russian officials
about cryptocurrencies and blockchain assets in recent
months has given a boost to the fledgling industry. In little
under a year, officials have gone from proposing that cryptocurrencies
should be banned and their users imprisoned, to
suggesting legalization is on the cards.
On June 2, Putin told delegates of the St. Petersburg International
Economic Forum that the digital economy was
“the foundation that will facilitate the creation of a new business
model.” Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov reiterated
the message, telling journalists Putin had “come down with
a bout of the digital economy flu.” He said the president had
kept advisors close up until well after midnight one evening
to discuss the issue.
Putin even met with Ethereum founder Buterin during
the forum. Ethereum raised $18 million during its ICO and 
its currency is currently trading at $256
—18 times more than
this time last year.
Russia’s Central Bank has been more cautious about cryptocurrencies, but its head Elvira Nabiullina told U.S. television
network NBC last week she was “analyzing the possibility” of
Her deputy, Olga Skorobogatova, who oversees cryptocurrencies, announced at the St. Petersburg forum that the Central Bank was considering launching its own cryptocurrency.
Top officials have also reportedly said that discussions are
underway to allow the trading of cryptocurrencies on major
Russian stock exchanges.
Some see the change of attitudes as a result of the work of
influential figures close to Putin known to be in favor of cryptocurrencies.

Most people who want to seriously get into mining want a lot of miners. So it is just easier to find a good renewable source with cheap direct power and stick a building next to it where you can cram in tons of miners.
