I said a wallet that THEY control, they just need to tell me another bitcoin address that is theirs and tell me the amount they are sending, does that not make sense?

Lol this was a sincere attempt to gather survey info, but at least thanks for pointing out that Im not requesting nearly enough info to hack anyone
@_date: 2016-01-29 07:16:30
Thanks for sharing, Is that yours?  I just saw a lot of requests for money lol.
@_date: 2016-01-26 08:08:17
lol I haven't used it yet but from what I've seen (while lurking around) is that it seems to be a fun way to reward productivity.  Im assuming reddit is in on the technology somehow also, but maybe not.

lol a downvote before I even go to bed :)

Yes agreed, the group has significant amounts of processing power wich leads people to believe it is legitimate, the fact is the profits they are projecting are very illegitimate.  The only money being made is through commision.

I was kind of confused I dont have anything in my tx history that says unconfirmed but apparently this:  is what im waiting on.
@_date: 2016-02-02 17:57:53
Also, how might this change in the future.
@_date: 2016-02-16 07:50:58
did you read the $500 part?
@_date: 2016-02-16 04:30:43
okay :)
@_date: 2016-02-18 15:57:06
yeah it doesnt seem to have sent.  im just wondering if it will auto send at some random time
@_date: 2016-02-06 04:45:52
Thanks, i think i get it.
@_date: 2016-02-09 15:58:07
do you really believe it will hit 100?
@_date: 2016-02-05 01:34:30
Thats the address and the deposit into it was me, but when i sent .0166 it sent to an address that i dont seem to control. 
@_date: 2016-02-05 05:13:40
yeah.  Thats a good idea.
@_date: 2016-02-10 07:06:57
millions would, if im not mistaken, mean it would overtake the USD...is that necessary for its survival?  If it is the 3rd or 4th reserve currency I think it will still be fine.
@_date: 2016-02-10 00:44:16

Damn! ya got me.

It seems like not only do old people not use bitcoin but young people dont use it either.
@_date: 2016-02-16 04:07:57
I believe it will be more usable, more accepted and will have a larger user base.  I also believe that the USD and CAD and CHF will only get worse in terms of devaluation.  Im not sure what you mean about my current financial situation, Im not rich but I also dont need the money.  I do have plenty if something came up.
