Again, I don’t know where you work or what you do, but I strongly suspect it’s something along the lines of system administration/tech support. I feel like those communities must use the term differently because no one I know that actually develops internet protocols uses it that way.
If not, I’m really surprised our experiences differ so much.

The price would up after a halving if most people didn’t know about it. Now that it’s widely expected to happen, it’s likely priced in already.
@_date: 2019-06-06 05:33:58
Is that possible? I thought a channel had to be opened and closed with a fixed amount, only the allocation between the parties would change.

Sure, blockchain size is an issue, but it's a separate one from fees and spam. In regards to fees and spam specifically, they have the same effect. Raise fees and potentially reduce spam, or lower fees and potentially increase spam.


Just because existing solutions have problems doesn't mean that we shouldn't emulate the things they do well. That's throwing out the baby with the bathwater. The future of crypto needs to be something as understandable and usable for the average user as existing services, while *also* offering other benefits.

Mining helps the network. A non-mining full node doesn’t contribute much, tbh.

TCP/IP specifically refers to TCP. I have never heard of it being used to refer to the internet protocol stack in general. The UDP/IP stack is generally referred to as such.
At least within computer science. Maybe it’s misused among sysadmins or the general population.
@_date: 2019-06-10 20:25:37


Competing in the sense that they're mutually exclusive, not that they're antagonistic. Multiple protocols exist at each layer because they all serve different purposes.
Which is exactly the point I was trying to make. Bitcoin doesn't need to stamp out all other cryptocurrencies to be successful. Several can co-exist and complement each other's use cases.




Not sure what you're even going on about here.


Lol, still funny to me you think this is some sacred thing.
@_date: 2019-06-18 19:21:16
There’s only one reference implementation. That’s why it’s the *reference* implementation.
@_date: 2019-06-10 03:23:32
I guess our experiences differ, but in my experience, no one says “TCP/IP” to mean the entire suite of internet protocols. Maybe it’s different between different communities (academic, development, system administrators, etc.).
At university, everyone I knew doing researching on networking used pretty specific terminology. Since I’ve started working, no developer I’ve ever met uses it that way either.


I’m not saying UDP (or TCP, for that matter) is ever used over anything but IP in the real world. This is why it’s the internet protocol stack. Because it all bottlenecks around the Internet Protocol.
I’m just saying I’ve never heard anyone use TCP/IP when they don’t mean something that’s actually using both TCP and IP.
@_date: 2019-06-10 19:05:00


Lol, okay. The fact that you can’t even imagine this happening tells me everything I need to know.
The internet isn't some static thing that was built however long ago by some select group of geniuses. It's just an ever-evolving collection of random standards by random dudes like me arguing over mailing lists, then publishing and implementing RFCs.


This whole weird tangent was irrelevant to my original point. I just followed you into it because, you know, people are being wrong on the internet. My point was that, even within the single internet protocol stack, there are competing protocols *at every layer*. The UDP lead-in was just one example. If he had said “internet protocol suite” instead, I would’ve left out that one jab, but the main content of the post has nothing to do with the specific nomenclature.
@_date: 2019-06-08 06:19:59


UDP.... not to mention all the application, link and physical layer protocols. The internet stack was designed to be hourglass shaped. And even at the internet layer, it’s a little disingenuous to treat IPv4 and IPv6 as one thing.

Block size only indirectly prevents spam. What's really preventing spam is high fees. The problem is, high fees do not selectively make it harder for spammers to use the blockchain, it makes it harder for *everyone* to use the blockchain. So, this approach is a really fine line to walk, what's a reasonable fee that doesn't hinder actual usage, but is high enough to make it uneconomical for things you don't want the blockchain to be used for?


All of these have the same effect as big blocks vis-a-vis spam and usage. They make more transactions possible for the same amount of work. Therefore, they lower fees (good for users), but also lower the barrier for spam.
Personally, I think it's better to err on usability, even if it means putting up with some amount of blockchain space being used for things you don't think it's appropriate to be used for. I think it's a losing battle to try to prevent spam by competing to be more expensive than other storage solutions that spammers might use. It depends on so many external factors, and is just a really strange and roundabout approach.
Why not just structure the blockchain in a way that makes it less usable for things it's not meant to be used for? How are companies like Veriblocks even storing arbitrary data via blockchain? Surely there must be some way to prevent it more directly. Maybe something along the lines of Monero, where it's a lot harder to extract meaningful information from any particular transaction?

That’s mostly because Crypto allows pretty open discussion, and you’re not expected to toe any specific party line.

To be fair, gold does have some properties that make it useful and this inherently valuable.
But I agree with the general sentiment. Bitcoin’s value is no more “speculative” than any fiat currency.
@_date: 2019-05-25 07:44:40
Let’s not pat ourselves on the back too much. This is getting into territory.
I truly doubt the average crypto holder is any more educated (much less intelligent) than any random high school graduate in the US. There are plenty of hobbies/interests which require both more knowledge and more raw intelligence.

Even if the payment processors act as middlemen, it still shows the ecosystem as a whole is healthy enough to support them. It shows 1. there are companies willing to make the bet that there will be sufficient volume that they can make a business of taking small cuts of each transaction, and 2. that large retailers are willing to go to the trouble of supporting a payment method available that allows users to pay in Bitcoin (even if indirectly).
In other words, it demonstrates that there’s sufficient demand to spend Bitcoin. I don’t care who specifically accepts the coins, as long as I can use them and get goods and services in return. If it really takes off, you can bet Amazon et. al. will start trying to muscle out the middlemen.

To me, Bitcoin is revolutionary because it gives control back to the people, rather than having a centralized vender which controls all transactions. Liquid, in particular, is directly contrary to the very foundations laid out in the whitepaper.
Even lightning seems to be built around a set of hubs which individual users will have to pay to use as proxies to access the rest of the network (since it’s infeasible for each user to manage individual channels to every single store/person they might want to transact with). I don’t see much difference between keeping most of my money in a bank vs keeping it in a channel to some conglomerate hub operator.
@_date: 2019-05-31 06:43:52
Maybe I misunderstood. I thought you had to maintain an active channel? If it's not directly with whoever you're transacting with, and it's not with some hub node, who is it with?
What about the fact that you have to commit a certain amount of coins to the channel? Is there some workaround for that? That's the biggest sticking point, imo. The fact that you have to tie up your funds, and that you have to commit enough to ensure you can do enough transactions that it'll negate the fees to open and close the channel.

Each layer in the internet protocol stack builds upon lower layers to **extend capabilities**, not to work around shortcomings of the lower layer. In fact, each layer adds additional overhead on the lower layer, and assumes that the lower layer can handle its responsibilities well.
Lightning is the exact opposite. It provides a limited subset of the capabilities of the base layer, while also inverting the chain of responsibilities. Rather than the higher layers depending on the lower layers to function properly, the lower layer depends on the higher layer.
This is just bad design.
A better analogy and example of good layering is smart contracts and distributed apps. Those utilize the capabilities of the lower layer to build a higher layer of abstraction and capability. But the lower layer has no knowledge of how it's being used, and certainly doesn't depend on being used in a certain way to function at all.

Centralized control over Bitcoin development. With business interests which directly lie against the widespread usage of the blockchain, and instead selling a proprietary, centralized alternative.
@_date: 2019-05-31 16:55:52
Interesting. However, that makes the whole system a lot more centralized and less peer-to-peer. Although most users probably won’t care.

@_date: 2019-05-31 01:16:22
Honestly, I'm really surprised that so many people think Lightning has any shot at working. It just makes absolutely no sense from a user perspective. You have to commit all the money you might possibly want to spend on a channel upfront. You have to maintain separate channels with every single entity you'd want to transact with (or else trust a centralized network of hubs). It's just so fundamentally flawed.
@_date: 2019-05-26 07:16:34
You thought wrong. BTC/BCH shit slinging gets ridiculous numbers of upvotes on both this and All of this tribalism is pretty bad for both coins, IMO, and neither camp seem capable of just being the bigger man.

Liquid is created by Blockstream and Blockstream is infallible. That’s the difference.

I’m holding more BTC than BCH atm. But ideologically, I think BCH is a lot more inline with the original whitepaper, and less influenced by entrenched business interests.
