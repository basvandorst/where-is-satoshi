Just got off the phone with Jesus; he says it’s not an error but a feature of bitcoin cash that you can sometimes get a massive discount.
Jesus was also very clear we should not call it bcash; we must call it bitcoin cash, or this feature will stop working.

In trading the ones with power are not your so called whales but the ones who have the ability to produce the commodity of interest.
In this case it’s not refinery/goldmine/powerstation it’s the miners. 
The mining companies do employ traders to sell their bitcoin into the market for the best return possible. These traders are informed of the true mining cost of production of their companies and work with that as their baseline in trading; any price above this is a profitable for them. 
You are not going to be able to compete with these traders. They can go lower than you and still make a profit. If the prices very high they reserves of coin to move and future coins in the pipeline.
They win both directions

This is a good result. 
How many actual fiat dollars (yen, won etc. . .) were put into bitcoin in the run up to higher prices?
How many fiat dollars have traveled into bitcoin in the last month since the December all time high? 
There is a consolidation at hand but at the end of it the the ratio of the market cap to actual fiat totally invested will lower and things will be more stable as a result.

It’s just refreshing that in 2018 we have a round table of people talking about bitcoin, ethereum, tokens and associating it with words like bluechip, equities, and performance all while keeping a straight face on a major business news network.
This time last year the same people were going “bitcoin price is at $1000 dollars” snigger snigger chuckle chuckle.
Also nice that we now have people like mr Lee making useful analogies to existing technologies that layman can understand bring the masses into this new tech; instead of a ranting fool who squanders airtime to talk about his coin fork.
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:53:16
I still think bitcoin core needs a fun loving mascot like Herr Ver. His rants are very comical and quite endearing.
I guess what I am trying to say is since I invested in bitcoin I have felt like king of the world; shouldn’t I be entitled to a court jester and a little entertainment when the market is slow?
@_date: 2019-07-31 13:26:35

At current bitcoin prices that’s approximately 400,000/90,000 = 4.4444444 reoccurring bitcoin. That’s a very bad number in China; no wonder he sued.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:41:57
Not so. I am talking specifically about the critical mass user network that bitcoin. Has that all other alts currently do not have.
There is only room for one major search engine/ global auction site/ social network this is the advantage the bitcoin has; it is the incumbent.
@_date: 2019-07-02 22:05:48
Why?  
Whatever qualities it has was ruined when they rolled back the DAO hack.

Holding your coins is a simple effective strategy.
In all of recorded history of bitcoin a person who has been financially able to retain there coins indefinitely has always seen growth in the value of there portfolio that outperforms any traditional asset class.  
Even people who bought in the disaster gox driven crash. 
Short sighted people are now caught up in the 2017 crash without contemplating that anybody that acquired there coins prior to this time last year is still seeing supernormal appreciation.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:25:47

Hi, I want to support the ecosystem, I would happily make purchases in Bitcoin at retailers that allow it. Many of these companies are passing on  the savings from use of Bitcoin  over creditcards for example.

When it does get approved they will talk about the arrival of the appropriate infrastructure that has now been touted and will be closer to implementation as of the end of next month.

Sadly the more Amy one individual owns the less value bitcoin is. It’s the network of users that is relevant. Market caps and altcoins are laughable.

Any person willing to invade your home and commit extreme violence can take your Bitcoin.  All this fancy tech is nothing compared to a hammer and the fingers of the person who knows the passcode.
Majority of normal people want an insured third party to store protect and insure their coins.
Collective security is as important a tech as sound money which is why things such as insurance is an enduring product through time.
Even so Bitcoin will still offer those that need to posses their own money to hold it and transfer it peer to peer without any middleman (bank;or government) acting as gate keeper. It is still however a rare case.

Don't advise your friends in biz or investments unless they specifically ask you. 
Assuming they asked the best advice is to

2) buy enough bitcoin to order a trezor.
3) download a software wallet onto your phone then transfer your funds to it.
4) purchase a trezor in bitcoin. Once it arrives transfer the remaining funds from your software wallet to the hardware trezor.
5) now that the practical test is over download the internet of money by Andrés Antonopoulus. You can even get it as a free audiobook from audible as a trial subscription if you prefer.
6) do not invest in bitcoin until you feel you understand it well enough to invest your government money (Gcash).

I totally love this model. The two coins have strong potential for different use case. Other interesting coins like ether and zcash have to be paid for but bcash comes for free and well distributed ownership from day one which is the best chance for achieving user critical mass.

Hey you meant well. Just don't get to caught up on the timing this is all going to play out sooner or later.  Try to think of Bitcoin as your nestegg for the future whether that is 5, 10 or 20 years down the road.

I think for that to happen there would need to be a major exit from not just gold but stocks and land and housing investments.  This video hints at that and it is conceivable I guess.  
Certainly as Bitcoin becomes more entrenched people will favor it's liquidity over realestate or the need to hold 20 plus diversified stocks in their portfolios.

If you do decide to buy in I still suggest you dollar cost average.  Perhaps buy $1,000 worth a month. This is even if you are a long term holder. My logic is that if prices drop in the short run you can acquire more btc with your funds and if prices go up you at least have the knowledge your initial investments are already bringing you returns (even if unrealised).

I think it's important to submit comments.
I'm not nearly eloquent enough but the primary points are
-bitcoin is a significant advancement in financial technology. Scientists, governments and corporations have all widely recognized the underlying technology of bitcoin.
-It is highly probable that bitcoin will be propelled to critical mass by various global actors irrespective of the sec decision. There will likely be room for one such product on the global stage; google/search, Amazon/online shopping, eBay/auctions, facebook/social, LinkedIn/networkingHR.
- the sec decision will only determine whether the American masses will be able to capture some of the wealth being generated, as has been witnessed with preceding internet technologies, or whether that will largely be captured by peoples from first mover states.
Just some ideas anyway . . .

Banks get a lot of hate but there is still core function of banking which is to amalgamate small deposits into larger loans providing interest to depositors and opportunity to borrowers.
The hate comes from banks leveraging the trust they have created to expand into endeavors outside of their original scope or for abusing their trust status in the form of higher fees.

This talk about multiple exchanges is a silly waste of time.
Kraken works just fine if your main intention is to use it as an on ramp for bitcoin acquisition.
Simple rule is to port your fiat over acquire your bitcoin and move it on to a hardware wallet asap.
All the margin trading stuff is largely fools gold any one dah trading bitcoin is going to be schooled by the exchanges or the big players ceasing arbitrage opportunities that the rest of us have no visibility of.
Safest approach in buying and selling on any exchange is to buy and sell slowly. Then you have very little exposure to exchange hacks and you get an averaged price with out extreme highs or lows.

It’s likely the cost of borrowed/rented hash for both factions of the hash war were tied directly to the opportunity cost of mining forgone on more valuable chains (bitcoin). 
Probable also that both sides have sold bitcoin in order to fund their takeover endeavor of bitcoin cash which also has the added benefit of being down the commitment costs of hashrate discussed above.
Finally both sides can logically see this as the outcome and will likely have take short positions in futures. Some whales and traders will have done the same and assisted pushing the price over the cliff.

China is about to head into a time of economic crisis.

This can only be implemented if the masses are tied to the RMB. If the masses can escape their fate by moving their wealth and transactions into crypto it is the state that will bare the burden instead.
Until China shuts down mining and mining equipment production they are not banning crypto. If they did this bitcoin would survive because Japan will double down.

This is not diversification.  This is a situation where your single investment has been split into shards beyond your control. One will succeed the other will likely fail.
These splits could happen often.
There is a mantra in this forum that the best option is to hold (hodl)
I'm trying to tell you the best way to survive a chain split 100% of the time is to hold both chains and ignore profits of selling the non encumbent.
@_date: 2017-10-01 09:51:15
Trace Mayer trying to look big.
Why would roger do this when there is strong evidence he could buy that many btc2x for far less in the after math of the split.
It will take time to prove which way will chain will dominate but in the short run we can expect the value of bitcoin to sit higher due to the infrastructure in place wallets, exchanges etc . . . To support.
Why should he do a 1 for 1 when he can do a 10 for 1 swap in the first few weeks after a chain split?
For the record I am pro bitcoin run by bitcoin core. I have kept all bitcoin cash and will keep all 2x as insurance and do expect them to trend towards zero.
Trace Mayer is just baiting and pandering to the wackos on here who can't think for themselves.
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:19:31
Good on you for getting through all the strife and keeping your coins.
I know we sometimes need to reference fiat currency to quantify things, especially to people outside the crypto space, but I hope you have not used it as an opportunity to cash out.
One thing I might suggest is to withdraw the initial invested value of the fiat you put in (including a sum to reflect the time value of the money in a term deposit for example). Put that initial back into a new non crypto investment. Just gives you some diversity and peace of mind?

Pretty sure roger said he will shift focus to bitcoin cash IF the 2X does not go through.
In truth though everyone is going to go where the majority goes; there is only room for currency at critical mass just like there is only one Google, eBay, Amazon and Facebook.
He is allowed and can try to dispose the Core team but will probably fail.

They certainly have.
Hyperinflation historically and currently completely disrupts countries. Germany between the world wars, Zimbabwe in the new millennium, Venezuela now.
But countries have not had an alternative currency that they and their citizens could rapidly adopt divorcing themselves from fiat currency. In the USA case as the issuer of the global reserve currency in which many loans are issued things could get interesting if they adopted bitcoin as there reserve currency.

Maybe the simple balanced approach is to take out the initial after a multiple, say 4 is reached:
You invest $ 1000. When you get to $4000 take back the $1000. When your $3000 becomes $12000 take back you $3000. When your 9000 becomes 36000 . . . And so on.

BU is definitely a power grab from my perspective but he has a legitimate platform that entices miners and those who want bitcoin to be a viable medium for low value transactions at low cost.

@_date: 2017-05-12 08:57:34
Honestly if you believe that bitcoin is the future you are basically believing that a single bitcoin will be outside the reach of the common man within the next 5 years. Just buy it and keep it.

Apparently kleiman was keeping the "data" on a durable USB stick like those Corsair survivors. That's now "missing" but encrypted.

Well while I wait for 9000 it was good to return to a thread from 2 months ago where I stated that the bottom was in and the ascent was real.  It was fun to ping the haters.
My point from that thread was don't talk about Bitcoin this time, don't feel the need to defend Bitcoin or explain it to friends with being asked or evangelise the haters.
 some people are destined to miss the train and will have to walk drudgily through.

The problem is they are happy because of a stable steady price rise.  I agree though you gave them a risk free incentive by giving them the initial stake, it may teach them to stoic when it comes to market fluctuations.
I wonder how many of the no coiners on Reddit and Twitter could be eventually brought around by a relatively small gift in btc.

Yes, I have bought at many price points some lower than the current price and continue to buy small amounts on a frequent basis. This is the only way to stay zen about it all whilst consistently being in the money on the investment proposition as a whole.

I really can't say for sure.
Its funny that people talk around this point like it's a fact but no one I question directly can explain why this must be. All I can determine is that there was an opportunity cost lost of hash war on bch rather than earning through mining btc and perhaps a legal battle when the mining pool controller of the resource is sued by the individual owners of the resource.
The movement in price is probably down to the heavy signalling on mass media scales about potential sell down that became certain self full filling prophecy with trader assistance.
I really wish I could get reliable info on both the major exchanges and the futures markets and I would dig a bit deeper.

The safest thing to do right now is hold your bitcoin. Your not going to be the one that times the market perfectly.
I’d reason that it’s the right time to stay out of alt coins because it’s near impossible to pick which ones will survive at this point. 
Similarly if you can release bitcoin chain splits (abc, sv, gold, diamond) it might be wise to sell for now. For a long time I held these splits as insurance as who really knows which scaling solution is best? But reality is that abc and sv, despite their potential merits, are to tied to personalities at this stage. Bitmain owning million plus of each is a major concern as I don’t think price elasticity will remain low if jihan dumps one or both splits which he may need to do if mining returns remain low.
This is all just my personal assessment and I know many will disagree.
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:21:08
These scare tactics are designed to ward of mainstream people from dabbling in bitcoin. They will squash a few to create fear in the timid people who have a lot of their lives invested in the current system: careers, mortgages, a stable place in society.
