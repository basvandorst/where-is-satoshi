Right **** here, I'm not giving up that easy to the fucking manipulative whales. This time, we the people, will be in charge.
Edit: *toned down*

So, did he touch you?
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:20:23
Or it is being manipulated. Whatever floats your boat.
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:21:42
I'm pretty sure the segwit2x hard fork is an attack we need to fend off. Ensure that there are no more hard forks.

@_date: 2017-10-08 09:31:14
We need more positive people like you.

Kudos to you for taking the time to analyze this, I agree with all your points. Question is, how can we stop this hijacking of Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:23:52
The market lol.
@_date: 2017-10-08 11:46:43
Kind of like saying, "we don't mow our lawns, that'd only make the grass grow up stronger."
No need to feed the trolls, but a divided community where the public don't have trust in the dev team does seem worrying.
Then again I don't know what is real anymore.
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:19:11
I said nothing about harmony, I'm saying we need to stop this hijacking of Bitcoin by these bank whales.
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:11:36
The only answer that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:12:53
I'm saying that we had a hard fork in August now another one in November, then maybe one in January... Who knows when it'll end!!
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:17:14
Are you sure? I'm pretty sure there is a fork coming in November, and unless this is Bitcoin cash, everyone here will be affected as this goes on.

Fomo regarding the fork. I expected it to go all the way up to a 10k.
Edit: though I thought after it stabilized it wasn't going to do parkour anymore.
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:38:20
Ah I see. However, this type of thing drives away new adopters. I tell my peers and they tell me about all the drama going on. Which really grinds my gears.

~~Do you have a billion dollars?~~ Or equivalent in cryptos?if not then you also don't have any money.
Edit: all you need is tree fiddy to make a change.

That's your defense? Sounds like what a kid says when you say "why are you scared of bugs" to him. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 17:14:19
You had all the time to give your opinion, but you chose to get triggered... That's a great way to show how well your education system is doing. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:35:38
So talking about the French government in a conversation about the French government is nonsense? Looks like French education system is going downhill fast. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:17:13
Look who is resorting to ad hominem attacks... 
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:09:53
French government is a puppet, I don't care for what it has to say. They can't even make their own missiles for air strikes in Syria. Such a useless country that taunts others is just laughable.
