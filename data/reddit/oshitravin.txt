I agree with some people won't waste time with a low purchase. However, I once bought $30. Try asking around as well.

Haha, awesome! 
Hmm, it's a bit tough to think about three great things, so let me go over three interesting things :)
1) It's incredibly remote but easily accessible. We have multiple daily flights from mainland Norway to Longyearbyen. 
2) Bill Bailey came here to perform a few weeks ago.
3) It's illegal to be born and to die here.

The misleading title aside, this seems to be a great idea. As a digital nomad, this would definitely be something that I could use. Thanks for sharing!

If anyone comes to Longyearbyen, Svalbard (northern-most "real" town in the world!) by any chance tomorrow, I'll buy you pizza in exchange for bitcoin :)

Awesome! Hope to hear more success stories with Bitcoin

Fantastic! One of the fastest I've ever had next to working in tech support. We have a fiber optic undersea cable to the mainland :)

Almost fell for it until you mentioned transaction authentication!

That's unfortunate :/

If the person you're buying from has an AIB bank account you could just deposit through your local AIB bank with their account number.

Haha funny that was sharing that as I would've done it myself. 
I actually saw them film on the way home from the grocery store. You can see the place I live in in a couple of the shots too :)

Just make sure he doesn't get tired of it! :)

What did they talk about? If there's a clip of it, please share it. :)

Would be interesting to read more about how accepting Bitcoin has helped businesses

Awesome!
