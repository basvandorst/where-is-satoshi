The gold standard is actually the best standard we have; it doesn't degrade over time. It's limited. It's practical in relation to value, size and weight. 
And the most important thing is you don't need highly advanced and fragile technology to keep it alive. One major solar storm or whatever global disaster and all is wiped out.
@_date: 2017-09-18 23:56:38
But will this also mean that miners will stop mining and new blocks or transaction will take forever because no one will spend hashpower?
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:49:42
How high are the fees on average when you pay 5€ or 10€?

What if a solar flare or global EMP (same basically) hits the earth and wipes out every computer chip and storage? Then it's all just gone like this - poof.

I have two questions:
1. How to avoid replay attacks after this fork?
2. When exactly will this fork be? 1st November or unknown?

@_date: 2017-10-01 10:03:24


About what time frame? Couple blocks on each chain?
@_date: 2017-09-28 12:02:27
Ye, gold is basically only for hiding in a very deep and secure spot, like a pirate. In the meantime weapons, food and water, and being part of a group, especially military and practical types.

@_date: 2017-09-17 19:20:52
Depends on how high you set the fee. 
But yeah, that's my question too, i thought BTC is not really viable because it takes to long to confirm and als has relative extreme to high fees when paying small amounts..

Ah right, low fee transactions take from 30 minutes to days sbecause of the mempool or something or because chances are lower they get mined because miners mine profitable blocks first or something along those lines, right right.
@_date: 2017-10-03 11:00:53
Oups, don't know why this happened.
So will i get both coins when i hold my BTC in my Electrum wallet, even if it's not a full node?
@_date: 2017-10-03 10:42:16
I wanna claim both coins, will there be 2 coins? How does one claim them if they sit in my ~~Etherium~~ Electrum wallet? 
edit: Don't know why i confused Electrum with Etherium, probably just a minor stroke.
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:01:22
I rather wonder why the price from one second to the next jumped from 38xx to 36xx? That's quite weird. Probably the big boys meddling with the price.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:55:22
But does this mean i will end up with only one chain, 2x chain and coin? God it is so fucking annoying to be stupid.
@_date: 2017-10-03 21:37:35


Sorry, just to clear it up. Why a couple of days? Shouldn't the block be generated in about 10 minutes? So maybe a couple hours tops?
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:06:01
So if i have my coins on either a soft (Electrum) or hard wallet (Bitcoin Core) the only real problem will be replay attacks, because no chain has replay protection?

Kommt drauf an; 
Vorteil bei Kraken: mehr Volumen und genauere Marktpreise und zudem noch niedrige Maker Fees 0.16% (0.26% Taker), dafür ist deren System oft überlastet und ziemlich oft kommen Fehlermeldungen und man muss es paar mal versuchen bis es klappt, ging teilweise soweit, dass ich für ne Stunde nicht traden konnte, und dadurch viel Geld verloren hab, weil jeder verkauft hat und das System ewig überlastet war.
Bitstamp hat 0,25% Fees, aber läuft dafür immer perfekt. Zudem ist es in Luxembourg was mehr Sicherheit für uns Europäer gibt, während Kraken in San Francisco ansässig ist. Nachteil ist, dass Bitstamp vorallem BTC handelt, während man auf Kraken so ziemlich jede Altcoin traden kann.
Also falls du viel tradest, ist vermutlich Kraken besser, da die Fees schon einiges ausmachen.
Falls du weißt wie man Wallet benutzt ignorier den Text unten, hab mich verlesen.
Das sind Exchanges, also Firmen wo du Bitcoins handeln kannst. Die Bitcoins gehören dir aber nicht, da du keinen echten Vollzugriff hast. 
Bitcoin ist ein P2P Netzwerk und du kannst selbst dich daran beteiligen, in dem du Wallets mit Nodes hast, damit bist du Teil des Systems. Aber ein normales Wallet reicht auch, solange nur du Zugriff auf deinen Private Key und Seed hast. 
Lad dir Etherium runter. Erstell dir einen Wallet, speicher die Wallet datei zusätzlich noch auf nem USB Stick, schreib deinen Private Key und Seed auf nen Zettel.
Private Key und Seed geben nur dir Zugriff auf deine Bitcoins bzw. nur damit kannst du deine Wallet Datei wiederherstellen.
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:05:35
So what should one do to avoid replay attacks? I don't really understand how to divert this danger.
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:22:06
Sind aber hohe Kosten, normal haben die meisten Exchanges 0.25% **pro Trade**, was 1,25€ sind? Kraken und Bitstamp z.B.

It's true, i tried to order an S9 yesterday and the only option was about 3 BCH. But the batch in early September you could pay with Lite BTC and BCC it said in the facebook post.
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:45:59
Hab nur negatives von denen gehört. Vorallem bei forks. Also schau, dass du deine Bitcoins beim fork Mitte November in nem Wallet hast (btc core, etherium etc.), weil Coinbase die anscheinend nicht splitten will und dir nur S2X geben wird!
@_date: 2017-10-03 07:41:37
But where does the money actually come from? There is not free money without inflation or any other counter happenings.

I thought you shouldn't move them right AFTER the fork?

Well, i don't really care about all this political shit. I only want to be save and not lose money by ending up with one low valued altcoin, no matter if 2X or NO2X coin will come out as the winner.
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:25:30
Well i read that you can only be sure when you have a full node, otherwise with a soft wallet like Electrum there could be problems..
@_date: 2017-10-01 07:59:42
Can you tell me when this November fork exactly will happen?
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:32:29
Well first you need basic security, then you can start building systems.
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:34:42
So i just have to run Bitcoin Core (NO2X client) and another client which supports 2X and copy datadir and wallet.dat?
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:01:24
Is there a way to know when exactly the fork will be? Like day and hour?

What if there is a keylogger, this would reveal it right? 


But this wouldn't be a problem if the address was under my control? Is this even possible, or can't i create the same address under the 2nd chain, because it is random when i create a wallet or someone else took it by chance... or would i have to create this address prior to the split in order to have it on both chains?


I send my BTC to an Electrum address. Send those BTC to Bitcoin Core couple days before the fork to be sure. Let them sit until after the fork. Open the 2x chain by copying the wallet to a 2x client. Then i send it back to Electrum so no one can replay attack it and from there i can send cash them or hold them or put the on an exchange or whatever.
I thought i have to do soem nLockTime or RBF to chainsplit? That's what LukeJr said.

yes
