How would I do that? I talked with support they said it doesn't work.

This picture describes everything. Should have posted it instead of explaining how I feel, because this shows it beautifully. haha

How do you buy bitcoins with circle though? The only option I get is add money.
@_date: 2015-11-03 22:51:28
At least 3 days rather than 5. 
They can also instantly withdraw money from my debit card, but they don't use those. If I can't find a better option I'll just sign up for a credit card, but I also heard Coinbase can close your account whenever they feel like it.

Almost impossible for you to get bitcoins today.
Only way is if you have a wallet ready and some guy who trusts you sends you 1 bitcoin and you pay him.

that's not how currency works, but ok

Do you even understand what price stabilization is before laughing? Yes, bitcoins went up from $100 to $1100, but it also went **down** from $1100 to $200. For almost 1.5 years it has been moving from $180-$500 ; hence some what stabilizing. Also, a 5 cent to 1 dollar is a 2000% move I agree, but it becomes harder for price to increase that much as the time goes by. Hence, now the price is increasing and decreasing anywhere from 100-300% 
* All you are bringing up here is numbers without even a clue of what the numbers mean, so you're hilarious. 
* Will pm you in 20 years just to show you that you won't turn 100k usd worth of bitcoins as of (11/14/2015) to 2million usd worth of bitcoins.

I tried setting up a wallet, but it only lets me setup a bitcoin wallet and not a usd one. Not sure how you are doing this.

What CEO lol? It's now $378

Leave him be he is a mathematical genius of some sort and can also predict the future with his percentage calculations *sarcasm*.

You need an offline wallet to store that much. If the government doesn't intervene with how bitcoin is going, then price will definitely increase. Just to get 1 million usd price would need to go x10 which seems possible. To go beyond your first million is somewhat "harder" as you need the price to go 20x-50x. 1 bitcoin = $2000 is way too much, but possible.

My other option was to find people who sell bitcoin within 3 days or less or getting a credit card. Seems I'll just get a credit card for instant buy. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:20:32
It just went up to $400 again WTF. I am mind blown I won't look the price anymore and wait.

I'm from Colorado, but I'll contact support and hope I get another guy.

Coinbase will take 4-5 days.
