I don't understand why you post this stuff with no evidence...  How am I supposed to know which is the scam, this app or you?
@_date: 2015-12-18 04:07:43
Thanks!  I guess now it's too late to turn back!

That's some Farrari at $30m!

In general, if you want to be able to move a large amount of money, and also keep a large amount of money safe, you need to deal with big organizations. And you need to abide by local rules.  Neither of these things is particularly prevalent in the bitcoin world.

Uh, so, I agree that if you assume use of bitcoin eliminates all that a bank does, you can make the clear and strong argument that bitcoin is much lower impact. And Hass McCook has very articulately done so. I don't make that assumption. Much of what goes on in those buildings is not just processing transactions. (communication, negotiation, group decision making, etc.). I don't understand how all that just goes away if we use bitcoin. For my use, I am thinking of bitcoin as a transaction processing system. And so my cursory searching looked at that. To perform a credit card transaction vs. a bitcoin transaction, that is what I am comparing. I don't frequently use cash, and so I don't frequently go to an ATM (though I do find it nice that there are many of them all over the place when I need cash for some reason).

I get that bitcoin is different. For me, I don't have any use for it except maybe as a form of payment and "currency".
@_date: 2016-12-09 15:59:23
Yes, part of it is how we generate. But the other part is how much we use.

I don't claim to have done primary original research. I claimed to doing cursory searching. Perhaps you could do that too, as I don't think you would believe anything I would say anyway. I would be happy if someone could/would do some good research and get real numbers, with methodology and neutrality and all that!
@_date: 2016-12-09 15:57:34
Good luck with that.
@_date: 2016-12-10 02:57:16
In both carbon and in the value of the transactions... Perhaps you can link to some analysis? I would be happy if someone could convince me that bitcoin is lower impact, but that is not what I have read so far.
@_date: 2016-12-09 16:03:20
I don't see any effort here to actually analyze, like the people who wrote the articles he linked to. No numbers at all. Just vaguely casting doubt on those. I guess if you assume that you won't have to have banks at all, then you can include the energy associated with the physical banks. I don't assume that.
@_date: 2016-12-09 15:58:59
Uh...  Then divide by the value of the transaction volume.
@_date: 2016-12-10 02:58:55
Please link to some robust analysis?
@_date: 2016-12-10 02:58:16
Link to clear/robust analysis?
@_date: 2019-06-15 03:33:25
So, one thing wrong with this is that you aren't from the future. And the other thing that is wrong with this is that bitcoin is bad for the environment and is only going to get worse. Please stop lying

Gold has some very important and valuable properties.  It is non-reactive/corrosive.  It is heavy.  It is beautiful and shiny.  You can use a very thin (like a molecule or two) sheet to cover something.  You can combine it with many things to make it attain other properties.  It has also been around for many millenia, and will likely survive and retain it's value through any possible changes in our society.  Bitcoin is only has value because a relatively few people value it's utility and understand it.  The twit who tweeted this clearly has a vested interest in having people believe it, and 'referenced in the media' most likely refers to a reddit post, a bitcoin related press release, or some media outlet of ill repute trying to get attention by publishing something pretty outrageous.  All that said, I guess if I was in greece, and I was somehow able to withdraw some euro, and I somehow knew which bitcoin sites were safe, I might just move some of my currency into bitcoin.  Just because I would be pissed at the EU and I would not want to have to protect a gold stash...  But I would still probably try to keep most of my euros and try to get some dollars somehow.

Not supporting something is not the same as wanting to kill it. Some parts of each of those groups are supporting it. Most aren't. Just like any new thing.

It's not a currency. When someone uses a condo to launder the money, it's the condo. When someone uses a car to launder the money, it's the car. When someone uses bitcoin to launder money, it's bitcoin. It's not a currency, it's an asset that is hard to trace.

I have a new thing to buy when I get my time machine finished!  Apple stock from 2000, and bitcoin from 2010!
@_date: 2016-10-08 21:42:02
Seems like these posts should provide at least some evidence.

Seems pretty amazing to have an article largely about 2 former Olympians and not mention the Olympics or their sport!
