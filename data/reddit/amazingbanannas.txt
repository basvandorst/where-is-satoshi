This is getting pretty brave, you want me to get you a Guy Fawkes mask and a fedora to go with your pseudo-vigilantism?

Seems legitimate

Of course, what else could I possibly mean?

Naturally, it's beautiful. However technologically we are years behind, and politically it's a whole another story.

Make sure you engage in some of the other pleasures Amsterdam has to offer while you're there?

I refuse to accept that the Matrix had two sequels. The first was so fucking kick ass and then the last two were just plain bad

Apple is on the warpath against Bitcoin on their devices since it's a payment method which operates outside of their 'walled garden' ecosystem

Except Amazon doesn't sell in Australia

This is a nice script, it could be totally awesome on a site with BTC payment. I would tip you but buying BTC in my country is a pain in the dick
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:30:33
I doubt it will for a while to be honest.

Actually when referring to Pot, OG means 'ocean grown'

Noice. Do I have to head down to a local bank and deposit monies? 
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:06:36
We don't really have anything comparative. We can still shop online, we just don't have a big easy to use collective store like Amazon, instead we have different, specific sites. Some items ship internationally, I got my headphones shipped from Amazon. We are a relatively small population compared to the UK and US, however I think with the growth of the company they will expand to smaller markets such as Australia. And to rub it in, buying Bitcoin is a pain in the ass. I have to sign up to some shady site and head down to my local bank and put money in their account. Not as easy as a simple online bank transfer
