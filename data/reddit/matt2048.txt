If you're mining for a level of profit, one of the newer ASICs are the only real option. You'll also probably need a fair few to make it viable, as smaller miners have quite a disadvantage.
However, if you are mining for fun, I believe you can get older ASICs relatively cheaply, but they won't be very efficient.
Also, free power for you or not, they will use a lot of electricity that someone will be paying for, make sure your parents cool with it first.

I would suggest looking into ethereum mining. There is still some money to be made there. But as mentioned, the electricity costs will take a big chunk out of any small profit

You're a bit late on GPU mining, ASICs are the only option these days, and even those won't do much for you unless you have a few dozen of them.

For a company with the right software and ties to exchanges they could just find the bitcoin you initially bought with fiat then follow the output trail. With enough data the pseudo anonymity is broken, and they have a blockchain full of it.

I'm not the one with the tools to do the tracking nor the one who cares if you want to continue arguing that point, but bitcoin wasn't made to be a fully anonymous currency and so it has that protocol weakness.

Several companies are developing software to do large scale transaction  analysis and make the tracking of money flow easier. I'm not sure whether any of these are open source or publicly available, but they are being actively developed.

Bitcoin itself though is very traceable.

companies like  can follow bitcoin money flow with pretty high accuracy and if the bitcoin was bought or sold through any exchange   that complies with KYC/AML then they will have the details of who initially bought the coin and who sold them.
