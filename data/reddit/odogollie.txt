I agree, they should have some start screen that says, Do you know how Bitcoin works? if not please read this before use... or something like that. I have run into far too many people that think Bitcoin is a scam or unsafe. It really bothers me how the general media portrays Bitcoin as a whole...

I guess thats a good point but I think if someone wants to get bitcoin they should do a little research first. Enough to understand how to make transactions and what not.

They are very good when it comes to technology, I'm not sure why they had a problem with Bitcoin...

He moved the bitcoin to his own wallet on his phone. It was his own fault for not understanding what the miners fee is and that its good to pay it so you can transact faster.

You would have to create an openmap account and remove it that way, its not terrible difficult to do.

[Zinc Save]( can be used to buy stuff with Bitcoin on Amazon!

Well the problem was that he didn't pay the miners fee that's why it took so long, I ran into that problem recently
