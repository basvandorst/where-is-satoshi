This is awesome. Where can I buy it? You custom made it?

Crap. Was hoping for it to pull back a little and get in more but seems this will just keep going up...

First part is answered but what on earth do you mean on that second paragraph? You say you don't have time for crypto but want to get in?

...and it took 3-5 business days to send it to somebody else, and you had to pay fees to a bank to store your money, etc...

Agreed. Some big whales will try to cash out soon and as usual some panic follows. But I am confident it will remain higher than before

It is a target, they are not saying that is what will happen. An experienced trader would exit the position at the sign of a pull back and take the profit. If it goes past the target they would just get back into the game or stay in and gain some more. 
A newbie would just get out and realize some days later he missed it kept going on higher while waiting for the next article.

Every seller has slightly different requirements for the transaction. Whether you can use the atm or teller depends on the proof you need to provide to the seller. I suggest you ask the seller when initiating the transaction. 
Once you provide proof of deposit most top sellers release it immediately. LB maintains the amount in a type of escrow. 
I loved how fast it is to acquire and in my case had to provide images of the receipt with some extra text and a photo of me and the receipt to match my ID.

***Good Guy Bitfinex*** This is great news. Means I can keep my btc in the exchange and quickly dump that trashy new coin
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:08:06
Agree with this. Spread the risk, and always keep some fiat on the account. You never know when everything suddenly falls in price and you don't have anything to buy more.

Coinbase has shitty customer support and close accounts upon slightest shady activity of the users detected (ie buying from dark markets). For the 200k guy I haven't seen all the proof of what he is claiming, there may be more than what is known. 
In any case, whatever you do, get your coins out of Coinbase once you acquire them.
