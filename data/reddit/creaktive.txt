It is a pyramid. But I have to admit this is actually brilliant.

Cool! I’ve felt I could memorize mine when writing it down, but never got around to it... will try for real now, thanks for the inspiration!

Convenience is inversely proportional to security ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Technically it almost always works over radio waves. Hard to imagine anyone using an Ethernet cable nowadays;)

I do mine Monero on my MacBook Pro when it’s idle. It is capable of reaching 100H/s when I’m not using  the computer. And maximal power consumption is 25W. Except I’m not a wishful thinker enough to join a pyramid pool ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Seriously, why?

Check out minerdesk, they have a software that benchmarks your system and automatically selects the most profitable algorithm to mine. 
P.S. - I’m not affiliated to minerdesk, and I gain nothing with referrals.

In this case every single meme is “aware”. Every single bacteria or virus. The universe doesn’t give a flying fuck, man.

I would boot a LiveCD distro and use Linux to recover the valuable files. Check

tl;dr: did you change it already?
Nothing, I repeat, NOTHING is secure. It’s just a matter of resources someone is willing to employ in order to break it. For instance, hardware wallet is “secure” because it would take at least weeks to crack it in a bleeding-edge equipped lab. Now, you’re basically saying that the difficulty to crack your wallet just dropped several orders of magnitude. It is a very easy prey now, in comparison to what it was when no one except you knew the 12 words.

I didn’t say this thing is bad. On the contrary!

What’s the difference from what chirp.io does?
