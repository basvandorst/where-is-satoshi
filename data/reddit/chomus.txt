I think this is how Bitcoin catches fire.  Tipping people who know nothing about bitcoin.. they don't even have to have a wallet setup ahead of time.  
Someone asks "What's bitcoin?" then someone tips them, BOOM! "You have bitcoin!"
It's working well on Twitter.. I hope they can get Facebook working soon.  I think it will catch on quickly.

I don't care much for her fiction (or any fiction for that matter), but I loved The Virtue of Selfishness and Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal.  Well worth the read.

How many times do we have to go over this?  Taking social security was NOT hypocritical.  The money was first stolen from her.  There is nothing wrong with taking it back. 
I despise social security as well and you better believe I will attempt to take back every penny I involuntarily put into it.

it's a 7 day chart. i just refreshed and the spike is no longer there.  i can only find it in Bitshares PTS.  maybe it was just some kind of error somewhere.

Have you read The Virtue of Selfishness?   I say this because you have not yet even attempted to debate the ideology, you've only thrown insults at her character.

lol I can't get high on bitcoin though.
but seriously, I wish someone would prove me wrong.  bitcoin threatens the power of too many authoritarians in this world.  they won't go down without a fight.

First the banks and now paypal?  This has to be great news for bitcoin.  Imagine if the entire industry starts promoting it.

threaten to arrest/imprison/fine any business owner caught accepting the currency.  
All i'm saying is, they won't bother going after individuals, they'll hit businesses and that's all they'll need to do.

The state does control that.  
Pure democracy is a terrifying prospect.

"By a continuing process of inflation, government can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens."
I'm already about as familiar with Keynes as I'd ever want to be.  Thanks though.

Your mistrust of "rich people" would be much more appropriately directed toward the state.




It's not the rich who would force you to use a particular currency.  It would be the state.  See legal tender laws.

No one said she was forced to take it. I think you misread FixPUNK's statement.

FX is the largest market in the world.  I feel like this could tap into that.

I know he was paraphrasing Lenin.  He perfectly described the evil that is inflation, yet he was not opposed to monetary expansion.


So he was Lenin Light?  Diet Lenin?

The quote is Keynes himself.  How do you not know this?
"Keynes argued that the solution to the Great Depression was to stimulate the economy ("inducement to invest") through some combination of two approaches:  A reduction in interest rates (monetary policy), and Government investment in infrastructure (fiscal policy)."
So dicking with interest rates and throwing tons of stolen money around isn't the use of monetary levers?

This.  The biggest advocates of regulation are often the entrenched interests who can afford to have a "compliance" department.

Wait a minute, when did we stop practicing keynesianism?
and I'm no gold bug, but this chart correlates much more closely to when we went off the gold standard.

I really love these, but I wish they'd print an unlimited number of them and lower the price.  I'd buy a ton.

I'm afraid this is exactly what will happen.  Control freaks DO NOT like to let go and the people are too complacent to insist on liberty.

My wallet and I both hope you are right.

sure they have:  Liberty Reserve, the link between Dwolla &lt;-&gt; Mt. Gox.. this stuff will continue.  They are chopping off the branches before they hit the trunk.  I'd bet good money the Feds are working on an official legal case against cryptocurrency.  Legal tender laws exist for a reason.  Bitcoin threatens the foundation of government power around the world.  It will be made illegal to possess and/or to buy and sell with.  But, as we all know, they can't destroy it.  We'll see where it goes from there.
@_date: 2013-05-29 15:52:07
I agree and i think it will be exciting to watch the value of the coin rise despite illegality.
