Can you explain what you mean by "hard fork"? 
Do you mean that the bitcoin core developers don't want to increase the size so other developers would have to create their own project and split the blockchain?

It's true I don't focus all of my attention on bitcoin. I do care about it's success. And I do own some bitcoins.  I just have been hearing a lot about this particular issue a lot lately. More so than a lot of other past issues.

Not much.  Was there something wrong with my question or something?

I'm from tennessee. Where cival liberties still exist for the most part.
The police can't stop you on the street and fondle you without charges. 
No one tries to legislate how big your soda cup can be. 
Our police force is more like a peace keeping organization and less like the "7th largest army in the world"
Oh and not only the criminals are allowed to own firearms.
edit- crazy fingers: "Probably because it is so crowded and expensive." Thats another good reason.

I Could have sworn I had used google once before to convert BTC and USD. "1 USD in BTC" But I just tried and it didn't work.
Edit - I am either loosing my mind or google did at one time convert BTC. I would like to hear google's response to this.

Thats the real answer. It comes with any big government eventually.

You would have to pay me a lot more than that to step foot in New York.
I like the idea however.

It would be nice if we lived in a free world but we don't. Regulation can hurt bitcoin in its current state. If not directly then indirectly. You would be foolish to think otherwise.
One day perhaps, when bitcoin has more mainstream adoption, government interference will have a much smaller affect. But for the moment, that isn't the case.
