bithumb price is not accessable for foreigners, because of that it should be excluded.

kraken has the same rate as bitcoin.de, and i wonder why.
maybe kraken follows bitcoin.de because they are both connected to fidor bank.

it has no battery.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:36:56
yes signing a message is legit to test it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:50:39

trezor made a tool to claim your coins which are on a trezor.

transfered everything to viabtc and dumped every single BTH for a very good price, and you see with every block mined and every BCH flowing into exchanges price falls.

it´s an old bitcoin breadwallet!
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:40:16
Yes sir!
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:54:53
what the fuck are you telling? With segwit you get up to 1.7MB blocks and with Segwit2x you can double it. so it will nearly be 4MB. But not 8MB or even an average tx size of 1.7MB!
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:27:04
why not use this: 
but before you have to update here: 
Then you can send directly to an exchange address
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:56:54
no not to 4MB, segwit will make 1.7 MB possible but not by raising blocksize.
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:05:18
how much have you invested?
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:29:29
OK thats not that terrible, look forward, 5k is not a life changing amount.
@_date: 2019-02-03 07:22:46
No, bitcoin is decentralized. So exchanges and environment services should also add more decentralizeness. That's the way to go.

With 5% it is 20x slower, so it would need 40 weeks to find 2016 blocks.

wasnt there the possibilty to import a wallet file in blockchain.info?
@_date: 2017-06-29 18:46:21
lost forever... and when there is a chance to recover those coins bitcoin becomes worthless in the same moment.
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:29:00
you left dust:
