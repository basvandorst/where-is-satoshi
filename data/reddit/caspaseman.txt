I'm just very happy I bought my 315 shares this morning when they were only 0.0038! Talk about return of investment... Very curious if this business will succeed. I'll keep my money in for the long run.

I know this, but not everybody is set up to send/receive bitcoin directly. For my friends in Argentina, I used Localbitcoins to deposit money directly into their account. Currently, another friend of mine is receiving payments in bitcoin. He didn't know how to convert this to pesos to pay his rent, so I also set him up with Localbitcoin. This works well enough, but it's still a bit of a hurdle.

I suspect this is a self-published novel through Amazon? The writing is, indeed, appalling.

It's the logical next step. So far, to transfer money to Argentina, I've used Local Bitcoins. That works very well, but it's easier if it can be done directly through a bank.

Bitcoin is the middle man, in this scenario. Hodling is all fun and games, but most people just need to pay rent. Buying and selling bitcoin is a big hurdle for many. For me, Localbitcoin with bank transfer has worked great, but many people would still trust a bank more for their foreign transactions.

The money doesn't need to flow in. It's enough for only a fraction of one BTC to be sold for 1M/BTC  (say 0.001 BTC for $1000; repeatedly bought and sold) to raise the price of 1 BTC to $1M; as long as the supply is low and the demand is high. Most BTC are never traded, many have even been removed from circulation altogether. As long as nobody is willing to sell their BTC for less than $1M and some are willing to buy even fractions of BTC for that rate, the price will go there.

Of course! As would most people currently in Bitcoin, most would probably sell earlier. And thus, it fractionates. Currently, though, the price heavily depends on the value of shorts and longs. Longs now sell for about $23K.

Early last year, my colleagues were discussing how to invest their money. I said 'buy Bitcoin; it's cheap now at €360!'. They said 'no, no, Bitcoin is having huge technical difficulties, it's too risky'. Oh well, their loss.
