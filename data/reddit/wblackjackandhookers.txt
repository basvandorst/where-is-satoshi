Bitcoin Charities are great idea.  I hope to see more transparency in the charity space.  Always been offended when I hear the numbers about 10-25% of actual donations going towards the intended cause, and the rest going into the pockets of the charity board members or to their supposed "overhead expenses".

Bali Tokyo New York San Diego LA Secret Bitcoin Island Bahamas, etc.  Easy to spend money when you spend most of your time on "Company Retreats" and team building exercises.

"Screw you guys, I'm gonna start my own automated tipping service... with Bitcoin, and blackjack, and hookers." 
Now, how do you get the WSJ to use ProTip instead of a stupid paywall?  
I would rather donate based on the amount of time I spend on their site than pay to get in.  Revolutionary thinking guys.  Nice work.
