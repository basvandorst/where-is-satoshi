I told you to look up AML. You limit cash withradal, monitor account to flag frequent input of cash, use algorithm that detect topical money laundering schemes by tracing accounts activities... 
All of that is public knowlege, deployed and part of normal operations in banks worldwide. And if you're found guilty, there are list emitted by governments, and bank have dedicated software that will block any payment from/to one of these sanctioned entities.  
There are even adverse media lists that are compiled to flag all peoples that appears in the medias for financial crimes. Depending on its risk tolerance, a bank can put those peoples on its list. 
Beside, ok you have an ecosystem, but you can also forbid companies to accept bitcoin for payments, and with all the KYC and AML mechanism that exist right now, well,... how would they sell their bitcoin to get raw materials?
They'd be restricted to bitcoin-using companies? Not a lot of companies would put up with that...

They can do it if they want. Nothing is stopping them. 
There are quite a few agreement that you have to follow to use the SWIFT network, and if all major players want to ban bitcoin, they can add a new one. 
Do you know about sanction lists? No? Look up how AML works. 


Don't you see a small issue there? Bitcoin mining uses an HUMONGOUS amount of power and is mostly done in big farm. 
China SEEMS to want to actually pull out of bitcoin mining... or is doing its annual pump and dump, with a politician getting very rich by publishing an alarmist "leak" every year.

They can simply forbid selling bitcoin for money, and penalize banks that accept that money. They'd start by inceasing KYC to unreasonable level, slap hight taxes to fight adoption, and then forbid it entirely. It wouldn't outright kill bitcoin, but it would sink the value to... very, very low levels.

The process is probably automated, and run algorithm to detect risky behaviours.
They probably don't know themselves why they blocked you.

Bitcoin can work (and probably will work). The blockchain concept will definitively have a long lasting impact too.
What's bullshit is the tyranny built on debt narrative.
Those peoples don't understand what  a currency is. If you want to "opt out of this debt crazed system" invest in any commodity or in any company. Bitcoin is just another commodity (with extremely interesting properties might I add).

... man the banking system is planning on making big money with bitcoin and the blockchain. It's going to be a very hot topic on SIBOS this year.

Of course they can. Money is just paper changing hand, and printing money only affect paper.
If interest rates are super low, that's for a reason. If bitcoin was mature its value would stagnate. Look at the price of gold.

Yes, sure, we ignore how the financial market works. /s
Those debt free countries like Russia and China are really showing us the way to go /s

... it's kind of hillarious that some peoples didn't see this coming. 
Aml for bitcoin is coming and the time you'll worry about where a bitcoin comes from is soon.

... They are assigning value to dollars because the American government, who control it, also control the largest economy in the world and the biggest army in the world, and is therefore able to deliver goods to back its value.
Bitcoin is only scarce if you don't consider other currency. If this issue doesn't solve itself, it may very well go to 0 with a massive exodus to another blockchain.
