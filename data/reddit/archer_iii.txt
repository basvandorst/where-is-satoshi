That's how it's called. If I have zero bitcoin right now and it becomes the reserve currency with a crazy value I will lose a lot in terms of relative net worth in comparison with coiners. Isn't that worse off?
In a zero sum game, there are people that are better off (early adopters) and worse off (late adopters). What incentive is there for the late adopters to adopt the system? None. So it is not a question of awareness, it is just a question of having a power above the people to arbitrarily decide that from now on all transactions will be in BTC. 
BTC is like a pyramid scheme, now all you need is to get the last layer of the pyramid (the losers) agree to play the game, good luck with that.

Funnily I am also teaching physics, the guy probably posted examples that are too complex, but a simple analogy of beauty and simplicity is nature is: newtonian mechanics is right (simple, force, mass, acceleration) and relativity theory is wrong (space-time coupling, proper time, length contraction, invariance of speed of light, etc.)

Sadly when the fiat bubble pops the institutions will want to be recapitalized with Bitconnect cash coins, not BTC...

Great article! Just replace BTC by Doge

One of the key assumptions is: why BTC versus another goverment based crypto, or vs another coin. Everything is open source, if the countries were to team up with a global currency (which they won't, game theory 101, every country wants to have their own monetary policy), what would prevent them from creating an official worldcoin backed by the UN? Why would governments of the world depend on mining pools that could collude and make a 51% attack, which can never be avoided since big players could collude. 
Face it, you are part of a zero sum game, your only hope is that 98% of the population would accept to voluntarily transition to BTC to be worse off, to bail out the 2% of the population that has BTC. I really see that happen, ppl love to be voluntarily worse off, specially when they don't benefit from the new technology over existing cards and wireless payments

You are not forced to use your bank to make transfers. Other options like Western Union, Paypal, etc. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 23:23:48
Maybe I have trouble in math:
" If $90,000 are transferred using the traditional banking method, users can be charged as much as $45 by the banks  
 This is in stark contrast against Bitcoin payments. According to [data from Earn.com](  which talks of the recommended fee is 8 satoshis per byte, which is  roughly 75 cents for a transaction worth $90,000. This means that  traditional fiat transactions can be up to 6000 times costlier than a  Bitcoin transaction!  "
$0.75x6000=$4,500 , not $45
It is only a x100 factor, but that's ok

I completely agree. You know what we should do: reset the process and give free btc fractions to everyone in the world. This would definitely foster adoption. We could create a BTC 2 the same way, and redistribute all the cards to everyone. That would free us from the slavery of banks and help the middle class!
@_date: 2019-11-27 16:24:16
How do you reconcile that narrative with the "mass adoption" narrative that says that mass adoption will occur because even tech illiterate people will use custodian services? 
Will they do that until some learn an expensive lesson and stop?

yes 1.7% fee is reasonable. It is about the same as a credit card fee.
@_date: 2019-01-21 00:08:57
It is the market cap, so it is the exact figure. I am sure that if Satoshi was liquidating his millions of BTC the price would not change at all. In fact this morning I created the Daddycoin DDC, which is limited in numbers. There will be only 1 billion DDC ever. I sold one to my 6 year old son for 25 cents today, so the marketcap of DDC is 250 million.

I am not sure what the secret is, but to make things more convenient for the folks at school I also created the DTH that is adjusted to match 1 USD always. You give me one buck, I give you a DTH.

False, no guarantees of return indeed.
