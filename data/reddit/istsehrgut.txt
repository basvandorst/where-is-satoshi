what will you do with your internet connection when websites start blocking users with adblocks on?

Could there ever be a way to setup recurring billing without using a third party? Maybe in the btc core wallet we could have a scheduled send option?

Somebody very nice contributed. Thank you whoever you are internet stranger!

If you're tipping less than $5 you're spamming wherever you are IMO.  It all seems quite childish handing pennies out (which seems to predominately be the case).  Honestly, if someone came up to you on the street and randomly wanted to give you three pennies, you would think they were up to something nefarious, or at very least mentally challenged.
I get that it is all about exposure by making people question wtf just happened, but as others in this thread have pointed out... it's not worth their time and the next time they won't even bother to give it a second look.
Just my $5.00.

It's only 'no' if you don't take mining seriously, IMO. Amateur wanna-be miners take a job that is commission/effort based and then complain when they realize it takes work(investment) to accommodate your desire for income.
No you fools, your raspberry pi and a USB hub full of ASIC won't net you anything.  Want to put some effort into sourcing a decent electricity rate and hardware to match the current difficulty demand? You're going to have a ROI at the current BTC price.
@_date: 2014-11-15 07:43:50
sounds like the mods of agree with you...
you're disillusioned to the value a no monies worth of a tip that the majority of people outside of the BTC sphere don't understand has. It makes more sense for them to put a few pennies of fiat in a baggy to jingle around if they really want something to play and move back and forth etc.  It's stacking worthlessness on top of perceived worthlessness.
@_date: 2014-11-12 01:22:07
I second this.

FYI some of your bit.ly links are being flagged as spam.  If you're doing it for tracking purposes, relying on a bit.ly is the wrong answer.

Oh I didn't even think of that. Hopefully Walmart is open and I can swing in and get them a toaster and family sized pack of gum instead. Would you care for this now useless private key?  
  
*edit*  
Apologies for the sarcasm, allow me to try again:  I did actually put some thought into the two family members who will be receiving these in a few hours. Both of them know that I "bitcoin" and have asked me various questions about why and how the protocol works, how it gets value, etc. So this to me was a good opportunity to let them get their hands on some and make it real for them rather than just something talked about and teach them about different types of storage.  
I understand, as do they, that they are not accepted everywhere and I fully anticipate and encourage them to either put the effort in to going beyond what we've talked about and finding ways to spend them (via gyft, newegg, ..., ...) or sticking it in their safes and letting it sit for a good while until their curiosity is peaked or BTC has gone to the moon and they are now ten thousandaires. One person receiving in particular is interested in it's investment value.
@_date: 2014-12-25 16:32:39
Luckily they are going to the two family members who do have a clue.

The difference here is that the musician is asking for something that he already knows has value and will buy him a couple cheeseburgers at the end of the day. He doesn't need to question what you just threw into his hat, or be convinced to figure it out; he knows, and all he has to do is shove it in his pocket and he's done what he set out to do.
All I would really like to see is that we are introducing BTC tips tastefully and with clear intent to show appreciation in the form of a new currency that will take a bit of time to learn the value of, which is clearly what's not being done if users are being banned from subreddits.  (not to say everyone is doing it wrong, but this whole thread seems to be almost trying to brag about being banned because of some users doing their "tipping duty.")

For even more reference, Paypal admits that Mega has been upstanding and are not doing anything against Paypals terms.
The pressure comes via Visa and MasterCard who pressured PayPal to cease providing payment services to MEGA. Visa/MC were apparently pressured by Senator Leahy (Vermont, Chair Senate Judiciary Committee) who might* have ties with the MPAA and others who are overall showing hostility towards end-to-end encryption services run by smaller business without money to bribe and lobby.

Paypal is useful until it's not, basically.
