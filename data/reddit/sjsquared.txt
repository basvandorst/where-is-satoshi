"Charles Stuart University have offered a Master
+//                course in the subject of Programming Supercomputers.
+//                It is a hands on course and these programs are
+//                part of the labs and quizzes and exam.  
+//                We are working on Tulip, the fastest computer in
+//                Australia."

I don't doubt that, but video footage of this nature is interesting nonetheless; just the existence of the course is interesting.

Interesting that the university that Craig was associated with (at some point?) had him as offering a supercomputing 'masterclass' which specifically mentioned his supercomputer:

Here's some slides from that class: 
Ok I get that maybe the supercomputer doesn't exist, but how exactly do you offer up a class with 'access to the Tulip supercomputer' with no one noticing?

Video footage of SSH session to Tulip supercomputer?

I don't know what a cat has to provide on this but it is perhaps as useful as any communication so-far involving the foundation.
Rest in peace.

The website went down for about a week or two; then the website came back up without the forums.
It's been a tid for tat relationship with the foundation, but two-three weeks signals the death of something that is supposed to be opensource.

Considering the hardware cost is likely to be much lower at this point, wouldn't it basically mean you're just competing in a lottery?
What I mean in saying that is that as it would basically cost 'nothing' to run a miner at home then a lot more people would be doing it?

Also, in the example of solar wouldn't it actually be completely free on any sunny day (assuming maintenance/cleaning issues are autonomous at that point in time?)

Could just be a case of a decentralized solution taking over from all of the centralized exchanges and darknet markets.

Why you'd use an infected notebook in the first place is questionable, but to each their own. It doesn't take very long to reformat a system nowadays. Whoever is operating the trojan could presumably see this post and then just encrypt all of your files for a ransom of 20BTC.
Use your mobile phone (if you have one).

Read plenty on bitcointalk and it is possible to make some profit from certain coins. However, absent of any real world usage for altcoins it seems that many of them are manipulated towards pump and dumps.
I use poloniex and find it to be quite good; never had many issues with them. As always don't be the person that doesn't use 2FA.
