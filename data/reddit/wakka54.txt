Who pays for the cops to keep people from using the public parks and roads they refused to pay for? Your idea has major flaws.

Bitcoin has a vast amount of wealth concentrated with a few people, and all it takes for the populace to get revenge is to start using any other coin. Brand power won't overcome the slightest pressure to jump to a coin that benefits that person. People are selfish and that will spell Bitcoins doom in time.

Maybe it is. It's always true after all. Everyone has doubled their profit on every investment, at all times. e.g. If you go from $9000 to $8000, at some point it must have passed $8500, therefore your profit of -500 doubled. You just take the total change, divide it by two, find where it passed that point on the chart, then double it.

I have 48 bitcoin on a paper wallet publically accessible on several of my websites, and a long password I have solidly memorized in my brain. Hardware wallets are a false sense of security and a liability.

This is a sarcastic satire of a Bitcoin fork, and has nothing to do with actual Apple stuff, for everyone else who is confused.

Because it makes a cool video.
Because it's ridiculous to see so much money at once.
Because it goes viral and brings attention to the pain and suffering of the Venezuelan people under hyperinflation and right now. They government and leader have reached a level of total corruption rarely seen in history. This is what can happen. Millions live in a daily hell and it's new and not their fault. But what can be done? They're held hostage by an Army and no other Army is ready to die to right the wrong.

Money doesn't exist. People exist. Guns exist. The people with the most guns are the government. Your question is just how do you make people do things. Same as always, threaten to kill them, and do, stategically, until the slaves line up.
@_date: 2018-09-05 16:28:01
The context is Venezuela and a bare minimum of current events awareness.

There's not really an end in sight. Dictators have been known to hold on to power for decades. They really have no choice - they and all their buddies would get the death sentence if they let go of power.

The data can be compressed by following a pattern, you don't have to type every integer from 1 to a billion to communicate that you're checking those, for exampole

Oh I get it. So basically the whole set of guesses is unique to each wallet. So everyone is trying to guess the winner from a unique set, not a universal set. Thanks.

my question is my baby and it make a little sense

You're hung up on pedantics. If you're obsessed with correcting the grammar of my question feel free but it's not what I'm asking so have fun.
Mining works via guessing at a cryptographically secured piece of data.
That's a task that can be parallelized.
As other people have said, mining pools apparently can do this.
If you don't think coordinating parallel work by sharing information helps each member of a group compared to individuals outside the group, then read up on the  . More info = better probability guesses.
@_date: 2018-10-06 00:22:40
"How do they find this number? By guessing at random. " - 
Well obviously I understand that much so are you saying coindesk is wrong? 
Or was my phrasing of my question wrong in that it didn't capture the "guessing" mechanic they're writing about there? Are you saying its impossible/highly improbable for two miners to "guess" (in coindesks sense of the word) the same thing and thus the later one is wasting their computer time on that guess?
I don't understand how the size of a 256-bit number is relevant to the scenario of miners guessing at random and falling upon the same thing someone else already checked (so they either wasted their time on a loser or wasted their time on a already claimed winner) - obviously real miners something guess right on occasion or new bitcoins wouldn't exist.
Edit: No need to reply, someone gave the actual complete answer to my question. I have no idea what you thought I was asking. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 02:32:43
Waiiiiiiit a minute.
How does convolving your address into the block change anything? If the correct guess is 71.453% thru the block, then they could still tell each other how far they are in the block. And if it's in a different spot for every person, how does it guarantee it's somewhere in the block?
If the reward goes to a pool and the pool coordinates who mines which part it would be way more profitable than an individual whos guessing a lot of already tried guesses, no?
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:31:02
God damn you are a dumbass.
@_date: 2018-10-06 00:33:56
That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying coordinating parallel computations doesn't involve a large volume of data. It's basic  from the 1950s
@_date: 2018-10-06 23:09:07


Oh, so there's actually LOTS of winning guesses, you just have to find one of them first to get the bitcoin? Ok that explains why several comments keep saying "there's way more SHA256 numbers than you think". Although they arent really saying much because 1 winner in 10 vs 10 winners in 100 arent that different of concepts.


Ah so I'm right, individual miners are at a disadvantage then. Pool miners have more information in a  sense. People randomly guessing on their own will earn less in the long run.
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:34:15
Yeah that's what I thought I said

It didn't come out of nothing. It came from another user, not the exchange. Yes, the shuffling of coins they do is fractional reserve.
@_date: 2015-07-25 23:27:43
Is there any way to detect that 51% of the miners are working in a secret coalition? Could this corrupt mining already be happening?

3) Subscribers fund the infrastucture building with no property rights. If the price of bitcoin doubled, you bet they'll cancel all the subscriptions that day and use the infrastructure themselves.

You seem misinformed on margin. Margin auto-liquidates your account well before you end up underwater, so it's not a risk for exchanges, nor have any acquired any debt due to offering a margin system..

Coinbase has 0 risk to themselves related to bitcoin prices. They aren't selling anything. Price changes are covered by the market makers with limit orders on the book, the exchange just pairs people for trades. If you buy coin on coinbase you're buying from an unaffiliated person with a limit sell offer in coinbases orderbook.
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:27:09
but isn't a 50 cents (and growing) transaction fee a killer for normal use?
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:56:26
Hard disagree. Gift transactions free on paypal. Bitcoin charges 50 cents. If you're going to pay a premium it better be for something illegal.
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:44:25
Those are seperate things. If you only want to look at the transferring money portion, look at cloud based banks like Ally. They have none of those bills.


Literally not true. Personal payments (which is all bitcoin does) are free with banks. P2P transfers are free. Paypal transfers are free. e-checks are free. 
The only things with fees are fraud-protected transactions like credit card, which isn't comparable to bitcoin, and even then the fees are tiny for common use:
For Transactions &lt; $10:
1.5% + $0.01 for Amazon Payments balance transfers
2.0% + $0.05 for bank account debits
5.0% + $0.05 for credit card
Bitcoin charges $3.68 to send a penny. Obviously one of these systems is fatally flawed.
@_date: 2017-06-21 07:33:49
That is interesting. A miner can make a massive profit almost instantly? Are they just guessing and checking? Is there a smarter way to choose their guesses to make profit more likely? Or is that impossible with the cryptography aspect?
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:23:45


Only on $25+ purchases. Most of my purchases are a $5 sandwich or something. 50c is a 10% fee.

Transaction fees have been going up and up. what makes you think they'll reverse direction?
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:22:08
Are you kidding? I can buy a pack of gum with a dollar bill. With bitcoin the transaction fee alone on that pack of gum is practically a dollar.
@_date: 2017-06-27 11:17:14
There's idiots out there paying 1.5% a trade? Holy shit. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:21:45


This is so factually untrue it's absurd. A bank server requires maybe 0.001 kWh to process a transaction in less than a second.
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:35:12
I don't care if there's fraud protection - im just pointing out that for a 50 cent fee at least paypal gives you *some* benefit. bitcoin just seems like its dumb to use for buying a pack of gum, the fees will add up to rediculous amounts over a year. and if its already that broken, why would it ever succeed?
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:07:55
So then it's even worse. You could leave the heat blasting in a house for an entire two days for less electricity than it takes to process buying a stick of gum. Horrifying and perplexing that anyone believes bitcoin will ever gain adoption.
