I'm thinking about it to get more coins in my wallet I have 0.05and whatever number goes after that and I've never spent a single one because it took me a long time to get there I don't care if I get a few satoshi or micro btc as Kong as I get some. At this point I go to like 20 different faucets to get some.

I think for some stuff bitcoin is ok but for paying rent to an old guy that's your landlord or stuff like that fiat would be best since most people get surpassed by technology at a certain age.or at bitcoin until it catches on more fiat is still good for stuff like that.

I just requested an invite a few days ago it said that there was a long waiting list to join. They didn't give out a date just said keep a look on your inbox for the invite.

Dude, we don't use bitcoin in Mexico or at least not that I know of. I'm not in Mexico at this moment but I suspect that when bitcpin catches up in Mexico it would start in the capital or in Guadalajara.

That's what they meant by picking that domain name.

Sorry for the late reply. how it works is that there is no escrow service so they place order and they give you the address to send btc, but they make a fake message and it instructs you to watch the address in this case it is 13bwT7hk6kssDwALAu7f16pZtFYDufMtsx
it is obviously not my address and yeah that's how it works.

I just thought the community should be aware of a fraudulent buyer on coinpost.com makes purchases and never pays for the items and does not respond to messages sent to him/her either. uses usernames such as qweqwe, testuser123456, and most recently testuser13. Thanks for reading.
