How do I go about double spending it as every time I tried to do that it just said not enough funds even though they are there but just unconfirmed ?

Ok thanks for the help man , I may have to wait as I don't think electrum lets me spend the u confirmed transaction . I read about being able to broadcast somthing from the console ? You wouldn't know anything about that would you as it seems very complicated ?

What can I do then ? I've never had this problem before and I've sent larger amounts without any trouble ?  This is the first time I've ever sent and it came up as 4 inputs if that means anything ?

Ok so I entered the details into that and it came up as transaction succeeded , does this mean it should help push it forward now then ?

I'm sorry guys you've lost me ? I understand about the low fee and it's electrum so I can't spend unconfirmed btc ? Do you have any Ideas how I can either cancel it so I can try sending it again or what should I do ? And can I ask why the first three inputs were ok but the last one wasn't ?

So all I can do is wait for the mean time ? And how would I go about making sure that the fee is high enough as I've never had this problem before and I haven't changed anything from the last time I sent btc

Ok so it seems I got a confirmation so does that mean it's going to go through ?

Woooo :) thanks for help guys I thought I was badly stuck  , what should I do to ensure that I don't run into this problem again ? I know to put the fees up higher but is there anything I can set so I don't have to change it again ?
