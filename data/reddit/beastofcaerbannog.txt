If too much carbon is being emitted through electricity usage, this is the failing of a country and its economic system, not Bitcoin.  If a country thinks it's burning too much carbon, impose a carbon tax. Bitcoin won't care if mining activity decreases: the difficulty will adjust. Either that, or miners will move to cleaner energy.
So, bring on the regulation.  Regulate the emitters of the carbon.

Bisq accepts Revolut, which is essentially a prepaid Mastercard. Transactions are peer-to-peer so only the seller sees who you are.

Theory 1:
Most crypto trading pairs are correlated in the short term, and BCH-whatever is being dumped.
When one of the BCH-\*\*\*\*coins drops hard, triangular arbitrage bots will take advantage of the situation.  If BCH is looking cheap on a BCH-BTC pair relative to the BCH-USD pair, BTC will be dumped to grab the opportunity. You obviously want to hold BCH for the shortest time possible, so you dump the BCH for USD. How the triangle is completed would depend on the strategy.
The overall effect is the BCH drops and causes BTC to drop a bit, but not as much.
Theory 2:
Both of the charlatans that are shilling their respective \*\*\*\*coins are encouraging people to dump BTC for BCH.
Either way, buy the dip.

Looking at HODLFinance, why on earth would I post more than half a bitcoin to get a $1000 loan? Last time I looked I could get $1800 for half a bitcoin.
