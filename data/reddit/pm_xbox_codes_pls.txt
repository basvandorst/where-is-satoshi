Ok what I meant to say is that he has no political experience. He also doesn’t depend on any super pacs, just individual donations. Do me a favor and listen to his podcast with Joe Rogan. I too was skeptical at first, but all you have to do is click on the YT link and you’ll realize that he’s actually a genuine dude.

splish splash your opinion is trash

He’s taxing big boi companies like Amazon that pay $0 in taxes. It’s not *theft*, it’s *common sense*.

The statement “ugly commie politico” is wrong 3x.
1: *ugly*) Yang is a sexy beast. But anyway, if you’re running out of reasons to dislike a politician to the point that you just throw the word “ugly” in there, it really says a lot.
2: *commie*) He believes in capitalism that doesn’t start at 0. He’s not even socialist. Stop throwing around the word “commie” at everyone you don’t like.
3: *politico*) He’s not a politician, he’s a businessman, but an actually successful one. Unlike Trump, he didn’t start off with a “small loan of $1 million dollars.” He also didn’t drive anything he touched to bankruptcy.

Amazon’s doing what’s best for them, not the majority of the American people. However, what’s best for them is bound to harm the average Joe  while they increase automation and eliminate way too many jobs.

... if you want to live with 4 people good for you. But people want purpose in life, and I doubt barely anyone will do that. There will always be freeloaders but it’s a super rare scenario.

Read his policies page, which clearly explains how he’s gonna pay for it, then read the second link if you still have doubts. Don’t make claims before you research.

They have billions offshore that they don’t know what to do with. I think they should pay a little slice to the American people. Also, about your “people who don’t want to work” point: you can’t live off $1000/month. It’s a safety cushion not a livable income. It’s just so people struggling can get back on their feet. For other people it could mean buying the latest iPhone or saving up for a new car or something. All the new sales will create lots of jobs while Amazon is profiting by eliminating jobs with automation. Have you noticed stores closing around you? They can’t compete with Amazon. The retail workers then lose their jobs and end up in poverty. Same goes for manufacturing workers replaced by robots, or even truck drivers when Tesla refines their self driving trucks. These people will need a new place to work and the extra economic growth thanks to UBI will provide that. The reason trump got elected is because many people in swing states lost their manufacturing jobs to automation, and thought immigrants were the problem. This is why we need Andrew Yang to fix the root of the problem. You could just ban automation, but that’s not a great idea. That’s why he’s going with the approach of giving people who lost their job a safety cushion so they can find new work in the resulting growing economy.
Another thing to mention: Andrew Yang admits the government is bad at doing stuff. That’s why he says he’ll let the American people choose what to do with the money. One of his quotes is “the American government is bad at many things, but they’re pretty good at giving large numbers of checks to large numbers of people”
That’s why I support him. He’s a genuine dude.

You mean a 10% VAT that’ll get halfway passed through to consumers? So effectively a 5% VAT on the business which isn’t much when you’re talking Jeff Bezos. You’re acting like taking a couple billions from a trillion dollar company like Amazon is too much to ask. They’re sitting on piles of cash they don’t even know what to do with. It won’t slow them down one bit.

Good point, but Yang covers this. The average passthrough rate of VATs in Europe I believe becomes about 50%, and a 10% VAT with 50% passthrough is effectively 5% for the consumer. With that said, you would have to spend $20000 per month to lose your $1000 Freedom Dividend to VAT. On top of that, the majority of the gov revenue through VAT will come from business-business transactions. Check out  if you still have any doubts.

It’s not communism, not even socialism. It’s capitalism that doesn’t start at 0. Get out of your close minded bubble. I double dare you to read his policies page. Then compare it to the other candidates’ vague websites.
