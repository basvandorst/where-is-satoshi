Make copies of the file, first thing.
Next, secure the funds.
You can either leave them where they are or transfer via air-gapped machine. 
Don't forget to claim your BTG/BCH in the process! Free money on the table.

45 minutes into it. I recommend watching it!
Lots of information that I didn't know, in the aspect of events leading to where we are today, in detail.

The fact that it "allows" what I will for it, without the extra hoops is what is genuine about it. If I will for Bitcoin to buy me a coffee, place a bet, order a home, car or guns - it doesn't matter. It's 1 transaction away from a reality. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:25:48
They're like the unsung hero. Too many people are dealing with Coinbase's crap. 
Yeah, they take like a month to verify you, but hey, sacrifice the month NOW so that you can have convenience and ease of use LATER.
Highly recommend Gemini. 
The only caveat is, for fraud prevention, you can't withdraw money or bitcoin bought with said money until after the ACH transfer is fulfilled which takes 3-5 business days. However, if you always have an influx of cash going into Gemini, then this inconvenience is negligible.

Good question, but I don't necessarily think so and here's why: 
Yes, bitcoin can be used for things that fall south on the moral compass, such as something crazy, like funding terrorism, but a bet between two parties on a sporting event? It may be illegal in some areas, for whatever reason, but it's rather harmless and does constitute a genuine use of Bitcoin.

Their incentives will be tx fees at that point.

If you still need technical support, I'm willing to help and guide you. PM me if you need to.

If you had coins in a wallet you controlled at the time of their fork, then you have BTG. 
Coinomi is a wallet that you can import into and sweep your BTG.
Use changelley like Shapeshift.

Gemini.com is a platform that I use and I am a US resident. However, it takes a while to become a verified account. If you want a quick fix, try peer to peer alternatives like localbitcoins 
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:29:14
I cannot tell you whether or not blockchain.info has your private key or not. That's a point of failure, see? But I **do know** that you can move your coins off blockchain.info. 
And yes, there seems to be BTC-wary viruses out there. If you happen to get one, it could attempt to steal your funds. This is when a hardware wallet is recommended. 
Your level of security depends on your own paranoia. I just use a software wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:14:33
A) I use Electrum, it's UI is great and gives you full control. This sub will harp on you to get a hardware wallet. 
B) I use Gemini.com. Takes a while to get verified by them, but that's who I would recommend. It's better to buy in bulk to avoid trading fees, that's anywhere. 
C) Testing a transfer is as easy as knowing the other party's Public Address and then creating/signing/broadcasting the transaction to the blockchain. 
D) ACH Tranfers from your bank to an exchange shouldn't have fees. If your bank gives you a fee for that, get a new bank. The only fees you should ever encounter are exchange fees unless you're doing a wire transfer on a consumer-based level instead of a business level. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:26:47
Either make a backup of your wallet.dat file or backup your seed. 
Install the latest version of electrum from the verified webpage only. 
Honestly, you'll be fine. It'll be backwards compatible for obvious reasons.

No exchanges support the depositing / withdrawal of BTG currently.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:21:48
Best to send them an email *now* about the subject and hope for a reply beforehand or scour the Internet for your answer before the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:42:01
Capitalize as in, collect previously forked coins and sell them? 
If the wallet you currently have doesn’t already support BTG or BCH then you can use wallets that support those fork chains and capitalize on them by selling them off via peer to peer or through an exchange. 
As far as I know, no exchange service offers the deposit or withdrawal of BTG unless you had your coins on that exchange at the time of the fork. 
There are many exchanges that support BCH. You wont have trouble finding them. Bitfinex, for example. 
EDIT: I strayed off from your question. The answer you’re looking for is, for example, a bitcoin.com wallet or a Bread wallet. 
Yes, you can import you private keys and capitalize on forked coins from that point. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:21:27
Correct.  However, this sub will harp on you about having electrum on a Windows based operating system. 
Use MacOS or Linux if you want to use a software wallet (or just don't get a virus on the PC)
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:00:00
Nope, no replay attacks. Just move your BTC into a different wallet beforehand. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:13:08
If you can afford to lose it then go ahead, you’ll be fine in the long run.

I want this.
How can I get it?
@_date: 2017-10-10 04:19:20
Currently trying to liquidate my shares of BCC into BTC.
Will update soon.
But yeah, no time limit, but it's better to use it before it becomes worth even less.
*EDIT: ShapeShift was successful. Took me a minute to be able to get BTC.com to send my BCC over.*

Use **Gemini**.
 
Gemini.com does not get talked about enough on this subreddit.
They've done nothing but good to me because I've never had any technical issues with them. 
I'll admit though, they can be just as gay as Coinbase when there's a massive sell-off and they'll go into "maintenance"

You're not wrong except in the sense that - If I receive a stolen car from a dealership, who's going to go to jail?
Not me. I paid my dues, it's not my problem.

If you have an account number and routing number and the brokerage allows transfers then yes. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:32:18
The documentation is going to take like a month to approve, unfortunately.

To expand further: I'm interested in mining Bitcoin or ETH, but honestly, I'm confused about the whole ordeal. Not really educated fluently in the matter.
However, I got money, and I can buy a miner. However, would buying a Miner, specifically an AntMiner, go against the movement towards SegWit and whatnot? Rather, are the actions I'm going to take go against progress?
