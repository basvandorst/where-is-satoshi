A man is out to dinner with a hot date. He realizes he didnt bring any cash and when he attempts to use his card he is declined. Thankfully he is able to pay for the meal with bitcoin and also slay some mad pussy that night. Thanks Bitcoin!

Thats the thing we are the government, the voting system would be exactly like the blockchain, anyone can see who voted for who, i think if enough people demanded voting reform we could actaully create a more secure transparent government.

if you actaully read his post you know it can get simpler than that.

It doesnt matter what the fucking government thinks about it, we are the people and we can change things if we really want, i mean look at how far bitcoin has come. They were saying the same things about how no one woulde accept bitcoin and it was nerd internet money.

if you tell your employer your own political views that's your own risk, if anything it would make voting more anonymous seeing as how your vote came from and went to a random string of numbers. Even with the current system your employer doesnt have access to your political motives, unless of course you have balls of steel and really think he should hear your views

I kind of misworded that, anyone can see any address send votes just like bitcoin. You could just audit the blockchain to make sure verified addresses didnt vote twice, as far as extortion goes, it would be much harder to trace every address to every individual somehow know how they would vote in the first place and then inimidate them. Seems like it would hardly be possible to track and extort millions of people individually

My baby will eat tonight thanks to shapeshift.io Thanks for saying that after the fact to save face. Its very clear you give no fucks about people and there albeit shitty investemnts in GAW and the like. Its so very clear this is going to end up on Fox News: BITCOIN has been changed to the name of PayCoin. Following the change of Bitcoins name to PayCoin CEO shitbag Garza made to patranize the very people he fucked over with half assed "partners" and phone news outlets. Howd you make all your money? "Being a piece of shit and selling out our "customers" every fucking chance we get. We just throw shit together to get more money out of them. Sorry excuses for what a business should do and say.

Pathetic, watching this "industry" crumble is almost as entertaining as watching it "rise".
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:06:56
Well as you know the blockchain is a public ledger that anyone can see, any type of fraud would be found quickly, not to mention tallying the votes would be much easier just simply check the amount of coins or "votes" in said wallet.

Thats so much more conveniant that going to an atm, getting cash out instantly and buying drugs from a trusted dealer, not confusing at all for anyone who hasnt worked a tech job. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 21:29:08
What pros would that be? The fact that is hard to use or just that it is as vulnerable to attack as the traditional banking system.
