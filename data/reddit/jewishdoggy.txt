I was one of them at $19,000 :-)
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:56:03
I only paid $20. Was pretty nice.

Fully paid out. Made about 1k over the course of a month. Feels good

Of course! Waiting for 15k.

that’s not true at all. it’s really not hard to understand the concept of productivity and wages. let’s not act like we don’t understand why the baby boomers had life so easy...

well, to clarify, UBI makes sense because of the discrepancy between productivity and real wages. it’s not a “just print money” idea, it’s to give people money that was made by the productivity of automated robotics.
as far as economic theory goes, it makes sense.
