You are right, many people called 1k-1.5k as bottom and I used to keep on fighting with them saying that Bitcoin should not go this much low. If we see the price of Bitcoin after every bull market. It decreases anywhere between 70%-80%. Going to 1k means losing 95% in value that seems non- practical and most people sold their Bitcoins back then on [exchanges]( to buy back lower at 1k. I guess they will catch now. That is why I just hold my bitcoins and usually don't sell.

Yeah same here :)

Yeah after hitting 100k what I think is it will come down like 50% as we have seen this in the past.

Yeah you maybe right but according to history FOMO arrives in the market when Bitcoin breaks its ATH and now the ATH is 19k dollars so we need to break this number to start a parabolic bull market. But yeah thats true after 16k its not hard to reach 19k dollars for Bitcoin. Right now 10k is the new 6k I guess and its on a wonderful support and I am accumulating by [trading]( it as much as possible before it breaks 16k or 19k dollars.

Nailed it :D

Agree on that
@_date: 2019-08-28 09:20:07
Yes till now he is correct.

True, Bitcoin is still cheap due to its limited supply.

He hasn't said to sell now- He is suggesting to buy up to $100000 because he thinks up to that price its still cheap because its having limited supply. Everyone has their own opinion and by the way its better to sell your BTC on [exchanges]( rather than selling to unknown.

in Endgame hulk body and banner mind finally get merged but if compare that with this video, btc will be bullish and bearish at same time and its not possible practically.
