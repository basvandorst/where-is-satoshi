Yes IF you have the guts to do it or will you think it will keep going lower and never pull the trigger. No one knows what will happen tomorrow. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:22:38
This. Especially since you are located just off The Continent. There has to be plenty of options. Think globally not locally.

Not sure your point? The higher the number the better? 
My point was not an attack on the coins but the infra that is needed to support this coins. Exchanges, payment systems, etc. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:15:18
Really helpful for me (as an investor not a trader). In any kind of market is to make an investment schedule. Eg, I purchase $100 of ETH on every payday (fortnightly) without fail until I get to my total investment allotment. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:28:43
Easy to beat shorts. Just start buying. They work on margin as well and here’s the difference: longs losses are to 0 while there’s are infinite! 
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:50:37
Always a reason for market action. Futures, holidays, news. If market is going down there are more sellers than buyers. Personally I think we have built a nice base at 10k here. Climb to ATH will be slow but get there in 2018.

This. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:39:36
Can you walk down to the store and buy groceries with it? Pay a taxi fare? This may have been the peak but to say btc experienced mass adoption is just crazy. Hell half of the people reporting on it couldn’t even explain it properly. 
What you really had was a mania that is now in the process of correcting. That does not diminish the value or future of btc. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:31:56
There really are none that are perfect and this goes to the bigger point I’ve been making. The who infra system for crypto needs an upgrade. Fees are too high, transfers are too slow when the system is experiencing high volume. Crypto is here to stay but I’m afraid it’s not quite ready for prime time.

Not yet. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:56:20
It’s too volatile now. Won’t stay that way forever. That is why I said the mania needs to be flushed out of the system and it will. This is a 5 year old technology. As the volatility slows and the infra is built then it will become mainstream. Will btc be the winner? Who knows but crypto is here to stay. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:21:23
And you know that how? Do you think you can buy at he exact low?

Every situation is different. If you are having trouble sleeping over this cash some out and let the rest ride. This is not buying shares in Facebook on the first day of trading. 
This is “With financial support from Sanders and Hubbard, Bell hired Thomas Watson as his assistant,[N 15] and the two of them experimented with acoustic telegraphy. On June 2, 1875, Watson accidentally plucked one of the reeds and Bell, at the receiving end of the wire, heard the overtones of the reed; overtones that would be necessary for transmitting speech. That demonstrated to Bell that only one reed or armature was necessary, not multiple reeds. This led to the "gallows" sound-powered telephone, which could transmit indistinct, voice-like sounds, but not clear speech.”
Next level stuff that is, to use a baseball analogy, only in the 2nd inning. There will be winners and losers and plenty of chaos but there is no going back.

A few days. What’s the rush? Let it stabilise a bit. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 15:13:24
All of those exchanges get their order book from the top 3. That and wash trading is to make it look like they actually have volume which they don’t. It’s all an illusion and that is why price can get pushed around so easily. 
You admit it had some role causing a lack of liquidity so you are really arguing with me on the total effect it had. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 09:32:31
You will be. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 02:20:13
Yep as I thought. BitMEX controls this market
@_date: 2018-08-09 22:59:46

40% of total market volume is represented by 1 exchange. That is bad. Got it? 
@_date: 2018-08-29 11:20:16
Sue them. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 02:35:00
Great for traders but terrible for a crypto real world use case. And That’s coming from a 20 year trader. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 21:42:55
Correlation does not equal causation. The futures contracts on the CME are in the bottom percentile in volume. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:12:05
This s a good point and I suspect no one cares because 90% are in for the profit. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 22:02:09
Right at this specific time now he is. But look at the past, that trendline would’ve been different in 2012. Then again it would’ve moved at the next bottom. Just watch it for a few more months and it will move again. 
If price doesn’t do it then time makes trendlines move. I am a TA guy. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 04:47:53
If you didn’t get stopped out. Start posting your trades real time. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 23:06:10
Thanks for that lesson. All I will say is then you are missing the point from the bitcoin traditionalists. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 13:52:11
That’s not really the point. The pint is of a single market can move the price of btc, you aren’t getting approval anytime soon. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:14:35
Phone call? In crypto? Your story falls apart right there. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 03:04:52
Chicken and egg case really. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 15:30:26
Futures have zero effect. Look at the volume. It’s minuscule. Find another conspiracy, price is down because it was too high to begin with. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 05:41:48
Nice clear concise write up. 
I can’t warn people enough about 100 and 50x leverage. At these levels the liquidation price is very close to initial position. In crypto those types of moves happen in minutes. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 02:00:42
Not doubting you but anyone, even the exchange, that leaves 50x leverage position open is an idiot. Anyway will know more after the maintenance 
@_date: 2018-05-07 08:16:18
Upvoted. Important points and perhaps I’m missing something but I don’t understand how it works. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:59:01
Because it used to be a conference where things got done. Ie, groups would build a “consensus” on direction going forward. Now it’s just a big investor, marketing party.

Yes it’s nothing. Just 40% of total market volume is represented on 1 exchange! BTC is totally ready for an ETF. /r sarcasm 
@_date: 2018-08-22 02:26:28
Scandalous. Crypto will never be looked at as legit by regular Wall Street types if this continues. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 00:58:52
No way to do it on any exchanges I know. That is trading and it’s called slippage. 
However you could program a bot. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 14:22:08
Umm yes. Every major country has one and every multinational company is listed on most of them. Try again. NYSE, NASDAQ, Hang Seng, Shanghai, LSE, CAC, ASX, DAX
Even so it’s not the one exchange perse. It’s the obvious fact that between wash trading, bots and liquidity arrangements there is no REAL volume for crypto. It’s an illusion and it has become totally transparent with today’s events. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 15:21:07
BitMEX volume being absent moved the market. Semantics really. It still means crypto isn’t ready for an etf
@_date: 2018-08-22 14:13:49
Call it what you want but it’s true. You want to talk about etfs and mass adoption but one exchange can dictate prices. Good luck with that. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 12:06:51
Yes but with a different currency. They’ve actually changed it twice since then. 
The intrinsic value of all fiat eventually goes to zero. Without exception. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 08:24:31
It’s spoofing and they are most likely bots. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 02:47:07
And we need to stop being sheep and do our own research. There were a few clear heads sounding the alarm that this was overblown. However that doesn’t get the clicks. I’m onboard with your idea. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 12:24:30
You are correct. Thanks for reminding me. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 01:46:52
I think they closed positions. That’s what caused the spike to begin with. Let’s see what happens when they reopen 
@_date: 2018-05-31 14:18:10
All things considered, it could’ve been a lot worse. In the long run, $400 is probably worth the lesson.

I just hope a worse case scenario doesn’t drag the entire market down with it.

Pure speculation. Exchange volumes are down enormously. That is a fact. Whether it has to do with OTC is less certain.

OP is making a legitimate point. So instead of giving him/her other options or understanding his/her viewpoint, you attack because they dare question the status quo with a different point of view. And all of this is why the crash is needed if only to wipeout this tribalism that is so prevalent.

It’s been oversold several times since January. If you are trading a short term bounce then go for it but to go massively long due to oversold indicators alone is a good way to go broke. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:10:23
It’s a good setup. Buy here. Set stop loss 5% lower and see what happens. However, it breaks this triple bottom and we are in big trouble.

Maxim from the old stock days: The markets job is to frustrate the most amount of people in the shortest time.

You need an exchange that provides OTC (over the counter) trading. Many do. These trades will be off order book and decided between buyer and seller. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:56:44
Whatever helps you sleep at night. 
@_date: 2019-10-28 12:10:42
Depends on when you buy.
@_date: 2018-06-19 10:18:16
In the “old days” otc meant stocks that is not currently on an exchange. 
In the crypto era, it just means trades that are executed privately. In the current stock world it’s actually called dark pools. 
Anyway, you need to contact a large exchange. Most have an OTC desk. They will assist you in finding a buyer for your order for a small fee. All transactions are done “off exchange”.

True. 
As a trader All I look for is a good entry point that gives me 1. A clear point to know when I’m wrong and 2. A clear target for gains. This setup dies both. It’s worth a shot. Always use stops. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:17:12

Impossible not to unless your trade is strictly a day trade and you sit in front of it all day. Yes I know stops get run. Happens all the time. It’s part of the business but a mental stop is the worst. Especially for weak minded traders who really shouldn’t be trading in the first place

Edit to add: so you believe people buy btc to use and not speculation? If you are speculating and part of the Hodl crowd, you are making btc deflationary.
@_date: 2019-04-11 04:44:04
You don’t want hyper inflation as your money loses value faster than you can spend it. 
This will get downvoted to oblivion but what you want is low but steady inflation. If you have deflation which is what btc is, there is no reason for economic activity. Why spend my money today when I can buy more things with it tomorrow? Not good for the economy.

Even if it’s just a bluff, it’s working. Check the hash on btc. It’s barely running. Miners are sitting in hands.

So you thought Nvdia and other companies would try to manipulate crypto prices? These companies are listed entities. When you are on a regulated exchange such as the Nasdaq you have to divulge any investments interests news etc that could affect the share price of the company. It’s called fiduciary duty. 
Your mistake was confusing regulated markets with crypto markets.

A couple of points:
The problem is it’s not immediate. A few weeks lag time makes a big difference to small miners. You can have a 50% price drop in that span.
So what falling prices do is just make it easier for the big boys (with lots of capital) to enter the market so we become more decentralised at the end of the day.

2. Only risk max 3% of capital on each trade. See risk of ruin.

@_date: 2018-03-30 11:21:38
The thing about shorts is 90% are traded with leverage so that means if you get so many on the same side a small pop will lead to margin calls which mean they have to buy back higher. Long story short can get some strong rallies. So far we haven’t had many rallies which shows me there aren’t many buyers out there. You’ve got holders that are trapped and you’ve got short sellers. That’s it. 
Edit: spelling 
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:05:52
Never say never but we won’t go below 6k again. Look at the chart. We knew there is a lot resistance at 10-12k. We are working through that supply. The days of a straight up chart are over but I still see us testing ATH in the next 12 mos. FWIW
@_date: 2018-11-15 03:34:10

@_date: 2018-02-23 02:09:37
Look at the charts. Back in DEC we spent a few weeks at 12k, 11k and 10k. There is a lot of supply here we are working through. Everyone got spoiled with 50% moves in a week. This market is more mature with more players now. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:54:54

@_date: 2018-12-06 03:52:06
Yes but don’t forget with futures trading you have basically increased your supply of btc AND there’s no risk. Meaning I can go 100x short for $4,000 = $400000 worth of bitcoin and NEVER have to own 1 single btc.
Mark my word. Futures and ETFs will ensure you never see 20k again. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:11:15
I don’t see how you can say that when I can trade 100x the amount you own. You are trading 1x1. I am trading 100x1. If you can’t see that I can push you around with price then I can’t help you. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 04:16:10

Opinions are what make a market. We shall see. 
However there’s no denying the fact that btc main selling point was a finite supply but in the chase for profits that will be gone. It’s well known that futures and etfs have suppressed the price of gold for a decade. And those can even be settled in physical. Just imagine what paper btc will do when it floods the market.

Or at least take 20%, go to Bitmex, open short at 5x leverage. Once bottom is confirmed, close short and be happy.

@_date: 2018-12-07 10:04:07
Wow these comments show me that you “techs” really don’t understand how financial markets work. You are getting hung up on the word paper. 
The pint is if I can trade and move price with 100 btc that I do not own nor exist is it fair? Wouldn’t having to own that amount in order to trade it make sense? Also do you think my trading behaviour would be different if I had to own bitcoin in order to speculate? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:00:30
Again missing the point. This is about price discovery. If I can trade 100 btc but only need 1 btc for the privilege then you are at an extreme disadvantage on the spot market where you need 1 btc to trade 1 btc. 
In other words, you are giving power to people who don’t have skin in the game or very limited skin in the game. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 06:09:32

I’m glad you are “in it for the tech”. That way you won’t cry when it’s sub 1k.

@_date: 2018-12-06 03:54:12
That’s the difficulty. It raises plenty of questions but without any clarity it’s hard to panic at this stage.

Maybe but they do not have to take possession so the “limited supply” effect does not affect them. What it does is allow them more freedom to push price around. 
It’s well known that the price of gold has been suppressed by futures (and they even have the option of taking possession) and etfs. This is why we don’t need them for adoption. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 03:41:31
You need to know where they are going before you can make any assumptions. Are they going to exchange wallets?
