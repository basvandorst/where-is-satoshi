Your problem is not whether to invest in bitcoin or not, it is how to stop feeling guilty.
Your father is sick, so you feel guilty for enjoying things when he can't.
You feel that you made the money illegitimately, and that also makes you feel guilty.
Both of these are things you have written on here.
How to stop feeling guilty (will take time):
 * Realize that guilt does not actually help in either of the things you feel bad about. So it is literally useless. It has no function.
 * Realize your father probably doesn't want you to feel guilty.
 * Do things that make him feel good rather than thinking about things that make you feel bad.
 * Many many people on the planet have money they "don't deserve". Who gives a shit? That is just how reality is. Don't feel guilty, feel gratitude that the universe has rewarded you randomly. Enjoy it, please! Use it to do something good.
 * Find meaning and enjoyment. Probably the easiest way to do this is by helping other people. In doing this you may discover a problem that you want to solve and it may transpire that you can get paid to solve that problem. Maybein some self-employed capacity. The greatest gift that life can hand you is work that you are able to do, makes you money, and that helps others. That is where deep everyday contentment resides.
 * Money is power. Don't abuse your chunk of power or you will feel worse.
 * Don't compare yourself to richer friends. That leads to a bad place called America. Spend time with less fortunate people and compare yourself to them. You will feel better (but don't rub it in the faces of those people obviously).
 * The Christian is right that money won't make you happier, but it sure is useful. So you are smart to be careful and ask advice about investing.
So by all means, take a small punt on BTC, but consider the money lost the moment you invest it. It's a long term punt and it may fail. Do not let the loss of the money get to you now, or in the future. If you invest, let it go immediately so that it has now power over you.
After that use the rest of the money to fund living during self improvement of some kind (maybe finish degree if you can face it - probably smart move). The best and most ethical way to make money is by having a useful skill and doing good work.
