Ah ok I see what you're saying. So it's more of a long term trading strategy for people that have bought and are still holding.

From USA, but I live in England and Zurich. I think any bitcoin exchange in Europe should work though right? To be honest, some recommendations here hint that sites to buy instantly are more convenient than escrow systems.

Ok thanks for the advice. I'm sure that I will be using at some point. I did some research on Localbitcoins and their volume charts show so many countries (Russia, Argentina, most of Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, Australia) have exponentially growing trading volumes.
I think many of the tutorials from before did not include the heads up on excessive ID verification for places to buy. But now it's more obvious to me that this is the norm everywhere and only one or two sites allow people to buy without ID verification.

That makes sense yes. I saw that Gemini is based in the US. I'm American but currently living between the UK and Switzerland. Perhaps a European site for bitcoin purchase will simplify the verification of my identity and documents?

thanks for the recommendation. I actually saw Localbitcoins website recommended across many forum posts. I did notice that when buying btc on this site the price is higher than the average market rate. Would this be the best option for a large (high volume) purchase?

Some people were saying that this is the best site to buy bitcoin. Though I'm curious to know what makes it better than the other proposed here in your opinion?

yes good point. As another redditor stated above, it looks like a better strategy to simple buy, hold, and further expand my position when the price dipping opportunity arises.

Great - thanks that list is really useful. It actually includes a bitcoin ATM map and I found one near enough to me. Though I'll probably buy online as this simplifies things enormously. It seems there's are many places to get bitcoin for beginners also. Kraken looks pretty advanced and has some solid reviews. I've read mixed reviews of Coinbase but I might give it a go to see how easy purchasing is. Cool tip concerning bitsquare. Let's see..
