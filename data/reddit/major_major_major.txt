I don't get it.  Selling your house for BTC would be like selling your house for USD. Unless you are purposely selling your house at a loss, you wouldn't be losing any wealth.

You need pretty sophisticated software plus employees to deal with player collusion. I'ts not impossible, but it seems out of reach if you need to keep operational costs down to allow for a 0% edge.

What if you kept a separate wallet, with the bulk of your bitcoins, on a flash-drive in a safety deposit box, and your "spending money" bitcoins, analogous to the cash in your pocket, on your home computer, encrypted of course.  I think that would be a reasonable defense against theft, one which is at least as good as that which protects anything in a safety deposit box.

Mt. Gox must have taken care of it while I was sleeping.  I am back to my $8.  As a poor college student, it was nice having double my net worth for a night.  But at least bitcoins are back up to $20.

No, I need him to stare at it for a while, bring prices down so I can buy in tomorrow.

In my deposit history, it gave a bank account number.  Do you think the best way to get the money back would be to put the money into my own bank account and then wire it to that number?

The writer put all his money into bitcoin last year.  He is looking at some very good profits right now, if the takes them.  He should think about selling a break-even position soon, just to be safe.

If you had mined millions of coins, the Bitcoin economic system would not have been diverse enough to succeed, your coins would be worth roughly zero cents each, and none of us would be here talking about it.

So how future-proof is Bitcoin?  Can its encryption survive if, for instance, quantum computers become household items, or when personal computers are a billion of times faster than all human brains combined (Ray Kurzweil once predicted this occurring before the year 2050)?  Can the encryption techniques behind Bitcoin be upgraded in the future?  I do not know much about the technology, nor the cryptography, behind Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-25 22:48:31
That's a good idea.

Remittance is interesting.  I think two things need to happen to get a hold in this market.  First, it needs to be easier to convert Bitcoin to a numerous number of foreign currencies.  Second, knowledge of Bitcoin and it's advantages needs to spread even more, which will naturally happen.
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:14:52
I like the sound of bitcent (and a bitcent is already worth over $2).  When you hear bitcent, you already know it is a hundredth of a bitcoin (not so with cBit).  But, I'm sure this debate will rage on until one name or another eventually seeps its way into the mainstream.

Yes, but you can't pay your rent with bitcoin right now, in most places.  Expectations are just expectations.  Risk management is more important than just the possibility of greater return.

Open an online wallet with blockchain.info.  It's pretty secure, if you use double encyption and the think where they send a key to your cellphone to log in.  It's good for beginners because it is like using paypal.

There will eventually be banks where you can store your bitcoin, and this will make it easier for non-technical people to handle their money.  I know, you might say that one upside of bitcoin is that banks don't control your money.  But banks are useful and therefore will always crop up organically.  Banks loan out your money and give you some of the interest, so it is usually a better idea to keep your money in a bank than, say, under your mattress, or in a wallet on your computer.  
The problem with bitcoin banks is that they will be unregulated.  Perhaps, they will end up being a cross between a bank and a lending-tree type small-loan internet model.  It will be interesting to see.

We might start by getting Mt. Gox, Blockchain, and Bitcoinity to display the current price of both 1 bitcoin and 1 bitcent, and later 1 milibitcoin.

Twitter is definitely a competitor to Facebook.  If you are spending time on Twitter, you are not spending time on Facebook. Both are social network sites which compete for the time you spend interacting with others online.
Facebook has for the last two years been trying to emulate Twitter functionality with status updates, hence [this]( new development.

Terribly paraphrasing some article I read somewhere, if you put a bunch of people together who are all like-minded on a certain subject, they will, due to group-reinforcement and the lack of contrary view-points, eventually become fanatical.
