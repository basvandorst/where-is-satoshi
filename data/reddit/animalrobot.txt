Good point, I'm not sure...just added a random item to my cart to test if the option was available.  Will double check and report back.

It could be your lucky day.  My wife said she wanted to knit another one anyway and will do it for 20mBTC for the supplies + 30mBTC for the labor and you pay the shipping.  PM me if you want to make this happen!

Not currently, though I have been aggregating the data for 5+ months.  Next priority is to tame the front-end a bit and add the ability to view different period resolutions.  Will definitely consider adding historic data to the mix.

Tweet at B&amp;H and ask them if they'll accept BTC.  I did this a while ago and they weren't totally against it.  I think there is a lot of overlap between btc early adopters and photo geeks.

Done!  Thanks for the suggestion.  I put it in too...hope that's not too spammy :P

It's interesting that everyone is jumping to the conclusion that this is a bot gone haywire.  Not saying that it isn't, but there could be more than meets the eye going on here.  Some kind of strange arbitrage, laundering, or other form of market manipulation or exploitation.
Suppose this person decided that all the uncertainty created by this kind of behaviour would drive the price down significantly, made a large directional bet and counted on recovering more than the cost of transaction fees for generating all that volume.
Maybe this person has found an exploit in btce that nets them more than the cost of the transaction fees and the large volume is just a side-effect.
Maybe it's just a bot gone haywire, but I don't think this is a foregone conclusion.

Color represents amount of positive or negative volume for a specific period.


That's basically the point of this representation of the data.  A high volume period would be unlikely to have a "0" because most events that produce large volume, produce one sided volume - either buying or selling (Wink ETF, Mt. Gox etc.)


Agreed.  It took a lot of infrastructure to just get it to this point.  Once I refactor and refine some things I plan to add such features.


Should be your local time, but it could be a bug.  Is it displaying in your local time?
Thanks for your input.

I think there is close to 30 mBTC of yarn in that thing ;)  My guess is that it was about 15 hours of knitting.

Wow, that's a cool site!  Tradingview's Volume Profile indicator seems to  tally the buy / sell volume per price level.  This chart views the same data at the intersection of time and price.

Thanks for the kind words all :)  Looks like a reddit death hug is breaking things right now.  I'm currently working on another version that should be a little more robust and reduce some of the bandwidth issues.  Appreciate the tips and feedback!

Hey Fraenk, Thanks for the kind words.  I'm working on another iteration that will include different timeframes (and hopefully some different instruments).  No plans to open-source ATM, but I'm always open to collaboration.  PM me if you'd like.
@_date: 2015-01-04 19:56:14
Thanks for the kind words and the TLDR.  It's a little challenging to wrap your head around at first, but I think it's a much more in-depth way to view the market than traditional candlestick charts.

Thank you.  It can't handle many simultaneous connections right now - working on another version that should be a little more robust.

Look at how many people are on the Slock.it DAO slack - the experiment is already happening.

IMO there are very few non 'digital natives' that understand how fundamentally transformative software is, which is the required foundation for understanding Bitcoin.  That's why you don't see Buffet, Soros, or any other investing legends talking about Bitcoin and other cryptos.   It's just outside of their scope of expertise.

If you mine a GPU mineable coin, you can have your cake and eat it too.  Buy the gaming rig, mine Ether or X11 and then exchange for BTC!

Oh, and a bit of context, since I know people have had trouble understanding wtf is happening on the site...Coinsight tracks whether transactions are happening at the ask price (buys) or the bid price (sells) across the big exchanges.  It aggregates the data by period and price, and paints a real-time picture of bitcoin market sentiment across all the exchanges.  The sentiment data mapped on top of the price data can help traders and other participants understand if the momentum of a move is increasing or decreasing (momentum decreasing often precedes a reversal in price).
Happy to answer any other questions about how it all works!

Let me just add that the content should be fair game for monetization due to the fair use doctrine, but it's currently up to YouTube and the owners of the IP that I remixed to decide.

Pale horse, thanks for the note.  Now that this is live, some video tutorials are the next step :).  See my conversation with John for a brief answer to your question.  I can message you the url for the video tutorial when it's live.
@_date: 2015-03-03 02:27:26
Hey John! Yes, that's a great TLDR. Maybe I'll borrow it ;) And motivation in this case is the buyer or sellers willingness to cross the bid/ask spread to transact at a less favourable price in exchange for the privilege of transacting immediately. That's why when the price is 'rallying' or 'tanking' you see the big red and green blocks - traders are saying "let me in", or "get me out" immediately. They are acting emotionally and don't want to wait to transact at a better price.

Bid delta 'divergences' are a somewhat predictable pattern that you can trade.  For example, price is heading lower, and there is lots of volume transacting at the bid.  Price makes a new low, but bid volume does not.  Momentum usually peaks ahead of price.  When the momentum runs out in one direction, it's an opportunity to get in before the price reverts.  Small example attached.

The Diamond Age, by Neil Stephenson, has a secondary title: ' A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer'.  It's a really interesting book, and I highly recommend it (though it has nothing to do with cryptocurrency).  Better to read the book before exploring the meaning of the title!

As I mentioned in the article, the people at the top of the order book always get to transact first.  On any legitimate exchange, a bid that is higher than the lowest ask will be filled immediately at the lowest ask price.
For example, if the current lowest ask is $299 and I submit a bid for $399, I will get filled immediately at $299.  It's because the person with the best ask gets to transact ahead of all the other asks - this is the most fair system for both the buyer and the seller.
The bid/ask "spread" is the difference between the highest bid and the lowest ask.  In another example, if the bid is $300 and the ask is $305, then the bid ask spread is $5.
Hope this helps!
