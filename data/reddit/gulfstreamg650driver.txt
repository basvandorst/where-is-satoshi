He picked the wrong side of the argument and is now too stubborn and arrogant to admit it.

He is certainly a braver and more patient man than I.
@_date: 2016-08-29 21:18:24
The side that makes sense. He just mentioned the flaws with block size increase and your response is well that's just the other side? That's not how technical consensus works - there are good ideas and bad ideas. Clearly XT and Classic were bad ideas and those forks are dead. You are just trying to muddy the discussion which is a classic shill tactic.

I dont think msm exists for profit. Msm brings something way more important than profit for its owners. It bring political and cultural influence.
We need to start looking at the owners of the msm (specifically who controls the board) and consider their intentions.
If a msm entity runs on a loss, they will simply sell to another oligarch (or oligarch controlled entity) and continue the charade for a few more years.

Paying it back with fed fiat that was issued at interest to someone else. 
You can dance around the point all you want, but you are never getting away from the fact that all money from the fed is issued at interest and needs to be paid back - except of course to pay it back you (or whoever is holding the bag)  have to borrow more fiat from the fed and thus the cycle never ends - and ultimately collapses.

@_date: 2016-07-04 14:08:00
These have clearly been attacks - not difference of opinion. When you can prove that block size increase introduces risks - then it no longer a valid opinion - and yet if you are still shoving down people's throats, then it is an attack and an obvious one at that.
You won't win - screaming can't trump technical consensus.

Why we be happy with an increase when we know it is a temporary yet shitty solution? 
@_date: 2016-07-29 10:11:00
Yes let's just increase the block size because there is not a lot of code to add and it is a an elegant long term scaling solution. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:31:22
Increased blocksize is a major factor in driving centralization, so I'm happy that they are very cautious when increasing blocksize. Increasing blocksize by an MB or two doesn't solve anything either.
