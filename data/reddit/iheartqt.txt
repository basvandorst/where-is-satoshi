Not true with a hardware wallet. With my private key I can still recover my funds.

How many coinbase accounts though? Most noobs never create a wallet and keep their holdings on there. I would be willing to bet that more than half of coinbase users do not have a wallet.

I have mine stored securely but I also spent a lot of time memorizing my words. I made a song in my head and I can confidently recite all 24 words now. Not the best option, but in the case that my house burns down, I can at least fall back on my song.

Awesome. I just submitted but this makes me feel much better that it will get through before August 1st.

Check out this thread: 
Looks like it took people about 6 hours for their transactions to go through, and this was today. I just submitted my withdrawal, I'm not worried about missing the August 1st date at this point.

I'm using breadwallet as well. Is that considered the best wallet? Are there obvious pros/cons of different wallets? I've had bitcoin in coinbase for a few months but I am happy to get out of it. What would potentially happen if breadwallet "went under"?
