Bit of a chicken-egg situation don't you think?

Bitcoin is totally schizo. It's a currency! It's a long term investment! It's gambling!

"You put money into Bitcoin that you can afford to lose and you HOLD it."
Ah yes, Bitcoin, the currency of the future that you are not allowed to spend.

You're getting pretty good at convincing yourself that you can look into future. You're like a child in the backseat of the car looking out the rear window guessing when the next turn will come.

Yup, and their panties are in a bunch because they believed (and still do believe) that they can outsmart the crowd and call the "real" tops and bottoms. They should have called it Bitoption.

Nice to see some sort of sense in here. Where was OP two months ago? Screaming at the noobs to stay away from bitcoin? I think not.

Hey this guy called the last 6 coin flips. Clearly he knows more about coin flipping than you.

It's just so funny to me. So many people screaming HODL! and BUY! when almost everyone who owns bitcoin is just hoping to sell at the perfect moment. There's this group delusion that bitcoin is both a currency and an investment. Every day you see crazy claims about how bitcoin [will replace the old currencies]( but then people like OP will tell you to only put money into bitcoin that you can afford to lose! Imagine if people said the same thing about dollars. Only buy as many dollars as you can afford to lose!

LOL. Look at your post history. You're the shitposter and probably a compulsive gambler. This was a good article, honestly looking at the risks.

Looked back on your post history. Nice to see I'm not the only one who thinks this is nuts. It's a giant game of musical chairs.

Nailed it. Been watching this sub turn into something of a financial death cult for the last few days. I've seen at least a dozen comments/posts claiming that it was going to crash but to hold and even buy. Yeah, people who think they can call a peak may be idiotic, but people who believe the crash isn't over and don't sell? That's just crazy. But they all clearly get a sort of sick pleasure out of passing the hodl purity test.
