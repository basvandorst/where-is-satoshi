Plus they intend to tax 20% of merged mining. Plus it's getting into the vaporware side. It's just another scam. You want solidity contracts ? There is ETH. You want instant low fee payments ? Go for LN.

Also, the current situation is not 19% flat tax. It's 19% plus the social (health / retirement) contributions: between an additional 25 or 45% depending on which category the tax autorities decide your investment belongs compared to your other sources of income. So it's a total between 45 and 65% of benefits. Hodl !

This address is invalid, so your coins didn't go nowhere and you should be able to get it back. That's strange because I suppose Coinbase would not have let you send bitcoins to an invalid address. Contact Coinbase support instead of Binance because they have your transaction's details.

My concern is centralization. If bitcoin price drops below 3000, all the small miners will stop their operations. Only the most profitable ones (aka Bitmain and subsidiaries) will stay.
@_date: 2018-06-14 10:36:28

1°) CT transactions will be optional (and more expensive), it's mandatory in monero.
2°) CT only obfuscates the amount afaik. Monero obfuscates also the sender and the receiver adresses, plus soon their IP adress.
So monero stays monero, the only truly fungible cryptocurrency. But CT would be a great improvementfor LTC / BTC.
@_date: 2019-02-02 12:28:08
This is mostly bullish for ICOs, not for adoption of bitcoin as a mean for payments or store of value.

Duckduckgo.com has a QR code generator embedded. Just key in "QR" + your address in the search box and voila.
Of course I  use it only for public addresses.

Thanks for the answer. But with the worst ennemy of bitcoin having 40% of hashrate I really don't understand why the last core update didn't have that protection. What a lame mistake.
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:18:54
I agree. When I speak about bitcoin around, people often say that one bitcoin is too expensive to buy for them. And if I explain it is possible to buy a fraction, they feel frustrated to have only a fraction and would never buy. There is a "it's too late" feeling that is a barrier to adoption.

Your trade is not confidential because Poloniex monitors and logs what you are doing. But if you withdraw to your own monero wallet nobody knows where it goes. Check the newcomers' sticky post on monero subbreddit.

This is basically a commercial for Coinbase. Noobs should now that they are full of flaws and there are much better,.reliable and cheaper exchanges (e.g. bitstamp).

That is neither a bug or a feature. That is a weakness. I didn't know you had to HF to modify it though.

I already red this is a possible miner strategy. Or that they will dump all their btc to bch they are currently accumulating and kill both 1x and 2x.
If they do something like that and bankrupt hundreds of thousands of people they will be accountable. And honestly, who in the world would ever follow their chain in the future, whatever it is.

You can try monerujo on the google beta playstore. Not official but open source and assessed as legit by the community. Don't use freewallet though, it's a scam. Official mobile wallets coming this winter.

They also mispelled moreno.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:06:42
He is just dumping a huge stack of btc to pump bch right now, trying to hype their coin and move hashrate. This is going to be very expensive for him and Roger. Less expensive if they are playing with central bank of China's money though. Also, as the majority of the pump trades are done in Korea I don't understand how he could move his money out of China with the harsh capital transfer laws there.

Well, segwit activation will make possible LN, mimblewimble, smart contracts layers,....

Satoshi didn't foresee asics and mining centralisation. Asics resistant pow algorithms à la monero are much better but I think it's too late for btc. What about miners who invested millions in asics and are signaling segwit ? We would have 90% of hashrate against a pow change bip.

It depends of the apps, I realized some are bigger than others. For example the DCR app is huge and won't fit along with the BTC one. I could install BTC + ETH + LTC + VIA + VTC. That is five, not so bad. It's fine for me as I use my Ledger for long term cold storage and I can uninstall / install apps when needed. That must be a big pain in the ass for the traders or merchants though. The small memory can also be seen as a security feature as there is not enough space remaining available for a malware. I won't buy a Ledger X just for the convenience of more apps as I don't really need it + bluetooth really ?
@_date: 2019-01-29 03:20:21
Follow the guide I mentioned above. Use raspbian lite btw.

I agree. Buying bitcoins with debts is idiotic and bad for the ecosystem. People who do that have probably bought late 2017 and are selling right now.
@_date: 2017-09-20 11:39:30
If what those guys really want is big blocks + segwit why don't they fork from BCH and add segwit to it instead of ruining BTC ecosystem ? I mean, seriously.

That's really a pity for the fair asic resistant coins who are researching in order to have full mobile nodes (e.g aeon, wownero). Portable miners can be very good for decentralization for these kinds of little projects. Google should just ban mining apps with no explicit consent from the user at each launch, not every mining algorithm.
Anyway, people using these coins are usually geeks compiling the source code or downloading on F-droid, they won't give a sh**.

The very next test for bitcoin value and adoption will be the global crash of other assets. Will it crash also because of a huge need for fiat and a general sentiment of fear ? Will it moon as the last anti-inflationary shelter ?

It can be also a seller. He buys a bull wall in order to move the price up and trigger sell orders. You can detect that if he cancels or lower the wall if price goes down.

Nonsense. There is nothing related to the "volume": sender, recipient and amounts are not visible in the blockchain.
Plus conversion places are everywhere (exchanges, shapeshift, xmr.to,...). You still have to be on tor for full opsec but the i2p protocol will be embedded soon. This is actually the only existing coin almost perfect for this use case (privacy &amp; fungibility).

Nice analysis. 2 points though:
- Just focusing on the price, I am not sure there is any correlation with the square of "users" (nodes ? wallets ? transactions ? transactions per wallet ?)
- If BCC survives, I am confident that some pledged / atomic swap technologies between the two chains will be developed, re-creating the conditions for a 100% network effect.

I really wonder how BCC could survive with the current btc difficulty and super low hashrate. Perhaps Viabtc and other miners will give a portion of their hashrate to bcc for at least a few weeks ? That would be good for them if this coin survive I suppose.

Basically they need expensive RAM and Cache memory.
See here for Monero: 
I think Monero devs said that they would change the algorithm to make it even more expensive in case the price skyrockets.

Some miners signaliing UASF amongst those already signaling SW would be even better.
@_date: 2017-06-03 12:11:25
A bank would not even do that. They are worse.
Mixers are a bad idea as you get only super tainted coins plus you have to trust them. Monero has a bright future...
