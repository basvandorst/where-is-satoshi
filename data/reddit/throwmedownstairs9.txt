It’s hard for me at least to argue its strengths with people that are knowledgeable and experienced with traditional market trading. Especially ones that do it successfully.

Yea it’s not generating new bitcoin. What it’s doing is creating panic and then they can squeeze just a bit more from the people that will panic sell if they see a quick 10% drop or whatever. Then they have some at an even better position for the next time it pumps.

FBs shitcoin will definitely help the masses embrace crypto. But not because they can use crypto and the FB coins together. Because it will show people why bitcoin is so much better. The fb coins will make people realize they are just giving their money to fb for more fb features and worthless crap. then they will notice BTC holders still getting richer.

I mean nations tend to cooperate when they both have mutually beneficial positions on something. If bitcoin really threatens all of their power and control enough they will make friends real quick, take back their power, then go right back to backstabbing and trying to take advantage of each other again.

No I’m saying as soon as we hit 8k there was a large number of sells that brought it back under 8k and it stayed there for a few days before going back over. Lots of people use alerts and then go on after to make the trades themself. Maybe there were a lot of people that did that.

That wasn’t a pump. It was just a large sell off from hitting a significant resistance point. a lot of holdr’s that had been waiting a while now to withdraw some earnings and see what they want to maybe buy back in with. This happened the day it hit 8k not even a few weeks ago. Relax people.

This happened when we first pushed over 8k a week or two ago. It’ll be fine It’ll be staying above9k I bet by the time the weekend is over.

I enjoyed it on Spotify. Very cool dude well done.

Yea this is what I think. We saw a similar response when it hit 8k just a bit less volume I think because it wasn’t as significant in value as this high.

Lmao what an analogy. But true that.

So what did bitcoin running up to 20k mean? It wasn’t because of decreasing usd value.

Lol what a jackass. That made me laugh, and he’s the billionaire investor... okay lol. And yea it’s obvious someone with a cash position such as his right now might not care. im surprised the guy didn’t say anything like well if you took a position within the last 6 months you’d be like 30-40% up.
