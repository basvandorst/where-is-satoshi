It amazes me that people who argue that bitcoin has no "backing" turn around and then argue that "real dollars" do. They did, once upon a time. Those days are gone. The faith is still there though but it took awhile to build that faith.

[:/]( My dad just rubbed it in... :/
I mean bitcoin helped me have enough money for a down payment on a house... But had I held on to it all the way to closing I'd still have more.

I don't think you understand... He's saying that in the context of SEC post this guy comes off as an idiot. These ICOs prey on people and the advise is good. Comparing a day/week/month old currencies that are literally Pyramid schemes to a currency that's been around for longer than 2 centuries and isn't going anywhere in the foreseeable future is rediculous.
Despite all of the above, you are correct... We should always question "long held or dogmatic presuppositions when it comes to what money is". We should always look to protect ourselves in the worst of situations. We should always question authority.

That would allow me to put a down payment on a house, when paired with the other money that I have saved up, which sounds good to me.

Lol I sold half of my 1 coin to do that last week. Not regretting it, but I should have waited heh.

I missed the train haha but I'm ok with that. I found bitcoins when they were 2$, thinking they would not catch on or not knowing what to use them for I never bought into them. I looked at buying them when they were 20 only a couple of months ago, figuring they might dip to 15 again. And then again when they dipped to 63 after being 70+ for a bit.
I didn't lose anything so there is no reason to be sad and if I all I did was dwell on regrets then my life would be shit. Wouldn't it? It's all gambling, and you broke even.
With that being said, I totally mined .05btc and now it's worth 5$... O.O That's crazy.

I'm going to be "that" guy because it's a personal pet peeve, but it's 'ad' not 'add'. Advert, advertisement not addvert or addvertisment.

Probably... But I'm talking from an investment standpoint. If there are things I wish to buy or contribute to, they will be bought.

I'm waiting for it to come down to 15$/BTC after fees. But like above poster... If it hit 5$ again... So many would be bought by myself.
