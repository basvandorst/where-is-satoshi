I remember when it was ~$1500 earlier this year and thought: if there are trillions of dollars in USD, how can one expect there to only be ~$30 billion worth of bitcoin in the long run? Not possible. I think $150,000 each isn't so unbelievable.

great name for a currency. but yeah it would be a pump and dump scam
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:47:25
bring it on bad times.
seriously though, here are some factors that make me think it will go up forever just as I think the population and the economy will go up forever:
1. As I said, the population growth isn't stopping for anyone. More demand.
2. People are constantly adopting technology at a younger age. Also more demand.
3. Fixed maximum supply. When demand increases, since supply can't change, price increases.
4. People aren't just adopting technology at an increasingly younger age, they're also adopting it around the world more.
5. Information technology progresses exponentially. Anyone who frequents a future-related subreddit (like has known this for a while. I see the Internet of Things bringing even more demand to the table.
Basically the only thing that can affect the price once there are 21 million is demand, and I think that will only go up.

Yeah I did leave most of my money in bitcoin, but I lost some money on quantum resistant ledger. Didn't think that would be a pump and dump but tbh I should have expected it.

Apparently a masternode (I think that's what you're referring to) isn't considered proof of stake, more like a proof of commitment. I don't think, other than that, it's subject to much different market forces than any other mineable currency. I wonder if I should buy Dash :S

Well, my mom saved my dad from losing a shitload of money in the stock market by telling him to stop after losing $200k during the financial crisis. She never let him trade and as soon as he started -- financial crisis. Sucks. I guess it's not the best argument since the stock market is a lot of luck, but so is bitcoin. We think we *know* it's going to go up, but we just, well, *think* it will. Of course, you can only lose what you put in, but can make vastly more, so you can (and should) decide to risk what you can afford to lose.

It said 3 before I panicked and converted them to litecoin and withdrew lol... I thought it might immediately send them back out to some hacker's address since those transactions were just sent and I figured those would go stale/get thrown out if there was no balance. For some reason I thought my account was compromised since I don't remember seeing any other transactions on the block explorer which had the coins sent out immediately after they were sent to the specified address. I knew it was either something the exchange just does or a hacker and I figured it wasn't worth the risk of finding out, so I'd ask reddit and discord and stuff for now. For the amount of knowledge I had I didn't make a bad decision imo but it seems I was wrong lol

@_date: 2017-08-14 20:18:55
You don't hear them complaining about men divorcing them and taking half their money, do you? No because that almost never happens. Marriage is fucking stupid. The second your mind ventures to what it would be like to not have the "have to get married" cloud hanging over your head, you'll realize how truly free you can be. Your sex life won't suck, your financial life won't suck (without kids you could even travel anywhere for however long you want), your health won't suck, and you'll be able to completely uproot your entire life at the drop of a hat if you change as a person. People shouldn't *plan* to get married; if you really want to get married then wait until you can't imagine not being married to the person you're with. Although imo that's a horseshit delusion. I think guys only want that because they're taught to want that and they're afraid of what their family, who has always referred to their future with the premise of having a wife (for guys) and kids, would think of them. By the way, I say wife for guys because until you come out, you are assumed to have a wife and kids in your future. As someone who's bi, the moment I realized I could marry a guy instead of a girl made me think: why the fuck would I ever get married to a guy? If I'm with a guy, then he'll probably also not want to get married. What guy would give a shit if we don't? And why would either of us want to be monogamous *ever*?? Boyfriend, maybe. But married, why the fuck. It just shows that people (even I) have a hard time thinking outside social norms. So moral of the story: fuck bitches get bitcoin.
Edit: HAH I got gilded bitches! (don't divorce me and take half plz)

@_date: 2017-05-20 22:33:36
No it starts there because otherwise the equation wouldn't make any sense. If I started at the peak of the bubble, it would retroactively predict that it was like millions of dollars when it was created. If I include all the data, it takes into account the bubble of hype and stupidity and the mt. gox hack and subsequent crash and global distrust in bitcoin. My method is the best one, because this time the data is normal, reasonable, and makes sense.

your brain is different atoms than it was 3 months ago. You can sever the corpus callosum and have two halves that learn to operate independently as two separate people. You can merge consciousnesses with another in the future. Consider this: what if you froze your brain, made a clone, switched one of the halves with the same half of the other brain, and then your mother had to decide which one to take home to put in your old body and the other one would be incinerated. Like... wat. Yeah it's not as simple as everyone thinks. Consciousness may be nonlocal and substrate-independent.

@_date: 2017-05-20 21:26:39
so we're doing better. That's great; based on the trend this is an anomaly, meaning either something unexpected happened or it's a bubble. I'll update the graph when I get more data. No I don't realize that this is just stupid, because the point I'm trying to make was that bitcoin is growing exponentially. All you pointed out is 1: that it's growing even faster than the equation says, but 2: that you think the idea of it growing $1 million per year in 9 and a half years is stupid. The only basis you have for that belief is the natural pessimism in your oversized amygdala.

DON'T buy an audi. I bought one used for ~23k and I only put 20k miles (it had like 25k) on it before the top broke and the stealership said it needed a replaced convertible top motor and pump and wires connecting to the control module because of a leak (of which there were 2, but one wasn't important). Also the starter broke once and I had to drive around with a battery pack to use every time I started my car. We've probably spent $6k on the car fixing it and now it's only worth like 14. Fuck Audi. And Fuck Audi some more.

oh yeah lol.... it's actually every other month but ik. it doesn't matter though, technology is increasingly working in exponentials these days. Many many tech statistics grow exponentially (bandwidth, transistors on a chip, size of computers, price of computers, even the medical industry is inheriting this phenomenon because our total medical knowledge is doubling every 3 years). I see cryptocurrency growing exponentially. It starts shallow and boring, then all of a sudden it goes crazy.

Out of curiosity, since 90% of the world's money is electronic, does that mean the banks can just *say*/type in that they have a ton of money and then they actually have it?

Compare a $100/day wage vs a $2/day wage. 10 days to make $1k vs 500 days. Don't go around thinking you know *anyone* who values $1k as much as this guy values $200k, unless you live in poverty by a global standard.

If she dates a guy *because* he's black, she's racist and will think less of you for being white if you date her. Dating someone that *just so happens* to be black or white or whatever is fine. What he's saying is that if a woman chases black guys for their blackness, *she* has a complex and is toxic. The whole term BBC is fucking twisted and racist; every race has the same dick size according to wikipedia.

I answered your first question already when I said "If I include all the data, it includes the bubble of hype and stupidity and the mt. gox hack and subsequent crash and global distrust in bitcoin." I didn't want that because I think that had nothing to do with bitcoin's real value. Nothing can predict bubbles and if an equation includes the bubbles in its data set then it's a retarded equation. Those are completely different phenomena than the one I'm measuring. Notice how I never said "my equation doesn't predict any bubbles therefore none will happen"? What could the function possibly look like that does predict them?... The point is that bubbles are created out of ignorance, and if you trace my equation back to the time when it was $1000 at the peak of it, my equation would show you its "intrinsic value" (financial term).
I don't think you understand why it makes sense not to include the early days, either. No one knew about bitcoin until right before the bubble when it started getting mass media coverage, and from then on the entire world knew. Now that everyone knows, it's on a completely different growth pattern and won't go back to one that depends on no one knowing about it. Even if I trace the equation back to 2010, it says it was intrinsically worth $2/ea. They were cents then, but the world didn't know about them, which is what my equation assumes. It isn't correct because a bunch of techno-geeks couldn't make the price of bitcoin go up that fast -- only mass adoption could. Had the world seen bitcoin coming, there would have been no bubble and the retroactive predictions would be more accurate.
