Yes that is my only real objection. 
For stocks, market cap absolutely always refers to total shares outstanding. Bezos owns 16.63% of Amazon, but that share is included in the market cap of Amazon. And for any fundamental valuation framework, market cap is probably the single most important thing. 
You can argue market cap is irrelevant for crypto, and that people who use it erroneously deserve whatever happens, but I think the community should strive to provide useful, understandable tools. Especially when it is the one most referenced by any market news or commentary.

Do you have any market-makers lined up to be providing liquidity?

There are no limits on market cap, they will just slide with the overall value of the market. The medium sized assets are just the ones roughly ranked 11-30 (on a site like coin market cap) each month.

Is anyone aware of a service that is able to look at balances by wallet? I know there are some that search by address, but that doesn't really tell you much.

She will be irrelevant soon.

Welcome. It is nothing if not entertaining.

Any that you can reveal?

I sent my first wire to pay for some home repairs to an individual. Bank froze my account until I showed up at a branch with photo ID and handled the interrogation from the manager.
