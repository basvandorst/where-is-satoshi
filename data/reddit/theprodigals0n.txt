BTC takes forever to send plus Binance is swamped with ALTs pumping at the moment. You’ll have to wait until it goes through unless you have crypto funds in another exchange you can send over to its corresponding Binance wallet

Yea. Sometimes can take a few hours if the networks are jammed. Switch over to ETH before sending. It’ll be there in approx. 5 minutes. BTC takes forever. Hence, why BTC has scalability issues and so many hard forks that will eventually canabilize it’s growth.

If you believe in your investment speak to each individual parent alone that way they can’t gang up on you &amp; you’re more likely to win support (or at least sympathy) from one of your parents (without the other parent swaying his/her spouse’s decision). When you speak to the parent, don’t bitch, moan, complain, and/or whine. Speak calmly with certainty and confidence. Explain your belief/research in this investment and that you would like his/her support as this is the first decision you’ve come to on your own as a young adult &amp; they will not always be around to protect you from the risks/rewards of life. Let the parent know you have a plan to liquidate your investment if it falls below a certain point to minimize risk/loss. Let the parent know you’re a young adult and need to learn about the risks of life &amp; investing for yourself. If the investment fails, the loss will be minimal, you will have learned a valuable lesson, &amp; you know to put greater weight on their advice/experience in the future. If the investment remains stable and/or increases, you’ve learned that you need to trust your decisions and not to be easily swayed by those that don’t necessarily see your vision. This is common sense type stuff. You can’t expect your parents to ever truly respect you and/or treat you like an adult if you act/behave like a child &amp; don’t respect &amp; believe in yourself.

@_date: 2018-08-22 23:48:55
The major issue for ETF approval is that worldwide cryptomarkets aren’t nearly regulated enough to prevent manipulation/fraud. Implementing insurance to protect investors and raising the minimum amount for investment into an ETF still doesn’t address that manipulation/fraud concern due to the simple fact the majority of BTC is in foreign unregulated and private hands/markets/exchanges. We’ve taken positive steps this past year, but not enough to quell the concern of the old guard. Our only hope is that new SEC commissioners appointed down the line are more favorable toward man crypto &amp; that SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce (who is the newest of the current commissioners &amp; the sole voice of reason in allowing Bitcoin ETFs) becomes a leader that is able to push through a Bitcoin ETF. Try to be objective in your analysis and understand the politics at play. If you want, let’s use DBet on VeChain to wage whether the BTC ETF will be approved in March 2019.

I’m sure you can gift it now and lock it up via a smart contract with specific time parameters in the near future for same to be released to that person. As of 2018,  the annual gift exclusion amount is $15,000 so you do not have to report same and/or file a federal gift tax return if the crypto amount gifted is less than $15,000. 
The value of the crypto at the time it is gifted is the only price that matters for tax purposes. Many states have no tax on gifts (e.g. NY, NJ, etc.), while the Federal Government under the current tax code requires the gifter (and not the receiver) to pay taxes on the gift if same isn’t included in his annual gift and/or lifetime gift exclusion amount (lifetime gift amount currently stands at approximately $11 million per individual).

EDIT - way to edit your comment to make it clear you’re referring to the giftee selling after he received the gift. ���� Nice POS move. OP never once talked about taxes the giftee will owe after he received the gift. Way to backtrack. 
Genius, if it is gifted to the person any appreciation does not matter until that person sells the asset. But if you say so. 
As of the present, I can gift you and/or a trust where you are the sole beneficiary  a $11,000,000 Picasso or $11,000,000 piece of real estate free and clear in the State of NY. If in 60 years that painting or real estate is worth $100 million you won’t have to pay a dime in the $89 million in capital gains unless you sell it (unless you choose to utilize a 1031 Exchange for the property). I don’t know how to explain this more simply or clearly to you. But knock yourself out giving bad tax advice.

Right now rumors and panic are issues for Tether. Until we know USDTs books are clean, many people will assume Tether printed worthless USDTs for itself to buy cryptos to enrich themselves. This is a problem. Bitfinex/Tether need to have an audit to alleviate public concerns and this mass panic.

I don’t know... Where there’s smoke there’s usually fire. The majority of Tether has been created these past 2 months when the overwhelming majority of cryptos have lost approximately 50%-60% of their value. Whatever business model Tether ran on there is no way IMHO that Tether was able to consistently &amp; rapidly convert those cryptos that swapped into USDTs into US dollars when the values were plummeting at such rapid levels. Moreover, there are multiple other issues that need to be addressed to restore confidence in both Tether &amp; Bitfinex:
1. By its own admission &amp; marketing, Tether set the peg to the USD at 1:1. Tether was not supposed to be based on a fractional reserve system to the USD. It promoted itself as always having enough USD on hand to back every USDT it put into circulation. I don’t see how that is possible based on the collapse of the crypto market we’ve seen this past month &amp; we don’t have an audit to prove same. 
2. “Market Cap” versus “Capital Invested” are two very different things that can have two very different outcomes on the market. I understand Tether’s market cap is relatively small, but we do not know how USDT’s have been used/created in this market at this very moment. That’s scary. 
3. Without an independent audit to prove the necessary fiat currency reserves are on hand &amp; the clean functioning of Tether, how do we know that Tether hasn’t been printing USDT solely for the company &amp; its executives to buy legitimate cryptos  (e.g. BTC, ETH, LTC, etc.) with the worthless USDT to enrich themselves potentially leaving innocent investors holding the worthless Tether bags once USDT collapses. 
4. If Tether goes down then Bitfinex (one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world) most likely goes down with it shortly thereafter as Bitfinex’s name has become synonymous with USDT. 
5. Why did Tether end its independent audit by Friedman LLP? What did Friedman LLP find?

Nope. They were at 2.25 billion USDT now up to 2.28 billion USDT. I know. Been watching Tether for weeks because my one investing partner was suspect about them a month ago. I hit the panic button when I saw them printing hundred of millions of dollars worth of USDT in the past few weeks. The market will recover. If you’re in strong cryptos, you’ll be fine in a year or two (maybe sooner if Korea/India don’t ban and China reintroduces new crypto guidelines). I’m not worried.

Profit taking. Consolidation. Etc. Nothing goes straight up. BTC went from testing its bottom of 6,000 to almost doubling to break through $12,000 in about 2 weeks. Relax. As long as BTC is taking 2-3 steps forward and only 1 step back then all is right in the world. If BTC stays above $10,000, then I’m happy. We can rise organically from there with $10,000 as our new support level.

I didn’t say law. No new laws have been passed by Congress. The financial institutions themselves have changed their rules/regulations regarding crypto purchases. You can easily research/look it up yourself, but I’ve included some links below. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:04:28
GDAX/Coinbase gives me instant crypto purchases from my bank account. With the new rules/regulations, you cannot make crypto purchases from your debit/credit card from many financial institutions and/or are limited to the cash advance amount. Visa &amp; MasterCard and most large US Banks (e.g. Chase, BoA, Capital One, etc.) will block it. Their fraud model does not take into account credit/debit card purchases of cryptos due to the high risk of fraud, theft, and total loss in the crypto markets (e.g. Prodeum, BCC, etc.). 
If you only have funds to invest into crypto from borrowing on your credit card then you shouldn’t be in the market. If you do not have instant purchases from your checking account, then wait a week for the checking account crypto purchase to clear. If you refuse to wait a week for your crypto purchase to clear, because you do not have long term confidence in that crypto purchase then you shouldn’t be in the market to begin with because it’s clear you are solely in this to day trade, speculate, and gamble with $ you cannot afford to lose. 
Personally, I’m glad these new regulations/rules are helping to clear out and make the barriers for entry/re-entry harder for day traders, gamblers, speculators, investors playing with money they cannot afford to lose, and traders that don’t necessary believe in the long term prospects of the cryptos they purchase. Good riddance to bad rubbish.
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:11:49
IMHO China will reintroduce BTC/crypto trading in the near future (approx. 1-2 years or less). China instituted the total crypto ban because it’s most likely in the process of instituting heavy controls/regulations to ensure it has total control of its crypto markets before reintroducing same. Before the total crypto ban, China’s crypto markets were essentially unregulated. This framework adversely affected national currency reserve and capital investment issues/concerns through easing the ability of money laundering and capital outflows. China had to put an end to this and get its totalitarian hands around crypto before re-allowing crypto to flourish/trade. Once China reintroduces crypto, it will most likely only embrace: (1) centralized cryptos; (2) non-privacy cryptos; (3) business enterprise focused cryptos; (4) utility cryptos; (5) cryptos that do not aim to directly challenge/replace fiat currency in a decentralized manner that its government cannot control or openly monitor/track; and (6) “store of value” cryptos. China isn’t dumb. It recognizes that crypto is now being embraced (if not cautiously) by many of the world’s economic powers and it will not be left behind. 
Japan, the US, and the EU/UK are taking a “do no harm” approach that includes sensible regulations/controls. It’s clear they envision the crypto market/funding model becoming a sort of NASDAQ 2.0. More than any other major economy, Japan has gone “all in” on crypto. Japan sees crypto as the future &amp; won't make the same mistake it did in the 1990s when it was left behind during the internet/mobile/software tech boom. Furthermore, as we have seen from the US Senate hearing, the US sees real value/benefits in cryptos and will cautiously embrace/regulate same to ensure organic growth &amp; protect investors. Moreover, the UK/EU has taken a similar approach to the US (as the UK/EU have no choice but to continually compete against NYC &amp; Hong Kong to remain in the financial capitals/hubs of the world). IMHO Russia will never institute a wholesale ban on cryptos as Russia needs this tech to move funds due to US financial sanctions on Russia’s high net worth citizens, government officials, and to challenge the petrodollar. Economic powers in the Middle East (e.g. UAE, etc) are also in the process of embracing crypto. In addition, while South Korea may also have similar concerns as China in regards to money laundering, cash reserves, &amp; cash/capital outflows, it’s clear even South Korea is starting to come to terms with the reality of the turning crypto tide. This essentially encompasses the vast majority of economic power in the world openly embracing crypto.
China is no fool. Much like its extreme control/regulation of the internet &amp; social media (e.g. “Great Firewall”), China is most likely in the process of setting up the regulatory/compliance framework to ensure its total control of domestic crypto markets to limit capital/currency outflows that can negatively impact its economy and currency. Even with the ban, China is still in business/partnership with many cryptos to build its tech cities/hubs of the future such as “the crypto that cannot be named” and WTC (amongst others). If China doesn’t embrace crypto trading/tech in the future, it risks Hong Kong losing its seat asa world hub/capital for the financial/asset markets. I do not see China willingly ceding this position. 
Have no fear. Crypto will be coming to China once again in 1-2 years (or less), albeit highly regulated/controlled by the government.  “I wish you good fortune in the (crypto) wars to come.”

In a 2 week period, we hit a bottom of $6,000/BTC and then went on to press $12,000/BTC before this pullback. After a recovery/run of that nature some pullback, profit-taking, and consolidation is normal.  As long as BTC is taking 2-3 steps forward before every 1 step back, then who cares.
