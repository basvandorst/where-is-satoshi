I'm surprised that the poles break so often. I would have thought that they are well calibrated with the athlete's weight.

Yeah, takes some guts to launch yourself like that.

Compared to what?

This seems like a sort of negative "no true Scotsman" fallacy. What could he say that would satisfy you that he is *not* Satoshi? If he demonstrated some significant knowledge of Bitcoin, wouldn't that be more suspicious?
Perhaps his reticence can be explained by his being more or less forced into retirement due to age or health, and he feels slightly embarrassed. Maybe he just a private person that doesn't want to give a public account of his life? Maybe he just doesn't care about bitcoin and wants to get back to fucking around with model trains?

If the story were more convincing, it's reasonable to think his life would be in danger. [This sort of shit does happen]( from time to time.

Actually I think the key was "more convincing". If enough people believed he was *the* Satoshi, somebody somewhere would go after him. He would be sitting on a half-billion or so worth of undefended bitcoin. The reward in the case I linked to was far less, and the risk greater. The whole situation concerning Bitcoin is a "lightening strike".
As it turns out, most people who spend more than 5 mins reviewing the "evidence" will conclude that Dorian had nothing to do with Bitcoin, and I agree at this point the risk is pretty low. That said, what Newsweek did was irresponsible and dishonest. The only thing saving Dorian from more hardship is that they were wrong.

How many didn't die from buying on the street instead, which generally has more impurities/greater risk?

He likely did. It's on a tripod and you can see it bounce and come to a rest after he lets go.

You can see the camera bounce a little and come to a rest on the tripod as the cameraman presumably let go and ran.

I did a test drive. I'm used to acceleration on my motorcycle, but it was strange to feel something that large accelerate that fast.

Ah, sorry, not intended.

Sure, it makes sense at times, but generally forex sites use the base unit, and I was thinking more from a UX perspective: it's adding "noise" to the screen without adding information.
Anyway, I get the psychological argument, and you can change it under preferences so it's more or less moot.

That's awfully cynical. On the other hand, the recent rally started roughly around the time they changed it.

What's the advantage, exactly? It now takes an extra character to show the same thing.
edit: It was a sincere question. Please explain rather than down vote.

Reminds me of when the talking heads were scoffing at the Web. "HTTP? What does that even mean??"

Did you actually watch the whole thing? He is pro-technology and makes that pretty clear in his closing statements.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:55:47
...so it takes an extra character without adding information. E.g. 1141 (4 chars) becomes 1.141 (5 chars).
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:43:38
It's mathematically equivalent..?

There weren't any Victorian beliefs in the 18th century.
