My account was terminated several months ago before the agreement even changed. I was told that my account may be linked to fraudulent activity and they terminated my account. They gave me a hard time trying to withdraw my btc too, said I would need to wait 6 months for them to investigate the source of funds and bitcoins if I wanted to withdraw the btc from my account. I tried to dispute it, but they simply wouldn't respond. I had 2 BTC in the account at the time and I've made thousands of payments there without any issues before, then one day account terminated. In the end I was able to withdraw my bitcoins, but definitely wouldn't recommend this site.
I waited the 6 months and sent them another email, at which point, they let me withdraw funds and then closed my account for good. During the entire time and presently, I am unable to login to the account, saying something along the lines of additional information is required and to contact support.

I don't mean to necro this thread, but I have this issue as well. I had a friend of mine send me a little over 1 BTC recently because he owed me money, and circle randomly suspended my account with bitcoin on the account. The bitcoin didn't even come from circle, so they essentially robbed me off $230+ (current price of BTC) and won't let me get access to my funds or anything. Would definitely stay away from Circle, use another bitcoin exchanger instead.
