You really need to stop thinking about bitcoin in terms of one bitcoin...just buy what you can and it doesn’t matter how much that is.  Very few people buy one bitcoin or a time, and there is no prestige owning one whole on.  There is not even a physical whole bitcoin.  It’s just bits!  Just a unit of measure for pricing and selling purposes.  That  seems like the main thing you don’t get.  Any small amount per week you invest is good.  It will add up.  It’s silly to not save money if you don’t have a certain amount to save.  
But if this is all you are saving, I would caution you to put some money aside that is not in Bitcoin.  You need 6 months of income put aside ideally in case of Emergency, and that should not be in crypto.  So maybe save half in crypto and  half in the bank, or somewhere that is is liquid.  If you read about what is going on here lately with transaction times and exchanges, there are sometimes glitches in getting your money back fast.   Don’t put what you might need in the near future in bitcoin!

There is a reason everybody says HODL.  We are not sheep... that is honestly the best thing to do.  You buy it and don't try to be a day trader.  It will go way up, it will go way down.  Long term, we believe it will be worth quite an it more than it is now.  But it is not a get rich quick scheme like some want to think it is.  You should invest money that you don't need, you might lose it all but chances are you will gain.  Just don't take it out for a few years no matter what.  And enjoy the roller coaster ride. But read read read about it and you will understand why each crash is happening.  And then you will have faith that it will come back up.
