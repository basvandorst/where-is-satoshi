Is that the evidence or is there more?

Didn't Satoshi sustain the network in the early days with hashing power equivalent to a supercomputer or a large network of near-supercomputers? I recall reading discussion about this on bitcointalk. Specifically, a conspiracy theory that Satoshi must have been working with a government agency to have access to that much computing power. 
Perhaps he really did have his own supercomputer(s)...
If I can find the link, I'll update this post with it.

1301/0.005 = 260,200 coins in cold wallets. Do you really think BFX is holding that many coins?

BFX claims 99.5% of its customers' coins are stored safely in cold wallet(s). As of this post, the hacker's wallet shows over 1500 stolen coins from BFX's hot wallet.
So, BFX is holding over 300,000 coins in cold wallets (1500/0.005)? I find that hard to believe...
Hacker's wallet: 
Looks like BFX might actually hold hundreds of thousands in cold wallets.
