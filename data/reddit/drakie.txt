there's 3 keys but they're stored in 4 locations;
 - user has one
 - bitfinex has one
 - bitgo has one
 - bitfinex has the bitgo or user key also stored as 'backup' somewhere, but which one?

I agree with this, if you've found a way to contact the owner, sweep and offer to return them, if you get lucky he might give you a finders fee

there's a fair chance you might have had too low of a fee, check out your TX on  and if it did then there should be a note saying 'low fee' (or 'no fee')

receiving bitcoins doesn't require any action, if they have an address then you can send bitcoins there and when they open their wallet to spent their bitcoins at any given time the bitcoins will be there.
ofcourse opening their wallet will require internet access and so will spending.
 assuming they want to change it back into cash they'll have to go into the city to spend/sell their bitcoins anyway...

almost all companies in the bitcoin space don't care that much about people figuring out their addresses so most of them do little to no effort on hiding their traces.
and many of the gambling sites have on-chain dice games (like satoshidice etc), which are even easier to track since they actually ask you to send your BTC to an address to initiate the bet.
blocktrail.com actually tags the stuff that is identifiable as much as possible, so that people hopefully will learn to understand that bitcoin both offers anonymity and transparency depending on how you use it.
@_date: 2014-09-03 14:59:11
for 1 BTC I can fake 10k transactions, if everyone would use this chart to determine how well bitcoin is doing then it would be pretty easy for me to generate a spike and then sell my other 99 BTC at a lot higher rate ;) 
I actually dare to say that this might already be happening at a certain scale but you're right that as long as it's a constant factor the chart is a fairly decent indicator :D

@_date: 2014-09-12 16:21:23
this often happens when someone using the bc.info wallet creates a transaction that has no fee or a fee that is too small. 
then the transaction will propagate poorly and many nodes won't receive the transaction, thus many other blockexplorers and wallets won't show the transaction unless it gets mined by a miner that somehow did get it.

if I would be a very wealthy person and would somehow manage to legally guarantee everyone that on 1st of January 2016 they could sell their BTC for $2000 then the price would of course never drop below 2k until that moment and potentially go higher than 2k...

what kind of wallet is it? 
@_date: 2015-05-18 16:53:40
Monitored Output
The wallet's output should be easy to monitor. It must not be opaquely encrypted (e.g. going through TLS connection to wallet provider's server). Communication should be either in plain text, or encrypted deterministically based on master secret and user-provided data. If the device has multiple methods of output (wired, bluetooth, wifi etc), all of them must be documented and equally auditable.
Note that data stored on disk must also be auditable and therefore compliant with this specification.
can you be more specific about "the wallet's output" ?
I don't think it makes sense that you're recomending not using HTTPS for communication with any server ... 
@_date: 2015-05-03 17:01:08
it's combined with existing heuristics such as the assumption that Bitstamp does not do coinjoins and thus all inputs are the same owner 
@_date: 2015-05-19 08:36:05
your spec of Master Seed does not really allow BIP39 the way I read it ... considering that is the standard (and imo a good standard) maybe you should adjust it ...
@_date: 2014-08-23 16:32:16
VAT tax laws are very old and very specific to which stuff is and isn't VAT exempt (money, stock, airmiles), many people have tried but Bitcoin can't fit into any of the categories currently defined.
So selling Bitcoins should be VAT taxed.
However in Germany, The Netherlands and the UK (the ones that I've heard of) there's work in progress to make an exception for Bitcoins until the EU laws are updated (which is SLOOOOOW).
@_date: 2014-09-13 09:38:57
hmm I hadn't seen that you said it had confirmations. 
0 confirmation TXs can easily be affected by bugs and other odd situations, but once confirmed - coming from someone who build a competitor blockexplorer ( - I'm pretty damn sure that in a normal case there shouldn't be any bugs in our (or others such as blockr or biteasy) system that would prevent the TX to show up! 
what could be the case is that there was a fork at the time that you made your transaction, in which case some blockexplorers display a different block as the current block. 
but afaik we haven't had a fork longer than 1 block for a long time, so if the TX had 2+ confirmations then this wasn't the case either. 
plus the chances of this happening to you twice are very small... 
if you gimme a TXhash or poke me on IRC (rubensayshi) if it happens again I can investigate a bit more ;)

stealth addresses is I think what you're looking for, but it's gonna take awhile for wallets to support that 
@_date: 2015-05-18 16:50:33
I suggest you remove the coin control part from your spec, some wallets (like Armory for example) have more complex automated coin selection that is better for privacy, your spec would require wallets to choose a lesser algorithm just to have it deterministic.
without going to much into detail, Armory (and our wallet mimics their algo more or less - BlockTrail) generates 10~20 different possible selections of UTXOs, a mix of:
 - oldest UTXOs
 - biggest, smallest
 - random
 - and some of the above excluding the 1st, 2nd etc.
and then scores the selected UTXOs, on privacy and optionally also on w/e or not it would result in a high priority TX.
it takes into account for example that having 2 inputs from the same address leaks less privacy than 2 inputs from different addresses.
or that if the resulting outputs have less difference between each other (or if the amount of trailing 0s are equal) then it also leaks less privacy.
@_date: 2014-09-12 18:01:54

hehe, it's "assess" I guess? ;-)
@_date: 2015-01-28 10:31:59
Confirmations are required to be able to assess the chance of the transaction being double spend and the merchant getting screwed over.
People who think confirmations need to be 'fixed' should wake up and realise that the bitcoin protocol without smart layers on top of it as the one of OP is not made for buying coffee as the security from bitcoin is build around the concept of blocks and confirmations.
Hell, there's no reason at all why you'd need to have the whole bitcoin network acknowledge spending $2 anyway, using bitcoin for small transactions is overkill, it's not worth it, if you want to get away with a free cup of coffee then running is a lot more logical than double spending anyway xD
@_date: 2015-05-03 19:30:52
it's not in bitcoinjs, the user of the library is responsible for adding the outputs in random order
@_date: 2015-05-03 19:33:20
true, but p2sh growth should help eventually cover it... 
I tried analyzing purely on that initially and ran into some transactions that made it hard to create a reliable algorithm, or at least I threw more warnings that I was comfortable with 
@_date: 2015-05-03 17:12:00
yea, only usable for when qt was more or less the only wallet though, unfortunately :p
@_date: 2017-03-10 07:51:21
Bitcoind keeps a decaying average of the fee required for a 75% chance for a transaction to be confirmed within N blocks. 
it does not look at mempool at all.  
So transactions need to be confirmed for them to influence fee estimations.
 Many other wallets do look at the mempool though.
@_date: 2016-01-26 10:33:15
I've implemented segwit for bitcoinJS in my spare time in the past weeks and it really wasn't that hard to do, the signature hash changes are very straight forward and moving the scriptSigs into a the witness space of the TX is not hard either.
most of my time was 'waisted' because I started while the BIPs weren't finalized and they still made (big) changes and lacked some info in the BIPs and I had to dig through the c++ code for the details (and I waisted a day because I had a debug statement that was messing things up)

1. there are many other use cases for smart contracts other than usage with a crypto currency.
2. they'll be able to work with Counterparty assets, so any asset that has value can be used. (a couple are traded on exchanges like poloniex.com, including ofc the Counterparty native currency XCP).
3. btcrelay.org will also be able to run on the Counterparty EVM, allowing you to get some bitcoin related information.
and because Counterparty nodes have direct access to the bitcoin blockchain some of this functionality could actually be made available natively in the future.

@_date: 2016-11-30 21:10:29
just Google for "SPV mining"...
this is a "natural" result of how long it takes to validate a block and miners SPV mining in the meantime. 
this is EXACTLY why we need segwit before any blocksize increase hard fork and why we shouldn't carelessly increase the block size. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 13:11:51
I'm sorry but this is just a general thing in software development, developers go through a couple of cycles of thinking they know everything and then their bubble bursts and they learn they know nothing. 
to illustrate, almost every graduate will tell you he "masters" X languages and X technologies and can easily learn to master any new ones. 
only to being hired shortly after to sell 5 Wordpress blogs per week. 
this repeats itself everytime you push into something that challenges you and seems obvious to me (as some1 who feels he's at the point of having their bubble burst not too long ago) that the people who are trying to split from core either just don't realize this or think they've stepped into the final layer... 
@_date: 2015-08-21 02:40:15
the calculations by Gavin for the 20mb were off, he fixed it and it became 8mb, after that you guys have been spearheading 8mb and it has felt as if there was never an opening for a compromise.
the gap between 1mb and 17% year over year (the most conservative proposal) and 8mb (the most controversial proposal) is pretty big and not once have I seen you or Gavin suggest anything like making a compromise on the number you've chosen.
if it's arbitrary, why not 4, specially if that might just get you a lot more support ... 
@_date: 2015-08-20 22:12:28
why dont you and Garvin compromise on BIP101, a lot of arguments against it are that the jump is too big, why not 4mb?
personally I feel that if you might have been more open to a compromise earlier we wouldn't have moved into this deadlock of everyone being so damn stubborn and keeping their foot down, maybe a compromise from your end might loosen things up a bit and it will definitely convince a very big part of the community, including many technical/business people. 
8mb is about as far of from the 1mb that anyone can even begin to justify, why take the biggest imaginable leap? 
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:13:02
it does not imply that at all, we need to create a double spend to split the coins, this can be either done with RBF trickery or by getting a miner (on either chain) to help us ensure we get a double spend going.
regardless of which chain our pool(s) will be operating on it will work ;)
@_date: 2017-09-12 10:10:41
as you guessed right, we'll mix with coins that are split, preparing both an RBF solution and one using our own mining pools to double spend to.
once we've got a couple of UTXOs that are split we can mix them with more UTXOs and continue from there on without requiring any extra effort.
wallets will also, once they contain some UTXOs that are split, naturally split more of their UTXOs whenever a transaction uses multiple UTXOs.

@_date: 2015-09-12 18:19:04
yea they are.
the wallet uses your existing Blocktrail (explorer/developers) account, but atm you can't login to both the wallet and the explorer in 1 go.
this is due to how the wallet works, completely in the browser etc, it's not an easy thing to do.
right now you have to login specifically on the devs/explorer platform, here; 
and then the bookmarks are still in your dashboard; 
we'll work on making it possible to login to the devs/explorer platform at the same time as the wallet upcoming, so it will be less confusing!
and we'll also do another round of polishing on the explorer UI, because the new design brought some issues with where to position things (ie; putting back the bookmarks link in the navbar when you're logged in)
but I can promise you by the end of next week we'll have dealt with all of that!
@_date: 2015-09-12 17:59:39

atm the only way is using a PHP script that's available as part of our SDK for developers: 
the way the wallet has been build it shouldn't require more than a few days to also release a desktop version (the hardest part will be packaging so it can be installed easily etc).
that desktop version will contain an easy way to use your backup sheet to get your bitcoins out of the wallet (we'll probably code in insight and another alternative API for it).
I also asume in case of major problems with Blocktrail that there will be some developer in the community who would create a small website that can help ppl get their BTC out, so far the community has proven itself rather helpfull when others are in dire straits.
@_date: 2015-09-11 07:09:44
I'd strongly recommend against paying without fee, even if it's "high priority" it could take hours if not days to get confirmed! 
bitcoin fees are so low, gimme your address, tell me the fee that your wallet says it needs to pay and I'll send you enough to cover it! 
as for the wallet not being able to send, you should contact greenaddress, they're a professional company, they should have a support email or smt on their site! 
@_date: 2015-11-16 09:49:12

the "normal" wallet is build on top of our developers platform and uses the same technology, they're both 2of3 multisig HD wallets where the user owns 2 of the 3 keys.
so worst case there's scripts on our SDKs that can be used to sweep a wallet without blocktrail (or blocktrail's servers).

source of SMF Profile-Modify.php line 2669 - the uploaded file is copied to the upload directory and is not deleted if it fails to validate the image, which would be the case if you'd upload a PHP script instead of an image.
because on line 2679 it instantly returns 'bad_avatar' ...
those files can be accessed easily on /attachments/avatar_tmp_&lt;member_id&gt; and depending on the PHP / NGINX config it's possible that it is executed (as described by some other people in this topic already)!
from there on it's very easy to modify anything they'd like.
