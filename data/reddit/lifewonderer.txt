Ancient or modern or whatever ... one uses what is practical in a given setting :)

This post is not about anyone's fault. It is simply observing what went through one's mind.

Try telling this to the millions of people in India and Africa who do not qualify for bank accounts but have mobile phones.

Are there any major universities in the U.S. that have started accepting bitcoin for donation purposes? If not, why not?
@_date: 2014-06-21 02:21:26
True...and you might say I am old relative to the average Bitcoiner age :) but seriously, I generally use credit cards for payments. But Aldi does not take credit card and who carries so much cash around?
@_date: 2014-06-21 02:32:49
Yes...so finally, I applied for a debit card with my credit union. Never needed it in 20+ years.

I normally use credit cards for payments. But Aldi does not accept my credit cards. hence, check

Really found this very interesting. Andreas gave outstanding answers that would be hard to improve upon. Two new points that could be made: National governments can play a role by not just providing clarity and not regulating bitcoin but 1) also by providing new grants and incentives to companies that wish to do innovative R&amp;D in this space and 2) by educating and training new consumers, the unbanked and the banked.

1. Offer customers a 2% discount (or some portion of what you save from not having to pay a credit card company) if they agree not to bring it back for refund. The sure customers will take it, especially if the discount works to be a large amount (psychology at work :)
2. If customer wants the option to return and does not take the discount, time stamp the USD/BTC value on the receipt at transaction time. In the event of a return, refund the customer USD cash minus an appropriate BTC exchange fee which is a fixed percent computed from the difference between the USD/BTC value at return time vs buy time. The exchange fee will be such as to discourage returns solely for the purpose of using your store as an exchange. 
Having the above two policies may minimize customer complaints as well as abuse, and give your store the other additional benefits of getting new BTC customers, marketing, credit-card commission savings, etc. And BTC paying customers who are not interested in returns will appreciate the 2% discount!

Thanks all!

True...I was not aware of detailed store policies such as the $75 max by check. The post is simply observing what went through one's mind.

That's like saying: I have no food to eat and no clothes to wear but if someone were to give me food or clothes, I run the risk of them being stolen ;)

If I have 1 BTC in a cold paper wallet, what's a way to directly transfer .5 BTC into one address and .5 BTC to a different address, both destination addresses being mine?

I think you have a major real-world problem in the human/technology interface area that can be simply stated as: How can various audiences understand and use a revolutionary technology such as bitcoin?
To study this issue, one might explore different dimensions/types of audiences (literate, technical, young, risk-taking, etc.), theories of paradigm shift, user psychology, framing, understanding of unknowns from knowns (e.g., use of metaphors and interface design concepts), learning theories, technology adoption theories (e.g., Technology Acceptance Model theories), and so on. You might compare perceptions of different types of audiences: existing bitcoin users, people familiar with bitcoins who are not technologically sophisticated, people who understand technologies but have little understanding of bitcoin, illiterate people, etc....you get the idea.

So if one has a beach-front property in Brazil, is one required to file FBAR? Is bitcoin property or is it treated as currency for FBAR purposes? Any clarity on this question or has it been left ambiguous?
@_date: 2014-06-18 03:54:13
So how do we file a claim? Have some folks already done this?
@_date: 2014-06-21 02:22:06
Or they still have not explored or are in the process of exploring the bitcoin option?

What issues did you face in trying to bring this documentary out, as it seems over a year has elapsed since you filmed this?

Fair and balanced way to understand and explain Bitcoin!  Question about: "On Day 1 of Bitcoin, it had no infrastructure layer. I can tell you, as an entrepreneur in this space for the past few years, Bitcoin’s infrastructure layer is now substantial." 
So how easy is it to tweak this infrastructure layer to accept altcoins?

In a way, it is not weird because of the karmic nature of money. It is the recognition of the fact that nothing is ours fundamentally speaking and whatever we get we share with others, whether it is money, thing, or knowledge....
the circle of life!

Thanks for a detailed report. Am curious how your government looks at bitcoin and Bitcoin. Are there clear policies and regulations?
