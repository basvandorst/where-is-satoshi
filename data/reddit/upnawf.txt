Oh I’ve seen the Tesla racing vids they’re like sliding on fucking ice it looks like, the acceleration is incredible but I’m not counting the roadster yet lmao hasn’t come out

Yeah but if you’re a gas engine fan nothing compares to hearing it and feeling it

Those shitty loud cars are pushing 400hp and weigh nothing though
And I said GTR nismo if that’s a shitty loud car well then there’s no conversation to pursue

My first comment said GTR, but I honestly love the sound of any built car even if it’s a 90’s civic eventually electric cars will be what’s in but it’ll take longer than people think cause keep in mind the oil industry makes a lot of money
My bad didn’t realize this was a different comment thread but I mentioned it somewhere on here

I just don’t see it going under 5k again probably even 8k it’s too hot now but I mean I’m open to another bear market in the future so we can do this all over again ��
