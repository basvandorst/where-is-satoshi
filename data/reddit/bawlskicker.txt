I thought that too but i did the following
1. Check the traders number, majority of them are throwaway number
2. Most have "National Bank" on the transactions but a few have the correct name. So what the f is "National Bank"?
3. The forum everybody claims to got conned by traders with with over 1000+ ratings
4. The location of the traders are general area which is ok, but some is listed in middle of highways where no human reside..even dogs
5. Some states, they bank name is listed a town/state.!
I strongly believe this is a scam site.

Localcoins.com is a strange site. The listing show generic bank names like "national bank" which doesnt exist in my country. If it is referring to the country's main bank, the country's national bank does not deal with individuals, just the local banks. Furthermore when i use a proxy, the name of the country changes, example "national bank singapore" or national bank india" or natioanl bank vietnam". In the transactions listing where every other info stays exactly the same as before, just country's name change.
What gives?

"Bob" found a hacker in the system. Bob gave "access" to hacker to steal. Bob stold bitcoins because he already setup Rovion to take all the blame only problem is, Rovion did not start stealing immediately so Bob started stealing too early. Rovion gladly gave up Bob because he realise that he got setup to take all the blame.

I stand corrected, localcoins.com maybe a legit site but not the traders.  And yes i did called the number of the traders, most is not in service anymore, the ones that work dont know what bitcoin is. One number belong a  kid, but localcoins.com reported him trading over 15K !
Well, we all just becareful then. Thanks anyways.

And I am doubly envious of you. Theres a note in Circle that says"Currently we only accept US and UK..." for all transactions. Well, for people like me living in worlds shtholes, no bitcoin for us.

Everybody here talk like bitcoin grows on trees! My gawd people, where do you get bitcoins? Some use lesser mortal can only dream of seeing one bitcoin. The most bitcoin i ever have in my possession is 0.0012btc and thats from monthssss of farming on crap to the power of twentyfive rig. Some parts of the world like the shthole i am living in, the price of S7 can feed a family of five for a year, electricity is a luxury and bitcoins are elusive. I guess one from countries such as mine, you get people saying in  "just for learning purpose" or "i have free electricity" so as not to be shot down by elitist bitcoin owners with phrases like "dont bother, just buy bitcoin" or " you be long dead before you can dream of roi". 
.....and people here seriously talks about spending bitcoins on online games! Wow, power to everyone of you. Seriously. I can only be envious.

Bitgold is too stupid to realise, if their customers have thousands of dollars, what stopping them from spending another thousands of dollars to hire someone to remove them and their family permanently to stop further thefts.

Dang it. I just realize my intelligence level is found wanting. When i saw the headline i was expecting something more like, shutting down bitcoin TODAY scenario. Looks more slow process of character assassination and stopping support. Whats more my line of thinking would be EMP the planet.
