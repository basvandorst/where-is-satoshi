But... It hasn't been a year. He came to us in December or November 2018. Not saying I don't support him. Even him uttering the name Bitcoin can help the cause rather than not saying anything. But he isn't the one we looking for, chief.

He came to my school last year December. He doesn't know a thing about Blockchain and couldn't answer how he is planning on supporting the adoption of BTC and crypto in general. Didn't even know that Blockchain is supposed to be a distributed ledger. I think he uses Blockchain as a buzzword more than anything.

You aren't wrong, it's I'm talking about general skin tone of south and north. It's like Africa, northern Africa is a bit fairer in color while southern one is darker, also rich tend to have somewhat fair skin because they can afford to stay out of the sun and buy buety products and what not, but the entertainment industry does discriminate based on skin color, height and what not.

North is fairer in color, while South is bit darker and there are extremes in borh parts.

But BTC dominance is gradually decreasing. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 00:57:15
I dont know too much technicalities about BTC but isn't having a bank the exact opposite of what BTC set out to do in the first place? It's good that if someone is making money AND is making Crypto adoption more prevalent, but making a bank in the process just misguided the public about BTC's philosophy.
Just my 2 cents I guess.

Thats not nice. Unless you are joking of course. If he wants he can do tons of things to look better like plastic surgery etc just like other hollywood stars, but he is more concerned with being successful. Dont be hateful man
