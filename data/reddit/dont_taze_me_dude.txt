It's not a BIP because it's voluntary.

You know you can join any mining pool regarless of where you live/mine in the world. This doesn't decentralized mining but does decentralized Country/location monopolies which can prevent huge drops in hash power if banning becomes real.

What do I do to distinguish between segwit and non segwit TX ?

yes it's completely voluntary and would help (their investment) bitcoin grow faster.

Before the 2017 August upgrade yes. After the upgrade , doesn't look like it. I have no fucking idea why?

and only 15% of the bitcoin network upgraded to segwit
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:40:00
For what coin?
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:55:10
Screw it,i turned my PC monitor upside down, we're going backup.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:52:25
Stop being a dick. I'm pointing out that bitcoin(the entire network) cannot run on lighting network everywhere now because only a small % upgraded to segwit. Once its at %100 LN can be used everywhere.

Do you realize capitalism creates more centralization everyday? what do you think a huge corporation is. Unless its a co-op, corporations are top down hierarchical companies controlled by one or a few people. Co-op style corporations are bottom up. The workers hire and fire the bosses and ceo, and the pay is distributed much more evenly.  But down vote me anyways.

It's not a BIP bro. It's accepting less profit, albeit still a huge amount, but less so that bitcoin adoption grows faster. When the LN is up, let the free market (LMAO) do what it wants.

That's how much you know. It's the mining pool operator who decides not the miners. And that's my point, they can choose what they want to include.

If tx fees are 100$ and you save 75% then fees are still high. There needs to be hardly any unconfirmed txs, that will lower fees dramatically into pennies. Solution LN and probably bigger blocks.

they are just overloaded like most exchanges
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:24:32


wrong, transactions get cheaper when everyone uses segwit which cause less unconfirmed transactions (many unconfirmed tx = higher fees)
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:54:53
You can't. You have to 'load' a 'lighting wallet' first. Once this is confirmed in the bitcoin network (in a block) you can move your coins around on the lightning network.

No segwit, no LN.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:46:36
It already is.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:12:10
Not a good idea.  The bitcoin is only yours when you are in possession of the private keys. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:39:33

@_date: 2018-05-06 16:30:43
Ok I figured it out. The fact that everyone always says "only invest what you can afford to lose." but I still invested 2/3 of my life savings that I couldnt afford to lose, should tell you that I 'knew' bitcoin was not going away or value pushed down to zero (based on all the information that I have learnt about the bitcoin protocol. Also I am a programmer so I understand it at a technical level)
@_date: 2018-05-15 15:34:48

No. If you are a company that just mines, charge more. If you are a private citizen mining in your own home there is no price increase. We should strive for this around the world because it will decentralize mining big time!

They announced it yesterday.  It's official now.

Even bitcoin is still, albeit working great so far, a giant experiment.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:22:21
Quick call bitcoin price, he hasn't heard yet.

LIFE HACK: if you are about to declare bankruptcy, load up one last time on bitcoin, use as much credit as you can. Declare on social media that you got hacked and all bitcoin is gone. Declare bankruptcy through standard process. Hodl for 5-10 years. retire.

It costs about $5.5K to mine one bitcoin nowadays.

Patents are the complete opposite of decentralized or open source. It's all about 'it's mine, mine ,mine!" to make profit.
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:45:56
technical indicators never include future news events.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:02:09
I thought bitcoin was like gold and not stocks. Can you buy gold with a credit card?
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:30:25
Shame on you for making fun of a boy who has no arms and legs.

The $5.5K is approximate (depends where you live - electrical costs) IF you already have the latest ASIC miner.

The bitcoin bear market is turning bullish.
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:19:02
If the company gets paid in bitcoin, why not?

who knows what changes will be made to bitcoin in the future.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:04:45
Up or Down? yes!
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:47:43

@_date: 2018-02-15 20:26:54

@_date: 2018-02-08 18:14:03
hehe I'm up 1625% still
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:39:09
Currently the bitcoin protocol rules allow even a block with no transactions what so ever. It happens on a regular basis.
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:52:01
Is half  a percent a lot?

@_date: 2018-02-04 17:40:49
They want bitcoin to exist so the CIA can use it, and beleive me, they are.

@_date: 2018-02-07 17:43:33
Don't you get it??? its capitalism, makin profit comes first. They want poeple to visit their station/website so they can sell ads.  People do things they normaly wouldnt do in an economic system like capitalism where you are left on your own to make money.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:07:10
Bitcoin doesnt care what Goldman Sachs thinks
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:21:50
YES, other coins might need to make some adjustments like upgrading to segwit but almost any coin will be able to use a lightning network.

The whole cryptocurrency world, albeit working out great for over 9 years, is still a giant experiment.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:07:37
many dont think its money now but i buy shit with it allk the time.,
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:53:06

You cant buy any stocks with a credit card either. Gold not sure.
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:19:55
Post something like this: bitcoin will reach 100,00$ in 2018.
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:28:07
Our tax dollars at work.

I read you bud, but this sub is centralized. Do you see the irony?
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:37:45
Wow, they still dont understand bticoin?
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:28:27
you pay capital gains tax only(max per person for life 800k) once you reach the limit, anything more  is taxed as reguar income.
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:16:38
i bet its not a decentralized system
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:57:12
Eveytime I post insightful news, not about price, good or bad, the mods delete it or it gets zero votes. So i decided to post this as a test. The results speak for themselves.

35k is not clear in my books.

Whales use something much more weak in security, forget about their wallets. They use things that have proven themselves time and time again to have the most risk, it's called a bitcoin exchange,
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:38:53
Bitcoin was not designed to solve economic problems. However bitcoin can work in almost any type,
