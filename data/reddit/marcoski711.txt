Stop trolling, it isn't like asking that. 
I'm saying direct ur &amp; others' efforts into improving what people actually use.
Whilst coinmap data needs improvement, it isn't 'full of online only' - there's just too few merchants. It's worked fine for me finding places in Milan, Rome, London, buenos aires, and indeed for NOT going to places that no longer accept in NYC.

@_date: 2015-06-02 20:20:06
Not so helpful with eg GreenAddress wallet - you need to nLocktime txs just in case the service goes awol (they have a 2-of-2 multi-sig service where they hold one key). 
Especially in the Bitcoin community, PGP is the common sense solution.
@_date: 2015-06-03 02:58:16
I agree with your thoughts there, but green address is no more a 3rd party than say BreadWallet or mycelium (arguably less so in the case of mycelium actually). 
So still, pgp is the right thing to offer. It's opt-in, can be on an 'advanced' tab, all that stuff. They just need to action it already.

I wouldn't get them to install ANY wallet. They'll look at their phones and not listen to the most important part - your message. Edit down a video if you must show that aspect, and tell them you'll give them links at the end (I love breadwallet but a multi-platform option like Ninki or Copay would be better).
Making about your angle, presumably AML/CTF, not just about bitcoin per se.

I was hoping u'd read up on GreenAddress.it so I didn't have to type so much :)
Q2. every tx, they also email an nLockTime tx, already signed by the key they control, for the remaining coins in ur wallet, going to a non-GreenAddress addy under your control.
The nLocktime, eg ~30 days' blockheight, means u can't double-spend using a GreenAddress wallet, so they can guarantee 0-confirmation tx to merchants. Black &amp; white, no heuristics, it's very clean.
The nLockTime means that if they go dark, you still have your coins (after ~30 day delay, a reasonable compromise imho)
Coming back on topic, this is why opting out of these emails isn't feasible. Hope that helps.

The assertion that you need scarcity from limited blocksize to get mining-fee income is specious. 
You don't need almost no food supply for greengrocers to charge a profitable price-point. You need greengrocers to not sell goods at too low a price.
The 'difficulty' of food production, or of getting tx fees, does not revert to the mean, it's an independent factor. Thus miners can exclude low/zero-fee tx based on the market and their local economics; they don't need everyone hampered by a restrictive blocksize to achieve this.
Put another way, having a 1mb blocksize doesn't de-facto mean optimum decentralisation.
Where might I be wrong in this thinking?

Good ramble but I'd encourage you to support those merchants anyway. 
You can mitigate the 1% by either:
. Setting buy orders and let the volatility get them filled at some point; or
. Buying 102% to get rid of more of your filthy fiat, little by little; if you're long, you're long.

Here here. Also, I love this aspect of Bitcoin - people will find a solution. eg expat Somali taxi drivers earning a crust and remitting it back home, bitcoin gives them a way to do that, so they'll do it. And of course ML etc will then be able to hide within those transaction volumes.
So Bitcoin forces regulators to take a nuanced approach - they now cannot simply exclude an entire country because it's 'just too risky' and let people in poverty starve, or live breadline lives, outside of the mainstream media's gaze.
let us know how you got on?

No, you’re changing the meaning of ‘fungible’ to suit your narrative.
Im pro-privacy but to illustrate my point, I’ve paid for taxis and other services in USD, in non-US, non-dollarised countries. ie USD is fungible. Just because Charles Schwab or CB or some other service’s ToS wont accept my USD doesn’t make the whole suddenly non-fungible.
If you wanna talk financial privacy feel free, but don’t try to change the meaning of a word to sound fancy and authoritative - YOU don’t understand what fungible means.

You overestimate the balance of security vs privacy that future-mainstream users actually want, finding that is left as an exercise for Mark Zuckerberg. 
The exercise I leave for u however is to discover the easy-for-mainstream-user privacy solution that is available to use today (ie not stealth addresses etc) that means OP is bang on and the privacy objection becomes moot.

I heard yesterday of a bank refusing a company account simply cos one of the directors (no equity involvement) was a PEP. They just want low, low, low risk. Not a bitcoin related biz, so it just demonstrates their entire fear of any type of risk.
Another was a 1-hour interview to open an account for an 11-year old being abroad with relatives for the summer holidays. They did open it, but the cost they're putting into AML is nuts.
I think there will be a growing sub-strata of unbanked pretty soon; it will become a social problem of some degree; and this will be perfect driver for more diverse Bitcoin adoption.

I think it's on point, although we may be getting into semantics. Mainstream awareness is arguably here. If you offered your colleagues btc - eg to buy the beers or lunch for ur colleagues, where they pay the bill in fiat and u help them with a wallet and pay full bill to them in btc, you could do that easily several times and get 'em all started. 
6 months ago would have been a struggle and 12 months ago really impractical.
In that way I think it is 'just starting to take off' is on point.

You're downvoted because of your conceited tone.
To OP's question:


Sure there is - thousands of startups. If my $100 startup (read the book) pays me $10,000 in year 1, that's 10x (ie 1000%) growth. Perhaps I should account for my time in there too, but if in year 2 I can pay myself $100,000 then even allowing for my time we're somewhere between 1000% and 10,000%, even with a basic small business and nothing stellar (or lunar).
I also guess that your father is framing his thinking like 'a share' on a stock exchange where 1000% is pretty amazing. But there's a lot of huge% growth of businesses long before they IPO. Bitcoin is still really early...

No, it means they're funded from tax dollars accrued; or debt that can feasibly be repaid (eg a toll bridge that will repay its construction costs).

People do draw different conclusions from the same data all the time. For myself, I didn't think they were shady individuals, despite terrible PR (and JPY transfers weren't subject to the red flags affecting USD, they were getting really good).
However I did think that the recent character assassination Mark has had would disincentivise him to loan personal funds to the company in order to cover the losses.  
Perhaps (ie pure speculation based on the 'tragic violation of the trust' in the joint statement) he thought fuck it, can't cover 744,408btc anyway so screw all the haters let's fuck off with what's left.
I hope for bitcoin he hasn't done that. And also I hope for bitcoin that there isn't a lynch mob either as that would also discourage legit business people. They obviously have to share some of the blame with over-automation but let's face it, they (and therefore, we) were shafted primarily by the thieves.

Yes it's 'Shared Send' and not a successor afaik. From memory they had a charge but subsequently made it free to use.
My view is is it's not a question of 'if', nor even 'when', but 'how' they will regulate. So I'm not fighting regulation per se but trying my small bit to make it reasonably implemented, proportionate, and not based on a Stasi-like 'monitor everyone' approach which is just nuts (as well as unfeasible)

Hi Jeff,
I'm in Southampton and so far have got a few businesses to accept Bitcoin.


I got Prufrockcoffee.com started for example - the guys there just refer queries to 'see Tom' and Tom knows about as much you seem to. As electrodraco says, just be straight with people about what you know and how you see it.  There is no problem doing that.


Where I've been introducing more businesses to Bitcoin, for ones that like the idea but don't have the time/skills to get set up, I've arranged  to help with those services including website integration, security best practices, and awareness/advertising on forums, bitcoin maps and directories, etc. It's chargable but they'll also discuss terms &amp; conditions, invoicing, accounting, etc with you. *full disclosure - a mate is runs which is why I chose them, and I get a referral fee if you go with them.


Most bitcoiners will support Bitcoin companies and choose you over a non-bitcoin company. That includes SME bitcoiners paying their supply-chain. It will likely be a small %, but the main value to you could be simply educating yourself rather than the value of new sales. And if we're right about Bitcoin taking off, you'll be ahead of the curve and benefit more. Also I'm working on an estate agent friend of mine in Brighton area. No promises of course but estate agents would be good repeat business.
Either way do make it clear (eg text and/or bitcoin accepted here logo) on all routes that potential customers come into contact with you.  One use-case is pre-payment before you do call-out (that might be easier than training all your staff to accept it on-site anyway)


As others have said, Bitcoin is irreversible so that's not the main risk. However, your own security is a learning curve. Two basics are 1) don't trust yourself to 'think up' strong passwords - use a password manager like lastpass or keychain on Mac to generate them for you and 2) use two-factor authentication wherever possible. Security intro vid here: 
Finally, here's some links:

* point-of-sale - XBTerminal in London - 
* integration &amp; advice - Teamify in Southampton -

Yeah, it's exclusively about Bitcoin and fuck all to do with alts.
An analogy: if two Cold War East Germans are communicating secret from the Gestapo using their TITAN communicator, it means fuck all if the Gestapo are still able to monitor the entire people left with standard phone lines. Similarly, if everyone is using standard Bitcoin, then the privacy needs to be standard in Bitcoin.
Video is about spy work done on the 'bad guys', (in this case Cold War Gestapo, communists, 9/11 terrorists etc) getting turned onto the entirety of the state's own people (in this case, all Americans, every single one).

I read that bit as a carry trade done by individuals (if I've read it right) Yes, nuts for 'normal' bods to do but it does have its place.
For example - I have a fixed interest rate mortgage for next 3 years. Should I pay down principal or just buy btc with it? I'd still pay interest obviously. Max downside if btc goes to $0 is 3 years of effectively missed principal repayments. 
That downside might be recoverable if I get a real job at a bank, and there's still decades left on the mortgage over which to do it. Upside is disproportionately large tho.

Changing thread a bit I agree with you that there's still a role for banks, it's just a different market to the one they're in now. The ones that get it will remain (ABN, Fidor), the ones that hang on to the old market like a repeat of Blockbuster will get disintermediated and die.

Android's 'cs'prng had a flaw last year got discovered and people that generated their wallets on their phones did lose money from hackers exploiting the flaw. Android users that generated their wallets on their PCs didn't.

Sorry about the sarcasm - there's no doubt that improvements can and must be made. But the complexity, diversity and scale of patient, user and information journeys make this a *hard* problem. Not a tech problem. I'm sure there's no single panacea such as 'trezor'

They could have made a half-arsed attempt at a balanced approach and due channels would have refined the rough edges.

Sorry for late reply. I'm arguing that your OP didn't cover that at all: para 1 sets up the straw man, and para 2 that you quoted then makes an assertion without basis (other than the straw man of course...).  If instead you'd stated para 2 as your belief/position, and explained why, then we could start some discussion on the merits/dismerits etc, etc.


No it isn't, and that makes it hard to have meaningful dialogue on how much fraud the regulation really manages to stop vs the real costs of having it. For example, if Madoff was stopped at year 1, how do we account that benefit? Just 1 year's activity?  How much he actually ran his scheme for?  An average of how long &amp; how much that type of fraud runs for?  Conversely how do you account for losses from stifled innovation? I guess one could compare it with places that have minimal or ineffective regulation?

I think u are wrong. A commercial bank can have, say, $4 of assets - eg gold, govt bonds, etc. They can then give u a loan of $100 eg to buy a house or build an extension etc, meaning they've created $96 out of thin air that has gone into the real economy. It he mechanism is different but it isn't just central banks.
It gets worse too. Those assets could include say pool of sub-prime mortgages packaged up into a single security valued at $4.  That they then loan out with 4% capitalisation or less, creating another 96% and so on...

An idea - incomplete but just to get things started: backup servers in n jurisdictions. Pre-prepped, but unbroadcast on network, tx are sent to those servers, say every 24hrs. The tx transfer the value to those backup servers. If the primary gets seized/stops echoing back, the backups broadcast their respective tx. The one that 'wins' (ie the tx that gets confirms) has the users' funds, and a DNS updater script sees the confirmed tx and updates DNS records accordingly.
Lots of probs with this cos only partially protects against regulator shutdown. Backup company/LLCs need as well as servers. Doesn't protect at all against hacking/internal theft/fraud (increases the surface area in fact). But maybe gets the brainstorming going?...
@_date: 2014-07-03 12:46:52
This sounds pretty balanced approach. I've been happy with bitcoin-central to be fair. Yes a hack is bad, but almost everyone in btc world's growing up has been hacked, just a combatative PR doesn't help with the community. 
For me, I would accept that imperfection if the service is robust (ie they've learnt from previous errors), and governance is good (ie not another karpeles affair).  As with all things btc, be careful, dyor, etc.

If this might apply to your case then research it more - I think fix was to run it on the original OS X/safari version to get private key and then move all ur btc to a newly generated wallet.

That's just an assertion on your part (and others), and the insider angle assertion is near impossible to refute. However what we can say is that Ver has given away stacks of btc, always gives his time to get people started and prob most relevant is a btc believer to the core. 
Based on that I'm going to make the assertion that he's just cool with the risks, has enough buffer to take the hit if it doesn't work out and is just offering the other side of the trade for people who want out. You can disagree but you can't refute it.

The point isn't just unproven but also very much out for debate. 
Regulatory capture is a real issue. But so are tin-pot dictators that rape their countries for their own gains, exfiltrate the money, and buy houses for themselves in Kensington. Having regulated entities identify politically-connected people as 'high-risk' means there's a better chance of them being exposed, however imperfect such a solution may be.
There is valid debate over the efficacy of regulation vs just leaving an open door to this sort of thing. But your post didn't cover that, it was just a straw man.

Extortion. 
You shouldn't have everything on one USB. Have some in a separate USB wallet in a bank vault, and/or posted to a trusted friend (neither party needs to know passphrase, or even what it is). Very soon u'll be able to easily do m-of-n for spending instead of home brew solutions against this risk.
Cold-storage.

I'm with the halving argument on the basis of who miners are nowadays. CPU/GPU miners, as individual peeps, can make a speculative choice to mostly hodl/run up paper losses across months/quarters/years; mining enterprises paying off investment/power costs cannot. And the lower the price the more they need to sell.
That's why I think it'll have a big impact

You are right. I'm not being delusional. Risks remain, such as if I need to withdraw investment early (eg healthcare, lose job etc), the price could be much lower than today and you're fucked by being forced to turn a paper loss into a real loss.
But my point still stands - they're not mutually exclusive. Two years ago the risks were much greater. Today, I see the chances of Bitcoin failing as approaching zero. I simply cannot see it not happening (this is so give me some slack :)  
How much that impacts its price on the open market however - at the time you need to spend it on retirement or healthcare - is another thing entirely. I'm not saying the moon is guaranteed but 'not failing' and the math of fixed supply are nice things to go together.

It does have an indirect cost for bricks and mortar places. You have staff turnover and need to train newbies / re-train existing. Friction, apathy, pita, all take effort that isn't being spent on some other part of the business.
Imo we should all do more to spend bitcoin, ESPECIALLY at bricks &amp; mortar places. 
My thinking is that price drives the news drives adoption. The next wave will have new consumers 'instant-on' with great wallets and services, and no-where to actually USE it. However, because adding merchants has more lead-time, it would be better to actively support btc merchants on-going, ie spend time finding them, spending btc &amp; re-stocking instead of our own apathy of convenience.
Even just once a week goal would help a lot.

Emphatic no, it is *totally* logical. You're confusing 'no additional harm' with no *direct* additional harm. Of course it causes additional harm by sustaining a market for them, thereby incentivising more blood diamonds.
It doesn't matter what the length of time is, nor the rock itself. If someone is secretly selling 10-year old diamonds, and after due diligence I find out they're blood diamonds and don't buy them, I'm helping to disincentivise that market - as well as disincentivise the loss of liberty for the slaves in the blood-diamond mines.
If someone is selling 10-year old blood diamonds, and I buy them no-questions-asked, cos they're half the market price, then I'm still incentivising today's market and making a contribution to slavery today.
What if the market is one day dead, is it ok to buy those now 20-year old diamonds?  The ivory trade is (perhaps) more dead than blood diamonds, and no, even if you buy 100-year old antique ivory, you'll still be encouraging today's supply chain all the way back to today's poachers.

Tons of good news, adoption, tech, use cases and mainstream stuff, even Microsoft, none of which affects the price. 
Change of tone from central banks/govt. They want to tax gains, but still worried about loss of policy levers/control/consumer scams and 2 or 3 countries have outright banned it, none of which affects the price. 
Finally, there's obviously there's more sellers than buyers. Two main theories are 1) commercial, centralized miners from the asic race are forced sellers to pay running costs unlike days of yore 2) adoption via bitpay etc forces all that adoption onto the market as market orders

Constructive post. I disagree that raising bsl increases centralization. 
I believe the current mining centralization is a result of the ASIC bubble - over-paying for a short-term lead in hashing 'for profit' - hashing that will always revert to the mean. Whilst no-one mines in order to lose money, we previously had enthusiasts that mined 'for the network', without the additional overhead of cost of money (debt or investors' 10%+ IRR etc). Or it may centralize to lowest cost of cooling. A number of factors at play but fixing it directly to bsl has never sat right with me.
A second factor is miners need the majority of use to be on the blockchain in order to build up fees, and NOT on LN or other layer 2 networks which take those fees away from miners. IMHO they're a good fit for niche use-cases, eg micropayments, but Bitcoin is best when majority of people are using it for the majority of their financial activity. 
And I hope we're all looking forward to that outcome, even if there's disagreements on how to get there?

Interesting insights. The outliers who build a free product and monetize much later (Twitter, FB, etc) are just that - extreme outliers. I wonder if another lesson to draw for the rest of us is split yourself between building &amp; sales? Say 80/20 during alpha, and 20/80 thereafter?

That article got my hopes up before I visited last year but it's not as good as the impression it gives.

Yes, it's really not a problem at all, and all the naysayers about this really tire me out.
1) All the payment processors have heuristics so they can handle 0-conf tx with FAR less risk than even cardholder-present CC fraud for example. CC fraud risk is passed from the processor onto the merchant btw. In the CC early days one might have beaten a drum that that would be a big problem, but CCs have done just fine.
2) Greenaddress.it solves the 0-conf non-problem for the naysayers at a stroke. Read up on their 2-of-2 model and Instant confirmation. No payment processor needed. Plenty of shops say 'no 50 or 100-dollar bills', or no cards, or no AMEX or whatever suits them. 'No high-value sales without instant confirmation' fits in the same mould.
It's a non-problem. Get over it.
@_date: 2015-04-08 23:36:03
I think they all should. Especially things like wallet providers and such like. We've spent all this time with wallets not reusing btc addresses and suchlike, and then when I sell some some btc I get a plaintext email notification containing full details from both the service provider &amp; greenaddress (my most recent example).

Two related ideas: 
1) People that get merchants to add Bitcoin, especially bricks &amp; mortar places. Tips aren't an incentive, just a thanks 
2) Tip indie bricks &amp; mortar merchants. Not Dell's &amp; Xbox's but indie stores, just so they keep the option open, even if it brings in minimal sales interest. So when the next surge comes new adopters have got practical places to USE btc...
While I'm at it, I think we should all actively seek out btc places and patronise them. It's too easy not to, and human nature being what it is most people drift off (I'm guilty too) /r

Yes we both agree that ease is important- my point was most wallets now let u specify how much in local currency. (ie the ease is solved consumer-side) So as the difference between say bitpay's rate and that from say breadwallet or greenaddress is marginal, then taking the path of least resistance is likely preferable. Just my tuppence, either way good luck!

You missed a 3rd class of risk to account for - yourself. Forgetfulness, death, user error, etc. Really, this is your biggest risk (both impact and likelihood).

Coincorner are reputable and also consider Xbterminal.io as well.
Tbh though, for in-person high value purchases it's probably easier to sod the no address reuse rule, buy him a Ledger wallet and just print out a QR code in readiness, stick them up in the office, and trust that the person is paying the right GBP amount using their wallet rather than training/re-training/supporting staff for the once-in-long-while btc-using customer.
ps if it's in the south then reply with their URL once they're set up and I'll buy a trip/single-day training next time I'm in the UK.
pps good question too - the bitcoin wiki currently sucks on this point. As an aside I personally think B2B is the key area for in-the-background readiness for the next media/adoption frenzy, simply because it's easier for a biz to sustain meaningfully than B2C adoption at the current time

No, you're only including a headline rate, not the total costs. I get a 2.99% foreign fee on my CC card, but there's also a stack built into the FX spread.
Found [this from back in May]( - bank xfer not CC but illustrates the point:
- 3.8% over the spot fee (CCs can be good here for major currencies, but I have my doubts if you're buying in Thai baht)
- £10 fee (analagous charge to the 2.95% you quote)
While we're on bank transfer foreign remittances, there's more before it even gets to me in Japan:
- ¥3000 intermediate banking fees
- ¥4000 shinsei bank fee for accepting a foreign deposit

I'm not suggesting it was general compromise of mailchimp or anyone else, just answering nullc's concern:


Thinking further about actual source, I'm sure we had a scam mailing about ~6 months to one year ago with the same suspects of LBC and btcjam etc. My guess is on it being the same scammer with the same list: go dormant for a while, spend some time prepping/stealing a new company's identity, clone or impersonate their site, execute a scam using stolen brand, monetise list, rinse &amp;amp; repeat.

This is an excellent summary. 
Yes, back-editing issue can be mitigated by checkpointing at intervals against bitcoin blockchain; it provides some value to banks for reducing 'trustee' functions such as a shared DB IT team or management as well as uniting the political will to actually collaborate on settlement, and may also provide us benefits by testing other aspects a la altcoins.

I'd be happy for SPV wallets to be $0.99 for example. Would it really hurt adoption? My guess is net-no. I think free on-going is just an assumption that it has to be that way.
On a similar vein I've long thought exchange tx fees are unsustainably low - a moderate increase  across the board would be a net gain for the ecosystem imho.

I like ur thinking, it is plausible. But it still doesn't sit right with me. Here's why:
- are tx fees a problem holding back smart contracts? I don't believe so. 
- is this a solution looking for a problem and investors missed that? I don't believe so.
- when smart contracts do start happening, will fast confirmation be important for the majority of contract types? I dont believe so.
A simpler explanation, with a sooner ROI is that they are built-in obsolescence chips. The electricity is free for 21; the investors are chip manufacturers. those incentives makes more sense imho.

@_date: 2015-11-12 13:49:21
Yes, I have read the white paper, but thanks anyway.


It's FUD because SPV is quite safe for bitcoin to replace the majority of use-cases that we use cash for globally.
For very high value or fraud proofs or similar use-cases, then by all means use a full node - explains the balance well:
Also, a 51% attack and vandalizing blockchain history would make everyone lose money, including full clients, so your quote doesn't contribute anything.
If SPV is so dangerous, why weren't these voices up in arms when it was being implemented, or even deployed in brilliant clients such as breadwallet etc? Because SPV does its job. 


Saying it's unsafe is specious and pernicious - intentionally and willfully introducing fear, uncertainty and doubt to try and justify small-blockers' position that we must go slow and keep small blocks for the immediate to medium future. It's not a genuinely-held belief that we can constructively debate, it's just disgusting behaviour.

The solution is that they (the exchange) raise a SAR and then their MLRO is advised to proceed or not, often advised to proceed.
This already happens now with dollars &amp; pounds etc, and the fungibility of those isn't disintegrating.
If the Feds follow up (eg if it were higher value/serious organised crime, but let's keep with ur example), then they ask the exchange for ur info and they ask u where the money came from, which you answer. They then go to the next link in the chain.
If u sold your $2000 bike for ~$2000 all's good with you as well as the fungibility of those coins. If u sold it for ~$10,000 then u probably knew it was hot money and u may get busted for accepting the proceeds of crime, but the fungibility of those coins is still fine - the other side of ur sell order bought the goods (ur btc) at market value for example.
The privacy invasion is a cost from the money launderers shared across all of us, same way CC chargeback fraud is shared amongst all the legit customers. High value stuff like insurance, lawyers, real estate and financial products like FX attract launderers, so they end up with specific KYC regs unlike bike shops, and that I'm afraid affects our privacy when we use those services. Note that I'd also get asked questions about an event if I'm witness to a fatal car crash for example.
Fungibility IS fucking important for btc to succeed, but it's being way overplayed with this Evo / btc-e stuff at the mo.

Because it's total humbug. an article that says 'people usually seek out countries like &lt;insert low-tax jurisdiction&gt; to evade taxes' isn't proof that HE is evading. He left US for his anti-war position, and paid his US 'exit' taxes.
And in exiting and choosing a new location he's not obliged to choose a high-tax jurisdiction just to make you happy, ffs.

Imo the noise over this is not helping, but actually a dis-benefit. However big the resources are with everyone doing bitcoin stuff it's still finite resources. Their time is better spent doing their thing than arguing about this.
Obv we differ in opinion about how much friction the nomenclature causes. With milli, micro SI units already, and 'bits' for micro shorthand, I think we're there already and this noise is just a distraction from fixing other, bigger frictions.

I mainly checked my own balances. The leaked data missed about the last 2 weeks of activity which I thought was suspicious. Other than negative btc balances do you have anything that proves or strongly suggests redacted data / or entire entries removed?

They have iPhone as well. A user can choose instant confirmation with 2FA to prove it's them, and they are charged a small fee. I have no idea about revenue share - paging to answer that one.
But the main thing was to be aware of it - it removes that objection in a black &amp; white way, rather than having to explain heuristics of tx propogation and justify why it's not a big deal etc. I think it's excellent for Bitcoin.

end2end encryption such as PGP/GPG is better but this is a GOOD useability/security compromise. But u MUST disable password reset feature after u sign up - if they can reset it, then it can be subpoenaed.

Actually it's the other way round - moving from here to mainstream is fairly easy to see as plausible, even if u think plausible but very unlikely, or that it will suffer a litany of setbacks and then fail.
However moving from genesis block to Jan 2013 (ie pre-Cyprus fears) IS the different ballgame. Even with hindsight it's hard to fathom just why it held traction when other e-currencies failed - truly amazing that it got where it did.
Jan-Dec 2013 is a easier to see, unless you only think in terms of price.

Everything said here applies. Just a thought but rather than spending effort persuading your partners on merits, just take away the (minor) negatives.
You do all the work set up Bitcoin payment option in your own time (if u can), and you receive/buy the btc . Company gets same money from sales, no chargebacks, and u get btc. If your view is already long on Bitcoin then it's all good. Co has right to revert to  receiving btc directly once the partners see the light. :)

This is true. The thread off this about political definitions misses the point. No-one expected a smooth ride; I expected and still do expect one or more jurisdictions will properly ban it for a time. Control of money is control of power; only last night a btc-unrelated history buff was saying how wars are in essence won on national productivity.
But I think it's already too late for all of them. I have no doubt Bitcoin will get there... but we should expect a bumpy ride however.

VAT on the proportion above 'face value', however HMRC will define that. Eg if zip zap charge 10% margin ie sell 1 btc market value £700 at £770 in the shop, then they (ie you) pay VAT only on the £70 portion = net price of £700 + (£70 * 1.2) = £784.

+1. I think the solution will evolve as plug-ins - too much business risk for a Chinese bitpay company. They'll find a way.

It's different if you say ur spending Bitcoins every time you spend; and ask them to accept natively cos we're both being charged. Accepted this will fall mostly on deaf ears but there will be franchisees that hear those words too.
It maybe also means it's feasible to convert to fiat in smaller but more frequent amounts, this could offset the 2% fee given btc price rise.
Also it's an additional company in the ecosystem, hopefully moving towards paying their supply chain and staff in btc rather than just your exchange. 
Finally, whatever they start with won't be what it finishes with - they're starting with 'payability' and focusing their entire business around that; I'm sure things will evolve quickly.

Hardware purchase analogy isn't right here - think iTunes gift card. £25 face value at £25 means no VAT now but VAT is still paid when the gift card is spent. Sold at £30 means VAT on £5 element when card is sold, and VAT man still gets VAT on the remaining £25 when it's spent. Otherwise you get double taxation as throwawaypoo1 saw.
These rules are a mis-fit for btc but it's what they're using atm.
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:44:24
Yes, good dev - part of on-going maturing of the ecosystem overall. And whilst I agree Bitcoin needs to be more accessible, we're also here because it's at the vanguard of ordinary-user security - pretty obviously in retrospect seeing as it's real money.

They negotiated with regulator a $1.9bn fine rather than go to court. So whilst the burden of proof for the reg's negotiation is less than a court, it is still miles better than most, and 'they laundered $billions of drug cartel money' is not conjecture - we DO know that they did that.

@_date: 2013-12-08 01:36:31
Thanks, I thought from your prior comment there was another newer theft. I don't read the reasons same as u but appreciate the thinking.
My thinking is that sheep market was separated by several days from drop in price. However PBOC is directly correlated - thu eve announce, price drop, fri baidu announcement, price plunge.
Of course correlation isn't cause &amp; effect no one can really say about markets, but that's just my 2mBTC.
Also 'big holders' term is misleading. I think you mean 'smart' investor money perhaps? The early-adopter big holders won't be fazed by PBOC &amp; Baidu news sure, but I think recent big whale investors would be pretty sensitive to that type of news. Again don't know for sure, just sharing my views fwiw.

Why? More 'sensible' than spending what's left on drink or cigarettes. His income is in fiat. If btc were to implode the impact on him is much less than eg an 80yo with all their savings in btc. It's a reasonable asymmetric bet for his circumstances+risk appetite+opinion of btc vs anything else.

Interesting so I dug a tiny bit further - [1-year view]( rather than all time makes it look more clearly like it's on-trend growth and not part of a bubble like April.
An unrelated point is that it also seems unaffected by the SR seizure.  Meaning that SR traffic wasn't as much of the bitcoin economy as people feared. I guess this assumes that a new address per sale means SR transactions wouldn't be in the top 100 addresses though...
@_date: 2013-10-19 23:36:09
Agreed. I was making explicit the inherent assumption was that sr addresses wouldn't have been excluded. Therefore inference drawn from the graph - that SR volume was smaller ratio of volume (ie Bitcoin use) compared to how the media portrayed it - seems valid.
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:10:05
To expand on that, people providing a new good/service (for the sake of argument/clarity only in btc) adds value to the world (assuming it's not just a glitter-ball but useful). That that same denomination of btc subsequently buys less goods/services (or their representation in USD) doesn't mean the original $1 seller has lost out (other than opportunity-cost). It means true value has been added and therefore represented by greater purchasing power. Ergo not a zero-sum game.
True though that simple supply &amp; demand growth (zero-sum element) exists too, but it's not the state of the whole ecosystem (others here have given good examples).
I concur with trying to be sober about ones assessment though - it might be to the moon (I personally think so - it's definitely extremistan), but one can't simply assume that.

That's a super-flimsy argument.
You're stretching a behavior from slapped-wrist domains (eg late submission of accounts, noise abatement, and whatever) onto criminal charges domain. Nothing routine at all.


Whilst there are very occasional miscarriages, guilty means definitely guilty. I don't buy this 'unpredictable' at all. Further, as a reason it misses too - accepting fines is because cost of fighting is greater than fine, but this brings us back to domains in above point. 


Source? Even anecdotal? This is just an assertion on your part. A suspicion of ML means raising a report &amp;amp; then their responsibilities are discharged, ie not guilty. It's a non-trivial task to monitor but it's not some ephemeral thing at all.


Yeah I don't think the CEO /board etc were accused of being complicit. It would be the branch staff that were bought that would face big jail time. But if a branch buys extra big teller windows to receive more cash, and it doesn't get raised in the organization, then something's awry with that org.
Anyway, the point still stands - we do know they were money laundering. Actually, the regulators got slated for doing fine &amp;amp; not taking them to court - their defense was HSBC's loss of US banking licence effectively shuts them down, and they are not the Sinaloa cartel.

Agreed overall but it does make it harder. They've got to capture &amp; filter logging &amp; execute on 2fa code within 30secs rather than send back to C&amp;C for subsequent filtering &amp; execution at their leisure. If it hasn't happened yet I'm sure it will pretty soon.

Yes and no from me too. The plan helps reduce emotions from the execution. You've done your thinking when clear-headed. That's probably more important for some than others, depending on personalities. 
I also agree with the sentiment that a plan can never foresee all eventualities so there does need to be some flexibility - some thinking, by definition under pressure - allowed for; it can't all be concrete!

This deflation argument is bogus, expounded from the-people-whose-model-is-wrong. Commercial borrowing still occurs in free markets during deflation (writing in phone so no link sorry). 
People will only borrow to invest in things that add true value, eg a car to run a biz that earns money, not just a new car to look cool. Overall this will increase true value in the world, instead of 'empty' transactions to just get rid of devaluing holdings.
Also, why do you think lenders wont have a way to cater for deflation in their contracts?
I also think you missed the guys point 'it's never been tried before'. No-one really knows, we're all just making predictions, myself included, but the specious 'deflation is bad' arguments presented as hard facts just bug the shit out of me.

Agree with all, except I 'probably' disagree with your point 4. The Chinese are more inventive and entrepreneurial than most cultures - so the Chinese who 'get it' will still be doing dev and building the future in the same way as other Bitcoiners did prior to recent mainstream love-fest post-SR shutdown &amp; US senate.
