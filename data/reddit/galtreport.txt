It's great to be able to cash out into something that will hold it's value.

Great quote: "the frenzy belies an unhealthy media obsession with identities over ideas"...
This is because the state media wants to glorify or crucify people.  They don't have time or gray matter for anything that requires research or analysis.  Superficial "Infotainment", nothing more.

There is also a greater than zero chance that coffee and soda drinkers will steal from their employer....as well as non-drug taking wallstreet executives and mortage company loan officers...as well as...well you get the point.

Great Idea.  Just sent some BTC for Dorian so he can get some more Sushi!

100% agree.  The more human involvement, the more error prone the system is.

Nice.  Good to read something from someone that gets Bitshares and BitUSD (for the most part).

If this is true:
"TBI says Vessnes and Matonis got their money out through connections with Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, while $473 million swirled down the blockchain drain..."
Then these guys should step down.

Yes, this is true.  A lot of this is from organizations like ISACA and the controls are often based on COBIT.  In fact, Government is looking to private sector for guidance on a lot of these things. 
But I would really like to have some of these strong cryptographic technical protections baked into the protocol so we don't have to rely so heavily on standard IT controls and audits.

Exactly.  They are all friends so they get the velvet rope treatment while the little guy gets the shaft.  Nothing new.  Same ole same ole.
I will say that if true, the closer it was done to the end, the worse it would be in my opinion.  
That would bring to mind that Seinfeld episode with George pushing the women and children out of the way when someone yells "FIRE!!". 
"Smoke?, anyone smell smoke?  FIRE!!!"
That said, if it's not true, the record should be set straight sooner rather than later as these things tend to become "facts" if not disputed promptly.

Thank you very much for this information!

I agree that we need both.  I just wouldn't want to put my trust solely in these traditional controls because I know how they are conducted, by whom and how accurate they are, or more to the point, are not. 
If you can develop blockchain/cryptographic controls that can't be faked, that is a higher level of control IMHO.  The more  human involvement, the error prone these controls and audits are.
**The auditing game is, not surprisingly, easily gamed!!**

Very good use of BitsharesX's BitUSD.

Not sure how old you are and I know it may sound trite but as you get older, it REALLY IS the little things that bring you the most pleasure.

Very good and important points from Andreas on Algorithmic Regulation:
This is consistent with recent trends in the auditing best practices of "Continuous Monitoring" which auditors are familiar with and looking to use.

Very nice review of the volatility problem and some possible solutions.
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:58:22
These are all good general IT controls that exchanges should put in place but I do also think **there are some BitCoin specific technical approaches that people like Andreas are discussing that can go along way to minimizing worse-case scenarios** in the event that all these other good standard IT controls are not in place and working 100% of the time.
That's part of the benefit of a lot of these cryptographic approaches that people are discussing I think.

You said: "Auditors add value because they are highly skilled at identifying the key risks of the business and then identifying key processes and procedures management should have in place to mitigate those risks."
If I'm not mistaken, the auditors of Enron failed to do just that:
Arthur Andersen was charged with and found guilty of obstruction of justice for shredding the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the firm to its audit of Enron...The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs.
Human auditing has it's place but we can and should do BETTER! 
@_date: 2014-03-18 11:32:13
I realize that.  My point is that the value of those controls is limited.  I  know who does these  audits, how they are done and how accurate they are or are not.  I would venture to say that many of the  companies that were responsible for the economic raping of our economy passed these kinds of audits.  
They do not actually provide a  real high level of trust or confidence other than  that the organization is at least smart enough to figure out, **by hook or crook**, how to pass an audit.  The auditing system  is easily gamed....but there is still a place for them i do agree.  **We just should not rely on them to the exclusion of blockchain/crypto controls....**

That's a good idea!  I wonder if they do?  Most foundations would have rules on ethics/conflicts of interest.
Looks like they do: 
Happy Reading!

Indeed.  Seems they back up the reporters quotes (from the article above):
—- FULL STATEMENT from Temple Sheriff’s Station of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department —-
Suspicious Person Call in Temple City on Feb. 20, 2014
At 2:09PM, on Thursday, Feb. 20, 2014, Temple Sheriff’s Station of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department received a suspicious person call in Temple City. The caller reported an unknown woman in her 20’s was knocking on the door at his home, and sitting on his porch for the past hour. The caller said he was afraid to open the door.
Two deputies responded and spoke to the male resident caller and the woman. The woman identified herself as Newsweek reporter Leah Goodman and the resident expressed reluctance to talk to her. The deputies were present for the brief conversation between the two, and then the resident went back inside his home and the reporter left.
“I spoke to the two Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputies who handled the call and who were present for the conversation,” said Captain Mike Parker, Sheriff’s Headquarters Bureau, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. **“Both sheriff’s deputies agreed that the quotes published in the March 6, 2014, Newsweek magazine Bitcoin article that were attributed to the resident and to one of the deputies were accurate.”**
