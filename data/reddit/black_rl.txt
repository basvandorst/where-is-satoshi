Not necessarily half, but a little more balance won’t do you no harm.
Things can work out, problem is things can fail too.

The Big Bang Theory is great, but not more than major country radio (at least here!).
Funny thing is that when we get to mainstream I suspect what we are going to hear the most is “it’s too expensive! Now it’s too late for me, I wish I got in early”.
Anyway, the reports of Bitcoin death are greatly exaggerated.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:48:11
So true.
But it’s not a rational thing, it’s a psychological thing.
“I want one Bitcoin”
Do not underestimate the power of this.
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:10:37
You will always need third parties, can be an exchange, a wallet, a safe, etc.
Banks may disappear (I don’t believe in this, they can start supporting cryptocurrencies and become even more relevant), but you are going to need other services, even if you don’t want any of them, a service that safe-keeps your cryptocurrencies is always needed.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:30:58
I don’t trust “strange” exchanges.

Fortunately no one, I had the choice to use Coinbase, but not all countries have safe options for buying Bitcoin.
It’s not about choice, I can choose to make a deal with someone and that someone can scam me, I didn’t choose the latter.

@_date: 2017-12-03 11:30:49

But yeah, might be that.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:13:39

Reason is what I said, just look at SegWit adoption.
How can it be a game changer if it’s not implemented?
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:21:10
Because after the big money is  in, there’s no more big money to get in.
So huge swings in the price can’t be easily done, they can happen, but it should be more stable, just like stocks.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:58:50
You might be right, but I believe you’re wrong.
Countries, funds, miners, merchants, people, Bitcoin has a ton of money invested in it, it’s becoming too big to fail.
But then again, I might be wrong and you right.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:22:37
I see, excellent explanation. Not sure there’s an easy answer, because in reality you increased your wealth by trading, therefore it’s taxable.
Maybe they can make better laws in the future, one can hope.

Bitcoin is a bubble, and it’s ok, it works, it’s just like retirement plans, they are a bubble based on the birth of new humans, and they somewhat work.
Bitcoin is based on new humans getting in, since it has a 21 million limit and we already have close to 8 billion humans and growing, the bubble might never burst.
FOMO on huge gains keeps the bubble going, FUD might drop the price from time to time, but for now FOMO&gt;FUD. Imo the limit amount of available coins vs number of humans will keep this relation like this.
We just need governments to tax us and let us be, no more bans like China.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:02:38
I can’t be FUD because I’ve bought at low price.

Diversification is a part of financial investment, to be fair of all types of investment, no matter the timeline.
Diversification serves the purpose of reducing risk and uncertainty. You do not know what is going to fail or succeed, so you diversify.

The final opportunity to get in while it’s cheap is now.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:40:23
Also banks, the sooner they get their part of the pie the better.
We need strong lobbies.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:42:17
I believe this growth can be sustained, the big boys are coming.
You can’t say Bitcoin is bound to hit 1.000.000$ until 2020 and then not believe in this kind of growth, one can not exist without the other.
Soon only the rich will be able to have a full Bitcoin.

People paying for high fees is a sign of value, not the opposite.
It’s not desirable to have them, but don’t be fooled thinking adoption will slow down because of it, Bitcoin value is elsewhere, at least for now.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:05:21
Governments just need to regulate exchanges....... done.
What’s the problem with some Bitcoiners and regulation anyways? Good regulation is good.
Oh, I know, said Bitcoiners only care about regulation when they loose something, want to attack Ver, want to attack another coin, want to defend their rights, etc.
When any of that happens is lawsuits, regulations, laws and police everywhere.
Yeah, right.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:26:16
If the goal is 100k or 1000k, dips to 5k (or whatever value) don’t really matter.

It’s not that simple. Let’s see some dumb shit:
- You spend money on a good restaurant, you enjoy the meal
- You spend money on a Xbox, you enjoy playing
- You spend money on a live concert, you enjoy the music
Problem with Bitcoin is that you might loose all the money and contrary to what you say, you might not enjoy that at all, it might be highly stressful and damaging to your health.
I say you only should invest what you are 100% sure you can loose.

Nice read, let me just add some food to ease your mind.
First I want to say that although people are always afraid of the new great thing, they seem to forget that it can be Bitcoin, Bitcoin is not a finished product and it will never be, it evolves over time.
So if other alts copy features from Bitcoin, Bitcoin can do the same.
Second, about mining, huge capital is investing in this, do you think they won’t do everything they can to make it a success? Lobbies, money, laws, news, marketing, I mean everything?
Just don’t invest what you can’t loose, relax and enjoy the ride.

No, Bitcoin will thrive when:

- When it’s safe and easy to store, the current method is too risky and complicated
Bitcoin needs KISS treatment.

Sure, I’m not saying they won’t come, I’m saying we’re far way from it.

I normally think “inside” the coin too, so for example Litecoin, it might hit, let’s say 50k, and my mind goes like “what percentage of that I want to have?”, then I bought a couple of them.
It’s funny, I look at coin like 0 to 100%, it’s easier to explain to my wife and stuff, it’s like, “you don’t have to do complicated math, if it hits X value you have Y percentage of it, simple as that”.
I know this isn’t the financial way of doing things, but you know what? A huge part of this digital coin ordeal is psychological.

Why do people need to cash out from Bitcoin? As in get fiat in order to be rich?
Like it or not fiat is *the* currency, used worldwide, is what people know, it's accepted everywhere, it has proven its value, over and over again.
Bitcoin? Highly unstable, still an experience, extremely complex and newcomer unfriendly.
If Bitcoin gets to the same point as fiat, it will no longer be a high risk high reward asset, a massively used currency can't be as unstable as Bitcoin.
Don't believe me? Imagine you have a store, now price your stuff in Bitcoin, in the morning you earn money in the afternoon you loose, this can't happen in a stable economy.
So really, are you surprised?

@_date: 2017-08-23 13:22:21
You can't ignore the fact that things have changed, Bitcoin has way more users and consequently way more transactions. This made everything slower and caused the imminent fix and all hard forks, devs are trying to adjust the code to support more transactions.
People are treating Bitcoin as gold, an asset, and not as a currency. You should be happy that happened because if you have some that you bought early you now have a fortune.
Now Bitcoin (all forks) is trying to reach the masses, and for that it needs to be quick again, will that make the value go up or down? No one knows.

They can ban it in the US, then traders won't accept it and you will have a very hard time to:
- buy it
- buy stuff
- cash out
So yeah, like I've said many times, keep an eye open for the impeding US bill.
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:41:58

Yes, money != connecting to internet.
You think people are gonna just randomly put money in a piece of paper without knowing what can, and will happen to their hard earned money?
If your friend doesn't understand what can happen to his Bitcoin he should be warned, you know, by his friend.
Also, accepting Bitcoin != storing all your money in Bitcoin, ask your friend how he stores his money.
Mass adoption is nowhere near with how Bitcoin works now.

It's free cash for the ones holding Bitcoin before the fork.

@_date: 2017-08-19 20:54:42
More like the old gold, people don't want to pay with it, people want to get rich with its future valuation.
Funny thing is that although people believe in it, they all want to cash out at some point in the future for fiat currencies.
That doesn't say that people don't believe in Bitcoin, they just don't believe in it as a mass payment system.
It's a high risk high reward asset, handle with care!

Agreed, but no mortgage is better than mortgage, I know it’s easier to say than do but that doesn’t make it wrong, just makes it difficult to achieve.
The problem with all debt, as my life as shown me, is the variables you don’t control, governments, world economics, war, changing habits, natural disaster, non natural disaster, new laws, you name it.
Suddenly you might be in a position where you can’t pay your debts, and believe me, you’re going down fast, count your friends before and after, you’re going to be surprised.

I've been warning this sub about this, don't ignore the government, make wise decisions.

I don’t agree, no debt is the only way to go for me, sorry.

Good advice on the holding.
You know why the payments she receives is so low? Because it's not popular like I said.
That's why, although I highly appreciate you being polite in the internet and respect your arguments, they still don't impact the casual user.
Casual user, the masses, doesn't understand Bitcoin, even worst, he is afraid of loosing money if he uses it.
The current complexity of Bitcoin is not helping, at all, we all (and it seems you are doing your part), need to fight this, we need Bitcoin to be easy and trustful, or else it will never reach its full potential.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:25:23
Right, but make no mistake, the day will come that people want to cash out, when that day comes its not going to be something good to watch.

But you do what works best for you, I was asked for advice/opinion and that’s what I did.
Note that I’m not discussing the mathematics/economics behind it, I’m not saying your reasoning or calculations are wrong.
It’s too risky to have debt, that’s what I’m saying, when things go awry shit hits the fan really quick and messy.

He says that but investes everything before in order to get free coins, why do you think bitcoin is so high now?
@_date: 2019-02-11 13:08:38
The problem is the fear of 0 value, if Bitcoin had a secured minimum value that wouldn’t happen.
When it’s too low, and good to buy, people are afraid that it’s going to reach 0.
@_date: 2019-02-01 14:47:08
Recently I got a blackmail email asking for bitcoin that provided a bitcoin wallet, I was somewhat brought to the real world when I acknowledge that nothing can be done with that, it’s a little bit shocking.

Since Bitcoin is rising at least until 10.000$, hopefully 1.000.000$, you should buy every time you have the chance.
I was waiting too, you know what happened? Only bought a little at 3.800$ because I was like “with the hard fork and all, certainly it’s going to go lower?”.
Now it’s at +7.000$......

I don’t believe in always, not for good or Bitcoin, imagine that we mine some asteroid or whatever filled with gold, suddenly gold is not valuable anymore (again, not saying the same can’t happen to bitcoin!).
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:07:34
No, and did you check the top posts? It’s all memes.
And it’s not about size but about money, one single individual with a fortune can influence the market more than all of us.

I’m guessing if that happens bullets, water or food will be worth more.
And it’s not like you have the gold in your house, if the world as we know it collapses I’m pretty sure both are useless.

When you over throw the government, who is responsible? And what should we call them?

Wait, that sounds just like a government.

-evaluate what you can loose, 10% is a good rule
-get bitcoin, Coinbase is a very popular and easy to use exchange
-get a cold wallet like TREZOR, move your bitcoin to it
-safely store your wallet and passwords, carefully choose the places or people you trust
-hold until it reaches your goal
-sell and enjoy life, or if bitcoin is accepted as payment in the places you want, spend it directly from your wallet
Good luck and welcome!

Note that I’m all for Bitcoin and what it brings to the table.
I’m just advocating what it needs if it truly wants to be an alternative to current standards.
My only personal concerns are:
- Safety
- What happens if something goes wrong, according to the stories I read you lose everything, it’s just too risky
Other than that I think it’s a great tech.

It’s only dumb if you put everything you have on crypto.
@_date: 2019-04-12 09:35:48
But I and many others don’t want that responsibility, we want a third party to take care of things.
The perfect scenario is having both, you choose how you want to do things.
Just like a car, TV, clothes, house and so many things, most times you don’t mind paying a fee so others have the responsibility.
Money is the same to me, I don’t want to have all the responsibility considering safety and transactions.
Hope this helps you understand, it’s not a old people thing, it’s about convenience and the time and effort you’re willing to put in something.
@_date: 2019-04-23 12:45:45
Well..... it’s also a lot easier to steal so.....
@_date: 2019-04-11 13:15:48
People hate Coinbase but this is the kind of thing we need to hit mainstream, they’re also very user friendly.
@_date: 2019-04-12 10:41:27
Exactly, for some people it’s just too risky, like I said, it’s not about being old.
It’s just like chargeback and stuff like that, I prefer to use PayPal, although they charge fees, because I feel a lot, and I mean a fuck ton safer than just using Bitcoin.
The fight should not be about imposing something to people, we’re all different, the fight should be about solving people issues and trust, providing strong simple solutions.
Coinbase is doing part of this.
@_date: 2019-04-05 12:54:38
That’s actually one of the problems of Bitcoin, needs to be simpler and safer.

The contrary is more likely to happen.
IMO Bitcoin should work more like a Trojan horse, an alternative, work with it and not against it.
Not only it’s suicidal but it’s also completely delusional to go headstrong against such forces.

Anyway, here are some reasons:
- there’s a lot of important stuff to pay if you’re not living in your parents house
- 4K is not trivial to most humans
- your partner might not agree
- you might want to enjoy life now instead of waiting for it
- you shouldn’t invest all your savings in such a risky thing
- some events that you not control, such as hard forks, war, natural disasters or governments may lock you out of it
- etc
There are a ton of things against and only one in favor:
- it might reach the moon
Or not.

- Coinbase is somewhat hated vs Coinbase being one of the most, if not the most popular exchange
- Huge drops in price when everybody is shouting hodl

I check this sub everyday, but I think it has too much memes and too little good posts imo, fortunately the comments have lots of good info.

Create a Bitcoin address in coinbase &gt; receive funds &gt; send them to your wallet &gt; repeat.
@_date: 2017-09-20 08:50:13
Totally agreed about the first mover advantage!
Regarding the challenges, yes..... unfortunately we have a long way to walk.....
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:37:00
What about the memes?
@_date: 2018-03-17 11:47:39
Yes, it’s alive as long as you pay the energy bills.
@_date: 2017-09-24 10:06:14
Well..... beats smoking!
....... hope your parents are wrong.
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:23:42
It's 100% unrealistic because you can't convince everyone to work in the same idea, hell you can't convince all Bitcoin people to agree (as seen in the last and the upcoming hard fork)!
People will be people.

I can’t really reply because I don’t follow other crypto, I’m guessing nowhere because it crashed?
But I bet a lot of people did a lot of money before crashing.
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:09:33
Isso é muito interessante.
Mas não achas que podes ser enganado? Ou só fazes a transação á frente da pessoa? Troca no "local"?

Because if you want to buy it again it costs you more offsetting your earnings.
- buy at 4200
- sell at 4300
- profit of 100
- buy at 4500
- sell at 4900
- profit of 400
Total profit 500
- buy at 4200
- sell at 4900
- profit of 700
See the difference? Huge dips are the only way constant trading, known as daily trading compensates:
- buy at 4200
- sell at 4300
- profit of 100
- buy at 2000
- sell at 4900
- profit of 2900
Total profit 3000
- buy at 4200
- sell at 4900
- profit of 700
See? But for normal folks it's too risky, so we hodl.
@_date: 2017-09-25 17:41:55
I didn’t read, there’s no point, like I said, we’re not getting anywhere.
I hope someday you change your views, life is filled with things we can’t control.
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:33:43
Dump! Dump!
I need to buy some more.
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:30:07
Pois, mas se calhar o premium &lt; mais valias.
Aqui entre nós acho que o preço atual está a ser manipulado, primeiro porque está em subida á muito tempo, já devia ter tido um ajuste.
Segundo porque as notícias mais recentes como o ban da China a ICOs deviam ter feito cair o preço.
Terceiro por causa do hard fork de Novembro.....
Algo fishy se passa amigo.
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:23:12
Just wait for PayPal, they have a deal with Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:42:51
I know Bitcoin is supposed to hit 21 millions, but imagine what can happen if people keep losing them..... would Bitcoin still work?
Interesting thought.
@_date: 2017-09-09 10:53:24
Tell them about games and other digital stuff, tell them that people pay a fuck ton of cash for "nothing", it's all 0's and 1's.
Value is what people are whiling to pay for something, and it's very obvious that people are whiling to pay for Bitcoin.
Or you could just pull a simple graph of Bitcoin in the last years, yeah, that should work.
@_date: 2017-09-17 10:38:46
What if they bought at 1000$ or 100$?
They should be thanking you?
@_date: 2017-09-10 09:06:54
The sooner the better so we can start our trip to the moon.
China likes to ban things, this is no surprise.
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:10:04
I missed that train, but I'm not gonna miss the SegWit2x one!
All aboard! Free coins!
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:07:57
This is selfish of me but I'm waiting for the dip, it's going to be a huge, maybe one of the last, opportunity to get cheap Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-09-24 13:12:00
Exactly, that’s what I said, we all pay to help each other.
@_date: 2017-09-24 10:21:57
Only until we reach the moon!
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:07:07
Hope so, to be honest I’m hopping it’s Gold 100.0
@_date: 2017-09-23 14:09:06
I care because I need one last buy before I hold until 1.000.000 USD.
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:27:43
I was ID verified in real time, not sure if luck but that's what happened.
I won't risk, it's directly to hardware wallet.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:23:01
It really can’t..... that’s for sure.
@_date: 2017-09-25 08:09:29
So if someone outplays you, kills you and takes your place and everything you have you shouldn’t really mind, because natural selection.
We have fundamental different views of life, I’m glad most humans see things the way I do, we’re not in a jungle.
Humans are trying to be a superior species, we’re more than just natural selection, we are ethics, morals, intelligence, love, compassion, ingenuity amongst so many other things.
Btw, a person with a disability can in many cases have perfectly healthy children. Ideally we want healthy bodies, but don’t forget about healthy minds.
One of the greatest human minds alive today is Stephen Hawking, he did more for mankind than you and me, probably more than most of reddit, and you know the shocker? He has a severe disability, according to you he should have been killed when he was born or something, think about this..... maybe you should be the one to die? What did you do for mankind?
Good luck anyways, don’t forget to kill yourself when you get old, have an injury or get sick.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:05:14
Captain Obvious, the champion of the people.
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:41:24
And who should pay then? For the ones that can’t pay for themselves?
I’m not putting words in your mouth, you’re the one saying they should be abandoned to their luck, that includes the possibility of death, by cancer, other illness, disability, bad luck or whatever.
You’re not a burden for now, and you’re saying that about yourself, others might have a different opinion.
Some extremists could consider you a burden, be it for your ideals, for your looks or whatever, then what? Natural selection and fuck you?
Anyway, we won’t get anywhere with this, that much is obvious.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:15:11
Directly from [Trezor]( and it went like this:
- wednesday 30 of August I ordered it
- received it (I'm in Europe) today the 4 of September by DHL!
@_date: 2018-03-19 13:16:21
We need better tools, better ways to safely store and make payments.
And when I say better, I say 200% noob friendly.
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:55:54
I like all this memes, but it's becoming increasingly obvious that we have no influence whatsoever in the price.
Some big money is making it move, and they are making some serious cash.
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:21:31
What about banning it? Lol
Much wise.
@_date: 2017-09-08 12:36:11
Plot twist, he has Bitcoin, more than all of us together.
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:06:39
It's not that simple, and for example, is there just one definitive tv? Phone? Car? Why would you believe there only will exist a definitive currency or crypto?
Not going to happen, and it's not all about tech, sometimes someone pride is all it takes to have a different proposition.
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:28:38
That seems more realistic to me, we all hope you're somewhat right.
@_date: 2017-09-21 07:42:45
Why didn’t you just say that a wallet equals to a bank account, and sending Bitcoin from wallet to wallet it’s just like transferring money from one bank account to another?
This happens everyday all the time.
I believe I’m one of the most skeptics in this sub regarding mass adoption, just see my comments, I also want to believe in you, I seriously do.
But you both failing to understand, or explain, the one thing that works just like fiat is, let’s say, surprising me.
The real challenge is keeping Bitcoin safe, I don’t know if mainstream adoption can happen because of this huge problem.
You had a Bitcoin problem, you lost some or were robbed or something, there’s no headquarters of Bitcoin where you can go, there’s no central bank that will help you, you’re alone, no one is gonna help you.
I’m pretty sure a ton of people won’t accept this.
We need new “banks” that safe keep Bitcoin, kinda like the normal banks but for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-06 13:15:49
I expect a correction in the near future because:
- the dip didn't really occur, we're still in the bull run
- government regulations
- hard fork SegWit2x
Then the price will stay low for some time while all this mess is sorted out.
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:54:30
I already have one, now what?
@_date: 2017-09-07 08:53:06
Yes they do, and it's a crime. Just like I said, it's only useful for crime if governments ban it. Not talking about science, morals or possible benefits, strictly talking about law. If you do drugs (or other banned stuff) in a country where they're banned you're committing a crime.
Is that what we want for Bitcoin? Is that our goal? To be useless for government and useful for criminals?
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:36:49
And that's exactly how I see the future, several alternatives competing.
The huge difference, I hope, is that crypto will be taken very seriously too.
@_date: 2017-09-10 09:27:01
Turning away from Trezor? I just bought one! Why? Open source and the dev team seems to be great!
Nano also seems like an excellent choice, but I prefer full open source.
@_date: 2017-09-24 13:33:29
It’s not that simple.
You born in a country, you have to abide to their laws or change country (except if you born in a dictatorship, in that case you are fucked).
In democratic countries you also have the option to form your own party and try to change laws.
If you think taxes are theft, you need to change country or run for the government and change things.
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:24:29
Coinbase will decide the victor.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:02:26
Nop, SegWit2x hard fork is gonna tank the price hard.
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:37:48
Here, but that doesn't change the fact that now is going down.
I think that with the hard fork it might go under 2k, let's see.
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:23:25
That's extreme but I get your point.
Let me try to convey mine better, if you can't use Bitcoin to pay day to day bills in your country, if you can't cash out, why would you want it? And even if you still wanted it, do you honestly believe the mainstream people would want it?
I much prefer solutions like Japan, I much prefer governments to accept Bitcoin, imo that should be our main goal, be understood and accept by governments so mainstream adoption could really start!
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:51:53
You need to correct the top blocks :)

@_date: 2017-09-24 23:55:37
Who payed them? Curious!
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:19:27
Yes, they can cash out and the price would drop like a rock.
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:15:19
I am! Ahahaha
@_date: 2017-09-06 13:00:04
It won't reach the masses, ever.
Cash out will be extremely difficult and probably ilegal, in short, we don't want that to happen.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:22:02
Fair enough, but it was so painfully obvious that I’m sad.
@_date: 2017-09-09 10:49:34
My two cents is that the largest exchange of the world, Coinbase, manages the 3, in fact it only has the 3.
So knee jerk decisions are the same for the 3 for a lot of people.
@_date: 2017-09-05 09:38:29
True that, let's hope it's fast enough.
@_date: 2017-10-09 11:30:30
Imo you shouldn’t try to convince people, what if something goes wrong? You want that responsibility on you?
I only educate people that talk about it first, that ask about it, not the other way around.
@_date: 2017-09-23 09:37:39
China is like that awkward dude that stares at the party but never enters.
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:32:28
Agreed, I've read and write about it.
It's just that I'm only a couple of days from getting my Trezor, I'm excited!
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:39:40
True! xD
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:26:33
Right, but depends from country to country.
Why is the tax different when holding or not over there? Don't they just tax the profits? And what defines holding? Even if I'm a trader I can say I was holding?
I appreciate if you can explain how that tax works.
@_date: 2017-09-08 12:39:23
Why don't you use Coinbase? You can use temporary debit card?
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:07:16
This is true, in my country they are banning payments in cash if the value is superior to 3000€!
@_date: 2017-09-08 12:22:16
Sorry..... what? I was checking the price and didn't pay attention.
Just kidding :)
@_date: 2017-09-22 09:41:41
No, you should hodl a little more.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:06:25
Good advice, do you know if I can recover without sending any funds? Or this doesn't make any sense? Thanks.
@_date: 2017-09-17 10:08:55
I think China + SegWit2x will drop the price to below 2k.
We had a dead cat bounce at 3k because of buy orders, we should have 2 more similar bounces, at 2.5k and 2k.
But the price is gonna drop hard.
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:59:17
Good advice, thanks.
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:15:07
That's why you need to get out of the sound chamber and visit r/buttcoin
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:46:41
I know miners probably understand code, marketing not so much, only a fool would abandon the strongest name of the crypto market, Bitcoin, BTC.
This is the only option available, good on them.
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:15:48
The core difference is who controls it, governments control their money, Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:02:14
I’m in Europe, I buy using Coinbase, everything is in euros.
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:14:26
Thanks for tip but I'm not sure I know what are you talking about (I'm on mobile).

Is this it? Will it work?
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:15:25
O choose this because:
- I want to store more than one crypto in the same place
- It's better to make transactions
That's it, but paper wallets sound great too.
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:06:58
It's 100% unrealistic.
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:20:17
That's why I said trading is not for the majority of us, trading is for the wolves. Good trading can dramatically make you even more rich, if you have the cash to do it.
I'm just a poor man, I hodl.
@_date: 2017-09-03 12:51:55
Indeed it is!
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:42:59
Or you can go to the police, but not in your ideal country because there’s none.
Taxes are needed to pay public services such as the police.
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:03:05
Yeah, it seems the box is the same, first I assumed an error from Trezor but they change the sticker in the back, mine says white.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:15:49
That I do not know.
@_date: 2017-09-17 10:30:20
We all know?
We all know about the impending hard fork, the drop is not over.
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:57:29
For example, yes.

This, so much this!
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:41:17
Just try to keep them safe, now that’s hard!
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:44:03
It can't buy it but it sure helps! Ehehehehe
But true!
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:11:48
Don't know, Bitcoin might be dead, who knows?
But I'm 100% confident it will drop in the hard fork, just like last time.
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:20:48

My neighbor can't recycle or correctly use a smartphone, no way in hell is gonna know how to buy or safe keep digital currencies.
Talk to people in real life, you will see how far we are from mainstream.
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:59:03
Seen: governments bans
Heard: hard forks, creating billions out of code
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:36:25
I won’t do that, what if it goes to shit? I don’t want that responsibility.
Imo the fastest way is joining the big boys, PayPal, Amazon, etc.
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:03:40
Indeed, it’s better.
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:59:13
Are you saying water is dry? Ehehehehe
Anyway, the bias in this sub is pretty obvious (not saying who is right, just pointing out where this sub is).
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:05:06
I’m not a supporter of any of the forks btw, tbh I’m just here for the moon, nothing else, I don’t really care if it’s S2X or core, I just want to get there.
I’m just trying not to get screwed, that’s why I said keep your coins safe.
Why I think S2X will be the next Bitcoin? Just using logic, seems obvious to me that S2X has massive exchanges + miners support, I don’t think a bunch o yelling Reddit nerds can beat that.
But we will know soon enough, with a bit of luck I’m gonna double my coins!

@_date: 2017-10-23 13:22:11
I don’t believe big money will enter while the best way to store the value is a 100$ hardware wallet......
Bitcoin needs a new secure way to store value.

You shouldn't recommend high risk investments to anyone, let them do their research.
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:06:18
My tip, 1/4 for BTC, 3/4 normal savings.
Hope we all get lucky in the future.
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:01:31
I use Trezor, why? Because it’s open source.
@_date: 2017-09-24 17:19:06
Fair enough.
Let me just add that in a democracy we can vote to change things.
Regarding health, problem is that poor persons you talk about, you can find yourself in that position, be it your own fault or not, and you shouldn’t die with cancer because you are poor.
I fuckin HATE countries that let that happen, someone dies a horrible death because they are poor, as a species you can’t really go lower than that.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:45:13

Here is my feedback:
- 1, ok
- 2, separate the word in a easier way to read, de/cen/tra/lize
- 3, try just “running full mode”
- 4, remove the mask from the coin with hands up
- 5, try just “hodl”
- 6, try “to the moon” without enter
Final suggestion, you need to do the rollercoaster coin alone, for me it’s the most important one.
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:44:20

@_date: 2017-09-21 11:34:48
That doesn’t really matter if your goal is to explain Bitcoin in a simple manner, moreover the fiat system isn’t as simple as some people make it seem, it’s a very complex ecosystem.
Mainstream doesn’t understand how money works, they just need to know the basics, the same should be applied to Bitcoin if you want mass adoption.
Like I said, the problem is keeping Bitcoin safe, because for fiat you just go to the bank and you’re done, not the same for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:25:11
It sure isn't, that is the most serious threat, but there's more:
- increased mining difficulty making it only viable for huge miners, as in centralization
- hard forks, hard forks everywhere
- problems in the network caused by war or other serious world incident

Unfortunately they are not, they vote for it, and more often than not the least popular party wins, as in Trump.
Also, a government doesn't need a majority of people, right now in my country the government is formed by a coalition that lost the elections but still formed government.
Finally, if you're counting for the masses to adopt blockchains while governments are against it, you're in for a big surprise.

Agreed, maybe I'm not explaining myself right.
If the use of Bitcoin is banned and deemed ilegal in a country, if afterwards you use it you're committing a crime.
For example ICOs are now ilegal in China, it's a crime and can be punished by death! Fuck that!

Good point, but it’s not always like that.

To complete your post, I think one of the strongest arguments against S2X is that core devs don’t support it.
Some say core devs may abandon Bitcoin if S2X succeeds.
If this is true I don’t understand why they didn’t do anything to prevent mining centralization, maybe create a quota system or something.

Don’t you know? Everything makes Bitcoin stronger.
@_date: 2017-10-14 11:06:31
You have to fix the prices in USD then accept the value in Bitcoin, don’t use Bitcoin for the prices because it’s too volatile.
Basically you say your price is 1.500$ but you accept payment in Bitcoin, when that happens it can be 0.2 Bitcoin, 0.1 or 0.3, that’s why you price in USD.
Go to Coinbase and create an account, link your bank so you can convert from Bitcoin to Fiat and vice-versa, you can generate addresses to receive Bitcoin.
If you’re planning to hold Bitcoin for a long period don’t store them at Coinbase, get a hardware wallet like Trezor and transfer your Bitcoin from Coinbase to Trezor.
@_date: 2017-09-01 08:44:04

Depends on the country, how you cash out etc.

Profit 1: 3000
Buy: 2500
Sell: 7000
Profit 2: 4500
Buy: 6000
Sell: 10000
Profit 3: 4000
Profits: 3000 + 4500 + 4000 = 11500
11500 &gt; 8000

You can change government, you can change laws, but you can't avoid them.

The reason is people, people see Gold as a way to store value, latter they can trade it for money.
The values you keep talking about are money, not Gold, you’re talking about the trade value of Gold.
Oranges are also traded for money, different values but still money.

Ah ok! I see.
It’s 0% sophisticated, fiat is very, very, very complex, in fact it’s more complex than Bitcoin, not the production per se but everything that entails it.
I don’t think you, or we, need to worry about that, you don’t need to understand programming in order to enjoy a game, or understand directing in order to enjoy a movie, or know how to make paper in order to enjoy a book.
With Bitcoin is going to be the same, the masses will (hopefully!) enjoy it without truly knowing how it works, just like fiat.
I know that I’m going to sound like a broken record, but I have to stress the fact that what I’m having a hard time to explain to people is how to make keep it safe, again, it should be Bitcoin focus, help people keep it safe.

I’m rich!!!!!!!!!!!!
......... not yet. Soon.
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:18:21
Exacto, bem visto. Tb dá para comprar?
@_date: 2017-09-24 17:29:39
See it like this, instead of spending [billions in the military]( they could use a small fraction of that in health care and still maintain innovation.
But I’m guessing here, I’m not from the US, I’m just talking based on what I read.
I don’t think people need to die horribly because of electric cars, and as a species we can wait, all this rushing is part of the problem and not part of the solution.
Higher morals and education can go a long way.
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:40:31
Use your ID, that's what I did.
@_date: 2017-09-07 10:21:31
The only difficulty I can see is getting the first coins, after that should be easy to use them underground. Maybe underground is the place to get them in the first place if such events occur? Ah!
@_date: 2019-09-19 12:48:46
But hard forking Bitcoin is ok?
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:00:50
Different things, I can convert gold to money.
It’s like saying a house is money, it’s not until you convert it to money, calling every asset money is the dumb thing.
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:43:57
I’m not having and argument, so there’s that friend.
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:27:25
People buy and sell both gold and oranges with money.
Both are worth money, different values but both are worth money.
Not creating new ideas, just stating facts, if you want gold or oranges to be money, first you have to trade them for money.
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:46:50
When you start paying your daily bills with gold instead of money I might consider changing my view.
Until then we have different views, and that’s ok friend.
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:37:39
No friend, is how to consider Bitcoin money.
Fortunately I live in a democracy, so in my country, at least to an extent, government = people.
And so far, we’re pretty friendly towards Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:14:56
Who said I can’t? My country as no issues with Bitcoin.
But for certain payments I have to use other forms of payment, that’s all.
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:41:17
I use Bitcoin Ticker.
@_date: 2017-10-04 12:51:34
Xbox X!
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:10:00
Free coins for me then.
@_date: 2018-07-24 13:07:58
Two, Litecoin is great.
@_date: 2018-04-03 23:21:43
Only nerds understand what you’re saying, believe me, the future is not here.
We need simplification of things.
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:18:24
What if it’s just thin air?
The worth of things is measured by what people are willing to pay, Bitcoin is the same.
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:58:48
I guess you’re a trader then :)
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:06:21
I see.
Not my case, as a matter of fact elections in my country will happen soon.
But I have to pay bills and taxes, and for that I use accepted money/ways of payment.
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:40:55
More like me waiting for the 1.000.000$ price.
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:30:19
Keep running! KEEP RUNNING! DON’T TURN BACK!
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:43:19
It is, that’s not how you keep risk low.
But it’s HIS call, so good luck again.
@_date: 2018-04-26 13:04:33
I guess the Bitcoin name/brand should’ve been trademark by the core team a long time ago, now it’s too late.
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:00:45
[More like this! xD]( 
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:56:32
Same feelings friend.
@_date: 2018-04-11 12:47:49
You’re looking the wrong way, look up!
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:43:06
There’s no point in us arguing more, we’re going in circles.
Our ideas are clear, and they have some differences, no need to keep saying the same stuff with different words.
Peace friend.
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:46:55
The value of a given thing is the value another human being is willing to pay/trade for it.
Bitcoin is no different.
If no human wants to pay/trade it, it has no value, the non human universe around us is an example of this, the universe/nature doesn’t care, it just is.
@_date: 2019-09-18 09:05:21
Just like a Bitcoin fork.
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:57:30
Unfortunately (fortunately?) I remember, I was one of the nerds! I was the first one with internet in my village!
Let’s hope Bitcoin simplification is faster!
@_date: 2018-04-15 11:51:37
Why didn’t you get it from the official site?
@_date: 2018-04-20 12:21:05
It’s not like they can explain other big things..... so it’s all good.
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:00:02
That’s why I hold both.
Diversify to keep risk low friends, that’s the name of the game.
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:57:13
I think you have a nice portfolio! ;)
@_date: 2018-04-22 16:23:59
That’s what I’m saying, is risking too much imo.
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:49:29
Would be funny to watch if this guys become richer than Zuckerberg.
@_date: 2018-04-04 08:59:32
The problem is not “we”, the average joe needs it to be as simple or simpler than what he currently uses.
And condescending people will only make them avoid it even further.
If Bitcoin wants to be serious about mainstream it needs to KISS all the way.
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:17:49
Bitcoin take notes please!
@_date: 2017-10-17 07:50:54
Nobody knows but my wife, so nobody is criticizing.
@_date: 2018-04-03 09:13:18
For example you can walk down the street more safely, therefore you are avoiding being robbed or going to the hospital.
The return equals to what you save, a true long period investment.
@_date: 2018-04-22 10:20:59
Diversify so you keep risk low, this is a very bad call imo.
Good luck anyway!
@_date: 2018-04-04 09:08:07
I don’t know.
Question is, does it do everything automatically for the user?
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:28:10
Like it’s any easier with younger people ;)
@_date: 2018-12-24 20:37:13
Bitcoin has 2 major flaws:
- Still complicated
- No way to safely store it (my FIAT is in the bank and has insurance)
While this 2 problems remain unsolved you aren’t going to convince a ton of people, older or not.
@_date: 2018-12-06 16:21:27
Yes, I would like Bitcoin to hit the values previewed in 2017 for 2018.
That would be great.
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:02:04
The image is on point with the current situation.
@_date: 2018-12-24 20:39:17
You don’t need to hack it, you just need to hack someone computer/phone/whatever and get their keys.
@_date: 2018-12-24 03:39:31
If governments agree, and that’s a big IF.
@_date: 2018-12-27 02:37:08
We have to criticize the main problems so they get fixed.
Security is a major one, having a hardware wallet with all your savings is just too risky.
Bitcoin is a good investment but it’s not ready to completely replace fiat, far from it.
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:08:02
Yeah, that’s a Mercedes.
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:05:33
If you have Bitcoin you perfectly understood me, I don’t need to explain it further.
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:05:46
Can’t be seasoned, for them it’s HODL, not HOLD.
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:36:04
The moment I buy it it's the moment it collapses, so I better ignore it.
Good luck to the rest of you!
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:30:58
Until you have, and then you can’t do shit about it, there’s no number to call, no email, no nothing.
And that’s a very big problem.
@_date: 2018-12-15 21:31:38
Get rich quick!
@_date: 2018-12-05 13:44:57
He be like:
@_date: 2018-12-24 22:51:25
Good for the complexity, Bitcoin needs to be KISS 100%.
Regarding safety, major issue there, I don’t have hope it can be fixed in the near future. If you have a problem with your Bitcoin it’s game over, you can’t do shit, and people are rightfully afraid of this.
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:38:44
Speculation, 100% speculation.
It's to risky for me, but good luck to others!
