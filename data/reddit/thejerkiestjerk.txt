Not to worry, I've got [**some great domain name ideas**]( for them. 
Source: I claim to be a professional marketer on reddit.

Edit: I tried to find the cached page but couldn't.  The gist of what I read on the blog was that they're being forced to make changes which won't allow them to work with Wells Fargo anymore, nor will they accept cash deposits.  I tried to track down a source link but couldn't, sorry :/
@_date: 2014-01-02 20:29:40
Meaning it's ok for me to add it to the exceptions list?
@_date: 2014-01-01 01:35:25
Hmm. I tried your suggestion: I cleared ALL my history and cache, restarted FireFox, and I'm still getting same message when I go to cashintocoins.com
I know this isn't a FireFox tech support subreddit, but any ideas why this is suddenly happening?
@_date: 2014-01-21 07:26:49
But what about the fact that many people have on their website or whatever a bitcoin tip address listed.  Wouldn't anyone, including the IRS, be able to follow the blockchain and see all the tips that go to that address?

No identifying info of any kind is required?
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:49:19
Thank you for the explanation. One question though: 2fa authentication?
@_date: 2014-01-21 01:55:35
That would be much appreciated! 
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:38:08
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:31:38
Thank you for this step-by-step explanation!
Question: would it be wise and/or appropriate to buy a counterfeit-bill-marker to test the cash before accepting it?
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:35:28
I'm only interested in buying Bitcoins with cash.  Would I still risk running into this problem?
@_date: 2014-02-19 19:59:09
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:48:01
In person with cash.
@_date: 2014-01-21 05:06:54
Much obliged!
Hopefully I did that tip correctly.
@_date: 2014-02-19 23:41:21
Keep in mind that I am only interested in dealing with cash.  My concern is about safety.  I would rather pay a slight fee than get robbed.
As others in this thread have advised, the escrow is one of the prudent precautions to take.
With that being said, do you still recommend not using the escrow service?  If so, can you please explain why?
@_date: 2014-02-15 02:18:40
No really, I'm honestly asking everyone's opinion.
@_date: 2014-01-21 04:29:15
Los Angeles, in the glorious People's Republic of Kalifornia.
I've heard of localbitcoins.com but I've a bit of trepidation about trying it.
Also, could you expand upon those other things you mentioned?
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:46:29
Thank you for that explanation.
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:42:52
Can you elaborate on what you don't like about their "escrow service"?
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:25:06
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:51:10
@_date: 2014-01-21 06:13:11
Ah, now I understand what you're saying. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-01-21 04:59:12
I'll start searching the interwebs but do you have any trusty links on hand?

Understandable.  It's definitely a big issue in the US.  I'm curious to hear people weigh in with their opinions, so you're still free to join even though you're not in the US :)

100% agreed.


Also 100% agreed.

One more question that doesn't seem to be answered on the lbtc website:
Situation: you're a cash buyer and you find a seller with a reputable account, but that seller doesn't actually meet people.  The seller's instructions are to deposit the cash into an account at one of a list of banks (or credit unions) that the seller lists on his page. 
In this situation, how does it work?  How can the buyer know that when he deposits the cash into the account at a bank or credit union, that he has received the coins?  Where does the tx code come into play?
@_date: 2014-02-19 13:00:52
Ok, I'm gonna have to do some research before I am knowledgeable enough to do that, but thank you.
Also, of the two options you mentioned, is one preferable over the other?
@_date: 2014-01-02 20:22:26
I appreciate the info but I'm having trouble making sense of what the bottom line is.  Should I add cashintocoins.com to the list of exceptions so that FireFox will allow me to view the site?

Yes, OP is curious about the cash aspect of it.
@_date: 2014-01-21 04:25:32
Lol, exactly my point, this is what gives me pause.  Also, there's a real danger of underpants gnomes.

Let me rephrase: cash into bitcoins without identification? We used to have BitInstant, that's gone.  We used to have CashIntoCoins, now they don't take cash.  Right now the only way is LocalBitcoins.  And who knows how long before the gov't goes after them?
There are many reasons and many people for the importance of being able to buy bitcoins anonymously.  In the US, there is now only one option and as I mentioned, who knows how long that will last?
I, as one among many, am interested to see more alternatives popping up.
@_date: 2014-01-02 20:14:31
I already have that extension installed but thanks for the suggestion.
@_date: 2014-01-21 02:14:29
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2014-01-21 06:05:24
What about for people who don't have bank accounts?
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:34:09
Right now planning to buy, but in the future I'd be interested in knowing how to properly sell.
