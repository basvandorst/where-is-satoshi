For those who hate banks/credit cards: don't register.
For those that would like the conveniance, the bank/cc company could:
-provide no chargeback protection for BTC transactions (idk about regulatory stuff regarding thsi)
-tie the registered address (same way they tie your ssn to your name/card) and look at the block chain for all transactions to the address (this could be what they want for regulation &amp; those that don't want the annomity + want to pay taxes)
-they could provide protection if both the sending and recieving address had registered addresses
--problem is, if you got trolled and got sent a bunch of btc or coin you could get in trouble for coin that is not yours (i.e. non registered address &gt; your address)

maybe the bank wouldn't even need to hold the coin? 
you just register your address, just like your house address, and they could give you the protection they do on regular accounts for and only for BTC transactions with other registered addresses

i think there is a market for trusted bitcoin transaction:
i.e. a vendor/provider that only deals with registered addresses and handles the backend
you could then easily opt in and out of such a provider: especially if they don't hold the coin, only the contact info of the address

what I could see happening is similiar to cash nowadays:
you have declared, clean on the books transactions supported by the established networks
off the book transactions that do not have this support
the advantage of bitcoin: a 100k of cash is hard to hide. 1 BTC (2016? :) ) is not

except for the protection it gives in the case of legitimate fraud...
