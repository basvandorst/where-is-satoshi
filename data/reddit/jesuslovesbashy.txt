Gemini charges 1% for every order including limits, to try to prevent this.

Nakamoto is a Brit;  and Szabo is a fascist cunt. Whoever wrote Bitcoin had imagination;  and Szabo has none.

And so is the new york times.

Jesus was an invention of the Roman Emperor as a propaganda piece to destroy Jewish rebellion in Palestine.
And the reason he threw out the money changers is the same reason some places have tried to ban bitcoin:  to preserve the imperial monopoly on coinage.

You're learning.

We need to avenge them.

Both the US and UK use Pakistan for their dirty work. It's obvious to anyone paying attention these gangs work for the queen, and the Pentagon, and their Rothschild buddies.

Yep;  it almost smells like a free market. Or, more accurately, a perverse little sister of one.
