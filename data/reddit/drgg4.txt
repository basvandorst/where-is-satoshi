I just started. Works well! Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 13:35:57
It seems that you are under rebranding. What will you finish? I assume I can still use my old account right?
@_date: 2017-02-20 19:33:14
I've seen people advertising bitsquare for quite a while. So what's so good about it? I've downloaded it and you still need to put your bank account info etc. Not anonymous at all. Also, is there any true anonymous way to sell Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-02-15 01:03:08
Copied here
Step 1: Sell Bitcoin
Step 2: Announce new regulations
Step 3: Price drops
Step 4: Buy Bitcoin
Step 5: ???
Step 6: Profit
I couldn’t stop laughing...
@_date: 2017-02-13 13:05:09
Price is exactly today in history.
@_date: 2017-02-20 21:19:26
I mean there exists some laptop that doesn't have that key. You can't assume that everyone uses Dell etc.
@_date: 2017-02-17 23:22:18
Saw this in the comment section :(
Ummm..... anyone who controls the block chain controls bitcoin. Governments are getting their hooks into it. This is a Trojan horse to a cashless society controlled by corrupt governments. Get into hard assets and liquidate only into cash when you need to make an exchange. Bitcoin will just get sucked into the central bankers version called fedcoin﻿
@_date: 2017-02-13 13:04:10
Ah, not exactly today, but indeed in Feburary. A calendar is a nice idea. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 00:01:56
Cool. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-02-20 16:44:13
Why is it so good? I've downloaded that. But it seems that I still need to enter my bank accounts info etc. How is that anonymous? So what's so good about it? 
@_date: 2017-02-28 13:30:42
Im using breadwallet and airbitz. Are they safe? Any comment is appreciated. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 21:05:12
Do we have that key on laptops?
@_date: 2017-02-20 20:04:00
From some expert in economics (I don't know how to do the rebuttal) :
If Bitcoin has a fix supply at last, the deflationary nature of it will encourage hoarding. In other words, people tend to keep bitscoin in their hands instead of spending them. As the supply decreases its the price will increase, encouraging even more people to safe them rather then spend them. This is call the deflationary spiral. Fewer and fewer bitcoins will be in circulation.
Krugman said “So buying into Bitcoin has, at least so far, been a good investment.
But does that make the experiment a success? Um, no. What we want from a monetary system isn’t to make people holding money rich”
Is there any problem with above statement or is it true?
I don't know economics very well, nor for bitcoin. I just copied and rephrased the main idea here. So free to comment.
@_date: 2017-02-04 03:02:50
Btw, by limits do you mean there's limits in sending and receiving Bitcoins? 
@_date: 2017-02-20 16:37:35

@_date: 2017-02-20 23:03:37
Of course. As he mentioned, bitcoin is good for investment, but not a very good ”currency” which many people claim to be.
@_date: 2017-02-24 23:46:06
Hi again! When will wyre be officially functioning? 
@_date: 2017-03-22 11:21:41
Check if I can post
@_date: 2017-03-30 10:56:37
Never heard of the 1st and the 3rd. But you can suggest any. I won't expect anything, if I know I wouldn't have asked. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 23:05:57
hmmm...I guess your main point is when people have a lot of money they tend to spend it despite the fact that they will get even more money in the future,  hence deflationary spiral broke. am I right or not?
@_date: 2017-02-13 16:32:16
cool. thank you！
@_date: 2017-03-30 10:17:55
What do you mean? I bet here are more alt coin holders than purely bitcoins. And yeah, I used hold, because I hate meme here which makes people irrational. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 21:04:25
Lol. That's rather nice!
@_date: 2017-03-30 10:31:53
I see. So is that a sarcasm he made to say how volatile bitcoin is?
@_date: 2017-03-12 20:57:11
Saw countless times. What does TL;DR mean？
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:08:53
When is the decision made time? In GMT? 21:30?
@_date: 2017-03-30 10:19:46
So is volatile a good thing or not? Usually seems not, but people here makes me think it's good. I'm so lost. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 11:22:17
So is there any other digital coins worth buying?
@_date: 2017-03-22 11:22:47
You know what. I can't say the coin that starts with e...
@_date: 2017-03-30 13:27:54
I won't lose sleep at all since I didn't invest much. But I hate losing, you know. Ehh anyway thanks for your concern 
@_date: 2017-03-30 10:18:42
What...what do you mean? Both of you. I'm lost
@_date: 2017-01-23 19:55:25
What happened to you snapcard? Rank 1 cannot buy any Bitcoins? Is sending and receiving them still functional? 
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:24:23
But I want to leave some in exchange to trade. 
Can I still use polo?
Or where else would you suggest?
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:24:44
wow. i like this analogy. 
cash is the new romance
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:07:44
well, just do whatever you want. i'm not judging, just a suggestion  
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:55:11
dont even try.
dont give hope to some people who dont see the danger behind it.
instread of giving bounty to those figure out whats going on with tether(which should be the job of federal/gov/whatever), why not give bounty to those who are telling people **not to**
* use usdt
* use bitfinex
* or any exchange involving usdt
why not give bounty to those who are telling people **to**
* keep your own key
* invest carefully
* be aware of the possible bubble
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:13:01
Are those people the only ones in nya？
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:30:31
And someone downvoted. Wtf
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:11:44
is bip39 affected? (hd wallets)
or only those normal qt wallets etc?
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:53:30
Please help I still have money there which takes several days to move out (in loans). What should I do now? Will it shut down suddenly like in two days? I hope to get my money out :(
@_date: 2017-04-11 00:42:43
I know what it means in general. But I don't see proper definition here, regarding cryptocurrencies stuff
@_date: 2017-04-19 21:57:36
Not easy for anyone actually. Only handful offers there. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 21:49:19
I see. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-04-22 14:16:12
Yeah. Very individual. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 19:08:21
Do you mean going back to the sender? And he can send it again?
@_date: 2017-04-24 12:19:31
Will pos pose a treat on pow?
@_date: 2017-04-20 17:40:11
@_date: 2017-04-22 14:15:27
The agreement that your are informed the reverse?
@_date: 2017-04-10 19:52:03
By 2 I mean like a single or several pools can control the outcome of segwit, will similarly for exchanges and wallets?
What's "economic majority"?
What if enough blocks signalling segwit, will segwit just be activated or we have to wait for uasf because uasf started? How are these two rules compatible?
And thank you for your answer!
@_date: 2017-04-08 16:29:41
How will uasf begin ?
@_date: 2017-04-20 17:44:51
What does lock time block:xxxxxx mean? I searched that block but my transaction isn't listed. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 19:05:38
Yeah well. We will see. Maybe we are too greedy to deserve decentralisation. 
@_date: 2017-04-22 14:14:44
Look who's talking. 
@_date: 2017-04-22 14:22:53
Sorry I said things that many of you don't like. Actually, why bother. I've sold all my btc. I'm out. Play under censorship if you wish. Core is the god, of course. How stupid i am to say any bad words to it in this subreddit only to get downvoted immediately. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 17:10:38
How would segwit be activated through uasf?
1. Any persentage? For how long? Any website to track?
2. Centralisation problem like we have on miners
3. What if miners refuse to change after uasf? Is it compulsory?
4. Which will happen first, LTC uasf or btc uasf?
5. When will segwit be activated, after meeting the requirements above?
6. What if Wu, or someone has 50%+ of hash power? Is he in 100% control of any decisions in the future?
@_date: 2017-04-22 13:46:49
But that's already reached in hong kong agreement. Core should honour its words. 
@_date: 2017-04-24 22:16:28
Anti bitcoin? Seriously? I'm new so maybe that why I haven't felt that way. Could you elaborate please thanks
@_date: 2017-04-20 19:07:20
Btw, isn't btc itself somewhat centralised the crypto market? It kinds of acts like medium of exchange of cryptos now. I transferred btc today, only to sell one crypto and buy another (two coins not supported on the same exchange) and exchanges, ah, another example of centralisation. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 17:46:48
I feel bitcoin is in really bad situation. Who would ever use such a slow and expensive system? Not me. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 18:06:00
Hi I check the website. What will happen for those &gt;=12 hours and few &lt;10? Will the transaction be stuck forever?
@_date: 2017-04-20 17:59:38
@_date: 2017-04-08 16:29:13
How will uasf begin ?
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:02:03
How come I'm pumping the coin. Wtf. r/btc is filled with that and here is almost silent. That's why I'm worried. No one talks about this as if it's no big deal. Well I would be so happy if it's indeed no big deal. Will btc be forked? Will the reputation of btc collapse? And, price. Yes I do care. That's also a reason. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:30:20
What do you mean by people holding btc will dump bcc? Do you mean bcc is effectively a fork?
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:44:06
If btc forks, will I hold 4 kinds of btc?
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:12:20
So in my understanding, bcc is forked from btc. Is that correct? And a fork will damage btc. That's why I'm worried. I think explaining it will be better for the market. Say before posting this I was worried. If I post and get good discussion I will be more confident in btc. And if I post but get downvoted or no one said meaningful things, I will be even more worried. I really think there should be one post pinned and explaining bcc is shit and why. If you don't talk about it, you give up room for your enemy. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:33:58
If btc forks, will I hold 4 kinds of btc?
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:04:02
And as I said, it was downvoted. Why. And most people are just saying things like you said, about how stupid that is.
