You are completely misunderstanding what the definition of socialism actually means. It is describing the counter-philosophy to the exploitation of workers through capitalism by removing profit from others workers labor. It is basically saying that you should reap the benefits of the amount of money produced by the work that you do, not the goods. It is essentially removing bosses and executives who earn money through other workers and instead the workers receiving their profits directly from the labor they produce. For example on average a McDonald's worker makes $8 and on average they produce $100 worth of goods an hour. Socialism corrects this because it logically should be the money of the laborer. You are misinterpreting socialism. Bitcoins are entirely capitalistic. It is economic freedom where individuals have the right to do what they want in an economic market. I agree they are at opposite spectrums but you are misunderstanding what socialism is.

Uh have you read Communist Manifesto? Because the definition that you quoted is word for word from Marx...

You're delusional.

Oh god. You are so misinformed. The fact that you just said that proves that you haven't read any Marx literature or have any clue what you are saying. Marx wrote the communist manifesto and it theorizes the movement of a capitalist society to a socialist society THEN to a communist society. HE is the one who created both philosophies and HE is the one that said that socialism is a PATHWAY to communism. They are not separate ideologies at all. They are both Marxist philosophies that come after each other. Socialism is a PATHWAY while communism is the end goal.
Like I said... Go read the Communist Manifesto.

Did you read my post? I just said you are misinterpreting the definition that you said was wrong which is not really a debate since it is exactly what Marx said.

It's not opinion. It's like giving a definition and you disagreeing that the definition is right and then giving your own definition. But okay buddy.
