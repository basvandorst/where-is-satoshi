Try [CoinBits]( 
It's a viable option to backdoor Coinbase. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 02:22:05
Could have paid only $1 for this same exact transaction on [CoinBits](

Sir, that was my comment. Do you know how to use Reddit? ��
@_date: 2019-05-22 17:32:57
Works for Boomers. LOL

When the stock market goes down Bitcoin will go up. Thus proving it is a great store of value.

�� I'll be back in 3 months to brag.
@_date: 2018-12-13 04:53:58
It's currently holding pretty well above low $3,000s, surprisingly. I have $2500 for the extreme floor.
@_date: 2019-05-22 17:32:33
Tough crowd. LOL

I buy Bitcoin weekly with [CoinBits](  
Micro-investing with a dollar-cost-average strategy. 
If I lose, I lose a little. 
If I win, I win big! 
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:09:39
Add [CoinBits]( to this list.  
They have the lowest fees @ $1/transaction.  
It's a great way to get your feet wet without overexposing your portfolio. It's basically the dollar-cost-average (DCA) strategy which is how you should be viewing Bitcoin anyway. Long-term investing...

Sort of related: $SNAP put contracts have been a gold mine. A literal treasure trove. At least the app is good for my portfolio. ��
@_date: 2018-12-30 19:25:29
Try [CoinBits]( .
$1/transaction no matter the amount.
@_date: 2018-12-31 23:47:09
I'm still coming back to brag…��
@_date: 2018-12-11 01:53:54
So, we're bullish on coins that have the blessings of The Digital Currency Group Connection &amp; Coinbase? Asking for my crypto portfolio. lol
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:43:51
First, my condolences for your loss. Your mentor was wise. Never buy anything you wouldn't mind holding onto for 10 years.
Let me also add that you should only allocate a small portion of your entire investing budget into crypto.
Micro-invest with an app like CoinBits. The weekly purchases are small so they don't hurt your cash flow but it adds up after a while. If you lose, who cares? It was only $5 a week. Some people spend that daily just on coffee or cigarettes.
But if you win, You win big! And I'm almost certain that the people who dollar cost average over time will not feel the pain of the dips but will massively enjoy the highs. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 15:54:22
I'd have to agree with this statement. If the stock market falls but Bitcoin rises because people see it as a store of value, we're off to the Moon. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 12:26:21
Some basic chart analysis.
@_date: 2018-12-31 23:20:58
Try [CoinBits]( if you're looking to save on fees.

@_date: 2018-12-14 03:28:32
There's also [CoinBits]( at $1/transaction flat fee but they're US only.
@_date: 2018-12-19 16:58:37
Exactly. You can use an app like [CoinBits]( to invest a little bit at a time.
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:56:20
Let me help you out...
BTC is connected to USD because that's what the masses are used to. 
If you can't relate to people you can't migrate them to anything. That's Sales 101.
It'll go right over their head. And Bitcoin still goes over people's heads.

Add [CoinBits]( to this list:
**Overview:** Weekly spare change round-ups invested in Bitcoin with $1/transaction fee (super-low). Can also round-up spare change from credit card purchases.
**Payouts:** Monthly with Bitcoin.
**Commission:** $5/referral
**Marketing Tools:** Dashboard comes with affiliate link and tracks amount earned.

1.5% still puts you below the rate of inflation.  
Which means, **your bank is guaranteeing that you'll lose money**.  
At least with Bitcoin, you have a chance to actually make a return on the investment.

Debbie Downer? Is that you? ��
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:59:19
The good news is...
Bitcoin is unlike anything on Wall St. so this is irrelevant. 
But fun to entertain I guess.
@_date: 2018-12-14 03:51:02
This headline is misleading. They are extortionists who demanded Bitcoin.
The bears need to chill.

If anyone else is into singing, here's another app you can sing up and earn with: [coinbits](

When it comes to investing, the most intelligent (and safest) strategy is **dollar-cost-averaging**.
You buy a little, consistently, and let it pile up over time.  
The biggest mistake people make is overexposing themselves to an asset or asset class too fast.   
Let's say Brom has $10,000 to invest.   
He could put all $10k into the market now. But then he'd be at the mercy of that price. And chances are, Bitcoin will go down if you purchased today.  
You could buy $1,000 now and $1,000 at the next price dip and again and again over time. Maybe your next purchase is only $500. This will lower the average cost of BTC in your portfolio. 
Which means you'll set yourself up for higher returns.  
You can do this manually or you can do it automatically with an app like [CoinBits]( \- which makes weekly BTC micro-investments. You set the multiplier and it handles the rest. Even a slacker can pull it off.
They're a Coinbase partner but with lower fees - $1 per transaction cost.
Don't get  caught with your pants down dumping a lot in now. Your portfolio will only be red in a month. But if you DCA,  your losses won't hurt as bad and your upside looks greener.  
@_date: 2018-12-15 05:27:46
Yeah. That process is a pain. 
Try [CoinBits]( 
Their KYC process is much easier. 
Simple interface. Easy to buy. Lowest fees on BTC.
