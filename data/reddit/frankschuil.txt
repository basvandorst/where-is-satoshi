Hi, Frank Schuil here from Safello.

The Blockchain vs Bitcoin debate is shifting back towards Bitcoin = ok. Big difference from even six months ago. 
The access to UK banking network is a fair point today, but regulation is coming and the conclusion that they would not have that longer term perspective and dismiss Bitcoin is premature.

Hi, Frank Schuil here, CEO of bitcoin exchange Safello ( 
We are based in Sweden working with one of the top four banks in the country. They are very helpful to us and even assist in our expansion. Similarly KnC miner is having a good relationship with their bank. I don't necessarily believe there is unwillingness to cooperate with Bitcoin businesses if they are fully compliant. With the stricter AML policies the banks have however become more risk-averse and some have taken a Board decision stance against Bitcoin companies for the time being. On top of that there was the case with Kapiton that made headline news in Sweden putting further pressure on the bank relationships. The tendency to publicly fight the banks as a scare tactic is counter-productive and actually causes more harm than it does any good. Instead of fighting the banks we need to educate them, because as unfortunate as it may be to some, with the banks on our side the Bitcoin adoption goes faster.

Hi there, CEO of Safello here. I have actually bought a Trezor and like what you guys are doing. We were the ones mentioned in this article, so I thought I'd share some tips on getting the media to write about you.
* 1. Be sure to write an actual press release. I am somewhat surprised by the amount of companies that neglect this.
* 2. Make sure to present information in the best possible way. We use pr.co to make our releases media rich and complete with bite sized content to quote us from. Have a look at our press room: 
* 3. Approach journalists some time in advance - 24 hours is often enough- before making an announcement and preferably give them an exclusive. Especially with non-Bitcoin media it is important to try to secure exposure this way.
* 4. Keep journalists informed about ongoing releases and news without spamming them with non-relevant news.
For the record, we have never paid Coindesk or any outlet to publish a story and we know Coindesk would put paid content up as a sponsored article.
Hopefully these tips can help you in the future. Wishing you guys the best of luck with the product and perhaps at some point we can integrate Trezor into the Safello Wallet. For those of you who are curious about what we're up to visit 
Edit: spellcheck
Kind regards,

I guess that depends who you write in that case. This would be more of an  thing. Perhaps the problem is also that they have nothing to compare it to.

Hi wrongel,
- We don't store your coins, it's a biggie - common wallet is not the way for blockchain to go
- Our turnaround on the actual delivery is often quicker than an exchange as we optimise the payment methods rather than work with crediting accounts. Some are even real-time.
- Its a novice way of getting into bitcoin, pretty much about convenience. For us the exchange part is merely the prelude to activating actual usage. Exchanges tailor to a different segment.
- The fees are steep
- We want to sharpen up the handling of SOFORT payments before offering it as a payment option again. It is sensitive to fraud as they work with a man-in-the-middle attack to logging into your bank.
He actually worked with Safello before ICEdrill. The big let down for investors was that Hashfast never delivered. It's a sad thing to lose money of course, as I have with some of my investments. In terms of Safello and ICEdrill there is no connection whatsoever to the actual venture.

@_date: 2015-01-19 14:29:54
Rightfully so.
@_date: 2015-01-19 07:58:45
So, to be clear. We are a bitcoin broker where we match an order with the price of one of our liquidity providers. This means it is NOT a p2p exchange with an order book. This is partly automated, but unfortunately often manual due to the limitations of the bank.
The important difference is that we do not hold client funds in bitcoin or fiat. We execute it as soon as possible or return the money to the customer. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:02:41
As some stated here, they are in Europe and have been for some time now. Of course their main focus has been the US and a stronger expansion plan is surely in their roadmap.

Money arrives on our account, we match it with a liquidity provider and send the bitcoins. It's therefore a bit more expensive as we pay a percentage fee to our liquidity providers, but operationally it's more sound.

Understood and I have forwarded your comments to the team. Some of them are valid and we will try to improve. Our spread is 2% on each side, but they aren't fees. We used to state fees, but it has VAT implications to continue to do so. Hence we execute the price we display on website at the time we can execute the order. We are awaiting the outcome of the European court case on VAT to change that. Perhaps there's a different wording possible to make it more transparent, I'll check with legal.

It's just a spread model instead of fees. The spread is dependent on the liquidity partner's percentage, our percentage (2%) and the forex fee. Basically much like the buy and sell price you would have with an order book on any of the exchanges.

Hi there, CEO Safello here. This is what it says on an order:
Due to the limitations of the bank we have to process it manually and we get payment information during weekdays only. Hence right now we cannot execute the order during weekends.

Obviously we announced a PoC around Bitcoin, so the notion that they wouldn't want to be open about it is not true. My comment related to other banks and financial institutions that obfuscate the bitcoin part by announcing blockchain trials while in fact it's Bitcoin under the hood. The Barclays announcement we made was the exact opposite.

Hi Andy,
Frank Schuil here, CEO Safello, thank you for the ping. Our support team reached out to you today around the same time you posted this. I'm not sure if you received this, perhaps it ended up in a spam folder?
Your funds have not arrived. Please bear in mind that banks, especially German ones, sometimes block transactions to Bitcoin exchanges. Unfortunately we cannot do anything about this, neither can we avoid the KYC procedures as it is required by law. Also note that this will soon be common practise across Europe: 
Safello has had to follow the European AML directive since 2013 as we are a registered financial institution in Sweden.
If you have any questions feel free to dm me or contact our support staff via support

What was striking to me is this recent article ( on Medium  by the International Rescue Committee where they photograph the contents of refugees' bags. In most cases you will see a charger and a phone brought along. Then to think their journey typically costs around $1000 (see Hans Rosling on the subject:  and you start to realise that these refugees have life savings to protect and the means to store funds in a brain wallet. 
It's been said before and I'll repeat it, the example in the video is not secure. Please read the comments sections for safe brain wallet usage. I regret not making that clear during my talk.
@_date: 2015-11-12 20:51:39
To quote the article: "Barclays contacted us to clarify that it will not be directly accepting bitcoin deposits. "No Bitcoin is travelling through Barclays systems. We are working with some charity clients in a proof of concept to understand how Bitcoin payments might help with their fund raising and fund disbursement needs," a Barclays spokesperson wrote in an e-mail.
But...wouldn't rule it out that you could do that all through Safello ;)
@_date: 2015-03-18 20:15:54
I guess you never stored any funds with MtGox. We are creating a platform where we don't hold customer's funds while we aim to provide enriched utility. 
With our exchange we built pipelines to the banks to convert fiat currency into crypto currency and vice versa. You have tipping and btc for services to grow this market, but fiat-to-crypto exchange is still the fastest way for Bitcoin adoption to take off. And to connect to the fiat economy you need to follow the existing AML legislation. Having said that, it's not the end game. Not for the market, not for us.
@_date: 2015-03-19 08:34:40
Glad to hear! We have some news about this that we will announce on Monday where it looks like the route to re-enter has opened. Slightly vague, but will be clear on Monday. The get back in the UK is our primary focus and I am actually moving to London for the coming months to push that agenda.
As for the bitcoin buy volume, the increase was partly due to the UK market entry where it accounted for 24% of the volume. Certainly a sign of its potential, but not accounting for the entire increase which was more general market / platform growth.
The news of coming Monday shifted our focus to do an internal round instead of a Series A to use it as leverage later this year. We believe it can significantly and positively impact both the amount we can raise and the valuation we can raise. 
As for the crowdfunding part on top of the internal round, we felt that its a great way to get the community behind our platform in a way that aligns our interests.

We do make money, but not enough to both be profitable and invest sufficient amounts in product development to stay competitive. It's a balancing act. There are only so few companies profitable in this space. Actually, for my reference, can you list some? Bitpay, Circle, Coinbase, Xapo, Chain, 21? Perhaps Blockchain.info, those guys care about the bottom line.
As for Roger, feel free to ask him about Safello.
@_date: 2015-03-22 17:44:08
We are essentially a broker, sometimes others call us an exchange, but we try to avoid that wording.
We have projections prepared for the round and historic numbers to compare them against. To comment on expenses, right now we cover 25%, so a ten-fold is not needed to reach profitability. Our historic spending actually shows that we've been able to grow without increasing our expenses. Instead we have optimised our operation to spend there where it matters. Perhaps our spending is conservative and would likely increase to accelerate growth if opportune, but historic numbers and the strategic partnerships in the pipeline in our opinion justify the assumptions. If anything we want to show that we don't want to go on a spending spree just because we raised more funds.

Thanks for elaborating, it is an interesting discussion to have. Everybody's chasing the killer app. The ecosystem as I see it is:
* Protocol
* Mining
* Infrastructure
* Application layer
Even with the example you describe, you need pipelines to drive conversion to get crypto in the hands of the average consumer. I personally use the oil refinery analogy. Banks are sitting on oil reserves (fiat) where we are building the pipelines (local payment methods) to Safello's refinery (into crypto). Other assumptions are:
* You can build a parallel economy outside fiat
* You can cryptofy the existing economy (altcoins)
* There are other ways to get people into crypto (pay for services, tipping, etc)
For me those alternatives aren't strong enough (yet). Of course there might be something revolutionary app just around the corner. Until that surfaces I go by the assumption that we're actually still building the infrastructure here - early Internet days. 
As for your share question. The FundedByMe campaign is a pledge. We will set up an SPIV (Special Purpose Investment Vehicle) that is owned by the crowd that holds common shares - same shares I as a Founder have- in Safello. A typical legal framework for crowd funding campaigns.

Despite how awesome that video looks, we paid less that $1500 for it. Heavily discounted to build the portfolio of the animation company. If you can find something of that quality cheaper, you win.
To address your point, it's fair to say that we haven't reached profitability yet. To counter that we have cut expenses and optimised our margins - we are making money - while we push forward to enter new markets.

Hi ck,
* All shareholding including mine are subject to potential dilution of future investment rounds. However, today there are no preferential shares in Safello, so everyone has the same type of shares.
*  We saw a surge of usage with the UK market entry. On Monday we have some news with regards to that, which potentially puts us in a position to re-enter the market. Can't disclose this yet, but stay tuned.

We'll have to see and find out, now don't we.

Curious to hear your thoughts beyond the other two ways I mentioned to accelerate adoption.
We will prioritise growth over dividends for some time and this should in any case be seen as a long term investment in Safello. As for investor benefit, of course the simple answer is ownership in the company that we aim to grow into a global winner where we aim to make the shares liquid through an exit or IPO. My personal goal would be to make them liquid earlier than is typical in today's startup climate, but that's not an easy task.

Hi Craig, 
We've been operating since 2013 as a regulated brokerage in Sweden. The company is registered with the Swedish FSA. We are banked by a Swedish top 4 bank and backed by leading investors behind companies such as iZettle, Spotify and Coinbase. If you have any specific concerns feel free to reach out to [support

It amazes me, no matter what obscure article I check out, I always seem to find a comment from you :) Tip of the hat to you sir!

Can't lie, we were pretty happy he agreed to do the first transfer :) SEB has not closed the door on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:04:04
The reality is that to convert fiat money into bitcoin and vice versa you need the banks or you need to start a bank. Since we're not in a position to buy a bank license there is no other option than to cooperate with the banks to make the conversion happen. 
Long term customers can pull their money out of the bank. For instance, we have a cooperation with Handelsbanken and some customers are actually switching from SEB, Nordea and Swedbank to Handelsbanken because there they are allowed to buy bitcoins. As bitcoins grow this will become the modus operandi for banks, they will lose customers.

Zero game mentality. At the fragile state of Bitcoin it's not the right mindset to go for the monopoly imo. Make the pie bigger I'd say.

Buying in Sweden:
For those who want to buy Bitcoins in Sweden, we have Handelsbanken direct payments integrated and accept bankgiro payments. 
Outside Sweden:
In the Netherlands we have all the banks through iDeal and for the rest of Europe we accept SEPA transfers.
We will add more when we can.
Hope this helps.

Welcome! 
It's good for everyone to understand that it's a political process with the banks. They are operating under strict KYC/AML laws like every other financial institution (as are we) and have been confronted with bitcoin fraud cases. 
At the same time this may cannibalize or kill their own business in the long term if they don't adapt to a crypto world. So for them to cooperate with bitcoin and bitcoin players at this stage is a big thing and that's why they are all watching each other. Sooner or later I do expect a domino effect when the first big bank jumps on the crypto bandwagon. At that point others will realize what happens and follow suit. 
Fidor bank in Germany was one of those signals, but it takes a bigger bank to start the shift. BoA recent news ( is a positive indicator of things to come.

Practically the big four banks are the only interesting ones to work with. We have multiple bank accounts to receive money, but it's about the direct payments solutions to serve customers that want to buy instantly.
Our recent survey showed that its the biggest request from our users to have more direct payment methods on our website.
Also, as far as I know Skandiabanken has no direct payment solution. Do they?
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:33:30
We have tried and got rejected. If you have a contact do let us know.

We have done some manual sales for the exact reasons you describe and continue to do so for the time being. Our automated sales will hopefully be soon here, we have had some delays with the implementation due to the recent price spike. 
As for the spread, we actually don't apply a spread but a services fee and we execute at exact market price from our liquidity partners. The problem is that the display price was off. That should be fixed by now though. If you encounter more display price issues then please let us know on support [at] safello  [dot] com. Regarding the "confirm" button, depending on the payment method we either execute immediately - with direct payments - or we execute upon receiving the money - in case of bankgiro.
Regarding taxes, as far as I know the capital gain tax is 30%, perhaps there are some exceptions if you are a founder of a company, I'm not a Swedish tax expert - I'm Dutch ;)

They are one of the big four in Sweden:

I reckon he's commenting on the law suit in a fancy non-descriptive incomprehensible manner. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:49:25
We actually have done it for numerous customers and we give out proper receipts. You receive the money from us, a Swedish company with a registration at Finansinspektionen, no problem. Contact support
To elaborate, the issues we have are direct payment related, not bankgiro. The customers who executed large sales with us never got any complaints from their bank disapproving the transaction as far as we know. We do need to do extended KYC and you need to declare capital gain tax.
Edit: I recommend Handelsbanken in any case btw.

Hi all, Frank Schuil here, CEO of Swedish bitcoin company Safello that was mentioned in the article. 
It wasn't us who got rejected. We were actually progressing with SEB and had an ongoing dialogue and accounts set up. We suspect a non-compliant competitor of ours was refused and consequently talked to the media. It set us back months in time as SEB decided to close our accounts that we just established after the article came out. Very disappointing and a wag of the finger to those who seek revenge through the media.
On a positive note, we have very productive discussions with the other Swedish banks and will continue to engage in a dialogue with SEB when and where we can. To be continued.
