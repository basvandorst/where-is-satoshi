But I expect the Chinese miners will have an advantage; they have very cheap electricity and then they probably also the hardware before anyone else ... there is also a very high probability that you will get more coins by just buying them on an exchange: for example kraken, coinbase, bitstamp etc.

It really depends on what you want to do... 
If you want to send coins for free to other coinbase users then sure; 
Use coinbase as a 'checkings account' 
But if you just want to keep your investment secure without making transactions often then you could simply use the coinbase vault service or create a BIP38 paperwallet.
If you want control and 'be you own bank' the I would recommend breadwallet or mycelium.
@_date: 2017-02-24 22:14:05
Contrary to what many will write about coinbase... 
Yes it is better to have bitcoins on a BIP38 paperwallet at multiple locations... 
But coinbase is secure and I would trust them short term.

It really depends on the amount and what you want to do with "your" coins(they are not really yours when they are on coinbase(Just like the fiat you lended to the bank)). 
If you have a lot of coins and you want to spend them, then yes buy a hardware wallet 
If you just want to save(hodl) them for ten years you might as well just print a paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:49:05

You could run bitcoin core to support the network, remember to open port 8333.

No transaction is free. In the old world the fees are merely hidden from the consumer.
Sometimes when I buy stuff in a foreign currency I have to pay arbitrage and the webshop is pay 2.7% for the transaction. 
Bitcoin can still compete with credit cards but not for long - we need 2. layer technology, but I guess that litecoin gets it first. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 13:35:54

I would argue that the wealth inequality is much worse in the non-bitcoin world, some 70-80 people owns +50% of everything. People(like Erik Voorhees, Roger Ver) who have earned/bought a lot of coins early on have reinvested in the infrastructure.
Money should have value, I have silver/gold coins that has a fiat denomination it is funny that nobody would seriously spend them as regular fiat. 
Did you know that Erik Voorhees sees himself as a democrat. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:57:23
Here is what I would do if I just started using bitcoins:
1. Make a backup of your wallet/seed.
2. Dollar cost average. 
3. Hodl. 
4. ? 
5. hodl
6. If you own just one bitcoin you will be in the top 4% of the crypto elite(assuming everyone has their stash in one address..).

Bitcoin is a distributed ledger and a blockchain.
But any distributed ledger and a blockchain does not have the immutable quality that bitcoin has.
The difference between a distributed ledger and a blockchain is that the distributed ledger doesn't necessarily have a blocks(proof of work/proof of authority/Proof of stack etc).

An attacker that controls more than 50% of the network's computing power can, for the time that he is in control, exclude and modify the ordering of transactions. This allows him to:
    Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.
    Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
    Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks
The attacker can't:
    Reverse other people's transactions
    Prevent transactions from being sent at all (they'll show as 0/unconfirmed)
    Change the number of coins generated per block
    Create coins out of thin air
    Send coins that never belonged to him
With less than 50%, the same kind of attacks are possible, but with less than 100% rate of success. For example, someone with only 40% of the network computing power can overcome a 6-deep confirmed transaction with a 50% success rate.
It's much more difficult to change historical blocks, and it becomes exponentially more difficult the further back you go. As above, changing historical blocks only allows you to exclude and change the ordering of transactions. It's impossible to change blocks created before the last checkpoint.
Since this attack doesn't permit all that much power over the network, it is expected that no one will attempt it. A profit-seeking person will always gain more by just following the rules, and even someone trying to destroy the system will probably find other attacks more attractive. However, if this attack is successfully executed, it will be difficult or impossible to "untangle" the mess created -- any changes the attacker makes might become permanent.

And his concern is that lightning hubs will be centralized... But if it an open network anyone could run a hub. 
Personally I see it as an opportunity for everyone to become visa/data hub/notary/etc.
A good reason for enabling segwit is that bitcoin would increase in price and thereby make him richer.

The reason why it wasn't true for the first 7 years, is because it was new technology.


I would argue that it is false, since fee-less transaction are very rarely gets confirmed.

If you would like mine .. then this is probably a good bet:
But I expect the Chinese miners will have an advantage; they have very cheap electricity and then they probably also get the hardware before anyone else ... there is also a very high probability that you will get more coins by just buying them on an exchange: for example kraken, coinbase, bitstamp etc.
But if you would like to help Bitcoin network then I recommend that you run the bitcoin core client and open port 8333 just so you have more than 8 connections.

Even with the /s this is a highly sensitive subject. 
This is the reason why I'm into bitcoin and not some shitcoin that will hardfork when it seems appropriate

Well there is dash, but I would not recommend it as a store of value.

You are not late. 
There are not that many bitcoiners ~250000 in this sub... I mean we are competing with subs like ..

The easiest crypto to buy with fiat is bitcoin.
Most other coins are shitcoins.

I'm actually also against the idea that there should be two coins... 
I guess one of them will die very fast, but there are some cool features that will be enabled after segwit.

I've got a women...  I have always been redpilled, I guess that is why she sticks around, when men do as the women says it is just sad. 
Money doesn't buy the right women, you should go to the gym. Women want protection. 
I would not retire, you should work with whatever you find interesting and is able to make money with.

I'm eth classic kind of guy... 
When you don't fear the fork you don't fear the store of value some people are confused about the fuel price! some might think it has some kind of intrinsic value.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:48:28
I agree! in the mean time: 
Why is segwit more controversial than blocksize?
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:01:01
It is always good to take your coins of an exchange... But not because of UASF
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:09:17
You should write down those 12 words as a backup, unless you use the coinbase app(coinbase is the paypal of bitcoin, and not really bitcoin). 
If you lose your phone and the 12 words the coins are gone, most likely forever.

I think it would be good for bitcoin if China banned mining... 
That would separate the producers of ASICs and miners

you might think about what you used as a password or if you could have written it down somewhere

There will come a fork. 
If you hold the keys yourself then you wouldn't have a problem.

Yes! but it might be hard to get the other currency out of the other country.

Trezor or Ledger are the most used I guess..

Fiat is debt.

There is a good list here: 
But I would recommend trezor, ledger nano s.

After I found out about all that stuff...  I have started to eat clean food/somewhat paleo.

Nope. 
But I would rather have an app that does one thing good than ten things mediocre. 
 
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:02:49
I would recommend an exchange for larger amounts, you could use a broker if you only were planning on buying small amounts.
The reason to use localbitcoin is that you want somewhat privacy.
@_date: 2017-06-12 06:15:10
Why would you want such a small amount?
@_date: 2017-06-19 19:05:32

at least you might have better security next time.
@_date: 2017-06-16 22:13:12
control?     ? 
Isn't better to hold some value in bitcoin in case of a collapse... 
The collapse might not be an eternal emergency, so bitcoin could help you store value without a government.  
You could even use bitcoin to take a plane out of your country with cheapair.

Bitcoiners that have been here for some years don't care about 10-20% swings..

You can use tor on mycelium, it is also one of the most trusted wallets out there.

Imagine if there wasn't a tax demand for fiat! then it wouldn't have much value. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:19:38
Yes they can and you can but nobody would run the code...
zCoins PoW MTP is not really a new idea as far as I can see....  There is a lot of ASIC resistant alt-coins.. 
Just because it is not likely that ASICs are created to day doesn't mean that someone wouldn't do it in the future. 
Bitcoin is lucky that it survived the ASICs mining transformation.

Since $2000 happened I only use the soap, where the main point is that it doesn't contain paraben and perfume. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:24:19
The answer is that it doesn't matter if you want to run an application verifying it is only important in the current moment and if people accept it then it is fine - hashing power doesn't really matter because people still need to trust other people in an organization or election. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:06:32

Bitcoin will survive

Even large exchanges bulk transactions together... sometime the hot wallet is empty...  
If it is a large exchange i wouldn't be too worried
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:53:55
This is in $ but still a good method for buying a lot of coins 
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:43:23
I don't carry my full node around... 
When you are doing local trade it is much easier to carry a phone.
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:06:32
Or some other language... 
I would recommend English, since that is what most wallets supports.
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:32:17
The real innovation is multi-signature, and we don't need ethereum for that.  
@_date: 2017-06-17 12:33:52
Yes the price of ETH could go up, but does it matter if the all the ICOs are crappy they would have to spend the ETH in order to do whatever they said they would do! find one good project here: 
The real thing is that the companies that support ethereum! they will probably make some fine private blockchains and make some procedures more automated
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:34:49
I would see It as a coinbase welcome bonus.

It is a good idea to make a local web of traders

@_date: 2017-06-19 07:07:21
I blame Jaxx
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:04:24
I have a peercoin feeling about ethereum.
@_date: 2017-06-16 21:26:23
 api? 
or you could use a payment processor... bitpay, coinbase etc
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:35:34
"admitting it", there is a difference between on-chain and off-chain transactions, there is value in being decentralized but it is not *gratis*.  
I have no doubt that 2,3,4 layer options will be for the masses. on-chain transactions would only be for large settlements or for closing payment channels.
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:11:25
You could look into tumblebit.. 
I like the idea that the protocol is simple adding complexity make is more difficult to work with. 
You should run a UASF node if you believe in tumblebit.
