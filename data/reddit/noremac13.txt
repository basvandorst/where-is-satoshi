I feel like alot of people are overreacting about this.  Not to say that some shady shit didn't go down, because I'm sure it did, but people are saying stuff that doesn't add up.
One thing I see repeated is that they "gave no warning".  [They posted on their blog months ago that they had planned to add BCH support by January 1st](  So they were early, but they also tweeted 2 hours before it launched saying it would go live.  Maybe not the best warning, but to say they gave no warning is just false.
Also the reason for the crazy price is not because of manipulation, or at least not completely, it was due to a few factors.  I was watching the whole thing unfold earlier to day, and it was very apparent to me what was going to happen.
Firstly they opened the market in post-only mode, meaning only limit orders could be posted to the order book and no market taker orders were being accepted.  This allows the order book to be built up to provide liquidity for potential buyers.  As I was watching the order book I noticed something very concerning.  There were FAR more buy orders than sell orders, and there was a massive buy wall being built of 5000-6000 coins at around the 3100 level.  In contrast there were probably not even 5000-6000 total coins for sale on the sell side, and the opposing sell wall was only a mediocre 80 coins or so.  I had been telling everyone at the time that once they opened the market to taker orders the price was instantly going to blast up to 10k or so, completely eating the sell-side order book, and it almost made it there.  I can only assume this was a combination of GDAX underestimating user demand (not allowing enough orders to be built up on the sell side before opening the market), a bunch of idiots blindly FOMO'ing and putting in huge market buys no matter what price they get filled at, newbies confusing it with actual Bitcoin and thinking they were getting bitcoin for 4k, and the massive lag that began once the market opened.  Alot of people probably thought they were buying at like 4k when in reality their orders were being filled at 8k+.
Not to defend Coinbase/GDAX or anything, and I definitely agree they could have handled the situation better, but let's be real Coinbase has a monopoly on the transfer of fiat to BTC.  It's like the Walmart of buying crypto, and it isn't going anywhere.  If it does we are basically all fucked because the general public is totally clueless and they only know what the news reports on.

Oh yeah, not sure if they have an app.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:28:52
Lower than zero?
Coinbase/GDAX has been the only place I've used where I can start from my bank and end up with coins in my wallet or an exchange without paying any fees along the way.
ACH deposits are free, limit buy orders on GDAX are free, and they even pay your network fee when you withdraw.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:55:20
Yeah Coinbase is really just a convenience service for people that find trading on exchanges to daunting. That's why they are able to get away with charging above spot price and a hefty fee on top of that
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:46:56
To be fair though places like Coinbase aren't exchanges. They act more like broker intermediaries and interact with the actual exchange on your behalf so you don't get overwhelmed. As a result they charge much higher fees for their convenient service.
Most exchanges also don't bridge the gap between fiat and crypto by allowing the actual purchase of coins with a bank or credit card. As the name implies they just facilitate the exchange from one coin to another. Out of the ones you recommended I am not too familiar with BitStamp and Kraken but I know for sure the other three don't allow you to purchase coins, so as far as I'm concerned they can't be competitors to Coinbase since they don't even have the same functionality.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:30:31
Only buy on GDAX.  You can sign in there on your Coinbase account and any balances you have on Coinbase can transfer between the two.
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:29:43
I believe it is Global Digital Asset Exchange.

The point is the actual amount used for actual transactions is so much less and that number is wildly inflated from all the trading and speculation. Crypto right now is just a glorified game of digital hot potato just passing the same coins back and forth thousands of times.
I'd be curious to see data for actual transactions people made to make real purchases and not just gamble on the price.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:49:41
Anyone know if they are planning to do this or something similar with the B2X fork as well?
@_date: 2019-10-04 04:37:57
Didn't they used to be free?
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:06:57
Ah I guess they are, had to look that one up.  I didn't realize anyone was insuring cryptocurrency at this point but that still only covers theft.  If Coinbase were to shut down or be forcefully closed by government regulations your money would still be lost whether it were insured or not.
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:16:50
Because Coinbase is a broker, not an exchange.  Brokers have high fees and aren't instant which is why they need that price spread to make sure they don't lose money when they go to execute trades on your behalf.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:53:25
Because you don't own it and it makes it much more vulnerable to theft or loss.  They could get hacked and you lose your coins, they could go out of business and you lose your coins, they could just straight up steal your coins, or whatever other disaster scenario you could imagine.
At the very least you would want to store your coins on a wallet on your PC which removes alot of those scenarios but preferably you want it in something offline like a paper wallet or hardware wallet.

I have this one bookmarked because it is too funny.
Someone sent ~$7.5m worth of BTC for around 15 cents during the time when the mempool was all backed up from the BCH drama... and it confirmed.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:04:16
Yeah GDAX and Coinbase are linked and you can transfer instantly and freely between them as much as you want.  You can either deposit directly to GDAX or if you already have a pending deposit on Coinbase that is fine too since you can just send it over to GDAX instantly for free.  To avoid fees on GDAX you need to buy/sell using limit orders and not market orders.  You can kind of watch the price movement and maybe get a bit of a discount if you put your order in below the current price, but just make sure you don't put your order in at the current price or it will execute as a market order and you will be charged a fee.
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:19:56
That's how you should be using it.  It's basically the easiest way I know to buy Bitcoin with a bank account or credit card, but isn't meant to be used to store it.  That goes for any online wallet though.  Unless it is a tiny amount that wouldn't be worth transferring to a cold wallet because of the fees.
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:23:23
I haven't used Gemini but from what I can tell yes it is an exchange.
The reason to use the easier option is for people that don't understand or aren't comfortable with using the actual exchange which is GDAX.  Coinbase brokers trades on their behalf and the user knows exactly what they are getting before they agree to anything.  With GDAX you could easily make a mistake entering in your orders or lose money due to market slippage.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:52:27
Because you can buy back more?  If he sold at 7500 and its 6500 you can buy back 15% more than you sold, or you can buy back the same amount and keep that 15% difference.
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:53:16
What wallet/app is that showing your old transactions in current conversion rates?  I would get really bummed out too seeing that, but if it just showed me the BTC amount or the historical dollar amount I probably wouldn't notice it as much.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:30:40
I have been tracking just my GDAX trading as part of an experiment and I am averaging about 1% per day (compounding) so about 35-36% per month.
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:57:36
All 3 of the ones GDAX offers but usually only to USD.  I don't do much trading from one coin to another.

I actually got my new uninterruptible UPS power supply delivered yesterday by the United UPS Parcel Service.

Aaaand... its gone.

For traditional finance maybe, but from the other crypto funds I've seen the typical management fee is anywhere from 1.5-3%.
I'm guessing they charge alot more because its much more niche and the process to hold and secure the coins is much more in-depth compared to traditional finance.
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:56:46
I'm sure this guy is smart but damn he needs to work on his public speaking. It makes it hard to follow when he is going "um uh and um" every 3 words.
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:13:47
If you did this wouldn't you incur additional taxes from capital gains on the bitcoin itself?  If that is the case it makes it even worse than paying with fiat currency.
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:34:30
That seems like a steal to me.  Whenever I looked at used cars an equivalent model of Honda/Toyota was always like $2500-5000 more than a domestic counterpart assuming similar condition and mileage.
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:34:27
Wouldn't that mean I end up paying a much larger fee when I go to withdraw due to the multiple inputs?  Like if I did $50 a week for 10 weeks and withdrew the $500 wouldn't that mean there are 10 inputs vs 1 input if it was a larger single sum?
Also how would exchanges be profiting off network transfer fees?  I thought the only fee an exchange takes is the 0.25% broker fee on trades and the miners would get all of the transfer fee when you go to withdraw.
@_date: 2017-10-11 06:47:22
Yeah I am more referring to user control of fees in general whether it be a wallet, exchange, or whatever else.  Wallets are getting better with some offering custom fee settings but many still have no option.
I don't see why these exchanges couldn't just set it up where when you go to buy a coin there is an option either deposit at a specific address or create wallet for me on their platform and deposit.  Nobody wants to keep their coins on the exchanges and as far as I know they gain no benefit from the transaction fee which goes to the miners.
@_date: 2017-10-15 08:36:06
Does your tracker account for fees? Most I've used don't factor in fees and it ends up skewing my profits/losses.
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:40:11
Right I know there are some wallets out there with the ability to set specific fees but that only helps you if you already have the coins in that wallet.  How do you get them to that wallet with low fees?  Is there a way to purchase BTC directly to your wallet address?  If I have BTC from an exchange or Coinbase that I want to get to that wallet I have no option to set my fees transferring from those places.
@_date: 2017-10-11 03:30:14
I would say I am more concerned with fees outside the wallet since any coins I have on a wallet are likely there for long-term storage rather than constant transactions.  I'd still like to see more fee control options on wallets but where I would really like to see improvements is on exchanges and sites where you buy BTC.
For example I wanted to take advantage of the low altcoin prices but the only BTC I have is on a paper wallet so I bought $200 in BTC from Coinbase today.  I got charged their $8 fee for the transaction which I totally understand.  I took half of that and sent it to Bittrex to change into alts, and was charged another ~$2 fee that (around 180 satoshi/byte) which was on the higher end at the time according to  The recommended "best" fee was around 130-140 for the quickest confirmation time.  Kind of annoying to pay an extra 50 sat/byte but I didn't mind too much since I really wanted the BTC on Bittrex ASAP as the alt prices were already starting to rebound.  The part that I found most annoying was taking that other $100 and sending it to my wallet which of course also used that same 180 sat/byte fee and I basically spent another $2 for nothing.  I didn't need that to go through right away and would have rather paid like 1-10 sat even if it took a day+.
Like I said though I am probably just stupid and doing things inefficiently.  If there exists a way to buy BTC and have it deposited directly into your wallet or exchange of your choice let me know so I don't make the same mistake in the future.
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:25:57
I don't know about that used Honda's/Toyota's don't really get that cheap since they have a reputation of lasting forever.  I've seen used Toyota's with over 400k miles for almost 9k.
@_date: 2017-10-11 08:43:18
Ah that makes more sense now.  I figured they easily had the ability to let us set our own fees but instead they reserved that ability for themselves to set high fees and profit the difference.  Can't really say I am surprised.
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:40:49
I'd rather have the positive coverage. Crypto is already full of dissidents and that is the primary demographic. Those people are also all capable of finding crypto on their own. If the goal is to increase adoption we need to reach out to all the "normie" demographics.
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:58:59
Social change comes slowly over time. I don't see crypto overthrowing fiat currency or traditional banking anytime in our lifetimes, but that doesn't make it useless. It still doesn't work well for smaller purchases, but there are situations where it would be preferable to traditional methods. Increasing adoption now as a supplementary currency to fiat would make it less of a hassle to use now and maybe accelerate the rate before it does become a standard currency.
All I know is that if things like credit cards weren't embraced years ago and everyone thought they were a pain in the ass to use they probably wouldn't be around today.
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:22:17
Yeah but I am just pointing out that there is still a negative bias against it in almost every time it appears in some movie or TV show. It further suppresses new people from getting in because of the negative stigma.
Sure there are also plenty of times where you see drug dealers with giant piles of cash but unfortunately you have to use money in your daily life unless you want to find ways to barter with people using livestock or grain. Crypto is optional to use, and if it keeps getting portrayed in the media like it has been people will keep resisting to use it.
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:45:40
They still don't paint crypto in a positive light though. As you pointed out the shows pointed out that it's highly volatile and used in illicit activities to break the law.
