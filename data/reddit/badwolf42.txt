All totally fair. The party in power usually has a disadvantage going into at very least the midterms though. Firm support seems to be sitting in and around 30% right now, so if nothing changes; I'm not sure we'll see a round 2.

That’s just it. I’m not sure it matters who the dems put up.

That seems objectively unlikely. He didn't win the popular vote (I know, I know, blah blah, but it's true) the first time around. Just because of the way power swings back and forth; I think you'll see enough opposition turnout in 2020 to replace him.   
Please feel free to set a reminder of this comment for 2020 around election season. It's nothing to do with Trump personally either. It's just the numbers and historical trends don't seem to support re-election at this time. I'm guessing you'll have a visceral reaction to this comment, but remember how many people viscerally believed that Hillary was a sure thing.

Give it another go. It defaulted to one day and I really do want to revisit this in 2020.

Nor could they post about not wanting to to pay taxes if tax money hadn't been spent creating the Internet.

Wow! Such kill!

It should be taxed like any other currency exchange.
In the US, that means any gain over $200 is subject to capital gains tax.
If we want it to be seen as a currency, we have to treat it like a currency.
I'm not going to go into the practical side of reporting gains, only the legal obligation that applies to any other currency.

I read it as sarcasm because the alternative is an unimaginable failure of logic and empathy.

Nope, it was about agent-wonderbread's comment.

I see it more like banning seat belts because someone fused one shut and sunk the car to kill someone somewhere.
The vast majority of seat belt use saves lives, but that one scenario just scared someone so much they wanted to ban them.

True, because the money in your wallet doesn't lose value during the process on the right side of the decimal.

Alright, so that's neat! I wasn't sure how that would impact the existing block chain. While I'm only a hobby level coder, I may still be able to understand the explanation.
That said, the usable denomination could just shrink then, making it equivalent to inflation but on the other side of the decimal. Yes?
