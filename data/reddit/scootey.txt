TigerDirect uses the irreversible nature of Bitcoin transactions as an excuse for them to only refund you in TD gift cards if your order is returned or cancelled. See [this page]( on TigerDirect's website:


They can refund you if you pay with a credit card, though. Of course, your credit card transaction is not "reversed" as in them removing the transaction from the record. Rather, they refund the funds back to your card in a new transaction. I see no reason that TigerDirect can't do the same for Bitcoin; their Bitcoin payment processor supports that functionality if I recall.
Don't do business with companies that use the irreversible nature of Bitcoin as an excuse for shit like this. Shame on TigerDirect.

I wouldn't ordinarily advocate for this kind of thing, but everyone should go google for "blockchain" and click that ad. These ads are still appearing, and they go to a fraudulent blockchain login/phishing page, the one containing "richard" in the URL. Of course, do not enter (real) login details into the form.
If it gets enough clicks, you may be able to exhaust their Google AdWords budget for that keyword/day and stop these ads from being displayed. Sure Google might be alerted to the abnormal number of clicks for this, but if this is drawn to their attention they'd most likely find out it's a phishing site. They might not want campaigns to get people to click certain ads, but I would think that the ad being for a phishing site would trump that rule.
I also recall a site that would repeatedly load images from scam/phishing sites in an attempt to waste their bandwidth and put them offline. Not sure if it's still around though.

This is a dangerous statement to make. I say that not only because it may trick Linux users into a false sense of security. But with this post hitting the front page, it very well may have encouraged a malware developer to target Linux users and possibly exploit a less frequently tapped market.
Linux is not an unsafe OS to use, and typically is no less safe than Windows or OS X. But there is practically no such thing as a truly "safe" OS. Security holes can be exploited; while this may be a less common attack against Bitcoin users, you probably want to keep your system/network regularly updated and secured.
But the worse threat is social engineering, and generally untrusted binaries that some users may be tricked into running. Recently, a supposed archive of leaked MtGox data was actually malware which looked for wallet.dat and stole coins if unencrypted. There may be fake/malicious sites that claim to have Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency software, but have the user download a malicious executable. Some altcoin wallets themselves could potentially contain malware if released by an unscrupulous developer.
Security is more or less relative. No matter what OS you use, take security measures to protect yourself. Ensure you don't run untrustworthy executables, keep software up to date, and consider encrypting your wallet. Understand the potential risks of services that hold bitcoin, whether you are a consumer, business, or operator of one of these services.
A great example of this is demonstrated in a very well-known paper, [Reflections on Trusting Trust]( It's a relatively short read, and easy to understand if you know some basics of C programming and Linux/Unix. Basically: can you *completely* trust that the 'login' command on your system, or the compiler used to create it, or the compiler that compiled that compiler, or even microcode at the hardware level is not compromised? Especially with the increasing complexity and many levels of abstraction in computer architectures and software these days, there will always be some potential attack vector.

I can see it happening if the paper (or other medium) is destroyed somehow, it didn't work to begin with, or contents were sabotaged/broken into. A site like MtGox should have had safeguards to protect against these problems, but I can see how they may not have.
If your cold storage wallet is physically located in one building and it burns down, chances are your cold storage wallet is too (unless you had it engraved into some sort of fireproof material or something). You probably don't want to make too many copies of cold storage, but I can see how some redundancy is necessary as even safe deposit boxes can be destroyed (ie many were at the WTC on 9/11).
Or perhaps the authentication method they used made it inaccessible...maybe the party needed to authenticate it isn't willing to, or they used an inadequately strong method to begin with.

I don't know if there's any profit to be made off of MtGox's "technology" or dealing with the situation regarding monetary assets/liabilities. But I can imagine at least a few entrepreneurs would consider bidding on MtGox's trademarks, domains, and customer list. (At least so if the bankruptcy process in Japan works anything like it does in the US.)
Even if it's gotten mostly bad publicity, MtGox has better brand name recognition than almost any other Bitcoin exchange. The people who got screwed by MtGox probably won't be too eager to do business with them. But taking over and overhauling the MtGox brand could be profitable for a current or future cryptocurrency exchange, especially if they appealed to newer Bitcoin users who haven't been through this fiasco.
A lot of retailers that have failed in recent years have had their intellectual property bought out and have been "relaunched" as an online retailer.

All had their IP bought out by a third party at the end of liquidation and are now reincarnated as much smaller online retailers.

And the tone of it in general, too. For instance, look at the author's suggestion that Bitcoin will inevitably see an exponential rise in its use over the coming year and decade.

The cost of not throwing away the mining equipment is the clutter that it creates and the space it takes in one's dwelling (or wherever you store your mining rig). Think of items purchased with potential "future" collectible value. All of this stuff *could* be worth some resale value someday, but not everyone has storage space to leave it sitting around while they wait for their stuff to gain value.
Also consider that this is most likely outdated mining hardware that produces much more heat and consumes a lot more power per GH than modern mining hardware. From how bulky it is alone (for 200GH/s) as well of some of it being old BFL hardware, I can tell this is probably older/inefficient hardware.
If the value of BTC does go up (and almost certainly if it increased by a factor of 10), the difficulty will probably increase enough that it will still be a money-losing endeavor.

[BloomNation]( is a platform that is used by local florists to offer flower delivery online. There's an article that the Atlantic ran on this, [It Is Now Possible To Buy Tulips With Bitcoin](




I don't think this is so much something that the local florist is doing, but rather a payment option that BloomNation is offering customers regardless of the florist. These local florists that are fulfilling online orders paid with Bitcoin may not even be familiar with Bitcoin themselves. They may just accept it as an alternative payment option for customers, and a lot of the florists probably get paid out in fiat.

Of course though, one of the key promises that GAW made for PayCoin's "legacy payment" integration was a PayCoin debit card. This never came to fruition, and it appeared that they hadn't done the necessary R&amp;D and regulatory/legal work nor established the necessary business relationships to offer such a card. IMO, their card mockups also look even crappier than the [Hashbase debit card mockup]( that was used for Paycoin.

Don't let Paycoin pollute your perception of all altcoins, especially those that have brought actual innovation/user base to the cryptocurrency space. (Even though this is what Paycoin claims to do.) For instance, we shouldn't dismiss altcoins that introduce new crypto algorithms, or that deliver a working implementation of a much-desired feature. Other algorithms may address shortcomings of Bitcoin that arise in the near future or that have already arisen.
A couple of examples. The blockchain is probably much more massive than the developers may have originally envisioned, making it impractical for some users to run a Bitcoin-Qt client on their own system. And with BTC fees having increased, Bitcoin is impractical for some types of micropayments. There are altcoins that may be more suitable for these types of transactions, due in large part to their much lower transaction fee. And if vulnerabilities, scalability issues, or other problems are found in Bitcoin sometime in the future, devs might be looking to alternate algorithms to solve whatever problem they face.
I would agree that the majority of them out there are shitcoins, though. Many of them are merely forks of some other SHA256/Scrypt/X11/etc coin. They probably do very little development, and sometimes try to create forks of coins for every imaginable application of cryptocurrency that *we don't need a new coin for!* If you're introducing a new algorithm or features then that's one thing, but forking Litecoin and rebranding it as your own coin is generally useless.
Sometimes the "developer" promises some grand vision that will likely never materialize. It's often features like anonymization of payments that they never deliver on. They may expect someone else to do all the work for them, it may be some kind of scam solely for the purpose of enriching themselves, or the feature is implemented but deficient at best. For example, I see at least 6 coins with the word "dark" in them traded on Cryptsy: Darkcoin, BitcoinDark, LitecoinDark, Darkshibe, DarkCash, and DarkToken. How many of them have managed to successfully implement their promised functionality?

Yeah, I'm sure they are aware of GAWMiners' existence and operations, especially given the scale of the operation. But more complaints and providing more information about what various GAW/Paycoin customers have observed/experienced may help their investigation. I don't know if it's something that could backfire against a GAW customer filing the report, though. (There's a small chance that one could get a reward for providing useful information that assists in the prosecution of Garza and possibly others. But most likely, it'd be insiders and GAW "resellers" that may have valuable info.)
Although for all we know, they could be preparing an indictment for Josh Garza as we speak.

Has anyone thought about reporting GAW/Garza to the SEC or other agencies? I understand the cryptocurrency community might not like the prospect of regulation over unregistered securities and whatnot. But Garza and company have probably crossed the line into downright fraud, and I wouldn't be surprised if the SEC is actively in the process of investigating this operation already. My concern isn't about them dealing in unregulated "securities" (whether it's coins or mining shares); it's about them engaging in fraudulent business practices that have the potential to financially harm a lot of people.
Or is there any evidence that they have made any kind of attempt at the necessary regulatory filings for what they are seeking to do? One of the selling points of Paycoin is that it's advertised to integrate with legacy payment infrastructure. For instance, they advertise that there will be a Paycoin debit card, complete with pictures/renderings of a "mockup" card. But chances are that it is a far way off at best, and will likely never materialize. I think another component of this was the shopping gateway where they claimed to have agreements with major retailers. These are evidently just affiliate agreements (that are likely soon to be terminated), as almost anyone can get with Amazon or CJ.com.

[DOGE exchange on Cryptsy](
[XPY exchange on Cryptsy](
Dogecoin's price has stayed relatively stable (with minor fluctuations) compared to the rollercoaster of pump and dump cycles that Paycoin has seen. Paycoin's price is more or less in free fall, having plummeted ~40% (**edit:** make that ~50%) over the past 24 hours. I would say that's probably what they're getting at with respect to "hyperinflation".
Paycoin bills itself as "the people's money", and claims to be simultaneously backed by a substantial amount of fiat currency. But if the price of Bitcoin and even Dogecoin/Litecoin are remaining relatively stable while Paycoin loses nearly half its value in a day, that is a very bad sign. You are seriously better off investing in the Russian ruble, unless you're an ~~inmate~~ insider at GAW who knows when the next pump will be.

Are you familiar with the concept of [mandatory binding arbitration]( At least in the US, all kinds of contracts (for things like banking, employment, car sales, telecom service, even [Whataburger]( contain mandatory binding arbitration clauses that effectively waive your right to have a case against them heard in court. They instead have it handled by an arbitrator, who is typically chosen by the company.
Would you say that the government still has a monopoly over this when mandatory arbitration clauses are common in contracts nowadays? Usually if you don't want to sign the contract that includes the arbitration clause, they will refuse to do business with you. And I don't think you can typically say "no, I want to choose a different arbitrator" either. They'll just shut the door on you.
There is usually an asymmetric relationship between the two parties when one signs a contract with a mandatory binding arbitration clause. Could there be a way for the two parties to fairly select an arbitrator who has a (relatively) neutral stance on things? As of present, the company often has a conflict of interest with the arbitrators that they work with. The arbitrator has a vested interest in getting returning business from the company, and the company has a vested interest in winning the cases that undergo arbitration.

You also have to consider: what is your customer base like, and how likely are they to be familiar with Bitcoin? Are you selling bags to parents buying them for their (younger) kids, or are a lot of them being sold for young adults and college kids? I'd think the young adults are probably more likely to be willing to pay in Bitcoin than, say, parents would be. Perhaps offer some kind of discount to customers who pay in Bitcoin, as well?

I had the exact same experience with TigerDirect. Ordered something from TD, paid in BTC, and they cancelled the order. There was nothing else I wanted to buy from TigerDirect at that time, so I expected my money back.
They said they could only refund me in a TigerDirect gift card because "bitcoin transactions are non-reversible". As far as I'm aware, the payment infrastructure they use (BitPay) can handle refunds. Eventually I got them to refund the transaction back to my bitcoin address, but not without a lot of arguing with TD's customer service reps.
It seems like a shitty excuse to keep customers' money at TigerDirect when they pay in bitcoin. It's not that different than for credit card transactions. When you get a refund on a CC, your original transaction doesn't disappear; they refund your money in another transaction.
Either they are confused or lying about how their Bitcoin payment infrastructure works. There are other vendors that handle Bitcoin refunds in a much more graceful manner. TigerDirect is kind of a sketchy vendor to begin with (same for Rakuten aka Buy.com). So when dealing with bad vendors like them, I'd rather just stick with the consumer protections on my credit card.
**EDIT:** Oh yeah, I did sign up for the Google protection as well. When I contacted them regarding the refund issue, they said that bitcoin transactions were not covered under the program. Whatever vendor is telling you that your purchase with BTC is covered under the Google protection program is committing fraud.

That one by itself resembles a Ponzi scheme and makes the assumption that BTC value will increase, but there are various use cases for Bitcoin that don't.

My understanding is that most of the energy consumed by the components in a PC turns into heat so there shouldn't be a huge difference. But I'm not an engineer so I could be wrong. Anyone more informed on this?

Rapidshare makes you wait **5 minutes** just to start downloading a file? WTF? "The Anti-Waiting Company" my ass.

You'd be using your employer/institution's resources for personal gain. Even if the system has unused capacity, running a miner still consumes more power and costs them money. It's likely unethical (especially if it's a publicly funded institution), and you run the risk of losing your job or being kicked out of school. I wouldn't risk it.

The rate of growth of these new businesses doesn't even come close to the massive increase in BTC trade volume. (think linear/polynomial vs exponential growth.) So the increase in BTC's value probably isn't because people see it as valuable for trade on the Bitcoin economy, but rather because they see it as an investment to eventually cash out.

Do they really want to see Palo Alto, San Jose, and everywhere in between slowly decline into the next Detroit? Sure they might be acting in the interest of present-day 'tech' giants. But what happens when they're no longer so prominent, and today's emerging companies grow to dominate these industries? If they all decide to locate outside of California...then well, they might be kinda fucked.

As said in one of the subthreads, make sure you minimize the number of times you access the API. I'd pull the BTC-USD value every 1-20 minutes and cache it.
If your code pulls it every time you display a price, that could impact performance significantly and possibly exceed the API's request limit (especially if you show BTC price to all customers, not just as an option).

Is this a prototype, or an actual production model that they'll be shipping to people who are paying &gt;$20k? I can understand if he's just getting one of a limited initial run of these miners, especially since he supposedly works for or otherwise has connections with BFL. Perhaps they'll work out the kinks and ship a quality product in the end.
But some of this stuff is absolutely unacceptable for a product in this market/price range. For $20k, they should be shipping nothing short of an industrial/business-grade product. I mean seriously, consumer-grade eVGA/Thermaltake power supplies? I'd be reluctant to let one of those power a $2000 gaming PC, let alone a $20k mining machine. And there's the various build quality issues that are pointed out too. It needs to have at least the quality of a (relatively) high-end server that you'd buy for a fraction of what you pay for this thing.

Well, it's cheaper than what BitInstant charges for the same service, not to mention the issues with them lately. To get $50 to a Bitcoin account, fee is $2.08 BitInstant fee + $3.95 ZipZap fee = $6.03 total.
Sure, you can use other exchanges that charge far less in fees. MtGox+Dwolla takes a while to get cash into your account, not to mention the invasive AML procedures that both require. Plus they're kinda sketchy.
Coinbase is pretty nice. But they take nearly a week and you're locked into the BTC/USD exchange rate on the day you purchase the coins (not when you actually get them). This kinda sucks when the BTC price is declining.
Can you suggest where I can *easily*, *instantly*, and *reliably* buy $50 worth of Bitcoin for under $5 in fees? WU's services are usually instant, and they have tons of brick-and-mortar outlets to send or receive payments (plus online).

In practicality, this really isn't as silly as it might seem. Where can I easily buy $500 worth of bitcoins (using bank account, credit card, or cash) for under $10 in fees? (And that's not even including double fees to transfer to and from BTC)
Transferring through Dwolla to Mtgox might be lower in fees, but there can be substantial delays and AML requirements. Wire transfers are expensive and unfamiliar for many, at least in the US. Services like BitInstant are much easier and faster, but you'll be paying over $10 in fees. And in fact a lot of the payment locations are through WU's competitor MoneyGram.
If Bitcoin continues to take off, I'm sure this will change at some point (if not fairly soon). But for now, WU is far more accessible than most ways of obtaining bitcoins.
