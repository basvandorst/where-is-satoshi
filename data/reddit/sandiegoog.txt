&lt;insert any country here&gt; with 0% trading fees is rising in liquidity and bitcoin! no duh. a person in Kenya for example could create an exchange with a couple people and become top dog just by trading in between themselves if their fees were 0%, this means nothing.

 No, if you dont hold your keys theyre not your bitcoin. What if you were to get hacked? Coins gone. Coinbase gets hacked? your bitcoin are gone. i recommend a hard wallet for long term storage.


It could go to $1,000,000 or it could go to $0 no one knows. I recommend dollar cost averaging and never invest more than you are willing to lose like you would other investments. I put 10% of my paychecks into bitcoin and siince doing so ive profited over 1000% which i will be holding on to. compared to my "safe" stocks which im only up 28%

How do you set up your vending machines, call up a local business and ask if they want one and you give them a cut? I'm at work right now and two dudes are stocking the vending machines but I know they aren't the owners so I'm guessing the owner owns 100+ machines and pays people to stock.
