You need to deposit at least 0.35BTC in your account
@_date: 2015-06-05 18:19:33
I think this about sums it up 
@_date: 2014-01-21 10:23:15
Any chance you can reinstall the plugin so I will be able to check this issue out ?
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:56:02
Interesting feedback, I will definitely look into this.
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:45:47
Yes it scans. Already Checked it out.
@_date: 2014-01-20 16:43:19
Help me out here...I'm not a native speaker...
@_date: 2014-01-21 07:23:07
ooppps...thanks 
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:02:48
Hey, you should have 1 entry if you entered your email. You can email me at the contact page and I'll check it out for you. You don't have to refer friends to get your initial entry it's just if you want to get more entries.
@_date: 2014-01-20 15:46:33
You can follow me on twitter  I usually update there when I deploy something new.
@_date: 2014-01-13 12:55:31
What about just putting the app on BitStamp so each time you open it it will open on the same tab ?
@_date: 2014-01-21 22:24:21
I used a website called "powtoon" -   
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:49:43
I personally think it's much cooler and easier than to use a mobile app, but I guess everyone is entitled to their own opinion....
@_date: 2014-02-02 19:06:33
That's why it's a "simplified" version. For non technical people. The idea was to illustrate that in order to use your Bitcoin client (for example to spend Bitcoins) you will have to use your private key.
@_date: 2014-01-12 14:32:42
Yes it does. Will update it now
@_date: 2014-07-14 13:43:15
This is just plain slander. 
I own 99Bitcoins and yes we do accept payments for putting up articles but we never promise to give a good review, we write our own opinion and the buyer can get a full refund if he's not satisfied. 
You can read the stuff on the website and decide for yourself, the nerve people have to just write whatever they like without checking out the whole process or the decency to even put their real name behind it is amazing. Of course the link above is listed under an alias. At least at 99Bitcoins I give me real name and contact information....such duchebags..much asshole
@_date: 2014-01-21 07:24:22
Thanks for the detailed feedback. I am looking into this now, will keep you updated.
@_date: 2014-01-21 17:04:53
I thought about it, but then decided that it was best to keep it as simple as possible and just to explain the concept.
@_date: 2014-01-12 13:25:11
Thanks for the tip. Will start working on this right away...
@_date: 2014-01-20 15:45:55
Am adding it to the next version :)
@_date: 2014-07-14 16:47:06
Did you even take a look at the website before writing this stuff ? tried to read the articles ? take a look at the tutorials ?
"99bitcoins does not have an editorial policy stated anywhere on the site regarding pay to play style submissions." - The website has a disclaimer at the bottom saying that we may be affiliated with products we write about. 
It seems to me that your research amounted to sending out one email and nothing more, and the comments on this thread basically support this. I have not idea what's your play here since you are spamming this article all around twitter (as the comments here suggest as well) and clearly this is not a blog that you write on Medium since it has only 3 posts...
On the other hand my blog has been up for over 15 months  and I clearly state my personal information on every page - so what are you hiding ?
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:28:59
Why's that ? The calendar is filled with events...take a look again.
@_date: 2014-08-14 13:42:34
Yes these guys seem to know what they're doing. Not your average Nigerian prince...
@_date: 2014-10-02 13:50:43
Well if it's 0.7% a day which is what I'm currently making is sums up to quite a bit ROI monthly..
@_date: 2014-01-20 21:59:32
Thanks ! Appreciate the support..
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:46:59
I can get specific colours and designs. If you want the same but it black then no problem - just write it in the comments. If you want a totally different design than send me a link to an image and I'll try to see if I can get one.
@_date: 2014-01-21 07:28:05
Got it fixed
@_date: 2014-05-11 08:40:23
:) I should hire you as my editor
@_date: 2014-11-24 20:26:18
What misinformation did you find ? perhaps it can be fixed. And regrading the grammar I'm not a native English speaker, so if there's something specific you think should be changed feedback will be appreciated. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 11:11:44
Damn...that's my article. Why the hell did this guy put it in full caps ??
@_date: 2014-01-21 17:51:59
Sounds interesting, I thought about digging deeper into Bitcoin mining in the next one, but that's also an option I'll consider.
@_date: 2014-01-21 17:04:27
Thanks ! Will change it 
@_date: 2014-01-20 14:48:55
Not currently, but I'm working on a desktop version and a web version that isn't Wordpress related as well.
@_date: 2015-01-22 07:15:21
Can you perhaps explain what you mean by "done right" ? Also, If you'd read the article all the way through you see that it states clearly "There are some good legit companies out there.."
I assume from you comment that you've had some success in cloud mining - any specific mining company you'd recommend ?
The idiot author
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:47:08
Now your point is clearer, thanks. It still kind of bugs me that people call authors idiots and then say that they didn't even read the article.
@_date: 2014-05-10 15:30:31
You're correct. Fixing it now.
@_date: 2015-07-22 12:24:00
Do you remember which ones they were ?
@_date: 2015-07-10 14:32:18
Why? What's wrong with them
@_date: 2015-07-24 11:05:28
I give out examples and not the whole list. Same way as I didn't list out the list of all of the Bitcoin automated exchanges. I do supply however a link to find all of these exchange so the reader can choose which ever he wants.
@_date: 2015-07-10 12:10:55
TL;DR version:
Check Bittrust
Check Badbitcoin
Find Alexa rank
Check r/Bitcoin
Check Whois registration
Check Bitcoin foundation
Check Bitcointalk
Check about us / contact us page
Check domain authority / trust flow
Check Google
Common sense
@_date: 2015-07-01 15:09:05
Not sure what's your point. I haven't taken off the guide, just the banner on that specific page.
@_date: 2015-07-22 14:00:20
Thanks for the feedback! Looking into this now
@_date: 2015-07-10 15:44:40
Is there any reference to this so I can update my post ?
@_date: 2015-07-01 15:22:43
Good idea, I'll make sure to ad it. Thanks for the feedback
@_date: 2015-07-22 22:24:47
I'm actually going to add some new options soon now that Coin.MX just shut down. Just haven't gotten to it yet.
@_date: 2015-07-01 15:00:59
Point taken, I've removed the banner. Thanks for the feedback
@_date: 2015-07-01 15:01:46
Actually it gets asked almost 6000 times a month on Google, that's why I added it
@_date: 2015-07-23 12:23:33
@_date: 2015-07-22 21:12:40
Great idea, just looked it up. How do you add questions to it ?
@_date: 2015-07-22 21:12:19
Well if there's any chance you'd like to contribute from your own knowledge I'd appreciate it. The questions are ranked from the easiest to the hardest so perhaps you need to go a bit deeper into the quiz to get the more tough one.
@_date: 2015-07-01 15:15:47
Oh, so you're a hater, why didn't you say so. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 13:39:14
Correct. I just added a mobile friendly version (link on top of the page)
@_date: 2015-02-24 17:50:52
Thanks, my bad :)
@_date: 2015-02-03 13:43:04
You'e correct, thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-26 09:40:56
I'm pretty sure he said those things about Bitcoin though...
@_date: 2013-10-17 13:54:19
What about using [VirWox]( ? They have larger fees but perhaps on a large scale it could be done.
@_date: 2013-10-17 12:39:19
I am aware of the problem of withdrawing funds from Gox. But in my opinion even if I get this money in 4 months it will still be worth making the profit. It all comes down to if you believe Gox will come through in the end or not, and I believe they will
@_date: 2013-10-13 19:46:20
You're welcome :)
@_date: 2013-11-11 13:56:40
This is one of the coolest things I've seen lately. Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-10-17 12:52:44
Not much...but that's my personal opinion. What do you suppose ?
@_date: 2013-10-27 11:33:26
And to make it more authentic they even got the guy with the British accent...
@_date: 2013-10-17 13:05:22
@_date: 2013-10-14 04:08:41
Well....it probably should have stated "legally bizarre"...
