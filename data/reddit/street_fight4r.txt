They are paid to read about this shit all day, and they also need some karma, so they do these small contributions here and there just to be able to hit back in full force whenever a submission attracts lots of newcomers.
@_date: 2015-08-24 12:24:21


Sounds like something they will be able to say about Bitcoin, after we failed to agree to removing the temporary block size limit.
@_date: 2015-08-15 19:56:38
Yes it is. It is users, miners, big Bitcoin companies (exchanges, payment processors), node operators, etc. Even if it wasn't democratic, everyone is together on this particular change. I don't know what makes you think it isn't. The only people against this are a few reddit accounts (ie. fewer than 10), and a few Core devs.
@_date: 2015-08-30 00:28:16
What difference did the legalization make? Propaganda was already there anyway.
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:58:37
Because you don't like it? That's not reason enough, sorry. And I'm sorry that you don't like the fact that the economic majority (not you) rules Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:37:59
It has always had that right, XT changes nothing in this regard.
Anyone can fork Bitcoin, and people will choose which chain to follow. That's the gift Satoshi gave us. The Core devs are not representing us anymore, so we are forking it without their permission. Bitcoin is working as intended.
@_date: 2015-08-15 20:10:13
Nah man, his contributions to Bitcoin have been great, and I don't think his intentions are bad, even knowing that he can profit from this. Let's not bash the guy, just peacefully disagree and start using a client that follows more accurately the plan Satoshi had for Bitcoin. This freedom to choose is how Bitcoin is supposed to work, the majority has the power and can vote by using different software.

Mining will always be profitable for someone. That's what the automatic difficulty adjustment is for.
@_date: 2015-08-15 18:43:52
I'd say it has a great chance. But these things don't need to happen overnight. Like someone explained in other comment, the idea is that miners and node operators start using this software over time, and then in 2016, if there is 75%+ hashing power voting (in the blockchain) for bigger blocks, the fork happens.
@_date: 2015-08-17 00:36:23


[citation needed]
In fact, it's quite the opposite. Almost everyone wants bigger blocks. The only people against it are a few reddit accounts, and the Core devs. Miners, merchants, and most users, are for the increase.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:30:17


So all it takes to paralyze Bitcoin is 1 troll. Not smart.


The 75% is not of people, it's of hashing power. People will choose which nodes to run, which wallets to use, which merchants to buy from, etc. They have the power. 75% is just to make sure a good number of miners are on board.


I have no clue, but we are not trying to mimic the US legal system in any way. That would be stupid.
@_date: 2015-08-15 20:31:13
That's hilarious, lol.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:21:50
Maybe Theymos bought it with the coins we foolishly donated, just like he did with the bitcoin.it wiki which he bought from Karpeles.
@_date: 2015-08-15 18:54:24
The fork won't happen unless there is 75% hashing power voting (in the blockchain) in favour, so you don't need to worry about a thing.
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:52:42


This stupid argument needs to end. Of course it's a feature, but hasn't increasing the block size been difficult enough already? At what point will you accept it has been difficult enough? Seems like your answer is "never", just because you don't want big blocks.

And here's a tip for you: When someone suspects someone else has incentives (eg: financial incentives, like OP is saying) to go against him, maybe they do. Don't just call everything bad a "conspiracy theory", because by your logic no bad things can ever happen.

Ethereum is an altcoin/vapourware that promised to launch first quarter this year, took money from everyone, and delivered nothing.
XT is a different Bitcoin client (like Bitcoin Core), which introduces a rule that by 2016, if 75% of the hashing power (miners) votes in favour, the temporary 1mb block size limit will be removed as Satoshi intended. A few people with conflicts of interests are trying to attack this initiative, and are spreading FUD about it.

Everyone can download the new software and start using it long before the change kicks in, just like Satoshi told us to do it (after block xyz, the limit is increased or removed). That's what bitcoinxt is doing.

Proof of stake is bad for public blockchains, and doesn't make sense either for private blockchains anyway. Let's say one of the bank manages to get 51% of the stake. Does it get to do whatever it wants? Of course not, it's a permissioned blockchain. You can only do what you are allowed to do. Just use a database and you will get a far better result, as it won't have any unnecessary overhead. The whole point of using a blockchain is being able to come to consensus with people you don't trust.
