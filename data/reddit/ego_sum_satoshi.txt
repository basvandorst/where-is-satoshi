Coinbase is an exchange. Not a wallet. They hold the private keys to your coins. Get a real wallet and send your coins off the exchange.

Sadly people dont learn this at a young age. It's always worth repeating.

They should be able to assign more.
Also, with flat rate electric you should consider mining some coins.

It's a chart of all the buy orders on the left and sell orders orders on the right. Where they meet in the middle is the current price of a bitcoin. It's a way to visualize the demand.

I only use my bitcoin to buy more bitcoin. Lol

Make sure you open port 8333.
I have two full nodes. One at home and one at my office.

Except bitcoin doesn't have days like the stock market. You can 24/7/365 forever trade bitcoin.

Trezor is open source. Anyone can audit the code or even build one themselves. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:33:14
That would obscure the trail if done correctly.

I have the update.  It looks good. I wish it had GDAX support, or a separate GDAX app.

I could figure out the cost exactly but its so small.  It's like $4 per year to run the laptop 24/7.

Thanks for supporting the network. I have two 15.0 nodes running right now, one at home and another at my office.
Did you forward port 8333 and check your status on  ?

One, two, three, four, FIFTH!

The market for bitcoin never closes. There is no day trading. You would be 24/7 trading. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:03:07
Basically yes. Addresses have no owners. You could give your private keys (or seed words) to someone, they could be stolen, or simply lost forever. 
There are only recorded transactions on the block chain, and many of those transactions have associations with identities.

One at home and one at work. You're right, I would need a new static IP for each node. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:43:07
Get a hardware wallet. I like Trezor.

Chain analysis works by tracking the movement of coins on the blockchain back to a known owner. For example, let's say you purchase on coinbase, they have KYC rules and have verified your identity. You send from coinbase to your wallet, that links you to the new random address. However,  nobody knows if you control that address, but they know you something about the transaction. If that address sends to a dark web dealer, and the authorities capture it, they can trace it back to the coinbase transaction, and coinbase could be forced to reveal your identity.
Bitcoin is not private, the entire blockchain is public data, and all exchanges are essentially banks that are required to verify identies of customers. There might be a way to get anonymous coins freshly mined from a pool or a p2p transaction but it would be a hassle. 
Check out Zcash or Monero for more privacy.

Paper wallets are often recommended on here. I never tried one.

I literally lol'ed too. She bought it a long time ago and it's been sitting in a closet for awhile. I love finding old PCs that run like shit with Windows and bringing them back to life with Linux and ram upgrades.

You really don't "get" new coins from a fork. You control a private key that is valid on both chains. 
This is why replay protection is important.
Also, if your coins are on an exchange they control the private key and "owe" you a certain amount of crypto. They can decide how to handle forked chains and maybe not give you both coins.

@_date: 2017-10-08 15:44:06
Correct, nobody knows who controls the private key. But, if authorities have a reason to trace a transaction, they will try to find anyone they can and pull them in for questioning. 
If you purchase on coinbase and send to Sally, and Sally tries to buy crack online from an undercover agent. They could follow the coin trail back to you via coinbase. Then you will have to rat out Sally or take the heat.

Right, zero cost because I found the old laptop in the closet. I didn't spend any fiat or crypto to get it all setup.
