That's why I don't do Probable Price ranges for fractions of currencies. The Millibit, as a fraction of a Bitcoin, should trade in a similar fashion to a fraction of an ounce of silver or gold. That is to say, they are fractions of a whole unit, not something distinct from the primary trading unit.

That’s correct. The probable price range is based in part on square root of price and the volatility. Since Bitcoin is very volatile, the probable price range is wider. If the volatility were less, then that would likely reduce the range.
If you watch the Bitcoin Probable Price Range over time you’ll notice it will capture the reversals at the high or low end of the range. This is exactly as it is designed to do.
Using a probable price range allows you to more accurately see the trend and know where support and resistance levels are. Yes, it is wide. I’ll likely try and create an alternate range that will be hopefully more narrow - but understand the range is based on a mathematical formula so it will be as wide or narrow as the price and price action dictate.
There are currently over 29 of these ranges for different markets, currencies and commodities, etc. so it will take some time before an additional probable price range is created and tested for Bitcoin.

The range is based, in part, on the square root of price. Larger numbers will have larger probable price ranges, but smaller numbers move a greater percentage of their price. The probable price range also adjusts based on volatility. Since the Bitcoin price tends to be volatile, the range is wide. If the volatility is reduced then the range would be more narrow. If you watch the Probable price range for a longer period of time you should see it brackets high and low price nicely and price will tend to turn at the high and low boundaries of the range - just as it is designed to do.

Yes, I used to do some Bitcoin arbitrage years ago. Coinbase is a sufficiently large exchange and their price data is produce on a reliable and consistent basis. Even though there is no actual “close” of a 24/7 exchange - my method does use and keeps record of closing price. I can get Coinbase data which utilizes a daily “close” which is part of why Coinbase prices were chosen.

There’s quite a bit more than meets the eye. This has several elements, including but not limited to: 1) Murrey Math; 2) Square roots and their relationship to price movements; 3) A self-adjusting mechanisms that takes into account how wide daily price movements are (volatility). There’s much more involved, but that’s a tiny slice of it. The template then allows you to analyze it against cycles which is what told me price would reverse near 5000.
It takes a fair number of lines of Python to do the calculations.

It’s a really old non-default that hasn’t been updated in years. You get 1/2 point.
