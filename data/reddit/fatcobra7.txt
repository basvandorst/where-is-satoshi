Very few people know who Trump really is and what he's actually about. We're all in the process of finding out. There are more than a few reasons to believe that what he says and tweets are often calculated to elicit a response from his opponents. Not necessarily what he'll do.

Why are a majority of comments here pretty similar and critical of FUD and referencing a coordinated attack - however everything is vastly downvoted? 
I've never seen a thread like this. Most people seem to be in agreement - yet they're all getting downvoted. Whose doing the downvoting?

This is pure doublespeak on your part. I see it all the time in this sub. The fact that something is resisting change means that it's actually changing more according to you guys. Give me a break. It is not an unusual situation.. When something resists change then it resists change. Period. Irrespective of the outside environment and what it's doing. The surrounding circumstances are always fluid.

Isn't the fact that were talking about it and making a big deal about it evidence that it can effect our sentiments with regards to these two instruments?

What do you mean by that? This is irrelevant?

Maybe you're right.. I just don't see how it's much different than gold to silver price or gold to dollar. Lots of Bitcoin people watch gold. Doubt it would effect the price of gold much, but it really seems like it can influence the price of Bitcoin. Possibly acting as a point of resistance.

Nice concern trolling. Go join your altcoin utopia.

If they believe it has a greater potential to disrupt the USD and/or American financial influence than it does their own - might that not influence them into adopting a more laissez-faire approach? Especially seeing that much of the infrastructure is held within their borders.

I believe Joe rogan said on a recent episode that he matched bitcoin donations to him from past episodes and sent to this project. Maybe it's him

Maybe see it as an opportunity to consider that the situation isn't as clear cut and black and white as you may have thought?

Joe Rogan got me into Andreas. Now my kettle bells have Bitcoin symbols on them.

No problem. Just saying that the currency (bills) will be backed by crypto currency ( Bitcoin) like US currency used to be backed by gold. The gold just had to be there in a vault somewhere at some proportion to the currency supply. So the transaction cost of Bitcoin and the ease of moving gold are irrelevant.
They could still engage in fuckery by printing disproportionally large amounts of currency relative to the gold or Bitcoin. But in theory there is at least something tying the currency to reality (scarcity). In the current system they don't even have to lie or cheat. Neverending printing is a feature.

When the US dollar was backed by gold, you could plop a $20 bill down at the grocery store without a piece of physical gold having to be carried from one room into another.

I wasn't one of the downvoters, but maybe they don't want to support illegal economic migrants? It's definitely debatable whether this is even a worthwhile cause. 
I mean this isn't "donate bitcoin to give water to a refugee child dying of thirst". It's asking us to donate money for cell phones for people who are arguably already getting financial benefits that they shouldn't qualify for. At the expense of Europeans being forced to contribute to all of this.

I learned about bitcoin on Joe's podcast.
@_date: 2016-07-17 11:26:47
I see your point, but Joe doesn't tell people to buy bitcoin. He's just someone who has a great conversation about bitcoin with Andrea. It's just a platform to spread the idea. After hearing about it I spent weeks reading and watching videos about it.

You're right. I just picked up where I saw they were talking about it being a reserve
