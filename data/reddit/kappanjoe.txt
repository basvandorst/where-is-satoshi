Well I'm glad the officer took it seriously. It sounds like they'll do their best to help you through it. Good luck!

You should also send this to the recipients of the letter he sent if possible.

Whenever anybody asks me about bitcoin anymore, I'm just redirecting them to these videos.

In all seriousness you should have your friend file a police report. The police likely won't do anything about it, but you can at least have it on file so in a month and a half if the culprit actually does any of these things you'll have leverage to combat them. If these things started happening and your friend just conveniently happened to have this extortion letter lying around without having filed the police report when you first received it, it would certainly look suspicious. The report would also help with insurance if they went as far as damaging any property. It should only take like 10-15 minutes.

Fun game. A bit easier than Threes but I miss the fun sounds and also don't like that when I swipe up on my phone it'll sometimes scroll the page.

That's probably just a shitty University graphic artist's fault.

Differs for each vendor, and I can't speak for these guys, but Bitpay.com has a set up where you can accept bitcoin from customers, and they deposit it as fiat every night on business days. Seems very similar to squareup.com. IIRC Coinbase also has merchant functionality.

They had to let it confirm 200 times.

I'm trying to learn more about the economics surrounding bitcoin. Why would this comparison be invalid?

That's not wind, it's just shiny...
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:53:51
That's a very good question... I would say probably not, they most likely have it reserved because you already sent them the money... but I could be completely wrong.

As a 6'4" guy who bonked my head on every train I ever rode on in Tokyo, no. The ceilings are *not* high.
