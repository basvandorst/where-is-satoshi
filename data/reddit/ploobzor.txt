LOL to quote the wise Chairman Jihan, "Leap your mother if you want to leap."
I don't believe this is racist. Racism is the belief that one race is superior to another. This piece of satire implies nothing about race.

Looks like Roger is either lying about buying Bitcoin Cash 2 weeks ago or lying about buying it yesterday. 
Exact part of the debate he said he bought bitcoin cash for the first time yesterday:

If you haven't listened to Roger Ver, he wants to bring down governments. Can't do that if you're partying or relaxing at the beach.

If that happens, it's the end of cryptocurrencies. We will always wonder when current crypto will be cracked, and we will realise it will always be and is thus never safe.

First he said Bitcoin has high fees, and now he says it can be sent "basically for free".

Assuming he still has it, or hasn't died and passed it onto a bad actor. It's an unknown risk, don't pretend it isn't.

It does matter, because Satoshi controls a huge portion of the Bitcoin money supply. I hope those private keys are in the hands of someone with integrity, or better, no one's hands at all.

lol me too ;)

Incorrect. He's on the record saying he bought Dash (see interviews he gave in 2016). He has said nothing about selling Bitcoin.

LOL only the last 144 blocks... doesn't mean much. For SegWit to lock in, there needs to be 95% of blocks signalling over a 2016 block activation period. Looks like it will be locked in at the end of the next period (block  which is 10th August. Then activation will be in the following period **23rd August.**

I know he bought a lot of dash a year ago, so he's still loaded.

I have deleted my original comment. It was ignorant.

Standard anti-Fed rhetoric. We should all be smarted than this.

It says you need to have a mtgox account to spend bitcoins?
