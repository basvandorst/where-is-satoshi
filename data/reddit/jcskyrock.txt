I know a lot of folks here take the piss out of these sort of questions. But I always read all the comments and enjoy the theories, jokes and gifs.

@_date: 2014-10-13 17:45:35
Great! Time to fight back!
@_date: 2014-05-30 12:29:17
Bugger, was about to buy in some more.
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:16:39
No exchange is 100% safe. Once you've purchased some, you'll want to research storage.
@_date: 2014-06-27 18:14:21
Nice, how many?
@_date: 2014-05-20 22:54:41
Been wondering this myself. News looks fairly uninteresting.
@_date: 2014-08-13 02:25:34
I guess I'm just impatient then.
@_date: 2014-05-30 12:26:27
Errr, what does this mean?
@_date: 2014-08-13 02:04:44
Yeah, that's what I'm getting at, I suppose. What is it specifically that we should primarily be focusing our efforts on?
@_date: 2014-06-27 18:13:35
@_date: 2014-05-20 22:58:05
Best way to learn is buy some. That's what I did. Once you own it, you immediately start devouring all Bitcoin threads.
I recommend Bitstamp.net.
@_date: 2014-09-19 23:34:37
Yep, I did mean public. Thanks, figured the answer would be a no. Some interesting responses. I feel I learned something today.
@_date: 2014-05-30 12:30:14
Perhaps, my OS X Bitcoin price ticker hammered the Bitstamp API too much.
@_date: 2014-08-13 02:03:02
Seems to be plenty of options for exchange available already.
@_date: 2014-06-28 02:30:29
Thanks, man. I bought about 10k and will sink the rest in soon.
@_date: 2014-10-09 15:59:03
I like the theory, because everything else about Bitcoin is super positive. I am a newbie though, so still learning a lot. But from what I've read the Bearwhale's strategy was to panic the market and make money buy buying cheap coins. That appears to have worked, so I assume they will try it again.
@_date: 2014-06-27 18:27:43
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:11:12
Right, clearly not a media driven increase, but you'd think they would still want to comment on it.
@_date: 2014-05-31 23:30:16
@_date: 2014-10-13 20:41:51
@_date: 2014-06-27 18:13:25
Obviously, I'm looking for opinions (usually abundant on here) as opposed to soothsaying.
@_date: 2014-05-30 12:43:21
I don't suppose you have their support email address? Or phone number?
@_date: 2014-10-09 22:29:56
Great speaker!
@_date: 2014-05-24 23:10:54
I'm in the process of wiring $50k to Bitstamp, should I cancel it?
@_date: 2014-06-28 02:30:16
Good to know.
@_date: 2014-05-31 23:23:32
Bit later than yesterday, but there is a little bump up to 628 happening now.
@_date: 2014-05-25 20:57:34
Is Coinbase transparent and regularly professionally audited?
@_date: 2014-06-27 18:17:24
I like that idea a lot and Bitstamp's limited order function makes it fun. Like fishing. Did something similar on the our first round. Will be interesting to see what happens over the next 40 days. Been a great ride so far.
@_date: 2014-08-13 14:35:17
Amen, brother.
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:02:01
What is a bear whale, is there a definition out there?
@_date: 2014-07-27 12:02:34
Surprised it's free. Weirdly, I would prefer a charge for a service like this.
@_date: 2014-08-13 02:06:15
Can't you? Maybe more BTC should be spent on promoting Bitcoin to accelerate adoption.
@_date: 2014-06-27 18:43:06
Another good option, thanks.
@_date: 2014-05-30 20:14:52
Thanks for fixing!
@_date: 2014-08-13 00:36:39
I wish this point of view was more mainstream also.

@_date: 2014-06-01 10:18:04
I'm a newcomer, was interested to read this and immediately understood the relevance to Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-05-30 11:03:41
Haha, indeed.
@_date: 2014-05-25 21:00:23
Was being rhetorical; because from what you have said, the answer would be: yes.
@_date: 2014-05-28 23:04:25
@_date: 2014-10-16 01:17:27
Do I detect a hint of sarcasm on this thread?
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:18:36
Oh and, I think Bitstamp is incorporated in the UK. Although you have to wire funds to Slovenia.
@_date: 2014-05-30 12:50:50
Ah, info found on a cached version of About page: 
@_date: 2014-08-13 00:17:33
In summary: ease. You make a good point.
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:20:02
Hmmm, but: 
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:28:29
And again at 300 -&gt; 220
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:25:33
Are you both still an item then?
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:26:32
On offline machines on little pieces of paper printed by a Heidelberg press.
@_date: 2014-09-19 23:24:15
Thanks, that makes me feel better.

I think the fee on the first transaction was .0002712… How do I see if it's been paid?
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:56:16
How right you are
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:18:22
Hmmm… I must've of missed the "next day delivery" option in the Blockchain.info Bitstamp dance. I guess I'm paying for standard delivery.
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:52:10
Ahah, I should look more closely at those advanced features. Meantime, my Bitcoin has arrived at Bitstamp. Worked great. Just over an hour. But because I'm sweeping, I guess that results in multiple transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:25:11
Hope works for me

Which bank are you using?
@_date: 2016-12-07 12:27:20
Any day now, lol.
@_date: 2016-12-17 18:03:35
Agreed - I didn't do it in the end..
@_date: 2016-12-07 12:26:46
I was thinking it looks like a good investment...
@_date: 2015-07-12 11:14:28
Does that include paper wallets created by Piper (  )?
@_date: 2017-04-03 21:54:30
And we're back!
@_date: 2017-05-01 13:06:37
I like this theory
@_date: 2017-05-01 13:06:02
Buy more
@_date: 2015-03-05 02:07:50
Ah, ok.
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:37:56
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:03:51
Double down
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:25:04
Oh, ok, thanks
@_date: 2016-07-06 22:30:29
Agreed
