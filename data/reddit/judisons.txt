They (2 ppl, same jo,  same company) should be paid the amount that was negotiated with each, if they have "drastically different wages" probably one asked way less than he could.
Normally the employer will pay around the smallest value the employee accepts, if its reasonably less than he can "produce" for the company.

The cheaper the energy more hashrate there will be, look if with the same money I run a s9 asic miner I can run a thousand s9's why miners would stop at one?

LN became a thing... a LOT of new "bitcoin accepted" signs... just to name two.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:58:35
FYI its not a 0-sum game.

at the same time the block creation reward in going down, the few satoshis you pay for each tx is increasing its value... without a second layer solution this can lead to very expensive txs as adoption grows... but we'll be using LN for our daily cup of coffee pretty soon.. not a real problem, tx cost (in sat/b) will keep around the same I think, maybe even less as with LN there's not much hurry... Miners will be able to pay electric bills and cash a lot with tx fees alone.

we allow socialist ppl here?

My question was about being aware or "its just the americanos" / "lets vote in the better guy next time"...
nice to see a bad situation at least makes the ppl more aware of important stuff, here (brazil) ppl just go for "we choose better next time"

Shitcoin? sure...
Solve some ppl problem? sure
Will be widely used? I belive it will.
How its good for bitcoin?
Ppl will use and understand it, they will quickly adjust the UI/UX in ways we would take years to achieve, but few months to copy.. its our vay to mass adoption.

Do you think government control of money is bad? (I mean, removing the "bad politicians" factor)
Do people in venezuela talk about those things?

will mixers be relevant with wider adoption of LN?? are LN transactions traceable?
@_date: 2019-05-15 06:30:51
I will for sure...  Why? I live in brazil, here when you pay something outside your country (eg. via credit card) you have to pay an extra 6.5ish % to the gov, besides the bank spread converting local currency to usd....
It will be, probably way cheaper (in this case) paying with btc,

@_date: 2019-05-15 15:07:49
Yep, the crossed finger method...
dont ever get stuff sent by dhl, ups etc, they always collect the gov theft, I mean, taxes...
Better to wait more time in a (even better untracked) unsuspected package
@_date: 2019-05-16 00:52:21
taxes dont belong in a civilized world.
