Speculation is investing in stocks with hopes of gains but risk of loss. From my research I determined risk was sufficiently low for me to invest. In fact, there was not much risk. 
As for the other connotation of "speculating", it's forming of a theory or conjecture without firm evidence. This definetly doesn't apply  because I understood the evidence and it was firm. 
Either way, as I originally stated, if he understood the technology and risk... He was not gambling. It was a calculated decision.

You're right, there no such thing as a sure thing. I could look both ways before cross the street and still get hit by a meteor.
What I'm saying is that you can get to the point where risk is quite manageable.

I think Bitcoin has more room to grow, too. 
I can tell you don't own a Tesla. Otherwise your opinion would differ.  It's the best car I existence.

There is always risks, but some risks are less than others. For example, after doing extensive research 7 years ago I found gas was going to be replaced by renewable energy such as solar and wind. I thought what industry would benefit... electric cars!
I bought into Tesla at $25/share. It was viewed stupidly risky by most. That's because they lacked the understanidng I had. 
I expect TSLA will make me a million within a decade. As I expect Bitcoin will, too.
