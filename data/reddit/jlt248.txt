some ppl dont want to use segwit so how can you trade segwit coins with regular coins, you cant! there would be two different books
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:02:19
They don't want it to fail. The fed needs BTC; it requires a commodity that doesn't cost anything to store and has an unlimited upside. Where do you think all the inflation money is going? They need btc! It can be broken down into 100 million pieces to be traded for value, that's huge
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:23:51
exactly! its funny how ppl wanna bitch about bitcoin cash, its either they sold theres for $300 or they never had any.. fucking broke people!
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:14:34
so if they did let him off, do you think he could sue and get his coins back. Obviously the Gov would have to pony up some new ones if that was the case.... That would be quite the buying spree to replace all those coins.

Here It Comes: New York Fed President Says "If Economy Weakens Further, Would Consider Negative Rates"
Tyler Durden's pictureSubmitted by Tyler Durden on 01/15/2016 09:43 -0500
 
 
 
Remember when the Fed's dots - less than a month ago - suggested there would be 4 rate hikes in 2016? Ah, the memories. Well, you can not only forget that (now that the market is estimating the next rate hike will come in October if ever), but it appears that the Fed will follow Kocherlakota's advice after all and not only cut rates (the possibility of a January rate cut now is 10%), but will pass go, and collect negative rates:
DUDLEY: IF ECONOMY WEAKENED, WOULD CONSIDER NEGATIVE RATES
After today's atrocious, recessionary data, one can be certain that the Fed is furiously considering negative rates.

True but u need enough bitcoin to cover all the transactions in the channels u have open, basically u connect to a master node of someone with 1000 btc. Basically a bank, then those ppl are connect to big biz, that accept ur payment through the master node/bank. Wake up ppl
@_date: 2017-03-23 00:05:51

honestly I would expect the next ETF to be approved due to the negativity ppl will now have and the fact it is insured.

me to
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:46:44
don't forget its a fork, with the same protocol, so both chains can be mined at once, meaning you will still never get the segwit implemented.
@_date: 2017-03-04 10:13:44

let me guess, you borrowed to buy?
@_date: 2017-03-22 01:26:06
He is right about the noise, the best time to buy is when everyone is freaking out. To include the ppl that think they have it going on.
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:55:14
thats just dumb, who said its going to go down
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:19:43

@_date: 2017-03-23 00:04:06
but why?
@_date: 2017-03-24 00:35:07
Bigger blocks lower fees, not sure how miners want more fees
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:04:24
im sure the guy that made this has less then 1 btc, the loudest ppl have no money
@_date: 2017-03-29 23:42:00

nope, dont plan on selling, just know it wont be approved
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:31:55
ppl that lost it all will come back to mine the original chain

buy the dips and sell the rips, the Capitalism run its course. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:26:21
its the same old story over and over again, coinbase is not a trading site, GDAX is. if you wanna be able to take an opportunity of price movement use GDAX. Coinbase is for retail purchases. You are buying and selling from them, not other sellers or buyers. So quit complaining
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:14:56

not yet because there is no BU chain

Other way around
@_date: 2017-03-22 01:28:37
I think i would have went with the Sell on GDAX and waited to buy again, but its time to buy right now! The upcoming ETF will be approved! This is the reason for the fear, smart ppl are accumulating.

good choice, I'm not sure though why if you wanna give an opinion that is not popular ppl shit on you, I was just giving an honest opinion. the market will always go the opposite of the 99%, that doesn't always mean price, could mean decisions like the ETF, it was to advertised and to much looking like it was in the bag.

Well maybe nobody owning bitcoins wants Hip book bags? Just because you accept payment for something doesnt mean they are willing to buy with it. If you only accepted bitcoin then that would force someone to use it, but only if your book bags were too cool to go without!

If implemented, SegWit would change this for the worse. It opens the door to an economic incentive model that would encourage mining cartels to form. As the bitcoin network currently operates, there is no incentive for miners to form cartels. Mining pools are not cartels; they are a firm. But SegWit introduces a fundamental change to bitcoin: the “AnyOneCanSpend address”, or essentially a blank signature for transactions. SegWit uses an “AnyOneCanSpend” address so that transactions will be validated and recorded into blocks, even though the sender/receiver signature data is separated. Normally, an “AnyOneCanSpend” output (as its name implies) would allow any miner to spend the funds associated with that transaction; therefore, SegWit would introduce new rules for interpreting “AnyOneCanSpend”. This means that miners could not take advantage of that output address to inappropriately spend the funds associated with all SegWit transactions.
But with “AnyOneCanSpend” addressing, the system is only secure while all participants agree it is secure. Proponents of SegWit assume that once its protocol change is activated, all miners will agree to play nicely, never steal funds, and funds will be locked up safely. But the major flaw in their thinking is that it ignores economic incentives for nefarious miners to do the following after SegWit activates:
1. Form a cartel to take over the network
2. Switch off SegWit and revert back to the current bitcoin protocol
3. Take advantage of the “AnyoneCanSpend” address to instantly steal funds associated with all SegWit transactions in blocks they mined.
By using “AnyOneCanSpend” addressing, SegWit therefore opens the door to a corrupt miner mining a block to subvert transactions, and instead redirect them to the miner’s own address. The value of such an illicit attack would grow every day SegWit is used. Over time, the more people use bitcoin, the more SegWit transactions are added to the blockchain, and the more funds are locked up with SegWit aspects of bitcoin, the more valuable this form of cartel attack becomes. A defecting miner could access historical funds that have not been redirected from SegWit to a traditional bitcoin address. Hence, the longer a SegWit system runs, the more likely it is that a cartel will form to steal funds.
Under SegWit, miners are not likely to form a cartel to recover an individual double spent transaction – even if it is a large single transaction. Rather, it is the sum of all SegWit transactions (at least in blocks mined by cartel members) which provides a large enough treasure chest worth pirating. If 51% of miners that signal for SegWit secretly support cartelisation of the protocol, it is only a matter of time before transactions are stolen. This could occur in the following way:
1. Miners signal SegWit.
2. A group of mining pools and companies with a joint hash rate in excess of 50% of the current network power form a cartel.
3. The cartel group then stops signaling SegWit and returns to the network to the former bitcoin protocol.
4. If a sufficient quantity of bitcoin is transacted using SegWit, the cartel would switch from SegWit to treat all transactions using the original protocol. Cartel members could then instantly use the “AnyOneCanSpend” address from SegWit to steal funds from the transactions in blocks they mined (especially any high-value block). To incentivize miners to join the cartel, the cartel could agree that each member distributes stolen funds from their attacked blocks to the whole the group in some proportion (for example, according to the hash rate each maintains.) No one miner or mining pool would need to itself have 51% of the hash rate in order to participate.
This is one of several hundred attack scenarios which SegWit could open. Under a SegWit regime, such attacks against the bitcoin network could work because the economics of the system would be changed; rather than illicit activity being discouraged, it would be encouraged under SegWit. This seems to be the aspect of the system that is least understood by Bitcoin Core developers and other proponents of SegWit.
There have been several large individual transactions even in the early days of bitcoin. As noted above, it is not however any individual transaction that creates the major risk to the network; rather it is the overall level of transactions within any one block. As bitcoin scales, it will become more and more likely that a large high-value block will come to exist. Looking at the Visa and MasterCard transaction processing rate, it would be expected that in certain peak transaction times, the collected pool of transactions within a short time period (for example, 1 to 2 hours) could lead to scenarios where total transaction volumes exceed USD $100 billion if bitcoin scales to be the predominant form of Internet money. At such levels, even a normally honest miner could be incentivised to defect from the standard protocol.

I think after it bounces off the 987MA and then when the 610MA crosses down through it. The price may make a triple bottom. Causing some to give up hope for the last time. This will probably be the the final straw for some. Then a nice run to the 100X in price!

You probably use the same password at both. So was probably super easy for the guy. Then he wiped out your account. there are lots of ppl on here that got ripped off the same way you did. its not your email provider. a few thousand dollars isn't worth the reputation damage they would receive from this

@_date: 2017-05-21 08:54:47
Ur right it won't stay at 2k long, it's going to 10k
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:08:29
why would you want dollars over Bitcoin? it's not about accumulating dollars it's about accumulating Bitcoin.

Dude u missed bear season, it was 2014-2015. Just let it go, go bull now. Or by the time u let ur brain change, it will be at 100k. You'll finally wanna buy and it will be set for another 2 year bear market.
Put down the weed and quit being paranoid.
@_date: 2015-10-18 13:38:03
i think its funny everyone wants to make there own coin,  they will just get by passed up for bitcoin and all the investors will lose.
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:58:49

You think that's crazy? Watch $spy during bad news. Sky rockets and doesn't take a breath. If you want on you just have to jump on and hope that wasn't the top.
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:24:49
you must not understand Lightning. Instead of amazon having 100 million differant lightning channels they only need ones to major lightning nodes/banks. If you wanna pay though lightning you will probably need to go through one of those nodes/banks. These nodes require alot of bitcoin becasue they are doing all the transactions inhouse before they write to the blockchain. Just like a regular bank would do.
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:08:20
because they are the on and off ramp for most

@_date: 2017-07-31 00:02:07
you could tell this to people all day long, as soon as it goes below 2000k ppl will panic and think BCC is going in the gutter, 2 months later when its under 1000$ some random fud or a programing fault about sigwit will come out and BCC will rocket above current price. all BCC sellers will be on the wrong side of the tracks. Its a guareentee. This is the only way to get long term holders to sell their coins. The Uber rich say rich by tricking normal people into giving there shit away for free or at a discount. They arnt buying bitcoin at 3k, but they will get you at under 1k. Dont be a fool, dont give your BCC away for free.
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:18:29
then sit on the couch watching Netflix for the month with the $7 you made, and been fearful of the profit you are losing as it just keeps rising. Always thinking about the price you originally paid for it, cuz it's never coming back. By the time the realized loss of not buying back in today kicks in. you will finally pull the trigger to only watching it fall. you will then panic sell and then watch it continue to rise. Rinse and Repeat. When bitcoins ready you won't need to sell, you just spend it.

Bitcoin is right up their ally, when he branched out the banks with his sons it was to prevent a country or some other power from wiping out the bank, there was no money to be stolen it was in some other branch in another country. BITCOIN, not physical so can't be taken. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:36:34
its just fraud prevention, just call them
