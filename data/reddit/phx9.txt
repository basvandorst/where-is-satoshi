for mined and untouched bitcoin, I doubt anyone owes taxes anywhere...
@_date: 2019-04-24 09:33:42
To mine the last bitcoin you can also mine the last few million consecutive blocks, but I would not count it as successful if anyone breaks your combo....

@_date: 2019-04-26 08:18:39
Sure you can. Just send over to 1111111111111111111141MmnWZ and enjoy yourself on the warmth of the miners trying to collect your tx fee!

Right after releasing a truely unhackable bitcoin wallet, eating  his dick and exposing  satoshi he  will do it! Count on it! It's a matter of minutes now! \*holds breath\*

Every time someone buys bitcoin someone sells them for fiat. This fiat is presumably used to buy goods and services.
This guy is so ignorant, just reminds me of Satoshi not having time to explain...
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:43:55
super easy in my experience,  videoident, matter of minutes
@_date: 2019-04-23 02:11:03
I guess one could have argued that another chain becomes bitcoin if they gather the most hashrate and have user acceptance. But only if this would happen in a reasonably short time frame, maybe a few weeks or such after fork.
Also it's not the length that matters, but always the accumulated work. And even this is hard to compare at some point, maybe one chain forbids asic boost, another does not... how would one compare?

you wanted to get scammed on getscammed.com using the getscammed technique. 
if cloud mining would be profitable, they would not sell contracts. if you want to mine at profit i fear you have to run the operation your self.

It's also very risky if you have laser printed paperwallets/info folded up - laser printers apply sort of plastic to the paper, it might melt together....

short url links to  [ this\]8tz1ysnld1rf7.hop.clickbank.net/  which is blocked by my ad blocker - so no free "real" bitcoins for me :(
@_date: 2019-04-23 13:33:56
I'd not use this metric. a simple transaction is very small,  the desired tx is very simple thus small. your average includes multi input multi output transactions which are more expensive. it surly can be considered an absolute upper bound...

my rule was: I'll spend a tiny fraction of my coin if/when it has huge impact on my life. 
so I bought my flat late 2017... stretched the definitions of 'tiny fraction' a bit for that :)
@_date: 2019-04-30 21:44:02
Looks nice, can I get a picture of the back side please?
@_date: 2019-04-28 09:29:38
The 600€ are the gains that you allowed to take without having to pay tax. So if you buy for 400 and sell at 1000 in one year it's still tax free even if you held &lt; 1 year. I'm not a professional thou.
@_date: 2019-04-28 09:27:46
Unless you generate income with the asset. If you lend them for example. Then its 10 years I heard. Airdrops (bytball, stellar) don't count as income it seems.
@_date: 2019-04-30 10:17:40
Well, it won't reduce the miners fee. It will reduce the fee of this tx by making it smaller. Miners can pack more of those into a block. That means that even with a way higher fee rate, so a way higher fee collected by miners, the per user fee might still be lower. Just like bigger blocks without the burden in bandwidth and storage.

til btc was invented to solve the age old problem of tax dodging.
@_date: 2019-04-30 21:21:50
I mined bitcoin on pc hardware, declared it to the tax authorities, they didn't care.

Why not just use Wasabi or any other coinjoin implementation?

Same here, even with family... I just ignore it, don't need to defend my self. I assume it's a mix of being jelly when it goes up and self righteousnes when it goes down. Whatever.

So, did they collect the bounty, at least partially?
@_date: 2019-04-22 17:13:59
You could make it even better by making an even smaller paper wallet print out instead of this chunky bit of hardware. HiRes pictures please!

Well, we have the lightning network - set up a channel for $200 and micro-tx him $2.5 every week. This can be automated, but it's not trivial to do it yet.
Friend of mine did something like this with his children (without ln obv.), got a bit weird when they held $10k to their name a few years later.... learned the lesson of hodling early :D
@_date: 2019-09-04 04:30:38
That's not being pedantic, that's trying to figure out what you are saying. Especially with it being unclear if it's per hour or per 10 minutes or maybe even per day.
@_date: 2019-09-02 11:59:30
That's exactly the point. Spend money for an offline-wallet and store the info in the cloud...
@_date: 2019-09-07 11:46:18
Size is measured in kilobytes, and depends on the number of inputs and outputs (and possibly scripts). Amount/Value refers to the number of bitcoin. So if you have 10k btc in one utxo and transfer it, it costs the same as transferring 0.00001btc that is held in one utxo. If you consolidate 100000 utxos and spend them to 100 addresses, it will cost WAY more.

New alientec that allows you to buy a fraction of a bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:37:11
this was true at no time.
@_date: 2019-05-15 13:01:40
You don't need kyc to transfer bitcoin. Right.
But with regard to:


Try buying a nice house with bitcoin for, say, $2M. You will very fast realise how much your corrupt governments law applies.
@_date: 2019-05-08 07:21:36
it is a second factor, so it adds to the threshold no matter how easy it is to overcome. also this attack does not scale to well...
@_date: 2019-05-08 07:23:14
they might get coinjoined... fbi will monitor and then know they lost trace

~~So you don't trust the https server, that's why you pgp check. This is a good idea. But given that you don't trust the server, it's a bad idea to take it's output and pass it as an argument to curl.~~


~~this line takes the server output, the dangerous part is the "." in the "\[\]+" expression, where literally anything can be. like an extra url and an extra parameter, to include lets say some wallet.dat in an upload to~~ [~~

you get them from china for $1.60, including shipping. I wonder what the shipping cost is here....
@_date: 2019-05-02 14:15:01
and that is exactly why there is a premium... people selling crypto for fiat take it to mitigate their risk of not being able to withdraw.
@_date: 2019-05-02 08:10:38
I'm slightly relieved ;-)
guess I forgot some /s before...
@_date: 2019-05-01 09:55:15
So you say it has to have bitcoin in it's name?
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:36:16
unless you spend it somewhere with kyc. then you go to jail.  happens all the time.  just because the ledger is permission less does not mean bitcoin and it's users are not concerned by law.
@_date: 2019-05-01 15:33:12
great and everything, but the article...


lol what? right lnd, c-lightning and eclair focus on testnet, never plan to go main.  oh wait, they were pioneering and not completely stupid....
@_date: 2019-05-04 10:29:16
thanks for the explanation
@_date: 2019-05-01 11:11:13
I thoght that was impossible, as testnet  addresses have a different identifier or such...
@_date: 2019-05-15 12:58:41
Ledger was vulnerable via a compromised controlling computer. It did not check the change addresses, just assumed "output  is me, everything is fine".
Just update to latest firmware and you are fine.

This is the most confusing reply I ever got. Did you come back to defend your scam?
@_date: 2019-05-19 12:36:52
Real estate prices are not an unknown mystery. Government knows what property is worth, and if you report unrealistic prices they might investigate, at the very least it might be considered a payment to $1M to you (your received 1M more than what you payed for). This has nothing to do with bitcoin. Government does not like value flowing without getting it's share. I would not pay any income tax, my boss would just sell me all I need for $1 - problem solved.
Sure, you can cut a few percent here and there, but if it's suddenly about much money things get complicated.
@_date: 2019-05-15 07:46:46
not remotely exploitable, just possible to extract data if you have the device. not good, but far from horrible. passphrase users not affected. 
ledger on the other hand... better update :)
