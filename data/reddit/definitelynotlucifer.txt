If you paid your taxes on those assets then they have no choice but to pursue it as Grand Larceny because of the amount lost, you could force the issue with legal assistance. You may also declare losses against this theft in that case. However, if these were off the record assets you have no legal recourse.

Thanks. When I used the raw numbers like that I got closer to BTC=$640,000.
BTC's richest man, the 15^th Order, would have ($472.9Billion) $472,877,952,000.

As long as people exist long enough, I agree. Crypto will take over, even if we just have digital fiat.
Cash will only exist in the black-market &amp; perhaps countries like North Korea/Qatar/Congo.

BTC is too valuable to give to Walmart. I don't give them my worthless &amp; constantly devaluing USD, why would I give them real money?

Even 1 Bitcoin is out of most people's reach. Bitcoin are rare.

Sometimes, Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three. Sometimes they are all of them at once. You must try harder. It is not easy to become sane.
