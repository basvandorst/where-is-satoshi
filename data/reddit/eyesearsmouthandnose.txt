I believe this is the largest threat to bitcoin. Battle of the blockchains. But really, it's a battle of "trust". Who should John &amp; Jane Public trust? The bitcoin blockchain or the r3 blockchain?
It must be acknowledged that big banks have much more resources and political influence than our enthusiast community. **They are well versed at organizing manufactured public perception.** Can we compete with the big banks deep pocketbooks, Washington connections, and their long reach into the mainstream media? Yes, we can, but we need sophisticated arguments, distilled into simple to understand narratives that the general public can easily digest.

I smell a war between blockchains brewing in the market: distributed bitcoin blockchain vs big bank blockchain. Big banks will argue their blockchain should be trusted and not the bitcoin blockchain. We need to have sophisticated, yet publicly digestible arguments for the bitcoin blockchain, because in the end, clever marketing will win.

I just read your essay. You make very valid and well thought out arguments.

Replacing SWIFT would be difficult, mostly for political reasons. Western governments threaten exclusion from the SWIFT network as part of financial sanctions when dealing with countries they don't agree with, say Iran, for instance. Exclusion from the SWIFT network cuts a country of from foreign capital markets, which strangles a country's economy. That's the kind of power a government doesn't let go of. Bitcoin could disrupt that power by eliminating the threat of capital markets exclusion. But I don't see that being allowed to happen any time soon.

Ingenious use of the blockchain. Since you're taking questions, I want to jump into an innovative start-up using the blockchain technology. You guys looking for a skilled technology manager?

I agree that having the increased functionality Turing completenes provides comes at a cost of opening up potential angles of attack. However, that doesn't mean that given enough resources, time, and testing that this problem cannot be solved. It's a complex problem, but it can have a solution.

Bitcoin created decentralized trust. Understanding the implications of this are critical in understanding bitcoin. 
As OP described wonderfully above, our current system relies on a bank to act as a trusted third-party when two parties are transacting. For example, when I swipe a debit card at a store, the bank tells the store that I have enough funds to pay for my items. The store trusts the bank response, thus trusting me to walk out of the store with merchandise and that they will be paid. 
Bitcoin shows that trust doesn't need a centralized third-party (i.e. banks) to establish trust. You can have a decentralized network of trust instead. People can easliy, safely, and securely transact on this network of decentralized trust. This is ground breaking. It completely disrupts a major value proposition for banks.

The government could easily create stiff penalties on businesses that accept Bitcoin. Some businesses would defy and be punished. The others would capitulate and stop accepting Bitcoin as payment.

Perhaps the other route the government would take is to make *anonymous* Bitcoin transactions illegal.

Maybe he did. Maybe he didn't. It is easy to believe him and this upcoming big money player buying Bitcoin he referenced because he appears to have some authority or access to information that we don't. It could be true, or maybe not.
I can't tell you how many times I've been burned by the "appeal to authority" fallacy. I've learned to always be skeptical, even if someone has a billion dollars and a PhD. Trust yourself first.

Excellent point. Thank you for that insight. I see your point of view and it cleared up my understanding.

I'm fairly well connected with IT at Overstock. It's great that they are excited about bitcoin, however, they don't hold onto the bitcoins they receive to use for future company transactions, thus increasing the velocity of bitcoin. Instead, once they receive a bitcoin in payment, they instantly convert it into dollars. It's still great that they accept them as payment though. And I'm not sure if this is standard practice with other companies that accept bitcoin.

Connected enough to know what I'm talking about.

Prepare for the blockchain, the ledger-of-the-future, to become privatized and regulated. This article spells it out quite clearly. Hence the reason top-level banking executives and former congressman are getting in on this by creating Bitcoin companies. They know the technology is innovative and disruptive. They also see that the writing is on the wall, that regulation of the blockchain will clear the path for private companies to make enormous amounts of money. They will extract transaction costs of every exchange. This will largely negate the genius of the blockchain, that it is not centralized.

The basis of this question infers that bitcoin is a currency investment vehicle. The idea that if you exchange dollars into bitcoin, wait for bitcoin to rise in value against dollars, then exchange back into dollars reaping a nice profit is the wrong way to look at bitcoin. 
We need to break the habit of thinking of bitcoin in terms of dollars. Think of bitcoin in terms of what resources it can buy, not how many dollars you can exchange from bitcoin. For example, buying a nice pair of designer jeans is $300. Those same jeans would also be 1 BTC.

Appealing to authority bias. Sometimes useful. Sometimes dead wrong.
