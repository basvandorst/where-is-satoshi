You're talking to 14-year-olds whose view of the office life comes from TV.

That's hilarious. Anyone who got burned by that is a fucking idiot.

Is there much difference between doing this with bitcoins and doing it with volatile stocks?
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:13:19
Well my point was that it's the same thing and others have crashed and burned doing it so be careful. You were talking about leverage / doing it on margin and that's where it gets messy if you're over-confident.
Definitely get the idea of retirement out of your head based on your recent successes because that could lead to major heartache if it goes wrong. Just treat it as a nice hourly wage for the time-being and focus on improving it.

No-one will buy it if it's just some guy's software that controls their bitcoins and by nature, must be open to the net.
Software like this only works if it's open source or backed my a large institution so there's trust.
Just keep developing it for your own use.
