Except this isn't r/liferepair it's r/bitcoin. So a lot of us have advice for people asking about bitcoin. Not so much with the bullshit personal judgements though.

Human being before porn star. There is no reason she shouldn't scoop up the vanity names of her choice from all kinds of services. My guess is that bitcoin will account for a small portion of her total income and so I'd recommend just holding it. No need for coinbase in that case.

Wait a minute? She actually deleted tweet with a bitcoin address in it for fear that someone might steal bitcoins that weren't even hers yet?! Nope! That's just crazy. She should put an address in her bio not some random tweet. A long random password that only she knows will go a LONG way towards keeping her bitcoins safe. 2factor and it's basically a wrap.

Donations are super easy.  Download a wallet like electrum or just sign up for a blockchain.info wallet. Generate some new keypairs. Display public key on site, twitter, whatever. Even better, label the keys in your wallet and post different keys in different places and track where your receiving the most donations. Coinbase is fine, but the mere fact that a question arises about whether they'll allow her to use their service  highlights the non-disruptive "disruption" going on. Remove third parities. Don't pick new ones. 
Accepting bitcoin for content or subscriptions isn't much harder. And because the majority of people will still use credit cards, she should just keep her bitcoin. 
Porn is a far better way to pay for college than debt. Keep up the good work!

Human trash? Really? You're on the wrong subreddit. Go spout your shit elsewhere.
