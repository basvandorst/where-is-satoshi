This event was a first for us because we decided to create a Cryptocurrency Tip Jar (CryptJar) The jar is a way for artists to accept currencies across all artificial borders and nations. We tried our best to spread the word about how Blockchain technology can empower average people, no matter where they are. We will be registering this painting on the Vechain network as well as selling it on a platform called ArtWallet ([ later this year. They are allowing artists to sell their work without the hassle of brokers and middlemen through the use of smart contracts.  As artists are doing what we can to show people that this technology has a place in our world.   We hope to connect, educate, and inspire as many people as we can through genuine interactions and sharing of our time.

What you say here really has me thinking.
On one hand, it sounds fair to pay content creators... conversely, knowledge should be available to anyone.
Its definitely a fun proof of concept, however
