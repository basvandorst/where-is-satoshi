Binding ones self to a social contract is one thing. Completely giving up control of every aspect of your life is another.
 As to the federal Reserve and the government in general, there is a minority of wealthy individuals that have a disproportionate amount of influence on our law makers. Crypto currencies is  not some anarchist movement. It's just one small attempt at individual independence.

If BTC acceptance were wide spread enough, a traveler would not need to concern themselves with converting to local currency. They would also not be worried about getting their card or travelers cheques stolen.

Sure I understand. But on an only slightly related note I just attempted to donate to the eff but didn't because their btc minimum is $5.00. So I gave my $3 to wikipedia. If a lot of people donate a dollar or two it can really add up.

If I see a tip of only a few cents outside a crypto related sub, I view it as spam and downvote accordingly.

I have Netflix yet sometimes I go entire months without watching it. Some sort of ppv plan would be ideal for me. Now hopefully they don't go as expensive as YouTube did.

I've enjoyed reading your arguments. However, some people simply don't want the government having so much control over their daily lives. A currency controlled by the people gives us a small amount of independence back.

Our hypothetical scenario assumes widespread BTC acceptance. So you'd be buying meals, bus tickets, hostels/hotels etc. Difficult to get scammed on that.

Haha I like the way you think. Now if only we had a digital peso so I don't have to carry around a bunch of cash.

$1 by itself does not, but the point of tipping is that the content is worth multiple people contributing that dollar. Now I know you addressed the accumulation aspect but this is different from people giving 1.5 cents or something like that. Hopefully if one person thought it was worth tipping $1 lots of people will. And that collects a lot faster than a bunch of people throwing pennies around.

I agree with most of what you have written here. I use reddit a lot and It can be very annoying to see numerous tips at only a few cents. That being said I think your amount might be to high. $1 might be more resonable @_date: 2014-10-16 18:08:35
Unfortunately I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not. In case you are of course there's risk. If you're using a smart phone for the transactions your phone could be stolen. Obviously this risk is mitigated by encrypting your wallet and or phone. 
It also might be a good idea to encrypt the private keys and but that onto something like Dropbox just in case.

Last I heard major credit agencies like transunion, equifax etc changed their algorithm. There is very little emphasis on credit inquiries nowadays.
