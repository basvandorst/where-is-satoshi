If there isn't one it would be a case of it being sent to an address owned by rehcakxfb and then the edit would cover up the address not being on the list.

Sadly if I know the media (and I used to work on the design side), it's going to get a lot worse.
I'm not a lawyer, but I think pretty much the best thing you can do is put the funds in multisig escrow and contact the FBI yourself and explain the situation. That way the funds cannot be seized, they're safe and you're covered in case anything does go FUBAR. 
* Case 1: Bitcoins are seized, you're safe and covered.
* Case 2: FBI tells you it's fine, business as usual however you're half a million dollars richer...
Luckily bitcoin has features built for situations like this. If you need help setting up a multisig wallet (or an explanation why and how it works), give me a shout.

Well I think the bad part is although the communities perception is that they're not from the Bitfinex hack, the media however has a different perception.
There have been a number of major news outlets, including Sky and Motherboard who have run articles on the lottery.... and you can be sure they'll be posting follow up articles (as is normal in journalism). The sad part is that you will be under a lot of scrutiny by people who dig for dirt as part of their job.
Furthermore, Bitfinex is working in conjunction with the FBI and several EU agencies. As part of due diligence, they will need to look into the source due the alleged source of the funds being stated were from the Bitfinex. They would need to determine that the funds were not from the Bitfinex hack (or potentially any others).

The US equivalent of the EC certification is the FCC certificate. The EC is mandated in the EU, I think the FCC is mandated in the US but I'm not 100% sure (as I'm in the EU).

I'm sure I'm stating the obvious here (so I'd like to hear the opposing view), why not use a multisig wallet to increase the reserves?
That way you can increase the reserves without needing to trust someone. If you were to do that I would suggest branching out to people outside of the BitcoinTalk area and maybe speak to other people in other areas (like  Ops - though in the interest of transparency I have to declare I am one).

They offered after I gave them all the details and photos.
When they kept changing the goal posts about I would get refund + shipping before I shipped, I get refund when it had arrived (it would cost £75 to ship it back to the US), I would get refund when tested, I would get refund when it was deemed not their fault etc...
I actually ended up giving it to the HSE after they refused 8 times to supply the CE Certificate which is mandated by law. They kept ignoring the request (but replying to other stuff in the email) or stalling saying that it was with their UK agent (despite the manufacturer being responsible and liable for CE/FCC certification).
I have the entire email chain to also back this up (as does the FTC).

@_date: 2015-06-18 18:45:03
Sadly not, though the FTC is suing their ass off currently (with several EU agencies interested as well now).
The people I've spoken to at the FTC were really nice and understanding when I told them that BFL refused to give me a refund when my Monarch caught fire. They were REALLY interested in that as it looks like the damn things aren't CE or FCC certified (which is illegal). My device is with the Health &amp; Safety Executive for testing and it looks like a lot more trouble is heading their way!
Ironically it was a ~£310 refund, but now looks like they're going to be fined several £xx,xxx's and the best part? They can't escape a criminal investigation for negligence &amp; fraud by closing the company, as they would be personally liable (especially certain roles).
Karma's a bitch...
@_date: 2015-06-19 10:09:59
It's always been required. It's a EU law and required under the low voltage requirement.
You'll often find non-CE compliant devices, especially from China, but it doesn't make them legal. The CE certificate is a health and safety certification to ensure safety.

Well how about BTCJam release details of people who refuse to pay back so they can be pursued for repayment... you know people like Aethero who has an outstanding loan for 932BTC from last year.
It is well known in the bitcoin community that BTCJam allows scammers to operate to freely without the possibility of a reprisal, until that is resolved (and please dont throw "But BTCJam uses an arbitration service"), I suspect that the reputation will continue.
Rastanikoten stated 'Over 70% of all Bitcoin loaned out through BTCJam is paid back' that would mean that upto 30% (almost 1/3 of all loans) are not paid back. Now personally I wouldn't loan at a place where I have ~1 in 3 chance of not being paid back.

Whilst I accept that it is the personal responsibility of a lender to ensure the lendee is legit, however there needs to be some ingress into issue resolution by BTCJam.
Someone, Aethero is a prime example, can build reputation in the community as part of a long con and then disappear with a very large amount of cash.
Historically BTCJam hasn't done anything to help the victims of the scammer, using reprisals as the reason why. Simple put, there have been many, many scammers doxxed but as yet none (to my knowledge) have been physically harmed.
Like I said, until BTCJam makes a stance against these people, the reputation as being a "Scammer's Paradise" will persist.

Yeah, my bad. Craps is lower odds, and blackjack differs depending on the setup
You'll loose 14.1 cents loss per $10 gambled with Craps (49.2929% odds) unless you bet with the house and then it's 0.4 cents loss per $10 gambles.
Works out as (pardon my maths...):
* Blackjack: 98.34% - 99.7% payback (3c - 16c loss per $10)
* Craps: 98.6% payback (14c loss per $10)
* European Roulette: 97.3% payback (27c loss per $10)
* US Roulette: 94.7% payback (54c loss per $10)

Yes, sending to and sending from are completely different.
In order to send you must know the private key of the address(es) you're sending from. The flaw with your system is that once you know someone's name you can simply generate the private key.
A person simply generates the address (name)-bitcoin-username, it spits out the private keys, then anyone else moves it. Once it's gone, it's gone.
I noticed that the 0.0002BTC that you placed has just moved... try reclaiming it even though you know the private key (and so does everyone else...)

Okay, lets take  for example. A user can authenticate using either their address or GPG key. Both methods include signing something.
So using the above method I could sign in as you because I was able to generate address by knowing your passphrase.
The identity is not secure because the passphrase that was used to generate it follows a pattern, thus insecure. To use this system as a way to authenticate is flawed.
* Use it as a wallet and your coins can be taken by someone else.
* Use it as a way to identify and authenticate and your identity can be taken allowing someone else to portray themselves as you (aka Nicksquatting) with the added perk (for them) that all trouble would be traced back to you because you were auth'd and signed.
@_date: 2014-06-08 14:04:03
I use public addresses and private addresses. For example, my OTC address is known as its in the Gribble Database, as is my mining address, Reddit Address and so on... but the system is flawed as your brain wallet passphrase should be completely random. This isn't random, thus not secure. If the aim is to just sign things, then boom: 


I've just verified that I am apparently Whiskers75 (I signed a message saying "I hereby confirm that I am not Whiskers75!").... thus this is why it's not secure. Your security (and thus 'BTC identity') is only as secure as your passphrase.

The large amount of early orders were waiting for 10+ months after initial promised dispatch dates. Others are now waiting on RMA's due to faulty devices (and there seems to be quite a few). No device from BFL will ever reach return of investment, they currently states all backlogs are cleared and stock is in house, yet people are still waiting for orders from Black Friday (according to their forum).
We, the community, invested a lot of time and money into Butterfly Labs and we've been met with scorn, malice, deceit and aggression. This is not a good working practice, and one ultimately doomed to failure. People had enough a long time ago, and this is how they vote... with their money (after being actively refused by BFL contrary to various laws).

BFL have said constantly that they do not use the Blockchain to mine, but they use the Testnet in order to not affect the difficulty. Now we find out that's a big fat lie.
Furthermore they're using customer ASICs to generate bitcoin for themselves, whilst also gathering fees from miners after they ship. Basically, customers are paying for a device. BFL are then using that device to generate BTC for themselves (and lying about it), whilst also collecting fees from the pool. I would say that's a big deal.
In short customer gets screwed over multiply times by BFL, especially as they (now proven) caused the difficulty to rise at the detriment of their customers.
**TL/DR:** It actually is a big deal.

Well considering Josh is the COO; Chief OPERATIONS Officer, it would be very safe to assume that he would know that the miners were being run on Eclipse, especially as it was his own pool formerly.
If he's been given false information, then any pool operator would be like "WTF?! My pool has grown over 20% in a day.... about the same time we switched on the ASICs for testing".
If it looks like bullshit, smells like bullshit, sounds like bullshit.... then you don't have to taste it to know that it's bullshit.

Actually the standard income tax on the Isle of Man is 10% (20% in the UK) with the higher income tax at 20% (40% in the UK or 50% if over £150k).
Non-resident rate is 20% though, which is still cheaper then the UK if you're in the higher income bracket.
So yeah, I'd call that a taxhaven....

Your options are:
* Deepbit - Pretty straight forward, but can only withdraw in rounded figures, 0.02 not 0.02984647 
* 50BTC - Also straight forward, been a little shaky for me personally
* Eligius - 0% fee, made for miners by miners. Takes 120 confirmations for payout though
* Eclipse - BFL_Josh/Inaba's Pool. Personally I won't touch this due to ethical reasons.
These are your main ones, there are many many more, but I've just written from my experience. I personally use 50BTC as primary and Deepbit as my fallover (due to fees).

Basically your operating system generates the code based on bits.
If you tell it you want os.urandom(32) you're requesting a random selection of 32 bytes which is 256 possible random selections (as there are 8 bits in a byte). This means you are in essence:
8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8 ((or 8^32) which is 79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,336 (7.9228163e+28) possible combinations).
As you can see it's pretty easy to randomise something to mathematical improbability to crack based on os.urandom

I had a thought about that.... it really doesn't matter about the quantity. It kinda of takes the average into consideration. 2000 units ordered on one day but 100 units the next day? No problem! That's what mean average is for!
Just means the smaller days are run through faster. As long as they reach the X days orders per production it's all golden.
... and I suspect that BFL know this. We (the customers) have now given them the target deadlines.

Sorry, but I disagree on a number of points.
**Point A:**
Panhandlers (beggars), in my experience, fall into 4 main categories. What you subscribe to is the stereotype of drug addicts or alcoholics. That was only one group of the four main ones I found in my research.  
1. *The Stereotypical Group* - The alcoholics, the drug addicts. This group is the main one that most people mental imagine when thinking of panhandlers/beggars.
2. *The Unfortunate Group* - The people who are down on their luck, the people who cannot afford to pay bills so are evicted. The ex-service personnel who the government turns their backs on. The people who were made redundant because of the economics of the present day. The sad thing is that this group have a very high chance of turning into drug addicts or alcoholics if they don't receive help. Often the difference between people in this group and you, is very little. These are the people you describe in 3. *The Instutionalised Group* - Yes, I know this is an oxymoron and I even stated so in my research. This is the group who have been homeless for so long, they simply cannot adjust to 'normal life'. Often like ex-military or prisoners, they simply exist in routine which is extremely hard to break.
4. *The Career Homeless Group* - Though a very small group, these people exist and choose to be homeless simply because it's more economically viable due to the amount of money they can beg and addition to the help the state gives.
If you're really interested, you can read about it at  (Page 98 - *Life Outside The Margins*)
**Point B:**
Did you know that most charities only require 20% of donated goods/money for the cause which they advertised?
Did you know the CEO of Red Cross, Gail McGovern, earns $473,000 per year?
Did you know the Red Cross built *an entire town* in the Gujarati region of India after the earthquake at a significant cost in which only 1 house is occupied by 4 people (and they rent!). Why does no-one live there? Because it took 3 years to build in which the people who needed the assistance got on with their lives!
Charities aren't the be all and end all of humanitarianism they portray. Many are plagued by a lack of understanding of emergency development and practice. All charities mean well, and success varies from place to place.
I won't tell you who to help, and who not to help. All I wish is that people help *someone*. By the sounds of it you're already pretty switched on, and I commend you for that. I had no idea about so I thank you for that!

I personally use my BTC to help people.
BTC is seen as a libertarian currency, and what's more libertarian then 'natural rights'? In my opinion everyone has a right to a certain standard of life, and that counts everyone in the world.
I personally also believe that if you can help someone, you should help them. simply because you can. There are many people on this planet who can help and many who can't.
You do realise that if 1 guy can help alleviate homeless in his area, how he did it can be rolled out to other places and have (hopefully) the same or greater impact there. Jason has land, land that can be used to erect small low impact buildings which will give people who are homeless a space to re-integrate into society (if they wish it).
What might be seen as a choice in the short term can have very long term implications for many, many people in a positive manner.
I know this, because Jason is ahead of me in the grand schemes ;) It seems we both have the same ambition, just different tactics. This is pretty much how I think... but it's my opinion so you may disagree with me.

Anyway....my tutor asked "How did you get them to dress up as homeless people?" I replied "huh?" (confused obviously). He asked "How did I get actors to dress up as homeless people?

Polytechnic... pffts :P Ain't been a polytechnic for years now. And we're the 4th best architecture school in Britain (yes, yes behind Cambridge :P). Cambridge would have been a bitch to commute to... Oxford is bad enough (I live near Milton Keynes).
I'm mainly looking at Wales for land (£10k an acre). I can currently buy 1 (and a bit acres) outright. The plan is to push it under the Low Impact Development policy (for environmental and cost purposes), but only 4 councils have that currently: Oxford City, Milton Keynes, West Somerset &amp; Pembrokeshire (Wales). Wales did roll out a LID policy nationally though and are the 1st in the world to do so.
That's why Wales has so many 'hobbit houses'. A bloke in Oxford built himself a house for £150 out of cob (clay, straw and sand), and learnt to thatch himself. That's the way I see architecture developing in the future (plus literally building your own house is pretty cool).

I think someone counted the boxes in the back of the USPS van and it was ~80. BFL justification was that was the SECOND van. The other one left with more in.... they just didn't get a picture for whatever reason.
Based on observation for almost a year now, BFL sing and dance when they get something right but go silent when something is wrong.... and they're bloody quiet now.
The van of shipped items and the photos of the mass of ASICs is an example of that. Couple of pictures of a van with ~80 packages and ~90 ASICs on a shelf. Hell that doesn't even show half a days productions of Josh's promised 400 units a day!

I thought the same. If you're going to do something like a wallet you have to above reproach. Hell technically you shouldn't even have access to the funds.
There have been far too many scammer tag requests for me to feel comfortable with him holding my money. Casascius deliberately gave out his details so eliminate any possibility of him defrauding people (and I applaud him for it).
TradeFortress hid behind a handle... and innocent or not he sure as hell looks implicated. The fact that he refuses to involve the police to a $1.3 million theft is highly worrying. I suspect either he did it or he's done something illegal and doesn't want to implicate himself.

As ASICs hit the market (BFL, Avalon, ASICMiner, etc) they all have an impact on the hashrate and as a result, the difficulty. Avalon have stated that they have shipped 800,000 chips (at 400MH/s each) equating to 320TH/s.... that's going to affect the difficulty rate a lot more then 50% per month!

It's not dismissive, it's facts. I'm certainly not being hostile. Anyone who knows me, knows that I'm not hostile. If anything I'm clinically logical.
You're saying that Cloudhashing are paying you significantly more then is possible with a 8Gh/s, plus the fact that you're actually being paid!
I know you said you said you have no idea if your earning are good or bad, I'm simply stating that it's not feasible. With 8Gh you should be earning 0.0129168BTC per day (as run mathematically), you're stating you earn more then double that.
Like I illustrated with the link, there are a great many people who haven't been paid despite having contracts from June/July.
So reading between the lines, Cloudhashing are paying you more then double what you can feasibly earn with 8Gh, paying you on time when others have been waiting *months* for payouts on their contracts.
Surely you can understand why people are skeptical?

Yup, long cleared investment costs. And upgrade equipment.
I'm about $120 clear of all costs. With the difficulty shooting up so much, I thought I would have a blast at it now (as it was making $2 per day in BTC).

@_date: 2013-10-11 23:25:55
Kind of right...
Heatsinks rely on thermal conductivity and thermal loss. Copper has very good thermal conductivity and okay thermal loss. Aluminium has okay conductivity and good thermal loss. This is why modern CPU heatsinks have copper heatpipes and aluminium fins.
The copper absorbs the heat more efficiently then aluminium, but the aluminium sheds that heat more efficiently then copper.
That being said, the *size* of the heatsinks also plays a major factor to efficient cooling, and sad to say they're simply not big enough or have a high enough surface to volume ratio for effective cooling. This is why a fan is needed. Personally I wouldn't bother with the heatsinks as any performance increase will not be cost effective.
If you really want I can formally run the thermal loss equations and post them (if someone can give me the dimensions of a Block Eruptor and the temperature when mining it should take 2-3 minutes...)
The joys of studying architecture and having to run these equations all the time!

He stated that it was stolen by someone else, but refuses to involve the police (for a (then) $1,500,000 theft).

Then I applaud you. One of the things I've faced is that 'many' becomes a way of simply fulfilling a political correctness need.
I'm glad that you actually understand things. I just wish more people were like you. When people denounce homeless people as drug addicts and alcoholics they forget that they are people first and foremost. Of the 'stereotypical' group I interviewed, all did it to escape the reality of being homeless, which is why the 'bad luck' people are in danger of turning to drugs and alcohol.

I need rural areas as well (for comparison). I only have a limited number of rural sites, mainly UK so having access to some cut comb from US would be ideal (as I have samples from US Urban areas).
Basically I only need 5 x 5ml cut comb samples so they can be tested chemically and under the electron microscope. I will of course be willing to give you the results.
Finding feral comb is the hardest part so far....
@_date: 2013-10-12 22:34:20
The heatsinks are cut to provide a larger surface to volume ratio (much like how your intestines work). It's not to increase thermal conductivity, it's to increase thermal loss (how fast the material looses the heat).
Waterblocks work by lowering the 'ambient temperature' ensuring a better thermal transference. The water flow also helps transfer residual heat as well.
To be completely honest, the most cost effective manner to cool a block eruptor would be to use a fan(s) blowing past the miners in a horizontal manner. Most miners use a fan pointing down as they can power it from a USB port. I've seen a few put fans to the side. Enclosing the erupters with a side fan would be more effective still.
But you're talking 1-2oC difference, so I wouldn't sweat it...

Well you can make it look better and add more functionality.
If I was designing an ASIC, I would always include a controller and a screen as a matter of standard design. There were also a number of thermal problems with the current case design.
I addressed these to BFL_StevenM in about April/May, but the case design never changed. The thermal loss is too low, StevenM knew this as he understood all the equations (yes there are equations for this stuff!), but nothing ever changed.
Unfortunately BFL_StevenM left the company apparently, thus BFL lost one of the better staff in my (and many others in the IRC room) opinion.
