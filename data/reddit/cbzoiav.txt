And in a system where the government isn't the central currency issuer banks will still be holding people's wealth in exchange for interest and issuing loans / mortgages to average Joe. And if a major one becomes in danger of going bust governments will have to decide between letting it happen and a lot of people losing their money / having their loans recalled in full with zero notice or bailing them out.

Hey. Makes a nice surprise for someone in a few hundred trillion years when their randomly chosen wallet already has coin in it!

And how is this relevant? Bitcoin avoids government centralisation. It has very little direct impact on banks.

What is your aim? Why do you hold the currency?
If solely as an investment to make money you need to weigh up the risk vs return. If you had $100mn right now would you put it all in bitcoin? Assuming not clearly if ever your bitcoin holdings were worth $100mn it makes sense to sell some. At what point you want to sell and how much you want to sell is down to you personally.
If you have a target in mind where you would sell everything and are willing to expose yourself to the risk of storing on an exchange then just set up a limit order to sell when it hits that and forget about it.
Another option is to sell less than your returns. I.e every time the price raises 20% sell 10%. This recovers 12% of your initial investment and leaves 108% of it in the market. Next time it's gone up 20% you do the same - this time you get ~13% of the initial investment so have pulled out 25% and still have ~117% in the market.

A lot of these services offer you the ability to log in on other machines with just a username/password. This cannot work unless the wallet is stored on the server.


This way its never in plain text on their server. There is no risk of them storing it unencrypted (either in a database or accidentally in a log file etc). It also means if someone compromises their server there is reduced risk of your wallet being compromised (they can serve malicious JavaScript but that only works if you use the site while compromised).


I'm a security focused developer. I know how this works..


Yes - but this is a Web based wallet product. Browser based wallets without (client side encrypted) server stored wallets have very little sell over a dedicated application (and come with security issues not applicable to installed applications ).

To the bank sure but why should that impact the end user?
In the UK we already have the faster payments service. Transfers generally appear to happen instantly.
The challenger banks take this further and show debit card transactions as soon as they occur.

They can store the wallet encrypted on the server but they should encrypt it with the user password in JavaScript on the client.
If they have a password reset function that works after you've cleared your browser cache then they are not doing this and could access your wallet.

I work at a bank - I understand how this works.
For FPS it's not daily - its three times a day. But all the participating banks must hold accounts at the bank with balances at least as high as the maximum debt position they are willing to accept from the FPS system.
So while it's only actually updated with the Bank of England three times a day they all keep cash in a central location - there isnt really a reason why the BOE couldn't update their ledger in real time leading to effective instant clearing.
And because of the margin stored at the central bank there is no counterparty risk (beyond the BOE itself).

As above- while they have a European banking license (Estonia) they dont offer products though it.
@_date: 2019-06-15 12:42:35
In the US maybe. In the UK and a handful of other European countries challenger fintech banks are doing incredibly well right now.
Imagine the situation is similar in Asia, Africa and South America.

2 hour fast transfers arent a thing outside Europe and are barely a thing outside the UK.
Meanwhile showing them before clearance in the UK offers a major impact.

Monzo, Starling, Metro Bank. To an extent Revolut (they have a banking license but dont issue their accounts through it yet afaik).

Internally the company could have had a large number of wallets with coins moved automatically by software between them. For example when a client wanted to send bitcoin in they would have to be given an address to send it to. Thus would then likely be moved to a central holding wallet. Then more wallets for handling exchanges and withdrawals etc.
It's more than possible a bug could have moved coins about in ways they struggled to trace. This means they might still control the money but have no idea which accounts it's in or if they used disposable wallets the money may be In accounts they deleted the private keys for.
Alternatively someone could have found a place in the system where they could skim off bitcoin without it being immediately noticeable. Eventually someone realised there was far less in there than there should be and looked into it.


So taken from the main exchange wallet. There would be thousands of transactions from this every day so unless you had actice monitoring systems it could easily be missed.

For transfers the clearance is effectively immediate.
For debit card transactions they remove from the available balance either way. You can show the transaction immediately with a small indication its pending and if its cancelled show that too.
On the cost front the vast majority of UK retail bank accounts have no charge for having the account, transfers, debit card usage or using the card at a cash machine. They are offered as loss leaders with the money made back from credit products like loans and mortgages (a large chunk of people just go to their existing bank rather than shopping around).

I know its three times a day on weekdays. Not certain on weekends and bank holidays.


The margin must exceed the amount owed at all times - it's in part why its settled three times a day. It should be noted FPS can only be used for smaller transactions (hard limit of £250k but in reality banks enforce limits varying from £5k-£100k).
Not actually certain whether payments are frozen if its exceeded or whether they would get investigated by the regulator but afaik it has never happened.
@_date: 2019-06-15 16:22:06
Those banks currently push useful features like instant transaction logs, categorisation, low fees and free foreign use etc.
Dont even know if they offer credit facilities yet and if they do they dont heavily push them.

This will also depend on your definition of investors. There will likely be plenty of people like me that have 0.2-5 coins worth left over from playing with it in the earlier days and then forgetting about it until it started making the news for big value thresholds.
At several of them I told myself I'd sell and never got around to it. So I have a few thousand dollars worth just through lazyness.
