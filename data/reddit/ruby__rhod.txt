Any 2016 chart of Hashrate, TPS, or Avg. blocksize would indicate precisely the opposite.

While clearly about Blockchain tech, this article omits a critical distinction - Private vs. Public. 
Albeit a subtle omission, it radically changed the financial estimates detailed in the article. Utilizing an established public Blockchain (i.e. BTC) implementation costs would be substantially less, and arguably security would make a marked improvement.  
The same arguments were discussed with the dawn of financial data centers and hosted data center solutions - This debate has raged for 30 years. Financial institutions are very cautious with capital funds. Investor funds is a different story all together.

Banks offer the ability to move monies around to their customers - It's a core business for them.  While they are fairly good at it (financial datacenters are impressive beasts), it's quite expensive. Facility Infrastructure, computing, and security costs are significant overheads to all current major financial institutions. 
Bitcoin has been open source since 2009; port 8333. It wasn't built with public or private financing; it was voluntary global financing (Crowdsourcing may be the term in vogue). It's growth to the networks current combined computing power leaves current banks in the dust, relatively.  The future is always unknown, but thus far bitcoin's Blockchain is screaming out of the opening gates. 
The internet didn't eliminate the Newspaper Titans, but it certainly changed them. This world is an interesting place ��

By acting as a cartel. Just like they illuminated the €500 note.

Further evidence supporting the value of Satoshi's vision, whereby trust between peers becomes inherent and automatic. The actions of Top Tier Banks in this case provides its own judgement.  Not only are they incapable of acting with trust, they are actively collaborating to deceive their customers.
