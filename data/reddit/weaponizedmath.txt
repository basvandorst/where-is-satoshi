Here are some excellent reasons
The government fails at everything. The Fed is highly socialized and I wager it cannot compete in the market without gov't thuggery to enforce it.
The government cannot take your crypto from you. It's impossible to enforce. This forces the Fed to compete.
If The Fed can release a coin that the market deems better than Bitcoin, good. They can't do that without defeating themselves, though.

Segwit is drastically different than Bitcoin. Bitcoin Maximalism is often wrongly thought of making Bitcoin the only cryptocurrency. It means you only need Bitcoin because you can always maintain the original vision through a fork of Bitcoin.
I think increasing the block size was so much simpler than 2-3 years of drama and 5300 lines of new code (3500ish are unit tests) just because the Core dev team is afraid of the blocksize and competition among implementations

It was exclusively Core's fault. 
There was zero reason not to bump up the block size in the interim while Segwit was being worked on. It was politics and marketing to force an over complicated solution to a simple problem. 
Coincidentally, the Core team's solution is in direct competition to those who benefit from a block size increase. But nah, Core is just a bunch of benevolent dictators. It was a power grab and nothing more.

@_date: 2017-08-03 03:50:06
So that last line, the one that begins with 'coincidentally'
Yeah, read it again. The miners are the ones who benefit from larger blocks because they get to do more business.  Segwit / Reducing blocksize to a single hash kills their entire business. The developers have a harder time because they have a more difficult computer science problem to solve. As someone who appreciates Bitcoin, I am respectful of their investment and understand why they may be upset over the livelihood being destroyed.
Segwit is interesting but it doesn't actually solve the problem. It just changes the way Bitcoin works to avoid the problem. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:08:26
Miners are more reluctant about segwit than they are about blockade block size.
The NYA is the Hong Kong agreement where miners accepted segwit under the condition they they get larger blocks. Core refused to work with them. So it delayed for years until Silbert fixed it.

I agree, but whether it is likely true or not does not make it anything more than platitude or hyperbole depending on how its being used. My perception is that it is irrelevant.
The expectation that most users will not run a full node does not mean we start targeting enterprise hardware as the barrier to entry.
It was a long road but I would like to see block size reduced. I do not think Satoshi had a scaling strategy. If Bitcoin was purely settlement and everyone could participate on a smart phone with a pruned blockchain I would be happy. Though that's unlikely to happen.

Then you don't understand what is at stake. Unnecessarily conceding sets the precedent that if you are a big enough threat the network will bend to your will. That's the opposite of what this project's purpose entails.
I am pro Fork anyone who threatens the network off the network. But that's not a solution for the same reason.

Without them being able to take part is anticompetitive and ultimately just as oppressive for them. Ultimately capitalism thrives best in diversity. If a tinfoil hat conspiracy comes true and first world nation states do something crazy like...

That's the coercion people reference. China has tight trade controls. Jihan Wu is the only manufacturer or miners sold in China. He controls a majority of hash rate through his influence. E.g. the majority of hash rate is in China.
If Chinese miners want to continue to operate their business they have to buy miners from Jihan Wu.
It's equivalent to a gold mining company having one person sell them shovels and equipment. That person doesn't own their company but if he tells them to jump and they don't ask how high it wouldn't be difficult to ignore said company and pick a new winner.
Jihan Wu = Fiat. Most of us came to Bitcoin to escape Fiat and currencies that are controlled by individuals. By proxy, Jihan Wu is able to use coercion to control the majority of hash rate.


No for above mentioned reasons.


2mb is a red herring. The true battle is "Do we legitimize people once they become a big enough threat?" This is not a technological issue. This is governance vs government.

@_date: 2017-07-28 21:58:45
That's an impressive misrepresentation.
If Antpool stoppped mining and the difficulty began to sag it would immediately begin to attract other people. This change protects BCC from a large miner hopping on the network, mining the difficulty to something astronomical and then hopping off the network.
A lower difficulty would result in a loss to any miner attempting to gain it **as there is automated software checking exchange rates that will automatically target BCC as the difficulty goes down**

Because the majority of children in this sub don't have the ability or the intelligence to figure it out themselves. They externalize their own thinking process to the loudest voices and some of them think that because someone is a developer that makes them an expert. 
This sub - not this community - think Hard Forks are bad because the team of developers calling themselves Core developers originally countered a simple hard fork to upgrade with their own hard fork. They then back pedaled and represented the same solution as an even more technically challenging soft fork under the branding that hard forks are bad. 
Now they can't step back from that and save face and this community of lemmings and parrots is suffering for it - not Bitcoin. Hard forks are great. It gets us away from these people

I don't think what you say is necessarily true and I don't think I was wrong or ignorant.

The closest one was the reply pointing out that 3500 of the 5300 new lines of code are for unit testing. Which I think is good, but demonstrably shows that SegWit is complex and to call it quite simple is misleading - my original point.

Nah, if you give in then that becomes a validated attack vector. The only reason anyone is paying attention to Jihan Wu is because he is able to coerce the other Chinese miners via "We won't sell to you if you don't represent our interests"
Which is fine, that's their business prerogative. The problem is getting trade to those miners and the Chinese government. To me, a reasonable moral high ground compromise is to just cut China out of the project while their government / enterprises engage in this kind of coercive behavior. People in China who subscribe to Bitcoin will still find a way to participate and succeed. 
There is no reason to export China's problems to the rest of the system.
Instead of breaking or hobbling a working system on the whims of would-be tyrants we should keep the system as pure as possible and push those people as far to the edge of the experiment as possible.

AMY/KYL requirements are going to be stricter than the user who secured their account. Regardless, I wouldn't consider anything in Coinbase secure given the surveillance state. 
If a 3LO wanted to get Coinbase data, they would have Coinbase data. The government just needs a public precedence before they start using it.
It's like when 2 undercover agents collude - one as an officer and another as an 'informant'. The agent protects the identity of the informant who is just another officer but then they can feed whatever info they want into the system and it's legit because it technically came from an informant.
Finally, any data they do collect surreptitiously will need verified against the 'real' data. E.g. "We know what data you have but you need to comply with this request because we need to legitimize it for court" 
It's penalty free for them either way. This is how government prosecution at this level works. It doesn't take a step forward unless it already knows where the foot will land.

This is ignorance or intentionally misleading.
Segwit was an *effective* block size increase with a theoretical max around 4M and realistically ~2M.

It absolutely does not increase the block size.

I'm literally telling you zero miners and zero people with any stake in Bitcoin were interested in the UASF. It had zero incentive for anyone with any wealth stored in Bitcoin in any form.
The only incentive the UASF had was for kids who have zero holdings. 
Segwit, if it became a part of the source code at all, should have been a hard fork. Instead of this stupid fucking pay to anyone bullshit that shoe horns it in. But you probably have no fucking clue what that means. 
Anyway, that's why a lot of us wanted you kids to fork off the network. You're ignorant. You have nfc what Bitcoin is for and you get in the way.
BCC has more support from miners because zero fucking miners cared about the UASF. It was a nice way to get rid of shitty people in the Bitcoin space.
Thinking that because you kids threatened to take your, well you don't have a ball where Bitcoin is concerned, so I guess you just threatened to leave, mattered to anyone other than yourselves is stupid.

I believe you are referencing the maximum tx size wthe number of inputs given the sigops required for verifications?
We are referring to overall blocksize. I believe Segwit2x only allows for 1 tx over 100kB per block. 
So, to get back to the spirit of my rhetorical question - "At what size threshold do blocks become too large for the network to function"
Given Moore's law, a reasonably naive approach would say "Blocks have been 1MiB for X years. Divide X/2 and multiply blocksize by that amount."
But that is still naive. So that's the science that would be nice to see. Instead of just shutting people down and pushing for the settlement approach - which is elegant computer science but ignores engineering completely.

I'm searching for ways to justify what you're saying but I can't. At least, not without coming up with ways to argue against myself because of the ambiguity behind 'anything rash.'
I think blocking a 2MB blocksize for 2 years is rash. I understand why 2MB is not necessary, but I also understand the practicality behind the engineering being preferred over elegant computer science.

@_date: 2017-07-08 17:46:47
It has everything to do with it.
In this limited context it seems to make the point that larger blocks are unnecessary because the first seg2x block may need to be padded by the miner with txs to themselves.
It sounds like a good argument against a size increase but it has more to do with stability and removing ambiguity

It wasn't a demand. It was a tantrum where &lt;20% of the network decided they would make their own fork.

@_date: 2017-07-28 21:33:55
No. All you have to do is read what I wrote. It's pretty amazing.
The UASF had zero support from anyone that mattered.
Who are people that matter? Businesses, Miners, and high stake holders.
The UASF had zero support from those people because there was zero incentive for the economic majority to follow the loudest social voices down their minority path. 
The miners decide which chain is Bitcoin. Not a bunch of angsty kids on reddit running their own version of the client. If the Hong Kong Agreement was not rescued by Barry Silbert (high stakes holder), the miners and the businesses in this space then the UASF would have, supposedly, happened.
That would have put all the people with no or low stake interest in Bitcoin on the same blockchain --- with zero miners. 
Bitcoin has something called difficulty. If you fork from the main chain and you don't lower difficulty you need the miners. If you don't have the miners then you need to Hard Fork to lower the difficulty. 
But that is retarded for obvious reasons (go ahead and ask). So that leads to the next obvious requirement of a proof of work change to protect you (go ahead, ask why this one is obvious too). And now, you are a minority chain (go ahead and ask what that means) with no miners and using a different algorithm at the protocol level. 
That's not Bitcoin. That's tantrum coin.
It's fucking amazing. This all began because Core devs refused to bump up the blocksize and instead wanted a 5300 line code change (3500 lines are unit tests*). Then Core devs decided a hard fork was too contentious. So they shoe horned Segwit into a soft fork and immediately began the 'hard forks are bad' meme. And now, all the fucking lemmings on this subreddit as so fucking dumb that to avoid a hard fork they want to soft fork without realizing their soft fork will require them to hard fork just to survive.
Please, keep blindly throwing faith behind your heroes and ignoring self-education.
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:11:06

Yeah, it's where you invent things about the other person to satisfy you nonarguments about their character and then use that to construe some ideological victory hoping the people reading gloss over the fact that you haven't made any points.
Go ahead and explain how the UASF chain was going to reconcile it's lack of miners with mining difficulty. When it's already been publicly stated miners intend to attack and kill that chain unless it changes its PoW algo - even though one notorious miner already declared they had $100M USD in reserve just for GPUs to attack the minority chain.

That's a bold-faced platitude and lie. I am not a regular in I've posted there once. 
This is plain and simple. Anyone with any sort of interest or significant store of wealth in Bitcoin has an incentive to work together with the other people with stake. The overwhelming majority of whiny kids on reddit don't have stake in Bitcoin.
By it's very nature, the UASF could not attract anyone with significant value to it. That includes every miner and large holder.
Believe it, or not, Bitcoin is run by the wealthiest in Bitcoin. That's why I am here. It's capitalism. This isn't democracy coin. You kids have fiat for that.
Regardless, UASF's lack of miners would have resulted in the chain with the least work - That means its not Bitcoin. Furthermore, it means a hard fork to reduce difficulty - in the least. Likely, it results in a proof of work change. But guess what! That takes 3-6m for ASICs now and guess who makes 'em. At best, UASF is a completely different protocol with a premine equal to the Bitcoin blockchain that kicks the can down the road for 3 - 6 months
Edit: The best possible outcome of a UASF would be getting Reddit out of bitcoin.

This is an indexer. It would work with any blockchain or similar transaction account - it tokenizes data through an interface anyway.
When this indexer finishes you have a dictionary of address:value pairs but you could index any blockchain data you want. This is also distributed. You could, for example, have a distributed FS with 10% of the blockchain on each disk and use this tool to index. 
It's a map reduce architecture and since node is all about microservices you could just spin up as many mappers as you need. On an i7 laptop with 8 cores I indexed about 1% of the blockchain in 15 minutes. That's under ideal I/O obviously that gets slower but I don't address every problem in the post. I mostly smash through to some workable solution.
Also, this blog post may help explain better than I can:

Nah. It's because it was literally sold as a business meme - Write once, run anywhere - in the 90's.
It marketed some features that were 'advanced' for the time but it did them horribly. It's absurdly verbose. Ridiculously verbose. And it's based on classes.
Classical Inheritance is probably the most damaging thing beaten into peoples' heads. And Java is the reason. Classes don't scale. Period. Inheritance is not future proof at all. But we have entire generations of people who think writing Software is like blueprints for a building.
But you provide a good example. Your impulse was that the language was getting out of fashion. No. It's because there are tens of thousands of enterprise-level Software out there written in Java that will always exist and Java is the antithesis of a language that can survive time. 
This is a simple example:
Object -&gt; Animal -&gt; Dog
This would be pretty standard ineritance. Dog isa Animal. Animal isa Object.
Object -&gt; Machine -&gt; Robot
Same deal here. This is where it breaks: Robot Dog. Dog isa Robot? Robot isa Dog? Dog's poop. Does your Robot Dog poop? Does it have the other organic-exclusive features of a Dog? 
Composition is better. Each feature is its own separate function and compose the objects by assembling the functions.
Java's only boon is that if you through enough memory at it, it will eventually work. Java 8 has some cool ArrayList stream features that are basically emulating Javascript higher level functions. I don't recommend anyone bother with Java unless they want to work in a cubicle for eternity. Learn Javascript three years ago. That's the best advice I can give.

And ultimately the business leaders and wealthy individuals in Bitcoin are the ones who have made progress.
This is not a technocracy. Bitcoin is capitalism. Ideas must compete and despite releasing excellent Software they have prevented competition in more than one way -
They are afraid of a large blocksize and don't want to explore hardware solutions to scale transactions so they've put a great deal of effort into blocking larger blocks. If Software scales Bitcoin best, fine. If hardware scales Bitcoin best, fine. But let it compete so the market can figure it out. I don't want to trust their word. I want proof by induction.
They dislike the idea of competing implementations. I'm aware Satoshi called it a waste of time for him but I do not believe decentralization relies on a sole client or that his response was meant for any time other than when he answered. I.e. he was not speaking for the future.
I don't think everyone hates each other as much as media makes it out to be, but hero worship is dangerous and putting a sole group on a pedestal is borderline religion or state-worship. That's not the point of Bitcoin. This is supposed to be a life raft for people trying to escape that level of bullshittery.
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:57:44
In a soft fork the client is backwards compatible. A hard fork it is not backwards compatible. The code required to implement Segwit as a soft fork is not the same as the code required to implement Segwit as a hard fork.

I don't understand Charlie here. It's literally written in that the first block needs to be over 2 meg because that forces the hard fork to happen. It doesn't put the network in a state where it 'could' happen.
E.g. The miners could accept it but it would be possible for a block to be smaller than 1meg. That would mean after the activation there could be a period where the miners who have accepted 2x and those who have not are still on the same chain. 
He has no way of knowing. It's entirely possible the first SegWit2x block is mined almost immediately after the prior block. That's totally possible.

Yeah, the original agreement from Hong Kong was segwit and 2MB blocksize.
When adam back returned from hong kong he was chastised by blockstream for signing as CEO of blockstream and had to retract his signature and resign as an individual. Thus began the 2 year struggle.
Segwit2X is the hong kong agreement. The adults in the room finally got together and made it happen without Core and they've been subject to bullshit marketing/propaganda every step of the way.
Bitcoin is capitalism. Ideas must compete. Core has prevented this despite releasing great Software. This is an economic system, not a technocracy.

It doesn't become hard to run the node by increasing the block size.
Even if it did, there's this awesome thing called Moore's law. We've had a 1MB block size for many years. We could double it every 2 and see no change.

Well, here are a number of reasons why I believe that
1. Miners were never going to run it. UASF chain would not be the chain with the most work. UASF chain is now vulnerable to 51% attacks. Why wouldn't a miner switch chains, pick a block before UASF activation block and outmine the network? Regardless, the UASF chain would still require a change to lower difficulty now. But then you've painted a target on yourself for malicious miners. 
2. The above risk is enough to make the coins on that network low value. At best this creates an ETH / ETC situation. At worse it forces a PoW change.
3. In the event of a PoW change it will still take ~3 - 6 months before ASICs are back on the scene. Who do you think is going to fabricate them?
4. Unrelated to miners, anyone with any significant economic investment in Bitcoin has an interest in going with the majority. The only attraction a UASF has is to individuals with low stake in terms of amount of bitcoin.
5. Like it or not, Bitcoin is designed to force its wealthiest to figure out a way to work together. I would bet bitcoins to dollars that even in the event of a contentious hard fork the minority chain would fail to attract 'brands' or 'names.' Obviously Don Draper and Barry Silbert are going to take steps to protect themselves. But I even believe Roger Ver was only desperately attempting to spark adoption for BU.  
6. Because Bitcoin is defined as the chain with the most work. Not which chain a minority, or even a majority, of users scream over. Bitcoin is a capitalist system. It is designed around competing self-interest. I trust in that greed. A UASF chain is, to me, tantrum chain or Bitcoin-tantrum. Its only economic incentive is for those with a literal lack of stake in the real Bitcoin.
Segwit 2x is [The Hong Kong Agreement](
I can absolutely concede that Core is pursuing brilliant Computer Science. But I don't think it should kill the hardware market that exists. If Software can scale Bitcoin the best, fine. If hardware can scale Bitcoin best, fine. I think that its a shame these ideas haven't been allowed to compete.

A big part of the excitement is the opportunity for those things now exists. We're seeing many attempts to solve these problems happening right now but only the market is going to be able to figure out which work and which don't.
Ultimately it's the guarantee. The removal of trust. The vending machine will give you your rolex because you are able to personally verify the Software running on the vending machine is designed to release the watch at X price. 
The built in safety smart contract checks for transactions in past blocks and verifies the item they purchased registered with an RFID reader smart contract that logs products as they are dropped.
At the least, that system forces the vendor to maintain the RFID reader. But that reader is only valuable if products actually drop - otherwise the funds are refunded anyway. The system is designed such that the only two possible outcomes are you getting what you want or you getting a minor inconvenience of having to wait for a refund. 
This would be way too expensive to implement

If Ethereum goes down a few more times because of its massive success the only thing that will come of that is more development for Eth.
You don't seem to understand how markets work. Bitcoin cannot provide the features Ethereum does. Just because Ethereum is so successful that it is being DDoS'd by people banging on the door to get in doesn't mean those people are going to flip to Bitcoin.
They are going to keep banging on the door to get in. And Bitcoin is nowhere near a place where it could let them in and compete against Ethereum. Bitcoin can't even do its own housekeeping.

Ehhhh I think that relies on social engineering - essentially fighting fire with fire. Both camps are fighting for their version of truth and the ability to force other people to accept their version of truth.
I would rather competing ideas compete. I don't consider a vote based on convincing a majority to run Software to be competition. That's marketing, education, networking, etc and all of those things are easily abused.
This is the same problem US voting has. Each group thinks its more important than the other and it's a giant shouting match that finishes with an even dumber means of forcing other people to go with the 'winner.' 
Real progress would be each camp getting the chance to try it their way with the losers remaining losers and winners moving on to the next battle.

When you made the challenge that Satoshi was acting on principle, not greed, you brought altruism into the discussion. Whether you were aware of it, or not.
The core of your argument is that Satoshi's moral alignment was one you agree with. The point is to not have to worry about morality, altruism or principle. Effectively, the market doesn't need those things because people acting in their own interests are serving all of mankind.

He didn't read the manual. 
It was OP's responsibility to send their money properly. Coinbase can set whatever rules it wants for its business. Your arbitrary and third party opinion counts as an arbitrary and third party opinion. 
You'd think someone with their finger hovering over a $200k button would double check they were doing things properly. But they didn't. They **trust** their bank would magically do it for them. Which is the cancer we make fun of all the time. 
This OP is here complaining because they did the exact thing the banking system forces and conditions them to do. I.e. dumb down and hand over control of your property to other people. 
Why can't they credit his account? Because for whatever reason their business process does not account for overnight ACH, like it explicitly says. If I was a Coinbase customer and I had legit problems because I followed the instructions provided by Coinbase I would be upset that Coinbase would devote resources to this person who did not or could not follow the instructions, before helping me.
Again, you may not be keeping up with current events, but Coinbase is busy with their actual customers. And that's exactly where their priorities should be.

It is a fact that the price of Ethereum has gone from $4 to $400 in a few months.
It is a fact that the number of Ethereum transactions has gone over 300,000
Those are not personal anecdotes. 
It is a fact that Bitcoin has stagnated for two years. It has seen no significant new adoption and no significant change in the transactions it processes. 
You can google your own charts. I hope. But go slow, you might hurt yourself.

This, in spirit, mirrors an analysis done by Jeffrey Tucker some years back.
He explained that as we transition to crypto there will be 'tax conversion days' - essentially the value of crypto will rise and fiat devalues. 
Logically, you want to hold crypto as long as possible. Governments will refuse to accept payment in anything but their sovereign currencies. This means that you should wait until the very last moment to convert crypto into tax currency.
So this prediction means massive transactions on tax days like April wtfever day that is 14th?

Stealing is serious criminal behavior. So I advocate that individuals should do everything they can to protect what they have earned. 
For example, let's say some large gang were able to take over a large geographic area containing where your gran happens to reside. 
Well, the gang might think, when that lady dies we'll shake down all of her relatives as they come to mourn her passing. This way, the other wealthy people in their territory won't be as worried.
Well, if gran decided to buy bitcoin off-exchange through Local Bitcoin or even through an exchange but somehow the coins were not recoverable upon her death... well there's nothing anyone could ever do about that.
See gran will need to make a backup of her keys, and its entirely reasonable for her to ask her tech savvy grand kids to help her. It would be their responsibility to make sure proper backups are made - but hey mistakes are made all of the time. But if those kids were lying the gang would consider it a serious insult and they're likely to send thugs armed with guns to punish the grand kids. 
The gang may ask to know things - like the address of the coins. Which they could get if they were able to coerce the exchange where gran bought her coins - but localbitcoins this is not necessarily true. It's also possible that gran is a secretly a techno-savvy cypher punk and as soon as her grand kids aren't looking she launders her coins through Monero and then back to other bitcoin. Then gran tells her kids she lost them trying to get involved with OneCoin.
