The 'average Joe' is what's needed for Bitcoin to be accepted in the average high street shop on a an average day. Therefore we need Joe.

Transfer me your money and I will send over some goxfantasycoins...possibly...maybe

Not something I would find very useful personally... As soon as gox has gone all prices should be the same really anyway... Id use bitcoinwisdom still for this

Wall Street might bring more investment from big investors/traders but IMO for BTC to grow it needs the more mainstream merchants to use it. For this to happen they need to feel comfortable that the price is relatively stable. Stability would bring greater adoption and in turn growth. 
I'm not saying it's a bad thing but I could see big banks playing the market to purposely cause the volatility that stops it from being adopted on a wider scale.
Just my opinion on how this works :)

Spot on! Something I've been thinking for quite a while now.. 
Cryptocurrency isnt going away but bitcoin will eventually be superseded. All it would take is a government backed entity to launch their own cryptocurrency that the majority of the public would be more comfortable adopting.

Who needs Wall Streets money when you have Dubai money!

Wall Street dollar could cause absolute carnage in the market if it wanted. Any inkling of stability could be shot away in an instant.
Hopefully it will open up the doors to investment in exchanges being built with security and infrastructure equal to banks.
