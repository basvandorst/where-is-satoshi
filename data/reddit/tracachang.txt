Thank you so much ��

Use it over tor, you'll get always the same onion address

Did you check bisq.network?  You can buy and sell using sepa transfers

Because they ever used this symbol it doesn't means it exclusively belongs to them. They have used lot of existing ancient  symbols and not for that reason India or Japan have stopped using them (just to mention some examples). It's just a matter of education and culture

When something it's too good to be true...
Anyway I do not even trust banks I wouldn't even try it
@_date: 2019-03-21 09:09:48
I would appreciate if someone can answer me this questions :
1) When connecting to your own full node, is it used yo send/push tx too? Or only to check balances?
2) The idea of 2sig sounds interesting but since I will use it on my mobile for daily payments, 2fa will be in the same telephone as well. What is the advantage then? If desktop wallet of course it is great as even they steal your seed they need your 2fa but for mobile I still do not see the advantages.
3) When using hardware wallet ledger/trezor you have to create a new wallet as by default both HW are 1sig only, is there any risk with the seed already existing in HW? (I mean if it will be replaced or both can coexist )
Thank you so much

If math is correct I just think it is very cheap, 0.003₿ it is just $25 so yes... very cheap.
@_date: 2019-06-01 09:18:19
I would suggest you to look at green wallet and samourai both are great but I personally prefer samourai wallet.
@_date: 2019-02-04 11:28:56
In both cases you would see your transaction.
Using ledger via website or via electrum you have the same keys, so at the end would be the same. But using electrum will give you higher privacy and coin control feature which it's very important
@_date: 2019-02-15 09:12:33
We, all the slaves should thank our master for allowing us to own the private keys of the f***ing money we earned with our hard work. Thank you master.

You'll fill with an amount and later you'll use it, so let's say you fill $50 once a month and it's enough for all your Starbucks coffees.
Think about it as going to ATM and get cash , you'll need from 10 minutes to 2h and later not need think about time anymore just open your wallet
@_date: 2019-02-19 16:20:57
I would choose buying Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-02-04 21:18:20
Yes of course you can

JPMorgan has launched the mother of shitcoin's...
If Dollar isn't backed by anything this shitcoin is backed by the 0 trust of a bank that has scammed millions of people.
Good work bankster
@_date: 2019-02-11 15:04:57
When you create a wallet you generate a seed with mnemonic words + password. You are in control of your private keys so only you can move your BTC.
I think you confuse with companies like coinbase where you have a "wallet" and they control your private keys for you, in that case if they're malicious they can steal you.
@_date: 2019-02-03 14:02:18
I would advise you to keep BTC in your ledger.
Then with electrum and electrum personal server you'll can do transactions using your full node &amp; hardware wallet
@_date: 2019-02-22 11:38:54
JPM coin is not event an attempt,  its just a shame

If you want a full tutorial step by step search on YouTube "402 payment required". He has great videos covering how to setup a node through Tor and how to setup electrum and EPS.
@_date: 2019-02-11 17:55:10
Don't trust, verify �� 
@_date: 2019-02-07 15:47:50
Running your node over Tor will give you better privacy and your ISP won't even know that you're running a node.
So yes, I think yes it is a good idea.
@_date: 2019-02-11 16:40:20
No it's 0.003% per anonymity set when mixing, there's a coordinator for mixing but how coinjoin works there's no way they can steal your coins.
@_date: 2019-02-05 21:32:09
On Linux you just run a command (pip install) and edit the config file. Didn't find it difficult at all.
But I agree that EPS should be included in the electrum wallet software as option or add-on.
Did you try making this request in the electrum's GitHub?
@_date: 2019-02-23 10:47:54
Blue wallet and shango 
@_date: 2019-02-11 10:06:47
No, when you set up your ledger for the first time you have generates your seed, you backup those words, that's the only thing you need to backup.
When you connect the ledger to electrum's wallet your private keys never leave your device so when you backup wallet.dat there are no private keys in there, as I said they're in your hardware wallet.
To keep more privacy you should generate a new address each time you receive BTC you are right. For that just go to electrum's wallet , click receive and click new.

A financial crisis must happen as this system it's unsustainable, they will delay all they can but they will can not avoid it.
@_date: 2019-02-11 13:04:37
About safety it's open source so you can review the code and about privacy because you can only use it with Tor (it's built in) it has coin control feature and coin join mixing. 
You are welcome
@_date: 2019-02-16 22:25:42
For desktop electrum it's great and you can connect it easily to your full node with EPS.
For Android I really like samourai wallet.
@_date: 2019-02-04 21:22:07
Yes if you have your private key you can sweep to another wallet and you will only pay the transaction fees
@_date: 2019-02-05 22:07:07
Can someone tell me if it has coin control feature? Thanks
@_date: 2019-02-11 10:15:33
No problem!
@_date: 2019-02-11 08:44:19
The best privacy solution would be to run a full node over Tor.
If you can not or don't want to run a full node then the most private alternative would be to use wasabiwallet which is highly focused on privacy and Tor is built-in.
@_date: 2019-02-15 09:05:43
After reading your message I can understand your anger but you can only blame yourself.
They develop an open source wallet and they are offering it for FREE so blaming on them and saying they are responsible that's not fair at all.
@_date: 2019-02-15 10:43:11
We don't need to be financial experts to realize how unsustainable is situation.
They control us because they force us to use their unlimited fiat money which is backed by nothing, they print and create as much as they want and even with all the tools they have they steal so much that countries can't even pay back their debts. O can't imagine other way than a collapse.
@_date: 2019-02-16 08:07:12
You are right, I meant hard to earn/earned with hard work. I'll edit the comment hardly earned to hard earned to avoid confusion

Exactly! As soon as people stop worrying about price and focus on using it a financial revolution  will happen.

Voting is the worst thing you can do as you are legitimating a corrupt system controlled by banksters.

Don't worry they will print more.

If they were restoring the building there must be an insurance, doesn't insurance cover it? If not all then should be interesting to know how much left is needed to help but without transparency I do not agree

Most of people don't understand how money works and they are not even investors of traditional systems like stocks, if they were they wouldn't be surprised as checking most stocks they would see crashes of 90% from all time high.
The real deal of crypto is self sovereignty but people have to be educated, some they will search and learn by themselves and the rest will be forced to learn when Fiat system crashes and they loose all.
@_date: 2019-04-15 10:27:08
I have deleted the last message because wrong amount of invoice
@_date: 2019-04-09 11:49:56
Mmmm no, it should be you who forfeit your right to complain since you have voted them and agreed with their political intentions.
Me since I know that all it is corrupted,  they do what they want and they can change laws whenever they want, I choose to not vote. I have to suffer as the rest of people  what they impose me and and what they steal me but  at least I do not consent and when less people vote more evident will be that we are in a dictatorship.
The problem of this dictatorship (even if every time it is more clear) is that a lot of people still believing that they are free,  imagine a slave who firmly beliefs to be free... isn't that great for masters?
@_date: 2019-04-17 12:57:36
Correct and totally right but even they are capable to pay we should not forget that they have an insurance too. So between donations,  insurance and benefits of entrance fees... what a business
@_date: 2019-04-17 13:01:31
Was a work of art and a business too, they get the benefit so when has to be restored they should pay for it.
@_date: 2019-04-15 10:33:31
Done !

Have you tried mixing with wasabi?  Curious to know

Give me an invoice to pay you back the 500 extra
@_date: 2019-04-09 11:57:04
Since they rule our lives with their Fiat money to use an alternative method which they can't control, it is for sure the most disrutpive and effective action you can do against governments

I've read another news about hamas where he received an insignificant amount in btc compared to donations in usd. Usd should be banned in order to fight terrorism

People backup seed-words by encypting them and making copies in SD cards, USB sticks... or using steel-plates to protect it from damages.
I prefer the approach of Bitfi since your seed will not be stored any place, just remember your passphrase and salt and you are ready to go.

"we shouldn’t expect to see the investment bank get more involved with crypto until it has solid backing"
Yeah the same solid backing as Fiat and banks have ��?
