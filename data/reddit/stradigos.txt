I support a blocksize increase. I understand the concerns, but OP is right. We need to wake up. Doing nothing isn't productive. 
Nay sayers, what's your plan then? I'll listen and honestly consider it. We have to do something.

So are we going to see a price drop soon then or should I think about buying now you think? Feels like a correction should happen soon...

Getting into crypto while you're living pay check to pay check is dangerous, friend. You would be better off finding ways to consistently make more money (like a higher paying job) than investing heavily in bitcoin (or any coin) as a means of generating wealth.

Bought before fork and curious how to cash in bch for btc? I thought this couldn't be done? Aren't the keys good for either? Not sure how that translates to cashing in one for the other.

What's causing this rally?

I know some of those words...

Had no idea! Haven't been able to stay current on things lately. Thanks for the info.

There's this secret society that you can only get into if you have a ton of updoots.

With 2x looming I don't know what there is to miss out on unless plans have changed again. Much uncertainty ahead. Just suprised to see it rally like this ahead of all that. I heard it's because the dollar got weak this week but I'm not sure how to check that.
