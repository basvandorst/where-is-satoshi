Ahh sorry abt that.
Yeah to your question it represents the idea that higher fees = result of higher volumes = result of higher prices.  Therefore it's only reflective of the underlying support of the technology.  
Frankly I would fee quite skeptical of something like litecoin where the fees are lower - almost a kind of "wheres the catch?" type thing.  I'd rather pay the higher fee of BTC because it seems more legitimate.  And I think the fee speaks thereof.

Have they vowed never to speculate again?  What do they do if the price declines 50%?  Never touch it again?

For those 8 blocks and 23,000 transactions it has worked fine, but has been exorbitantly and prohibitively expensive.  Now that leaves 270k that are (still) waiting.

@_date: 2017-12-10 18:43:21
Sorry did not mean as inflammatory.  I just think most of the point of bitcoin is the idea of the future.  The utility of it as a means of transaction has never been reliably demonstrated - BUT with a 1,000% price gain despite that , it must not matter.  Therefore I think that the real value comes from everyone buying it ad infinitum.  Not necessarily buying real-world things or worrying about transaction fees.

So you're bullish bitcoin in the same way that you're bullish your abilities at the roulette table?  Is that really an investment strategy now?
The stock market is no gamble.  You are taking a direct investment in a dividend-paying equity portion of a company, with a balance sheet, earnings and cash flows, related over the long-run to real GDP growth.  Does this sound like bitcoin to you?
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:12:11
The whole ethos of these forums is predicated on the fact that cryptos are an inherently superior transaction system compared to current infrastructure like Visa/SWIFT/Mastercard.

The dollar is worth 1/4th of a Bigmac, 1/60th of a barrel of crude oil, or 1/4 of a bushel of Wheat.
Why is there such hate on the USD when inflation has been a consistent and stable &lt;2% for 30 years?  Wage and welfare growth has been much above that for much of the same time.  So in real terms it has been perfectly stable - not sure what warrants such a skepticism of a proven stable system.

Wrong, $59mln notional average in 4days on CME.  Open interest is less than half that.  
Considering average cash Bitcoin volume is roughly $3.4bln, futures are an irrelevant drop in the bucket.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:57:46
The thing that drives relative values on fx pairs is interest rate differentials, or at least forward expectations thereof.  This is the most fundamental and basic driver of FX pairs. Ie if Euribor is trading 30 bps cheaper than the appropriate Eurodollar rates, I'm incentivized to put on the carry and short EURUSD.  
Bitcoin has no interest rates thus it is no actual currency.
Do you understand what I am saying?  I hope an expert like yourself can educate a neophyte like me on something forward rate differentials and their effect on currency values.

I use my own coin called Valuetoken that I invented as a store of value.  How is Bitcoin superior to that as a store of value?  It can't get stolen and never goes down in price.
Or does store of value in this case mean "something that never stops going up in value ad infinitum"?
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:00:35
I'm not saying I'm an expert (far from it) but just speaking from my general experience , that's the pattern I've noticed!

And if that's the case, I have a token called Coolcoin that "I'm working on" and it will be great one day.  Where's my money?!
The coin called Fucktoken still has a market cap of $380,000.  Think about that.
That's real money allocated to something that promses nothing beyond being a joke.  That's someones house sitting in something that fundamentally is just as usable as this Bitcoin idiocy.

Again why the defensiveness/aggression?
If I buy a house from you via bitcoin , u have to convert that to Euros to buy your food and ultimately sustain your existence.  Let's not forget all taxes are collected in real money.  Which is indeed the inevitability that touches every transaction on earth.

I think you're asking the wrong questions.  The right question is what if the US EMBRACES bitcoin legislation. 
For instance, look at the 1967 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies.  Governments realized that something as grand and gamechanging as Celestial Bodies cannot be regulated.  
Bitcoin is similar in that way.  I wouldn't be surprised if governments are working on an international treaty similar to those of the 1960's.  A friend of mine works at the UN and he's been drafting an amendment to that very treaty - so far the EU is pushing hard to deregulate Bitcoin .  They know they can't stop God.

Message to the mods. 
Why are you labelling this as FUD?  Is trying to have a discussion on the fundamental drivers of value on a financial instrument, somehow negative now?
Why is this frowned upon and flagged?  Should we not label the bullish threads as "hysteria"?  Or something equally pejorative?  
Seems a strange standard.

If everyone does this, the fees should remain low!
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:07:10
You realize that miners have been incentivized to slow the network and juice out as many fees as possible since Day 1?  It's their business model and raison d'etre -  when their power costs increase over time, they only have one choice on the opposing revenue side of things.
This is not an attack, but rather a feature or "perk" of Bitcoin's functionality if you are naieve.
It has been inherently built into Bitcoin structure from the start.  They are squeezing all you fools with dreams of infinite risk-free returns - and if you can't see how, I suggest you do some research without the rose-tinted glasses.

Yeah that's what's really worrying me here.  Especially if you're a merchant, I can imagine there's going to be a growing degree of risk aversion from that regard.  
At the end of the day, they do have to transfer to fiat to pay taxes.  Or pay for their raw ingredients / COGS in fiat as well.
Creates a lot of risk which seems to be a big thorn in this project's side until the transactions speed up.

I think high fees reflect high demand, which is why it's justifiable to pay such fees.  If not then it only discredits the whole movement.

My private Valuetoken always increases by 1% per day relative to the USD. I consider this the best investment that I have made but unfortunately I cannot open this store of value to any other investors.
EDIT: it's not a steady 1% mind you.  Sometimes it goes down 1% or even 2% but the average increase is roughly 1% every day without fail.
In this regard I find it much safer than Bitcoin.  And at least I don't have to worry about other market participants or malicious attacks.

Futures are much too illiquid for an ETF to be based on. Even $10mln of investment would account for over 1/3rd of the Open Interest, overwhelming any semblance of liquidity on the futures market when the ETF begins back-to-back hedging.  That allows for massive dislocations, poor fills, and broken contracts.  All of which undermine consumer confidence and break the security/market further.
The ETF will fail as fast as the futures have.

@_date: 2017-12-10 22:56:19
Yes, well done.
Finally someone thinking in a logical way.  And well done at that.  Higher fees means no one can transact in bitcoin, which means that bitcoin cannot actually be used for its intended purpose.  Is that bullish?
Store of value in this case = waiting for someone else to continue buying after you've bought = not a real asset or store of value.
I really appreciate your comment as it's the first one I've seen that logically approaches and skeptically reviews the farce that is occuring before our eyes.
Thank you sir!

Bullion at the end of the day has net lost significant, and I mean SIGNIFICANT real purchasing power over the last 40 years.
And at least bullion has the world's longest backtest (4.000 years) as far as people deeming it worth something.  And even that I find weak.
In the very least, your "end of the world hedge" of bullion has value in that you can beat someone over the head with a block of it and steal their food.
If power goes out and the world ends, where's your blockchain then?  Which is ultimately what you're hedging against with something as stagnant and disfunctional as these last-resort stores of value.

@_date: 2017-12-26 16:45:02
No I would not because you have to factor in a liquidity discount on all of your holdings.
Stock market in a broad index = reasonably liquid and a 1bln liquidation shouldn't be too hard.  Again depends on which stocks.
Real estate worth $1bln?  Sure, worth it on paper, but good luck liquidating that in a reasonable amount of time without taking a decent haircut on the asking prices.
Bitcoin worth $1bln?  No one has ever sold this much, EVER.  Have you seen the transaction times / costs / complaints from people just trying to sell $100 on GDAX.  It's a total joke.
Now let's see these Winkleclowns try to cash in and see what they're really worth.  They have no exit strategy, it's very clear.  Real estate and stocks have a tried and true liquidation market that allows you to convert into cash.  Bitcoin has nothing.

The US dollar?
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:54:36
The US is a single economy , and the EU is not.  The US has single control over its own fiscal and monetary policies (the 2 arms with which governments try to mitigate the economic cycle).  EU nations have control over their fiscal policies but not their own monetary policies.
Greece and Germany are two different economies.  Because Greece needs to live under a unified monetary policy, they cannot adapt their currency and monetary bases to combat declines in the business cycle.  That is exactly equivalent to having a gold standard (Greece cannot print Euros in the same way that a Gold-based country cannot just "create gold"). This is why Greece has struggled with extremely high unemployment and poverty, as inflation numbers have been negative for the last 3 years roughly.
Deflation clearly is not a good thing as it does not incentivize investment.  Thats why gold standards (and by corollary bitcoin standards, whatever that wld be) do not work.
And yes I remember QE.  It ended in the US over 3 years ago.  Just exactly what havoc has it unleashed on the US economy over the last 8 years?

Liquidity on futures is next to nil, they won't use it.

Its been 6 whole days since the last rally... starting to feel pretty hopeless here.  Investing is supposed to be easier than this , no??

I meant USD as a metaphor for any currency thats in its own country. Of course this all applies to BRL in Brazil.....
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:16:51
Your problem is that your tried to move Bitcoin to another wallet.  The point is to stay with your holdings and watch the price go higher.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:13:50
Its not lord of the rings dude. Theres no line to hold.  The only thing gonna bust is clowns like you!
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:49:21
You better be careful using numbers and logic, apparently it's highly frowned upon here.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:29:01
The point of bitcoin/blockchain is not to buy things and transact.  The point is to hold it and make money riskfree.  This is the future!

Global poverty has declined 70% in the last 25 years.  Where do you get your numbers?
It doesn't sound like fiat currency is doing a terrible job to me.

We have a decentralized currency society.  So I would reckon no??  The whole point is to "get past the government", isn't it?

The rate of wage GROWTH is stagnating.  Ie the yearly increase of wages is indeed slowing slightly.  But it is growing, year by year, every year.  You are mathematically looking at the wrong derivative.

Exchange doesn't take positions.  They collect fees.  The exorbitant profits that miners are making are now finding competition.  These are the only winners in this scheme.

I'm posting with you! Amen brother.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:36:58
In bitcoin terms it's also not very relevant as well.  As long as you have the privilege to transact in Bitcoin - just go with it!

Please examine the frequency of recessions/busts during the gold standard/non-fiat/pre-Fed era.  Then compare that to the frequency of recessions in the fiat currency era.

Again this sounds great but it doesn't answer any of my questions. What does "tamper proof blockchain" even mean if you can't even use it for anything? 
Think about the basics and try to look past the buzzwords.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:35:37
Show them the chart and it will be obvious that the price will continue going up forever.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:57:46
Can you answer any of my questions? I am just curious.

I've tried to quantify this using a random-forests/ML algorithm basis Google Trends data and I have to agree.  I've only received 40 whatsapps about it in thr last week (out of average 3,000 normal for me), so even this metric also seems to agree as well.  From my research, algorithms, and quantifications, you're on to something.

I would just re-evaluate after 1 trading session.  Probably worth burning some of the midnight oil tho!

The average of those numbers is 2.49%.  I am sorry that I was wrong by 49 basis points.  You are right. 
 These 49 excess bps have indeed destroyed humanity and civilization as we know it.  Bitcoin is indeed bullish.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:44:55
That guy u/LeftHello seems to be making a reasonable point that once futures launch,  BTC should also go up in value in the same way all commodity futures have over the past few years.  Seems reasonable his logic?
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:52:45
I just pay more transaction fees and it gets thru no problem.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:41:26
Would it include exotic derivatives pricing such as correlation swaps and variance options with binary strike knock-ins?  Really the only reason to have a Bloomberg...
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:59:12
So everything is perpetually going to rise in price, I'm probably better off buying something that is super cheap now and hasn't taken off yet.  Imagine if Corn can get a rally like BTC has seen over the past year!
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:52:13

The thing about option  is that net/net there is no bitcoin demand creation. If i send you my rent money then I buy bitcoin and sell it to you.  One sell cancels the buy.  Then you "buy bitcoin from me" and you sell it to someone else.  Hence every buy is cancelled by a sell.  Therefore there is no demand growth from that perspective and does not necessarily raise the price.
The only net demand coming in is from people who want to buy and hodl.  These people are buying in order to sell to someone at a higher price.  This requires an essentially infinite constant inflow of new "suckers" in order to sustain the profitability of the hodlers.
A market, as a whole, cannot all make money ad infinitum.  Stocks are different as they have a fundamental dividend payout dependent on human progress vis a vis GDP growth and innovation.  With no such mechanism in BTC, any hodler needs an increasing amount of buyers to keep coming in and sustain the inflows.  As a result, the market as a whole cannot generate net profits for the entire market, leading to its inevitable collapse.
It's extremely interesting from a "complete misallocation of capital and effort" perspective.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:54:35
Yeah who knows these days... could take weeks , I do not know how much fees I paid for it!

The reason that the Eurozone has struggled is because it is operating under a shared currency.  Different economies with different growth rates and different demographics.  As a result no one country has control of their own currency.
This is in effect an artificial gold standard.  Which is (wait for it).... DEFLATIONARY!  What else is deflationary? Supposedly bitcoin.
See the parallels in the problems there?

Your money is not in shares, it is backed up and guaranteed by the US govt.

Will try to respond to all 3 in turn:
1) Futures always replicate exactly what the market expects the future value of that asset to be.  I.e. if March BTC futures are trading at $20,000, then it means the asset will be worth $20k  YES OR YES.  If not then there are arbitrage opportunities.  
2) Hardly any serious participant in a futures market utilizes a serious variant of risk management.  Risk management was a concept employed by the banks of Wall Street up until the 2008 crisis (remember how that worked out??).  They no longer use this as it only depresses trading profits, especially in cryptos where there is simply too much money to be made.
3) Price discovery is a process that is occuring at every moment of every day.  It's a core reason why Bitcoin, in its immense rally, has "discovered" why it is so innately bullish.  Therefore futures markets will only aid in determining that innate truth (read: it won't go down).  Volatility has only risen in BTC over the last year which can only be considered a good thing.
Tried my best, let me know.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:46:18
Took a good 20 years tho so I'm just wary of the timeline here.
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:29:56
Would recommend only selling options tho.  Lot of vol arb funds are active in the space scalping gamma against their delta hedges.  40 point slippage against your bid/offers can make the theta / delta optionality a bit rich.  Also vega strategies ensure the mgmt of rho positions a bit trickier.

I bot on $200 of 5% margin at $25 and haven't sold a single coin.  Living the good life !   I've been actively selling BTC volatility against it in order to finance the margin calls.  Much easier to manage
