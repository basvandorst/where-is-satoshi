You know the btc mod logs are public, right? Not seeing your ban... weird.

What if they deny your request to open a payment channel? Isn't freezing you out of the network effectively freezing your funds?

I don't think your analogy really works in this case, but if it's used cars you understand;  What if a popular used car dealer won't let me list my used car on their marketplace, are they not limiting my exposure to as many buyers as possible? What if they are doing that because we both have a Tesla for sale and they want to sell theirs first?

Bummer, I was really starting to like tshirt guy. :(
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:05:04
Humm? Are you saying no one will deny opening a channel with anyone?
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:19:02
Well, as noble as that is, I don't think the world is quite that black and white. Say what you will, but in my experience, people are at times cooperative and reasonable and at other times presumptuous and greedy. When it comes to making money, especially in finance, I always have to be aware of greed - it would be foolish not to.

Thank you!

Sounds promising.

Hey, actual question. I just looked at the LN whitepaper and did a search for "privacy". The word "privacy" is found exactly 0 times. Do you know where is it written that intermediate nodes will or will not know the source/destination of transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:47:20
So, convince him to use a more *trustworthy* node?
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:56:28
Not really. My concern is the logical conclusion of any network; There will be hubs, and switches and routers, oh my!
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:44:17
I'm really having trouble following you. I'm trying to illustrate the control popular nodes (hubs) could have. You're talking about dirty kleenex to illustrate, what? That it's a dog eat dog world? That people look out for  Then, I think we're saying the  same thing.

Ok - but the guy I buy my tshirts from only has an open channel with the node that has denied me a channel. What do?
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:40:29
Ok, so I have to do some investigation to find a node that has a connection to the node that denied me. That might not be too much work for someone who knows that's what they need to do. What if we reverse it. What if it's TShirt guy that's getting censored? Now i have find a new route to my tshirt guy - or maybe find a tshirt guy that's still connected? In either case, you're trusting these nodes to be good network actors.
If a node dosn't know where the money is from, or where it's going, that brings up another question. What if the censoring node denied me because I was up to no good, using their channel to buy drugs or weapons. Now I can just route through a "proxy" and still use their payment channel to do my nefarious deeds against their will? I mean, technically isn't their money part of my illegal transaction? Kind of like a TOR exit node, but with money instead of packets?

Dude, a network? That’s crazy! 
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:09:22
You're right - I didn't put a ton of thought into forming that. However, I think the analogy was broken before I got to it.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:01:45


Wait, is this right? You're saying intermediate nodes don't know the source and destination of a transaction, but they are using their money and charging a fee to route it?
Forget the tshirt... I'm going into the money laundering business. ;)
