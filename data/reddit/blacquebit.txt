I save 25% of my net income now. I split it evenly between gold and BTC.
@_date: 2014-08-28 14:25:21
The key is not how much BTC they all receive, its introducing it to 71k people in one shot. With local govt and business support, this is HUGE.

I'm a newbie to bitcoin. I'm very sorry this happened. My observation, re: all the various bitcoin scams: it's as if, because it's digital currency, these scammers think their thievery doesn't have an effect on real people in the real world. Every time I see something like this, it reminds me of Corp/market scams in EVE Online. I hope the public sees that the issue lies with one person's dishonesty, and doesn't blame bitcoin. Digital currencies are here to stay, IMHO. I wish all former Neo and Bee employees well. And "Danny Brewster", wherever you are..die in a fire. Slowly.

I don't mean "you" personally re: masses accepting it..but I thought that was the point? Why bother with bitcoin if only a few thousand people or so worldwide use it? To me the bitcoin movement is about providing a viable alt to fiat. fuck the fed and so forth. I linked a thread below that answers some of what the concerns are in THIS thread. I do share those concerns..but I don't think that this is some NSA head-fake. I think these guys have to comply with the law in the areas they operate in, and that's the reason. If you read the other thread, you see that in canada, for instance their machines work justlike someof you want them to. so, I don't think they're up to anything nefarious. I think they are doing what they have to to comply with local/state/federal law. just my 2 bits..

Don't have the BTC yet, wont be in my wallet for a few days apparently. but I understood mycelium to be pretty safe storage. Am I wrong about that? Also, why does it take coinbase so long to deliver them?
@_date: 2014-06-29 02:11:13
What I experienced today was not slow, expensive, or inconvenient..just the opposite. I understand bitcoin just fine..but, as I said, if you want the masses to accept it, use it, you have to present it in a way that everyone is familiar and comfortable with. Everyone knows what an ATM is, and how to use one. I agree(I could've sworn I posted that I would prefer anonymity) that anonymity is best.If you want bitcoin to remain niche, then, cash transactions/localbitcoins.com/etc etc..but, if cryptocurrency is to be a viable replacement/alternative to the current fiat system, you gotta ease people into it with a familiar product. ATM's fit the bill. Now, if the argument is that the whole bitcoin thing is just a government oke-doke to trick us into giving up our biometric info..why bother debating anything..anyone who believes that should just walk away from bitcoin and cryptocurrency completely.

some of that is answered in this thread..
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:41:46
 very classy.  After thinking about this..that article is poorly written, yes, but also rings false. That quote from the cop is bad writing..from a script. He didn't say that. "Satoshi's" quote about not being involved..that's generic, "leave me alone" language. Rings false. This "reporter" is trying for fame..but this article is about as real as reality TV.
This guy isn't Bitcoin's Satoshi. He might be playing along for some reason,maybe being paid to do so. Who knows. What I do know is this reporter put this guy's life in danger to further her career. And for that, she should be destroyed professionally.

I'm just getting my feet wet with bitcoin, but what my plan is, is go 50/50 BTC/gold and silver. I'll be buying the gold with btc, probably through amagi metals(they accept btc for purchase), taking physical delivery, and just keep splitting my investment cash that way. That way, if my coins get hacked, my exposure is less. And I think both BTC and precious metals are going up. We'll see.
@_date: 2014-06-29 01:51:09
True, this is not anonymous in any way..but does it have to be? I would prefer anonymity, but, if bitcoin is going to be accepted by the masses, it must be accessible. very few people are gonna buy/use it if every time they want to buy/sell you have to turn into a secret agent, complete with clandestine meetings and so forth. As far as I see, this is the best way. If anyone has a better way..please tell us.

will do, thanks!!

Good stuff, Coinbase.

No prob, will use search next time..

Me too. Hollywood ca.

Donated. It's the first time I've actually used bitcoin for anything. Feels good :)
@_date: 2014-06-27 16:40:45
I'd put 20% in bitcoin, 20% gold, and the rest ustrippers
@_date: 2014-08-21 14:37:35
This pretty ballsy, actually, and smart. If you look at what's happening with the BRIC countries, the alliance s they're forging..its clear to see USD is on its way OUT.
Bitcoin and gold are the only investments I trust. Go 'head wit yo baaaad self, Amagi..

I live in L.A. and would love to use BTC for subway sammiches :)

Awesome. I'm in L.A., and I'd day trip down to TJ just to use the ATM. Looking forward to this. Good stuff :)
@_date: 2014-06-29 14:53:13
the closest one to you is in TJ. link: 
@_date: 2014-06-29 00:52:46
It's awesome!! I honestly couldn't believe it was that easy. Yeah, check it out ASAP :)
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:14:29
I just signed up on coin.mx bit are they legit? It almost seems too easy..
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:59:09
Terrifying story, but when things like this happen, it ups BTC'S street cred. In the back of my mind, It occurred to me the whole crypto currency movement might be a feint to get everyone on a cashless and government - controlled currency, that control being clandestine.
I now am convinced that bitcoin is real..
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:40:50
I can't even..she is trying to defend the indefensible. She lied. Period. And Newsweak(yes that was on purpose) doesn't give a shit. If you didn't know that mainstream journalism is dead, know it now.
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:48:48
What this reporter did was disgusting. I fear for Satoshi's life.
