coinbase are digging information from your account details and doing lord knows what with it. I would recommend something other than coinbase. They sent me a message to my main crypto email with the name of the other person on my joint bank account rather than using my name. that shows that they are digging information from our accounts don't know why they are doing it but they are. just a heads up and wanting to spread the information. Really wish I hadn't gotten into crypto at this point.
