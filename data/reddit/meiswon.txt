Bigger block sizes. That's it.
A large percentage of the BTC community  (developers who have been there from the beginning and don't receive a salary) raised their concerns, but the supporters (a few people with a lot of BTC and some miners...Roger Ver, Jihwan Wu) didn't care and said they were going to fork the coin into a Segwit2X coin. Some exchanges even sold Segwit2X futures.
The price of BTC fluctuated...and then on the day of the planned fork they cancelled it and sold a huge amount of BTC and pumped BCH. A lot of people panicked and followed suit.
So BTC fell to around $6000 and BCH skyrocketed to around $3800...and it seemed like they were right about which one was the real bitcoin but look at the prices now.
Now this guy is sorry after contributing to this nonsense.

I remember when the SegWit2x fork was supposed to happen and it was a huge deal and a lot of people were extremely concerned and confused about the future of bitcoin because of this guy and people like him...and people who listened to him probably lost a lot of money. 
No replay protection immediately got my attention (even though I'm not an expert) and it seemed shady, even before I looked deeper into it...then I looked deeper and it bothered me even more...and yet these people pushed on with their agenda.
I can respect anyone who admits that they're wrong but the way the SegWit2xers pushed their agenda back then...and their attitude towards anyone who even questioned their motives is something that doesn't just go away because of an apologetic tweet.
So fine, he's sorry. But it's easy to apologize after the fact, when you were so clearly wrong. It doesn't fix the damage that you did at the time, even though things have kind of worked out. That's what everyone on CNN and FOX news does. Just spew your nonsense and influence people's thoughts and emotions. Then when it's proven that you're spectacularly wrong...just apologize. 
This guy can be forgiven but his credibility is gone.

He's older and his business is selling gold and it's made him a billionaire. Of course he feels that way. Ignorance is not the same as foolishness.

Incorrect. There is a huge crash coming, like in 2007, which was caused by the housing market. This time the US dollar will tank, so gold will have value. The US dollar will not.

Absolutely. Look at the auto industry. The government just printed money to bail them out. Printing money just devalues the dollar, so it's a like a hidden tax on anyone who has US dollars. Is the American auto industry thriving now? Is Detroit better off? Where did all of that money go?

This is reason  I might believe that they're spreading FUD in order to buy more for themselves but that's it.

That and he was born into a family that was born in a place with a lot of oil...so of course he's an expert in fintech

What if indeed...What if you actually had balls?

it has to happen eventually and it will lead to mainstream adoption...price spikes then corrections and pullbacks then back to normal growth

Your argument is logical and it sounds nice but I'm guessing you're American? Logic and "the good of the people" isn't the Chinese government's main concern. You're looking at this from a Western point of view. Rich Chinese want to get their money out of the country and Bitcoin is a great way to do that. The government just shut it down.

Satokens is an excellent name for a coin.

That's a great reply. Everyone else (including me) just shat all over this post. But when I 1st decided to invest, I remembered Warren Buffet's rule  DON'T LOSE MONEY. So do your research, and invest as much as you can afford to lose or don't invest anything. Once you make your decision, go with it.
