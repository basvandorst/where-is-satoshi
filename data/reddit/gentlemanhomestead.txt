Can you help me get educated about risks?  Like I said I know a lot about coinbase's vault. I know a lot about the Ledger Nano S. I know a lot about what a paper wallet is where I write stuff out and keep that paper somewhere very safe............. 
I just don't know enough about the middle man.  I need to set up an electronic wallet on my computer or mobile device that sits in between Coinbase and my hardware or paper wallet.  What if my device is corrupted and I don't know it during the transfer?  What if there's a trojan virus lurking in there copying my key strokes or something?  
That ignorance is what's holding me back. :)

Sorry for the  but what is the "best" usage of something like the Ledger Nano S?  
Is this a one-and-done item?  For example, say I get to one bitcoin (or some other arbitrary amount I decide upon), and I want to move it to the NanoS?  
1) Do I set that device somewhere safe and never use it again, until I want to sell or purchase something?  And as I accumulate more bitcoin I repeat this process with a new Nano S?
2) Or whenever I feel like moving new bitcoin off Coinbase, I plug my one and only Nano S in and use it over and over again?
I guess I'm asking, how many keys does it hold?  And if it can be used for many transactions, is it safe to do so?

I don't yet know how to do that. I've read and studied a ton to understand the technical side of bitcoin and blockchain and what they are..., I feel ignorant and really need to ramp up quick on the real world "How" of the best way to interact, buy, sell, hold bitcoin.

Thanks.  What amount do you personally think it is wise to get a hardware wallet?  Am I correct in assuming you think almost no amount (that one plans to hold) is wise to keep in coinbase's "vault"?

The red graph is a depiction of the number of "Sells" at certain price points.
The green graph is a depiction of the number of "Buys" at certain price points.
In your example screenshot, there is a relatively large number of "Sells" for $4085.10.  That's what that large horizontal red line is (called "a wall").

Shouldn't I have to set up a regular Patreon payment to see wisdom like this?

I appreciate this.  I'm in the US and keep my (meager) bitcoin holdings in coinbase's vault, since I plan on holding long term.  I have 2FA turned on everywhere I can.  
I've researched hardware wallets and understand how the Ledger Nano S in particular works.  I'm just really nervous about the process of moving from coinbase into a Nano.  I'm fairly technically minded and try to keep up on things, but who knows what might be lurking on my laptop or phone that might corrupt the transfer?  Any advice?
