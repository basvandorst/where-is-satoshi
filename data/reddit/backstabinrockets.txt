ok then that is indeed a different situation. in that case, just do what feels comfortable. but $200 sounds like a fairly priced investment.
if you want to do the full $700, do it in pieces, that way you hedge against price drops, and don't miss out on too much if it goes up a bit. when i feel like investing a large amount, taking a break to do the maths always helps.

it's not exactly overnight or sudden tho right? it happens at a set interval of blocks. so the miners should have plenty of warning to upgrade their hardware, or whatever they decide to do with the information that a halving is coming.
but it still could be a rough transition when it does occur, especially when difficulty is high. i expect fees would have to provide an incentive to sustain the network for a bit. unless better hardware is invented before then

the best thing to do in this situation is do the math.
if you want to put in $200 right now, that will net you ~ 0.0259BTC. if the price goes up $300 to $8000, you will get 0.025BTC. inversely if it drops $300, you will get ~ 0.027BTC.
to get the same ~ 0.027BTC at current price, it would cost you $208. or at $8000 price, $216.
i find it helps to look at it this way, because its easy to fall into the trap of "but its a $300/600 increase", forgetting that only applies to whole coins. but $8/16 difference is very small in the big picture, and not worth the stress of thinking you're missing out on a deal.
hope this helps

in general, excellent advice. but it sounds like this user may be a young person that still hasn't moved out.
i wish i had spent all, or at least some, of the money i made during high school/college on BTC instead of just wasting it on girlfriends and beer...

it sounds like to me if you are looking to throw a large percentage or all of your savings into BTC, and are worried about current price vs 8000, you may be afflicted with FOMO, or fear of missing out.
in this case, fear of missing out on "the wave that will make everyone in this sub millionaires".
personally i think that it would be a good idea to step back from bitcoin for a moment and think on what the smartest move is with your capital from a less emotional standpoint. because even if $200 becomes $100,000 in 10 years, its still important to weigh that against what $200 can get you in the short run. namely food, rent, medical care, etc.
that being said, it's your money and your situation. the only thing i know are just 2 numbers you wrote here. but i hope if you are in fact in an emotional place about BTC that may push you to take bigger risks, that this might help.

the state getting its taxes &gt; "democracy"

Applies to any call for state anything. But it is weird to see it proposed on a subreddit dedicated to the most free market system in existence (except where it touches the state, eg: exchanges).
If people have a problem with 2X supporting exchanges, just move

why not?

Amount of attention really only applies in the current situation. I'm 100% certain that if bitcoin takes off there will be companies that can either manage the actual blockchain holdings of customers and give them "promissory notes", perhaps in a digital form; or give out credit to be paid in Bitcoin to both parties - like how credit cards work today.
I know "bank" is kind of a naughty word around this sub, but the basic functions of banks were developed in the mostly free market to meet the needs of transactions. And if you want to keep Bitcoin p2p, then keep your keys. But who knows, maybe one day paying merchants direct in BTC will be seen the same as buying a TV at BestBuy and slapping down 1oz of gold on the checkout counter.

you guys are both right - the banks are essentially a department of the state under the FED at this point. so i think you guys are saying banks vs state is to blame, but theyre the one in the same in the scope of this conversation.

how? the way i understand it, it's all self reporting and if you're willing to spend the time and transaction fees you can hide as much btc as you want. there's no PII linked to btc addresses

Which app is this? I use one called Bitcoin Checker but it doesn't use Material Design which annoys me. This one looks slick

If you're worried about Bittrex 0.25% fee, then you're probably looking for GDAX, which has 0% fee limit orders.
But if there's anyone else out there just looking for a good low-fee exchange I would recommend Gemini. You can trade your balance before the ACH clears and it only has a 0.25% fee. I recommend Gemini to new users over Coinbase.
