Margin call is pretty boring for a movie, but its more informative. A lot more aspects of the problem where explained and brought up than in the big short. Especially the problem that doctors, bridge engineers an rocket scientists (the jobs named in the movie) are working on wall street for the quick big money. Instead of using their skills and abilities to actually create something for society.

That's why I never told my mom. Bought at 500 before the 1200 bubble.  Never sold. She would have been angry about things she doesn't understand for the last few years

youtube demonetizes political right leaning floggers, blocks video's of antifa assaults and put pro trump videos lower in search results.

It can only go down with less adoption and people jumping the boat to other criptos at current state. Something has to change. Developers and influencers have been debating and smearing each other for at least 3 years now. The only result is stalling the necessary development, which created the shady centralized fork bitcoin cash.

Bcash is literally bitcoin, only on another chain with different rules.Pre fork transactions have their coins on both chains.
 It's not an altcoin with a different chain.

There where people who wanted commit suicide back in 2014 who bought at the 1200$ peak. Very good that you're stating this.

Why is that? you mean only with unsecured private keys?
I also red 3 years ago you need to transfer all the coins, otherwise the remaining coins will be transferred to another unknown key, but I'm not sure if that's still the case and if it depends on the application you use to read them out.

You can create a paper wallet and store it in a dry dark place. For back up te key on a usb stick stored somewhere else. Creating and reading the keys on a device w/o internet connection. I used a PiperWallet for all that. Thats how I did it pre trezor and still have some.
