From the FAQ in the sidebar;
As an investment, is the Bitcoin a sure thing?
Bitcoin represents a brand new and risky concept, the value of which is not backed by any formal entity. As a young and unestablished currency, it is only worth something because people are willing to trade it for goods and services. A quick glance at the Mt. Gox exchange reveals that the Bitcoin's worth still fluctuates often, and wildly; it lacks wide acceptance and is still vulnerable to a small-disturbances. Hacked accounts can still trigger major sell-offs, and fluctuations can transform into positive feedback loops that destabilize the entire network. Anyone who puts money into Bitcoin runs the severe risk of losing all of it. As Bitcoin becomes better known and more widely accepted, it should stabilize, but right now, and for some time to come, it will remain unpredictable. Any investment in Bitcoin represents a highly insecure strategy.
It is people who take risks, and trade things with intrinsic value for Bitcoins, who give it value. For Bitcoin to become an accepted currency, users will have to go out on limbs, and be prepared to take smalls losses. However, Bitcoin is far from stable and probably will not be anytime in the near future, and no one should invest in it funds they cannot afford to lose. Ultimately, Bitcoin is a currency, and is intended for trade, not investment.

I rant on this upon occasion. I want to grab his jaw and rip it off every time I see that thumbnail.

So if a billionaire chose to invest say 50 million on the hardware to make bitcoin, would s/he be able to effectively corner the market, if that's the correct term, on Bitcoin?

Some people want to have a conversation.

I see. I guess I am lumping all cryptocurrencies together. I suppose I should find out the difference among them. Got any links for me?
Why would I down votes for asking a simple question?

I's always funny that some will take the time to ridicule others, when it takes the same amount of time to answer an innocent question.
