Comparing gold to btc is being brain dead
@_date: 2019-02-02 01:41:24
You can say the same about pokemon cards, or panini stickers imho
@_date: 2019-02-01 15:39:30
Thats your answer?

Dont get too confident about Fidelity or thr NYSE, they are just looking for free advertisement and exposure. They are absolutely not putting their reputation on the line. 
The future have nothing to do with bitcoin. What's really hapening is people who put money in bitcoin will be looking for every "positive" news to comfort themselves. Which is not the actual reality

Ok, serious question. No one is surprised that even when uncle Jack heavily shills bitcoin for hours on twitter, bitcoin still didnt move (even lost 1%)
He even dropped his weight and reputation behind it! For god sake, no more newbies to buy some?

As I said, pokemon cards were great invention. Didnt make anyone holding them millionnaires...
@_date: 2019-02-07 10:41:57
Exactly, you will be reported by  and  (two of the biggest bag holders in the group)
@_date: 2019-02-03 01:04:33
Do you really believe what you are saying?
It really scares me that some people think like that. I dont know how much money you burned in btc, but it seems that you were late to the party
@_date: 2019-02-01 06:29:37
Your bags seems too heavy to carry, drop some or otherwise you might blow up at this spead...
@_date: 2019-02-01 03:30:24
The best comment I have seen for a very long time in this sub. Thanks mate!
@_date: 2019-01-20 07:13:00
I would like to thank all the bag holders
@_date: 2019-01-29 03:48:23
Wait, it is not too late? All the whales have cashed out, and whats left are newbies fighting over scraps
@_date: 2019-01-26 06:41:04
Thanks for the tipping! :)
@_date: 2019-01-14 14:59:51
Give me that worthless paper hah
@_date: 2019-01-13 10:35:04
These type of comparaisons always make me laugh. Just a sign of how heavy the Op's bags are.
I am really surprised how people can get sucked into such scams and start repreating like parrots.
The number one rule in investing is cut your losses, and let your gains take care of themselves. Holding a valueless virtual piece of code, and sinking your savings in it is the worst decision you are going to regret for many years
@_date: 2019-01-22 11:51:41
You made a bad investment decision. Best advice is cut your losses and move on

He meant a house from Toys R US 
@_date: 2019-01-13 19:45:15
You worked for free then?
@_date: 2019-01-22 11:55:58
You started buying bitcoin in dec2017???
@_date: 2019-01-13 19:16:18
I call your BS. No one would do stupid stuff like that. You can easily buy btc, buy from them in btc, then convert back.
Sorry, but you are just saying BS
@_date: 2019-01-26 13:45:36
You are even a millionnaire, or a soon divorced man! Haha
Who would be happy to throw 40k out of the window!
@_date: 2019-01-27 07:31:07
@_date: 2019-01-27 07:30:58
Totally agree with you :)
@_date: 2019-01-13 10:23:48
Why on earth would you get a 20% discount by paying with btc? Looks like a scam to me. Who is paying this 20% to the amazon seller?!
@_date: 2019-01-21 11:15:02
Thanks for the tip! I will make good use of it :)
@_date: 2019-01-25 13:56:17
What happens to miners then? They will get half of what they are getting now for the same price.
Anyone have an idea? As if break even now is 4k, the new breakeven will be 8k!
That will probably have a bad effect
