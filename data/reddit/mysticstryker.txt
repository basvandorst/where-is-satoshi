You've invested hundreds of thousands on crypto?
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:10:50
Yeah. I've seen enough to know it'll eventually go back up then eventually go back down again. I'd just sell it once it hits 9.5
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:01:34
Was this story real? I never got the confirmation. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 17:37:06
That make sense. Low risk, but still can reap high rewards if Bitcoin really takes off.
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:51:31
More like a quick investment.

Hey hey heeey
@_date: 2018-05-23 21:56:53
Yes I would
@_date: 2018-05-23 21:11:19
Thank you
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:03:58
Well good for you and good luck. Go big or go home.
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:07:08
Stupid question, but how do you buy Bitcoins? I'm planning to buy if it dips below 7k.
@_date: 2018-05-12 17:36:21
Good luck.

Thanks, I'm sure most people have the same mindset because of how predictable this all has become these last 5 months. It's like deja Vu in this subreddit sometimes.
@_date: 2018-05-23 21:13:29
I agree. The truth is that we all don't know. Bitcoin has as good of a chance to reach 20 to 30 thousand as it does reaching 300 dollars. We're all risking something by investing.

Off topic but where are there so many cars parked under that building in that picture? They had enough time to get the post up. Why are those cars there?

If you can't trust banks, who can you trust?
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:53:20
30,000 based off what evidence?
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:53:58
Based off of the thumbnail, I thought that was majin boo
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:36:22
Based off of what?
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:01:35
It was a really good series. I used to go on marathons where I'd watch all 3 movies consecutively.
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:22:03
The car sounds had me rolling ��
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:21:22
How did the car move and the lights turn on?

Hindsight is 20/20. The same could've been said about Amazon and Netflix 10 years ago.
