Unfortunately I panicked when I saw it was a scam and just got out of there ASAP.
I have checked my google history since and found it under bitpay with a url addresse but didn’t want to open it invade of a hack .
My advice is only buy from Ledgerwallet.com which this site wasn’t

My views exactly regulations are being put in place and the G20 will clarify that so soon I expect big retail investment to come and hopefully up up and away

Does there have to be a point it’s a forum isn’t it but hopefully it will hopefully give encouragement to others showing my confidence

Trying to fully understand this sell off because the charts showing the large transactions with time dates and price where shown on Reddit with wallet addresses as well but now we are told a over the counter buyer or buyers were involved through an exchange but did not manipulate the price of btc ??? How can this be the case. I understand buying and selling through local bitcoins shouldn’t affect the price of btc.

So some someone on here has got some common sense unlike some chinky arse hole that just posted

Totally agree the crypto world needs regulation to survive, otherwise it will function like the black market, for the crypto ecosystem to become main stream we need acceptance which can only happen with world acceptance

After regulation and NYSE investment $50.000 should easily be achieved 
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:28:08
I expect the G20 to clarify regulations giving big retail investors the confidence in the crypto ecosystem governments know it’s the future technology so hopefully a good outcome for btc

Crypto is the future so just hold your btc and do not sell until it becomes mainstream at that point the price will moon . There are traders and holders, at the moment trading is just chasing your own tail some you loose and some you win.
That’s exactly what I am doing my plan is long term . Good luck for the future
