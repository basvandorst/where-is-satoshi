I just laugh at people when they tell me "Cryptocurrency isn't actually worth anything dude! It's just nothing! You're stupid for buying it because it has no value!"

You don't either because there isnt any. They want the social graph that's all.

Yes its clearly obvious that I completely lack an imagination. Good observation. Snapchat is the next Apple.

Supposedly Facebook offered Snapchat 3bn. The google rumor seems to be even more rumor than that. Either way, they're both stupid.

Well the income that was used to purchase the Bitcoin was already taxed. The transaction on the purchase was taxed. Then the conversion back to USD will be taxed. Assuming the guy would like to spend his new earnings, his original investment will have been taxed a minimum of four times. Once he dies, his children can then pay taxes on his already taxed assets!

I pay people smarter than me to worry about my taxes. I have no problem paying taxes. It's just fun to complain. 
That said, lots of people will get fucked in the coming years.

You're taking this entirely too seriously. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:30:45
Easily. Any major exchange will be able to fill that order. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:05:11
They tax the conversion from Bitcoin to USD, not just the gains.

This never happened. If it did happen, he sold long ago.

They'd never hit an exchange obviously. Sums of coins this large are moved off market at a reduced value. An institution would be very interested in purchasing the coins at below market cost, so it's entirely possible he could be a billionaire.

And here I am looking at my .1 BTC.

Surely you realize the past few months havent been the norm for bitcoin... $100-200 was the norm for most of the year. So if you're expecting Bitcoin to return to normal, then yes, bitcoin will return to around $100-200. The only thing keeping it above those levels was a concentrated effort by MtGox and friends on the news of China going ape shit for Bitcoin. Turns out, China doesn't care. So, as soon as MtGox lets go of their artificial price manipulation, $100 will become the norm again.

No offense, but that is monumentally stupid. I buy in small amounts with each drop, just in case that's as low as it'll go. I spend progressively more the more it drops, within a reasonable amount that I am comfortable losing. Started at .1, then .2, now .3, and so on. I just keep incrementally increasing the amount of BTC to match the amount I'm willing to lose. Eventually I might be able to buy entire bitcoins, but the price isn't there yet. And if it does all tank, at worst I might be out $500-1,000.
