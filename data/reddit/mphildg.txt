Both times I used the priority setting - highest fee fastest conf, but there were a few hours where the wallet said the priority fee was almost 10x what it was averaging for days before and since.
@_date: 2016-08-28 21:43:00
It was 27 inputs which came out over 4kb.
@_date: 2016-08-28 21:46:36
Yeah, I suppose I could have chosen a lower priority, because I could have afforded to wait, but I didn't want to end up making a 'my transaction won't confirm' post on here :-P

@_date: 2016-08-28 21:48:35
Yeah, I know I've probably ended up paying a few % extra for my bitcoin, but who knows what the price will do, so I thought best to average in.
@_date: 2016-08-28 21:52:11
I understand the fee market, and I think it's fair play really. The race is on to innovative and scale safely before adoption really takes off.
I didn't understand why the priority fee was briefly about 10x what it should have been though..
@_date: 2016-08-29 13:24:28
No no, I understand the fee system. I had been planning the transaction for some time, and I always use the priority setting knowing it can be significantly above average. I was expecting to pay about £2.50, but at the time I came to make the transaction, the priority setting gave a fee of £20+.
I didn't screen shot and I obviously didn't make the transaction at that point. Later when I checked, the fee was as expected again.
I couldn't find any reason for it.

Each miner probably has a very similar batch of TXs because they will likely all pick up the highest fee paying ones first. But yes, they work on their own versions of the next block, until one becomes accepted.
They can continue to mine their version of that block after an alternative is accepted if they want, but they would then be causing a fork - two valid versions of history.
One side of the fork is advanced further than the other and converged upon, and the other one is 'orphaned'.
This usually only happens by accident, when two versions of the next block are found practically simultaneously. And you probably wouldn't notice, because almost all the same transactions would probably be included in both versions.
Miners usually drop what they're doing and start building on the most recent block.
They are never technically 90% of the way to solving a block, because they are solved by trial and error - doing a hash that takes a tiny fraction of a second many, many times.

Learn the basics of how bitcoin works. Most importantly - private key storage and recovery.
Find a place to buy BTC and get a very small amount to play with.
Get hold of a hardware wallet, test it to be confident that you understand what you're doing and then set it up in a way that you are happy with.
Start putting any money that you would otherwise save in a bank account into bitcoin, and moving it to your storage solution.
Then, hodl.
@_date: 2018-09-25 13:14:17
Yes, I think so. 
Learning the basics should be step 1, or you will make unnecessary mistakes. 
You will most likely make some necessary mistakes too, which is why you start off experimenting with a very small amount to send to yourself.
I should probably have included getting a desktop or mobile wallet set up between those two steps, so that you can send the coin you buy somewhere that you control and check out the things you can do with it.
Then before you put any remotely serious money in, the hardware wallet. I think it is a MUST.
Hodl is a meme misspelling of 'hold' from way back, which has come to mean - having the courage of your convictions, and not giving in to fear, uncertainty and doubt by selling.
@_date: 2018-09-25 13:22:21
You run a computer that stores the whole history of the blockchain on it.
Then it receives and relays transactions and blocks to other nodes, checking that they are valid according to the consensus rules.
This is crucial for the network in general and allows you to directly verify transactions, removing the need to trust anyone else to do so for you.
You can find guides on how to do this online, but it's not a good starting point for a new user. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 12:13:56
I don't know for sure but i doubt that it is significantly better, if at all. 
Mobile wallets are not suitable for hodling your saving on. If you are not a security expert, PC wallets are not much better - potentially just as bad or worse.
That's why EVERYONE suggests hardware wallets - they are designed for this. Other hardware just isn't.

Yeah, I was watching a recent Q&amp;A video from Antonopolous and someone asked him something like "does the adoption of the lightening network make it harder to hardfork in the future?". He had to think about it for a second, and then he was like: "Yes it does!".
I think that if that's true, HF to increase block size just won't be a viable option in a few years' time. If fees get ridiculous on chain again, I think it will just catalyse more layer 2 adoption, and efforts to scale on chain through SF efficiency boosts.

Isn't it 'given' that bitcoin is under constant attack from all currently imaginable angles?
The BU attack is elaborate, and I would call it impressive if it weren't such a fucking ball-ache. 
As is being discussed here and in other threads; if it were all posturing on BU and their miners' parts, in order to stall segwit and keep tx fee revenues high in the short term, then I actually wouldn't mind too much. I would call it selfish but fair play, and not a real threat. 
What I do not accept is that hard forking (or even threatening to do so) without a truly dominant consensus can be anything other than a malicious attempt to derail the project. 
I'm beginning to think that if they do have those motivations then something drastic aught to be done to counter it. I have yet to understand how a UASF could really be done, but in a way I think it would be best for the core side to act first. 
Either BU's bluff is called, we get segwit in and dance into the sunset together, or we exorcise the arseholes who wanted nothing more than a contentious split in the first place. 
Either way though, at this point I would like to see some action sooner rather than later; I've had enough of trying to find the common ground, when to me this is nothing but a power grab. 
In the event of a split, I see OP's sentiment that attacking each others chains is not what bitcoin is about, and warning to wait until the dust settles before making any moves, but I would actually rather have seen a call to arms.
If BU really want to pull this shit, then nothing would make me happier than for all the righteous hackers out there to grab that client by the bugs and squeeze; except perhaps seeing BTU coin get immediately sold into the ground. I will be amongst those happily firing the first shots.
I know this will set bitcoin back by years, but if I can recoup most of my investment by selling BU, then I'll be happy to hodl through whatever comes. 
@_date: 2017-03-31 13:14:07

@_date: 2017-03-13 13:11:23
If Segwit is activated, but not immediately used by everyone, then the full capacity increase is not immediately realised. But if i send a Segwit transaction, does it use less data and therefore i get a lower Tx fee right away?
@_date: 2019-03-28 13:46:11
Rather than lending a fraction of deposits, the system as a whole ends up lending a multiple of deposits.
86% of an original deposit that I can borrow from Bank 1 and pay to you gets deposited by you with Bank 2, treated as a new deposit and 86% can be lent out again. Rinse and repeat.
Total lending ends up being more like 1/14%, not 1-14%.

Haha, Yes - That's a fair point; it's understood by the wrong people.
I mean the 'academics' though. In my conversations with other economics lecturers, very few of them could actually understand the merits.
They were almost exclusively suck in the thinking of: "but the money supply couldn't be expanded to keep up with economic growth" and "in practice it's too difficult to control the broad money supply anyway".
I'm just like: Goddammit! Stop reading that shit! &gt;.&lt;
@_date: 2017-03-31 11:13:25
In my opinion, one of the main problems is information-asymmetry.
Uncommon technical knowledge is required to understand how it functions; user friendliness still has a long way to go.
Also, as an economist, I fear that the implications of a sound money system are are not widely understood. Since it hasn't been seen (practically) in living memory, it's very hard to know what a bitcoin world would look like and to convince people that it would be an improvement. 
My 2 cents.
@_date: 2019-11-27 14:44:00
Electrum is great. It's very versatile.
It works all by itself on your computer, but also you can use it with a hardware wallet which is a definite security upgrade from keeping the private keys (access to your bitcoin) on the computer itself. 
It depends on how much value you are securing, but it would probably be worth looking into getting a Trezor, BitBox02 or Coldcard. They are all offering discounts for black Friday.
@_date: 2019-11-05 11:32:52
I have tried all 3 of these wallets, as well as the ColdCard.
Previously I have recommended a mixture of Trezor 1 and Ledger S to my noob friends.
Trezor 1 has been the most successful recommendation. Really, there's nothing that can go wrong from reading the instructions that arrive with the device. So long as you are always careful of imitation websites, and keep the device and seed backup in separate, physically secure locations, you have a perfectly adequate and cost-effective solution for stacking sats. My friends report feeling confident in their set-up, and I don't lose any sleep on their behalf.
The Ledger has produced many more user issues. I honestly think that it tries to offer a bit more, but doesn't get the user interface and experience quite right. I'm not saying there's anything badly wrong with it, and I haven't tried the latest ledger products, but I am not currently recommending them to friends.
I recently tried the new BitBox02, BTC only version. I actually really really want to like it. I have had a technical issue with my device which is ongoing, but their support have been very responsive and helpful. A bit more on this below.
It has a lot to recommend it for noobs as well as more advanced users:
* Design is very cool - Looks nice
* Touch interface is good - Probably the most efficient method I've come across for inputting passphrases and seed words directly into a HW device (disclaimer: I haven't tried Trezor Model T yet).
* Dedicated app is good for noobs, while also offering a good amount of functionality; including connecting to own node and coin selection when spending. I actually haven't seen the latest version of the App, but if they have added the option to display fees in sat/byte then I will have no complaints left about it.
* USBC connection - I am very much looking forward to using this with the promised mobile app (not yet available). So long as the mobile app measures up to the desktop version, that would be a huge **PLUS** for me, and I'm sure many others would highly rate that feature.
* Set-up is very very simple. It prompts you to create an SD card backup. Advantage of this is that it's an extremely quick process to backup and restore. It's a great option to have, and allows quick swapping between multiple backups if you like. However, I wouldn't feel comfortable allowing a noob to rely on this backup method alone. (You can also access and record the seed words on paper). AFAIK It's not an encrypted text file like Cold Card, so you can't retrieve the seed words from it without the BitBox02 device itself. As in my case, where there were technical issues with the device not being detected by my computer, a less experienced hodler might have become quite anxious about recovering their funds.
* Similar Price point, which makes it an absolutely credible competitor.
I believe that ColdCard is actually the best option but, as others have said, it's not as noob-friendly.

I agree. We went from one off-putting extreme to another with Sats. And we should be sticking with the existing conventions for metric prefixes.
You have to ask yourself, when it's arbitrary how many decimal places were used in the original design, why 8 and not 6 or 9?
The answer that I have always thought was obvious was that 1 millionth of a bitcoin (μBTC), which I believe is the commonly referred to "bit" would be a comfortable sized unit, with 100 sub-units; Sats (cents).
I don't know if Satoshi actually wrote on this topic.

^This is a great answer.
Another thing is that if you are "gathering up little bits of satochi here and there", then it is likely that transactions you send will contain lots of small inputs. That makes the transaction size in bytes bigger which might be why the fees seem higher than they should, on top of the explanation above.
It is a good idea to take control of your own keys, and I hear good things about Breadwallet.
As mentioned above, for christ's sake, store that "horrendous pass phrase" securely. That's the difference between the two types of wallet - bitgo would look after that for you.
That's fine if you trust them, but not if you don't because it's all that anyone needs in order to access your coins. Lose that bit of paper as well as your phone, and you will never get those satoshis back.

Generally, it is said that selling BTC for PayPal is a very bad idea. PayPal is easily reversible, and BTC is not, so you run a risk of losing out.

@_date: 2017-08-15 14:07:22
Alright - my apologies then.
We have been suffering an ongoing social attack to underplay the importance of full nodes and increase the cost of running one; apparently in a bid to centralize the network and increase the miners' control over the consensus rules.
You are entirely correct in what you say.
The reason that miners are allowed to order the transactions into blocks is because they prove to the network that they have expended valuable resources in order to do so. There's no other reason for the mining process to require so much hardware and electricity.
In return the miners get the new block rewards. There's actually no other reason that they mine the chain, and if they no longer wanted those rewards then they would probably stop.
That would be bad for the security of the network, but as long as people want to buy those rewards from the miners then the coins have value and the miners can (ideally) make a profit from doing so.
The more demand there is for bitcoin, the higher the price, the more profitable mining becomes and the more people will contribute resources to mine and secure the chain. And vice-versa.

I think i would echo some of the concerns in the thread about having miners work together leading to some form of centralisation and cartel behavior.
I don't really see the use of resources of the unsuccessful miners being a waste. In the longer run the % of rewards gained is proportional to the resources contributed anyway.
If you lower both the work required and the rewards earned, then fair play - that's kind of why people mine in pools anyway, but i don't know what the other consequences of the proposal could be.
I'll have another read and a think.

You can set up a Trezor with a password, so if it is stolen, even if the thief knows the PIN they can't spend.
Likewise if someone finds your paper backup, they cannot spend without the password. 
Writing down the password is an option although it may defeat the point. That said, forget the password and you are F***ed.

Just a little red flag: You have stored your 12/24 words backups hear and there, haven't you?
Just because you have a hardware wallet doesn't mean you don't back it up.
In fact. what it does mean is that you can safely carry your coin with you wherever you go. If your ledger is lost or stolen, your coins are still secure, and you can restore from your backups.
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:43:44
Well, the same as any wallet. By searching the blockchain for balances at any o its public addresses.
If the cold walled is literally piece of paper, or a USB stick (i wouldn't use USB method myself - don't know enough to make it secure) then it's not going to check for balances, but if they are there then they're there.
Have you thought about a hardware wallet for cold storage? Much more user friendly.

Thanks for the reponse; I definitely agree.
The socialist-leaning, possibly well-intentioned policies that are pervasive now are leading to a lot of free-riding and misaligned incentives.
I first found out about bitcoin around 2011/12. I had studied Economics at Uni, and I was hugely demotivated by what I learned. And i was perhaps naively attempting to redesign the monetary system in my head. I was into some work by Michael Kumhof (Sp) at the bank of England who was talking about the new case for the Chicago Plan - basically erasing lots of private debt by issuing a non-debt-based currency as a citizen's dividend without counterparty risk.
So I was stewing on the problem of allocating the new currency, given that I was firmly in favour of meritocracy, and sure governments would still act corruptly in the issuance of such an asset, when I heard about bitcoin - I think it was on the Keiser Report - I couldn't understand code, but I was assured that this asset had the sound money properties I was looking for.
At first, I thought the first come, first served allocation mechanism was going to be terrible, until I realised that I could be among the first served. Now i'm fine with it :D
I just desperately want bitcoin to succeed now, because i think it has the potential to put the world economy back on the right footing for the long term.

Normally this fee (about 50 sat/byte) would be enough, but the latest influx of transactions have all had similar sized fee rates.
I would wait it out. Either the tx will go through or it will be dropped from mempools and remain in original wallet.
I've read that you could also send a tx with those unconfirmed inputs from the recipient wallet, with a high fee to pay for both tx's, and some miners will put both tx's through to gain both of the fees.

Well, all the Trezor does is generate a private key and give you the seed words. If you write them down in a secure environment (no cameras pointing at you, and not spoken aloud in case of any microphones) then at that point you have control over a secure bitcoin wallet.
It is no less secure if you also create a paper copy of the first public address that it generates (which is safe to screenshot and print), and then you have a paper wallet that you can load up and restore at any time. If you wipe then Trezor, you can then repeat the process to create as many paper wallets as you like.
The down-side is that if you want to spend from your savings on the paper wallet, you have to restore it first. Could be on the myTrezor site, or a mobile or desktop wallet (they all accept the 24 word seed format). Once you've typed in the seed words though, the wallet is potentially compromised. The seed could have been key-logged or you might have a malicious version of the wallet software or something like that. So paper wallets are not really 'reusable'.
For that reason, I use the paper wallets I've made as an emergency place to send funds temporarily if I think that another wallet could be compromised, or to physically give small amounts to the people I evangelize :p
In fact, a much more convenient and probably more secure way to store your savings is just left on the Trezor. This because you can spend from it without compromising the seed, and in the event that your paper backup of the seed was lost or destroyed, you could still empty that wallet using the Trezor to a temporary one while you generate a new secure wallet. 
As for the bitpay account. I haven't had any need for one myself, and i don't know all the services they offer. They are a well-established company in the space, and probably just as trustworthy as any other (i.e. not completely trustworthy). But if they offer services that you want to use then go for it. Just don't be too shocked if you wake up one morning and they've been hacked ;p

When you restore it asks you if there is a password, so you can get to the various HD wallets with the applicable passwords.
Once you're in, it scans for accounts within that HD wallet and you can add as many of them as you want to Mycelium.

No worries :p
That's right - the wallet doesn't need to be aware that it's being sent the bitcoin. It's recorded on the blockchain - you can always look it up.
When you come to spend those coins again, i'm not sure how you would go about it using your offline computer - not confident enough in my opsec.
My preferred method would be: Generate a wallet seed offline (actually hardware wallets are great for this) The private key never goes online, supposedly good entropy for generation of the seed and you can wipe them right after you write down the 24 word backup and a receive address.
Presto - paper cold storage. Send whatever you want to the receive address. Then when you want to spend, you import the 24 words into whatever software you want (making sure that you have another secure place to send the rest, since the original paper wallet might be compromised somewhat by restoring the seed.

AFAIK the risk of node centralisation is that it leads to miners being able to change consensus rules without any resistance from the community. Hence the importance of keeping it cheap for more people to run them.
Also important to keep in mind that, to me at least, central and decentral-isation is a spectrum. There are elements of bitcoin that are not as decentralised as we would like, but anything that starts down a slope toward centralisation is important to avoid if possible.
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:19:39

@_date: 2017-08-18 15:29:28
Well it seems to be the miners that are intent on changing the consensus rules. That's why I mention them. They clearly know that they need to centralise nodes in order to control the rules. Hence they want bigger blocks, even though its just as likely to lower fee revenue as to increase it as far as i can see.
Perhaps centralisation isn't the right word for what i'm imagining would happen under cooperative mining as you describe it. Still it makes me uncomfortable.

1. Strongly recommend a hardware wallet like Trezor - like a reusable paper wallet. It's good for long term storage, but can also securely spend from it without having to generate a new paper wallet. Bonus answer: there's no need to make an intermediate transaction - I would save myself the fees and send direct from Trezor.
2. If you wanna buy bitcoin and get it sent to your Trezor, you could just make a note/pic of the public address/QR code it shows you, but it might be considered bad practice to reuse these. Trezor has a really neat integration with Mycellium wallet on Android (and probably others, idk) where you can add a Trezor account. Funds can't be spent without pluging Trezor in, but you can access all your public addresses and past transactions - like a watch only account - and easily send btc to it without the Trezor present.
Bonus Answer: you can use the Trezor to generate as many paper wallets as you like, securely. You plug it in, go to the mytrezor site and create a new wallet; it tells you to write down the seed. Then take a pic of the public address and QR code, print it out and boom. You could seal the private key inside a little envelope with the address and QR code on the front (or whatever security precautions you might want to take to separate them, idk). Then you wipe the Trezor and repeat.
Once you have an account on the Trezor that you want to use, you shouldn't wipe it to create more paper wallets though. Supposedly the restore process to get your main account back is secure the first time, but if you have to keep restoring, the seed becomes more guessable.
3. The private key (or seed words) give direct access to your coins because unless it is also encrypted with a password (an option that Trezor supports) you can type those words into Mycellium or other wallet's restore, and boom - spendable.
If you know the Public address of your paper wallet, you can type it into any block explorer like blockchain.info and see the "balance"
Bonus Answer: When you restore a seed on Mycellium for example, it asks you if the seed is going to be encrypted and then allows you to enter a password.
4. I don't personally use an online wallet any more. Not very secure, usually requires a certain amount of trust.
If you get the use of a card that makes it worth the risk for you then fair play. It's fine to send right from Trezor to that service.

It's unknown whether moving lots of transactions off-chain would dramatically lower the number of on-chain transactions paying fees to miners, or if it would spur adoption and increasing numbers of on-chain transactions would still be required.

Glad to hear it. 
I have not used bitaddress.org myself, and I could not say if it is secure or trustworthy. Personally I wouldn't use it for that reason - I don't have enough knowhow for my own peace of mind.
Other than that, the plan sounds good to me. You might consider looking on localbitcoins or bitsquare to avoid having to give up personal information when you buy, but that's up to you - they may be more expensive and/or less convenient.
My advice would still be to buy a hardware wallet. But if you aren't investing enough to justify buying one, then I believe you would be best off using a desktop wallet like electrum. 
You can obviously use password encryption, and create a paper backup to keep in the safe.
Merry Christmas ;-)

@_date: 2016-12-15 11:43:56
AFAIK Normally that is true, but with a hardware wallet the security of your private keys is the same either way - they don't leave the device.
There are differences between using the two different bits of software E.g. UI and the fee rates that they will suggest.
I used a Ledger Nano (not S) and found the ledger app less user-friendly and dependable than Trezor and the integration with Mycelium was awkward because you can't verify via the device - no screen or buttons.
I'm hoping Santa will bring me a Nano S and I will have a play around with the app which I'm sure has been updated. Hoping it will be as seamless as Trezor to use with Mycelium, because that's my preferred way.

Thank you for the response; it's very interesting.
The most immediate logic is that which u/RustyNomad puts forward. I've heard it said often that the Eurozone doesn't work because each nation no longer has the ability to debase their currency when they get into a deflationary recession.
But then, we bitcoiners are all about the sound money, so it's frustrating that removing that tool from central banks appears to produce such poor results.
It makes a lot of sense that further artificial intervention on the fiscal side is what is compensating or this effect in the USA monetary union (which I completely failed to recognize as such!).
But then, municipal and state bankruptcy is still a thing isn't it? So it isn't being (and probably cannot be) managed perfectly. 
Does this then lead to the conclusion that some sort of flexible exchange rate system is still desirable under any monetary policy scenario? And that a single world currency is fundamentally in-optimal?

Copied and edited from another comment of mine:
The thing with wallets is that they are all just different methods of storing your private key. That is the only thing that is required to spend your bitcoins (unless it too is encrypted, and then you also need the password).
With 3rd parties like Coinbase, you trust them to manage the security for you, and not get hacked. That doesn't always end well.
A wallet app on your phone allows you to hold the private key yourself. The drawback is that it is then only as secure as your phone. It might be hacked and if an attacker gains access to the private key, your coins are gone.
A paper wallet is your private key stored in various possible forms (12/18/24 word seed or QRcode or whatever) on paper.
If it is securely generated it can't be hacked, unlike your phone. If the only copy you have is lost, destroyed or stolen, then it too is gone.
A hardware wallet like Trezor is a really good option, although it's not cheap. It's a device specifically designed to securely generate and hold your private key.
It also has various other cool features for security like a pin code that cannot be attempted over and over to brute force it, and password encryption of your wallet backup.
You can also use it to securely generate any number of paper wallets, should you wish: You can just write down the 24 word private key seeds that it pumps out, record the corresponding public addresses and there you go - paper wallet.
When you use any wallet that you control the private key to, you should always record it on paper too and store it in a safe physical location. Then if your phone/laptop/trezor is lost you have a way to recover the funds.
Keep learning about bitcoin. It never ends, but it is worth it.

1) satisfying one's conception of what is perfect; most suitable.
2) existing only in the imagination; desirable or perfect but not likely to become a reality.
Well, if you want a currency that is perfectly stable in value, you would need 100% participation and a supply adjusted perfectly to match the value of stuff in the world.
I would say that's not possible in the foreseeable future.
But most suitable: In my philosophy, that's bitcoin (fully scaled version ofc.)

Yeah, hopefully this will fix the problem. The coins should be there.
That transaction has two addresses because you only spent part of the balance that you had, which was in a single input. When you do this, it sends the part that you want to spend to the receive address, and it also sends the remainder to a new 'change' address of yours.
The point is to avoid reusing addresses for multiple transactions which can help to protect your privacy.

Well, if you sent the bitcoin to that wallet yourself from somewhere else, like an exchange, then you should be able to login to the exchange and find out the address that they were sent to.
If you know that, you can search it on E.G.  
If the coins have been sent somewhere else, and it wasn't you. You've been hacked.
If they are still there, you should be fine. You could keep trying to login, or else 'recover' the wallet using the seed words that you should have written down, with a different wallet like Electrum.

It's just a very simple bit of hardware that  isn't capable of doing anything else like running malware. Minimal attack surface. But the same is true of a paper wallet - but like I say Trezor gives conveniance too.
I'm sure I've read somewhere, from the company that make them, that you could plug it in and sign a transaction on an ancient machine in a public library, full of viruses, and it would work as intended and be unaffected. 
In reality, unless you are going to take one apart and examine all the components and code (+understand what you're looking at, which I cannot), then there's no way to 100% guarantee that it's secure.
But Trezor has become 'the standard'. Satoshi Labs were (at least one of) the first companies making hardware wallets, and a lot of respected bitcoiners swear by them.
 - Other hardware wallets are available! ;D
@_date: 2016-12-02 11:17:38
I think that once you recover the paper wallet to spend from it, you should consider it compromised.

I'm not a dev, but..
I believe that if segwit becomes comprehensively adopted it will effectively add 70% to on-chain capacity. So, if you take the common estimate of 7 TPS at present, then we'll be at 11.9 TPS.
But when it comes to Lightening, as I understand it, there is theoretically no limit to the potential throughput. We know that an on-chain transaction is required to open and close channels, but it's not clear how people will use channels. E.g. How many channels each user might need to open and often they might be closed because they are contested or useless, or whether they will tend to be left open perhaps indefinitely.
I have also read that lightening can give vast improvement to fungibility too with routing via Tor; effectively becoming a massive tumbler.
There are also lots of other fungibility improvements in the pipeline. It was a big talking point at the Milan scaling bitcoin conference. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 12:09:02
I gather that SegWit will be helping this use case by rearranging the incentives: making it relatively more expensive to expand the UTXO set (big input -&gt; more, smaller oututs) and relatively less expensive to perform a transaction as you describe, which reduces it.
There was an Andreas Antonopolous video explaining this I believe - can anyone find it?

Every time a block is found, your previous transactions gain another confirmation because the blocks are built on top of each other using the information from the previous block as part of the proof of work, so older ones will have more confirmations.
I might get corrected on this, but AFAIK bitcoin days destroyed is kind of a measure of the size of inputs and how long since those inputs have last been spent. 
So, spending 1BTC which you received yesterday should mean 1 day destroyed.
Spending 0.5BTC received yesterday should mean 0.5 bitcoin days destroyed. 
Spending 1 BTC that you received a year ago should mean about 365 bitcoin days destroyed.
Its an interesting thing to see the bitcoin days destroyed in each block, as a very high number indicates that coins which have been held for a long time are on the move.
The long confirmation times is because mempools currently have a lot of transactions in them. See the threads on here discussing whether this is possibly another spam attack on the network.
If you paid a decent fee the tx will still go through in time. Sending another new transaction from the same wallet will not push the earlier transaction through any quicker.
There are ways to boost your fee and push a tx through, but I don't know too much about them and I suggest just sitting tight.
@_date: 2016-12-19 15:54:39

If you have the from address, you should be able to follow the coins.

I did see a talk about sub-satoshi paymetns: Apparently you could do them in a probabilistic way, where the sender offers two or more transactions to sign depending on the fraction of a satoshi that the payment is for, only one (or some) of which will be valid, and the receiver chooses which one they want signed and a % of the time they receive the satoshi and the rest they don't :p

Trezor will let you securely generate a seed, from which you can derive as many private keys as you need, all of which are stored on the Trezor and nowhere else.
Trezor will prompt you to create a paper backup of your seed key in 24 word form.
It will show you public addresses corresponding to your secret private keys which is where you send the bitcoin you buy. It'll give you a new one for each transaction for privacy purposes, although you can reuse addresses.
If you're storing large sums, its wise to spread them over multiple different storage methods.
If you lose the device, you use the 24 word backup to restore it on any wallet software.

I think the biggest issue with a split would be that the average potential new user will not know what happened, what a fork is and which bitcoin is what. they will just switch off.
That will prevent bitcoin growing in adoption.
I have no problem with people forking bitcoin, I just pray that they call it something else.
@_date: 2016-12-16 17:29:42
To me, in terms of monetary policy, predictable is the ideal. I think that's the best we can do.
We have this volatile period where adoption begins and progresses, and if it continues and matures it will become more stable. That's when the hard-coded policy will prove its real utility.
In the 'end game' of 2140, with zero inflation, I also theorise that this would be a good state of affairs; a growing economy will experience falling prices and vice versa.

In fact, in some instances it's in the miner's interest not to fully verify, because then they can spend that bit longer trying to find the next block by assuming that the info they get is correct and already validated.
I believe this is a strong reason for not increasing block size, because validation would take longer.

I seem to remember a similar thing being said about Segwit2X! It's a non-starter! It should not be launched as a hard fork of LTC or BTC. That's really stupid.
People have mentioned that it could be made a side-chain to BTC, which in theory sounds really neat.
All it actually needs though is a non-scammy implementation with a similar issuance schedule to BTC, as open development as possible and then to be set loose in the free market to compete.

I buy that in reference to fiat currency. I.e. Altering monetary policy under the pretense that central authorities know what the economy needs, will invariably diminish it's utility.
But I think in the case of bitcoin, the policy is hard-coded and we have yet to see if the world agrees or disagrees that it is an ideal money.
I think by your standards, there is no such thing as ideal money.
I don't know if you're hinting at gold or not, but clearly the monetary policy, I.e. supply of gold, is not 100% stable or predictable either.

So, this would just be some extra data in the block relating basically to a different chain for MW?
I think there are dangers for the users of soft fork features that are not widely supported. Presumably not all miners would be creating blocks with this extension, so if you were trying to move MW coins you may note reliably be able to.

It's annoying because if i'm restoring using seed words, then it does allow me to choose a path, but not when using xprv.
@_date: 2019-10-21 12:48:04
Hi Again! 
So, I managed to get the zprv and I believe it is correct because it produces the particular 1bc address that i'm looking for, when entered in the iancoleman bip39 tool.
However, when I enter it in electrum, it doesn't show the same addresses. Seems still on the wrong derivation path.
Any ideas? :/

Thanks for the great response!
In this case, I do not have the seed words. Only the xprv.
When I input it into the BIP32 Root Key' field, it produces the correct addresses, but doesn't seem to produce a zprv as you describe above.
@_date: 2016-12-20 13:07:17
The normal advice would be to restore the wallet using the mnemonic backup.
Unfortunately, I do not know if there is a way to do this through blockchain.info any more, and I have found myself that the mnemonics for old blockchain.info wallets seem to be pre-BIP39(i think) meaning that they include words that other wallet software will not allow you to input.
I eventually had to log in the regular way after some effort to find the password to my 2FA email account.
If you can't find the password, I don't know if you will have any luck.

There are big premiums for selling BTC in person for cash on LocalBitcoins because it's a way to avoid KYC and stay relatively anonymous .
The premiums are likely to get bigger since Coinbase will most likely be reporting directly to the IRS now, and circle has just backed out of the instant buy/sell game.
If you are willing to give over your KYC and track and pay taxes, there may still be a profit margin to be had selling to anonymous buyers in person.

I don't think you can take the fee back. You can create another transaction spending the same bitcoin, but it will only get confirmed first (and invalidate the existing transaction) if it has a higher fee.

Yes. It's the bc1 bech32 addresses that i'm trying to access, on the m/84’/0’/0′ path.

There are other reasons why your wallet might not pick up on a transaction being sent to you, but if you've refreshed the wallet and checked your receive address on an explorer like [blockstream.info]( then it's more likely that the transaction hasn't been broadcast.

Fair play. Do you think it makes any sense for asicboost miners to do this rather than just upgrade? Or only if they are unable to upgrade? 
I suppose it might become harder to get the same tx fee revenue if segwit transactions start becoming widespread, but then tx fees are still comparatively small compared to block reward.. They could still try to mine empty blocks I suppose - do you see this as an attack vector somehow? 
@_date: 2017-04-06 20:49:05
One roadblock is that, from what I've read, core devs are reluctant to endorse the UASF proposal, in order to not be seen as power grabbing, like BU paint them. That's a fair point, but a lot of people would feel more confident if it did have approval of the experienced devs. 
I do think however that there are a group that will initiate the UASF out of principal, and that's all it takes.  Number of nodes is not necessarily important once the two chains exist, it's then down to the miners. No real coordination required. Of course the more important nodes that enforce it, the better. 
@_date: 2017-04-27 13:55:14
Edit: Check the fees on your transactions Vs this data.
@_date: 2017-04-11 13:22:58
I've read the HF Segwit might not necessarily have broken ASICBOOST - that's why it was proposed by the BU side.
Edit - The optimal outcome is of course Segwit with no HF.
@_date: 2017-04-03 12:19:41
What Satoshi would or wouldn't suggest is moot; unimportant.
It's also been said that Segwit actually IS the compromise on block size that the post you've quoted is talking about, just done in a smart way.
It took a lot of persuasion to get core developers to agree to increase the block size in this way, on top of the scalABILITY improvements and malleability fix, but either this has not been understood, or it wasn't what the miners really wanted anyway.
If there was no such block size increase involved in Segwit, it is thought that the upgrade would have been much less controversial.
Do the miners really want bigger blocks? or do they just want control over the block size? Supporting BU seems to indicate that it's the latter. 
We should not allow this control to be usurped. With it miners could allow adoption to increase in the short term, at the expense of decentralisation, and then turn around and hike the fee's to maximise their own revenue.
There's no need to undermine the protocol this way. If they really want to fork, then nothing stops them. But they will most likely end up losing money, like the rest of the users in that scenario.
@_date: 2017-04-03 13:26:01
I see - my bad. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-04-06 20:36:43
This. 
Just from reading reddit posts, not technical knowledge of my own, it seems that BU's death warrant was just handed down. 
The remaining miners who now know that they've been mugged off by Bitmain will be unlikely to support BU, and more likely to support segwit now. 
*If segwit is a activated, the asicboost advantage should be eliminated, which would be everyone else's interest. 
*If (although it seems to be a matter of when) a UASF is attempted to trigger segwit activation, it should be 'them' Vs. Everyone else; other miners shouldn't want to join their chain and mine at a known disadvantage. 
*They shouldnt be able to attack a segwit chain in the way that was feared, as they may not be able to mine and orphan on a segwit chain at all. 
*The price just responded positively and strongly to BU being undermined.. Again. Contrast that to the other week when the common concern was that a hard fork which might have considerable support was imminent and the floor dropped out. I think that shows what the 'economic majority'  thinks, more clearly than node count. 
I can see UASF having some proper review and support by the time August rolls around, and I feel much more confident of a successful outcome for segwit now.

No, it will be cheaper immediately.
Dust sweeping uses a large amount of 'witness' data, and by using a Segwit tx you just won't include it in the block  = smaller tx. There will then be more space in the block for others too.
Edit: Also, if the value of BTC rises and the state of the network is unchanged, then the tx fees effectively get bigger because they are denominated in BTC.

If no bitcoin were available for sale (hypothetically because 100% of people decided to HODL for a period of time), do you think the price would go down? No.
If all bitcoin continually circulates and no one eventually decides to save it (HODL), rather then spend or sell it, then it eventually ends up on an exchange being sold for fiat the price falls.
Gaining new Holders is also a form of  adoption.
@_date: 2017-04-11 13:01:31
So if the threat of BU hard fork is credible, it could be said that a segwit UASF would be defensive, and somewhat mitigate some of that potential attack?
@_date: 2017-04-10 16:00:36
BU Inc. could provide the whole buy side and even bid it up to make it appear that there is demand.
If they happen to also be the sellers, they could bid it quite high.
If it's high enough to attract other miners, even temporarily, it could tip the balance in an uncertain market after a fork.
Just a theory - not really thought through.
@_date: 2017-04-03 12:53:03
I think that's what UASF is about, although i'm not 100% convinced it's a great idea - a bit aggressive, bound to be interpreted as an attack by BU - at least until the full window for Segwit activation has played out, and then they can't say we didn't give them a chance or a warning.

The natural interest rate is zero.. So savers should accept counter-party risk for no reward? and capital should be assigned based on what?
I don't think you can call bond holders userers, since many are now getting negative rates. Surely the userers are the private lenders charging 1000's% to the average Joe. 
I like pro-family choices, but i don't think that offsetting the huge potential debt deflation with huge fiscally induced inflation is very sensible.

Fair point about people being off-put by economics and ignorant of their enslavement.
Hopefully the profit motive and entrepreneurship will lead to adoption of the style that you describe. And then some smart people will take all the proprietary technology opensource and decentralise it somehow.
I think their is also the very real possibility of dramatic and accelerated change coming out of necessity in a crisis scenario.

Am i right in thinking that solving an empty block (if i choose to include no transactions) is computationally just as hard as a full one? But a smaller block will propagate faster?

If you just typed out the numbers as they appeared on the trezor, i think you set a 9 digit pin without recording it..

@_date: 2016-09-26 08:59:32
As i understand it, the Nano doesn't generate the key itself. So just once, at the initialisation stage, you have to generate the master seed on your computer.
I gather is different to Trezor as the device generates a seed internally(??). Ledger have good clear instructions on their site on how to air-gap your computer and supposedly do this securely. I'm not savvy enough to know if it is really very secure.
I used a Nano for a while and had no issues with it, but eventually i changed to Trezor for a bit more peace of mind, and to be able to use with Mycellium without carrying the security card around with me.

A lot of recent evidence like this seems to be suggesting that, in terms of the average Joe being 'aware' of bitcoin, we've made absolutely huge progress since the last down-cycle in price.
The quantity of 'dumb money' that will be ready to rush in during the next up-cycle in price (when the average Joe loves to buy) should be MASSIVE.
@_date: 2016-09-14 12:23:28
Great to see this thread. I have a BA in Economics and taught A level as an unqualified teacher for a few years.
In the process of teaching Keynesian theory i came across bitcoin and Austrian economics while looking for answers to my own questions.
I've submitted research proposals periodically to do further work on a similar front to what you describe, and been turned down flat on every occasion; every year I think that perhaps the viability of crypto has reached a sufficient point to merit the research, since central banks are releasing papers left and right, but I've had no luck.
I think there're interesting thought experiments to be done on the possibilities within a bitcoin-centric economy, like real-time modeling, but they are probably so wildly theoretical at this stage of adoption that no university would be interested.
I thought it would be good to look into the dynamics of economics with parallel currencies though; where the $, for example, still functions as the reserve currency under traditional monetary policy, but agents are able to use crypto interchangeably, because this might well reflect a stage of adoption that we could enter relatively soon.
I though i'd look at economies which already use $s along-side their own national currency and see what the fundamental differences in policy were and how the two interact. Then substitute one or the other for bitcoin and consider possible use cases and outcomes.
I envisaged it becoming a review of rules based Vs. discretionary monetary policy, where bitcoin represents an explicitly rules-based approach.
Also recently i believe, many central banks are foreseeing a time when they will have to compete directly with bitcoin and other crypto currencies, which is leading them to design their own 'coins'.
This was posted here a day or two ago:
You can look at other alt coins that are essentially the same thing - each proposing their own programmed monetary policy. And thus far, happily, those with 'irresponsible' policies have mostly failed to gain any adoption comparable to bitcoin; which i agree is very much a gold standard, sound money ideal.

I also think that other coins are likely to be less successful at fending off conses loosening changes, since their creators tend to be well known.
That said, none of them threaten the status quo in the same way and therefore aren't really targets for that kind of attack.
I also know that not all alts are based on the same issuance schedule as bitcoin and some are openly unlimited in supply. I would never park my savings in one of those.

Each dramatic price rise theoretically leads large holders to cash in or spend a portion of their stack. It happens incrementally.
But even at $20k, a lot of hodlers still see gains to be made in the medium to long term; so may continue to hodl.
When we arrive in the long term, have some stability at a very high price and have mass adoption, the perceived opportunity cost of spending rather than continuing to hodl for the next big bull run should be much lower; so coins will begin to become more distributed at a faster rate.
It's likely that the short price history we have at this point is not enough to clearly identify this trend.

In my case, i don't really use a laptop or desktop outside of work any more.

The thing that will ensure the long term value and dominance of bitcoin is the continued rigid enforcement of the consensus rules.
As an Economist, for me the most important part of this is the inflation schedule - the periodic halving of new bitcoin being issued to miners, and ultimately the 21 million limit.
Ensuring scarcity is absolutely critical - If these parameters are ever compromised, it will lose its long term value (to me at least). 
Other coins can make similar promises but can never overcome bitcoins head start and track record in this respect. And thus far bitcoin has been resilient to consensus rule changes in a way that other coins have not yet needed to demonstrate. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:28:30
Fees replacing the block reward as incentive for miners to secure the network is part of the long run design, and necessary.
Future layer 2 scaling developments will hopefully keep transaction fees in check for the average user.
If not, then bitcoin is still good for long term savings as long as it remains finite and secure.
You might happily pay a high fee to use bitcoins you bought for a few hundred to buy stuff on Amazon when the price has risen so dramatically.

Same. I've actually changed some of my inputs back to legacy when I realized that Mycelium wasn't picking up Segwit addresses, because I like being able to view and spend from Ledger on my phone.
+Mycelium has stopped picking up price data from Bitcoin Average. I spoke to BA support and apparently they're not paying their bills and are completely unresponsive.
If some wallet would just copy all the Mycelium features and then support Segwit, they'd have all the users.

@_date: 2016-10-18 14:32:30
Well, no one knows what form a government/central bank crypto currency might take.
If it were similar to bitcoin - just, without the proof of work and the hard 21mil limit - then it would allow more frictionless exchange and be more open to competition from bitcoin.
I suspect it would lose that competition, similar to the way that current fiat is starting to lose.
@_date: 2016-10-26 13:36:45
To answer your other question about restoring your bitcoin from a paper wallet:
Paper wallets are traditionally thought of as very good, safe storage methods (again as long as they are securely generated. I only trust my Trezor for this purpose because there are websites and code you can execute offline, but I'm not confident that I understand it all well enough to do it safely), but the problem arises when you want to spend some of the funds from a paper wallet.
Pretty much all software and hardware wallets allow you to do this simply by entering your 12/18/24 word seed phrase (some prefer one or another - I think they are mostly settling on 24 because it is more secure).
Once you restore the wallet you can spend what you like, but you're then in a 'hot wallet' situation having exposed your private key to an online device. At that point if you wanted to put the remainder back into paper 'cold storage' you would need to generate a new one as the old one is potentially compromised.
That is where a hardware wallet is superior - it's like a reusable paper wallet because it supposedly never exposes the private key to an any other device. 
Trezor is the best known, but there are other options; some of them cheaper. See Keepkey and Ledger Nano S. There are also others with some innovative ideas but as far as I know they are less reputable.
@_date: 2016-10-11 13:29:15
Do you know where you copied the address from?
If you don't control the private key, or at least know who does so you can ask politely, you won't be able to get it back.
If it was a typo, then probably no one owns the address you sent it to, but you stand no chance of finding the corresponding private key, so it is still lost.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:59:05
Yes. 
Historically Bitcoin has never decreased in value over any given 5 year period.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:05:36
Firstly, there's an obvious (and stupid) way to increase network capacity which also weakens the decentralization of the network, which is increasing the block size again and again. And then there's the smart way which involves efficiency gains and 2nd layer solutions.
Secondly, 2x is a hardfork which involves loosening the consensus rules of the protocol. It would be a terrible precedent to set if a group of companies can change the rules in this way against the wishes of the dev community and average users. Especially since it potentially makes it technically easier for them to do again in the future.
@_date: 2016-10-31 17:04:10
Yeah, difficult. I suppose you tell the buyer it ships (or w/e) once it gets x confirmations and it's up to them how fast they want it. No confs, no goods.
@_date: 2016-10-07 13:11:56
One of the main reasons why prices can vary across countries is the level of capital controls they have:
If I can buy BTC in the UK and then sell it in Nigeria for say, 60% more, then that's great. I can even keep doing it and pocketing the difference each time.
It's called arbitrage, and eventually people doing it will cause the prices to equalise because they've supplied more bitcoin to the place where it was expensive, making it cheaper and vice versa.
But maybe they don't have much use for Nigerian Naira and want to take their profits in UK £s - If there are restrictions (which i believe there are in Nigeria right now) meaning they cannot easily exchange it, then they can't complete the loop and take the free money.
So the premium just sits there.
@_date: 2016-10-07 10:29:50
It is certainly falling to historically low levels Vs other currencies - see the link below. 
The UK relies heavily on having a strong currency for cheap imports. Sooner or later this significant fall in the value of the £ will show up in the price of imported goods. 
Holding bitcoin means less exposure to the £. 
Edit: Circle is the best UK option I've found for gradual accumulation.

The thing with wallets is that they are all just different methods of storing your private key. 
With Coinbase, you trust them to hold the private key, which is fine if it's only a very small amount and/or you really trust that they will always allow you to move your funds and won't get hacked. 
The wallet app on your phone allows you to hold the private key yourself. The drawback is that it is then only as secure as your phone. It might be hacked and if an attacker gains access to the private key, your coins are irrevocably gone.
A paper wallet is your private key stored in various possible forms (12/18/24 word seed or QRcode or whatever) on paper. If it is securely generated it can't be hacked, like your phone. If the only copy you have is lost, destroyed or stolen, then it too is gone.
A hardware wallet like Trezor is a device specifically designed to securely generate and hold your private key. It will always do this, so although new models may come out with more functionality, it's not really going to become obsolete.
It also has various other cool features for security like pins and other encryption options, and can be used to securely generate any number of paper wallets, should you wish: You can just write down the 24 word private key seeds that it pumps out, record the corresponding public addresses and there you go - paper wallet.
When you use any wallet that you control the private key to, you should always record it on paper too and store it in a safe physical location. Then if your phone/laptop/trezor is lost you can still recover the funds.
Keep learning about bitcoin. It never ends, but it is worth it.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:26:50
Does it start with a 1? 
Sounds like a public address. Same thing i'm afraid; you can look it up, but you can't spend it without the private key.

I think subdividing satoshis would be possible but require a change to the code (?)
but there are plenty of other alts whose smallest denomination is worth way less in fiat terms, so i'm not sure what you're getting at. The ability to divide into smaller units will not give any kind of competitive edge until price is muuuch higher.
Being the backbone of many "blockchain apps" would be a source of demand for bitcoin, if these apps were demanded.

No one can really tell you how much to spend, but some pretty sound advice is to make your purchases gradually instead of all at once. It might end up costing you more on average, but equally it might save you from going all in at the local top.
In terms of wallets - I recommend Mycelium for Android.

If it was a lot of BTC it might be worth turning the place upside down and see if you can find a 12/24 word backup stashed anywhere.

If bitcoin hard forked, how could I safely split and sell my BUcoins without getting replay attacked?
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:22:10
You will own bitcoin on both chains.
The trick, once this happens, is broadcasting a transaction that is valid on only one of the chains to "split" the coins, so that you don't end up sending both coins by accident if you want to sell one or the other.

All you need to know is: The people who want bitcoin to be the best it can be, want Segwit.
Everyone else is either: Genuinely confused and undecided, not smart enough to recognize the superior solution or trying to undermine bitcoin for their own reasons.
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:26:55
If you keep it in any wallet that lets you hold the private keys, you will own both coins in split scenario.
Edit: Would recommend hardware wallets like Trezor or Ledger. If you don't want to spend money on one, Electrum is a solid choice for a free PC wallet.

Sounds like a transaction ID to me.
You will be able to look up the transaction on a block explorer, but you won't be able to access the coins.

I haven't done any calculations myself, but the BTC price has risen quite a bit recently, so maybe it has passed the break-even point under whatever assumptions.
Maybe others just want to mine all the coins themselves!

You can combine your small amounts simply by spending them all to yourself, with a single output. 
Coinjoin is a privacy tool for obfuscating the source of the outputs of a transaction involving may different people.

Yeah, in that comment I more or less assume that the 'bitcoin economy' can grow through increased output and/or increased velocity of money. The price level is then the output of the formula.
A few years ago I thought very hard about this because I was teaching quantity theory of money in my job, but ultimately I concluded that you can't explain everything with it.
Everything else is never 'held equal', and you can argue any position in reverse if you switch the formula around. So take it for what it is; which is a very inaccurate method of price prediction.

@_date: 2017-06-06 12:10:59
I believe it's because there was originally a year window from Nov-16 for Segwit activation.

No - not quite.
If Multibit won't let you spend an unconfirmed output, then restore your 12/24 word backup on a wallet like Mycelium.
Am I right in thinking that you didn't spend all of the bitcoin in your Multibit wallet? If you spent the whole balance, then you don't actually own any of the outputs of the first transaction any more, so then 'child pays for parent' won't work.
As long as you own the small output of 0.00005 from the first transaction, you should be fine.
Then the question is - is this the only amount left in the wallet? If it is, or if you have less than like 0.005 (guess) then you will need to top that wallet up before making the new transaction.
Either way, the new transaction will have to include the whole balance of the wallet, because i don't know of any user-friendly (or otherwise) way to select which inputs to use in a transaction - wallet software tries to select them in a smart way, so it definitely won't pick the unconfirmed one unless it has no choice - make sure you send the whole balance to give it no choice.
The second transaction should be sent to yourself, not to Shapeshift - that would pay them twice. If the second transaction uses the 'change' from the first transaction then it cannot confirm until the first transaction does. 
If the fee on the second transaction is high enough, then a miner will include both transactions in order to gain the fee for the second one.
If all goes to plan both transactions should get confirmed. You still have your remaining balance (minus the second fee) and Shapeshift get their payment.
Look at [this site]( to figure out how much you want to pay for the transaction fee. There are roughly 2000 transactions in an average-ish block, so you can figure out how much you want to pay/wait.
At the moment it looks like anything over 90 sat/byte is getting confirmed within a day or two, tops.
Keep in mind that you are also paying for that first transaction, so if it were me, i would add at least another 0.001-2 btc to the fee, as your first transaction had quite a few inputs and should have been quite expensive anyway. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:41:30
The fee is just over 10 sat/byte. There are probably around 30,000 higher paying transactions already waiting.
I would not count on this transaction being confirmed for a long time.

I'm comfortable with the amount of BTC I'm holding, so a sharp price drop would be annoying but not disastrous.
I want to hold into the possible split because the market value of each chain could be a big deciding factor and I want to be able to do my bit to tip the scales in favour of the BIP148 chain, as long is it doesn't look like a complete flop right out of the gate.
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:54:30
Bug maybe. I would recommend Mycelium if you're on Android.

Yes - Aug 1st is the date that UASF will activate. It's very hard to say what the price will do. Mostly i think the uncertainty will cause many to sell and take some profits. Some already are/have.
Bitmain says: "We will do the hard fork at 12 hours and 20 mins later than UASF. The epoch time stamp will be 1501590000." at which point, there could be up to 3 chains: The original (legacy), the UASF and the UAHF chains. 
I do believe that "the UAHF is evil", as you say. This will be a fork that is more or less exclusively controlled by Bitmain, and they are saying that they will definitely be changing the consensus rules: I don't expect this chain to hold it's value very well. 
I couldn't say whether the UASF chain will be a success, but I believe the motives behind are righteous and it would be the best outcome; it would prove that miners don't have control, and that this is a real peer to peer network.

@_date: 2017-06-09 13:32:43
I'm afraid it's impossible to say with any accuracy.
It's always possible that 20 blocks will be found in the next 10 minutes and completely clear all transactions, but it's probably not going to happen.
The transaction does appear to have a small 'change' amount which I presume you still control, so I believe you could attempt a 'child pays for parent' transaction; where you send a transaction that includes the change input from the first transaction, and attach a fee large enough to convince miners to include both transactions in their next block. 
Note that if the 0.00005 is the only input you have left in the wallet, then you will need to send more btc to that wallet first, because it's not enough for a transaction fee on it's own.
Before you do this, you should also check what the fee options are on Mutibit - I'm not familiar - Ideally you want a custom fee capability, or at least the ability to massively overpay.
If you can't do this on Multibit, it would be best to use your 12/24 word backup to import keys to another wallet first, which does allow it. You might even find that the new software would still show the balance you had, and maybe you could just double-spend it with a higher fee, but I don't know.
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:41:59
My understanding is that when 148 nodes start rejecting non segwit-signaling blocks. It's quite possible that legacy chain miners could still choose to mine on top of blocks that do not signal. And if they do so, they would soon have created a different record of events and effectively a chain split.
As long as the 148 chain doesn't gain more work than the legacy chain, this can persist. 
The legacy chain will however always be at risk of losing the majority hash power and therefore being 're-orged' and invalidated. 
That's the main reason why a party that stands to gain from preventing the activation of segwit would want to hard fork - because then the re-org cannot happen and segwit cannot be forced upon the chain they are mining; fucking up their asicboost. 
Incidentally whilst hard forking they can introduce any protocol changes they like, including any element of the consensus rules - not just the block size; which Bitmain seem to have magically conjured the 'perfect'  schedule for /s. 
Short answer: a soft fork can prompt a chain split. A hard fork guarantees one. If both instances occur, then we have 3 chains.

It's deflationary under the assumption that the value of the bitcoin economy increases faster than the supply of bitcoin.
This can happen over any period of time really, but the supposed end-game is: 21 Million coins exist (or however many are still usable - doesn't matter) and the whole world prices everything in bitcoin.
When the economy grows, there is deflation - proportionally more units of goods for each unit of money that can be spent on them; prices fall.
Conversely a shrinking economy would experience inflation as goods become more scarce compared to the money that chases them; prices rise. 
This is pretty much the exact opposite of what we see today with fiat.
Whether falling prices are bad or not is a matter of perspective. Some people will delay some purchases in the expectation of getting it cheaper in the future. At the same time, some people realise that they now have greater purchasing power than they had previously, and so make a bigger purchase.
The main reason that we're given the general impression of deflation being bad in fiat is because it increases the value of debts as well as assets. The majority of people in the developed world are debtors, not savers, so they are going to have a bad time.
Governments are the biggest debtors in the world, which is why their whole economic policy tends to center around producing inflation, rather than allowing deflation.

Might be a smart idea to recover onto some other wallet and immediately transfer to the Trezor; the recovery process itself weakens the security of the wallet.
Without looking it up, I believe Trezor has a solution to recovery that is fine as long as you don't do it multiple times, but as long as you're not going to be sending loads of inputs, making it too expensive, I would just generate a new wallet on Trezor and transfer to it, for peace of mind.

Not familiar with Bither. Can you rescan for the transaction?
Worst case scenario, check the blockchain and make sure the tx confirmed - the coins will definitely be a your address. You can then import it into another wallet with the 12/24 word back up.

Read the BIP148 description, I'm sure Shaolin Fry explained the dates - It's something like 33% hash rate will take 6 weeks instead of 2 to complete a signalling period, which needs to be done before the 15th Nov in order to activate via the original Segwit BIP141.
If the hash rate is too low and it doesn't activate, then BIP148 has failed, and contingency plans will be formed.

a) They should be observed and not interfered with.
b) i) The Govt could offer some sort of escrow service, possibly education for users - if anyone still trusts them.
ii) Banks should be instructed clearly that they are not prohibited from providing services to ctrypto start-ups or users
iii) New department with real expertise, if you must.

Am I right in thinking that mining a lot of empty blocks on the 148 chain will maybe DoS the users (not getting tx's confirmed) but add work to the 148 chain making it more likely to compete and reorg the legacy chain?
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:07:55
The best advice is always to average in. Buy a small amount each week/month - whatever you can actually afford - don't max out your credit on a wild gamble.
You might miss out on the biggest possible gains, but you might also avoid buying at the top and making the biggest possible loss. In the long-term, as you say, price is likely to rise, but the short-term is not predictable.
I often think about when I was a student: If I had put some of the money I spent on drink and drugs each month into bitcoin (rather than just reading about it and thinking how £70 was too expensive) I'd be much better off right now :p

[Old thread that talks about it](
Have a google.
It's as simple as using the outputs from the unconfirmed Tx in a new Tx with a fee big enough to pay for both. Not all miners will look out for this, but some do. Just make sure that the fee isn't too small a second time. I would feel bad if that happened.

Jihan will eventually own a complete monopoly on mining if nothing is done. BU EC, etc. are all distractions - probably never seriously expected to succeed - so that he can keep his edge.
At the very least we need to disable asicboost before status quo can be considered acceptable. And I, for one, will take some risk to try and get Segwit through at the same time.
