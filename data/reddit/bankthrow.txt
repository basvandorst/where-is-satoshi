Selling checking accounts  = literally Hitler.

Well, we're told that current customers hold the majority of potential growth for the company via money held at other institutions (including cash, investments, mortgages, etc) so that's where the focus is.

Again, fuck off, because I am an engineering student.

Your comment is incredibly unrealistic.
The credit unions near me pay anywhere from $1-3 less hourly than working for Chase. I also get full benefits - health, dental, vision - working part time for Chase. There's no credit union I've ever heard of offering that. The locations in town are also very inconvenient given my class/work schedule.

There's an above comment claiming it's a "lawyer-fueled overreaction". In my opinion, that's exactly what it is. There were no specific regulations cited during our training on the subject, just "a desire to strengthen controls and compliance"; AKA, cover the bank's ass. 
To be honest, I'd say about 80-90% of the SAR's (that we're required by law to file) we submit come from 3rd party cash deposits (i.e., someone not the account owner). If they want to get that number down, requiring ID is a the first place they're gonna start.

Ahh. Well, the only way to prevent making night deposits of cash would be to get rid of the night drop entirely. It's not like they're gonna do that  - or post someone 24 hours/day to make sure that you have an ID and are an account signer. Night deposit away, friend.

Me too!  :)

And don't want to harass you about opening up a third credit card or savings account. Unfortunately, some banks (Not Chase specifically, but others) require tellers to hit monthly sales goals. You don't hit your sales goals? That's okay! There's the door. There's 50 more people waiting for a job.
If I can make an extra $20-30/day by badgering people about opening a checking account, I'm going to do what I can to pay the bills.

It is both consumer and business accounts. It would have to be an employee listed on the account to make a deposit after March 1st. Stupid, I know. I'd suggest just putting it in the night drop if they're not on the account, which is processed twice daily.

Hi, teller for Chase here. I strongly support Bitcoin and own some myself. We've been told that these changes have been put in place as part of new "anti-money laundering policies" and the other big banks are expected to soon follow suit. Today is the first day we're required to ask for ID's for deposits; March 1st is when you must be listed on an account to make a CASH deposit into it. 
 
I have a couple requests/suggestions:
* Please don't be an asshole to me because of this. I'm a teller. I make $10/hr and am just trying to work my way through school. I think it's stupid. I know it's gonna make a ton of people angry and be a pain in the ass for everyone and I'm gonna have to deal with it, not the people 2500 miles away who made the decision to do this. 
* This applies to CASH deposits. If you want to get around it, just buy a money order at the supermarket for $0.69 and deposit it into the account. Yes, it's a pain in the ass. But supermarket may not ask for ID. 
* Don't go to Chase to make a cash deposit.

I've heard nothing about changes on night drop. Not on the account? That's what I'd suggest.

No, known runners will be able to make deposits, as long as the bank staff knows them.
