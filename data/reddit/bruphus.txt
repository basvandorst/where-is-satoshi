If you had a BitGo account linked to your Bitfinex account, you can view your Bitfinex balances in BitGo, and you can see where it was transferred to.

Fees are too high.  If they had a ton of liquidity, maybe they could demand those fees, but they'll never attract liquidity when they're competing to be the most expensive place to trade.

Circle has a max [weekly limit of $3000](  itBit is another alternative; I don't think they have any deposit limits, but they do have [withdrawal limits](

I think you misread the rules

Do you know it's due to Operation Chokepoint? There's a small possibility that it's a business account they just don't want costly cash deposits on their books.

The Chinese exchanges implemented trading fees and stopped encouraging wash trading.

Did you see the Chinese volume on LocalBitcoins?

That happens if you send coins between Circle and Localbitcoins.  Coinbase will [also close your account]( if they think you're using localbitcoins

And (it's a little ambiguous, but it looks like) the fee is 1%/month whereas the average monthly return of the S&amp;P 500 over the last 50 years is only 0.61% (median is 0.87%).

If there's a fork, that means 75%+ of blocks are Classic blocks.  Surely the majority of the core nodes would convert to classic nodes in that scenario.

If we could push the economy into a depression you'll get deflation even in what you're calling inflationary money.  What you're advocating for is not a currency that reduces in supply, but rather an economic slowdown, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, sure.  If by "deflationary money" you mean something like bitcoin, then the counter argument would be that PoW is a waste of electricity.

I had the same issue yesterday.  I went to Settings &gt; Tools &gt; Reset Application Data and it synced in a few minutes and then worked fine.  It could have just been coincidence though.

They want to make extra sure they're not enabling an unlicensed money transmitter.  I gave a [link]( to their explanation.

I made several transactions using Mycelium's low-priority fee setting because I didn't realize there was a backlog and I didn't mind if it took a few hours to confirm.  Here is one of them as an example: d1d1a8480b1d7813e80fb448545dc3e3d24314ec5db669637f158024e949e4ae
So, if this doesn't confirm, will Mycelium eventually let me re-send it?  Unfortunately I made a few transactions after this which are apparently spending the change from this transaction because there is an "unconfirmed parent" warning.
Edit: after 85 hours I got a confirmation on the tx above.

Yes, I was able to login and request a withdrawal without issue.  Withdrawals take up to 24 hours to be manually processed, so it currently says "Pending."  I'll update if the coins don't show up in my wallet by this time tomorrow.

If you are simply selling a couple BTC, you will likely get the most money for them by selling on Circle because their rate is generally above market by about 1%.  The catch is that you'll have a $300/week limit as a new account, so if you need to convert both bitcoins into USD, it would take 3 weeks.  If you need the money sooner, I'd use itBit because they won't put low limits on you.  If you're looking to trade more actively, also look at Coinbase Exchange (not the wallet) and Bitfinex.
@_date: 2016-02-06 00:47:47
Got it. I only see info on their site about buying -- nothing about selling.

Coinbase Exchange is free for passive limit orders.

spot market look-alike 
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:56:00
the day ahead swaps are really no different than trading spot bitcoin. When you buy a swap at a price, you're agreeing to buy bitcoin at that price the following day, but there is no leverage (yet), so you have to put up the full amount of USD to pay for the bitcoin, and the seller has to put up the full amount of bitcoin that they are selling you.  LedgerX is a Swap Exchange Facility, so that's how they have to structure it.  Effectively, it allows for a market that can facilitate trading the underlyer of the options contracts, which are physically deliverable (i.e. if you're long an in-the-money call, you'll receive bitcoin on expiration, which will go into your LedgerX wallet and cam be withdrawn at any time). There is currently no leverage offered on the options either.

Are there any stories of a Ledger being compromised by a virus?
@_date: 2015-10-24 16:40:59
I wouldn't rule it out.  When they first opened there was a 10 BTC cap (i.e. no interest on deposits over 10 BTC).  So, back then I would have said, why would they put a limit on it if they want deposits to steal?  But, then they raised the limit to 20 and now it's 100 so that thought does not hold as much water.  If they are legit, then I feel for them; it's awfully hard to earn trust in bitcoin land.  "Guaranteed" reserves make people even more skeptical.
@_date: 2015-10-24 16:14:02
I think it's a marketing gimmick.  If people are storing coins there, they get name recognition and maybe a fraction of those people will start trading on their exchange.

They actually hold them. Investors wire Grayscale USD which Grayscale uses to purchase BTC to put in the fund.

This is just for calculating the NAV.  The price of the ETF will trade at a premium or discount to NAV based on supply/demand of the shares.

I got an e-mail notifying me of a withdrawal request a few hours ago while I was logged in.  It was for an amount I had withdrawn in the past.  I don't recognize the withdrawal address.  I canceled the withdrawal and notified support.  My account is currently frozen while they investigate.  The attacker did not cancel open orders or enter any new orders.
Edit: a few other things to note.  1) My password at itBit is unique and very secure.  I had Google Auth enabled. 2) the volume on itBit is unusually high today which could be a result of an attacker converting fiat balances to BTC for withdrawal. 3) Support called me by the wrong name; probably just an innocent mistake, but sort of unsettling given the nature of the issue.
