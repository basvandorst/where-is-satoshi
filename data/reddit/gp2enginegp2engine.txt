Not crypto.... They can't use it there properly
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:35:06
lmao had to sneakily flex with that Supreme

Your bank account has goverment controlled magic internet numbers. Not something that goes up and down daily
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:47:39
Yep, and not like 99.99999 of people buying it. No one is using it as a currency, its more of a commodity now. A commodity that really isn't pretty to look at, shiny like gold
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:40:41
Yeah, but they certainly aren't the 95% of its buyers

You can't really use BTC for anything, it wont go over 20k
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:56:27
Which you can't use for anything.

See all of you keep talking about cryptos in general when I criticise BTC. Of course crypto is good but BTC clearly isn't the one. Banks will never accept it, and rather make their own. Comparing bitcoin to the internet is a really dumb analogy, internet is a lot more different from it

Lmao someone's salty and scared
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:17:52
That is nuts. Are you from USA, or? I can't even fathom that in a civilized western country you can't get a life saving operation done without money. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:48:46
Well maybe they need money to buy food, or gas. No one in Zimbabwe will accept BTC for food
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:27:50
Hmm tell me what can it be used for
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:44:45
Okay, so who has used it for that in the last month? No one?
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:27:23
hahahaha okay well good for you if it goes to those highs. I just dont see it being possible, as they have no real value. Once the normal people realize that, it will stop
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:37:49
Ok, go to Zimbabwe and try to buy food with mysterious internet numbers. If you succeed at first try, I'll believe you. But I think they don't even know what Bitcoin is
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:44:09
Hmm while you have great points its not like BTC is the only crypto with blockchain. Bitcoin is really useless atm, I think no one has used it to buy f.e food in a long time
