It is neutral but boy did she not explain it well. She hardly gets it herself let alone explain it, which is very evident.

Coinbase are decent, it is just that their service obviously cant handle the fluctuation of the price at high load of purchases and they reverse purchases for people at these times (they use security reasons as an excuse). Coinbase isnt really the place to catch waves of upward prices. It is more of a buy and store or use as a hot wallet. Casual user basically like what i was and hence never faced this purchase couldn't be completed issue with them.
Also you shouldn't mind sharing data with them (which i dont) for their compliance reasons with US laws. 
However you need to fit a very rigid criteria. For example, i have been using them for the past two years but stopped yesterday. I am not a US national or resident but i do bank in the US, UK and elsewhere. Two years ago i was allowed to open the account with my US bank account and provided them with my passport proof of address etc etc. two weeks ago they asked me to upload my passport again which i did and they said my id is valid but not a US ID and hence i cannot buy or sell bitcoins anymore ��. It is a bit odd that i can open a bank account in the US  and use it fully but not a coinbase account.
Basically if you dont fit their criteria 100% your out. Fair enough it is their company and they can do as they please but their customer service makes it sound like you are a bad person for not fitting the criteria.
My bitcoins were purchased through them and only stored in their vault service. Never moved or left them so no shady business here.
Thank god 2016 brought more options to the table. I am now using circle with my UK and US bank accounts so no hassle.
I bought a trezor, transferred the coins out of the vault and to the trezor and closed my coinbase account. Their loss not mine.
Give them a try anyways and you can switch if you are not happy. There are other options out there. Just get a hardware wallet for storage.

Ive tried it.
Adding funds is free from a linked bank account
Making payments to other abra users is also free.
Receiving payments from other abra users is also free
Withdrawing funds from abra to your bank account or to another bitcoin wallet is also free
The only things you pay a fee for in abra is when using a abra teller user to withdraw or credit your account ( To most with bank accounts, you never need to use a teller but in remote places in the periphery of like the Philippines where some may not have easy access to a bank branch or a money transfer office, it makes sense to pay a fee and use a abra teller user to cash out right in their neighborhood).

I dont see the issue with kyc. Let then know who i am and what im spending on. As long as your not doing illegal stuff you still get all the benfits of bitcoin and you are still in control of your money not a bank or a third party that can cease it (your the only holder of the private key on your phone in abra).
