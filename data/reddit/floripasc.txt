You can look at  for fees and here in Reddit always you'll find someone complaining about fees with some new info. Basicaly avoid low value transactions If you can. Moving crypto around is expensive today.

Your btc app have the option to backup the wallet?
And the option to save the private key of the wallet? 
If you can get the private key, just install bitcoin core and get your coins (search how you can get bitcoin cash from yours bitcoins too)
If backup is an option, make a backup of the wallet, save the APK of the app (there's lot of apps for that) and AFTER upgrade the app. If anything goes wrong, just reinstall the app, restore the wallet and try something else.
I would search the web for your app website, contact autor before anything.

Just be aware that fees can take a lot of any transaction you do if you buy/sell low values. Make your math and read a lot.

Lost coins are not in the market.
Hodl coins are not in the market.
Only sellers coins are in the market.
If you want to buy coins, you offer $1
Sellers want $2
Or both agree at $1 or $2, or there's no trade.
Lost coins and hodl coins have nothing to do with It.

There's no stupid question. Everyone is learning something. 
QR code will represent the same bitcoin address forever. As long as you keep your private keys with you and nobody else, you can have access to funds deposited to that bitcoin address.
I should remember you that using the same address for lots of transactions can help find out who you are, If privacy is important to you.

Sure, there's 2 ways to try to win some profit in forks:
1) Exchange all altcoins to bitcoin, get them to a wallet that you control the private key and hope the new coin worth more than you loose selling those altcoins.
2) keep usd read to buy bitcoins as the fork happens,   and the market stop buying bitcoins for the fork, and start selling to return to altcoins.
If you can, do both.

You can think this way:
If you buy 0.01 BTC for U$ 40 and sell It for U$ 45 you just win 10%, the equivalent of several years of interest.
Look at the profit as %, so no matter how much you invest, you are getting more than you would get in a bank.

Sure: only spend money you can loose without any problem. All of us loose some money in crypto. You will too. Hope not much, but some you will. And will gain too, If you keep going.
Best advice: When you bye and coin Góes down, remeber that you ONLY LOOSE WHEN YOU SELL IT. If you keep thecoins, one day they will go up again, and all "lost" is gone! REMEMBER THIS.
Good luck!
