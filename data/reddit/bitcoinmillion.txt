Issue with mining is as others have already pointed out the mining monopoly in the hands of a few. They basically control the whole market. In the current state, I disagree with the "scalability"

Maybe you did not mean it like you wrote, but the Bitcoin world is very small. Less than 2% of Americans 
have ever heard of or use Bitcoins. As of now many Americans have not been educated on Bitcoins.
So they are surely indifferent toward BitLicense or they may even approve of it after hearing all the Bitcoin scam
scandals. That is why we are building the Bitcoinmillionaire game.

The government will regulate the Bitcoin industry one way or the other. We've to live with reality somehow. The Bitcoin industry cannot be treated very different than other industries

Mt. Gox did not destroy any wealth. The Bitcoins were just passed 
from one wallet into another ;)

I'll be in Amsterdam in 2 weeks. Looking forward to test the BTC ATMs. Dutch people are always crazy to try out new stuff ;) But I doubt the usage rate is really that high among normal people
