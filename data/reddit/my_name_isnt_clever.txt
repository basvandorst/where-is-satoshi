I use simple and I love it, but be warned it's really just a nice UI and awesome customer service on top of the BanCorp bank. I've heard BanCorp isn't that bad compared to the other big banks, but if you want to avoid banks entirely that won't help.

Question: I've been wanting to exchange my 120,000 DOGE into bitcoin at some point (it's like $15 worth, not a big deal) is now a good time? How should I do it?

What are you talking about? Obviously Amazon is HUGE.

But if they didn't advertize they wouldn't have had the money that they used for the super bowl.

Is playing Minecraft an insult now?

I've been using uTorrent version 1.8.5 for a while now, works fine with no bloat.
