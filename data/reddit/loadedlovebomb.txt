I was wondering why so much bashing!
@_date: 2014-10-02 12:14:23
Nice! I live in Greenville, NC and could definitely get them in a few stores.
@_date: 2014-10-08 04:06:33
Just updated, Thanks! :)
@_date: 2014-10-25 15:10:59
Ive been spending btc since they were as low $5-7! Got silly and purchased a few bits @  $9XX but my average is around    $580! It's definitely been a rollercoaster :)
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:49:08
I will not contest your decision!  Ill throw in free expedited shipping lol
@_date: 2014-12-25 05:03:22
Yeahhhh! It's snowing bitcoins in here :)  
MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!

I've been meaning to buy a G Shock watch! Thanks for reminding me :)
@_date: 2014-10-03 22:20:42
I think it helps with overall cycle from miner - user - merchant back to user/market.  If merchants were to hold too many before dumping wouldn't it cause a slight crash?
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:40:53
I will check it out right away! Thanks :)
@_date: 2014-10-03 03:36:37
Mycelium Entropy for safe paper wallets!

I wish I could adopt an orphaned block! :)

Your professor hears that bitcoin is a decentralized currency among others things. Decentralized and accepted in different places throughout the world.... to him this sounds like one world currency and possibly one world government (New World Order).... Basically he's read too much into the illuminati/freemasons/evil banking families and tied secrecy with conspiracy. No worries, time will hopefully change his point of view. 
Go Team BTC!!! :)

I would greatly enjoy my new found wealth but I feel this is only possible in The Alex Galaxy!  Twelve million seems like a stretch but we'll find out eventually
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:54:36
Meh! I don't need that much money.  Willing to sell my coins for half that right now :)
@_date: 2014-09-29 02:32:08
Shares are supposed to be 0.2btc!

Darn, I was hoping for delivery before Christmas. I wanted to print some wallets with my new toy for stocking stuffers. No worries though. Thanks for the update :)
@_date: 2014-09-29 13:45:25
Sweet, Thanks! 
@_date: 2014-11-06 03:15:23
Wow!!! Love much so  :)
@_date: 2014-12-06 13:52:47
I've read, and crunched the numbers enough to know the possibilities! I fully support twelve million and would enjoy it but I just couldn't imagine actually becoming a millionaire.
@_date: 2014-12-31 06:19:33
I wish i could sell panties for btc! Happy New Year
@_date: 2014-11-20 01:00:13
Followed link but where do I enter a paraphrase?  
I could definitely use the funds for EDCLV :)
@_date: 2014-12-11 22:11:03
i will definitely give it a shot, thanks! 
@_date: 2014-10-29 18:32:15
Super Excited!!! Thanks for the update ;) 
The delay just means it will be my Xmas gift to myself
@_date: 2014-09-29 21:51:42
I'm sure we'll see them move around again at some point! I would like to see my .17 move back into one of my other wallets.  
@_date: 2014-10-04 10:37:34
Just sell it for usd then buy btc

I have faith the btc price will rise in the future!  I made a promise to reimburse them with fiat if the price dropped and stayed below what I owed them. I also pay the fees with my account. Everyone I've turned is actually excited about the technology. All your negative comments can go to hell :)
@_date: 2014-12-06 20:33:37
How broke are those phones?

@_date: 2014-12-08 21:15:05
Ahhh! I want it but I'm running in circles
@_date: 2014-10-06 09:31:56
Whatever the motives happened to be it enabled a lot of us to buy cheaper coins sooo... thank you bear whale robin hood!?!? 
@_date: 2014-12-17 10:46:51
Thanks for the tip! 
My gf is an artist so needless to say but she will be guiding me in the right direction from here..... along with YouTube videos lol 
@_date: 2014-11-09 17:18:52
Free coins are awesome regardless the amount! :)
@_date: 2015-01-31 03:04:41
Well you can shorten that number of 150000 cause i roll like 12 times a day!  I do it to help with transaction  fees
@_date: 2015-01-17 02:27:42
What we should be wondering is.... How high do you think Karpeles would have manipulated it if Mt.Gox didn't go down?!?!?
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:32:51
More like "Karpoww" instead of "kaboom"
@_date: 2015-01-23 02:34:57
It's a comment party :)
@_date: 2015-01-31 01:52:09
Thanks for the update! 
@_date: 2015-01-22 04:10:51
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:55:59
Things that make you say, Hmmm!!!
@_date: 2015-01-04 04:47:20
Totally read it in his characters voice! :)
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:20:17
hahaha! I have no business on this sub..... I was just trying to scroll on the link page.
@_date: 2015-01-31 02:54:10
Well i already own  USD, and Btc! Just considering  buying gold for the simple fact that i doubt it will ever be allowed to fail so it must go up at some point. Problem is that i always buy more btc with any extra money that i may have lol
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:46:24
Good Point, Thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-31 02:27:36
So basically invest in USD, Gold, and Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-20 14:39:04
Pretty Sweet! I have also invested in Coinbase since they still hold my bitcoins...... For now!!!!
@_date: 2015-03-23 15:26:01
Well darn, i bought a Epson WF-2540 like four months ago!
So there is no possible way to use my Mycelium Entropy with my printer?
Edit: It's fine, ill work something out. Just gotta wait for delivery and time to tinker around for a solution. Thanks for the list though
@_date: 2015-03-18 03:58:10
Anonymously, yes.... But stealing from actual ppl as in our community of btcoiners then no! Last thing i stole was when i was like 7, and it was a pack of gum!
IF i ran an exchange and wanted to close out or end it then i would have a wayyy different plan. Let every know we're closing down and to withdraw funds. Destroy servers and kill the link after the allotted time. Keep any remaining funds. This is a way better idea than screwing over other ppl in my opinion 
@_date: 2015-03-18 03:14:39
Same Shower thought here too! The name "coin-swap" pretty much sums it up for me
@_date: 2015-03-02 20:31:58
Sweet!!! Can't wait to plug this bad boy up to my printer, and rock my t-shirt :)
@_date: 2015-03-18 02:25:28
Still jealous you got yours first lol Enjoy :)
@_date: 2015-03-18 02:14:20
Can't wait for mine, so excited! Did you get a shirt too?

Pretty Sick!
@_date: 2015-02-04 16:20:07
Yeah, I usually don't have concerns or feel the need to "ask" permission when i comes to Bitcoin! For some odd reason i just wanted to double check to make sure i wasn't missing anything, Thanks!
@_date: 2015-02-26 11:27:19
I've been interested in running a node for some time now but i just came about an extra laptop in the past 48 hours. Ill be sure to check out your website after i get up and have some coffee.... it's  6:27am here lol
@_date: 2015-03-18 03:21:53
ha! Never heard of "coin-swap" that i can remember. It should be something very simple like an escrow service to buy btc using btc. Not sure how that whole blockchain analysis thing would work with that though but at least its a sold idea 
@_date: 2015-02-26 11:06:44
Not sure if this link helps you but Intel talks about
going past 7nm! 
Imagine if Intel got into selling miners at some point!?!?
@_date: 2015-02-04 14:14:40
What the heck!?!?! I wish i could save some btc from being lost
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:19:23
Didn't know if there is any tax paperwork or KYC type stuff I should be aware of

I set up an item for sale and it was very easy. It still says waiting for approval though lol
Edit: Listing just approved :)
