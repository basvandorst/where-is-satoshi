Didn't realize they started offering bitcoin as a payment method, thanks!

I do love me some HumbleBundleage, I didn't know they made the jump to Bitcoin, thanks!

Probably wont diversify since I'm planning on cashing out at the end, though that's good to know if I become a BTC convert in the future. Though I should make some currency conversions from the 10k doge I mined when I was learning about that process. Thanks!

I gotcha. I'm trying to hit up all the "common" uses for BTC as they are available today. I'm not looking to spend it all in one place, just run the gamut of what I can do.
I see there is a list at the right for BTC merchants ( but do you have any suggestions for merchants dealing directly with BTC? I now realize that's probably important to understand.

QR might still be a good thing, but maybe just to introduce it as a concept since using QRs is a common way to send/receive bitcoin.

I know what I want to do with it (spend it and then cash out balance), but I wanted to make sure I hit up the various methods of actually making purchases.

pretty sure it implies that 8% within 12 mo + 5% within 13 to 36mo. might be wrong though.
still seems really high.
