I guess you could sell and then ask for termination.
@_date: 2014-05-01 19:56:37
Correction: You cannot sell, after this block. Fucking assholes.
@_date: 2014-04-28 19:18:18
Yes! Exactly. They just hit you with the block. You can lose a lot of money when not trading this way and they will not refund you.

Yes. Planing on moving to lower fee exchanges anyway.

How did you answer the last one, number 6. I mean i transferred my savings, that i collected over last couple of years. I dont have financial statements for them. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 16:09:25
It wasnt 'a lot' by my standard. It is a lot by Bitstamps standard. Would be hard to buy even 8 coins with the amount.

I dont even own a passport. National ID card is all i need. DO they expect me to go make one just for them, so they can have a scan of it? lol
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:49:52
I sent them a 300DPI scan of my national ID and a scan of a freshly made proof of residency. Now they still ask for a scan of passport. Thats just insane. I dont intend to go make one just for them.

Our prayers r with u!
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:42:31
That is exactly my concern. Maybe they block your account, so they wait for more money to come in. Moneybookers (now Skrill) does this. They make some bullshit excuse, like 'Your computer might be infected, so we blocked your account. Please use an anti virus.' 
@_date: 2014-05-01 07:48:20
Ask them to close your account. Their TOS procedure is selling your coins and returning all funds. Read my post below.
@_date: 2014-08-27 22:11:37
Fucking fucker!
@_date: 2014-04-28 19:16:22
Will they return my money if i dont reply? Thats the real question. I mean they are not a finacial institution, but a private company. They are not a bank or the police.

Thank you CZ!

wtf is grooveshark?

@_date: 2014-04-28 16:13:57
Exactly! My bank never asks me such questions, even if i deposit 5 times the amount i do on Bitstamp.
@_date: 2015-05-24 01:51:12
i love them! i want to have their baby!

Same here. They locked a shit load of bitcoins and i couldnt withdraw cash also. When i asked them, what exactly was the problem, all i got was a formal 'in order to fully meet our verification standards and in accordance with our AML (Anti-Money Laundering) procedures, we have determined that your documents do not meet our verification standards.'
It took me 5 days to unlock my account, only to have it locked again because of this SSL exploit.

Did anyone resolve their problems with bfx, especially those where they lost money on orderes then didnt place or couldnt close?
Currently have full margin shorts opened when 4h old orders (that where canceled) executed.
