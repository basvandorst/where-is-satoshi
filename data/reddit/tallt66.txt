I bet you are fun at parties.

Touche! That's even more amazing!

I was afraid it would not dip again. I bought $500 today. First time buyer. No guts no glory!
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:44:17
I bought today though coinbase, no apparent issues.

It's crazy how much I have learned these past few weeks. All I have really learned is how much I don't know! LOL
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:22:03
Ah! Yes I see that now!

I singed up for a Coinbase account and linked it to my bank account last week. I wanted Bitcoin a few weeks ago but things were not in place for me to buy it then :/

You sound like me all weekend. LOL I kept checking the price every few hours and I finally couldn't wait anymore.

Get a Bluetooth ear piece and an app that will tell you the price every 5 minutes.

It's kind of like washing your car to make it rain.

You would do better mining a different crypoto currency with an arrangement that earns you bitcoin as payment.

First time Bitcoin holder here. I bought $500 worth today, no regrets. HODL
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:35:02
It was hard to buy knowing that it was hundreds less a week ago, but for all we know it may never go down there again. I just put my head down and went for the buy. Now what's the term you guys use? HODL? lol
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:21:42
Yeah I want to get in out of there ASAP. It says it "arrives Saturday" is this common?

I would think anything below 7000 would count as the dip. I also bought at 6200. Bitcoin is now over $1,000 more than that. That's quite a jump.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:17:27
I didn't get it at the very bottom. I waited for the up tick and bought at 6,200. You really can't go wrong buying even now. Just get some and hodl!
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:18:11
This guy gets it!
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:41:51
I got what I could afford. I guess that's all a person can do.
