Most of the early bitcoin adopters (and cypherpunks) are also goldbugs. Characterizing goldbugs as anti-tech or as old fuddy duddies is nonsense.

No, the most exchangeable of goods which barter systems coalesce around are "chosen" organically due to multiple properties including divisibility, fungibility, ease of storage, durability, etc. Sound money is not arbitrary and is not based on "faith". Fiat currencies are arbitrary and persist only because they are demanded as tribute to gangs with guns. They are based on coercion. This requires faith in said gang. But fiat currencies are not sound money.

Should clarify, illegal in the sense that it cant legally be used as a currency because reporting every single transaction as capital gains effectively prevents use as a day to day currency. 
Bitcoin suffers the same problem, which is why in order to use it on a day to day basis for small transactions is essentially illlegal. Most people who do this are technically breaking the law because they definitely are not reporting every transaction. 
That's fine by me since enforcement is almost impossible when infractions are that widespread in a decentralized network. This is where bitcoin beats gold. It is much easier to enforce these laws with gold backed debit cards because of the necessary middlemen (storage etc.) and the counterparty risk entailed.

There could easily be gold-backed debit cards in today's world if it weren't illegal to use as a currency (capital gains). Bitcoin has advantages in terms of trust/counterparty risk but it would still be preferable to the Federal Reserve Notes we are presently forced to use.

We can't abbreviate millibitcoins to millibits and also have a smaller unit just called bits. Either have millibitcoins and bits or millibits and microbits.

Agreed. I saw a tweet from Adam Back suggesting the same: that if we do a HF we should include a bunch of other HF necessary upgrades. It seems like this could be the germ of a compromise, since both parties would like HF features at some point. 
If there could be enough consensus for a such a bundled HF, then I dont think the signers of the NYA would object too strongly to postponing the HF until next year in order to put together a safe fork that everyone can mostly agee on (I believe this was in fact tweeted in response to Adam). 
I have a lot of respect for the core devs like Luke, Peter and Greg and I also have a ton of respect for industry leaders like Erik. I think that Erik is right that the majority of miners and businesses will get their way if there is consensus between them. I beg the core devs to make a small compromise, include all your own HF upgrades and keep the family together. This could really happen. The core team needs the miners and businesses, and I believe the industry would LOVE to keep the core team in charge of development. For the love of God please dont destroy bitcoin over a 1mb increase. I am not a big blocker at all but 2mb is not the same as 8mb or unlimited. And Erik is NOT Roger or Jihan.

In 5 years, yes. A year from now it is very likely we will be sub 3k, IMO. Happy to be wrong, but this bubble will pop and I think the correction will be beneath the current price level.

Core should design a 2mb fork (with their other wishlist upgrades). I am more concerned about core not being in charge of development than I am a 1mb increase. The worst part of SW2X to me is the overthrow of core. They can pre-empt that by announcing its own 2mb fork, safe and with extra goodies, but postponed (obviously) until 2018/19. Counter compromise.
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:30:06
5k by Halloween. I think we need a correction to 3.5k and then consolidate at 4k then 4.5k before seeing 5k. Really concerned about 2x fork though, not just for price but for the community and brand dilusion and resulting confusion. Might be a perfect time for this bull market to finally end and spend the next couple years sliding down towards 1500 as a bottom, ideally. Shake out all the weak hands and seriously develop lightning networks, schnorr, MAST,  etc. Maybe once we spend a while in the 2k range and the next bull market begins by inching its way back to 3-5k we will see another exponential jump like 2013/2017. Just Speculation.
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:33:05
Agreed. No one should be blaming ancaps for anything. The cryptoanarchist/cypherpunk "movement" cites libertarian anarchism explicitly and is clearly influenced by austrian economics in particular. That is why its so stupid for Ver to claim to be the only one who understands this material. I'm an ancap and like many ancaps I strongly prefer the core dev vision over the big blocker Ver vision, considering they actually know what they're talking about.

His personality flaws aside, and his misunderstanding of bitcoin aside, he genuinely does have a better understanding of economics than the powers that be and is thoroughly anti state and anti war.

Because it will not go up and up forever. The last growth cycle corrected from 1100 to 200 and stayed around 250 (near the top of the previous growth cycle in spring 2013). Of course when btc was at 900 everyone was sure we would go up to 10k and never see 500 again. A lot of new people right now may not believe that it could ever revisit 2k but it easily could.

Now with this hopefully we can really begin to heal the wounds and accept that those in the community who pushed for B2X truly do want what is best for bitcoin, otherwise they would have went through with it. The last thing we need is to hold grudges and fuel flame wars. Maybe core can begin planning a wish list hardfork that has consensus, in addition to all the other great scaling work they have been doing and planning.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:17:21
I think it is very likely that the bottom of the coming bear market will be between 1.5k and 3k.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:39:23
I have always liked Erik, even though we disagreed about B2X he was always civil and calm, never fed the blockstream core conspiracy and I believe truly wanted the community to remain together and he appreciates the core team. People here made him out to be a villain when he never was. Roger Ver is a villain. There is a big difference between them.

@_date: 2017-04-01 22:19:22
Thanks for the response. I didn't realize that anyone thought bitcoin could scale to hundreds of millions or billions of users (that is the end goal, right?) without increasing the blocksize, even with upper layers and base layer optimizations. I agree that decentralization and security are paramount, but how could massive scale be achieved without at least doubling the blocksize? 
@_date: 2017-04-01 15:15:14
Maybe I'm confused but how is SW a compromise? I support SW 100% (disclaimer: non-technical observer and hodler) and wish we could activate but if it really is a compromise then doesn't that imply that Core has another preferred solution and that SW is not their first choice? If so what would be Core's ideal solution? Do they aknowledge that there is a problem that requires a solution? If so SW can't be viewed as a compromise. 
This post also makes it seem as though there will never be a 2/4/8MB HF which I think most people agree will be necessary at some point, even with Layer 2. Saying SW is a compromise and that HFs basically can never happen (which seems to imply Core's ideal solution is neither SW or blocksize HF?) feeds the BU arguments that Core truly would do nothing about scaling if they had their way. I don't believe that is true but can you understand how it sounds? 
I think the truth is that Core does acknowledge the NEED for scaling solutions and believes (as I and many do) that SW+LN is not a compromise away from the ideal but IS the ideal (only) path forward for achieving functional scaling.

Because most likely it is your fault. If you forget where your gold is, then you lost it. Nothing "regulation" (many people seem to assume "regulation" is this magic word that makes one immune from personal responsibility) can do about this. The only real solution is various forms of private insurance. Or stick with centralised infinite supply monopoly money.
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:07:25
Yeah, we're on the same side. But I really would not underestimate the importance of trying to avoid this incoming attack, and since people like Adam have specifically referenced a wish list HF in the past and are not opposed to 2mb I wouldn't say this was an outrageous thing to bring up. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:03:32
Lol what? Most core devs are not opposed to 2mb blocks in principle, and may be necessary eventually. Im not a 2x supporter, just trying to think of compromises to, ya know, keep bitcoin alive and with the core team "in charge", which is what I want. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 11:44:21
By the time fat fingered grandmas are using bitcoin you won't need to manually copy and paste random strings of chars to make transactions. There has already been some progress on making user friendly addresses and payment channels. But you're right, that's definitely something that will need resolved for UX.
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:28:41
Also you then are supposed to pay capital gains for that transaction. Of course almost nobody does, but technically that's the case in many jurisdictions, and if enforced, a major impediment to actually using bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-09-27 14:45:29
It would not be prompt enough for many of those who want 2x NOW, but what about at least putting forward a serious proposal for the "wish list" hard fork to be scheduled for a year from now, including all the HF-dependent upgrades and also 2x block size. Some of the 2x ppl may prefer to 1) wait a year and get what they want (from trusted core devs) plus a lot more, over 2) shattering the community/ecosystem with a contentious HF to get what they want NOW (If what they want is truly 2x block size/weight). It wouldn't satisfy all NYA signers, but might peel off enough to make it less viable, or provide another valid reason for breaking the agreement. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:30:41
Most of the people commenting must be thinking we are on a permanent exponential trajectory upwards. 25k in 5 years is realistic because btc will necessarily crash from this bubble and ride low for awhile with much less volatility before picking back up again. Granted, the bottom will likely (imo) stay above 1k. 100k in 3 years is insane, imo. Maybe in 10-15 years. 
Growth cycles in btc are lasting longer and the price is covering more ground. Since 2011 history seems to suggest a (more or less) 5-8x increase from peak to peak (30-230-1100-?). Can't assume that will continue but there do seem to be patterns in retrospect. I would bet that this bubble tops below 10k (6-8k). Just my 2 sats.
