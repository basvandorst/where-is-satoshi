That's a possibility. Another possibility is that CNN tech writers just don't know (or care) about Silk Road.

I don't understand. If they can get on the net, can't they get bitcoins?

Well, sure, you can outlaw Tor, or Bitcoin for that matter. The law can make marijuana illegal. It can make alcohol illegal. I think it's more a question of enforcement.
see 1920s prohibition
see recent censorship efforts against Tor

Hi 666kopimicv. Looks OK to me. I haven't tried Bitcoin yet, but the more I think about it, the more I would like to have money outside of anyone's control. Maybe gold, jewels and convert to/from dollars would be sufficient for me, I dunno. 
Anyway, in general, I recommend linking to similar tutorials that perhaps explain some aspects in more depth than you explain. For instance, the links in the sidebar

Gotcha. I missed that part. Thank you!

It's OK, it's just a possibility. Dude didn't provide any reason to believe the possibility.
That being said, do you think that I should use 3 layers of aluminum foil, or is 1 layer enough?
