Isn't the problem with this argument that inaction itself is what one side of the debate actually wants - i.e. they don't want the blocksize limit raised?  So "wait and debate" is indirectly siding with the conservatives. 
I'm sure those who want the blocksize raised would love to use time to their advantage, learn more, etc., but their very position is if we keep waiting, the transaction verification will logjam.
@_date: 2015-06-13 02:43:22
The technical reasoning is above my comprehension but I'm sure I've read the 'Raise Blocksize' camp say that by the time things get "demonstrably bad," it'll be too late. Making the pipe wider underground is only useful if you have a plunger to declog the toilet...so to speak.

PS4 owners hate Xb One owners. Yankees supporters hate Red Sox, etc. People get agitated and downright hostile when someone else has taken a stake in something they haven't. 
This is compounded by a taboo topic like money. Most people struggle to rationally talk about money because it's often a source of a lot of emotional turmoil and they've had little to no education about fiscal responsibility. (Debt concerns, family feuds, etc.) 
For most (western) people living today, money is also a very plain and straightforward thing. They don't think about where it comes from or what it represents, just that you need it and people with more of it are "better." 
Private currency sounds alien, let alone a private currency using newly invented technology. It sounds like a scam. Most people have no idea about the existence or uses of cryptography and simply don't trust computers. Hackers are all-powerful and anything computer-related is vulnerable...
You can't, for example, tell a regular joe that to "hack" a bitcoin private key, you could have 1 billion people, each owning 1 billion PCs, each computationally testing 1 billion combinations a second, and it would still take 2^45 years to reach the last possible key. The universe is 2^34 years old. They would say, "Yeah, but someone will hack it." (This math was stolen from the internet.)
Understanding why people ridicule/hate bitcoin is actually quite easy. How to change their minds... fucked if I know. I simply like to talk about it and I answer anyone who's curious with as clear and concise answers as possible and I make clear up front that it's new, it's risky, its future is unknown.

I've been reading about all the competing products in development in the second-layer protocol space and it does get over my head pretty quickly when you start digging into the tech details. 
I'm certain that second-layer services like trustless escrow, currency exchange, contracts, etc. are going to be the next major advancement for bitcoin as it introduces many new utilities that people desire. You can dismiss an alternative to online payments; it gets harder to dismiss an alternative to five other services you want, made cheaper and quicker.
The question for non-dev people who want to be involved (which will mostly be speculators looking to invest) is WHICH tech is going to rise above the rest? If you want to invest money and/or mining power, you're going to need to somehow pick which new layer to devote resources to.

There are many variants of libertarianism, but the one detailed to me by a self-described libertarian is that they believe in no regulation except for the enforcement of being protected from physical harm and protection of personal property rights.

1) There was no "problem" concerning social graphs and movie theaters in your home (which early television certainly didn't do anyway). Those things are only conceivable as "problems" with years of hindsight. Imagine a future in 40 years where all transactions occur through blockchain tech and people talk of the "problem" when you had to carry insecure, bulky physical wallets with paper and plastic inside? 
2) my original post said I'm not trying to convince people of the bitcoin currency value. I understand that's speculative and carries risk. I'm talking about the tech/protocol for transactions and many other uses (of which prototypes already exist).

This REALLY sucks. The only viable option I see is to use the seriously clunky method of a 3rd-party QR reader to get the bitcoin address, then copy-paste it over to coinbase.com or blockchain.info that you've pre-logged into on Safari. At that point, you're definitely not going faster than card/cash at a merchant P.O.S.
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:59:39
It's ironic that to get people to acquire the ultimate digital cash, both seller and buyer will be most comfortable with a face-to-face transaction at a brick-and-mortar establishment. 
It's possible a storefront like this could also allow purchases with credit/debit cards since it's in-person, they can check id. They'll still get some chargebacks, no doubt, but that's a cost of business that every merchant faces. 
I'd also like to hear of an actual legal proceeding where someone successfully proves they transacted bitcoin for an agreed fiat payment and did not receive it. Bitcoins may not have a classification but surely they fall under the umbrella of personal property? A court can't physically enforce the return of bitcoins but it can enforce a cash judgement at market value, just as it does with every other property dispute.

A very newb-style question: people often cite other alt coins like Litecoin as being far better than btc as a payment processor because their time between blocks is significantly less.
Is there something to prevent the core devs reducing the time between blocks for bitcoin, making appropriate adjustments to the block reward formula so that the monetary supply remains identical to the original distribution, (i.e. still ~150 new coins per hr, 21 million coins max by 2040, etc.)?

The volatility is raised again and again and again. In the OP merchant's scenario, he longs for the day when equal amounts of consumers and merchants are holding and trading in bitcoin. If/when that day comes, the price volatility is going to be far less of an issue.
Right NOW, it's volatile and risky, hence he chooses to insta-convert. It was risky starting an Internet company when many households didn't even have a home computer. 
How this threshold gets crossed... well, hopefully that's what the hundreds of millions being sunk into new bitcoin products and services are going to solve.

Email was headed to being unusable in the late nineties when spam was overrunning inboxes and no mail server-side solutions were doing the heavy lifting preventing it. 
Obviously getting some junk mail is different to losing your wealth, but there are tons of practical commercial solutions to the problem you present. 
Bitcoin is a competitor to the monopoly on money. There's no reason companies can't emulate banks by providing insurance in exchange for higher cost to store if that's what some individuals want. The likelihood is there will be many different service levels while others will choose to store it themselves.

As intriguing as your questions are, the idea was really just for a standard dollar-based CU, but one whose core mission is to provide basic financial services to customers that are being turned away by big banks. 
I'd suggested full reserve since I think it better matches the political ideals of bitcoin owners who are sick of a debt-based economy. Since its not operating for profit, small fees for checking along with deposit-based loans could keep it afloat. (I SAY CONFIDENTLY WITH NO IDEA)

How is this defensible? "Right to refuse service." Can the electricity company do the same? Water? Transportation? Why can banks refuse service to law-abiding, tax-paying residents for openly discriminatory reasons? We're not talking about loans here.

Er, you made two replies to the same post, but to respond to your statement here: "Who hates fraud protection measures?" Obviously, EVERYONE wants fraud protection, but there's a cost of convenience vs. security.
I can't count the amount of times over the years I've been in a store and my card's been denied because of automatic algorithms that decide this could be fraudulent - I then spend 15 minutes while the rep calls the credit card company and I have to answer security questions. 
When I leave the country, I have to call my cc company and warn them I'm doing it otherwise the card will rarely work.
This wouldn't happen with a bitcoin transaction. How can you say "Not. One. Damn. Thing." If there was no bitcoin/USD fluctuation, how can you say bitcoin really wouldn't be a more convenient payment process for online and brick-and-mortar transactions?

And this is the core of it: "Bitcoin is a solution looking for a problem." 
1) Did Facebook and Twitter solve a "problem?" Did television? Bitcoin has a similar potential to *improve*, if not fix. But the difference is that the early adopter crowd which would typically embrace new tech before its potential is fully realized, are generally reacting in a threatened way or find bitcoin distasteful. I just don't get why.
2) On the subject of fixing, there *is* a problem. Banks using your deposits to gamble on unsafe investments is a problem. Paypal freezing your account is a problem. Exorbitant fees are a problem. Target serving up 90 million potential identity theft cases is a problem.
People love the convenience of a plastic card to buy things and they accept (but universally hate) the inconvenient fraud protection measures and their personal info sold to marketers. Bitcoin solves this. I can order food online and pick up at my local restaurant without having to give my name, address, email, phone number, cc number, and CVC code. This saves me time filling out a cumbersome form and makes me feel better knowing I gave the merchant the only thing it needed: payment, not details about my life.

Instead of painting a scenario of this theoretical person in the future, I find this easier:
If BTC/USD is really at $100,000 (or some other arbitrarily high number), that means it has global ubiquity at a similar level to fiat today. People living during those times won't be asking themselves if they should take on the inconvenience of using bitcoin over their native currency -- merchants everywhere accept it, people are paid in it, government receives taxes in it. Fiat may still exist but it's seeing rarer usage, similar to how checkbooks still exist but don't see much use in general trade.

People like yourself seem to dismiss that upending an established industry of its monopoly (on money) has no benefits because "they'll just start screwing us over with bitcoin loans, too."
Paid a long-distance phone bill recently? What about the world of knowledge at your fingertips for free?  Competition is GOOD.  
Even if unscrupulous practices of the old tech gradually infect new tech, it's going to be a long, heavily scrutinized road, and many companies in old finance are going to die or get competitive. This is a win for the consumer, even in the first world. 
I'd bet the same people so emotionally against bitcoin are the same who blame immigration/welfare on why the middle class have no jobs/pay too much in taxes. The Republican media machine has convinced a nation of struggling upper working class that the real enemy is not them, but those who are poorer. "We create jobs!" they cry. They also create record corp profits, tax shelters, executive bonuses and criminal indemnification.
Bitcoin evens the playing field. It has the potential to redistribute wealth from a centuries old guard and rigged system - and it doesn't take oft-demonized socialist government policies to do it.

Technology advances often cut out middlemen, both facilitators and regulators. I think the idea is that the bureaucratic middlemen in legal services and in government are about to get a ton of their inefficiency automated and find themselves out of jobs. They'll leave kicking and screaming, but popular sentiment changes. You say we have a legal avenue for doing settling large asset transfers, but I can tell you firsthand those legal avenues are expensive, often corrupt, and becoming less necessary.

You HAVE access to your bitcoin because blockchain.info runs a web wallet, but YOU have your keys. This is something no bank can offer.

In 2 years, maybe every business does accept bitcoin. Does his (and many other naysayers') opinion change then? If so, concluding with an absolute like "it has no intrinsic value" is dumb. 
The dollar's intrinsic value is it's backed by the US government ("Our money is valuable because America, army, liberty!"). Bitcoin is backed by a cryptographically secured network of massive computing power that has no single point of failure ("Our money is valuable because no inept or corrupt human intervention!").
Which is more valuable? Well, the market gets to decide. But to argue it's *valueless*, a "mirage," is just ignorant.

It's good in that a bunch of infected machines are no longer compromised or providing free cycles to bitcoin miners. It's bad in that it confirms MS is able to remotely remove software from your machine without informing the user.
The benevolent scenario here is MS can seamlessly improve people's security without them being required to take action. But should any one company have *that* level of control of your machine? Not even a *prompt* to tell you what it's doing first?
If the software in question is defined as virus/malware, that seems good. But who's regulating that definition? Microsoft. Note in the article, they uninstalled the Tor service, too, even though that wasn't the actual source of the malware. They justified it by saying that it was an outdated version of the service and it won't auto-update, so it represents vulnerability. They're probably right, but again: why not provide info to the user on what you're doing/done?

All but the most extremist libetarians believe in two key pieces of regulation: upholding personal property ownership and protection from physical assault. Publicly funded enforcement of this would be permitted. This has nothing to do with intefering with "free markets." Free market does not mean permit theft or fraud - there can be no market if transactions and asset ownership isn't upheld.

How does an image file make your computer part of a botnet? This occurs when the image is loaded in a browser? Or viewed in an image viewer? 
Also, can you get infected if you solely use a non-administrator Windows account and you don't type the password in at the UAC prompt on anything not 100% trustworthy?

If every merchant accepted bitcoin, it wouldn't be less convenient. I could leave my house without a physical wallet and just carry the phone I'm already carrying. I wouldn't need cash or credit cards. Bitcoin tech could even be used as id.
It's inconvenient NOW because it's not yet adopted. Email was more inconvenient than faxing or mailing a letter when it required you to buy a modem (and a home computer possibly), a second phone line, and pay a monthly service fee.

He agreed to accept that Paypal's review of a case would be final and binding. Where's his proof that they did ANYTHING except auto-deny his case and then charge a settlement fee higher than the amount in dispute? 
Assuming OP's truthful, he disputed only one case out of many and did it with a particularly suspicious case. He can probably prove the user not only made these purchases knowingly but gained the benefit (time played since the items were purchased).
I'm astonished people defend this industry.

Would you accept through a direct bitcoin transaction or plan to do it through a processor? Curious because without fiat exchanging hands, wondering how the law views it, what enforcement would take place upon disputes, tax implications, etc.

Instead of scanning a private key to sweep the funds, why not allow the user to import a private key for use? I might be misunderstanding how CoinPocket works but I'm nervous of using it because there's no way to backup the key it generates outside of a device backup. He even says an iOS update will wipe it. Is there a downside to creating your own private key offline and using that?

But the wallet backup in Dropbox is AES encrypted. That isn't enough to "voila, we have your coins". Also, did you use the double-encryption Blockchain offers? (Second password for signing)

It seems a little pedantic when people hear someone say bitcoin has no fees and get up in arms that it DOES have fees. The joke in this comic is that there are organizations and people in the middle of payments/transfers that are raking exorbitant fees. The 8c you voluntarily pay for a bitcoin transaction to happen expediently is so absurdly trivial. 8c to send $10 or $10,000,000. 
If I bought a $200,000 listed house for $100 and ran around saying, "I just paid *nothing* for a house, it was a freak bargain," would you say, "Well, ack-tua-lee, you *did* pay *something*."

It's funny that delayed bitcoin transfers get me so antsy... meanwhile, a bank taking 3-5 biz days to settle a transfer is the minimum. I guess I'd be more freaked out if a direct transaction out of a desktop wallet was screwy because who would you contact then?
This is still no excuse -- I can't believe Coinbase can get the exchange so right but the wallet speed problem is obviously not isolated judging from other support tickets and reddit threads.

Not sure anyone will ever see this, but thought it's worth updating that Blockchain support got back to me and noted this thread:
The gist is if you have Watch Only addresses in your Blockchain wallet, the iphone app will try to send money (unsuccessfully, hence the error message) from those addresses when you use the Send transaction. You can avoid this by manually defining the "From" address.
Not ideal, but there's nothing Blockchain can do about it because of Apple's BS policy.

Wasn't necessarily happy with the definition, just pointing out that AFAIK it *is* news that the govt. has defined bitcoin as *anything*.
I'm sure this has been done to death but looking at the following three definitions (I USE TEH GOOGEL):
commodity: a raw material or primary agricultural product that can be bought and sold, such as copper or coffee
currency: a system of money in general use in a particular country
money: a current medium of exchange in the form of coins and banknotes
I think it's clear it's a new entity that defies any of the above labels but has properties of all of them. If the govt. doesn't want to create a new definition and would rather label it for the greatest revenue benefit... well, SHOCKING! :)

I use Coinbase.com. It was no more or less convenient than opening a bank account, i.e. it required an id check and a way to fund the account.


I don't understand your point. All things being equal -- i.e. a merchant accepts credit cards and bitcoin, then there's no difference in the consumer experience. 


Your entire argument seems based on "it doesn't exist right now, so it's f*cking awful!" Some people like being told how things are done and some like to define how things are done. I'm sure you've been subjected to the countless arguments about how most technologies through the centuries start out ridiculed/demeaned until they become ubiquitous. 
It is inarguable that bitcoin provides a method of value transfer (be it currency or property ownership) never before possible. I happen to believe that will make it a mainstay tech. You can disagree, although I'd advise not to disagree on the merit of "none of my local shops take it so it's stupid!"

Bitcoin is not priced in US Dollars.  It is a unit enforced by mathematics and cryptography; its value is assigned by people who choose to purchase it from someone who has it. 
The other common argument is that "wouldn't the adoption of  Bitcoin just transfer wealth/power from one small elite group to another?" and to that I say: disruption is good! In the long run, the new power will start to degrade and corrupt, but better that be an event in the future than something we have here and now.

I never said you could do that. You actually can have a "life," not sure what your definition of full is. There's plenty of journalists who have done the "I lived for one week on Bitcoin only" tales.


"A system that meet our needs today?" OK, who are you talking about?
Developed world consumer who wants to make payments at a physical merchant -- no particular advantage over credit card but no downside either
Developed world consumer who wants to make payment for digital good -- once you own bitcoin, it's actually more convenient. At each merchant, you don't have to sign up for an account, provide name, address, email, phone, credit card no, etc.
Developing world citizen -- there's countless advantages for the unbanked, for those relying on remittances, for those under corrupt or oppressive regimes
Ultimately, I accept an argument from you that "I don't see what bitcoin does for ME that it's worth MY time."  But what's factually incorrect is saying things like Bitcoin is priced in US dollars. Use it, don't use it. There are a couple million people around the world using bitcoin today and hundreds of millions of investment money going into applications to make it more useful tomorrow.

What incentive does the Greek govt. have to help the population easily buy bitcoin? And as for starting its own cryptocurrency, who would want it? Whether you're printing fiat or printing crypto, it could be equally worthless. 
The key reason bitcoin is perceived to have value over fiat is because of the mathematically enforced 21 million coins hard limit and known rate of supply.
