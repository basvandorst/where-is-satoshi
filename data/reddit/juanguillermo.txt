Agreed. A team should work to try and integrate LN channels and wallets with major vendors: Amazon, eBay, Apple.. etc. 
But who? Who is going to work on this? What's the incentive, wheres the direction? That's the problem; everybody is shouting how great Bitcoin is because it's decentralised and evolving organically, etc.. but it also looks like Pancho Villa's army: no real command, no direction, everybody (miners, developers, users, exchanges.. ) looking for themselves fighting their own little wars. 
The truth is: Bitcoin is failing in implementing its main use case, as per the white paper, i.e. *"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash [that] would allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another"*.
But nobody seems to care.

Andreas is a scholar, and Roger is a con artist. 
At the very least, even if you have no money in BTC or BCH, by listening/reading to Andreas you'll learn a lot about why Bitcoin is needed (read The Internet Of Money) and how it works (read Mastering Bitcoin). 
By listening to Roger Ver (nothing to read here, since the guy hasn't written anything) you may learn something about the human condition: the sad fact that lots of money can't turn a douchebag into a half decent person.

Lots of people now think they know what bitcoin is.. in reality most don't go past the "electronic cash" concept. The real benefits of bitcoin: security, decentralisation, deflationary., etc.. elude them. 
Case in point; I tried to explain a friend of mine how bitcoin cannot be forged, and how in that respect it's safer than fiat money, and I failed miserably... He still doesn't trust "videogame coins" as he calls it. 
 So yeah, bitcoin rings a bell in many people, but to what extent they truly understand what it is, remains to be seen.

but some BTC will be bought or sold as a result of futures being traded. Futures are usually used to hedge positions in the underlying (and viceversa). We'll see some volume increase for sure, although the net result is impossible to predict. 
The effect of the introduction of futures trading on commodities is usually a volatility increase, but Bitcoin is not a normal commodity and volatility is already very high, so It's difficult to say.

You are right, but I guess that the cartel controlling BCash will try to hold the BCash price by taking the other side of the trade, i.e. selling Bitcoin (which they still have a lot) and buying BCash. In the long term this is not sustainable of course but in the first hours or even days we'll see a lot of market manipulation, it's very hard to predict what will happen really.

no, you're right. And I agree with your point. I was missing the " scenario where BTC makes up 50% or so of monetary worth". In that case, the non inflationary currency may indeed pose some problems to the overall macro equilibrium. 
The thing is I don't see that happening, for me Bitcoin is not really going to be a world currency; Bitcoin is, above all, a technology that allows the decentralised transfer of trust, I see it becoming more like a new digital gold standard with various technologies built around it,  some of them may compete and/or replace current fiat use, but I really don't see fiat going away anytime soon.

Could be:
 "Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile. Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better".

Your second point: you are confusing *asset* inflation for *economic* inflation.

The Winklevoss ETF was an appeal from a 2 year old application with a 1 year old denial.  The initial denial was bc of lack of regulation/security. The addition in the appeal was that “Bitcoin is hard to manipulate” for a variety of reasons (which I agree with).
The Van Eck SolidX CBOE ETF is not related to Winklevoss, and this ETF has the best chance of approval. They attacked the manipulation/security question by adding onto the Winklevoss answer of “its hard bc its global and 24/7”.
The Van Eck CBOE argument was that they will be purchasing OTC from predominately regulated institutions (that do AML and KYC). OTC is more sophisticated and harder to manipulate. Great point.
The pricing mechanism they will use for Bitcoin will be from those OTC regulated entities. This pricing mechanism will be publicly available. Again, another great point. 
The ETF will be subject to the same CBOE surveillance rules as derivative products and Commodity Trusts.
The CBOE Van Eck ETF will also have insurance to protect against security issues. Another huge new development.
The Van Eck ETF is also designed for sophisticated institutional investors with a high minimum. It was be incredibly difficult and costly to manipulate. To buy it you need 25 BTC. It is for “hedge funds, private wealth managers, family offices, HNW”.
In conclusion the Van Eck CBOE Bitcoin ETF directly addresses the reasons why the Winklevoss ETF was denied. They make both compelling arguments &amp; designs in the ETF to mitigate the risk in the Winklevoss ETF. The Van Eck ETF still has a high chance of approval in 2018.
