I'm not amused by Krakens shitty trading engine.

I frequently trade btc and alts and usually have about 6 charts open at any given time. There is definitely a correlation between any fiat devaluing and the subsequent btc pair spiking.

I still see this awkward scenario developing where people hoarding BTC and refusing to use it causes it's price to surge but true adoption never really happens while if people start spending BTC there is selling pressure from companies converting to fiat.

The cost of transactions is usually carried by businesses/visa. This is why retailers typically have a 10$ minimum if you say want to use debit/credit. In a decentralized market that cost will probably shift to the consumer and erroneously believes the majority of people will just take that on the chin (they won't).

Frequently in tech the second mouse gets the cheese. Just look at the level of conversation in "alt" subs vs here.

Consumers are still ignorant to it

because a turing-complete store of value is fucking retarded and nowhere near vitalik's vision

it's not about like or not liking, you realize buying btc with bcc isn't actually putting any market cap into crypto, ahh you know what never mind pump that shit as much as you can going to be a great short

Ahh mate Berkshire Hathaway literally just approached me to explain to them how to make a GDAX account. Buffet himself said buying up 10% of coke was easy enough but couldn't really really wrap his head around market and limit buys so i explained to him that only 21 million BTC (+/- however many multiples of chains we get + the other trillions of cryptos everyone and there doge is coming up with) will be made. Like he said gold was for pussies because unlike BTC it can't be forked into gold2.0 or gulld or gould or geth. holy shit things are about to get epic
