Yeah, I'm gonna agree with you. Bitcoin has some flaws still with the way it is currently mined. The problem is this community will pretend like nothing is wrong, and never sovle this issue. Hopefully we'll see Intel, Samsung and other enter the ring

Digibyte has ASIC, GPU and CPU mining. You'd need to gain 93% of one of its algos, and 51% on the other 4 algos to successfully create a 51% attack. It has currently 2 ASIC friendly algos, 2 GPU friendly algos and one cpu friendly one. Even if the GPU algo is compromised, they can't make a 51% attack.
Also, ASICs are FAR better in terms of perf/hash, which is true. However, perf/hash=!network power consumption. The extra $/hash and perf/hash would allow one to have simply more ASICs economically on the network. You don't save energy by going ASIC.

You didn't ask for any suggestions, although I'm more than happy to share a few. We could adopt something similar to digibyte, where we an algo for Asics, for GPUs and a separate for cpus. That way our network would be more robust.
 Also, we could go ASIC resistant, or have more competion in the ASIC field. 
Bitcoin in its current form has things that worry me a little.

Yeah, I rememeber the good old days when a R9 290 brand new was $250 for reference, and $300 for aftermarket. (When these were new)
Now it's the same price before GPU shortage, and $400 used after the shortage. Same exact GPU.

Same here.

What an asshole. I know he's not satoshi, but if he is, dear god
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:23:02
I love PoW though. Its economically better. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 04:41:01
I'm worried. He said he trades a fifth of his portfolio a day?

Bitmain has 7nm Asics 
@_date: 2018-06-28 01:56:12
And we have tether 2.0 tethered to USDT which is tethered to USD. What could go wrong 
@_date: 2018-06-25 04:32:40
No, Bitmain gets them first. I can't source an article, DYOR. (My first time pulling that off)
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:40:25
Bitmain has new Asics on 7nm. They're far more effiecnt than the s9. Once they roll out the cost to mine will drop, and rise again once everyone has the same hardware ( difficulty rise)

Inception 2.0 and tether 2.0 together then create a whole new economy 
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:15:19
Then Facebook creates false bitcoins which are accepted in the VR game they made. Tether 2.0
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:19:31
Then why can't they do a simple audit ?
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:54:15
So isn't legal though.

The money becomes worthless. History will repeat itself.

I want to see how BTC is in one year 
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:29:37
Gold can crash too. Bitcoin just crashes and rises far faster.
