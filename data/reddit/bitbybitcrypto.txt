you can buy a vanilla visa gift card too. I've been out of the P2P game for awhile now so I don't try to fleece anyone if I run into the occasional newbie who just wants a few satoshi or whatever. Doesnt bitfit make it easy to buy coins now though I thought?

I’m sorry it takes so long to some countries. I am looking into using another service such and FedEx or UPS for international shipments. If anyone outside the US but gets a lot of shipments from here have experience with what seems the quickest for international shipping feel free to reply. Most of my international orders are UK and Canada and those are usually pretty fast but we will ship anywhere and it does really vary.  Another thing on international orders is that o declare the contents as best I can legally to avoid the buyer custom fees if possible. If you do want to make an over seas order and have experience with how To get your items through customs best we are always available via on site chat to work it out. 
Happy Holidays!

Online vape retailer vapecrypto.com offers a full time 10% discount off every order paid for in Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies. As of 11/25 we accept Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and DASH and support for more alt-coins is coming soon. Also, for the holiday season the crypto discount has been increased to 15% until 12/31 at midnight. We also usually allow the crypto discount to be combined with any other offers that may be available at the time so savings can sometimes be much larger then the 10 to 15% base discount. We have had many happy repeat customers who pay with Bitcoin and are looking to open up Vape Crypto on Open Bazaar 2.0 by 2018!

The KeepKeys sold out but hopefully we will be getting more in a couple of weeks.  The Trezor offer will be corrected, it should show the listing is for a 2 pack. That will be corrected today.
Thank you
