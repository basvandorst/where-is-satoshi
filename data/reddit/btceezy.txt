I find with ponzi scams the one major component of their downfall is the idiot running it never quits while they are ahead. They just keep scamming until they get busted.

The really big deal to me at least is that even small businesses can participate as publicly traded enterprises, which was virtually impossible before with the time and expense involved to get on a regular stock exchange.

The big picture is basically that their ponzi scam has come to and end and they fucking know it. I'd have a hard time acknowledging that too probably. Their hubris has bred entropy. 
Bitcoin represents a bold new idea that is sprouting a ground-up movement to take back control of our monetary system that is code enforced democracy. 100 years of financial darkness is coming to an end. The shysters are being replaced with computers.

Because it is still better than having ZERO exchanges in the US. 
And as you said, its a surveillance state, what are they getting from these exchanges that they are not getting from Facebook, Twitter, email, and millions of other websites that people keep their private information on? 
If you want to interface with traditional banking you have to play by their rules for the moment. If you don't agree than feel free to hang out at some other shady foreign exchange run by who-fucking-knows that might just run away with your funds.

Keynesian dogma is all they teach at Harvard business school and the like, so you are totally right. It is nearly a religion to them that is infallible.

“Let me issue and control a nation’s money and I care not who writes the laws.” Mayer Amschel Rothschild
That son of a bitch is really the root cause of what we have today. Most don't even realize the banking takeover of governments has been ongoing for 300 years. The Federal Reserve Act is how they did it to America, written into law by the most powerful bankers and industrialists under cloak. President Wilson even stated later that he realized he just ruined his country by basically selling it to the bankers. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 19:29:38
Not at the moment, I'm just buying for now. 
Bitcoin functions as a currency as well as a stock asset, but I am of the opinion that until there is real price discovery for goods and services in Bitcoin it should be viewed as an asset more than currency for now. 
I have spent in the past, however I have always been 95% an investor more than anything else. I am hoping that someday it will be like investing in Google in the early days.

I think you did pretty well.
Bitcoin is really, really hard to explain in a sentence because it is such a radical and novel idea. Bare in mind most people don't even know how Dollars are created let alone some magic Internet money that is completely foreign.
Its really easy to get far too into detail when you're talking to a complete layman as Bitcoin represents so many financial concepts its a lot to take on in one shot.
Best approach is give a practical example of what it can do that will get their attention. Make them want to start asking questions about it. Usually I go with "If I sent $1,000,000 to a bank in China with a wire transfer, it would cost me 10% and take a week to get there. Bitcoin can do the same thing for less than 1 penny in fees and in under 1 hour to anyone directly anywhere in the world, at any time." That usually gets some raised eyebrows :D

World War 3 is already going on. However unlike past wars, this war is all economic. Shots have already been fired by the US, Russia, China, OPEC, etc.
Bitcoin is another warhorse in this new currency war. 
At the end if it does come down to violence, it will not be between countries, but between people and their governments/rich oligarchs.

Fun fact: The first two banks to try to usurp a young America were the First and Second Bank of the United States. On the third and final attempt, they called it the Federal Reserve for just this reason that people would think it is a government body, when in fact it is a private banking cartel with roots 300 years in the past. 
Jefferson staked his campaigns on killing the first two banks knowing full well the scam the oligarchs were trying to pull, which he succeeded

That too, the distribution of risk is amazing with this.
Instead of one VC making a risky million dollar bet, you can get 1 million people to give you a dollar. If you fail, everyone is just out a dollar. P2P lending may well revive our crumbling small business sector where the majority of us do not have the means to get a bank loan or get VC funding to start something.

@_date: 2015-02-06 19:50:56
Not quite.
If you really want to trace it down for the modern era, its actually about 300 years which started with the Rothschild family taking over banking in Europe, and when the American colonies were founded they started trying to take that over too, which they eventually did in 1913 with the passing of the Federal Reserve Act, signed in under stealth and created by a cabal of the biggest industrialists and bankers at the time. That was effectively when America was sold to banking interests by allowing a private bank to issue the nations money.
Lincoln's Greenback was actually an attempt to take back control of the money supply by issuing debt-free money from the state. I think that is actually why he was assassinated in the end. 
Though before that, the moneychangers were running their gold scams and economic manipulations in ancient times. In world terms, banking fraud has existed a very long time.
Through my own research on financial history, the only conclusion Ive really come to that for our entire history, banks have always been a scam. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 22:56:20
Sure, but what i mean is Bitmain and Spondoolies are just part of a small few that are actually reputable. 
But do you think anyone stung by a scam would sink even more into mining at this point? 
As said, mining isn't "dead", but the community seems to be battered and slowing way down. One metric I look at is Group Buys on Bitcointalk. Once there was a lot of activity in there, and now there is practically none.

Back then there was no Microsoft, no Coinbase, one amateur exchange of any note, and a financial industry that was laughing at such a concept ever becoming serious. 
Bitcoin is right now a multi-Billion Dollar business with vastly hardened infrastructure compared to just a couple years ago, it is not going anywhere. Bitcoin has only grown, and will only continue to along with its inspired brethren like Storj, Counterparty, and others which were also not even ideas just a few short years ago. 
Anyone who thinks Bitcoin will die after $400 Million investments last year is deluded, all of that will be coming online this year most likely making Bitcoin better than ever. The engine has been built, it is now we are discovering what we can do with it. 
The banks aren't laughing anymore. Bitcoin is a serious threat to their defacto monetary monopoly.

Bad news in Bitcoin typically equates to the source of it going bust, which is good.
Bad actors need cut out like cancer, and many of them have been. Each bad news cycle cleans up the industry a bit. We can then leave embarrassing amateur hour operations like Mt.Cox in the cold ground where they belong and focus on whats next. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 19:37:00
Think of it this way: most people don't know how Dollars are created, they won't really care how Bitcoin's underlying mechanisms work either. 
And the truth is Bitcoin is not just currency, nor asset. It is a protocol which is even more beyond comprehension that unifies many economic and banking concepts. Really Bitcoin is programmable business. 
Tell people how Bitcoin can solve a fiat problem for them by finding out what that problem is first. Unless a person can see how it personally benefits them to try using Bitcoin, they won't really care to when the fiat they've known and used their whole lives can do it just as well for them. 
International remittances is one where Bitcoin shines over other options, as an example.

Probably a bit more efficient but as you get smaller the performance gains get smaller too. For a large mine this can make the difference, but for retail buyers at home they still won't be profitable for the price.

This is the distinction between bitcoin the protocol, and Bitcoin the branded network.
It is the same difference between how Google Chrome =/= Internet. The bitcoin protocol is meant as a base layer like TCP/IP, where wallets and other services are the "browser" so to speak.  
This will be a problem for a while though I think. For most people when they hear of a Bitcoin company getting hacked and whatnot, they think Bitcoin *itself* got hacked, not the business only utilizing the protocol.

I think modern Keyensian economists are religiously devout in their system and see nothing else. The FED is the Vatican, consumerism the faith of the people. They know nothing else, they accept no other alternatives to their monopoloy because it is the only thing they know.

LTC/DGC were never scams the same way as many of the altcoins turned out to be, but LTC is basically dead to me at this point.
LTC has failed to develop anything that would make me want to use it over Bitcoin. The big pitch was that Scrypt made it much more ASIC resistant, but ASICs came anyway. 
The truth is LTC will never, ever, trump its big brother. LTC doesn't solve anything Bitcoin hasn't already. I still have a warm place in my heart for LTC as the first and still largest altcoin though. 
Also now look at the network effect in action. VCs arn't flocking to Litecoin and giving them millions of dev dollars. Any dev worth a damn is working on Bitcoin stuff, not Litecoin/Dogecoin, they go where the money and jobs are. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:07:22
I think they may flock to cryptocurrencies as well, as the option we never had before. 
Bitcoin vs gold is a dumb argument overall. Bitcoin does emulate certain features of gold, but =/= not the same thing. 
Anyone who thinks the world will just move back to gold currencies is delusional as heavy, hard to protect, ship, and store gold is not ideal for global or personal commerce. 
We need a new financial system, and at the moment Bitcoin, and blockchain tech, is the only option. Otherwise the moneychangers will just implement a new fiat scam to move to after their old ponzi finally burns.

Considering the gold paper markets are totally manipulated, the real value of gold is likely highly undervalued, as well as silver.
Generally the price of gold adjusts eventually to currency expansion, which every central bank has been doing for the past 10 years or more. 
We'll see soon enough where people go when fiat markets start collapsing, which I would venture a guess will be either precious metals, and/or cryptocurrencies. If nowhere in paper is safe, where does one put their wealth?

No one has any patience at all. 
ETFs take a very long time to get approved, especially ones like this as a Bitcoin ETF has never been done which will add even more SEC scrutiny. 
I imagine building licensed exchanges takes a lot of time too at least in chomping through the regulatory process. This isnt a Russian fly-by-night exchange that could just walk away with your funds any day, this is a regulated and insured entity. 
I agree, everyone should chill the fuck out or build their own if its not good or fast enough.

Well, no one will be pre-ordering I can guarenfuckintee that.
Mining is a really dreary scene I've noticed lately. Trust is at rock bottom. Hardly any new products, miner sales appear to be stalled, even the scams seem to be letting up. Hashrate isn't really going up which to me means no new deployments = no one buying. Add to this the simple fact it is difficult or impossible to profit without wholesale prices, mining isn't dead but its *dead*. I was planning to open a new mining shop but have changed my mind because I honestly don't think I could sell the machines. 
I suppose you cannot really blame anyone for not trusting jack shit when it comes to mining companies. We've been rocked by scandal after scam after scam for over a year.

It isn't what I want to hear, I think this statement is completely accurate.
We've had basically the same monetary system for hundreds of years. Each one seems to end with a total collapse of the society that used it. Bitcoin and the Internet are combining into a tectonic shift in how we do business with each other in a decentralized way, which until now was never before possible.
Is Bitcoin perfect? No, nor will it ever be as an ongoing development.
