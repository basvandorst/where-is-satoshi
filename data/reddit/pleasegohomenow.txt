You cannot be this dull. If I meant all governments, I would have put the word "all" in front of "governments." Learn how conversational language works, man. I specifically referred to *my life* in both statements. I was providing a specific example.


Good luck getting changing "attitudes" to get around people's self-interests and greed.

For the record, I never made a "strong claim" of any sort. Rephrasing my original statement: my life now is better than it would be if government I live under disappeared. My claim referred to one location at one point in time.
I would, however, argue that while technology can change, it's much more difficult to change human nature. Loss of religion, I think, is a reaction to a changing environment, brought on by technology. No doubt technology can negate the need for government, but I think we are more than a few decades away from anything like that.

A stateless world looks like a world that is a few years and a few bloody conflicts away from being made up of states. And it's really a crapshoot whether it's a benign state or tyrannical state that pops up. Much nicer to have a stable government that by and large lets me go about my life than to live under that threat.

1. Government has made my life better than it would be in its absence.
2. The people fighting Bitcoin are doing so because they think it will hurt the economy, not because it is your path to freedom.
3. You are not making this Bitcoin thing appeal to mom and pop with talks of "war". You guys are going to lose this thing before it even begins if you don't tone it down.

Maybe not mom and pop, but an average joe-redditor learns about Bitcoins and visits for the first time with some questions. He sees this on the front page. What do you think his reaction is? Is it positive?
