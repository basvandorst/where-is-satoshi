The bank sale is a lot of smoke and mirrors. 
First no foreign investor wants to buy this Icelandic bank. It has been for sale for 7 years now and no buyers. So now the government is pushing for the Icelandic pension funds to buy the bank. 
The Icelandic pension funds lost about 50% of all their assets in 2008 because of the banks in the collapse. 
To make a long story short this is a PR trick on the Icelandic people. Use the peoples pension funds to buy the bank then give each and every one something like $250 for draining their pension funds.

True, the challenges are enormous. The people that are working on the Auroracoin project are all 100% bitcoin fans. 
The trouble with Iceland is that there are currency controls in Iceland and people can't exchange the Icelandic krona for USD to buy Bitcoin. This is the main reason for the Auroracoin project.
When Auroracoin was launched back in 2014 the coin was distributed to the Icelandic population. The coin was hyped before the distribution and got a lot of attention and of course many sold the coins for Bitcoin in the aftermath.
Nevertheless over 10% of the population own Auroracoin and while we live under currency controls we are trying to spread the idea Auroracoin and crypto in general. 
Everything is in place for this to happen in Iceland. The local currency is in ruins with decades of inflation and devaluation, currency controls, high internet usage and everyone has mobile phones, but the most important part is that everyone here  understands the consequences of inflation and how the banking system works.

UBS paid for it but didn't have any influence on the content of the documentary.
