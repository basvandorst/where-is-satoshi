I dunno man, you'd be surprised how many people still run Windows
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:11:41
You had me going for a second there. Nicely done!
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:13:05
It's more like explaining a pyramid scheme to a hedge fund manager but okay
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:43:06
Seriously, where is the moral victory in this HODL stuff?  It's like a religion.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:19:37
I'll do you one better: don't buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:18:18
Yeah, if only these people would build something real instead of circlejerking about their computers...
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:15:16
You know, ostriches don't actually bury their heads in sand. It's only a cartoon thing.

you mean the Amway shill who never made money in the market and got sued by his co-author for representing his incorrect and illegal advice as coming from a certified professional?

@_date: 2019-07-01 21:44:58
much legit.  wow.
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:59:07
Nobody should do it because it uselessly sinks viable computers that could be used in education in the undeveloped world
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:57:35
No, pretty sure that's Filthy Frank
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:36:33
Don't we? I have a pretty good idea.
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:28:43
One wonders if perhaps you might be stupid?

Pink lemonade is made with beets.
As in, BEETCONNEEEEEEEEEECT
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:41:11
... which is a name for making money.
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:40:37
whoa whoa, actual investor behavior?  must have been a fortunate accident
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:47:39

what is it with you people

This happens to be the business I'm in, and the emotionalism is truly insane.  One guy had the payroll department lower his bonus slightly so more of the rounded cents figures were favorable.

set your RemindMe's people
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:42:36
No, not seriously. It's exactly the same improbable nature that should have tipped this off as a fake post.
@_date: 2018-04-14 16:59:31
exactly: stupid Youtube sheep staking in and inflating the bubble.
@_date: 2018-04-11 01:05:14
almost the entire market was hacked or stolen with Mt Gox so I'd say you were yet another bored teenager lying on the internet

Do you ever go back and read the comments telling you to turn back?
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:00:10
Now that bitcoincirclejerk is using the same header as the main sub it's really confusing, I almost thought this was r/bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:37:16
But he's right. What point is there whatsoever to any alternative currency other than crime? This is just Reddit Island all over again.
