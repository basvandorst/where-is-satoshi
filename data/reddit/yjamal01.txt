Likewise. Extremely frustrating to just be scammed like that.

Yea man have you ever been on it? Never known a drug that bad. It literally ate up my insides. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:43:00
Honestly, I didn't expect more than that from strangers on the internet. At the end of the day I have a roof over my head and food to eat, so I have it better than most of the world. 
Just wanted to share my story because I feel like its one of those "Oh shitttt that sucks" stories, and it just feels good to share it and hear other peoples perspectives. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:45:06
Maybe not but it felt good to share it with the world regardless
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:22:33
Thanks man! Haha whats your username? Mikehodl as well? 
Hopefully you made it big my friend!!!

LOL never took any of those. But man real depression is something else. Things you find pleasure in dont make you happy, endless feelings of misery. 
Never really knew what REAL depression was like until I experienced it myself. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:50:06
thanks man, these are the kinda replies I was hoping to read. Cheers
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:42:48
Nope just sharing my story, people should feel sorry for people who have to live in war torn countries, poverty, etc.

*I just got scammed 62 ETH using Cointal. Anyone with any advice please let me know.*

Hey  
Do you use telegram? There is a group of victims in a telegram group. I could add you. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:29:55
Sure once I find some time. Basically it said they were discontinuing my financial services, what I need to do, and how I could call a number and leave a message if I had any questions and I would get a call back in 1 business day. That was almost a week ago and I have yet to get a call back
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:31:32
seems to be the case 
@_date: 2014-03-28 16:27:48
If you want to be a Bitcoin Trading company you would have to register as one - and none of the major banks are letting bitcoin companies bank with them despite having corporate accounts
@_date: 2018-05-29 21:43:27
if you were truly honest you would offer the info for free.   
Do you know what it is like to have all your Ethereum stolen from you? To feel so stupid and feel so crap you want nothing but for it all to end?  
If you were  a good person you would not be "selling" this info. You would be offering it up in the name of justice.   
Even if you had the real info, I would not pay for it. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:30:25
You are lucky. In Canada that's not going to happen. Bank can refuse anyone or everyone service. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 20:55:06
the amounts are well under 10 000 - they are my mining profits from my jupiter 
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:16:49
No that is not the correct answer actually - I had accounted for it. They had me come in and account for it. 
It was AFTER I accounted for it and that it had come from Bitcoin that they shut me down. Also banks are rejecting any bitcoin related business in Canada. Just ask cavirtex, cryptosafes, or canadabitcoin
@_date: 2014-07-11 21:00:57
I am located in Canada 
@_date: 2014-07-12 17:05:49
I sell via local bitcoins there is a trail and I abide by AML laws in Canada
@_date: 2014-03-28 16:26:16
Pretty much happened to me bank shut down my account even though I proved I was not violating AML laws
@_date: 2014-03-20 03:56:09
So now Scotia has dropped them too. How many days until RBC drops them and bill payment into cavirtex is no longer an option?
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:51:15
Yup exactly. People are trying to say I violated AML laws but I did not they knew I was selling bitcoin and even after I stopped they still shut down my account.
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:28:45
I brought in receipts for all my transactions - I provided proof for everything going in and out of my account 
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:31:08
unfortunately my in person transaction volume is extremely small/non existent 
@_date: 2014-07-11 21:01:50
money gram blacklisted me because I was receiving several transfers from the US (customers buying BTC)
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:17:16
@_date: 2014-04-17 05:02:13
what is vault of satoshi? is it like local bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:31:42
Are you in Canada? How do you receive deposits? 
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:29:00
So did Scotia
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:52:19
Unfortunately there are not many options in Canada - all the big bangs seem to work together and have the same opinion of BTC. If anyone knows any BTC friendly banks I would love to hear








@_date: 2014-04-02 19:05:07
so just an update. TD finally called me back after a week of leaving messages.
I asked them what I did to cause them to close my account so I know not to do it with my next bank. I was curious why my account was closed as I provided receipts and was within AML laws. 
The answer? (paraphrase) We are not going to elaborate beyond the letter - TD conducts reviews of their customers periodically and based on this review we have decided to discontinue all your existing/future services with TD.
@_date: 2018-10-13 14:43:15
etransfer payment, bank wires, etc.
@_date: 2018-10-14 19:36:15
the 150k was before i had these levels of fraud protection
@_date: 2018-10-13 14:44:40
do you have an article regarding this?
@_date: 2018-10-13 14:43:48
I do KYC on all orders for fraud prevention
@_date: 2018-10-13 14:11:21
All depends if they recognise the payment or not I guess. Quadriga currently in a lawsuit with CIBC
@_date: 2018-06-07 01:59:23
hey man, whats your telegram ID?
@_date: 2019-10-23 02:01:44
Cause I had known him for about a year and though he valued his name and reputation so assumed I would get paid back. Thats not the issue here. The issue is that the platform I met him on will not allow me to warn others and what is the point of a p2p feedback system if they  don't allow people to leave feedback regarding an individuals trustworthiness?
@_date: 2019-10-22 19:10:24
Well the specific LBC trade led to a point of contact to which he scammed me. LBC was initially where I met him, and his profile on LBC is what led me to trust him.  
Sure they can't ban him, that is understandable because it was outside the platform. But to not allow me to share my reason for not trusting him is asinine
@_date: 2019-10-22 16:48:12
yes but I should be allowed to leave negative feedback....they aren't even letting me leave feedback regarding it
@_date: 2019-10-22 18:02:47
A contact signed with him and selfies from him and his passport is not sufficient? Their feedback system is to leave feedback. I left feedback.  
Im not looking for a path to justice...im looking to warning other people so they dont get scammed.   
This guy needs to be exposed and localbitcoins should allow feedback to be shared and should not restrict feedback especially since nothing on their site says this.   
The feedback says distrust and block. Which I do. Why does the site restrict me from sharing with other traders the reason as to why I distrust and block this user?
@_date: 2019-09-19 20:03:55
because it was a loan and not a buy or sell transaction. It was a loan with someone I knew outside of lbc who also had a reputable profile on lbc
@_date: 2019-09-19 20:05:28
neither, loaning
@_date: 2019-09-19 21:33:45
Yea, I would never trust a random stranger like that without trusted escrow...But I had done it before and even had a friend who knew him more personally who had done it...so I trusted him
@_date: 2019-09-19 17:43:55
geeze that is definitely ironic =(
@_date: 2019-09-19 20:02:46
very true
@_date: 2019-09-19 20:05:22
I do know who he is, we have a relationship outside of LBC. I have loaned him before, and he paid back. I even know the lawyer he used in setting up his intake forms for KYC compliance, etc.   
however, I was also once scammed by a friend for $40k...and lets say the civil legal process is extremely slow and largely a waste of time for relatively smaller amounts. I don't want to waste more money I cant afford on a lawyer, unless it would be pro-bono or payment received after recovery
@_date: 2019-09-19 20:03:14
to be fair this has nothing to do with localbitcoins but more about how i trusted someone due to the fact they had a reputable profile and I knew him outside of the site
@_date: 2019-09-19 17:43:40
Honestly I should have known better, I have a bad habit of assuming people are good and that they value their reputation. Unfortunately, i've paid a hefty price to learn the hard way that this is definitely not the case.
@_date: 2019-09-19 20:03:29
exactly, people like this hurt the industry
@_date: 2018-04-28 20:10:51


no idea, but if you ever pay anything by etransfer you can easily reverse it by claiming your account was hacked. Had that happen to me back when I used to accept etransfers. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 15:51:49
Yea it may be the cash deposits or large transactions that got me flagged. And then i think once one bank flags you they contact the other banks and they flag you as well. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:24:04
true - but with reversing an etransfer its not that you dispute the product you receive. Instead you dispute that you ever sent the transaction (ie you say you were hacked)
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:20:51
definitely agree and that is probably what it looks like. I mean I stay within reasonable amounts. Most deposits are $1000-$2000. 
However it might be I was victim to a third party deposit scam. I do request that when a buyer uploads a receipt he writes on it the unique transaction ID + both our usernames and no refunds.
This has now occurred to me as a possibility. 
1. Scammer opens a trade with me
2. Gets someone to make a deposit and give them the receipt as per my instructions
3. They upload the receipt I release the coins
4. The person who made the deposit goes to the bank saying they never received their bitcoins for a deposit they made
Now this would require the person making the deposit either be extremely naive, or in on this scam. Because I doubt anyone would follow those instructions without having a great amount of concern about receiving their coins.
@_date: 2018-04-28 19:55:05
yup, they would have banned me for not telling them what the transactions were for.
@_date: 2018-04-28 20:50:48
Yup most of these online dispensaries accept that as a payment option. 
Difference between that though is there is a shipping location. With btc I am sending a virtual item. 
The individual can claim his account was hacked and that the btc address was not his. No way to identify the exact person the coins were sent to.
With a tangible item you can just track to where/who the item was shipped to.

Thanks, not holding my breath but praying he grows a conscience and comes through
@_date: 2018-04-28 18:02:22
Last month was about $45,000 in ... $35,000 out. 
Month before that was $10,000 in ... $25,000 out.
All transactions are done through LBC for my own logging purposes and escrow for protection
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:32:36
lol, if only right? 
@_date: 2018-04-28 17:54:49
it wasnt asking about "a" cash deposit though. it was asking about each and every single cash deposit which was way more than a gift from a family member could explain. 
my mistake was doing it in the frequency and volumes I did.
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:30:50
I have BMO still and credit unions. No more bitcoin transactions for me (except maybe cash sales I guess but those are few and far between). 
Just have to hope BMO doesn't ban me.
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:40:22
No idea not going to risk it though. Apparently banks have the right to ban you if they feel your account poses an "unacceptable risk". 
They could deem any involvement in crypto as unacceptable risk and then ban me. 
Not a risk I think I am willing to take. I will likely withdraw p2p with cash or cash withdrawals and suffer the withdrawal fee.
