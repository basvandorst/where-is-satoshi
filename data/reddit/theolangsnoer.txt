I'm looking into the Jaxx Firefox extension right now.

I used wesellcrypto.com and it worked out fine for me.
@_date: 2016-08-18 19:13:22
I bought 0.02 BTC at wesellcrypto.com and paid with PayPal. Works fine.

Yes, a scam forced upon every country and controlled by private central banks. It is the biggest scam of mankind.
@_date: 2016-08-27 19:51:05
Like putting a letter without an envelop into the mailbox.
@_date: 2016-08-11 19:21:12
Is this safe? It looks so "unprotected".
@_date: 2016-08-16 07:06:03
How about wesellcrypto.com? 
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:58:14
Banks like to have control over things they cannot control. Hmmm, sounds impossible :)

No way. Decentralization is the main security thing for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-15 21:10:48
Well, I guess that when 1 BTC is worth like $300,000 you probably pay $1000 for a loaf of bread.
@_date: 2019-11-18 05:30:49
Indeed. BTC will probably increase in value but the USD will definitly loose much of its value.
@_date: 2018-10-29 05:07:38
This time you will be a lucky bastard.
@_date: 2017-01-12 19:49:37
Does a wallet creates this extra transaction explicitly, so you don't loose all your remaining bitcoins to a fee for the miner?
@_date: 2016-12-27 20:12:00
Maybe because about 4-5 years ago you could get 1.38 USD for only 1 EUR. Since then, slowly, the USD got more expensive.
@_date: 2019-12-04 17:43:02
Only if the dollar crashes in the next 5 years, which is quite likely.
@_date: 2016-09-09 06:35:08
How about anonymity if you buy BTC with your ABNAMRO account? It might be a way to keep track of your BTC-activities.
@_date: 2016-09-10 23:24:30
Smart. Could have figure this out my-self. Anyway, for as long as I live, I do not have to worry. 
@_date: 2016-09-10 01:08:05
Any success yet?
@_date: 2016-09-10 23:21:00
But decentralization is the core idea of the blockchain. A centralized blockchain is not acceptable, is it?
@_date: 2016-09-06 18:54:06
I bought 0.02 BTC at [WeSellCrypto]( without sending an ID and paid with PayPal.
@_date: 2016-09-17 21:24:12
I installed the Firefox extension version. Haven't used it yet. Don't know if it's safe.
@_date: 2018-07-07 17:49:06
Looks to good to be true. Scam? Be careful!
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:17:22
It is not about corrupting the blockchain, it is about retrieving the private key that belongs to a public key. With a quantum computer you could take any public key and get the private key in seconds or minutes.
@_date: 2019-09-21 06:32:32
How many keys can be hacked before people are aware of the fact that slowly more and more bitcoins are being stolen? How long can hackers operate under the radar?
@_date: 2017-07-29 07:16:51
Savings on an exchange? From which planet are you?
@_date: 2017-07-29 07:12:12
Everyone can check the balance of every BTC address. That's how it works. You didn't know???
@_date: 2016-07-31 06:55:10
Not everyone can afford buying all the time. I need to sell at some point, wait for the price to go down and then buy again.
@_date: 2019-05-24 03:35:33
Oh, btw, now you can use your laundery money to pay your AT&amp;T bill as well, LOL.
