Bitcoin isn't for niggers, quit trying to make something valuable free and cheap and then ruined.

First of all, Marshall "Fat Muffin Man" Long is not near the big daddy bitcoin miner that he likes to make out that he is. At best, you might call him a consultant who used his Chinese waifu to develop and maintain connections with the Chinese miners. He's the eyes and ears in the West for some of the non-English speaking Chinese miners.. that's it. If you [check his post history here on reddit]( you can read about his concerns that his waifu was going to leave him. So distressed by this, he took to snooping on her email and Facebook messages. This totally sounds like a guy who respects the privacy of others and that you'd want to do business with.
Secondly, his [business dealings with Josh Garza]( (Long was working on PayCoin off the books so as not to upset his other clients) were so intertwined that he was sweating twinkies in fear of the SEC. He told Garza that the "SEC is going hard" last year amongst other things. He's arguably still on their radar, but being his grease content is above 90%, he might've slipped away, but I wouldn't bet on it.
Thirdly, the guy is massively obese. Now, as the sophisticated redditor you presume yourself to be, you may claim that I'm using ad-hominem attacks and will now sit back as if you were a learned professor of Latin, but please consider that anyone as grossly obese as Marshall Long is lacking in self-discipline and self-control which just happen to be 2 qualities crucial to being a sound businessman.
Lastly, and I cannot substantiate this as I've never personally met the man, but I have been told he gives off an odour, likely due to the difficulty in wiping his bottom.
It would appear reddit doesn't allow new accounts to post link, or at least the subreddit.
