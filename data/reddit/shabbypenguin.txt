ETH has been having more tx's than BTC before the kitty game and now with the kittens the network is being bogged down and fees are still worlds better than comparatively than BTC's. i just paid 50 cents for a TX with 56 gwei (14 times larger than normal).
not saying that eth wont have ana issue but its not really the same to btc's fees in the dollars+ section

its a massive tx size all  things considered but for the currency of the future getting 7 $1 tx's to you shouldnt cost so much to send it out as one.
i hold 0 bitcoin at the moment because of its day to day usability for me, but im hopeful for a day when things can finally become cheap enough again.

max out CAH's donation matching while helping school kids get supplies and field trips!
also worthwhile is take some time, do some xmas shopping and show up for toys for tots/fire stations etc. donating to a big charity is great, but the personal interaction of seeing someone's day just get that much better is even more thrilling IMO.

~~right, but the point of this thread is how to sell BCH, not BTC.~~

Saw it on TV, the video was removed by dmca from E-Trade. Seems like it was indeed official

Hm, I did it to the same address as I thought splitting amongst addresses would have cost more as each "address" then paid its own fee to send. that really sucks that I now have effectively "lost" this money.

This is a screenshot of exodus wallet in which I currently have $12.14 in that I have earned using various beermoney sites. all sent to the same address, why is the tx 2KB and thus $23?
this is absurd. exporting the wallet to jaxx solves nothing, still says it would be absurdly expensive to send half the fee amount.

don't trust this wallet

this is it, thank you for the explanation. loaded up my  wallet in electrum and set the fee to be lower. paid $6 in fees and will probably take all day, but it at least consolidated now.
