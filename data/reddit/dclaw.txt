False. The majority of online retailers want you to open an account for your shipping info, and to advertise to you in the future. It has nothing to do with payment.

Make sure there's still BTC on it. These were cracked nearly a year and a half ago. 
Edit: And yes, I realize that implies cracking the case, peeling off the sticker for the key, etc... I guess a better suggestion would be to track the provenance of the coin to assure it was sealed before the security was compromised last year.

Apparently someone got it?

And now I know there's an easier way to check the balance! :-)

This is great. Is this your video? Any info on that 'lnvend' poster in the back? I've been trying to get a vending machine project off the ground for a while, and lnvend.com isn't live.

crypto means cryptography! :-)
Also, with the official release of Libra... you can now add Facebook to the banks line.

Yeah, and don't forget to ACTUALLY VOTE too... because that shit is more important.
@_date: 2018-11-06 18:14:17
No, it actually doesn't. Not in the political realm. Vote against central banking, inflationary currencies and the like by buying Bitcoin.
Vote for the laws and morality of your country by voting for government office and propositions.

I'm sorry, but they cannot do that. They are required to hand over all funds at this time, and then refer you to collections if such chargebacks/refunds arise. FIGHT THIS. They cannot steal your money to use for their own investment (and make money from) beyond the date of the termination of your account.
