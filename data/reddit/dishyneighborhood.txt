Banking on bitcoin is a documentary about it

I think it’s a bit risky 20k was the last ath so there’s a chance it absolutely obliterates the resistance but a pullback is equally likely 
Regardless I’m holding bc I think eventually it will break 20k and go higher, trading is uneccecarily risky imo

Im holding on for the ride, but to me this feels much much faster than 2017. Cautious optimism

Buy some bitcoin and make paper wallets for them. Either hold onto them yourself and give it to them when they become adults or give it to their parents to hold onto.
This is a great idea actually and I may do this for my godson

This is ridiculous, that was what bitcoin was supposed to compete with. Also its not losing badly, its a new player in a huge market, I don't think BCH is the best currency out there and don't own any. but this "digital gold" crap is not going to last forever. Sure it can stay like that for a while until everyone realizes that their "digital gold" is a landline when there are iphones in the market. Why does nobody else realize this?

You got ripped off on your GPU rig then?
@_date: 2018-03-15 01:20:23
There’s a difference. Millions of GPU’s mining would level out the mining farms power. Unlike ASIC farms which are incredibly expensive initial investments.

This is why u always hold, I went from 15x to 3x and now back up to about 6x. Just hold, this market is still so tiny. Give it 2 years and anyone invested in a decent crypto will have a ton of money

Are you very new in this space? Not that that is a bad thing but this is a very basic question, it’s the $200 btw

Its asic resistant, decentralized mining. R/vertcoin to learn more. Also vertpig.com just launched as a direct GBP-VTC exchange, vertbase is also coming which is a USD-VTC exchange. Both community driven

The answer to an obvious problem
