I'm more of a trader than a user. But my actions will help stabilize the currency.

Reason?

Thanks. I have a coin base account and quite a bit of stock experience. I've been back checking some graphs and think I have a simple model to do some day trading. I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything in that process. 
I'm verified with gox but they don't have my bank info. I'm level 3 with coin base but was waiting to find a trading platform.
So to recap. Bitcoins bought in coinbase. Bitcoins sent to gox. Use gox to day trade and increase investment. Transfer bitcoins back to coinbase to sell and cash out.
I don't see a problem here but I'm not familiar with gox. Do you see anything I'm not?

Honest question. Could I send my bitcoins from Mt gox to my wallet in coin base and cash out like that. For instance. Buy 200 in coins on coin base. Transfer the coins to Mt gox. Use it as a broker  account and day trade.  Then transfer coins back to coin base to cash out?
