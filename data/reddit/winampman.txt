Actually, a reasonable, manageable amount of debt is more efficient than no debt at all. The reason is that the US gov't enjoys one of the lowest interest rates in the world. Example:
US borrows $1000 at 1% interest, invests it into the US economy/infrastructure. Gets back $1000 in tax revenue. Now it has to pay back the $1000 loan + $10 interest. Now ask yourself: Is it more efficient to A) spend your $1000 tax revenue on paying back $1000 + $10 debt or B) keep the debt, reinvest the $1000 tax revenue on more economy/infrastructure, and only pay $10 interest? Obviously this is an oversimplified example but you can see it is better reinvest money back into the economy, than it is to pay back this debt. 
Of course, if you have $1000 debt, and you're paying like $300 in interest every year... then that is very inefficient and you should pay back that debt. That's what happened to countries like Greece.

They actually only own about $1.1 trillion out of our $19 trillion debt. Which is a lot, but a lot of uninformed people act like China owns 10 times that amount. In fact, total foreign debt amounts to only ~$6 trillion. The largest single holder of our debt is our own government, which is a good thing because that makes it very low cost.

The CPI is not measured or managed by the same exact people who administer social security or other payments. The CPI is measured by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) which is under the Dept of Labor, lead by the Secretary of Labor. Social Security is a fully independent government agency not under any department or Secretary. 
You are implying that there is a shadowy conspiracy where the BLS colludes with their friends in other agencies to understate the inflation rate. If that's what you believe then fine. I am just providing this information so other people can decide for themselves what they want to believe.


"The CPI market basket is developed from detailed expenditure information provided by families and individuals **on what they actually bought.** For the current CPI, this information was collected from the Consumer Expenditure Surveys for 2013 and 2014. In each of those years, about 7,000 families from around the country provided information each quarter on their spending habits in the interview survey. To collect information on frequently purchased items, such as food and personal care products, another 7,000 families in each of these years kept diaries listing everything they bought during a 2-week period."


That is necessary because product usage changes, products are discontinued, and quantity sizes change pretty often. The important thing that the categories remain consistent. For example if one cereal is discontinued, replace it with another similar box of cereal. That's still a valid measure of what people are paying for cereal.

Probably new ad buys from the advertisers that you mentioned, since bitcoin has been getting a lot of attention recently.

More accurately, the first two predictions have been fulfilled. But even a broken clock is right twice a day so we'll see about the next one in October...

Why don't you figure it out yourself? It's just basic math.
Apple's market cap (925.9B) divided by the number of bitcoins in circulation (17.809M)

Just buy a little at a time until you have 1 btc. There's no reason to buy 1 whole btc at once.

False, the company never never specified how much was taken in their announcement. They only said 17% of their funds were taken.

Yup, the Litecoin halvening in August 2019 had almost no impact on price. Everyone knows about the halvening in advance, so the price will already be adjusted for it by the time it happens.

If the demand curve for bitcoin remains **constant**, then yes you are correct: the halving would indeed increase price. That's the assumption you're making in your examples with water and apples. 
But demand curves are not always constant. So for example, if half of an economy's apple supply is destroyed, and at the same time, a research study finds that apples cause cancer, this will cause demand to drop, and the price of apples will remain the same or even go down despite the fact that half of the apple supply has been destroyed.
Back to bitcoin - a lot of things could affect bitcoin demand. If major retailers adopt bitcoin next year, that would increase bitcoin demand. Or Facebook could release their cryptocurrency, and it could become massively popular and make bitcoin obsolete - that would decrease bitcoin demand. These things could cause bitcoin price to shoot up or crash after the halving. 
For the last 2 halvings, luckily there was no bad news for bitcoin and demand growth remained healthy. For the next halving, bitcoin now has a lot more competition and the demand may or may not hold. That's why the next halving is not a guaranteed price increase.

November happens in 5 days (actually 6). There's a prophecy that BTC will hit 16k some time in November. It could be fake, but who knows. It got a couple of other prices (roughly) correct but those could have been lucky guesses.

37% in one day? wtf is going on?
@_date: 2019-08-22 04:11:58






These are clear 100% cause and effect. But what about:
Halving -&gt; price increase?
That may or may not be true because something else could have caused the price increases instead of the halving. We don't know for sure.

There's a theory that Hal Finney is Satoshi (or half of Satoshi, if he had a partner). And Hal Finney is dead and cryogenically frozen.

Yes they had an outage around the time of the dip:  [ 
It's also normal and expected. BTC dipped $2k in 15 minutes. Everyone was freaking the fuck out and constantly refreshing and trying to buy/sell on the dip. Things were crazy and their servers couldn't handle it.
