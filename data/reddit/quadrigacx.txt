If you're looking for a wallet when in a rush, Rushwallet is a great choice. It may seem like a centralized service, but its anything but. 
Wallets can be generated offline, coins can be recovered even if the site is down, and Rush Wallet has no access to your private keys. 
The only things that would make it better would be
- Multisig support 
- API redundancy with another block explorer such as blockr.io

No, it is not a bank.

If you're looking to show Bitcoin companies that you actually understand how Bitcoin works, C4 is where you want to be. In the near future, QuadrigaCX will be implementing a policy whereby a CryptoConsortium certification is a prerequisite for employment.

Is buttercoin registered with fincen and a registered money services business in all of the states it supports? 
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:23:01
Is it though?
Buying Bitcoin isn't one of the reasons that the Government of Canada deems acceptable for a bank to refuse a client. Due to the way that the Canadian banking system is set-up (oligopoly), there are supposed to be protections in place to prevent this kind of behaviour.

There's another one powered by QuadrigaCX in "Decentral.bangtown" at the corner of Richards and West Pender.

One easy way to do it is to download the Blockchain.info app and then hook it up to the QuadrigaCX autosell system. It takes about 5 minutes to set up, and then you can withdraw funds directly to your already existing bank account. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 00:02:22
If you sign up to QuadrigaCX and sell it, you can withdraw via Interac E-transfer, which will arrive within hours. No verification is required if you are just selling.

There are numerous Bitcoin ATMs that do not require verification information and that charge reasonable rates. I have compiled a quick list of the ones in Canada that I can think of off the top of my head.
Bitcoin Decentral ATM in Toronto - 7% fee - No ID required 
QuadrigaCX Skyhook ATM at Dueling Grounds in Toronto - 6% Fee - No ID Required
QuadrigaCX Lamassu in Gastown in Vancouver - 5% fee - No ID  Required
Lamassu ATM at Steamrollers on Robson in Vancouver - 3% fee - No ID Required
Bitcoin Solutions ATM in Saskatoon - 6% - No ID Required
Bitcoin Solutions ATM in Edmonton - 6% - No ID Required
QuadrigaCX Lamassu at Bangtown in Vancouver - 5% fee - No ID required. 
Bitcoin Solutions ATM in Sherwood Park - 6% - No ID Required
And this is just the first few that come to mind. There are dozens of others scattered across the country, most of which do not require ID verification. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:56:08
Quadriga CX is new and has a limited amount of order in the order book, however we are definitely the best option for Canadians at this time. While we are currently in "Beta" we have no fees. 
In regards to community history, our directors are members of the Bitcoin Coop and have strong roots in the Vancouver area. Unlike other exchanges, you can actually visit our offices in person in Downtown Vancouver.

The issue also isn't payments, its the fact that each TV show has different ownership rights in different countries. That's why some shows are available on Netflix Canada that aren't on Netflix US or Netflix UK.

Generally speaking, Lamassu and Skyhook models do not require verification.

I second that they are not a company that you want to deal with. I once filled up my shopping cart and then wanted to see how much shipping would cost. Because it wasn't shown on the main shopping cart page, I clicked "Proceed" to see what it would be. I got a call a few days later informing me that I had entered into a legal contract to purchase the contents of my shopping cart and that if the price changed they would hold me legally responsible for the difference. They have all sorts of shady business practices.
@_date: 2014-07-18 02:51:05
Bet they're regretting their poor choice of jurisdiction right about now. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 02:03:08
We apologize for any negative experience that you may have previously had with QuadrigaCX and appreciate the fact that you've changed your mind and decided to continue trading with our company. 
Aside from the fact that we were out of the office when you visited, are there any other customer support issues that we can address?
Thank you for your ongoing patronage. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 23:37:38

Western Union has all sorts of weird rules that make it troubling to use. My least favourite is when you send a payment, and then when the recipient goes to collect it, are told that they cannot. If they weren't going to send the payment, why did they take my money?
Its one thing to refuse a customer, but to accept funds and then fail to remit them demonstrates a particular level of scumminess. I don't think we'll see it right away, however it would be nice to see Western Union come to an end. They've been exploiting clients for far too long. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:28:10
Thanks for including QuadrigaCX in your review. As one of the largest exchanges in Canada, and the largest on the west coast, we are working to improve our services based on everyone's comments and suggestions. 
If anyone has any questions, I'm on reddit throughout the day, every day and usually respond to private messages within a couple hours. 
Great List! Thanks.

I saw them in Amsterdam at Bitcoin2014. They look a little boxy, and I'm not a fan of the user interface on the screen, but other than that they seem to work well. 
They have both the KYC model and the non KYC model depending on your local laws.

This machine is only for buying Bitcoin. If you wish to sell Bitcoin, the best way to do so would be through our online trading platform.

Interesting. I guess that's only in America. Banks in Canada would never ask for that. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 01:06:15
I'm not quite sure if this is a joke site or not. An exchange built on wordpress? lol

It is not a bank. 
@_date: 2014-07-03 16:27:04
Awesome. So the only person who claims to have used it also claims to have never used Bitcoin before, and joined reddit 13 minutes ago, and then fails to explain what the "product" is, other than stating that it is well designed. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 16:11:39
The thing people don't seem to realize is that no AML laws require you to give a palm print. Has your bank ever asked for a palm print? Of course not. We had the same issue here in Canada when the Robocoin was introduced. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 23:31:39
QuadrigaCX here. It would be appreciated if you could add us to the list. We're currently one of the largest exchanges in Canada.

True, however the CBC is owned by the Canadian government.

Our Bitcoin ATMs are only one way, and because QuadrigaCX is in Canada, our ATMs use Canadian Dollars, instead of USD.
@_date: 2014-07-23 20:10:05
With credit cards the exchange either has to implement incredibly tight verification requirements, or charge crazy fees to make up for the fact that a good portion of the payments that they receive will end up being fraudulent. On top of that, the credit card companies end up charging them 3-5% to process the payments. 
@_date: 2014-09-07 03:14:39
A much more likely scenario is that you end up with a collision due to foolish brainwallets, or the use of non-random address generators.

Accepting Bitcoin through Bitpay is a good first step, however ideally I think the Bitcoin community would like to see more and more organizations holding on to the Bitcoin and actually using it directly for operations, while avoiding traditional payment systems.
QuadrigaCX has just sent a Bitcoin donation via Cryptiv on Twitter. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 17:02:17
Wouldn't a better idea be to tell residents of New York that they are prohibited from using these services? 
If a business is operating in a foreign country, why should it be their responsibility to know the laws of every single jurisdiction around the world, incase one individual from that jurisdiction happens to visit their website? 
Certain things are illegal in foreign countries that are legal in New York. Does that mean that those foreign countries should be able to prosecute companies that are operating out of NY for breaking laws in foreign nations?
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:42:09
Yes, you should definitely move it. My suggestions are
Green Address - If you want something with HD wallets and numerous security features.
RushWallet - If you want something super quick.
Kryptokit - If you want an in-browser, plugin based wallet.
Or if you don't mind having it on your phone, then Mycelium.

C4, the Crypto Consortium  currently seems to be leading the way with certifications. Rather than focusing on things that already exist, I would prefer to see the Bitcoin Foundation focus on areas of the Bitcoin ecosystem that have been neglected.

I can't speak for the rest of the world, however I know that a number of QuadrigaCX users in Canada are using HSBC to fund and withdraw from their accounts without any issues.

With QuadrigaCX, we don't require ID if you send us a Canada Post money order. This allows you to fund your account with up to $999 without any form of ID and withdraw Bitcoin as soon as we receive it. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 12:00:29
Unfortunately in some cases we are required by our payment partners to implement certain restrictions and limits on new clients. After a few successful account fundings these restrictions go away, however they are necessary due to the Canadian banking system which seems to consider security as an afterthought. 
For users who wish to fund their account with a larger amount than our EFT limits, we accept wire transfers up to $500,000. Or for users who would like to avoid the verification process all together, we accept in-person fundings as well as money orders without verification. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:38:39
I would imagine that they have not obtained the proper licenses to operate in Canada.

It really depends on how many transactions take place. While the figure of 7 transactions per second is often cited, based on a more realistic kb/transaction size it is closer to 3 transactions per second. As long as people include a fee with the transactions, they'll eventually get processed, however there will end up being a large bottleneck. 
This bottleneck will eventually get processed, but depending on the volume of transactions that take place between 7 and 8pm tonight, it could drag on for quite a while. 
Based on the assumption that 3-4 transactions can realistically be processed per second, thats only ~2400 transactions per block. Seeing as the standard fee is 0.0001 it would only cost an "attacker" 0.24 Bitcoin per block to completely fill it with nonsense transactions. Now imagine that a whole bunch of people testing the capacity of the network try that during one pre-defined timeframe as discussed in this thread. We could easily have a situation where 100,000 transactions are sent, with an appropriate fee, all in a one hour period. In theory this would take 41 blocks to go through. Add in the usual transactions that are taking place on the block chain between exchanges, merchants, individuals an so fourth and you end up with a massive backlog. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 04:29:19
Our apologies that you experienced difficulty answering the security question. The transfer has since been cancelled and resent.

QuadrigaCX introduced an optional PGP encryption feature for all e-mail communication 6 months ago. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 15:42:23
That's correct. Canada Post money orders are easy for us to authenticate, so we generally are able to credit the funds within 24 hours, with no verification. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 19:22:00
Congrats Anthony!

Incorrect. The way we hash passwords locally before transmission protected us from Cloudbleed.

At QuadrigaCX, we make every possible effort to ensure that our clients
are completely satisfied. Unfortunately, from time to time, a client
comes along who is impossible to please. Upon realizing that it would
not be possible to provide this particular client with the level of
service that he demanded, we felt that the best solution was to sever
the relationship.  We wish him the best in his future Bitcoin
endeavours. When/if the wire transfer from this client is received, it
will be promptly refunded.

It isn't worth the risk. Coinbase is known for freezing accounts and then demanding ID information. Coinbase isn't a wallet.
