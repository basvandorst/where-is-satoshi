Im on that boat. Got in at $3800 and got a little over halfway. But the last .42 seems sooooooo far away now ��

Congrats!! And I can relate! I was told I was wasting my time with crypto but I got myself a $2500 camera and lens entirely with some of my profits! Enjoy the car!

Same here I was using Robinhood for a while and i was excited when i went up $10 in a week ��

Actually now that i think of it, it did double that time. But when I went back to screenshot it, it already went down and kept going so i had no evidence until now lol

I used blockfolio for this one. Theres also the Crypto Pro app which does the same thing and if you like keeping track of prices on your watch

Yeah finally probably isnt the word if it only took two months ��

Well you cant actually add your wallet. You just manually input the amount you bought and the price and over time it will show you how much total value of your coins and how much youve gained/lost

Man I WISH i started in 2013 lol that small investment has probably grown 10 times as much!

Honestly theres so much Ive regretted. I’ve bought at ATH’s when it reached 4k, 5k, and 6k and I would kick myself because it would dip that same day or even same hour. But now that Bitcoin is almost 8k it doesnt even matter anymore because all of those investments I made at 4-7k are growing. Anytime I start regretting how little I invested I just think either “I only had that much to invest at the time” or “you weren’t as confident in bitcoin yesterday as you are today”

Last time i was only up 98% before it dipped so i couldnt say it doubled then lol
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:06:04
well if you're confident enough that it will reach 10k then you might as well buy right now regardless

To all the people earlier this year that said it was going to the moon, I wonder what amount they were thinking it would reach when they said that.
