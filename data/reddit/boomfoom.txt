It is pretty much impossible to have a real conversation about Bitcoin in here.  It is probably because most users are invested in the subject, and this seems to really color their discourse.

you sound incredibly smart.

Totally agree, but I thought it was interesting that you needed some sort of license or approval to run an exchange and follow some regulations regarding anti-money laundering.
I didn't know any of that and that's why I thought the article was interesting.

Are you saying that Bitcoin is not a currency?  Because I think a lot of people on this forum have been trying to argue that it is.

Currencies do not have fundamentals and this is because they are not inherantly or fundamentally valuable.

government-granted certificates?
You don't know anything about economists or economics, do you?

Since I disagree with most of what you said, I'll just point out the parts that I agree with.


I agree.  I also agree with the part of the sentence where you mentioned that "nothing like it has existed before."


I'm not too knowledgeable about the technology behind bitcoin so I will take this as true as it seems to match what I've read about it.


This statement doesn't make any sense.

Currencies have fundamentals?  What is the Dollar's P/E ratio?

everything else.

&lt;Because the price of a Bitcoin in other currencies is literally the least interesting aspect of Bitcoin.
If money is unimportant to you, I imagine that you have money to lose.
