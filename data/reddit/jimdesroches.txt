Uh no, im not.  That had to be the most and quickest that’s left, that I’ve seen at least.  Doesn’t matter, they’ll be back, unless they bought bit connect, they may stay out.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:42:11
300 billion just decided to leave the market.  That's pretty insane.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:44:12
They had no way of knowing, it literally went up 1000$ a day for a week so you could of said the same thing at 13k and a week later they would have made 6k by buying at its highest point.  Shit happens
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:27:05
How would that not be shocking?  That would shock me a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:34:16
That’s true but there is a lot more money at stake now, not as easy to drop the market like it was.  If we see 1-2k I’ll be the guy selling my car to buy! Lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:41:22
I don’t think we’ll have to wait 4 years to see 19k again.  Personally I don’t think we’ll have to wait 4 weeks.
@_date: 2017-08-18 10:25:28
Well don't wait too long or you'll be buying back at 10,000 instead of 4,000! GL
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:26:21
Didn't it go from 4400 to around 3800 like 2 days ago?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:46:08

Ahhh thought I was still talking to the other guy.  I have a question for you.  I've been reading a lot about bch and how it is supposedly going to be more profitable to mine then btc soon.  If this happens and people jump ship to the other side, how will this affect everything else since it is all linked to btc prices?  Get what I am saying?  What if BCH becomes the coin worth 4000 and BTC goes to 500, won't all the alts be worth well, 1/8 of what they are now?
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:53:58
Bet a month ago you didn't think you'd be waiting for a dip to 3800.

I have been in crypto 3-4 months.  Never cashed out to fiat.  Once bitcoin got up to around 2950 I decided to sell since it was just about to near its all time high.  I figured it would fall back down and I'd make a few bucks.  Well it didn't.  It hit 3000, 3050, 3100.  I can't remember exactly where I bought back in but it was certainly at a loss.  Now the thought of doing it again scares the shit out of me.  Like one guy said; it works until it doesn't.

My buddy is looking to start accepting crypto at his vape shop.  Is their a reputable vendor to go through to do this?  He wants to be able to accept it but convert it to fiat easily (he’s not into crypto, this is just me trying to get the world to adopt).  There must be a vendor that deals with this or people will be waiting forever for their confirmations, correct?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:04:04
Thanks, I’ll check it out 
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:35:59
Buy it back, still 2 weeks until fork.  I did the same but decided it’s probably going to keep going up.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:35:23
My dad had been telling me it’s in a bubble since 2000$.  When I made 1000$ it was “talk to me when you’ve made 5,” when I achieved that, it was 10, when I hit that milestone it was 20, once I hit that he shut up.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:45:28
Why is the sentiment in here that bitcoin is going to drop soon?  Wouldn’t it make more sense for it to go up prefork and then drop right after?
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:09:11

The thing that I don't quite understand is this.  If ethereum has better tech and Bitcoin is "old tech", why is it that governments are talking about Bitcoin and why Bitcoin ATMs and not ether, why airlines to accept Bitcoin, not ether.  Why Japan accepting Bitcoin as currency, not ethereum?  I have both but was wondering why people think this is?
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:25:20
Complain about the fees and transfer times, would t the other cryptic be dealing with the same shit if they were dealing with bitcoins' problems?
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:54:26
They can keep printing money but doesn't it help that there is a max amount of bitcoins?  There is no max amount of fiat.  Plus I think the people that hodl will continue to hodl.  They are disciplined as hell.  I think taylor swift said it best in that song "The hodlers are gonna hodl hodl hodl hodl hodl, shake it up."  That's how it goes right  I don't know, I hate taylor swift.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:44:07
Ok I have a noob question that I'm sure a bunch of you can answer.  I've bought into bitcoin through coinbase, seemed noob friendly enough.  I've read a lot about bitcoin's scaling issues.  If there is a fork, how does that affect me as just a holder?
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:03:30

No risky no reward.  I didn't dump my entire savings into crypto, but yes I put some in.  I think it's worth the gamble.  I'm sure people thought the Internet was crazy too.  
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:37:00
Sucks for you but at the same time a post like this makes me happy.  I wonder how many other people are trying to buy but are just bogged down with exchanges that can't keep up.  I know coinbase was having issues, they kept saying my 3 digit security code was wrong, I was going crazy because I knew it was correct.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:20:19
Ethereum is following suit, I hate seeing it go down because I own some but love seeing it go down because I want more!  Oh the webs we weave.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:45:59
I was literally reading that article when it started to drop.  I was thinking "how many people are reading this shit right now!"
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:38:38
66 Bitcoin 33 ether, bought ether at 130, went up to 200, went back down to 130, bought more, now back up to 200.  I seriously have to delete these apps, price checking drives me crazy even when I know I am not going to sell.  I like to do the math as if I were to sell, though I know I don't want too.
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:12:50
I love it, people bought which was a good idea, saw the price dropping and sold which was a bad idea, all the holders bought those up.  Bitcoin will survive and will go back up again, I just hope that guy that sold his house to buy Bitcoin is playing it right!

Why do people always give other people a hard time about this?  It's almost like they don't want anyone else having any bitcoin.  Hasn't the trend always been upward?  I'm sure the price will correct itself but right now it seems to be increasing hundreds daily.  Maybe it's just going mainstream now or at least starting too.  With a market cap 1/20th of apples I'd say there is a lot of room to grow.  I like your decision!  HODL
@_date: 2017-07-23 10:44:41

I am a little confused as to why it keeps going up, I would of thought the opposite with August 1 looming.  And after head of ethereum meets with Putin, ethereum sits idle and Bitcoin rises.  Oh cryptos you tricked me again.
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:52:28
Doesn't it usually come tumbling down when it rises this fast?  Or is this different because so much money was waiting on the sidelines to come in?  
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:02:17
That's a good idea.  If it is always displayed, I won't have to make a special trip to check it.  Brilliant.
@_date: 2017-06-03 11:01:42
I wonder why it is going up.  Everything I read is about how ethereum is going to surpass Bitcoin and Bitcoin has scaling issues etc etc.  I'm invested equally in both but I'm not gonna lie, August 1st does terrify me a bit.

Maybe, I woulda thought the money woulda gone too ethereum since it's all the rage right now, Bitcoin vets are stubborn though, they may go back to fiat and wait to buy back Bitcoin

@_date: 2017-06-02 23:57:24
Most of these people that hate bitcoin are probably jealous they didn't get in early or just mad at themselves for not doing so.  Our world will go to digital currency.  We essentially already have it now with credit, debit, paypal etc.  It just sucks now.
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:33:29
Yeah it doesn't seem to affect my everyday life.  I can eat, sleep, socialize fine.  It is just like a magnet for me.

@_date: 2017-06-27 02:34:32
No one should root against Bitcoin.  I am all for alt coins with strong tech.  I go where I think I can make money.  I do however think Bitcoin needs to survive carrying Alts on its tried and tested back, at least for now.  Funny thing is I've been trading for 2 months.  I made an account  on 2 different apps.  One with my start of Bitcoin and ethereum, the other app I tracked all my trades.  I made some good trades and some bad ones.  After the correction today I check both apps, with over 10,000 invested the accounts were within 20$ of each other.  All the time spent learning and graph watching and contemplating, all to see that if I just bought and walked away would give me the same outcome.  I don't consider it a failure as I've learned a lot about the tech, icos, scams, and what I think the future will bring.  Anyways, just food for thought.
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:36:56
Yes I know that and I don't want to avoid taxes.  My question was do people usually do this when they are up or do they take their bitcoin and put it into a more stable crypto until bitcoins price drops, then buy back?

@_date: 2017-06-03 11:16:40
Isn't that when they address their scaling issues?  Seems the price can go way up or way down depending on the outcome or what they decide the implement.  Bitcoin now has competitors nipping at their back just waiting for a mistake.  Miners have a lot of power in Bitcoin and unfortunately they don't have the people's best interests, they have their own.
