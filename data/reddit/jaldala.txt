It is most probably a group of designers/engineers and after the initial introduction they all vowed silence and never made any more contact.
Pretty cool actually.
Interestingly there are untouched bitcoin blocks from the get go. They probably reserved "some of it" for themselves. Maybe in the close future they will make a transaction with those blocks and receive public attention.

What makes you say that  ?

Not exactly what I meant. What I meant was rich people don't care if they make any profit from exchange or buying at a discount. Unless they act super stupidly they always have source(s) of income. It is the middle class or (near) poverty people who are looking for ways to squeeze a dime.
Anyway they sell wedding rings to middle class people.
I think their idea is to look appealing to crypto enthusiasts. Having said that there might be a reason to accept crypto whether it be tax evasion or evading bank fees.

That is hell of a cheap for a tree. If I am not mistaken 1 BTC = 100 000 000 satoshi, 10 000 satoshi = 0,75 USD. That is pretty cheap for a tree in my book. Am I making any mistakes ?
And congratulations for your transaction.

I happened to walk by this shop this evening. It is from an expensive shopping mall. I wouldn't expect they would accept Bitcoin because they normally target rich and classy customers. It is interesting they accept Bitcoin because most probably their customers don't give any enthusiasm towards cryptocurrencies. By the way this was on a jewelry store.
Promising development regardless it is for marketing or enthusiasm anyway.
Note: this is Zafer Plaza shopping mall, Bursa, Turkey.
