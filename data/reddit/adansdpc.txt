The capacity of a payment channel is how much BTC can be sent over that channel in a single direction.
However, channels frequently tunneling transactions in both directions hardly run out of capacity, as values in different directions cancel out.
So, capacity defines the maximum difference between payments in one direction and the opposite.
Think of your bank account. You have inputs and outputs. Balance is inputs minus outputs. Capacity is like overdraft: what's the maximum "imbalance" that you can incur.

Those reckless enough to get into the game can start opening channels to random peers and helping the network to look like a mesh from the very beggining.

Credits to Also, needless to say: pioneers leading the way are awesome, but don't get overly excited yet.
There's still much to test, fix and improve before massive adoption is recommendable or even possible.
Relax and let LN developers do their work, we're putting too much pressure on them!

That's a perfectly feasible approach. Drivers for SDR chipsets found in commonly used DVB-T USB dongles may be even present in your stock Android kernel at this time. Only problem is Ku band uses reasonably high frequencies that suffer a huge decay from the satellite to your device, hence the need of a highly directional antenna (LNB + dish).
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:29:17
From what I know about mobile operating systems design, the hardware abstraction layer (HAL) and radio interface layer (RIL) of both Android and iOS would never allow user space software (apps) to access radio devices like the GPS receiver at such a low level.
Even if you compiled your own Android kernel and wrote a basic API for reading the raw signal from the GPS receiver as if it was a software-defined radio (SDR), there are still two big issues:
1. The oscillators in the radio of your device need to be capable of coupling (tuning) to the frequency of the signal, which for the Blockstream service ranges from 11Ghz to 12Ghz depending on your area (see "Ku band"). This is far away from the L1C GPS band, which operates at 1575MHz.
2. Same for the the planar inverted F antenna (PIFA) coupled to the receiver inside your phone. It will have very low gain values as you move even a little away from frequency it was designed for.
In the other hand, one could argue: why don't they just use the GPS frequency? Well, unless you are the US Department of Defense, emitting signals in the L1C GPS band constitutes a serious offense to the US Telecommunications Act of 1996 and many other international laws.

Actually, if I'm not wrong, that's a Spanish Dollar (Real de a Ocho) which was valued 8 reales. It was the first worldwide currency, and the origin of the US dollar (among many other currencies!). It is even said that the dollar sign ($) comes from the columns and stripes you can see in the coins, which in turn come from the coat of arms of Spain and symbolise the Pillars of Hercules (Strait of Gibraltar).

At first thought, I understood it differently, rather referring to the different branches of Christianity: Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Protestant.
The different forks (which they call "schisms") were even more traumatic than in Bitcoin, involving decades of wars and so forth.
For example, in the Western Schism, three men simultaneously claimed to be the true pope.
The Protestant Reformation had a different nature: the schism had place because the core of Christianity (Rome Papacy) refused to apply some upgrades on the consensus rules set by the heaven-ascended founder.
I guess all these stories sound quite familiar to many of you, don't they?

Now there are basic tests for the test vectors:

Please take into account that many transactions sent these days from SegWit-ready wallets may not be leveraging SegWit yet because all of their inputs are legacy non-SegWit UTXOs (BIP-0141 mandates this behavior). On the long term, most of those UTXOs shall be spent and locked into SegWit script puzzles (P2SH-P2WPKH, most likely). Then, any transaction spending those coins must abide by the new format.
Also, in general, I suspect we will see broader adoption when BIP-0173 is passed and we get proper native SegWit addresses (P2WPKH and P2WSH).

Funily enough, transactions coming into your SegWit-enabled wallet from legacy addresses can't leverage witness segregation. However, transactions leaving your SegWit wallet toward legacy addresses (P2PKH) must always use witness segregation.

Please refrain from suggesting that the separatist parties behind the referendum (ALDE+LI+EFA+CUP) are the same or even familar to the party ruling the City of Barcelona (GUE/NGL).
Also, I can't see how historical arguments on the configuration and ruling of ancient, extinct pre-Spanish kingdoms make any point on how our country should be configured in the future. Acknowledgement of former existence of a historic nation as a justification for deserved autonomy was neglected by us the people of Spain in the same moment that all the regions were given roughly the same treatment under Articles 143 and 151 of the 1978 Spanish Constitution (with the only exception of Community of Madrid, which had to resort to Article 144 precisely because of the lack of historic grounds for separation from Castile–La Mancha).
On the other hand, I totally agree on your last sentence: all this theater just tries to make us all look away from the outreageus crimes against democracy that the ruling parties in Catalonia and the rest of Spain have been committing (namely: corruption, embezzlement, banks bailouts, cuts on education, healthcare and social services, etc.)

Weight Unit.
After the SegWit soft-fork, It has replaced bytesize as a measure of how much space transactions take when put into blocks.
While the block size used to be 1MB, it is now 4 million WU.
Non-segwit transactions "weight" 4x their size in bytes.
Meanwhile, SegWit transactions always take less than 4x their size, because witnesses (signatures and the like) don't contribute to their weight. 
Depending on the proportion between the witnesses and the rest of the transaction, the difference between bytesize and weight will be more or less notable. However, using SegWit ALWAYS gives a smaller weight.
This the reason why more SegWit transactions can fit into a block when compared to non-SegWit transactions, and also why some people claim that SegWit increases block size in practice.
I visit  once in a while for live charts on the witness size per block and other insights related to this.
@_date: 2017-05-23 09:41:06
I do believe it is:
Of course it depends heavily on the bytesize of the transaction. It is our responsibility to compose the transactions wisely ;)
@_date: 2017-07-10 07:36:47
As for the why: some people say that some entities may be interested in artificially increasing block saturation in order to bring the scalability debate to the top of the agenda. If that was the case, they would had been using a despicable method to raise awareness about otherwise perfectly legitimate claims.

Confirmations just tell the number of blocks that have happened in the chain after the one your transaction was written into. Therefore 3 confirmations simply take approximately 20 minutes more than 1 confirmation.
That said, these days a 30000 satoshi fee should get your transaction mined in 12h or less, but there's always the risk that it gets lost in the pool. 45000-60000 is a sensible default in my opinion and it should take only a few hours to confirm.
In the other hand, near-immediate confirmation takes currently something between 75000 and 90000.
