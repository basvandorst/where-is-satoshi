Well for the bank account they apparently use to let you put your routing number instead of logging in. With Paypal, Paypal already asks for your SSN to verify, so they could just only send to verified Paypals. 
Google for example when sending money from adsense only asks you to prove that it's your bank account, by sending you money then putting the codes in, and they take it out, not login. Amazon even does this. 
I've never seen any site ask to login to any bank account before. And GDAX is owned by bitcoin, so I really don't trust them enough to give them my SSN. I'd upload my ID for Paypal but they also want to login to my paypal. 
Wish they still just had the routing number option. Crazy imo

If I kept it on there wouldn't I face the same issues later anyways? The fees go up, and still would have to log-in to my bank. I think I'm more frustrated at coinbase then at crypto atm, like I wish it was just on another site, or I picked a better site years ago or something lol It wouldn't be such an issue with me to even keep it on there for a while if I could just add my routing number to my bank. This whole thing just makes me annoyed more than anything and even more so not want anything to do with crypto.
I'll have to keep it on till middle of the week anyways, because only way to get it out is to login to bank. Want to make sure I'm able to call my bank if anything happens.

I'm in the US, in Kentucky. 
I wanted to add just my bank information but they ask you to login when you click "add payment method". Which I wouldn't do for any site. They have credit and Debit and wire, but that's only to send coinbase funds, not to send them to your bank it says. Then they have Paypal but they ask for ID and ask me to login to Paypal. I looked online and it said you can pick "Other bank" and just put routing number in or w/e, but they don't have that option from what I see. They must have removed it.
So I thought I'll just send it to another wallet where I could cash out easier but they charge a $30 transaction fee, for my $16.62 lol  
I just find it ridiculous, and I hope someone can help me out here to just cash out the small amount.

GDAX is asking for the last 4 digits of my SSN so decided not to do that. Coinbase asks to much information in my opinion. 
Idk why I can't just link the routing number or send to paypal, instead they want either an ID and to login for everything, my SSN, or to sign into my bank account.

Apparently I can get on gdax, trade the BTC for ETH, then it will just be about $1 transfer fee. Then I can trade the ETH for paypal on reddit lol it's crazy
Edit: nvm gdax is asking for my SSN. sooo on to the next thing

You too, happy holidays!

I'm chill, but I don't want to hold onto the bitcoin. I just want to cash out. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:46:40
I don't really want to hold onto it. I'm not big into cryptocurrency. Just want to cash out. Even if I held onto it, I don't really see why that would matter because later on if I wanted to cash out, it would be the same problems I guess. 
Hope this didn't sound rude, it's text. Just want to cash out.

That's what people are assuming. It could happen, and it might not. I'm not into investing into crypto currency. I'm just not interested in it at all. I'd rather invest it into something else, or put it towards commodities. 
If I was interested I'd probably invest it into another crypto though, since I find the fees a huge turn off.

I'm just going to wait until the middle of the week, put my bank account on there after I change my password, transfer the money, remove my bank, then change the pass again. That way if anything happens I can call my bank right away and they can stop it. 
Seems to be the only way. Sucks they can't just let me add a routing number though. I don't know why they removed that option. 
Even to trade my BTC to ETH takes an ID which I just don't feel comfortable doing, since I don't know the site at all really (signed up years ago), and they already asked me for information that no other site has asked me for before. Even google adsense and Amazon pay doesn't ask for me to login to my bank. But w/e I'll just do it later in the week after the holidays. 
Another question, is how is bitcoin ever going to become a legit currency when transaction fees are so high to transfer the bitcoin? It seems it's only used to make money now, buying in, and waiting for it to go high to cash out. I don't see any normal person actually ever using this to buy stuff from stores or w/e when the transaction fees are so high. Just wondering on this. 
Anyways, thanks!

How am I being stupid? How is me wanting to cash out my own money being stupid? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:02:58
Yeah that might work. I'll look into capital one, thanks! I also emailed coinbase to see if they still have the option for the routing number somewhere and maybe I'm missing it. I'll wait for their response too.

I'm not putting Bitcoin down, I really just like investing in other things and buying commodities. I'm not even putting crypto down, I'm just not interested in it. So I don't see why all the "you're stupid for wanting to get your $15" or you saying "lol,ok". 
Just because Bitcoin did well and is doing well now, doesn't mean it will do well in a week or a month from now, where as buying commodities last your whole life if done right, and investing in other things you find interesting or think will do well can end up having the same outcome as crypto.
