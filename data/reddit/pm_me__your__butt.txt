If no one uses their bitcoins, bitcoin is a pyramid scheme. You gotta use your bitcoins to encourage adoption. Otherwise, without utility, there's no purpose other than a scam making early adopters rich from late adopters buying in with no purpose.

between 1998 and 2016 it's super stable. Keep in mind that in an inflationary society, "stable" means at least a 4% increase per year to maintain the same buying power.
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:54:01
I don't know who wrote that... but if 51% of the hashpower is controlled by someone other than bitcoin core, than that new entity becomes bitcoin. I don't see how that's an attack... That's what DECENTRALIZED currency is, decentralized... 
You're trying to create a bank, not a cryptocurrency.

So who has the channels? Like kraken would be a channel?

Maybe miners are clearing tx pool to make sure difficulty increases by a lot next wednesday, to force the bitcoin miners that are only in bitcoin for profit (and not ideology) to switch to bch. That would mean that after next wednesday, you're going to start seeing 50$ fees.

See the first and second points though. No utility right now...

When BTC starts dropping like crazy, the exchanges shut down. You've seen it happen a few weeks ago.
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:10:15
??? What kind of an answer is that? I'm asking about it here.

low tx period 
Your sample size of n=1 is staggering. Try to do this during periods when a lot of people want to move their money.
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:45:37
What does that mean? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:29:41
Yeah, all altcoins derive their value from bitcons.

Your BTC is safe on a compromized computer if you have one of those little friends.
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:14:53


But bitcoin has no utility. This will never happen. Your 0.0000000090 will have a 0.1 fee... :\
There needs to be a viable utility to bitcoin or else there won't be enough money to keep it afloat in the long term, I believe.
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:30:04


well... yeah?
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:04:52


Nope, can only buy BTC there.

To him, bitcoin is a corrupt version of what used to be bitcoin, and bitcoin cash is what the clean version of bitcoin was. 
Imagine a pc being infected by a virus. He sees bitcoin cash as the restore point.

I think you're behaving like a child. No2x are a bunch of thugs that stopped the majority consensus with their thugish behavior.

@_date: 2017-11-18 21:36:42
From what I understand, 2x had majority signaling. So S2x was bitcoin, s1x was an altcoin after s2x passed. When you go against the majority and the only reason you stop is because you, and a minority of people are vocal about your opinions being more important than everybody else's opinion, you and every no2x owe the entire bitcoin community an apology for usurping consensus and turning it into a teen fight. Your investment would have been protected as part of 2x.

I haven't thought of that. Does gold increase in value over time, or does it retain value? The point of gold is to retain value at a constant, non-fluctuating rate.

If the chinese government decided to do that, there isn't much you can do even if you don't shrug your shoulders. In that eventuality, the best thing to do is to make another coin, I guess?

"If you have 3 orders of magnitude of people. you would need 3 orders of magnitude increase in block size."
Bro if 20 billion people were doing transactions, I'll give my left testicle for 1gb block size. It's a fucking drop in the ocean compared to a global economy. Aint even 20bil ppl on earth.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:46:51
But you would need 2^8= 256x more transactions to clog up the bch chain, no?

With gold it's: Money in = Money out.
It's super stable. People aren't hoping bitcoin stays at 8k, they're hoping the value rises...
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:54:57
Since a few days ago, it wasn't a dip, it was an attack to remove bitcoin completely. It got saved by the fact that it's too slow to process transactions out of bitcoin, as everyone was fleeing out of bitcoin. Now it's a dip because we can see it go back up, but a few days ago, it was a panic here.
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:15:00
Lol, the bottom part shows bitcoin as a shitcoin... -_-

I won't pretend I know what you're talking about, but that's what I think, that he sees the current bitcoin as a virus, and bitcoin cash as the cure.
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:28:08
Actually the two main reasons BTC is protected are:
1. When BTC sees a massive drop and users try to flee, exchanges shut down because of 200k+ unconfirmed transactions. BTC's biggest flaw is its' strength. Users are not actually in control of their money when BTC is crashing.
2. Whenever alt coins start to rise, the exchanges get DDoS'd to prevent that from happening.

Then your friends don't realize that they want a ponzi scheme, and not a new currency.

It's not a box plot, its a candlestick chart. Top is max, bottom is min. the box is difference between opening price and closing price. It doesn't represent volume, just difference in price.
