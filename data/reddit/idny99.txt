Why does everything keep getting hacked!?! This really needs to stop or Bitcoin will really struggle to gain trust from the average person. 
I'm long BTC, and have been involved since 2012 so i'm fully aware of what needs to be done to secure my holdings. However, I'm wary of getting friends and family in BTC because of the increase in hacks/malware and the methods of securing your coins are too much for the basic computer user. I've stopped talking about bitcoin with people who are not involved because they always respond with "didn't X exchange get hacked?". If people keep hearing stories about this how can someone who is not currently involved in btc have the confidence to do so?
I really want Bitcoin to succeed but the frequency of hacks is increasing yet it seems like we are doing little to prevent this. The mainstream services (BitStamp, Coinbase, Huobi) seem to have robust security methods, but there is still **a lot** of money in exchanges that don't. 
Edit: spelling

What I see happening here is Satoshi's account was hacked and offered on some market place. A darknet surfer discovered this, paid the 25BTC which perhaps included the log details for the GMX account. The darknet surfer then posted a message knowing that the BTC community would notice and give time for Satoshi to take suitable action to relocate.

Actual statement for anyone having problems viewing. 
Dear Customers of BTC 24 Ltd.,
As we have already informed you, we were expecting to receive a
decision from Poland in July. This has now happened. So in this
statement we can give you further news.
**The Poland account**
We now have the decision of the Polish Public Prosecutor’s Office,
from which it is apparent that the seizure will not be upheld in relation
to a large proportion of the money involved. But unfortunately this
also means that a part of the money continues to be sequestered.
Our colleagues in Poland continue to be given no access to the files,
with the consequence that we can only make the following comments
on the current situation:
The reason for the seizure of the Polish account was apparently a
suspicion on the part of the Polish Public Prosecutor’s Office that some
users had utilised their accounts for illegal purposes and therefore it
was thought that suspect money had been received into the Polish
account. Bank transfers thought to be connected with phishing attacks
apparently also raised suspicions. The accounts of our client were
suspended on a precautionary basis in order to clarify the position
and to prevent further use of the money from the suspicious
transactions by the customers concerned.
Before payments can now be made from the Polish account, those accounts subject to the
suspicion of illegal use must be first clearly identified.
But unfortunately this will only be possible once the Polish Public Prosecutor’s Office has given
us and our colleagues in Poland access to the files. To protect all profit already earned, it
is critical that our client avoid paying out money to those users who are connected with the
suspicious accounts.
We are also trying to speed up the proceedings in Poland via the German Public Prosecutor’s
**Commerzbank payments**
The payments from the German account at Commerzbank continue apace. Because of the
complex modalities it has not yet been possible to inform all customers for whom a payment
is possible. But it is expected it will be possible to finalise this completely within the next 2
In the process we have reorganised the disbursement procedures in order to speed up the
After conformation from us that a disbursement is now possible, payment can be requested
directly via the account.
For this purpose a new bank account must be set up and the relevant personal data must be
entered in the fields provided.
Our client will arrange the transfer to the bank account specified once the data has been
**Bitcoin payments**
According to information held by our client, over 90% of all payment enquiries have been
processed in the meantime. But since full functionality of our client’s platform still cannot be
activated, all payments—even the repayment of cash balances—must be carried out manually.
This will mean further delays. Our client will do everything possible to keep the waiting time
to a minimum. Customers who are still waiting for payments may send us an email message
with the user name, destination address and number of Bitcoins—we shall forward these enquiries
to our client who will then process the payments.
**Ticket system**
Our client’s ticket system may only be used for enquiries concerning direct problems with the
account. No other tickets can be processed at the moment.
The release of a large proportion of the money in the Polish account is a positive signal and
grounds for hope for an early resolution of the issues. Payments to customers with no connection
to the suspected suspicious activities of individual users may then be made when the
Polish Public Prosecutor’s Office makes it possible to identify the suspicious accounts involved.
As soon as this occurs, we shall make an announcement in a further statement. For this reason
we shall now also stop making announcements of new statements at nearly weekly intervals
- the situation is not now changing on a weekly basis. But we give all customers our
assurance that we shall issue a statement immediately if there are significant new developments.

That's right. Quark's difficulty increased and block reward reduced quickly which was in it's design. I'm not entirely sure why people are getting hostile against it. I started mining from day 2 so it was easy to pickup a lot of coins, I don't think it's as pre-mined as people say.

I started to mine quark during it's first week after noticing it on the Bitcointalk forums. The difficulty was soo low and the block reward high it at first was fairly easy to mint a decent number of coins, which I still hold to date. When it became difficult and the coins stopped coming on I switch back to FTC and forgot about Quark. 
With the recent posts claiming Quark is a scam coin it jogged my memory about the QRK i'm holding. I've read various posts about it being a scam coin but being out the loop for a while I'm not entirely sure where these claims came from. When did this all start?
