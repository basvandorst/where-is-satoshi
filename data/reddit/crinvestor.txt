dollar cost averaging works well! Put yourself on a monthly nibble plan and that way you actually are routing for lower prices as time goes by!

right on! wtg! Now go slowly...enjoy the experience, there's no hurry here. 
See if you can add over time. You actually want price to go down so you get to buy more at cheaper prices which is the best possible position to be in when 'investing'. When she moons down the road (most likely into next halvening) all your little nibbles will pay off handsomely...welcome to the non-nocoiners club...hehe
