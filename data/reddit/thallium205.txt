These machines are integrated to online exchanges which are in effect buying and selling bitcoin on the fly from other people.  This usually thrusts operators into money transmitter licensing in most states from what we're seeing, which is different from currency exchanging.

I don't want to relegate the discussion to pithy platitudes of job creation, the ATM, "freedom", or 'murica.  If I am able to communicate to them that Bitcoin is just a set of rules like any other internet protocol, and what makes it special and what actually separates it from others is the decentralized community powering it, then I will consider the trip a success.  Bitcoin is programmable money of the people which is what makes it special - we, as a community, can implement programs, policies, and procedures that will govern it far better than what any regulatory regime could ever hope to achieve.
@_date: 2014-03-29 17:58:49
Yes it does...
"We currently perform a three step KYC identification process, at our CCEM’s at the BIT Center, Tijuana.
The customer presents a official ID to a trained security officer and registers in a hand written form, with their Name, time of arrival, purpose of visit and signature to enter the premises of the BIT Center, where the CCEM is located.
To use the CCEM, the customer creates a username and sets a pin code.
If the customer wants to make a exchange over 400 USD, the CCEM prompts the user to verify their identity, and follow the onscreen instructions."
@_date: 2014-02-19 08:12:04
This process also only happens once at the kiosk.  Each subsequent visit is just your phone number, pin, and hand. 
Do this:  execute a wire transfer at your bank, you will notice the teller will require you to swipe your card (what you have), provide your PIN (what you know), and check your face against your photo ID (what you are).  These machines have simply replaced what the bank teller was already doing to you.
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:58:51
The state deputizes those who provide financial services.  This includes operating a Robocoin which is why IDs are collected.
Phones, PINs, and palm veins are collected to provide 3-factors of authentication.  There is no fraud department in bitcoin, so combining these three technologies make it nearly impossible to game from a thief's perspective.  It protects the consumer from those who may steal your PIN and Phone and transact on your behalf.  
That being said, before the Robocoin project, I was an advocate in helping users understand the privacy implications of bitcoin and the blockchain.  I developed an open source tool, which was also a good portion of my Masters work in CS, that was able to provably associate many addresses from a single address.  I helped educate those that privacy is a lot more difficult to attain in bitcoin than what was previously thought back in those days.    Many other blockchain applications are using this implementation as a model for ones that I hope will prove to be very useful for the community.

Bringing Bitcoin to the people of the world, by any means necessary so long as it is peaceful, is a worthy goal.
We are simply trying to keep people out of jail while this transition takes place - how is this a bad thing?
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:12:46
Absolutely.  People have a certain expectation of performance when visiting an ATM and having to do anything outside that expectation is seen as a negative thing - which is a tall order when interfacing with cash and bitcoin.
The immediate problems are getting addressed as we speak and will soon be entirely transformed shortly.  Stay tuned!

Multisig accounts are available if you want to manage your own bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-30 09:13:25
Be sure to use Robocoin's API to track latest info and price data:  
@_date: 2014-05-01 21:20:33
You don't have to trust them.  Robocoin has unmanaged multisig accounts you can create and manage your own key in addition to the traditional full reserve account.
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:32:25
Cards and pins have their limitations: they can all be stolen.  The traditional banking system mitigates this risk to them by simply reducing the maximum transaction amount and time at which you can transact with the card. You will be hard pressed to find even a bank ATM dispensing more than $200 or so because who will be liable when a thief withdrawals from your account?
Our product provably verifies that the person who registered is the one at the machine.  This lets us comfortably increase the transaction sizes to much higher limits.  The ones in Texas, for example, have $10,000 limits at the moment - try doing that at your traditional ATM.
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:23:43
I wish I had more time to think about epistemology.  What I can promise you though is that I will be the first to admit when I don't know something - the problem is that you generally need to know a lot about something before you can even recognize when you don't know anything about it at all.

What you describe is what our machine in Vancouver does.  The Bitcoiniacs have disabled the identification feature there (it's a simple checkbox in our dashboard).  Again, check the map on our website to see which machines have it enabled and which ones don't.  We even have an API so you can integrate our machine locations (and live prices!) into your own applications.

@_date: 2014-04-21 22:24:59
There is no "patching" this issue - it is a fundamental of how bitcoin currently works.
@_date: 2014-02-23 06:47:22
We tried that actually!  As some people in these comments astutely pointed out, the Vancouver machine had the palm vein enabled with the ID scanner disabled.  We had to remove this "semi-identified" feature though because palm vein patterns actually start getting pretty inaccurate when scanning across thousands of other patterns.  It's not like CSI unfortunately.
So, an ID makes it where we only have to compare against a single record we pull, making it very reliable.  
Also, having a person stand there and compare your ID to your face is a biometric scan if you think about it - we're just really used to it and don't find it uncomfortable.  It's what some of our competitors are encouraging their operators do like in Boston, but what is the point of an ATM if its not automated?  I'd argue it's not an ATM at all at that point. ;)

@_date: 2014-02-21 15:08:00
Yeah but why do you think its set to only $500 and not $10,000 like the Robocoin?  Answer: because PINS and cards can be stolen and traded and this is how banks mitigate their compliance and operational risk.
@_date: 2014-08-06 03:15:58
Our savings accounts that will be launched after beta are 2 of 2 multi-signature accounts, meaning if the platform gets compromised, no bitcoin could be withdrawn as the depositor holds the other key.  You may have seen that in the teaser video if you look closely. ;)
Additionally, we employ 3 factors of auth to protect customer deposits - again, the only bitcoin company doing this as we get to leverage the palm vein scanner (notice how, even after being logged in, it required an additional scan before the withdraw took place - this is to protect users who may leave the kiosk and forgot to logout).

We need to inspire confidence with the world that we as a community are far more capable of weeding out and correcting bad behavior than any regulatory department could ever hope to achieve.  I am very confident that next generation bitcoin technologies are going to demonstrate that - we just need a little bit more time from them to prove this.  
@_date: 2014-02-23 09:59:25
Not true.  Unlike a face or a fingerprint, your palm vein cannot be easily "lifted" or surreptitiously captured from afar.  It is simply impractical to have one.
@_date: 2014-02-23 06:38:06
I totally agree.  But consider this: how are we to limit you from transacting multiple times with $20 if we have not identified you?

I'm glad you had a good experience at ole' faithful in Vancouver.  The vast majority of those who have used our machines have had positive experiences.  People find so much more joy being negative than positive - an unfortunate reality of this world.
To answer your question: I can't imagine an operator being able to disable the KYC/AML stuff within the USA.  In time, our goal as a company is to demonstrate why these things are actually pretty cool and that their benefits outweigh some of the initial reservations some have.

It is to provably associate the identity you initially registered with for subsequent visits.  Pins and phones can be easily swapped between one another.
For example, even though you give a bank teller your swiped card and PIN, they will still ask to see your photo ID to biometrically authenticate you.  The palm vein is what accomplishes this step.
@_date: 2014-02-23 08:59:37
And that is what is so truly precious about markets - they (people including you and I) make these kinds of decisions.

Bitcoin ATMs bring a very real, physical presence to an otherwise abstract, digital space.  This is why people love them so much - they can actually point their camera's at something and *see* bitcoin.

I hope we can be strong advocates for bitcoin, both as a technology and as a cause, so we take these criticisms to heart and improve upon them.
Communicating the inclusion of a "miner's fee" is fundamentally incompatible in my opinion to bringing this technology to the masses (however we have since added that to the screen).  I always ask myself: "Would my dad have any clue what this means?" :/
I'd say anyone using bitcoin is still an early adopter.  Many of these issues are merely a software update behind.  If anything, this should be indicative of how early stage we as a community still are.
Also, the bitcoin was promptly returned to him as soon as there was a confirmation.  Our operators are all awesome and help consumers through the many obstacles that face them when dealing with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:58:59
This is why first time enrollment takes 5 minutes.  We check to make sure that person in front of the machine is the same person on the photo id.  Once the identity has been associated, the palm vein guarentees nobody else can compromise your account. It still beats out the week long sign up processes through the exchanges and the potentially cancelled or high risk transactions of the brokerages, while also rendering phishing attacks obsolete.

Hey there,
Actually the Robocoin platform is the first company to employ a true proof of reserves system by using a modified version of proof of solvency as proposed by this project:  
We expanded the project to accommodate hd wallets.  Check out our proposed scheme here:   as well as our fork of the project on our Github:  
Depositors can be assured that their bitcoin is fully accounted, that the platform as a whole is maintaining 100% reserves, and that their individual account identities and balances are still anonymized.

The amount of people I have witnessed first hand absolutely dripping with sweat and shaking after completing a bitcoin transaction is a strong indicator that both our process and the overall process of transactions need to get easier.  I suspect ATMs will be the absolute market drivers in innovation when it comes to making things friendlier for the layman.
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:16:23
Yes.  You would send a transaction to the machine with no miners fee with it and get your cash.  Then you send another transaction, redeeming the same outputs, with a very large fee to a new address you control.  Miners will include your transaction, ignoring the one without a fee. Rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2014-02-23 09:05:29
It does print paper wallets!  Unfortunately, the solution you describe is the very definition of money laundering.
@_date: 2014-02-23 05:40:01
Hey guys I'm with Robocoin and would be happy to answer any questions.
Let me preface it by saying that compliance and security are an unfortunate necessity when it comes to bitcoin.  If it were feasible to keep things simple in most first world monetary systems, trust me, our operators would opt to disable the identity collection but they cannot unless they want to go to jail for years. 
With that said, a few facts:
 - Its a palm vein scan, not a palm scan.  It does not collect any fingerprints - in fact, it protects your fingerprints when you place it on the device.  Unlike face pictures and fingerprints, there are no searchable databases of palm vein patterns making it the most anonymous biometric on the market as it takes infrared picture of your hand's veins.
 - Most people get hung up as to why the palm vein is necessary.  Intuitively, it makes sense to think an ID and a PIN are enough, but they actually aren't.  Why?  Because operators need to provably associate that the person who registered is the same person who is currently at the machine.  Just as the bank teller asks to see your ID even after youve already swiped your card and PIN, so too must we collect a biometric to ensure you are the same person and your PIN hasn't been stolen.  How shitty would it be if someone stole your PIN, transacted on your behalf, and did something illegal with that transaction?  It adds another factor of authentication, protecting you and the operator.
 - Finally, these things aren't your typical ATM with small $300 withdraw limits.  It appears they have been given the OK to transact up to $10,000 a day per person in most state jurisdictions.  
Some operators can actually legally operate without enabling the compliance functionality, such as the Vancouver machine.  From the map on our website:  if you click on the two machines, you will see that their identification is disabled while the Austin one is enabled.  When it is disabled, it is by far the easiest device or process in the world to buy and sell bitcoin.  And even when it is enabled, it is still the fastest and easiest *legal* way of transacting government fiat and bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-11 05:16:40
Government regulations absolutely require biometric authentication. What do you think the bank teller is doing when s/he asks you for your photo id before giving you that big cash withdrawal?
@_date: 2014-04-02 16:54:24
That machine was set to $10,000 USD a day.
@_date: 2014-07-31 21:56:23
Well by that reasoning the same applies to publically traded companies with stock options.
I could buy 100% of the stock of a company, but the price will shoot up if I tried...
@_date: 2014-08-06 03:35:10
No, quite the opposite in fact!  We assume exchanges are going to go down these days.  Having operators maintain a float is exactly what we're doing!  That way, if exchanges go down, Robocoins continue to operate.  The connector merely replenishes inventory.  Check out the coindesk article that better explains that workflow here -&gt; 
We open sourced and architected this project it so new and existing exchanges can easily integrate with the world's largest bitcoin ATM network.
@_date: 2014-01-09 00:44:13
If the operator is in a legal jurisdiction that permits anonymous financial transactions (doesn't exist), they can disable that functionality.  Also, a face photo is a more invasive type of biometric than a palm vein scan (no searchable database, cannot secretly collect it like you can with a fingerprint or a face).
@_date: 2014-01-13 15:21:45

Edit: I'm the CTO addressing just the technology portion of the incident/complaint.
This is 100% shameful lie from Wilkinson regarding XP. All Robocoin ATMs run on a hardened Windows 7 instance standardized through a domain over a VPN. We digitally sign our binaries and enforce that it is the only thing that can be executed at run-time and have spent considerable amounts of thought locking down and securing the physical device itself - far better than any normal ATM (let alone bitcoin ATM) on the market today. In fact, our security measures are part of the reason for the transient issues he was experiencing with the hardware peripherals. Do we like using Windows?  Hell no, but to maintain compatibility with legacy banking hardware it is a necessary evil.

Robocoin makes the bitcoin instantly available to you from a purchase through the integrated wallet platform.  When you buy bitcoin, it transfers it to your account through a inner platform transfer from the operator's account that is immediately available for spending - no blockchain confirmations required.  Also selling is now instant too via Quick Deposit -&gt; 
As always, transactions internal to the Robocoin network ( buying, selling, transfer between robocoin wallets ) are instant.

It wouldn't work.   Some here are suggesting placing a down payment into their wallet which is just silly.  Some are suggesting a deposit timer before the credit card is charged which kills the experience and creates support tickets for uber when the inevitable over/under payment of bitcoin is sent to the address, or sent after the credit card is charged. Nobody is suggesting the advantage of recurring payments that credit cards provide.  Bitcoin brings no value to most merchants especially in the case of ridesharing.

It differs from a normal download because incoming transactions must redeem outputs from previous transactions.  See, each block usually contains many transactions (both incoming and outgoing).  Every time an incoming transaction is downloaded, it needs to link it to an existing outgoing transaction that occurred earlier in the chain.  This is why it takes your hard disk drive so long to seek and find it because it could be a long distance away in your hard drive (seek times are super slow!).  Additionally, it differs because it checks each transaction to every private key in your wallet to see if you own it!  Finally, it differs because it must serially download each block in order unlike a torrent, for example, that downloads several different portions of a document at the same time.  Hope this helps.  
@_date: 2012-06-11 04:35:46


Each block has a *single* reference to the block that came before it, hence making a "chain".  However, within each block holds several transactions.  The incoming transactions in a block "redeem" outbound transactions of another block.  These outbound transactions can be in *any* previous block (or even the block itself if it was spent really fast), so even though there is a very fast lookup mechanism, the speed is limited by the slowest thing in your computer, your hard disk drive.  [Here is a picture I put together]( of an example output transaction getting redeemed later on in another block - perhaps this will better help you visualize it!  


That is correct.  Think of it like a virtual ledger, and your client goes through and sees if your name is on it.  This is a very cheap operation and doesn't hinder performance like the redemption of inputs, but I mentioned because you wanted to know how it varied from a download.  


It certainly does, but as of today it is still an [ongoing issue even with the latest client](

You bring up some good questions.
Robocoins support all the world's currencies - Vancouver is just the first location.  Expect to see operators using these machines around the world very soon, including the US.  
The fees are set by the individual operators and I don't have information for you regarding their plans for that - expect them to be competitive with local dealers.
I would imagine one would only have to declare the cash they are holding.  Operators also set the daily transaction limits of their machines to stay compliant.  I believe the Canadians have to stay within $3000 per day per person at the moment.  However, different jurisdictions and different compliance levels set at the machine will warrant larger or smaller amounts.
I hope this helps!

You will only see transactions if you redeemed it or if the person you sent it to has redeemed your payment.  That being said, I believe there is an issue in displaying multiple transactions between 2 owners - right now it may only display one of them.
The coloring and sizing are explained under the Help section:
Node Label
If an owner has been identified to a real world entity such as a bitcointalk.org username, nodes will be tagged with this information under Alias. Otherwise, they will be tagged with a unique owner identifier.
Node Size
The amount of inbound/outbound transactions that have been sent to and from a particular owner will be represented with how large a node is relative to the other nodes in the current graph.
Node Color
Hotter colors will represent recent activity sent from the owner while a cooler color will represent older activity.
Edge Color
Hotter colors will represent recent transactions while cooler colors will represent older ones.
Edge Direction
Following an edge in a clockwise direction will separate inbound vs outbound transactions.
For owners that have multiple names, you can see where the application 'cited its source' under the Aliases section (it's not formatted very well at the moment).
Hope this helps!
EDIT - The distance on the owner graphs means nothing.  On the time-division graphs, they are bound by the layout decisions of the Force Atlas 2 algorithm.

Lamassu also has major consumer protection problems in addition to its financial regulatory issues (many of which are one in the same).  Have you actually operated one in production?

ELI5 - Let's say you own 2 houses: House A in New York and House B in Los Angeles.  House A receives $50 in the mail to its mailing address 6 months ago, and House B receives $100 in the mail yesterday.  
Right now, there is no way to provably determine that you own both these properties.  (And typing the addresses into HouseViewer.com would not return anything). 
However, let's say you needed to spend $125 .  You do not have enough money from House A nor from House B to do so, so you have to go to both properties and remove all $50 from House A and $75 from House B.  To the casual observer, he now knows you own both of the houses, because nobody else can go into them and get their money.
This is the essence of BlockViewer - it looks for people going into several Houses and combining their money from several of their houses.  It takes these and creates a single "Owner" node, that is, a circle that represents all the houses they can be proven to own.  It finally takes these Owners and looks at the behavior of other Owners, making another network on top of it all.
I hope this helps. :)

Lamassu machine has several problems.
1) They also are subject to many of the same regulations as this device, yet they provide no compliance tools whatsoever.  Most 1st world monetary systems will not allow such device in the coming months/year.
2) They are going to be subject to scammers since they do not give customers proof of transaction.  What if I go up to an operator and tell them that the machine just ripped me off for $100 bucks?  Well, since it doesn't print off any sort of proof, operators going to have major headaches separating legit users from scammers.
3) They have an inventory of 200 notes (maybe 400)?  Regardless, operators are going to have massive inventory costs trying to keep them serviced.  
4) They cannot be left unattended.  They say so right on their website - what's the point of a machine if a human operator is required?
5) Despite their claims, they are easy to steal.  If an operator recognizes it, they will need to build in special frames to accommodate such a small devices.  Even then, a pry bar can strip bolts.
6) Lamassu is a hardware company, Robocoin is a software company.  How is Lamassu going to try and support their customers (software updates, new currencies and exchange integrations) without a license agreement?

Robocoin is releasing next month -&gt;  (Which is bidirectional unlike the Lamassu vending machine)

This was merely to demonstrate that a product exists and is going to be at the Bitcoin conference!  A better demonstration video will be recorded there.  :)  You can get a better idea of how it works from our site:

The miners will not include the fee-less transaction in a block while the one with a fee is included in a block.

Confusing volume for revenue seems like a pretty reasonable mistake to me.  They have already corrected it:

Only if you like sending inexact amounts of BTC....

Where are you seeing these 198-205 rates on local bitcoins?
It perfectly converts the CAD &lt;-&gt; USD rate so there is no major issue there.  All I am reading here is just upset traders who don't like how a machine is replacing what they are doing.

I think you are looking for this -&gt;   It can take pictures, scan id's (both barcode and magnetic ones), and even record a fingerprint to limit and monitor activity that all can be configured by owners to help comply with various jurisdictions.

A bitcoin ATM is more of a misnomer, don't you think?  Really they provide a way to convert your money in and out of separate financial systems.  If anything, they are exchange machines, and the many costs of operating one probably warrant a fee.

CTO of Robocoin here.  The palm vein scanner actually *protects* your fingerprints as it only takes an infrared picture of the veins and blood vessels inside of your palm. 
Did you know that a picture of your face is also a biometric?  It is one that is far more invasive, searchable, and easily collected than anything.  
We spent a lot of time balancing privacy and compliance and found the palm vein to satisfy both worlds quite well.  Through more education, I hope the ignorance surrounding the palm vein will be better understood as a superior form of biometric than any other method.

No it doesn't email them the private key.

Hey all - this is John, the CTO of Robocoin, and wanted to pop in on this thread and answer any questions you may have regarding us.  Jordan, our CEO, has also responded here if you want to talk to him:   
The fees are just a standard revenue split between ourselves and the operators, not from the transaction amount.  It's a better deal than standard ATM contracts and a WAY better product - and the demand for bitcoin makes achieving ROI on these things faster than any franchise model in the world right now (less than a month).  Everything else appears to just be pretty standard contract stuff.  Let me know if I can clear up some stuff with you all!
I know everyone loves a good controversy, but honestly, I really don't see one here.

This might shed some light on how it does it.  
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:15:21
1) Push "Sell Bitcoin"
2) Scan your hand.
3) Select your withdraw amount.
4) Collect your ticket and send the bitcoin to the address.
5) Wait for a confirmation.
6) Scan said ticket.
7) ???
8) Profit.

It takes a picture of your hand that is checked to make sure it is valid.  
The sharpie is irrelevant as it also takes an infrared picture of your hand that maps out the unique pattern of the blood vessels / veins in your hand.
