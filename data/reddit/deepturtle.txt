sure. I have to admit that after re-reading your post more closely I think you could hone your message a bit - which is to find a better balance between security and ease of use, which I agree with.
The counter argument to your feedback is that ease of use sometimes goes hand in hand with poor security or poor "robustness". So, the 10 steps are there to protect folks from themselves because Bitcoin has unique risks-of-use, to coin a phrase. (Oops on the coin pun, not intended.)
Achieving both goals is a difficult challenge. Also, Bitcoin is new, or at least the core devs consider it that way (and I agree) and so they have been focusing on making sure the core network protocol is robust.  They have a long term view. Everyone was hoping the online wallet vendors would fill the gap on usability, but so many of them "got hacked" and lost everyone's coins that they only made things far worse. So, here we are.
The software will get there in time. Given recent news, maybe it will be written by the Chinese, lol. Anyway, appreciate your advocacy. Keep it up!

This is the key to how it could work for WU:
1. Sender transfers bitcoins internationally to a recipient, dodging all international regulation.
2. Recpient of bitcoins logs into local WU website and transfers bitcoins to WU address. This is a local transaction, a simple transfer of a good for payment.
3. Recipient goes to WU office and redeems local currency.
4. WU collects fee for local cash transaction and legally dodges all international banking and government regulations.
5. Profit
6. Money laundering charges against the executives.
7. Bankruptcy

That clause did not authorize the U.S. Government to print paper money and force people to accept it.
From Hepburn vs Griswold:
"It is not doubted that the power to establish a standard of value by which all other values may be measured -- or in other words, to determine what shall be lawful money and a legal tender -- is in its nature, and of necessity, a governmental power. It is in all countries exercised by the government. In the United States, so far as it relates to the precious metals, it is vested in Congress by the grant of the power to coin money. But can a power to impart these qualities to notes, or promises to pay money, when offered in discharge of preexisting debts, be derived from the coinage power, or from any other power expressly given?
It is certainly not the same power as the power to coin money. Nor is it in any reasonable or satisfactory sense an appropriate or plainly adapted means to the exercise of that power. Nor is there more reason for saying that it is implied in, or incidental to, the power to regulate the value of coined money of the United States, or of foreign coins. This power of regulation is a power to determine the weight, purity, form, impression, and denomination of the several coins and their relation to each other, and the relations of foreign coins to the monetary unit of the United States."
The interpretation of that clause has never been overruled.
Within a year of that ruling, the President appointed two new Justices to the Supreme Court who then immediately heard Knox vs Lee. Their ruling authorized legal tender laws based on the governments right to self preservation. I don't agree with the ruling and I consider it unconstitutional, but I concede that the Supreme Court has allowed it.

Here is what FinCen says:
"A user is a person that obtains virtual currency to purchase goods or services. An exchanger is a person engaged as a business in the exchange of virtual currency for real currency, funds, or other virtual currency. An administrator is a person engaged as a business in issuing (putting into circulation) a virtual currency, and who has the authority to redeem (to withdraw from circulation) such virtual currency. "
Then later, under decentralized currencies, they acknowledge that there are no administrators, but they add this:
"In addition, a person is an exchanger and a money transmitter if the person accepts such de-centralized convertible virtual currency from one person and transmits it to another person as part of the acceptance and transfer of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency."
Since the definitions in the first paragraph do not apply to miners, it would have to be the second one. And, I have to admit, a reasonable person could interpret the act of mining (which confirms transactions) as accepting virtual currency and transmitting to another person. Others might disagree. It's unfortunate that miners have to live with this uncertainty.
Personally, I don't consider relaying unconfirmed transactions (by just running the bitcoin client) to be a money transmitter function because only miners actually accept something of value (unspent coins) and produce a valid block that "completes" the process of transferring money transfer to someone else. 
With an overly aggressive interpretation (in my opinion), however, FinCen could claim anyone at all participating in the bitcoin network protocol is a money transmitter. And really, if the definitions do not clearly apply, they can always just change the definitions so they do. It's Bitcoin's Sword of Damocles.
@_date: 2013-06-14 20:26:04
The reporting requirements might allow tracking Bitcoin ownership to some extent. Some folks would rather have as much Bitcoin anonymity as possible instead of a regulated and possibly tracked mainstream Bitcoin, even if that means less adoption and a lower price. 
Personally, I think both perspectives are valid, especially since it is too early to assume that regulations can successfully eliminate anonymity.

The same benefit of coins getting more valuable over time can be made for investments and saving that provide returns over the inflation rate, but people continue to spend even though they have those better long term potential returns available.

"Mining" is not defined in the regulations in a way that is helpful for determining their regulatory status. The only reference to "mining" is to include them within the definition of "obtaining" and that word is only used in the preamble to declare their intent to clarify which actions are regulated or not and in the definition of a decentralized currency. 
You have to look to their other definitions, and I think the one I quoted is the only one I would consider relevant to miners. It could also be considered relevant to anyone who relays transactions, but I think that is a stretch. 
I also think you could make an argument that the miners and not transmitting any more than a user sending coins for payment is transmitting, so the regulation is confused. Perhaps. I doubt FinCen will provide further guidance, so I think we have to wait to hear from law enforcement and ultimately the courts to resolve this. My guess is that they will not go after miners at this point because the connection to the USD is less clear than other enforcement targets.

I agree that the behavior surrounding Bitcoin is a big problem. But it is not because I care if people "overspeculate", buy drugs, sell drugs, or launder money, to be honest. I'm a libertarian. These issues are a problem because it raises the risk of drastic action by government.
While I'm pro-Bitcoin, I don't think Bitcoin can be a *currency* until it survives a vicious govt attack and also until the price stabilizes, which may be many years from now. Until then, it's a highly speculative commodity. But I'm not selling for a long time, no matter what (because it's money I can afford to lose).
@_date: 2013-05-28 00:06:51
I read your post. I wouldn't say it is "simple modelling" . You are assuming things which are not true, which makes it actually quite complex to predict what that kind of world would look like. Your mechanism of causing "I" to equal "R" assumes competition is  perfect, which is not true, and no, it is not reasonable to assume it "for analysis". It assumes an unlimited amount of capital to pursue all productive investments, which is not reasonable. Also, for  you have not explain the mechanism that is causing balance sheets to be reduced. You combine both erroneous assumptions by saying companies will never invest (because you assumed away their income which would have countered the hoarding incentive of the deflating balance sheet, which you also assumed).
I also find it dubious that you have assumed both that revenue is not increasing but growth is present in a way that causes a deflating currency. I'm not sure you can have it both ways. You don't get free GDP from population growth. You still have to invest to service that growing population.
That all said, there is a reasonable argument to be made that a currency with a stable numerical amount will have certain "mechanical" issues if growth of "real value" increases forever. The currency unit may need to be adjusted from time to time. Bitcoin can be divided into smaller units in the future, endlessly, if necessary. I wonder whether "real value" can actually increase forever, but even so, there is a easy technical solution available.

Everything I said was correct, if you were trying to correct me. 
The Fed didn't exist when those rulings were issued. At the time, the U.S. Government directly printed Treasury Notes, which were the "greenbacks" of the time period (late 1860s).
The fact that Congress delegated that authority to the Fed fifty years later does not change anything from a legal perspective. They had to have the authority in the first place and I was that arguing that I disagreed with that authority. Maybe they needed to force acceptance of notes temporarily to survive but that was 150 years ago.

It is also worth noting that it would be unreasonable to interpret that as immunizing everything a miner does beyond the creation of units and spending of them.

Any computer used for browsing the internet, especially Windows, **cannot be secured**. Any security expert that says otherwise should find another line of work.
A $200 netbook that is never used for browing can mitigate the vast majority of that risk.
If you did not know this, then I'm sorry for your loss. It's a hard lesson. If you did know this, then you took a risk, and got burned. Them's the breaks. You wanted to save the $200, which is reasonable. It would cost you 20% of your investment. That's a high risk premium (to use the term loosely), but then again, so is doing anything with Bitcoin on a Windows computer that is used for browsing.
@_date: 2013-05-12 23:47:01
I have a variation on this that is slightly less secure but a bit more functional. I have a small computer that runs the full bitcoin client and that is all . It is *never* used for browsing. I also keep it physically disconnected from the internet and stored securely and I only connect it periodically (behind a firewall) in order to update the chain and install security updates. 
In my opinion, running a separate cheap computer periodically is the only reasonable way for the average user to have a somewhat secure full bitcoin client. (Dual boot would be more economical but that is currently not realistic for the average computer user, due to complexity.)
This advice is not appropriate for a large amount of bitcoins. In that case I would probably divide them up, use paper wallets stored in diverse locations, with some way to inform my heirs.

Right. I don't think the issue is with the mining reward. That is subject to income and future capital gains taxes, so that is covered from a regulatory point of view.

Continuing as devil's advocate, I'll argue that the Feds will say that the regulations say "accept" and "transmit" and don't say anything about "control". They could argue that the "value that subsititutes for currency" is broad enough to include transactions, even ones the miner cannot redeem themselves.

The following is my own opinion and should not be relied upon by others.
For tax purposes, in nearly all cases Bitcoins would be treated merely as regular property and would be subject to tax on capital gains.
There are special rules for foreign currency traders to get some special tax breaks (regulation 988) but the rules are complex and bitcoin traders are very unlikely to be eligible. 
There are also special rules that would allow you to avoid taxes if you used a foreign currency in foreign trade in the regular course of business and so forth. Again, you are unlikely to qualify.
Also, there may be special rules for commodity traders, but those refer to commodities traded on regulated exchanges. They don't apply to bitcoin.
Also, bitcoin is definitely NOT a Collectible, which also has special tax rules. The list of Collectibles are clearly defined in the law, specificaly by name, and includes gold, silver, art work, rugs, and a few other things, but does not include bitcoins.
Unless someone can point me to the text of U.S. law that says otherwise, I think Bitcoin is nothing special from a legal point of view. It is property, like beanie babies.
You cannot avoid taxes on Bitcoins gains unless you give them away (which is taxed as immediate income to the recipient - although they could deduct your cost basis if you provide them that).
From a "let's argue the definition of words for no reason" perspective, I think it is a commodity that is too volatile to be used as a currency, but may settle down enough to be a currency when the market cap and popularity is high enough.

No, not exactly. I'm not saying it is the accepting of fees. 
I'm saying that the accepting of transactions and then subsequently relaying them within a properly mined block, one could argue that a miner has both accepted a "decentralized convertible virtual currency" (the transaction) as part of the "part of the acceptance and transfer" (the verification of transactions and construction of a block) and the miner "transmits **it**" (*it* referring to the virtual currency) in the form of the block ("other value that substitutes for currency") to another person (by sending it to peers on the bitcoin network), ultimately reaching the recipient of the bitcoin funds. 
As for the wording "as part of the acceptance and transfer of blah blah blah currency", I don't think the intent was to only restrict this activity to those somehow involving legal currencies. What activity involves transferring virtual currency and accepting some other currency? Yep, it's confusing. 
I just thought it was just trying to capture the definition of the process of transferring virtual currency and just got over-winded with excessive words. I guess it can be interpreted as accepting "real" currency and transmitting  virtual currency. It might be enough for reasonable doubt but hey, I am not a lawyer, just some dude on the internet.

Essentially, this was a micro-task executed internationally and paid for by a small group of individuals around the world who directly benefited from it, with self-determined pricing, no invoicing, and nearly effortless, voluntary payment, totaling over $20 at this point.
Imagine what we could do with bitcoins if we knew what we were doing with this shit.

Every miner should do their own assessment of whether the FinCEN language applies to them, the risk of getting caught, and whether a jury would convict them.
Here is the FinCEN language so miners can decide for themselves:
"A user is a person that obtains virtual currency to purchase goods or services. An exchanger is a person engaged as a business in the exchange of virtual currency for real currency, funds, or other virtual currency. An administrator is a person engaged as a business in issuing (putting into circulation) a virtual currency, and who has the authority to redeem (to withdraw from circulation) such virtual currency. "
Then later, under decentralized currencies, they acknowledge that there are no administrators, but they add this:
"In addition, a person is an exchanger and a money transmitter if the person accepts such de-centralized convertible virtual currency from one person and transmits it to another person as part of the acceptance and transfer of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency."
Since the definitions in the first paragraph do not apply to miners, it would have to be the second one. Would a reasonable person (on a jury) interpret the act of mining (which confirms transactions) as accepting virtual currency and transmitting to another person?
It sounds like you think pool members are exempt because they aren't the specific entity that accepts the transactions and transmits the completed block - the mining pool operator does that. I'm not sure about that legal reasoning. The Feds will argue that the members of the pool are part of a conspiracy and that they are, in fact, an essential part of the "acceptance and transfer" process. 
If the hashing was a truly generic service that miners were selling to anyone, then you might have a strong argument. But, really, the miners joined a Bitcoin mining pool; they didn't sell a hashing service.
