Yea, that's bullshit. Have your money in a bank and try to cash it out, the government tries to come after you. Don't put in there from your paychecks, start to raise flags about being a drug dealer or some shit like that, or at bare minimum it generally makes it impossible to get a good mortgage without raising some flags. 
Meanwhile even if you divest from banks the government works with them to engage in irresponsible fiscal policy that increases the cost of living and redirects capital to a cabal of big players that just find more ways to fuck you over. Legally speaking a deposit in a bank is a loan issued by you to them, and when a bank issues a business a loan they are actually purchasing a security. Now this lone is forced under the coercion of the government harassing you, and they purchase securities in a manner which destabilizes the economy until they get the government to bail them out with your money.

Can you envision issuing an entity a loan and that party readjusting the terms of the loan so you get negative interest. From a legal standpoint, since deposits in a bank are treated as loans, this is \*exactly\* what is happening.

How about they stop allowing ex-convicts to have bank accounts then. All five major banking institutions in the US  disallow anyone with a criminal record (unless they're filthy rich). They've actually been shown to break the law so why should they be allowed to transact like people who haven't?
Oh wait, that would be called racist and bigoted. There is such a disingenuous commitment to this private party therefore it's ok attitude. Are you for banning criminals? Are you for banning actual criminals? If it's not yea to both then you can stop with the feigned moral high ground.
