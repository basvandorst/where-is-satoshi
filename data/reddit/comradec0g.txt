I JUST thought about this as I was reading the post: if they develop some kind of business registry of wallets along with LN, we could, in theory, have a public record of all business financials and that would be insanely lucrative to companies like google. Like, google could potentially steal the job of quickbooks this way.

I mean, if your example size is only America from 1935 to 1965. Then yes. Otherwise, go read a book or something and stop whining about other peoples' educations. I never took an econ class. Found this all out myself by going up the chain, starting with reading the barely tolerable Adam Smith.

Look, I'm the last person to defend capitalism, but that's not why booms and busts happen. :/

It's kind of unsightly to just make up facts to defend your goal, but okay; they still go through rises and falls in their GDP just as any other country might. They just haven't tanked since the US occupation, and were largely unaffected by the great recession the way we in the states have.

"Classical" as in... what? As in "before Keynes"? Considering this process works rather well for just about every other first world country, I'd be hesitant to call it an exception.

That doesn't really answer my question, nor does it explain any point you might have made. No civilization has lasted much longer than a couple hundred years and maintained strictly the same currency, ever.

I mean, you could tell the country of Japan then has been dramatically losing value in their currency for the last 20 years, right? No, actually, that's not the case, with their Debt that's twice their GDP; their economy is stable. So it must not be a rule then.

Consider me interested.

Yeah, except losing money is exactly how Amazon has remained tax free for so long.

I honestly can't imagine that it's poor management. It was a near constant thing, people being pulled off their mundane tasks more or less every day, and thankful for it. It even kept happening after our GM got fired. The dropping-boxes point I experienced first hand was "handed down from corporate". I can't imagine any of this being anything but classified as "R&amp;D" and run as a tax exemption.

Well, as a former Amazon peon, I can tell you there's a lot of big picture stuff they invest in, but they also invest in a TON of gimmicky projects and ideas. Our warehouse was the first to implement (in the region, so I was told) an in house version of the 360Go that's all over the place, we had a bunch of belt changes years ago, experimenting with new materials (maintenance reported they made no tangible difference, and the default was cheaper), like lots and lots of really small, obviously not overly effective purchases. Like, I spent 1, 10 hour day a week for 2 months taking totes of items, dropping them, opening them up, and making notes on damages. I was told it was for a program to test whether or not Amazon could ship products in a box -as is-. Zero surprises, the packages became broken and they bwcame damaged product. Rediculously silly things, anywhere they could max their budget.

Season 2 was all exposition, which is why it was so slow. I don't wanna drop spoilers, but season 2 *needed* to be slow because it *needed* to be dense to relay the info for season 3. And yeah, I'm excited for season 4. Can't wait to see it all come to a headway. :3
@_date: 2018-03-08 08:35:25
Yeah no. It doesn't matter whether they spend the money on expansion, on R&amp;D, pay for dividends of their own stock in buybacks, or even do the unspeakable, pay their employees more, all of it runs against their profit margin, and as long as they can keep it as close to zero as possible, it minimizes their rolled over tax benefit against their previous losses and extends their "virtually zero" profit for as long as possible. Largely Amazon just invests in new gimmicky ideas and reformatting their already existing infrastructure, so it's not like this does anything for the average consumer or the tax payer.

Maybe I'm more salty about how terribly they treat their employees. I was fired for a minor infraction that HR had gone to lengths to protect other people from. I was 13 days from my one year benefits: a piece of Amazon stock and $3k towards school. They strongly insisted that even if I came back, it would all be restarted. They work folks to the point of passing out, blame the workers for doing it to themselves, and keep dodging every single ounce of responsibility. It's smart, but it's unethical.

This. The manager probably thinks it's only used for drug trafficking or something.
