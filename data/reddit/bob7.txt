Not sure if you're serious, so just to be sure, I was kidding.

Don't you ever call it bcash again or I will freak out all over you.

No no, tax cuts are bad do you even reddit?

They're obviously lying. It's an attack on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:25:20
Ah yes, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Store of Value.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:07:35
Standard, as it is the default option.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:19:03
Yeah, it completely destroyed Linux.

You're going to jail son. Uncle Sam will just hold on to those private keys for you.

What we need is market saturation, widespread adoption and then the price to stabilize, wherever that is.

So it sounds like these two Bitcoins have different visions, and I can only see that as a good thing. The more the better. That's what open source is about. If someone has a good idea, incorporate it. I don't think anyone minds a thousand different Linux forks running out there called Linux. It's great. It seems that Bitcoin has not embraced what open source is about. The idea of one destroying the other. It doesn't work like that.

You'd almost think I've offended you by something I said in this thread. Breathe slowly and get a grip.

It's not a scam, and it's hard not to see Bitcoin Cash as being on the "right side" of Bitcoin when I read this subreddit.

Hold both, you'll probably feel better.

As a layperson who can't build a car, can I learn about them and form an opinion before deciding which one to drive? It still wouldn't make me an expert in how cars work. And if I value reliability, I wouldn't expect everyone to get pissed off when they see me driving a Toyota instead of a Honda.

I could explain why it's arguable that Bitcoin Cash is just "Bitcoin" due to forking off the same code base and blockchain, arguably following Satoshi's vision more closely, etc. I'm guessing you know all that and probably just disagree. Really, I just believe in Bitcoin Cash's scaling. It's simple and immediate. I understand it. It seems like what Satoshi intended. I'm no expert, and I kind of don't care which Bitcoin is the "real one". I just like Bitcoin itself, may the best one win. I don't really understand the Core argument for scaling, the 2nd layer stuff. It feels wrong, or at least, unnecessary. But that's okay, they know better than me. But the attacks on Bitcoin Cash are over the top. A lot of people sound delusional. I mean, it's just an inferior Bitcoin that screwed up their scaling so it's doomed right? Plus, if Bitcoin Cash is right, they can't destroy you. You just increase the block size and make them irrelevant.

Lol cracked me up.

Not possible. See post above.
