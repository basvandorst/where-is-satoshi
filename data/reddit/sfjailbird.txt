What the world wants is a payments network. That is the use case that is wildly successful and in heavy demand.
You want to build fantasy technology to free the masses and bring about anarchist utopia (somehow), I respect that a lot. But so far it is only a dream and some theories, based on zero reality. A complete pipe dream. Also, does Amir think Blockstream's backers are aligned with his ideas? If not, are the developers simply fleecing investors, and are you okay with that? Worse, are they asking their developers to build a business model into bitcoin?
Besides, imho, bitcoin as a currency and payments network (not a centralized system on top of it) is crazy revolutionary and *actually achievable*. We're so close! We should work on that.

Loved the first part, hated the second passionately (the far future part). 
I have the same thing with other Stephenson works: Loved Cryptonomicon, hated Snow Crash, Diamond Age and a couple others. I suspect he might actually be two different authors...

Bitcoin is designed around the idea that miners will do what is best for the network, in their own self interest. If that principle doesn't work, then bitcoin today is broken.
At the end of the day, we are playing in someone else's backyard  (the miners who have invested more than anyone else into the network). If you don't like their rules, you will have to go and build a similar or better network to use. It's as simple as that.
