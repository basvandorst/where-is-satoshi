Do you understand why they were shorting it? It’s because the premium had jumped to nearly 100%.  In other words each dollar you invested in GBTC was only backed by $0.50 worth of bitcoin.
At today’s close GBTCs premium was down to about 15%. If bitcoin itself stabilizes, look for GBTC to begin climbing again in the short term because they are still one of the only options to invest in a bitcoin backed stock.

It won’t drop until it’s even with bitcoin. Investors will pay a premium because it’s the only option they have to put some of their 401k and IRA money toward bitcoin. But a 100% premium was a bit nuts.
On that note, the minute some crypto ETFs hit the market GBTC will surely tank.

Nearly everything you own comes with the same price tag as blood diamonds.  It all comes from the suffering (and yes, even deaths) of others.  Jesus man, open your eyes.  You are trying to judge others for what they spend their money on when what you spend your money on causes just as much (if not more) suffering.

Anyone should seriously reconsider a relationship with a person like you who judges others with such absoluteness.
Why do you care so much about how other people spend their money?  How do you spend your money?  
Have you ever bought a computer or an expensive smart phone?  They are going to be worthless in 10 years.  In fact, I'm willing to wager that a $5000 diamond ring will be worth more than a $5000 computer in 10 years.

I hope you and "your girl" don't own any computers, smartphones, televisions, shoes, clothing, plastics, etc made in China or SE Asia. Because if you own any of the aforementioned you must love child labor and horrid/inhumane working conditions.

Yes, that is all true assuming you trust the OP, a redditor of less than one day.

Do you have the blockchain wallet app from the app store (before it was pulled) or are you compiling it yourself?  If you are compiling it yourself you can modify the source and set the new minimum fee to .0001 rather than .0005
In signer.js change lines 415 and 423 to:
self.fee = BigInteger.valueOf(10000);

True, it comes at the expense of thousands of maltreated Chinese factory workers making your bitcoin mining graphics cards.
EDIT:  I love how so many of you think you are taking the high road on the diamond issue, meanwhile you completely ignore the fact that all the conveniences in your life (your computer, your phone, your television, your clothing) are made in sweat shops with utterly horrid working conditions.  Keep down voting me and keep burying your heads in the sand.

Or you could get a developer account and compile an app (I use the blockchain mobile wallet app on my iphone) .. Or you could find a friendly app developer willing to compile and distribute a copy to you using Apple's ad-hoc app distribution.

Horrible working conditions that lead to countless injuries, deaths and long term ailments.  The scale of the problem is off the charts because you, me and everyone we know consumes countless products made in these factories.  There are **a lot** more Chinese, SE Asians and Indians working in shithole factories 70 hours a week to barely keep from starving than there are African diamond miners.
Some quick things to look at:
Africa - 1 million diamond miners - 
China - 260 million migrant factory workers - 
Bangladesh - 400 workers killed when sweatshop collapses - 
Pakistan - 300 workers burned alive trapped inside denim factory - 
I'm not saying the diamond trade isn't a real problem, it is.  But don't try to judge others because they own an item that may have come from the suffering of others.  We ALL own items that come with that price tag.
