This is what I see:
@_date: 2019-07-30 23:41:16
I wanted a device that I can send a transaction on without the need of a computer... I am unable to answer the second question ��
@_date: 2019-07-08 16:03:57
Look up  on Twitter, he has a lot of great resources
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:07:24
I have no idea why it's not going through
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:00:22
It says payment failed...
@_date: 2019-07-14 13:56:00
Ok, I will buy one then. Just send me the lightning adress
@_date: 2019-07-09 06:34:11
I'm using wallet of Satoshi so I don't know why it is doing that
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:04:24
I got yours, send me your address again
@_date: 2019-07-31 14:55:31
@_date: 2019-07-13 22:27:49
What are you even talking about
@_date: 2019-07-02 00:08:22
Now it's gonna be upside down when you use it
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:05:43
I sent another one
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:01:07
Here is mine
@_date: 2019-07-31 00:03:56
Do you know if you are able to send transactions without plugging it into a computer for Coldcard?
@_date: 2019-07-30 23:58:45
I need something that's a single device that doesn't require a computer or phone to send the transaction
@_date: 2019-07-13 22:29:11
I'm the phone, he definitely called, cut the crap mods
@_date: 2019-07-23 22:53:22
I've never heard of that wallet. If you have some extra money consider buying a Trezor wallet, definitely worth the money.
@_date: 2019-07-02 15:28:53
Oh NVM, im just stupid��
@_date: 2019-07-23 23:05:30
Interesting, I will have to look it up
@_date: 2019-07-02 15:29:25
It also has to be over $10,000 for it to work
@_date: 2019-07-13 00:43:10
I'll get one as long as you accept lightning
@_date: 2019-07-09 01:59:07
I'll send some sats
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:10:21
No idea, what wallet are you using?
@_date: 2019-07-30 23:59:46
@_date: 2019-07-13 01:51:08
Just Google it
@_date: 2019-08-18 19:49:10
Oh ok, I live in NorCal
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:11:08
I think the word was smell? Or stell? Or bell? Something along those lines
@_date: 2019-08-17 17:32:52
I also live in California and I thought it was a 11$ minimum wage. Where do you live?
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:40:54
The transaction fees will slowly settle. Also, you're bitpay fees are WAY over what the average is at. I'm addition, the lightning network could also be an option in the future.
@_date: 2019-06-14 02:22:20
I 5 chewed gum
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:09:53
Ok, that sounds great!
@_date: 2019-06-01 02:23:20
Look into brave
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:16:28
That is true, I do have the private keys written down in case it gets shut down.
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:56:04
Won't you already know the private keys because you had to create a wallet for the public key. And if not, how do we find the private address of the public one already on the card?
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:53:19
There will always be people who spend money
@_date: 2019-06-13 22:07:31
I upvoted yours
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:58:52
Wow I'm stupid...
@_date: 2019-06-23 18:27:03
I sent a few hundred bucks to a bitcoin cash address instead of a Bitcoin address. I lost it all and it would be worth a couple thousand now....
@_date: 2019-06-20 19:00:47
That sounds great, so we don't send you the Bitcoin, we buy the card and load it ourselves?
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:59:10
I just realized that I'm stupid
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:59:07
And..... We're back up
@_date: 2019-06-23 20:07:41
Trezor has less coins listed, but I prefer Trezor just because of the interface. I also have a ledger and it's good for the alts that Trezor does not have. If you are only going to store Bitcoin, I would recommend Trezor.
@_date: 2019-12-12 14:59:47
No it's not, my friend bought a wallet off Ebay and ended up getting 300$ of ripple stolen... Much better to buy it directly, but I would wait for the Christmas deals to start showing up before you buy a wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-20 15:20:44
I think that would be great. However, it would have to come from a reliable source because they are extremely easy to steal if you are the seller.
@_date: 2019-05-29 03:20:29
True, I have several family members and friends and most of the time I will mix with them and give them a commission. You do bring up a good point that I should educate people more.
@_date: 2019-05-29 13:37:27
True, I have a Trezor and a ledger. However, I do not have the blockchain downloaded on either of those. Also, it's a lot cheaper to buy a hard drive compared to a Trezor or ledger.
@_date: 2019-05-29 03:19:26
Thanks for the advice, I'm mostly trying to make their storage of the Bitcoin anonymous. In addition, I will sometimes help purchase their Bitcoin in person from someone else in person to make the purchase anonymous. My main goal is to help and educate them to be able to store, send, and transact Bitcoin without the government knowing.
@_date: 2019-05-29 15:02:12
True, but it's more of a backup and simpiler method
@_date: 2019-05-29 13:42:50
Also, what if the Trezor in ledger servers get shut down? You will still have your keys of course but where would you be able to take them? If you have a backup of the blockchain on your hard drive, you can find any computer and unlock your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-29 03:26:00
That is a good point, I should probably not get involved in anything too illegal ��
@_date: 2019-05-29 03:16:52
I started with family, then I branched out to local city facebook groups, and Craiglist...
I don't get a ton of business, but the people who I did help were very satisfied.
@_date: 2019-05-29 22:01:04
What's the payment method
@_date: 2019-05-29 03:09:22
Thanks, I've actually got a lot of business because a lot of people (like my dad) buy Bitcoin from a business perspective but have no idea how to stay anonymous online....
@_date: 2019-05-29 03:43:57
I created a new profile just to talk about Bitcoin stuff... My alt account is more of a spam account. I can understand why this may look like a scam.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:17:51
They had us at the first half, I'm not gonna lie
@_date: 2019-05-29 13:35:33
I am not familiar with wasabi. I do educate people about sending unmixed coins...
@_date: 2019-05-29 04:35:07
Is there something wrong with that? I let them put in their own passwords, but I get them to that point. I never look or touch their passwords...
@_date: 2019-05-29 15:01:25
Yeah, most of the time I let them set all their passwords and keys and I just set them up
