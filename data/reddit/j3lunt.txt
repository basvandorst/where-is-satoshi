Yes I have heard about spoofy. I guess what I am trying to understand doesn't exist because of the manipulation.

My thought is it acts as an intermediary step to get the user acclimated to cryptos, BTC specifically, and then from there they can transfer out to their own wallet - software/hardware.

I leave limit orders on the book because I want to strike at a specific price point. Are you saying that's not a good strategy?

So if both sides look the same, it should be stable?

Be careful with the lanyard. The plastic rod you loop it around broke on me after a month of limited use. 
Almost had a heart attack.

It's one of the watch faces called X-LARGE. Just set the complication to Stocks and add BTCUSD to the Stocks app on your iPhone.

Yup. Still can't wrap my head around it! &gt;_&lt;
Thanks for the link. Very informative. So am I to believe that as long as a key pair is not used for sending or receiving bitcoins, it can be used again theoretically? Or is that probability not even a worry with such a large amount of possibilities of key pairs created?
Large numbers aside, how does the blockchain operate in regards to address creation and destruction? Are wallets just continually created and the hope is that the key pair will never be created again or does the blockchain have the ability to recycle wallets that have never been used?
