Do I look rude if I say you're an idiot?
BTC-E is not an online wallet. The Bitcoins are not sent from your deposit address. When you won the bet, it was returned to one of the BTC-E's internal addresses.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:29:37
I can't understand why they downvoted you LOL
@_date: 2014-03-09 14:15:57
Because it's against Bitcoin's philosophy. If we changed the protocol for every theft, there wouldn't be any difference between Bitcoin and (say) PayPal. 
Moreover, if someone (the dev) had the ability to change the protocol whenever he want, who would stop him from creating more Bitcoins or stealing Bitcoins from other people?
Irreversibility of transactions is one of the most important parts in the Bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:17:17
LOL, he's joking. He can't have 150 million bitcoins, because the total number of Bitcoin that will ever be mined is 21 million.

What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
@_date: 2014-01-25 12:08:59
You say you read enough about Bitcoin but you don't know that there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoins...
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:10:40
I heard someone was planning to make a film about Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:59:42
Me? I didn't have BTCs on GOX. You are the only idiot here.

How many Bitcoin users does it take to change a lightbulb?
7, one changes it, and the other 6 confirm that the lightbulb is legit.

Are these Casascius Coins?
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:58:42
I was wondering the same thing.
@_date: 2014-04-01 17:06:52
What about the time when Bitcoin was $0.01? 
^(Just kidding)
@_date: 2014-02-04 14:55:57
Wow! We have a little genius here! Show me how you can send someone 1 satoshi!
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:09:42
Do you know where that coin comes from?
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:15:37
Hey, we're a bunch of nerds. There are nerds out there who've played the same game on Sid Meier's Civilization **for 10 years**.
I think that even if the Bitcoin crashes to $0.01, we would have enough willpower to maintain the biggest Internet revolution since the internet itself.

Technically, Bitcoin was premined too.

If we could block MtGOX funds, what would be Bitcoin's purpose?
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:09:56
Same here. I don't know who I am anymore.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:11:00
Your statement just doesn't make sense. **THEY** closed the exchange because everyone was panicking. If they wanted to buy Bitcoins at a low price, they shouldn't have closed the transactions.
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:00:56
     


@_date: 2014-03-25 19:35:14
I would add presumptuous.
@_date: 2014-04-01 17:08:34
NXT already does that.
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:19:15
So you just come here and say I'm an idiot for no reason?

Don't trust this software. Do you really think someone would release a trading software **for free**? No.
Look at the website. Seems like if it was made by a 12 y.o. who's trying to learn some HTML.

Hi doge-fag, how's going with your currency for retarded?
@_date: 2014-02-05 19:32:34
Did you put a space after the address?
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:03:11
I tought it was a good idea :(
@_date: 2014-02-04 13:47:55
You are clearly missing the point of currencies like Dogecoin and Fedoracoin.
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:37:32
Yeah let's mess up the whole Bitcoin system because someone wasn't smart enough to secure their savings!
The purpose of Bitcoin is to create a currency which has irreversible and anonymous transactions, exactly like cash. If we make transactions reversible, then we don't need Bitcoin anymore.
@_date: 2014-03-08 11:31:16
But this is actually good news!

Tell me about the intrinsic value of a piece of paper.
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:40:23
This doesn't make sense. When Bitcoin price will rise, we'll have something like 0.008 Bitnotes. It will face the same problem.
Moreover, the site doesn't show **what** are bitnotes. A cryptocurrency? Or just a new way of writing Bitcoins prices?

...or done by Gox who would like to disguise it as done by thieves disguising it as done by Gox trying to disguise it as done by thieves disguising it as done by Gox trying to disguise it as done by thieves disguising it as normal gox transactions.

Sorry I have no Dogecoins.
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:48:57
That's the definitive answer.
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:37:33
Every financial service uses the smallest unit to store/elaborate values. This because float numbers (such as 3.2) are not very precise, and in financial softwares and applications, you need the best precision you can achieve.
MtGOX used satoshis (1 satoshi = 1 * 10^-8 BTC) to store values.

The book is "Mastering Bitcoin" by Andreas M. Antonopoulos (O'Reilly) 978-1-491-95438-6  
If you haven't, I highly recommend reading it if you want a deeper understanding of how the Bitcoin technology works.
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:53:10
Inflation is necessary in a healthy economy. Without inflation, nobody would spend money because it would be worth more after a year.
Exactly what happens with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:29:44
Well, every time the Bitcoin reached a new record price, it crashed hard
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:27:02
That's speculation. A gain for a person is a loss for another one.

I don't know. Probably some millionaire withdrew his money and this has caused a domino effect. This is pure madness.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:43:43
WTF?! You downvote this thread just because he said BTC dropped to 900?! **THAT'S REAL. BITCOIN IS WORTH 900 RIGHT NOW**. Be realistic.
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:29:04
I'm not worried, in fact I don't own Bitcoins, I'm just curious.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:24:42
Bitcoins can't go to 0$, because anything in this world is worth 0$. Everything has a value, even if it is very very small.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:21:07
If dollar disappear, no one will be able to use it to sell BTC :P The people simply will compare BTC to another currency
