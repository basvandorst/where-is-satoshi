Yes I would and did sell a % of gains. It’s worth it. I wouldn’t HODL under all circumstances. Decide a % you want to sell/trade and keep.

Mate I have hardly any myself-I spent most of it online before it was worth $ and then made some cash when it went mental but that’s just luck-still buying stuff online when I can because it’s so cool to buy something with BTC!!! Love it ��

Invest in the stock market if you want to make $. Bitcoin is not about money! It’s about creating a new fiscal system out of govt control where you can be independent of banks. It’s still good for that even at 1$ a BTC

Reading this thread (and so many others) depressed me. We bought bitcoin back in the day to buy and sell stuff without going through banks and paying fiat. It was cool to have digital cash and buy shit online you couldn’t buy with fiat. Silk Road etc was why we bought it-we were part of the decentralised future-buying bitcoin was anarchic-we were cyberpunks! Now it’s just about the fucking money and lambos and bullshit. We made money in December because we invested in something we believed in and got lucky but we still have bitcoin because we believe in s future not controlled by big banks and the man! Fucking grow up and stop worrying about the price in $. It’s about being able to bypass the system and do what we want. Bitcoin is still the future-relax and enjoy the ride ��
