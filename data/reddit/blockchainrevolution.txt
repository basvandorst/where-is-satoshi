Yes but if you're exchanging btc per fiat peer to peer, the exchange itself doesnt have to be centralized, right?  If you want btc and I want fiat, or vice versa, and we can talk to each other, no central control is necessary, correct?
I imagine something like localbitcoins, except the escrow is not dependant on the centralized localbitcoins server but on other (multisignature?) decentralized escrows, and the website through which this is made also being decentralized like OpenBazaar is planning to... 
Forgive my ignorance if Im missing some important detail, I have a basic grasping of how this all works but I can see so much transformative potential, it just feels so right :)

Is there any decentralized alternative to money exchange, like localbitcoins but without the centralized localbitcoins control?  Or is there any being planned? and if not why not? (sorry for all the questions :D , this is all so fascinating! )

Can a miner make a transaction with no transaction fees and confirm his own transaction?

Thank you!
Are there other advantages in using circle.com ? Are they any better than other exchanges?

Hmmm.. 200e limited account with just email verification, and 1000e a month you need to send passport scan. I dont like the idea of trusting someone with my passport details for the 1000e-month limited account. How do I know you keep it safe? Why do you have to ask for that? Its not like big criminals will profit from 1000e a month 'scheme', so you cant argue its for some kind of safety against those people, there's no need to get the average person's personal details and endanger privacy.
