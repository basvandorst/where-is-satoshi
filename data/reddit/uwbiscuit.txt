Once the money is available you actually have much greater control on GDAX through limit orders as opposed to the CoinBase market orders with inflated prices they charge you.
However, it sounds like you are in FOMO.  BTC has been sideways trading (and actually down) the past few days so waiting a day or two probably won't make as big of a deal.  Believe me... I've played the FOMO game and lost before, trying to not have others do that unnecessarily.

I think CoinBase is a good option for you to start.  Open up a CoinBase account and link your bank account.  But DO NOT deposit directly into CoinBase through their main website!!!
Go to  and make your direct deposit from your linked bank account on there.  GDAX is a website that's also owned by CoinBase (same company) but they don't charge you at all for an ACH bank account deposit into your account like CoinBase.com will.  Downside is that you can't deposit on GDAX with a credit card... convenience has it's costs and CoinBase is the only way to deposit with a CC for an instant transfer.
I've already recommended the above to friends and family and it saved them $20-$30 in fees they were going to blindly pay.  Why do that???
Good luck!!! It's a wild ride! HODL

Please tell me you "pulled the trigger".  I love hearing these stories and if you actually did this 2 months ago you'd be sitting pretty now (early 2018).  I've been contemplating a move like this myself with BitCoin coming back down from nearly $20K to a manageable $14,500.
As for loan options Prosper or Lending Club let you get a personal loan no questions asked on how you are using it.  I think you might get better rates with a larger institution or credit union but you'd have to do some shopping.  Cool thing about the P2P lending is you can post the interest rate you want and see who bites at it.  Can't do that with a traditional financial institution.

Regardless, it's much lower in fees than CoinBase.  Which was basically my entire point...
