I have no illusions that this is a novel that I will ever see a penny for. I still intend to write it, probably for many of the same reasons that many people write novel-length fanfiction.

The story's main worldbuilding detail is that in 2050, an event similar to some descriptions of the Singularity happens, and most cities are rebuilt into strange towers, all people therein having disappeared, and odd bits of technology being discovered by the rural survivors here and there. "TVA" has been my catch-all placeholder for advances in internet technologies over the next few decades; I'm figuring that it started as a distributed replacement for centralized Certificate Authorities, and ended up swallowing as much net infrastructure as possible. I'd like to be able to do more with that than play buzzword bingo; for example, would it be feasible to replace today's public-key infrastructure, where a scant few thousand people and groups sign each other's keys, with multiple blockchains with just about every imaginable entity adding a transaction note whenever it has evidence it believes that, say, Email X is the same as Twitter Y?
I'm planning for a significant part of the background to the main plot to be for hidden groups to arrange for a person to be able to pass the Bunker's identity checks, and to get them to that bunker along with certain encryption keys. What I want is to improve the reasons those hidden groups are going to all that trouble. The simple reason is to gain access to the CPUs, to simply increase the computing power they have available; but I'm no longer satisfied with that. I'm hoping that I can come up with some form of blockchain attack which this particular bunker may be able to help with - maybe a blockchain signed with the governmental keys can be used to override and toss out a branched blockchain that's been puttering along without said keys, allowing the particular hidden group that gains control of it to do interesting things to their rivals' computing. But my technobabble-fu is weak, and there may be even better ideas; thus, my post here
