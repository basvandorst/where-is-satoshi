I have multiple bank accounts at Bank of America.  It takes me a couple hours (it goes faster if I call an get someone on the phone).  Just last week, I transferred $5000 over the phone almost instantly.  There are many advantages to BTC, but this one sounds like you need a better bank.

Transfer BTC to CampBX, sell them there, use Dwolla to withdraw from there.

Mainly, payment of interest (like a money market account), as well as some sort of insurance of deposits.  I would be interested in hearing your thoughts as well.

I was able to do it about an hour ago.  Still, as a new feature, there might be a couple of bugs to work out.

Unless the country is printing billions or trillions of Venezualuan currency, other factors are causing the massive inflation (i.e. unemployment, resource shortages, etc).  Bitcoin wouldn't really address these factors.  Still, I like the idea of BCT spreading to Latin America.

Has anyone else used Ripple to buy BTC?  I've done it once or twice, and it's gone really smoothly.  It seems like a good method of buying and selling peer to peer, without dealing with obnoxious exchanges.

All around and (and a lot of other places), I see a lot of posts of people trying to pump the currency [(Example)](  Is there some sore of campaign to pump the currency right now?  
@_date: 2013-06-11 06:29:42
I believe it means that you use the ripple client to send currency to anyone.  It's super easy though, and you are able to send any currency through the network.  The recipient would then use the Bitstamp gateway to get received currency into their account.

Shouldn't people celebrate the taxation of bitcoins?  Doesn't that mean governments see it as a legal, legitimate (and therefore taxable) source of commerce?
@_date: 2013-06-02 17:05:31
That's a pretty wide net you're casting.
@_date: 2013-06-01 16:11:14
I'm getting kind of tired of these posts (We need to get XXX to accept Bitcoins).  Typically someone will post a company they like, and then come up with some reasons why getting them to accept bitcoins is the only logical choice.  There's no special connection between Bitcoins and solar panels or electric cars.  The company is just trendy right now, and you want to grab onto those coattails.

campbx is not on the list.  My trading plans are safe.
@_date: 2013-06-14 23:02:10
Is there a website with information on the event?

Sell over a periot of time (I.E. 1/10 over 10 days), to average out your selling price
@_date: 2013-04-30 21:29:05
And when you make gains?  Otherwise you give bitcoins a bad name, and perpetuate the stereotype that its a sleazy currency.

I've had my credit card number stolen 3 times.  In each case, the company overnighted a new card to me, and I had a working account less than 24 hours after the incident occurred.  It sounds like the wife could have done more in this situation.  
@_date: 2013-06-01 16:28:29
I think you summarized it pretty well.  It could lead to petitioning/contacting the company/other actions to spread bitcoins.  The Dropbox voting campaign was an effective example of this.  However, there is often no follow up once these posts are made.  People feel like they "raised awareness", and think that is all that is required to spread bitcoins.  It just seems really ineffectual overall.

Everyone on reddit has a PhD and an IQ of 150, they're just not that motivated. /sarcasm

What about a service that works like credit cards, and doesn't release the money for 30 days or so in case of disputes (more of less what credit cards do).  I imagine merchants would be more inclined to accept a new system if it worked in a fashion similar to their current uses.
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:58:46
Very true.  Do you have a theory as to what service would be most in demand/desired first?
@_date: 2013-06-13 14:41:46
You could replace the dollar with a picture of a bitcoin, and have the meme make just as much sense.

Not always.  To quote the [wikipedia page](
"In economics, inflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.  When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services. Consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money – a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within the economy."
While printing money is almost always the cause of very high inflation (think Zimbabwe or post WWI Germany), there are multiple other factors that can affect the purchasing power of money.  It is hard to tell since the article doesn't offer possible explanations.
To quote the article:
"The index that measures shortages -- the scarcity index -- came out at 20.5% for the month of May, meaning 1 out of every 5 goods is not available. "  Whatever is causing these mass scarcities also likely has a play in inflation.
There are also multiple factors that have increased Venezuelan economic uncertainty since Hugo Chavez' death.  Domestic political uncertainty has made it harder for the country to borrow money.  This has led to higher interest rates, spending of much of the countries foreign reserves, and a downgrade of the countries credit rating.  All these could play a factor in the current inflation (I don't know, as I am not an expert on the matter), and the problem is not as simple as just "increase in the money supply."

Exactly.  It was targeted at foreign investors storing their money in a tax shelter.  Though he does bring up a good point though.  A lot of people were probably turned to bitcoins due to a lack of trust in banks, making a lot of customer resistance to a banking service.

Are you just a fan of Joe Rogan?  Why is he the best candidate to be Bitcoin's spokesperson.
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:34:55
I saw those guys.  It sounds more like an online wallet and any real banking services.  Still interesting that they sell themselves as a bank though.
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:42:34
Are there bitcoin-based crowd-funding sites?  This seems like a natural progression as well.
@_date: 2013-06-01 21:41:40
Because I feel it weakens r/bitcoin.  I want to read about developments in the bitcoin community, not what companies people like and try to relate them to bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:45:35
Any prediction as to who this retailer would be?
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:32:12
It's also impossible to get your money back if the merchant is sleazy/screws you over.  Not that credit cards are perfect, but it is possible to deal with fraudulent charges.   
@_date: 2013-07-02 17:35:27
I don't quite get it.  People bitch about how terrible the exchanges are.  Then something comes along that is essentially a decentralized P2P exchange, and adds liquidity to the market, and people shit all over it.
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:18:53
Agreed. I'm more interested in how much bitcoins can replace credit cards and other payment methods. As cool as bitcoin tie clips are, they don't represent a major part of the economy. 
@_date: 2013-06-01 20:10:20
Or a high schooler trolling.

@_date: 2013-07-02 16:16:13
I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not, but you're kind of comparing apples and postage stamps here.  XRP will never be an amazing cryptocurrency, but the Ripple network is a great decentralized way of exchanging things and making transactions.
@_date: 2013-06-09 06:13:48
I think a lot of people have trouble understanding it.  In all fairness, the ideas of trust and IOUs and ledgers is a lot to wrap your head around, especially as a new system.  I think a good analogy would be the people who don't understand how bitcoin works, and therefore claim it is only used for drugs, crime, and porn.
