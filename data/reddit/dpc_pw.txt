Of course, they are not. That's absurd. Asymmetric information, agency problem, etc.
You can't "price in systemic risk" in the first place. If the world is going to end up tomorrow, what difference does it make if GOOG is worth $1 or $10000?


There's no "right". There's just "power". The government has a power (we like it or not) to enforce rules. And so it does. If they stupid or malicious, we're in trouble.


Except the management of the publicly traded company in the current real world that we live in operates under more or less explicit mandate of being a good agent of the shareholders.
And yet the system is created to encourage bad agency for selfish reasons **on a massive scale**, that endangers the stability of the whole system.
And please don't respond with yet another idealistic libertarian "you don't have a right, blablaba, free will, whatever" crap. I don't care. I'm talking about practical consequences, and you're arguments are philosophical and moralistic. 
Shit is going to blow up, global trade might stop, people might be desperate, wars might break out, civilization might collapse. In such case, when you're hiding in the basement from some hungry thugs, I hope "everything was priced in, and you have no right to tell me what to do" still seems like totally worth it. :D

We could argue the whole day that "it's not a crime" and "it's free choice" and "everyone knows everything" (hey, I'm a post-libertarian myself, so I know all about it), but it doesn't matter. What matters is the end result.
Stock buyback creates bad incentives and collectively create a systemic risk. Stock buyback allows company management borrowing money, painting a rosy picture of everything, paying themselves bonuses for good (short/medium-term results/stock price), and ignoring long-term consequences (no one is going to take their bonuses back when "confidence" disappears). It encourages everyone in the management to not think too much, ignore the risk and collect their bonuses. And it encourages the public, to not think too much and keep enjoying price going up. If the law encourages (pays money) for fraudulent behavior, guess what is going to happen.
Read the books of Nassim Taleb for a description of how things like that apply to everything in our lives, and how ignoring them will keep blowing up the world.

Just move the money with some email address in the transaction message or something. If you were able to guess it, someone less nice than you will be able too.

AFAIK Bisq has way too high fees, and thus way too small userbase and liquidity. Which makes it usable if you really want to pay for that additional privacy.
@_date: 2018-06-21 22:54:18
You want bisq to pay you? I don't get it. :D

Really? So what should I expect if I eg. wanted to buy $1000 worth of BTC?
Also - last time I checked the number of trade partners in US was considerably lower than in eg. Europe. Probably because of shitty banking infrastructure here.

is basically "in order: pay your high-interest debt, prepare emeregency fund, max out 401k, max out IRA, invest in cheap index ETF, do not think too much".
And it's OK. No need to change them.

You can set up your own indexer that dumps data to postgres db, and then you can ask any queries you like. :) E.g. 
But I guess you're asking about publically available explorer. :D

Shameless plug. I was working on something similar. In Rust, using rpc interface, dumping data to psql.

True. It took a while for everyone got it. My point is - it isn't only about Bitcoin. Bitcoin is just one protocol, not the whole space. The Internet grew but it took a while before the competition was won by specific technologies, and value-added was formed in different parts of the space. That's something that blind Bitcoin fanboys don't want to hear. Multiplying the price by the growth of users sounds much better. :D
@_date: 2017-04-21 16:16:20
This is naive. The Internet grew, everyone knew it will. The question was how, and which companies, and which technologies in the space will make the most money. Similarily cryptofin is going to grow, that's for sure. But is it going to be based on Bitcoin? Maybe. But if it was that obvious the price of BTC would already be 100x higher.

Some ideas :
I would sacrifice the accuracy for looks: there shouldn't be anything too fast, even if it means it will get to its position too slow.
Nothing should disappear. Canceled order/units should be running away in panic.
I would make all the units meet closer to the center. This way the explosions and canceling out orders can be closer to each other so it looks like they really run into each other.

I'm guessing: an instant and free wire transfer in a country where a banking system doesn't totally suck like in US.

Thanks. I've found some more material online, and I'm making some progress. I have subscribed to this subreddit now, and will ask there if I get stuck again.

Bitcoin could introduce a sidechain as a soft fork, that would be invisible to old nodes, but new nodes would enforce and maintain a completely new chain with ability to move between the chains back and forth. I actually think, this is a best upgrade path for Bitcoin. If we ever feel like changing the technical details a lot we could phase out the old chain this way. 
If anyone is aware of previous discussion about it, I would be interested to read it.

They are a bounty for someone to tell us that quantum computers are powerful enough, and we need to switch algos. Race on.

That's good to know that you can't be sued for developing software, but for operating it - that's a different story. A custody wallet is by definition a money transmitter, IMO - even if my wallet software were to be used for fraction of cents kind of things, no?
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:16:06
I don't think so. Centralized ledger would not have the same level of robustness, reliability and "trustlessness", which are bussiness and technological strong points of Bitcoin. Circle might not care much about Bitcoin libertarian vibe, but their strong practical business approach does not necessary collide with Bitcoin goals.

AFAIK Monetas is built on top of OpenTranscations.
