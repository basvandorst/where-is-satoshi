Raising the maximum block size will make the blockchain unwieldy. There's enough junk going on there already.
@_date: 2015-12-30 14:32:24
Transaction volume is high because transactions are so cheap. If we hit the current cap, then the cost of having a transaction incorporated into the blockchain soon will rise. This cost will curb blockchain spammers and dustmen. I've got no problem with that. It's people that make miniscule transactions that will be affected the most. They have the least to lose by taking their trash off-chain.

Thanks, guys. And thanks for the tips. What I'd like, though, is to hide the initial message about the tip. I.e., is there a way to conceal all posts that contain "@_date: 2014-11-03 06:53:31
For what could you redeem these?
@_date: 2014-11-03 13:18:34
You're right. Tipping btc out of the blue is asking something of the recipient. (I.e., the time that it takes to read the instructions for collecting tips, make an account and maybe set up a wallet.) If that all takes 30 min and the tip is only 30c, then the tipper is insultingly implying that the marginal utility of the recipient's time is less than $1/h. I wouldn't tip less than $10 using the bot. (If a receiving address is provided, then it's different, and it doesn't matter much how small the tip is then.)

Can we view your live exchange rate for AUD to USD and vice versa?
@_date: 2014-01-26 05:37:10
I hope that you don't feel that I'm trying to split hairs with you. Secure isn't a good word to use in this context either. If you store bitcoins well, they are very secure. No matter what happens to the exchange rate, 10 bitcoins will still be worth 10 bitcoins. Maybe, instead of "not very solvent" you would more accurately say "subject to exchange rate volatility".
I understand that you see bitcoin primarily as a commodity (i.e., a store of value) albeit with substantial exchange rate volatility. This is a perception that, for now, I share. There are transaction costs that are currently limiting bitcoin's usefulness as a currency (i.e., a unit of value and a medium of exchange). The largest of these is the desire of suppliers to be paid their national currency. As it goes now, you share the spread on buying and selling bitcoins with the supplier. The spread can exceed 5%.
Veering a little from your comment, I got to thinking: If the spread drops below 1.5% then perhaps the role of bitcoin as a currency will rapidly expand. And later, suppliers may not exchange much of their bitcoin income for their national currency if, in turn, their suppliers will accept bitcoins. The spread becomes a much smaller problem then! To get to that point, I think that we need friction between bitcoin and national currencies to drop dramatically.
@_date: 2014-03-15 12:16:22

@_date: 2014-10-18 22:04:03

I hope that he doesn't import the key as they tip will be accidentally forfeited to me. I guess this is a good time to remind people to sweep the contents of private keys into your wallet whenever the security of those private keys is uncertain.
@_date: 2014-03-27 12:02:02
The stats that you linked to were interesting to read, btw. I see where you're coming from: There is a big overlap between bitcoin and the US right now so regulatory changes stateside affect the whole ecosystem (Austrians and Australians, etc.)
@_date: 2014-11-26 23:08:48
I will manually cause the offer to expire after one week by using the private key to move the bitcoin back to my own wallet, if the uploader hasn't claimed tip by then.
I haven't tried nLockTime controls. Though I have considered building a script that would, after a set period, reclaim tips from private keys that remain unspent.

This is interesting to see. When I was selling BTC through LBC, many of my clients were starting out. I used to maintain my holdings by making trades online. And then when I cashed out some large amounts, I also did it online. If the volume of trades on LBC somewhat correlates with new entrants to the bitcoin market, then this graph indicates that a lot of people have been testing bitcoin for themselves recently. It's great to see.

A competitor has been identified which, by its decentralized nature, is immune to much of the conventional regulatory burden. It is a burden that Mastercard shoulders.

Send a reminder then. I have a mobile phone plan and pay for it every month and the arrangement works just fine. If you want, you can pay 12 months in advance using a push payment method. I don't see what the big challenge is. I avoid pull payments (i.e., recurring payments) because I hate the feeling of someone having their hand in my wallet.
@_date: 2015-09-08 08:29:02
I just checked on Living Room of Satoshi and you're right! You can transfer money into any Australia bank account by sending bitcoin to Living Room of Satoshi. That's cool to see.

He's not a kid. He's a young man. How is it that men and women in their early twenties are so frequently referred to as kids? But then, perhaps you couldn't help slipping a little passive aggressive element in either?

I agree Matt Odell's sentiment but wish that he had expressed it without using the term "killer app".

Btcmarkets.net is my favorite. I used to use coinjar and they worked smoothly too.

Cool to see! To be consistent, shouldn't the bitcoin square show that one Aussie dollar fetches 0.317 mbtc? And the AUD fell 2.5% against bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-13 05:56:58
It's not easy for me to see how that could turn out badly. Will you please elaborate?
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:35:57
Forks are valid challenges. Their defeat will build stronger trust in bitcoin.

Right on. Let banks decline like book stores, newsagents, travel agents, postal services, departments stores and other outmoded business models. This distributed electronic ledger is, like the internet before it, going to shake up our economy in a big way. Banks will not be immune to this and, frankly, I am looking forward to them having a smaller role in our society.

Thanks for the advice. I would prefer to buy directly from a vendor and cut out the middlemen (e.g., Amazon and Gyft). Is that possible yet?
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:02:39
It's kind-of a relief, actually. Some cool heads have attenuated the rally. Perhaps a sharp drop has now been averted and a prolonged and moderate phase of growth will resume.

There doesn't appear to be an easy way to just withdraw my cash deposit from coinjar.io. Their stated waiting time has shortened now (to 24 hours) so I proceeded with my transaction request.
@_date: 2013-11-05 22:19:54
Yes, I would like to use localbitcoins too. I have posted buy and sell trades with narrow margins (most competitive cash option in my area) but I haven't had a response yet.

It has made me more cautious. I have, until now, been quite happy with the service from coinjar. I'll post again when the funds show up. (For comparison, I made a transfer of a similar amount to btcmarkets.net this morning and it showed up on their website this evening.)
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:06:18
That is pretty cool. I've watched the video from the SnapCard website a couple of times now. Can I use SnapCard on any website? Do I provide SnapCard with the private key to an address that has some bitcoin in it?
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:23:43
Is that a problem? Bitcoin is a good store of value.
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:08:12
Yep, exactly. As soon as practical, I take coins from online storage and tuck them into my bitcoin-qt wallet or onto paper. I figured that it would be too convenient for online wallet operators to just indicate that your funds are all there while the coins may not be. For instance, they could be cashed out while the operator is hoping to buy back in at a lower price and thereby score a few extra coins. Following a period of solid growth in the exchange rate, this could cause problems.

I agree, P4L. I will, for now, use bitcoin almost exclusively as a store of value. It beats storing money in the bank! (Interest there didn't make up for the erosive forces of tax and inflation.)
When merchants start offering groceries, petrol, motorcycle parts, brewing supplies, chicken schnitzels and craft beer on tap to me I will be excited to exploit bitcoin as a medium of exchange in addition to a store of value.
@_date: 2013-10-20 06:16:34
Coinjar is pretty good. Though did you know that the daily sell limit (for the whole website) is set at just $20,000? That may, at times, make cashing out any significant amount challenging.
The buy and sell rate can be confusing. Yes, you are charged 2.0% commission to buy bitoin and 1.1% commission to sell. However, the spread is also built in to the (different) buy and sell prices. The spread is actually about 5%. (I.e., if you spend $100 on btc and then cash them in immediately, you will be credited with $95. Of course, this assumes that the $20,000 daily site limit has not been reached.)

"Transactions take 50 minutes to process."
Adrianne Jeffries (the author of the article) should bone up on her topic. Usually, broadcast transactions are visible on the network in less than a minute. I guess that she read somewhere that six confirmations are required for certainty and that these usually take about 50 minutes to roll in. That level of certainty is excessive for all but the largest transactions. For everyday transactions, zero confirmations (i.e., broadcast to network only) is sufficient and it is very fast.

I made a bank transfer on Monday afternoon and I am still waiting to see it turn up in my coinjar.io account today. It's been two days; I thought that this would have been sorted out by now. If there are delays due to high volumes, then perhaps we can be warned about this before we make the transfer.
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:43:43
I am pretty new to localbitcoins too. I have made a couple of sales ($1000 each) and it was really easy. I work on a university campus and just meet at a nearby cafe at lunchtime. I only allow people with verified telephone numbers to initiate a trade. Since I made that change, I haven't been contacted by any scammers. The people that I have met with were also pretty new to bitcoin and really excited. I think that you're right to be firm about when and where you will meet. I wish that you'd had a better experience. Damn scammers.
