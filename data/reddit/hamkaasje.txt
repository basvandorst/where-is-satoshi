Could anyone explain the business model behind a, supposedly free, Bitcoin ATM? Like how is the company behind issueing the ATM profiting from this deal?

For everyone that's invested in anything except Bitcoin, look at the historical chart, usually, a huge spike happens right after Bitcoin corrects from a bull run.

Coinbase has regular USD and EUR pairing so you can exit that way.

There is actually. If Coinbase simply cannot process the number of sell orders at one given time, it will crash. Think about it as a tube, if you get enough 'water' through this tube it is likely to burst, causing a crash.
