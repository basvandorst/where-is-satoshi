You should try to implement segwit in your wallets.
Or better yet, if you are using a third party as a payment processor, you should pressure them to step it up and implement segwit themselves.

Ohai there
I think you need to take a step back and realise that Bitcoin development or code does not reside, live or gets influenved by a subreddit
When you realise that Bitcoin is developed in other places like github, when you realise that Bitcoin development discussion takes place in other channels, then you'll be on a path to freedom
Repeating the 2015 propaganda is getting you nowhere, apart from looking kind of funny
Reddit, and specifically r/Bitcoin is a small forum in regards to the wider Bitcoin ecosystem
All that "censorship" talk is a dogwhistle to likeminded conspiratard folks.

Seriously, whoever talks about "unacceptable" fees needs to shake his head and understand one simple fact:
Fees are expressed in Satoshi per byte.
Fees will be rising because the value of fiat against btc is falling
It is not the fees that are rising, they are the same every freaking day
If you want low value fees, bitcoin price must come down, there is no way around it
This is why SW and other solutions are more important than other more simplistic approaches
It is bitcoin becoming more expensive, so one satoshi today costs more than one satoshi last month.
And now that bcash has some traffic, they also have risen value in fees.
Educate yourselves about how tbe system works people, stop parroting nonsense
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:30:55

I'm not missing anything.
It is you who does not understand that we have hundreds of spam posts like yours here daily, crying over a non-issue, trying to create panic.
Bitcoin does not care about what you think it should be, or how you think it should work.
Bitcoin is math, stone cold math. It is extremely useful and priceless because of its characteristics, a set of characteristics that no other asset, digital or tangible has:
It is a permissionless, decentralized, borderless, immutable, censorship-free, open source, free(as in free speech, the important "free") ledger of transactions.
Those are the reasons bitcoin is valuable. 
And those cannot and should not be compromised over a non issue like "cheap tx" which is a strawman to begin with. 
"Cheap tx" cannot happen when you are priced in the tens of thousands but none of you rbtc trolls actually mention that either
It is already used by a multitude of people, companies, corporations, retailers and banks. Its adoption is bigger every day.
It does not care of your religius beliefs
It does not care of your political beliefs
It does not care of your sexual beliefs

It is not backed, it is artificially enforced on the populace.
As I said, stick to alex jones videos
Bitcoin is a decentralized distributed open source permissionless free uncensorable immutable ledger of transactions
It is backed by actual math, and is actually priceless, as it allows for the ability to transact beyond borders with anyone, without a .gov permission needed.
Try to transact with fiat when .gov does not want you to, and tell me how it went

Using the bitcoin private keys on a compatible blockchain without adequate protective mechanisms deployed on it, would also expose/endanger the keys on the bitcoin chain.
If anyone tracks your transactions ( a .gov turning Coinbase's arm, an exchange hack exposing customer info, a lucky script kiddie on an unsecured wifi spot ) you could be in for bad surprises in the future

Missing on possible future forks, because you might need to use the private keys on another blockchain, to claim coins.

Bitcoin transactions clear in 10 minutes, while VISA will accept chargebacks even 12 months after the transaction has been made.
ACH transactions clear 12-18 months later
Bitcoin is free to accept by the vendor, tx fees are paid by the payee and are counted in pennies
Fees in Bitcoin are an order of magnitude less than Credit Card fees, vendors are charged for the use of POS monthly a percentage + a given amount. Plus, Credit cards cost too much for consumers also in monthly subscription fees, handling fees, and soon negative interest rates
Credit Card information create an avenue for attack in businesses that also have to keep that data safe and face consequences if they lose/mishandle those
Discounts are up to the vendor and in my opinion 15% is a profit killer, but I guess the commenter who.proposed it wanted to give an example

@_date: 2018-10-20 00:44:55
well, for a start, I'm not the original poster you replied to, I just disagreed and expanded.
Second, let me say that I understand that some users do not mind placing trust in a third party, be it a hardware manufacturer for a product that holds private keys, or a software developer for a piece of software that allows for the same thing. As long as you understand the different usecases of trusting a third party vs not trusting it, all is fine.
By "nope" I mean that in your case, you trust both the hardware manufacurer **and** the node that feeds blocks to your wallet.
Now, if you just store a trivial amount in cold storage, and the hardware vendor is reputable, maybe you are safe. But if you need to use your wallet and transact more than a few times a month, self-verification becomes a necessity 
Plus, as I said, some solutions provide nodes with some fees income
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:28:37
yeah, reddit does that to people

For a "weird" reason, bcash shills like ver/faketoshi associates, their employees and people who receive money from them, believe that if a company (Blockstream) releases open source solutions is evil, but if a company (nChain) patents an open source work, scams its way in the market, and threatens with lawsuits its critics, while delivering nothing, then they are ok and "great companies with skin in the game, who care about the coin"

i'm under the opinion that the cost of transactions is paid in btc, and it should be expressed in btc, not in fiat currencies, for various reasons. One of them is the following:
expressing tx fees in USD is misleading. 
for the past eight years btc has been rising in value against the USD. This, among other things, makes it look like the cost of transactions is higher and rising, but in my opinion this is a false perspective.
a transaction with a fee of 100 satoshi per byte in 2009, 2013 and today is a transaction that costs 100 satoshi per  byte. 
But in USD those 100 satoshi per byte have a completely different, and rising, cost.
I find the source code and teh software relevant to the cost of transactions (up to a point of course, as there are other forces in the market too) because they desrcibe the formula that governs the way fees are calculated and enforced on the transactions. 
I agreed with the poster above me, sarcastically though, because the fee dynamics are actually complex, and a stable fee market is a bit far away, in my opinion. Especially if we keep reading tx fees in fiat.

bch is no more of a threat than every other altcoin out there.
it is attack though, make no mistake about it
many coins forked the bitcoin code and tweaked parameters. Not all of them tried to capitalise on the bitcoin name, logo or tx history
i'm sure it will find its niche though

i did actually, you probably did not understand my reply, or you did not like it.
laws mean nothing to bitcoin, they cannot be enforced upon it.
has any human being, anywhere in the realm of human history, stopped transacting in a currency because someone else made an illegal act with said currency?
no, never. 
if people stopped transacting in dirty currencies we would be making new currencies every day.
currencies are tools, they dont care what they are being used for
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:13:01
of course it does
people need to understand that 50 sat per byte will always be 50 sat per byte
it does not matter if we are at 200usd per bitcoin or 20k per coin. 
it is satoshi per byte and it has nothing to do with the perceived value being transacted but the total inputs/outputs

Welcome! I have also been delegated a spamming troll there!
The straw that broke the camel's back and got me a permaban in my case was allegedly this:  and the reason was "spam" but in the last day there, their most prominent marketing account u/Egon_1 was pinging u/BitcoinXio to ban me. 
Since it is rumoured that Egon might actually be one of rogers socks I was promptly silenced.
I had made a habit of shooting down their paid shills like egon, jessquit and offcourse their mods, especially in advertisement posts about businesses and ICOs that Roger runs or invests in.
I was pushing Btcpay in Bitpay shill threads, or bisq in their local exchange threads
 Plus engaging in many posts and reminding people that the sub is owned and controlled by St Bitts LLC with employees as moderators and publicly known marketing agents posing as posters
The truth is three or four days ago I gave them lol
The cancer in rbtc is real.
To be fair I have also receive a six month ban here for making a vile comment about someones life, but I did not go around rbtc crying because it was an actual deserved ban for the thing I said

Now Faketoshi lost and has to cough up 50% of what he claims he mined along with Kleiman

Bitcoin is an open source, borderless, censorship-free, decentralized, immutable ledger of transactions.

Your coins are not lost and version 0.5.18 is not obsolete. From what i understand it is simply a low fee issue.
Just hang in there until either the tx gets picked up or is cancelled. Keep in mind this can take up to 72 hrs for that to happen.
Considering you still have your wallet files, passwords etc, just give it a higher fee and you'll be ok.

Some aspects of an organised society are not meant to be privatised.

They are here to be enjoyed by all the people living in that sociey, regardless of their ability to pay taxes, or even have an income in the first place.

Altcoin markets are denominated in, and dominated by bitcoin.
Until there is a time when one will use an altcoin to express value of a product, the markets will be dominated by bitcoin.
Hell, btc is the best performing currency in the fiat world for the past 5 years, saying that its dominance is threatened by P&amp;D schemes is comedy material level

Bitcoin is the longest more secure chain available. 
It is the most decentralized and most distributed network by far.
It has the most implementations available and has well over 400 developers in various developer teams working on its protocol, plus a huge number of independant developers working on various projects revolving around it.

Seriously, as a casual user of bitcoin with no skin in the game except tbe success of the protocol, i am flabbergasted with the amount of personal attacks AND at the same time with the lack of any substantial technical ideas people do not have there. 
I started noticing it when people started attacking bitcointalk of censorship AND not enough moderation atvthe same time. 
The .com forum came to be, yet the protocol and tech threads there are full of crickets.

This pattern follows everytime btc goes a bit.higher than the previous ATH: Btc goes up, alts bleed, traders spot them and buy some more, alt prices rise, and that "dominance" ticker shows a minor slip.

Do you mean the childish thinking part? Well it is sadly true. 
One has to be really detached from reality or very young (aka a child?) if he believes that a community and its resources can be run for profit. 
Making a distinction between better tax management and total abolition of community support is needed. 
Taxation is what we have come up after over 10000 years of organised society. Are there instances where tax systems are corrupt or unfair? Yes there are. Is there something that can be done to make it better? Lets go ahead and do it. But abolishing it completely without a measure put in its place to ensure that the less privileged among us will also survive is totally silly, if not even worse.

visa =/= bitcoin 
this is not an apt comparison. Visa is a company that clears transactions between banks. 
Bitcoin is a protocol and the network of the computers using that protocol
There is a scaling roadmap for bitcoin. Just because things are not rushed does not mean they are not getting there.
Keep in mind that bitcoin was never meant to be instant, and some implementations already prune those old transactions.
Full nodes are holding all the tx in the ledger, lite clients exist for instant loading time and usability.

what numbers are you talking about, the ones that are made up?
BTC is the best performing currency worldwide, not only in an obscure crypto market, but in all markets. 
It is performing better than USD, EUR, JPY and lately it has steadily been surpassing Gold.
Is there anything anyone can buy with an altcoin?
Let me repeat, the so called "dominance" metric is a poorly worded attempt at showing the marketcap percentage of a small and obscure market. Until an altcoin comes along that has a better usecase than btc, a wider audience, a larger userbase, it will remain a wordplay.
Of course you can have your opinion and be afraid of an "altcoin dominance", i can see you [here]( in a three month old thread about btc performance trying to say that on each and every year mentioned, some alt did better.
But how dominant is an alt, when it is unusable in every day lfe, and denominated in btc?

OP if you are serious, $5k are not enough to buy, fund and run a BTM.
If you are serious, you should do some decent research in the issues and caveats of this particular business.
Keep in mind that you need to buy tbe machine, pay for installation expenses+rent+whatever other expenses *for installing it* and then comes the hard and expensive part, funding it.
Lets say that your atm serves 4 coins, plus USD.
You need fiat cash in the ATM, say $3k, another bunch of  $$$$ in an exchange to instabuy and cover your reserves, and $3k in BTC, LTC, ETH and whatever crypto it will support. Thats 3 coins x $3k each = $9k in crypto in the machine plus $3k USD = $12k USD worth of assets on day One of operations.
Now, on your second day of operations, if the price of crypto drops, and you have not sold them then you end up with less crypto (in usd terms). Which in turn means that you need to add crypto, from your reserves. If the price drops enough, you end up bleeding quite fast.
It is a high risk business and needs a metric fuckton of liquidity

theft protection was one of the first excuses offered by bitmain only to be cancelled by their later excuses.
bitmain did not have any clue about the owners of the miners, theft protection only works as an excuse if the seller knows who the buyer is.
it was never communicated as a feature after all, and no bitmain customer was informed about the remote kill-switch capabilities of the hardware they were sold
it was downright malice, and if you combine it with the fact that bitmain is subsidized by the chinese .gov and is allowed to operate only because it conforms to directives set by them, it all becomes clear

Print a couple of paper wallets and move your coins there.
Thsi is called "cold storage" and it is the safest way of storing your private keys.
Remember that you have access to your coins **only** if you are holding the private keys that allow you to spend those coins.
Coins in exchanges are owned by the exchanges and the users are holding a promise that the coins are there.
Online wallets are just as dangerous as keeping coins in exchanges.
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:13:11
No, it does not. 
Fees in bitcoin are not a percentage of how many coins you are moving.
You can move $1, $10, $100, $1000, $10000, $100000 worth of bitcoin, all with the same fee.

@_date: 2017-10-28 11:58:04
You need to understand a couple of simple points:
A) Bitcoin fees are dynamic. They are not static. The network adjusts the fees according to a set of rules and variables. This enables the network to adapt at the varying levels of traffic and difficulty, among other things.
B) Fees are expressed in satoshi per byte.
If you read them in usd/byte you are going to have a bad time, because while eg 0.000023 satoshi/byte is exactly that much, that same fee has a different USD cost when btc price is 2000USD and a different cost when btc price is 6000USD.
C) Don't fall in the fallacy of "network X has less fees, therefore it is better/cheaper/faster. Different networks do not have the user base, and the traffic that the bitcoin network has.
D) If you choose to read the fees in USD, the same transaction fee will look more expensive in the future, while it will have cost you the same amount of satoshi per byte.
TL:DR fees looking expensive when expressed in USD per byte are a red herring

Bitcoin is fine, if people wanted faster transactions they would use any of these alts that offer instant transactions.

Reading btc fees in usd is a red herring and if you are doing it after itvhas been pointed out to you, you come across as disingenuous.
Visa charges usd. Bitcoin charges satoshi per byte
Bitcoin allows you to freely move your wealth around. Banks dont.
Bitcoin is not asking for permission. You need explicit permission from a bank or a government to use their network.
0.00002 satoshi per byte will always be 0.00002 satoshi per byte. You are reading fees wrong.
You should be using the method that is of most use to you

i would say it is essential, maybe someone with more knowledge on the subject will weigh in, but in short, the software takes the block of transactions and produces a hash, that is a value that represents those bundled transactions. 
Afterwards this is converted into binary, and it also references not only the bundled transactions but also information from the previous block that was created, this is how the chain of blocks (the blockchain) is formed.
Next, the software adds a bit of random data, the "nonce", and then all that is hashed again and compared to the target, an extremely large(256bit) number that all clients share.
The goal is to make sure that the hash of the last block is less than the value of teh target.

an engineer like yourself should already know that when you are not holding your private keys, you do not own the coins. If your coins are in MtGox, then yes, you could be fucked. If the keys are in your posession, MtGox hackers cant touch you.
Anyone having their deposits managed by a third party is taking that risk, Cyprus, Greece and a few others can attest to that.
Banks will join the blockchain projects but they will develop their own private blockchains, that they will be able to control. Bitcoin is not going to be used by itself from a bank, neither will any of the coins out there, it does not make sense for a financial or even a government institution to hand over their monetary control to an uncontrollable project.

Yes. You can print them at home, on your printer, and load them with the desired amount. Some precautions must be taken, as they are suppose to be created offline, preferably with an offline computer, or better yet a live linux distribution.
The process is fairly simpe actually, check out  
In general, you download the open source wallet generator from github, fire up a live distro, open the generator with your browser **while disconnected from the internet** and print away 
But if you set up to print BE VERY CAUTIOUS AND FOLLOW ALL ADVICE THERE.

Bitcoins are created according to the rules in the bitcoin software, the program that computers that participate in the network are running.
This network is currently hashing away 51.234.889.79 petaFLOPS, which is an insane amount of computing power.
This power is used to secure the network propagating the transactions and the creation of new coins. The computers participating are solving some very hard mathematical riddles.
As soon as a solution is found, roughly every ten minutes or so, the computer that made the calculation bundles all transactions into blocks, and transmits the information to the rest of the network, while at the same time is rewarded with 12.5 newly created BTC.
If someone wanted to create more coins, he would have to somehow produce more computing power than at least 51% of the network, or take over that part of it.
Due to tbe distributed nature of the network this is rather difficult  qlthough not improbable to achieve, and there have been times in the past where mining pools came close to that number.
If someone tweaked the software to allow for more coins to be created, the rest of the network would discard his blocks, as the rules followed would be different than those that the rest of the computers follow.

Hello there, and thank you for actually providing an educated reply.
As you pointed out, some alts are beggining to realise real world usecases, which actually reinforces my point of them being a testbed for bitcoin. Segwit, LN are being activated on various blockchains and details on their implementations will be used to refine their implementation in btc blockchain.
Eth &amp; ripple, might look like they are being capitalised by a worldwide banking conglomerate. Banks are playing with the tech and are learning how to use it. Eventually they will be moving in private blockchains for those applications though, as they have been indicating in various publications.
In regards to those two, eth&amp;xrp, they are far from being immutable and decentralized enough though when compared to btc.
Bitcoin anonymity was never part of the plan in any way, except via methods like mixers as you said. Bitcoin was and is pseudonymous, not anonymous. Dash is one of those instamined examples, where the vast majority of the circulating coins were created at the beginning and are owned by a few.
Now, if one is looking for a get-rich-quick scheme, alts are the way to go. Bitcoin is over with the days of unbelievable volatility and it is on a path of stabilising the price trend.
One last note. The so called "dominance" is not really a metric, it means absolutely nothing. It is a made up concept, that when taken out of context is used only as a false indicator for a so-called declining btc use. 
Which is really not true, as one can see in every other metric used. For more o this i would point you to an interesting read that explains the [bitcoin dominance fallacy]( rather well. Besides the reason the author explains there, it is only expectable that as the crypto market grows, sone alts will emerge and secure a position among the market participants.
Bitcoin is not supposed to fill all the niche parts that specialised coins are trying to sprint for, very much like in the fiat world there are various financial instruments for various applications.
Bitcoin is the most secure and longest chain, Its key characteristics are its decentralised and distributed nature, its immutability and resistance to attack and its ability to resist censorship.
There is no altcoin out there with these characteristics, and frankly there is none trying to do that.

it was never meant to be faster than the speed of one block, i'm not sure where you are coming from, but please try to keep up with reality.
Also, btc STILL is cheaper to transact than every other option with real volume out there. I know you probably will say that most alts are cheaper, but that is because noone uses them. 
BTC is cheaper to transact than the legacy system, safer and faster. All the rest are rogers coffee propaganda.

OP did you read the article you posted?
He did not win that amount in a lottery, this is not about luck.
He took part in an auction, he outbid the rest of the participants.
The auction was held by the US Marshal Service and was selling a part of the coins that were confiscated by the seizing of Silk Road

you need some time to be acknowledged as a store, whatever you are selling. You need to spend funds on setting up a shop, or a page, and spend some more on marketing. And then wait for customers.
There will not be many victims for you, when you rob the first customer that lands in your store, and sooner than you think, there will not be a second one.
Businesses rely on reputation to survive, as soon as that is tarnished, poof!!

Andreas is not a leader, he never even implied such a thing. Andreas is one of the evangelists.
Bitcoin is an open source decentralized distributed protocol
It is allergic to leaders. It does not need any. 
Leaders can safely go fuck themselves

Clicking on the link gives me a privacy error, i'm not sure why it does that, but you can remove "np" from the link and visit it.
The OP there is talking about a professional shill/disruptor that leaked info on how his employers used him and others to disrupt certain reddit communities, r/bitcoin included.
I;m sure some of the older accounts here are aware, and i'm also certain many have suspected that. I think it is something that new visitors of r/bitcoin need to take into account, and bear in mind that such disruption/subversion tactics will only grow wider and more vile and direct as bitcoin will keep growing.

lol, no. You are probably talking about price, and you are wrong, in the sense that Bitcoin also trades against all other currencies on the planet, as well as against commoditties like gold.
But, to the point of your reply, price is not value. 
Bitcoin worked without a price tag, and will work regardless of its price.
An immutable borderless decentralized open system of money has immense value. The ability to freely transact with anyone, anywhere without an intermediary has value. It is a paradeigm shift.
The monetary applications we are witnessing these early years are only the beginning.

BitMEX is not a bitcoin exchange, it is a derivatives market, where you can buy futures contracts and swaps in various cryptos, denominated and settled in bitcoin.
Derivative products derive their value from the value of the underlying asset, this can be anything, from gold or oil to wheat and rice.
In BitMEX the index price is derived by the averege price between the three exchanges you mentioned in your post.

Can't go down to 100% if you never bought them with fake money in the first place.
I know quite a few people that use it daily, price only matters to a speculator like me, or a trader.
I got my first coins as a payment for freelancing.
But, sure, price is tanking so the sub is filled with haters now.
Bitcoin does not care for me or you though or the fake money prices anyone bought in. 
Bitcoin worked before it actually had a price, it will keep working with moon prices, or no prices.
Price is irrelevant

You seem to be implying that a borderless permissionless uncensorable immutable open distributed decentralized network that cannot be seized or taken over, has no intrinsic value
Yeah, no, good luck with that XD

The Bitcoin network itself is decentralized. This is all that matters. 
Mining is decentralized enough to not be under anyones control. A huge company with the help of a nation-state tried to impose its will in August 2017, the network forked them out, we watched them crumble in 2018 and they will have to compete with the sharks in their space now, sharks like AMD, Nvidia and Samsung among a few.
Wealth in Bitcoin cant really be measured so you cant say who owns what.
And Bitpay? BTCPay enables anyone to accept bitcoin payments in an automated fashion.
You really do not need to buy into anything. What you can do, is focus on what is being developed by the noumerous independent efforts that collectively are Bitcoin.
