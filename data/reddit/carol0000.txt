In May 2017 he was still holding and saying he believed it would rise even more. I think he is still holding.

If they decide to combine it before you die they can steal your bitcoins, can't they?

Let's be honest, if you are shorting bitcoin there isn't a better moment to do it now than after a Mt. Gox move. That is how it works.

Berkshire doesn't own stocks of Google and Amazon because Buffet doesn't understand what the first one does and because he thinks the second one is a miracle. How is he going to understand bitcoin?? Besides that Berkshire has the same gains of the Sp500 and since the 90s he can't beat it. I think for not comprehend the tech industry he lost all the tech grow and evaluation that were the big stocks in the last 10/15years.

The problem here is that if you're client is not into bitcoin he will suffer a lot during this roller-coaster ride. So I would advise the risks and emphasize of it pretty explicitly. Well he can suffer in both ways, because if he doesn't accept it by your advice and them sees the price triple, quadruple or increase even more in the next halve he will feel pretty bad as well.

The risks to go lower than 5k are huge for Short. Because at this levels small variations for bitcoin environment passes to be huge for margin trade people.
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:55:56
In my opinion this is not future markets only. They are the tools but there is a lack of trust that the price will rise on the short term. So people are shorting bitcoin. And in my opinion the fact that is affecting trust is Mt. Gox. Now everybody nows that if the price rises they will sell again and probably this affects the trust in short term.

In april I wanted to go lower to buy more and was more confident than now that it would go lower than 6k but whales pumped more than 1k in less than 6 hours and rekt a lot of people. There is a plan designed by the whales to accumulate more they short it and then pump it and accumulate. I doubt it will go lower than 5k. And they will pump it a lot on the next bull run after accumulate a bunch of bitcoins.

It is different. Lehman had a lot of mortgage backed securities that default in 2008. But the biggest problem was the credit default swaps. When A rating mortgages entered in default they had billions of dolars to cover.

I think it won't be so bad. I think it will take months until every individual receives their  share. There will a lot of burecreacy to liberate the money, specially because a transaction is irreversible, so you can't have mistakes.

If they decide to sell, it will happen just after September when the next court hearing happens.

He sold a lot of bitcoin at 6k. He was not shorting

Where is the "why bitcoin is a fraud?" Or "has the bubble popped?" or " bitcoin value will go to zero due to regulation says Harvard's economist". 
@_date: 2018-03-13 11:33:39
He isn't. He sold a lot at 6k. Probably panic sold seing the price getting lower and lower. But if he was smart the trust would make a statement saying that he wasn't going to sell  at open market and would make an auction. The prices would go really high and he would sell it better than selling now at open market. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:51:30
I think the positive view is to prove that it is not so easy to short bitcoin. The trust guy wasn't shorting bitcoin. He was selling with little knowledge of how much impact he could do. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:50:01
That is my point of view
@_date: 2018-03-12 02:09:15
The court will meet again only in September to decide what their going to do. But honestly the best thing to do, if is decided to sell the other bitcoins would be to make a statement saying that there is going to be an auction to sell bitcoins. Bitcoin will became highly bullish and they will be able to sell it with a better price even with discount. The other option to sell it at an open market is now highly risk. When the trust decides to move bitcoins to an exchange the price will drop a lot. They are now exposed to sell it cheap if they decide to sell it in a open market. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:31:44
Think on the positive side that if a statement is issued by the trust saying that they will not sell the bitcoins in open market the price will skyrocket.

There is a 2500 bitcoin order at $7800 at bitfinex. The people that shorted bitcoin close to this value were really brave!! 
The margin trade volume for short at bitfinex reduced in more that 50% meaning that people are closing their orders. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:50:33
It was 20k usd. Only the bitcoin mined if sold in open market would require a 32 mi usd influx money daily.  That isn't real by now.

But the ETF needs to hold the asset. It isn't like a future contract that is made for protection. Iif this happens it is great news. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:04:02
It was but this is different. He wasn't shorting which has a risk, he was just selling something that isn't his. He sold it without the worry of buying it again, which is why the price dropped that much.

If the crash affects the trust in banks there is a huge chance of money go to bitcoin.

A 20% Dow dip generates a pessimistic felling that will led business to cut jobs and investments which can easily lead to recession.

So if something like 2008 happens again and the government doesn't have money which is probable in a next crisis, than  it might happen. It almost happen in several countries in 2008, in several banks. The banks limited the withdrawal amount of each person.

His government plans to increase the expenses in usd4tril in next 4 years. He is creating tariffs, destroying trading agreements, reducing immigration, everything that inflation likes. Besides that he cut taxes to put gasoline in the fire. With the increase of inflation the treasury bonds yields will go higher. Mortgage rates are increasing and will get way more higher due to treasury bonds.  I wonder when mortgage rates 6% how much the price of the houses will fall. The stock market will have a huge correction  for sure.

Stock market have strange products like the ETF Vix. All of them felt more than 80% in one day which is impressive even for people that has bitcoin.

I think it is bitfinex. I am using bittrex.com and it is ok.

You can check margin trade volumes for short and long term at bitfinex and okex. It is a good thermometer for the market.

10y Treasury bonds yields are close to 3% and they will print 4 trillion more in the next couple of years. I bought apple in the dip at 155/share and the yields are close to 1.8%. If the yield of treasury bonds gets close to 4% the stock market retraction will be huge.
Besides that there is a huge chance of inflation in the next couple of years. Yes, it seems crazy but if things work for lightning I think bitcoin has a huge chance of work and hit the 1 million dollars mark.

It works most of the time because the more people follow this rules, more chance it has of became true. Not because this is a pattern of what happens with stocks. It is like a pump and dump group without setting time and coin, just following some rules.

I had the same thoughts for the stock market, but then you realize that the more people think about it and follow, the chance of happening increases. Today I see technical analysis as common signals that a big community see to buy and sell.

If bitcoin dies alt coins are going to die as well. The only way of stop this bear train is to sell the alt coins and enter bitcoin again. Until the market understand that there are buyers. Now there aren't and people are shorting bitcoin so easily that it won't stop it so soon.

Be patient, breath and calm down. It will take a time, but prices will recover!!! A lot of people sold it in situations close to yours before 2017 and I bet they regret.

In my opinion it will be approved because the stock market is in the last run and everybody knows it. After the bear market begins how will investors earn money??
