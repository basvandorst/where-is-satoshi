Hey, this is Mason from BitGo. Just wanted to provide some guidance... at the risk of receiving negative commentary and down votes, but I say this because I care about you as a BitGo customer :-)
As we mentioned earlier, there has been "no evidence of a breach to any BitGo servers. This means that customers may continue using the service as usual.
You can also read our most recent statement here: 
One thing that I do personally recommend for large BTC holders -- since users have 2/3 keys or a single key (the second being with a KRS (key recovery service)) -- is that you ensure that you have your BitGo Keycard, incase you need to perform a recovery of your funds in the event that BitGo is unreachable or that you lose your password.
I also typically recommend that you ensure that you have your 2FA setup code (if you have Google Authenticator setup) printed out and stored in a safe place in the event that you lose your two-factor authentication device. Another options is to setup multiple two factor authentication devices (which is an option) in the event that you lose one of your devices.
As far as safety, users have the option to generate the third key offline (and to just provide the pub upon wallet creation), to generate two of the three keys in the browser, or to generate one key with the KRS, one key in the browser, and the third key being generated on BitGo servers. With all models you can ensure that BitGo does not have the power to move your funds without your control. With the KRS model you can assume the same and that also the keys are not compromised during the key generation phase (as with the provide your own 3rd key model) since each key is generated in a different location.
All transactions done in the web-client do require two factor authentication before funds can be moved as well as for other sensitive account changes. This means that even if your account credentials are compromised, an attacker would also need access to your two-factor authentication device to move your funds.
This isn't the case with most wallets as they typically have the power to move funds with a single-key and can be off-chain solutions (meaning that the transactions do not benefit from the integrity of the Bitcoin blockchain). 
If you have any further questions please feel free to message me on here or to contact our support at support

Am contacting you on behalf of BitGo, please send me a DM and we can work through this :-)
@_date: 2016-08-14 05:19:18
Happy to help. We generate three new keys when a new wallet is created.. would you be able to clarify what you mean by 'keycard that goes with the random seed'?

BitGo is a 100% on-chain multi-sig solution that allows users to hold 2/3 of their keys. As a result the fee is calculated and set in the client during the transaction build process and goes to the Bitcoin network :-) 
I spent some time trying to reproduce the Google Authenticator bug and was unable to. Would you be able to DM me your browser and system specs so that I can take a look.

100% agree. Added the disclaimer under the 'how to' instructions. Operating under assumption that if someone already has a node setup, they understand the risks and have done their own diligence.

Rightfully so - this is an experimental network. We're excited to help test out a new revolutionary technology.

I appreciate your diligence. Changed it to this:

Hello Flexxkii, Mason from BitGo here.  Sorry to hear you ran into an error, why don't you try the web interface:  If you're still having issues just drop us an email at support and we can walk you through it.
@_date: 2016-03-12 22:56:13
You'll be able to reach the project owners on the 21 slack at  or on twitter at 
@_date: 2016-03-13 00:53:36
They seem to be pretty active on there  The payment goes out instantly when the pull request is accepted.

Hey Guys, Mason from BitGo here:
If you guys are looking to transition, we'd be happy to help you get on the BitGo API, currently used by the major exchanges (Bitfinex, Bitstamp, etc.). If interested, we can open up a public slack channel to help get through this as soon as necessary.
You can check out the docs here:

Hey Zyklon,
Mason from BitGo here.  We made an html version several months ago, it seems like the link was taken down, my apologies. I just put it back up in the repo description, please give it a try:

A lot of us Bitcoin companies are trying to do the best when it comes to privacy, and we generally do a very good job in comparison to other industries. Unfortunately there is a tradeoff between privacy / security and usability. This won't be the case forever but currently the tech that we have requires us to make those tradeoffs. When the cost of running a node on your device is trivial we'll be able to achieve better solutions.

BitGo has both email and SMS notifications

Ah yes, there is also this implantable-satellite connected fullnode you can get on Open Bazaar. It provides a 1mV shock (nothing painful) whenever you receive a transaction, mine's installed on the upper portion of my Trapezius. No phone or email necessary for this
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:15:09
How can we make it better?
@_date: 2015-08-24 23:24:36
It may not be available to all customers just yet, but if it has been made available to you it can be found under Account Security.
@_date: 2015-07-14 14:50:28
At one point there were about 20,000 unconfirmed transactions this past week. It seems like BitGo has incorporated dynamic fees to make sure the transactions confirm within 2 blocks / 20 min
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:46:10
this was originally intended to help new enterprise customers get up and running with the SDK. We decided to make it public to make it easier for the average dev to get up and running with BitGo as well. Hope you guys like it, excited to hear any feedback
@_date: 2016-02-09 19:02:44
Yes, of course. We enable users to move their funds with or without access to BitGo services

Hello LiteBTC,
Mason from BitGo here, I've just taken a look at your support ticket. We're very sorry to hear that you have been unable to recover your funds, this happens from time to time and it is simply one of the challenges in providing users with full control of their funds.  
As you know our wallet options have always enabled the user to hold 2 of 3 keys. With the model where the user holds two keys, we generate one key on BitGo servers and two in the client and provide both to the user. The user key is encrypted with either the login password or a unique password client-side that we never see. This has always been the case and has yet to change.
Your wallet is an older model, and we thank you for being a longtime customer, however regardless of the model, we have no power over the wallet with our 1-key and so we are unable to move your funds on your behalf into a new wallet or Bitcoin address.
Please let us know if there is anything else that we can help you with :-)

Mason from BitGo here, this guy is spot on. If you don't see a text on your phone when your presented with the two-step verification page then click "resend code" to resend a new one.
@_date: 2015-11-08 16:44:52
This is not 100% accurate. With BitGo's 2 of 3 multisig model, two of the keys are generated client side and only one is stored on BitGo's servers. This creates a situation as follows:
1.  BitGo does not have the power to move Bitcoin on your behalf.
2.  The user has the power to move/recover their Bitcoin whenever they like using the open-source recovery tool or any other similar tool (this one uses the chain API) 
I would say your response is more the case in online wallets with multi-sig/single-sig models that provide the web wallet with control over the user's Bitcoin, however it is possible to create a multi-sig model that still provides the user with control
Disclosure: I am a BitGo employee and a huge fan of our multi-sig model for this reason

Hey Antb,
Mason from BitGo here. 
The malleability attack will only affect the txid that shows up in your account after it is sent out to the Bitcoin network, and not your actual BTC balance (at least with BitGo). 
You can set a webhook to let your server know whenever you receive BTC on your wallet. To ensure that you do not receive a false webhook txid for your transactions you can set min confirms to 1, either way your wallet will self-correct and remove any malformed transactions automatically.  
If you don't set min confirms you will receive a webhook at 0 confirms and 1 confirm as a default. We have been actively monitoring the malleability attack and improving our software as we go on.
If you're offering these services to 3rd parties, I'd recommend creating a wallet per customer, and then generating new addresses from each wallet as 'one-time use' addresses.  This will make it easier for you to keep track of your customers incoming and outgoing BTC balances.
We can sign you on at sales if you'd like, you can check out the API pricing here: (  You can always get started for free and contact us once you are ready to upgrade.

Please do not disrespect our users. 
Here are the facts:
The user has a KRS wallet - 1 key is with BitGo, 1 key is with the user on the keycard, and 1 key is held by the KRS (keyternal). Knowledge of the contents of the KeyCard does not provide access to the funds.
If the user has their KeyCard they will be able to reset your wallet password under your wallet settings using Box D without need for a KRS.
The user will be able to recover their funds through our KRS recovery process by contacting support

Hey Fidasx,
I assure you that we do not run windows 95 here at BitGo :-) and that wallets don't simply disappear since we are 'on-chain'. 
I can see where the confusion occurred with our wallet sharing feature which is typically used by enterprises. Can you please message me privately and I can sort this out for you.
