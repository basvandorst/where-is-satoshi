The current value of BTC is propped up by over $2bn in USDT.  If it turns out that every USDT is not backed 1:1 by USD, then the value of BTC has been artificially inflated, and will fall to match the amount of actual USD in the market.

The concept of a watcher node only exists because your channel partner cannot be trusted.  You need to actively monitor the channel and submit a penalty transaction if they misbehave. 


In practice, how likely is it that every user will also run their own watcher node service?  99% will use a trusted third party to secure their channel funds.

I'm not convinced that high availability nodes is a solution.  Requiring five nines for a LN node to securely function means that it will inevitably centralize to one or two major players while those who run nodes from home are pushed aside.

I never said it was confirmed, I explained why the BTC price would crash if Tether's reserves weren't what they claimed they are.


That's not really a meaningful measurement, as USDT traded to BTC then sold for USDT would register as more volume than the value that is actually being transferred.  
$2bn in raw market value being wiped out would be substantial.

From the article:


Their official statement on the matter is that Friedman was being too thorough, and taking too much time to complete a proper audit, so they would prefer *not having any audit instead*.

I'm not sure I follow your logic. I just explained how one channel partner can steal funds by exploiting another's trust, and you just pointed out how you will need to seek out trusted channels to avoid wonky nodes.
You will also need a trusted node to watch the blockchain and ensure your channel partner is not attempting to defraud you in order to use LN securely.

You seem to misunderstand how the LN works. 
Assuming one open channel Bob&lt;-&gt;Alice and one open channel Alice&lt;-&gt;Eve, Bob can send money to Eve by routing through Alice and does not need to open a Bob&lt;-&gt;Eve channel.

I expanded on that [in my comment here](

"It's very safe.  The system ensures that only the latest signed balance sheet can be used to unlock the money".
Unfortunately, that is not true, and is IMO the biggest flaw with LN at the moment.
Consider an alternative example to the one from the video:
Bob opens a channel with Coffee Shop with 0.05 BTC of his funds and 0 BTC from Coffee Shop.
Bob comes in every day that week and spends 0.01 BTC/coffee, recording 5 transactions.
The Coffee Shop owner goes out of town and locks up for the weekend.  Since they are no longer online and maintaining the channel, and since the transactions over LN are already signed by the Coffee Shop's private keys, Bob has an opportunity to lie about the history of their off-chain transactions. 
He broadcasts a channel close using one of the week's previous transactions where his balance is 0.04 BTC.  Because Coffee Shop is not online to broadcast the real final invoice, Bob is able to steal 0.04 BTC from the channel after the auto-close timeout.

Unfortunately, deflationary currencies also remove certain avenues for wealth redistribution from the economy.   Deflationary economies see reduced (or even eliminated) incentive to lend like we see in inflationary economies.  
Forget asking the bank for a loan for your home purchase or startup, because they can just hold the money and see it appreciate without risking a default by lending it to you.

Two seconds of research shows [outputs are down significantly as well](

In an ideal world where no poor people exist, your point is valid.  However in practice there will be those disadvantaged and deflationary economies put them at a significantly higher disadvantage.
In an inflationary economy, actors are decentivized from leaving money rotting under their sofa by the devaluation of unused capital.   This pushes incentives to lend out unused capital, providing opportunities for those without to borrow and move upwards.
In a deflationary economy, actors are decentivized from lending money because money under your sofa appreciates in value, while capital lent out has a risk of default.  In a deflationary economy, the opportunity for those at the bottom to borrow to move upwards no longer exists.  
The [Great Depression]( is essentially what happens in a deflationary economy.

What?  It clearly shows output yesterday at the lowest point in the last 2 years. 


You are literally making up facts.

Literally anyone who has ever purchased a home through a mortage or used a bank loan to start their business would disagree with you there.
