Buying to sell on Bitstamp. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 22:57:30
I bought at 10 cents and sold at 30 cents. He was spot on.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:01:56
Hmmm...any update?
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:16:58
We will stress test the exchanges. The early bird dumpers are out right now.
@_date: 2014-02-06 03:49:23
Don't wait just pay and go.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:34:22
When a bubble pops it goes down.
@_date: 2014-01-19 01:46:23
Especially with the difficulty pushing 2 billion. You'll be lucky to mine a whole bitcoin before the thing dies.
@_date: 2014-01-19 01:50:06
Couldn't find a recent commercial online and I don't see Overstock commercials during the times I watch TV. Pretty cool though.
@_date: 2013-12-28 04:56:23
North Korea buying bitcoins! Buy now before they buy them all!
@_date: 2013-09-07 23:58:07
MtGox is still king. Price goes up and bitstamp, btce go up. MtGox goes down the others go down. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:28:22
They have like 170,000 worth $125,000,000 right now. They will be at a billion soon.
@_date: 2013-07-31 00:51:10
Hard to get your money out of GOX so everyone goes to coinbase to sell so they can charge a lower price and get away with it.
@_date: 2013-08-27 06:32:14
Yeah, the chance to get out of GOX cheaply as possible. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 03:42:53
Don't get left behind. Still time to buy in before it hits $100
@_date: 2013-08-17 04:20:30
I heard he died in the 2011 tsunami in Japan.
@_date: 2013-08-27 06:40:52
Someone has millions of dollars and they don't want gox handling their money any longer and bought. 
@_date: 2013-08-17 07:31:10
There is a chatroom that talk about recent news at 
@_date: 2013-08-17 05:58:41
Well, the sooner you get it the better. A few people could set up mining farms and the difficulty may shoot up to 200,000. If the price goes down you'll be mining for well over a year. So unpredictable that for some it is better to just get their money back.
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:14:47
Just wait till BTC China and Gox add Litecoin. $$$$$$$
@_date: 2013-08-20 08:37:22
About 5 months too late. I would move those bitcoins to BTCE and buy litecoins. Wait for mtgox to add litecoin and profit during the pump.
@_date: 2013-07-11 01:11:04
Currently pumping before the dumping. Classic pump and dump.
@_date: 2013-08-20 08:45:21
Sneezes as in we have no ETA a dump will happen.
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:28:07
Ya I got a friend like that. "Dude when is your cash out point." "Dude I just looked at the chart. Holy shit you are still in right?"
Ya dude. Told you to buy some. You make $85,000 / year you can afford a few a couple months ago...
@_date: 2013-11-09 08:38:43
I heard they are manually doing it all. So no the outlook has only gotten worse.
@_date: 2013-11-17 00:25:10
Dropped down to $415 yesterday then went to $477.
@_date: 2013-11-06 07:02:25
I read there was some computer fuck up and they fixed it after the bank cut off time and everything is delayed. Should show up in a day or two.
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:12:02
You see a few months ago every was saying, "China is buying in." The truth is China wasn't. Finally btcchina.com came to life and China finally started buying in. 3 weeks later everyone doubled their money. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:24:21
Drop it like it's hot.
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:59:29
On their facebook page they said they were having problems this week.
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:24:26
US banks are not open till Tuesday. You'll get your money Thursday I believe. No problems sending from blockchain to coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:21:19
China almost at $400. Gox must keep up...

So he is most likely not in jail.
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:10:50
You don't want to make the dev rich by buying their 60 cent coin?
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:21:59
The price will go down when the people with thousands of bitcoins sell. I don't know any so I can't ask them when they will be selling.
@_date: 2013-11-09 08:30:33
You are getting in at just the right time. There is a term called "whale" which means people with millions of dollars that buy in which raise the price. It only takes 7 to 10 million dollars to raise the price $100. With China, USA and all the other countries around the world buying in it doesn't take much to raise the price. Buy as much or as little as you want and enjoy the ride up.
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:31:26
@_date: 2013-07-12 05:09:58
Ride the wave of the other panic buyers. Then sell at the top.
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:21:21
It's what the buyers / sellers at the exchange has decided. Based on fees, how easy or hard it is to get money in and out. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:57:14
Eh, they sent a ACH transfer asking for the money. The bank says, "Sorry, there is not enough money in this account." The bank rejects it and issues you a fee. 
You e-mail coinbase and they are basically saying, "dude your bank account didn't have enough money so buy with the amount of money you have in your account next time."
Seems fair. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 02:22:34
I want to FBI to dump all 170,000 bitcoins at once and cause Gox to lag for hours. Finally when the lag clears bitcoin is only a couple dollars. Then the FBI uses the $20,000,000 or so they have to buy in. 
That would be crazy. 
@_date: 2013-08-18 00:07:04
108,000 new bitcoins per month. Eventually someone with a lot of bitcoins will dump over and over and the price will come down over the next 3 years.
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:00:11
Rarely down. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 06:44:33
Forgot blunts.
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:18:20
Cool story. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:50:26
I heard they ran out of bitcoins the other day. That's probably why they had to cancel on you.
@_date: 2013-08-17 23:57:52
I bought 50 bitcoins when it was around $10-$30. Was thinking real hard / contacting someone localbitcoins.com about buying another 200 bitcoins but never did it. Eventually I had a little more then $10,000 at the peak (could have been $40k-$50k if I bought more.) Well I went to bed and woke up with under $5,000 after the crash. If only I bought 250 bitcoins. Sold near the peak for $40,000. Bought back in when it hit $50 and then sold when it hit $150 I could have over $100,000. 
Then I tried playing the market and lost $4,000. So in the end I lost money messing with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-08 02:18:57
I used Google to find a source for you. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 15:51:37
If the price stays around $700 for a few weeks I can see someone or a group of people start buying and other people join in. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:26:38
Ugh, where is the next up and coming coin so I can buy now before everyone else does. Bitcoin, litecoin, namecoin all too high now.
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:03:43
He should have hired someone to do his dirty work.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:56:59
I sold low and bought back higher :(
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:18:26
As others have said it isn't coinbases fault. You sold so their computer put in a request to send money to your account. Then you bought and the computer sent a request to take the money. It goes through the bank process and the bank system did the buy first. Not like coinbase could have controlled this.
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:07:39
Just checked and both are up and working for me.
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:05:55
The thing is every time we hit $1,000 there will be people that cash out and bring the price down. Then more people buy in. Eventually most people with thousands of bitcoins will have sold and the rest will hold. Then the people with hundreds of bitcoins will sell and bring the price down a little. Eventually everyone holds and when people sell 100 bitcoins it'll barely move the price. More people buy in and the price keeps going up. That's how we'll hit $50,000. There won't be any big sellers left and there will be mega millionaires wanting to buy in.
@_date: 2013-08-17 04:15:57
The bitcoin difficulty will shoot up to an unbelievable high number by the time you get yours. There doesn't seem to be many shipping and look at the increase.  
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:30:11
Coinbase lets you buy instantly if you add your Visa credit card to the site.
@_date: 2013-08-27 06:38:16
The panic on gox continues to rise. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:08:09
The price not going up or down causing panic.
@_date: 2013-11-17 00:14:08
All my money is in bitcoin so that's the only way I can eat.
@_date: 2013-11-06 07:04:50
Because the price will come back down and you will wish you bought something before the price tanked.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:35:39
I see people saying it'll take a year before they see a profit. They don't think about the difficulty increase. 
@_date: 2013-07-04 06:12:25
50% 4th of July sale happening now.
@_date: 2013-11-09 08:36:34
There are walls people put up to sell and walls people put up to buy. Then people just hold money and don't put up buying walls. 
So when there is a quick sell off of 2,000 bitcoins the bots kick in and buy the price up and put up some buy walls so even though the price went down $20 that in a matter of minutes the price is close to where it was before the sell off.
Reason why it goes up so quick is it only takes around $1,000,000 to raise the price $10. So say a group of guys all want to buy in with a million dollars the price goes up $50. Get enough people wanting to buy in the price goes up $150 in a week. Assuming no one sells enough to lower the price a lot the sooner you get in the better. 
Then why sell when the price is going to go up. People are thinking hedge funds and billionaires may throw in some money and they may just be waiting for the price to hit $1,000 first. So get in now before the price goes up another 5-10 times. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 01:18:21
Hell yeah. Sucks I missed out on cheap bitcoins though.
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:27:06
I believe someone would have to sell a lot and I'm talking 20,000+ to keep the price down otherwise people will buy the price back up to where it was and by the time you find out the price tanked it is too late to buy. Last time the big crash was caused by all the sites going down or lagging bad. If gox didn't lag so bad I bet the dumping would have stopped and the price would have gone right back up to $266.
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:52:45
If you put up a buy or sell order and cancel it you get all your money or coins back.
@_date: 2013-07-11 01:07:53
Man, I had coinbase.com open. I put 50 bitcoins in. The price was $67 and I would get my bitcoins on Friday. 
How I wish I clicked submit.
@_date: 2013-08-17 07:26:31
Damn, sucks. I also think if people were not scared of gox the price would be tanking right now. So bitcoin is risky right now. Most people don't see it that way.
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:54:13
Bitcoins are bitcoins. You buy them and depending on the exchange you go by that is the price of the bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-09 08:32:33
So many people buy that they run out of bitcoins to sell. So they flag you as high risk and ask you to buy again later (and hopefully they have more bitcoins then).
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:03:46
Cause they want to get rich quick and then brag to their friends and say I told you so.
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:18:55
 and the chat on the right will help you if you need it.
@_date: 2013-10-26 04:05:04
I'm guessing they know a guy who knows a guy with a billion dollars that'll write a check and have the bitcoins transferred to them.
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:25:20
I have 0 bitcoins currently :(
@_date: 2013-09-02 07:28:49
Back up. Tanking
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:00:29
Someone sold thousands of bitcoins yesterday after the bad news. Then today they are doing a DDOS to cause more panic so everyone sells. Then they buy thousands of bitcoins for a lower price.
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:34:19
Depends if you believe rumors or not.
