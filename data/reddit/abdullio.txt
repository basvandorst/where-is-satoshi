Ah so you know this, how, exactly? Using the same keen perception that allowed you to get Moler's sex wrong? "New types" of materials doesn't sound like something I would expect to appear in commercial products within 5 years.


That's a left field comment if I ever saw one. "Secret military industrial complex materials". Sounds, really secret and military. Not sure what your point is though.


Never expected it to, but the point is I'm not some guy that just heard of quantum computing yesterday.


I'm sure there are, and I'm sure there are many here with less. Add this to your list of spurious points.

Assuming the owner(s) of the very limited set of Quantum computers only wanted to crack Bitcoin. I'm no quantum computing expert, far from it, but I have done a crap load of reading in the past on quantum mechanics and have a pretty good idea what it's about. I'm also no cryptography expert, but have a pretty good idea how a lot of that works (I assume most of us here are interested in it). Am I wrong in thinking that even if the IBM cloud quantum computer (5 qubits) was sitting in every living room right now, it would still be useless? By the sounds of the article, you'll need at least as many qubits as encryption key bits, then more again for error correction, then sophisticated algorithms to manage all that. So yeah, 5 years. Not a chance.

Right and I think that is the primary (or one of the primary) reasons for the $20 that keeps coming up right now. That should increase over time with greater adoption and confidence and easier to use software. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-05-01 03:44:19
Sure, but my question isn't about now, but what we could expect when things are fully developed and operational.
I understand that right now, don't put in what you aren't willing to lose. Sounds a lot like crypto in general. :D
@_date: 2018-05-01 01:08:19


You did it *again*. You added "right now". My original question was "The payment amount *(in future)* shouldn't matter should it?". I'm not talking about "right now". Forget "right now". I'm talking end game.
So you have said 3x in you last post that the LN isn't for $20+ transactions. To me, that seems completely asinine, because when I think about payments I need to make that I want to be fast and cheap, I really can't think of too many that fall under $20. As a guess I would say that 90% of the payments I would make on a daily basis that I would want to be fast and cheap, would be over $20. Payments under $20 just don't happen that often. So when someone says "*The intention of lightning network isn’t for $20+ transactions.*" it makes me think said network is going to me pretty useless. UNLESS it's not really limited to $20 or less.


So, now we are getting somewhere. This statement seems somewhat contradictory to where you say multiple times that the LN is not for transactions over $20. It kind of makes me think that every time you say "not over $20" you really mean something else entirely not related to price at all. Perhaps something like "The LN is not for low volume, high value transactions where time is not of the essence". AND this is why I asked the original question about payment amount. A limit on payment amount makes no sense at all, but then you keep re-iterating $20 like it's some hard coded limit in the LN protocol or something, which is what I wanted to clarify.
So, let me ask this question. Do you think that $20 is a reasonable limit? I mean there are issues with LN like needing sufficient liquidity in channels and so on, so is the $20 that keeps coming up just an arbitrary limit, or do you think it really will be a practical consideration for most LN transactions? I think I could work a system with a limit of $500, but anything as low as $20 would be utterly pointless and useless.

OK. Thanks. Trying to get a straight answer to that question has been harder than you'd think. I'm new to LN in the sense I never really dug into the details before. It might be obvious if you are familiar with it, but it wasn't for me.

@_date: 2018-05-19 13:48:31
Assuming that's what I assumed is also a little curious. Take my comments at face value. I was responding to the claim in the article. Sure, if we are to consider government backed actors, commercial viability is not a necessity, but that was not something I was thinking about in my initial reply. Clearly, though, I was one of the few! :)
@_date: 2018-05-04 00:11:45
Value boils down to what people ascribe to something, which can be highly dependent on their needs and/or wants at the time. A hungry person will value food more highly. A person who isn't hungry may throw away perfectly good food. If I need a paper weight, your rock might have value to me. "sell me that pen".
EDIT: Yeah, so if your point was that BTC doesn't acquire intrinsic value just because money went into mining it, I missed that and I agree. The fact money is required to mine it (versus an ICO token that magically comes into existence at someone's say so) will likely create the psychological conditions for people to ascribe a higher value, I would think. It's arguable though. Of course we see people ascribing very high values to nothing more than vague promises by strangers, these days. Value really is subjective.
@_date: 2018-05-01 08:06:04
Thanks for the clarification. Awesome work by the way.
@_date: 2018-05-01 03:22:24
Good to know. Makes sense to me. I hope that's the general consensus. In the meantime I'll ignore people who say micro-transactions or &lt;=$20. :)
@_date: 2018-05-19 14:03:08
No I don't concede that. Sounds like science fiction to me.
The reason I mention "commercial" is because of the article. How about you try reading it????
*Krishna is certain that within five years there will be widespread commercial use of quantum computers.*
@_date: 2018-05-19 04:10:54
*Moler said we still need additional breakthroughs, such as new types of materials with specific properties at temperatures at near absolute zero.*
Need *new types* of materials, but don't worry, they'll be widely commercially available in 5 years (according to the IBM guy, who probably owns a lot of IBM stock).
As a software engineer of 20 years, with a mechanical engineering degree, I also call bullshit. Furthermore, these types of FUD claims ignore economics.

WTF is right.

So it's going to depend on routing and funding of channels. I assume routing will try to find a path with sufficient liquidity. The smaller the amount, the better the chance.

You are correct about the context, but I don't think the context alters the meaning of those words, hence my confusion.
That said, I think I am seeing that the $20 is some arbitrary figure plucked from where the sun doesn't shine. It seems to be fundamentally about the necessity to remove high volume transactions from the block chain, and in many cases they will be low value*, but not necessarily.
*For me, low value would mean up to $250, as a rough indicator.
Thanks for the answer.

I have no illusions that when it comes to quantum computing, I don't know shit. When it comes to mathematics, I am no better than average. When it comes to quantum theory, I barely understand the basics. When it comes to cryptography, see my comment on mathematics.
I'm calling BS on the basis of the fact that I know, from my own experience, how long even simple things take to turn into real products in the fields of software and engineering. That knowledge, combined with what we know about the actual development of quantum computers that could actually achieve this feat, we are definitely more than 5 years off having commercial solutions that can do that. That is my opinion and as you know, opinions are like arseholes. I can't speculate on information that is not public knowledge.


To me this is the definition of FUD. I find it hard enough to stick to things we know about rather than the realm of conjecture and imagination.


This is what I think is more likely. Call me a sceptic.
If the NSA is already cracking encryption with quantum computers we are all fucked, but I really doubt it, personally. There's no public record of any such machines capable of that kind of feat in existence. Modern research papers are still talking about *10 qubit* systems. The NSA might be powerful, but quantum computing is right up there with one of the most difficult things humanity has ever tried to accomplish.
So, if you want to keep track, if there are commercially available Quantum computers (that a business or corporation with enough money can buy and use privately) that are capable of cracking Bitcoin within 5 years from today's date, I will eat my own dick. ;)
EDIT: Hark below, pretty much sums it up... (compare "order of magnitude more physical qubits than 4000" to research papers talking about 10 qubits).
*The amount of qubits to break something like ecdsa (they believed it would take 4000 logical qubits which requires an order of magnitude more physical qubits) is so far off that at this point it was purely theoretical to them if it was even possible.*
Let's make 5 years, 20 years, if I still have enough teeth by then.
EDIT2: Just created myself a reminder. 7,305 days to go.

Try going beyond the headline, and think about who is writing the article, the context in which the comments were made, who is making the comments, who they are making them to, and also the visible reality of the situation (that can be ascertained through some basic research). 


MY trolling?!? "Picking out typos"?!? Oh, so you claim the sex thing was a typo? I bet it wasn't, but who cares? The point is that YOU claim that this...
*we still need additional breakthroughs, such as new types of materials with specific properties at temperatures at near absolute zero.*
... means 
*publicly acknowledged materials that are published and available for widespread R&amp;D*
Call me an idiot, but those two things sound not even remotely alike. How much materials testing research have you done in your life?


Possibly your best comment yet. Your point is that I HAVE NO IDEA what is going on in the NSA. The implied point, however, is clearly that YOU DO know what is going on inside the NSA. Well, I am clearly talking to someone who has contacts well above my pay grade. You got it all figured out.
Take it easy mate.
@_date: 2018-05-19 07:31:54


There's some discontinuity between either.
a) What IBM says (or what people write about them)
b) Current Quantum computing research 
Or c) Some other third factor, like a potential lack of understanding of the difference between what IBM is doing and what the researchers are doing, on my part. I would expect that entanglement is necessary to crack encryption. If you understand the difference here, please let me know.
Pretty sure I read that IBMs public cloud system was only 5 qubit, but even if it is 20, its still tiny. And having a cloud based interface is a far fetch from a product that someone can walk away with. That said, maybe I am looking at that the wrong way. Maybe these systems will always be cloud based and my interpretation of "commercial use" is off base.


For data that is encrypted now, that can be captured and archived, and de-crypted later and will still have value when it is eventually de-crypted, sure. With something like BTC, if ECDSA was replaced, I would expect that everything could be re-encrypted or at least made secure enough so that cracking the old encryption didn't matter. So if that is at least partially right, then I don't see those two cases as exactly the same.
EDIT: From the IBM article you linked...
*The announcement should perhaps be treated cautiously, though. Andrew Childs, a professor at the University of Maryland, points out that IBM has not published details of its system in a peer-reviewed journal. “IBM’s team is fantastic and it’s clear they’re serious about this, but without looking at the details it’s hard to comment,” he says.*
*Childs says the larger number of qubits does not necessarily translate to a leap in computational capability. “Those qubits might be noisy, and there could be issues with how well connected they are,” he says.*
@_date: 2018-05-01 02:15:45
I don't have time to dig through that, but it seems dubious that James would waste his time doing something that used "an entirely different protocol". Not saying you are wrong... I need to review it further.
EDIT: I guess it is. Must still have some relevance though, for it to be a sticky in Sounds like the implementation has some benefits over others (and some cons).
@_date: 2018-05-01 03:14:07
Thanks for the link. I skimmed the paper and it doesn't really seem to answer my question because it doesn't seem to discuss the motivations in terms of use cases. Maybe that's your indirect point? That the design doesn't care about price (or use case), and is solely about the mechanism for shifting transactions to a second layer? Help me out here. I'd rather a direct answer than having to solve riddles, if it's all the same to you. :)
@_date: 2018-05-07 04:45:41
Agreed, but too quick in either direction is not good, because if it goes up too quick, people want to cash out to a more stable store of value to lock in gains. If it goes down too quick then it doesn't meet the definition.

I was asking the same thing just below, but having trouble getting a logical answer. I would argue that without payments larger than $20, LN will be pretty useless. I can't think of many payments that I need to make (that need to be fast and cheap) that are under $20.
@_date: 2018-05-04 00:02:00
That's the problem sir; you are mixing the term "inherent" (objective) with "value" (subjective).

No, on a topic about software and the mechanics of materials, it has zero relevance. That's why in the article they don't mention that Moler is a physics professor.
