I agree, the price posts are fun but get pretty stale, have struggled to find many decent posts worth reading in December.

Brave post, welcome to the club

Wow thanks for making that easy. Good to know. I guess I will store my coins in cold storage and then I'll only have to move them if any forks happen. Cheers

Alright thanks I'll look into it more

Thanks for the reply, by shitcoins I just mean other coins, don't have a big holding of many. I just didn't want the "all other coin that isn't BTC" people to remind me. Thanks

I have been making small buys with a little spare cash here and there since about June. Recently came into a bit of money and want to make a decent buy, do you think it's greedy to stall any longer, I think the price right now is great to buy... I'm just not sure if to just keep dipping in on pull the trigger and buy up what I plan on investing in total. Would love some opinions.

 you can quite easy get sucked into having a feed full of xrp fanboys and shills if youre not careful so just stick to legit people and they will retweet or mention anything worth reading imo

If you don't over follow you generally get an amazing up to date feed. I have stopped reading posts here mostly because it's neckbeards arguing and shit posting.

Flew the same airline back in August, used coinbase and worked just fine. Why would you expect it not to work? just because of the temperamental in-flight wifi signals?

It was great, i was on a flight to Australia from europe and a friend of mine needed some cash within the hour and bitcoin saved the day. I just wish at the time i was flying with somebody to talk to it about at the time :)

I love seeing these pricks getting owned by the bull

They are fronting all the risk setting up the ATM and supplying it with bitcoin. Damn right they should have a good mark up on it
