I'm just speaking for the people who have known this is what needs to happen for like a year or 2 now and are just sick and tired of the attack and bitcoin preventing it. We always need reminders though. Cheers.

This is an extremely ignorant comment. This is a sub for bitcoiners who support bitcoin. That sub is a sub used as an attack on bitcoin. What problems does this sub even have? And please don't give me the "censorship" bullshit. All subs need moderation from an attack brigade....or are you just trying to keep sewing discord among the community and spreading fud?

Good point, I still don't follow the argument as to why there shouldn't be 2 listings for what is now 2 separate tokens with "fixed" supply, demand, and high volume. Sounds like they are just annoyed that their PPC coin isn't high up? Now, if we are talking something like Ripple or other ICOs with the ability to alter supply at the push of a button, then I agree there is a problem.

Really simple. The cat is 100% out of the bag, so all trolls and shills are 100% identifiable as well. Bitmain is trying to compromise as many players in the industry as possible to protect their precious asicboost by strangling bitcoin development and protocol upgrade. Oppose Jihan Wu, Roger ver and Bitmain and Support Core, Segwit and UASF if you want to see bitcoin reach it's true potential.

I mean space as we know it does not exist. We've been lied to. There are no "stars", "planets" or things of that nature. We are not on a spinning ball hurtling through space. We live on a stationary plane. The sun and the moon are the same size and are much smaller than we are lead to believe and are only about 3000 miles away from us.

@_date: 2017-05-03 21:31:33
No. Miners blocked segwit on ltc same as bitcoin. When litecoin went toward UASF, f2pool threatened the litecoin network. Shortly after, they back down in fear from UASF threats and a meeting with the chinese miners was arranged. Jihan and co demand litecoin agree to an extremely uneccessary blocksize increase for them to unblock segwit... and only as bait in hopes they can acheive the same with bitcoin. The litecoin foundation agreed to this move (not without backlash from some of the community) and now many view litecoin as being centrally controlled and now under chinese miner jurisdiction. This is how I saw it go down. I was extremely disappointed with how it went and also the community reaction (they mostly just care about short term price).

Segwit increases tx capacity. This is so stupid. Don't you get tired of being proven wrong over and over again?

It is, you're just reading it wrong.

Dumb as fuck idea. Whoever has he most bitcoin gets the most votes. Try thinking.

So, fyi you don't have evidence for the current accepted cosmology...you just have appeal to authority.

Yes! Love that song. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:24:30
Because it's being pumped.....and once it's dumped they will go back to their holes and cry again. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 23:31:54
Nothing wrong with that at all...as long as you aren't so attached to your trades that you feel compelled to make public service announcements about your personal financial choices, and then make additional public statements about your emotional well being following those personal financial decisions. OP is way too emotional for his own good.
@_date: 2017-05-02 22:04:51
Someone gets it. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 23:38:48
Troll alert. We already know what Jihan wants...and that's to keep covert asic boost. These suggestions are naive at best and only purpose served are to slow down true steps forward. **

Willful ignorance. People don't want to hear about something like that. Western medicine hardly acknowledges the epidemic. Many  sufferers report their doctor laughing at them and need to seek help online. If mainstream media didn't tell them, there must be no problem, right?

@_date: 2017-05-03 00:13:43
Yes, hes the reason satoshi went into hiding.
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:26:28
That analogy makes no sense for crypto and it needs to stop now. Such a pointless gimmick to convince people to buy into scams. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:41:30


So cheap?!!?!? It's gone up nearly 1000% in a month and a half....some of you pumpers are so deluded.

@_date: 2017-05-02 17:35:21
In what way does this sound great? Bitpay pushes scaling without segwit and opposes UASF. Now they join with bad actors. Clearly they have been compromised.
@_date: 2017-05-14 22:23:02
No. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:47:55
It's true.

You can try....he's probably well protected by his handlers though.

Any other coin in the lead would have the same or more issues. Many coins have given up their decentralized nature to make changes. Again, watch the video.

If they were pissing their pants they shouldnt have got away with their demands met. Doesnt add up. You have it backwards.

Doubt what?
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:09:20
Should have only sold as much as needed for minimal down payment. You will do better holding bitcoin than dumping it into a house.
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:22:53
Let him ask his handler and get back to you. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 16:57:55
Just doing what he's paid to do. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 00:44:58
Haha you clearly haven't read anything. Reread the discussion and come back.
@_date: 2017-05-04 23:41:26
Which is why I cringe whenever people say they want him to come back and give bitcoin direction. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:19:24

Totally agreed! Preach on brother!
@_date: 2017-05-02 22:55:03
Who cares what the shill troll says? He plays both sides. He will keep the discord going. He's invested heavily in the shitcoin business and his fraternal organization of choice should be questioned by anyone who understands the situation. People need to wake up soon. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 18:47:12
Haha shills get triggered! This is what I'm talking about! 
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:13:38
They are scum shills, trolls, and liars.
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:20:05
No, he forced the litecoin foundation to commit to an unnecessary blocksize increase for him to not block segwit. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:23:56
No reason to diversify into shitcoins except short term gambling to make more btc.
@_date: 2017-05-05 22:29:33
Another moronic statement by a moronic shill.

@_date: 2017-05-05 17:49:17
What did you calculate?
@_date: 2017-05-05 04:39:13
Yeah, I'm assuming they treated it like it was just business income because ~40% makes a lot more sense then. Too bad. This is why most people should see an accountant.

Satellites are all fake. Google image search satellites. They are all cgi. Moonlanding fake, space fake, planets fake, earth is not a spinning ball. Not to sure how else to expand but here check this video exposing the ISS as a hoax: 
Then check out this channel for the rest: 
@_date: 2017-05-04 16:08:40
And the fact that alts are all scams to make more bitcoin anyway.

Triggered. He just said it's not ideal, which it's not. But it's still going to happen as long as miners aren't in bitcoins best interest.

Because it's throwing away usable money. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 17:06:08
For money...or my best guess....they were partered with him all along in an elaborate conspiracy. Anyway, fuck Bitpay. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 17:38:50
Well altcoins are scams (except Namecoin).
@_date: 2017-05-04 23:49:59
If they/you paid 40% when selling their business then they screwed themselves (and should maybe attempt to get it back). 
@_date: 2017-05-01 18:34:38
In before blockchain rollback and strippers lose all their money.

You have to consider that fact that shitpay has been in bed with jihan the entire time as well.

I don't give him credit for shit. Dude is most likely a long standing puppet put in place to shill years ago. He's a bigger idiot than people give him credit for. 99% chance he has to have a handler around behind closed doors.
@_date: 2017-05-02 23:09:26

Wow, what a completely worthless article.

We have the solution. It's called segwit, and you need to stop trolling around here, because it's transparent and sad.
