You mean this post?
From five days ago (after he'd already been waiting 28 days)? And you only got his payment to him an hour ago...
I wouldn't exactly expect him to be singing your praises

You haven't even read his post... Your whole comment is completely irrelevant to his issue.

The moderators can't just write some new code for reddit though.
Best they can do is mess around with the css. Which does allow for some pretty neat tricks, I don't think they would even be able to hide posts from new users. And people not using custom styles would still see the spam anyway.
Correct me if I'm wrong I haven't moderated a subreddit.

Not to be a downer but there's been plenty of bars and cafes in Aus that have been using bitcoin for quite a while. Coinmap lists 15 places accepting bitcoin in Brisbane alone.

Do you have any relation to [cannabit]( Or are you a different company

It's had 5 confirmations. And the transaction was made 50 minutes ago.
That's right on target. It should be getting one conformation every ten minutes.
"So why do u have to wait so long?"
Well, its not a protocol requirement to wait for x amount of confirmations. This is just imposed by bitstickers. The more confirmations there are the less likely that the transaction is a double spend and can be "reversed".
Most cases one confirmation is enough, even 0 confirmations can be ok. And for buying some stickers 6 confirmations is probably overkill. But on the other hand waiting an hour for the 6 confirmations probably isn't going to slow down your sticker delivery anyway.

A real life example would be If satoshi decided to show up again he would sign a message to prove he actually is satoshi. It wouldn't reveal his actual identity but it would show that he is the same person who wrote code and posted on the forum.
Another example would be if im going to have regular conversations with you about whatever (probably something important) I would tell you that I'm always going to use this key. If I don't sign a message with that key or the key is different you know your not talking with me.

Just to state the obvious: it doesn't use bitcoin. 
Why was dogetipbot created when bitcointip was available? Because bitcointip didn't use dogecoin
There's nothing about either currency that makes it better for tipping than the other.

They did their IPO on online exchanges like BTC-TC and Havelock. These work basically like any normal exchange. Some IPO off exchanges with direct shares. In these cases share tracking and trading is done directly by someone in the company
FYI: one bitcoin company is trading on the ASX called [digitalBTC]( Not sure about other exchanges

Yes and yes.
It's like signing your signature on a piece of paper. The first time you sign some paper like that shows that's your signature subsequent times shows it's you again.

Depends on the machine price and the price your paying for electricity and how much power the machine uses and what cooling you need and how much that cooling costs and how much the electricity for that cooling costs.

I'm thinking OPs bitcoin exchange isn't quite as legitimate as coinjars. I'm not sure what the laws are like in Australia for running an exchange.
OPs account may just have been shut down because large amounts were being deposited withdrawn regularly and it may have been flagged. Though unusual that he hasn't heard anything from the back regarding it

You don't need to identify yourself to mine. But a lot of groups do identify themselves.

Its not stuck. It will most likely confirm after a while. 
Its also possible that if it takes long enough to get confirmed and no one is repeating it the transaction that the network will "forget" it. i.e. if you were trying to buy something the receiver would probably keep repeating the transaction since it's in their interest the transaction gets confirmed. 
For future reference if you want to test things you can use testnet.

I agree with what the mod said.
If you haven't engaged with that subreddit at all before. And your history is mainly bitcoin related. And if they don't want their sub to be about selling/promoting things then I think it's reasonably.
That mods reply was reasonable and well explained. And it does seem like your main interest is just promoting bitcoin, which in itself isn't bad just not what they want.
Like he said. If you want to get involved in their community go to one if their meetups. If you want to specifically meet up with bitcoiners then maybe make a post here.
@_date: 2014-04-03 05:25:58

I can only recommend staying far away from IGOT.
I haven't used any others since leaving them. Also interested to know who's decent for Australians.

I had the same thing happen to me. They kept making excuses about  why they weren't able to pay me for weeks.
It wasn't until i told them that i was contacting Aus fair trading, that they were suddenly able to pay me what they owed.
Seems to me like it's just part of their scam. For every person that does kick and shout or follow it up with other authorities there's probably others who just write it off as a loss.
