What's wrong with long term storage? A year ago I was looking for a good way to gift btc to my niece every Xmas. Open dime seemed to be one of if not the best option at that time. What would you suggest? Thanks

Bitcoin's deflationary property is in my opinion one of the main reason it could be widely adopted. At least as a store of value. Even if technically it's bad for the economy which I doubt at the end it should come down to anyone's personal interest/choice.

POS project I'm aware keep creating new tokens to incentivize staking. They need premine tokens to operate and inflation to keep the block reward appealing.

Good news is the same logic would apply if one million btc were bought instantly...

It says between 0 and 30% income tax in Switzerland while crypto gains are considered capital gains which are NOT taxed in Switzerland...

Very interesting read! Energy can't be stored without a significant loss and bitcoin is a way to capture it's value using supply and demand mechanism on a global and open market. In a sense, bitcoin is the first global energy market so we could see a significant impact on energy price around the world leading to rationalize consumption... Probably too simplistic but everyday I'm amazed by the possible outcome re bitcoin. If anyone has other read on the subject please share.

Thanks for sharing. How long would it take to set up roughly for someone with limited IT skills? Any maintenance time to be considered?
Thanks
