I never thought I would write this even a week ago but I am currently waiting for a drop below 8k so I can finally buy again...

Because nature is such a good example?

Not really. Bitcoin has frequent hiccups. It was already up close to 3000 a few months ago. If you invested then, you would have a massive loss.

What world do you live in where tech companies don't use IE?
I am in a top 100 global tech company, we just moved from IE 8 to IE 11 a couple of years ago as a standard application because of the large amount of legacy tools. Of course you can use Chrome or Firefox and most things will work just fine, but official statement will always be to use IE since nobody wants to guarantee that hundreds of tools all work fine there.

600w was about standard for a single GPU setup in the GeForce 7xx era. Consumption has gone down since then

Damn, I couldn't even transfer my money to coinbase fast enough to buy the dip. I guess I'll wait a couple of days for another dip then.

I will buy some snake oil if you could just transfer me some money so I can access my bank account.

Still doesn't mean they are technically the same.

Not exactly a specialist, but Kraken seems like a somewhat decent alternative. Just a tiny bit more complicated and from what I can tell most of the same functionality.

My only regret is that I just converted a couple hundred Euros hours before the dip.
