Right, I don't understand the gamer hate for crypto.  It can pay for a badass gaming computer for them.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:51:30
The gamers don't lose if they just use that more expensive GPU to mine when they're not gaming...and end up with a free GPU.  These things are ROI'ing themselves in less than 6 months.

It will be needed as those "idle hands" aren't just lazy fucks as you see them...theyre people put out of work due to increases in both automation and population.  Just wait for the impact on unemployment from driverless cars / trucks, that's just the beginning if you take the long view.  
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:25:36
That's a fallacy to assume because that's how it worked in the past is how it will work in the future. New industries now are focusing on automation, AI, machine-to-machine innovations, etc...where as in the past that wasn't true. It's a paradigm shift and new industries will never create more jobs than they eliminate...it's the reality of where we are heading that is dangerous to rationalize away.

UBI can exist under the free market as layer that simply gives employees more freedom to negotiate their wages with employers than we have now (instead of over half of America playing the wage slave game).  I don't think you fully understand UBI if you're worried about people bumming out b/c they have food and shelter covered. It's a cleaner/more efficent version of a social system (vs  things like social security / food stamps / unemployment etc that we have now)....it wouldnt be a socialist form of government / society, but would allow for more entrepauneurership and innovation than we have even now as people wouldn't have to risk their very livelihood to try branching out on their own venture, doing something they enjoy instead of working multiple jobs to make ends meet.

For miners that hodl no extra USD needs to enter the market, right?  Price is determined by supply and demand yes...but if people aren't offering the mined bitcoin for sale it doesn't affect price?  Genuine question as I'm not 100% sure that's how it works...but I thought it made sense that way.
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:55:18
If that much of the hashrate leaves for 2x, can GPU miners jump into BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:36:23
masochism is a thing you know..
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:49:28
Fork the mining algorithm or switch to Vertcoin I guess.  Would love to just hodl BTC, but have to hedge at this point imo...too much drama.
@_date: 2017-07-09 20:11:15
Thanks!  Appreciate the reply and good luck to you!  My goal is to have some eggs from every reasonable basket :)
@_date: 2017-07-09 17:03:28
Do you know a good place to research the different altcoins (like vertcoin) in a nonbiased way?  Not just profitability (like the whattomine website).  I've got a couple of GPUs I'm running on nicehash, but would more like to do some independent mining to collect coins I have some belief in...theres just so many coins out there I know I've probably heard nothing about.
@_date: 2017-06-18 21:41:10
I would also like to know more.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:54:37
Am I correct that if I want to buy my first BTC and hodl, I can just buy from Coinbase with a credit card / bank account and have Coinbase generate a paper wallet for me?  So I have my own keys /  worry less about August 1st?
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:33:38
Agreed on difficulty...I'm not sure how you get to unique human signatures in a digital environment without biometrics.  However even then, with a thumb print / eye scan per mining rig, you just hire a bunch of people for peanuts to come in and scan their data.   So, even proof of multiple actors is not the target imo...that's why I feel location is key in some aspect.  Spoofing of locations can be detected...they detect it and ban people in Pokemon for it lol.
Limiting the max hash power as a % of the total for a large region would be something.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:48:42
I'd like to buy ASAP, but can't find a hardware wallet...can I buy from Coinbase and have them generate a paper wallet for me in order to hold my own keys (i.e. have both chains if there is a split)?
@_date: 2017-06-18 05:56:25
I guess I'm still just imagining a warehouse full of people" actively" mining then.  Like WoW gold farmers if you are familiar with that game...China wins again.
Perhaps there's a way to create the mining game such that speed / brute force don't give a significant advantage, and therefore reduce the barrier to entry for regular individuals?  
Is that what this guy is talking about?  was a subtweet to this threads original post:

True capitalism always leads to concentration of wealth, concentration of wealth leads in corporate hands leads to oligarchy...we have true capitalism now, it's hardly regulated compared to what it once was...see GOP.  Pure capitalism is bad...pure socialism is bad...you need something in between. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 03:11:43
Could the code be altered so that you can only mine transactions within a certain vicintity/geographic location near you?  Almost like a geocaching aspect.  Mining over VPN or spoofing would have to be eliminated.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:20:02
Is Bitstamp fine to use if you're in the US?  Or will there be additional fees since it's an EU exchange?
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:46:18
Do you know where I can buy one at a reasonable price w/o bitcoin?  Their website makes you use bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:34:58
Thanks for the help :)
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:27:50
Yup, key word there is density.  
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:13:31
Thanks for the detailed response.  It is helping my continually growing understanding...
My question originated from other r/bitcoin thread comments that suggested having BTC on Coinbase means your destiny after Aug 1st is in Coinbase's hands (i.e. decisions they make in the case of a chain split).  It sounds like that isn't the case if I take the vault option where I have control of the keys. 
My plan was to grab a Ledger to hold the BTC, but they're on backorder past Aug 1st, which is why the paper wallets interested me. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 18:31:36
I haven't seen any news to explain all of the movement happening right now.
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:38:59
Been researching making a similar rig.  Do you mind sharing what motherboard, CPU and PSU you chose?  Just a single power supply?  I thought I read on mining or nicehash sub that going single vs multiple power supply is preferable, but didn't know if that was possible with 6x or 8x 1080 TI rig.
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:44:04
Thanks, I they said it wouldn't ship until August 23rd (oof!), so I ended up getting a Trezor.

Please enlighten me as to the value these bring to the majority of human beings.

Not a big fan of Capitalism myself, it needs quite a bit of tweaking.  See wealth inequality, oligarchy, etc...
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:01:51
New here, everyone says it isn't worth it...question to everyone though...if more people mined wouldn't that help decentralize BTC further, and help prevent people like Jihan from having so much sway?  Or would no reasonable number of average joe miners make a dent?
@_date: 2017-06-18 03:14:45
You'd think we all have some sort of unique digital signature.  Perhaps by browsing history.  The CIA/FBI could probably contribute to this convo. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 18:34:57
Anyone have any idea why the sell off at this particular time, or is it always pretty random?  Whales having some fun?
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:06:50
Oh, no, I just don't have any bitcoin yet.  I guess I could...buy bitcoin on Coinbase, use that to buy the Trezor, then transfer remaining bitcoin from Coinbase to the Trezor?  Is that right?  Complete noob here...I've read the guide/FAQ, just still trying to confirm my understandings.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:50:52
How do you buy one from them without already having bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:44:17
If you plan to invest for the long-term, it doesn't matter what price you buy in at...you just hodl (hold) it until it's much higher.  
If the maximization of your investments drives you crazy, then take 50% of what you plan to invest and invest it now.  Then wait until the price moves significantly before investing the other 50%.  If goes down, great you have benefited...if not, then you have less of a lost opportunity cost.  It's a hedge.
@_date: 2017-06-23 00:57:25
Is this true if UASF is successful?  I thought part of Aug 1st was to aimed at the ASIC monopoly.

How about bitcoin users get to maintain their anonymity but bitcoin miners do not and one mining rig per identified individual.  Not sure how that would be done without tying a government I.D. / citizenship identification # / something official &amp; unique to the mining rig permissions...but hey the governments get thrown a bone to be involved.  Miners sacrifice some privacy for the greater good / decentralizion of bitcoin.
Note that I have no idea what I'm talking about.
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:07:58
lol, can't tell if you're a troll or an idiot, my friend.  Bitcoin isn't even down.

Relevant username.
Just use Bitstamp after you get verified.

Preservation of purchasing power would be the main benefit of an inflationless currency.  Hmm, I guess that particular benefit is just overblown.

Doesn't being forced into some kind of organization (e.g. pool) go against the intent of decentralization?   
@_date: 2017-06-14 04:09:27
So is now a fine time to buy some combination of bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum to hold long-term?  It sounds like I just buy a ledger...and then buy the coins somewhere and have them transferred to said ledger?  The UASF vs Segwick doesn't exactly matter to someone doing the what I just described?
@_date: 2017-06-18 02:44:14
You're the best.

Wanting to be a new Bitcoiner here...I was going to buy a Ledger Nano S but can't find any that aren't on back-order until August...Anywhere I can buy a Trezor at a reasonable price in USD?  Trezor's website forces you to use Bitcoin...which I don't have.  Any help would be awesome!

Actually just got done doing that...thank you!
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:59:04
I've thought about this more and maybe biometrics with individually capped hashrate isn't a bad solution.  Whether people pool in person or online is no different...you can never prevent the pool.  At least by requiring the human element you are decreasing the incentive to have a large farm.
@_date: 2017-06-24 00:31:24
Didn't they say the same thing about Donald Trump?  If only they were right about that...
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:38:07
Were you able to get the Ledger Nano S shipped to you soon?  Everywhere I'm looking it's on back-order...would like one ASAP, any help would be much appreciated!
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:02:00
The longer the term, the higher bitcoin's price will go.  Sure there will be dips, but simple supply vs demand means the price will go up because the supply is capped at 21,000,000 coins.
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:44:26
that's what I ended up doing, thanks!
@_date: 2017-06-18 02:53:27
Is there a way to limit mining density by IP address?  I.e. if only x amount of mining rigs could operate in a building/area in order to prevent large farms? 
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:19:48
I'm registering to all three.  Bitstamp verified the quickest, still waiting on the others.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:12:08
I thought I've been reading around here that just sticking your BTC in a hardware wallet and waiting will do the trick?
