i think your fine. even though price is currently falling, there are a lot of legit uses for bitcoin, and the asain markets woke up to huge loss but price is stable for last couple hours (morning trading time for asia), price is leveled out for the time being (maybe being the floor) but who knows.   i personally think your fine. the last thing you should do is make another decision at the moment, wait till tomorrow at least before doing anything.

not everything is so transparent.  even if theres a big initial support for coinbase and it fails in long run, all i see is there that there are a lot of peoplewho want to see bitcoin succeed.
