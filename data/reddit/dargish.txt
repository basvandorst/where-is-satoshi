£288 for 1 Bitcoin when it's £280 on Coinfloor. I get that you need to charge a fee and I'm sure 2.7% doesn't sound like much but with Coinfloor especially during their no fees phase it was ridiculously cheap to buy. Just a pity I bought before the current dip :)

Usually college dropouts or people desperate for a job that can't or don't want to for some reason or another become real policemen. Their lives then proceed to be about as pleasant as cow dung icecream until they reach the point where they lack all means of empathy and start to abuse their powers in ways that make them feel important because in reality they are working a job that is possibly one of the most pointless careers in history.

It would also avoid 70% of the potential people willing to try this. That's not even taking into account that Android is more popular among those with technical knowledge of which the Bitcoin community is predominantly made up of. I would estimate that users are probably more like 75-80% Android users.

Every exchange does this. You don't have just one address there, they just create a new one whenever needed and tie it to your account. When payments go into it they immediately get transferred out to their internal Bitcoin storage and the amount credited to your account.

Cash comes with its own costs as well as security concerns. You'd have to then take the time to first of all secure the cash in a safe on your premises and then bring the cash in a secure manner to your nearest bank branch for deposit. Not exactly saving much effort/money on credit/debit fees.

That is certainly a factor. Though not a reason to not buy online with Bitcoin, in the long term integration into stores will attract a wider user base which will boost the price. Also buying with Bitcoin has to be the most pleasant way of buying online :)

A lot of the large mining operations might be in too deep and will try to keep going until they are bankrupt. The way I see it it's a matter of which ones can keep themselves afloat financially during this downturn and which will sink. Either way we end up with less miners at the end, as you said it's got to stabilise.

For now it's converted on either end. This would persuade more businesses to join Bitcoin, if these businesses provide even a 1 or 2% discount on prices then other businesses would prefer to deal with them in Bitcoin. It's when you have furniture makers buying wood from lumberyards in Bitcoin that they made from selling their furniture that the Bitcoin ecosystem will really take off.
The financial benefit of using a protocol like the one I outlined would be lower fees than credit cards. It costs practically nothing for Coinbase to send that transaction to VoS, it's all automated. It should be much cheaper for the end user be they businesses or consumers.
@_date: 2014-09-18 10:34:20
I know it's an unpopular opinion but yes I'm afraid so.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:01:15
I'm waiting for coinbase, or a new organisation to tackle the issue of chargebacks. Granted businesses are sold the idea of Bitcoin being better for them because of no chargebacks but there is nothing to be said that chargebacks can't exist in the Bitcoin ecosystem. All we would need is a protocol on top of Bitcoin adopted by all major online wallet services that would allow for instant transfers based on trust between these services. It would also allow for chargebacks by clients funds being kept by the wallet services just like with banks today.
For example, I use Coinbase as my wallet, the store I'm buying from uses Vault of Satoshi. I agree to a payment from my Coinbase account to their VoS account. This is processed immediately and the transaction is created to be confirmed at a later that. The actual process of the transaction is of no worry to me, that's just between Coinbase and VoS.
The store I bought from reneges on their end of the deal, the product hasn't arrived months later or whatever. I contact Coinbase and request a chargeback, this could be instant or it could go into a dispute mode for both parties to argue like with Paypal. No idea what's better here but either way if successful VoS takes the money from the stores account, and sends it back to my account in Coinbase.
To achieve this we need trusted enterprises to meet and agree to the terms of this protocol and jointly develop and adopt the technology behind it. Perhaps a minimum level of security can be required, independantly evaluated by existing members before a new organisation can sign up to the protocol. Now users have some peace of when dealing with online entities, if they are part of the "Bitcoin Transfer Protocol" then you know now only that your transactions will be quick, chargebacks will be available but you also know that they are secure and their details are registered in case of fraud on their part.
Now many will argue that this is move away from the open free market of Bitcoin but it is just an optional layer on top, personal transactions will of course still be available, the "BTP" is just there as a peace of mind for new users and new businesses.
I fully believe that Bitcoin cannot get to the moon without a system such as this in place. It is similar to current banking methods and so will be recognisable and trustworthy for new businesses and new users.

what was wrong with titcoin? I mean really.
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:10:05
Bank transfers cannot easily be reversed. I would imagine you would have to try and prove to your bank that it was fraudulent and not performed by you. Do you have a case where this occurred? 
Localbitcoins operate an escrow service to avoid exactly what you described with not receiving the Bitcoins. A dispute would have to be filed by the seller to retrieve his Bitcoins from escrow at which point it would be simple for the buyer to provide proof that the transaction did occur. 
Not sure if you're just imagining what might go wrong or if you actually know of cases where it has, if so please link me to them. I know plenty of people that have used localbitcoins regularly without issue. For further peace of mind there is also the trust system in place for leaving feedback, a fraudster would quickly be identified.

Just saw this in an email from them. Very disappointing, they had become by far the easiest way to buy Bitcoin in the UK and I was enjoying using their platform. We can only hope that they find another UK based bank willing to partner with them.

I'm talking about actual users of Bitcoin, people who have never owned any before and buy some to spend in online stores to take advantage of a discount, or people that use it to send home to another country. All of that is buying pressure that will build the more users there are.
Hopefully they don't spend everything they buy straight away, if you're going to buy a laptop maybe you'd buy 2 BTC but only spend 1.5 and keep the rest for another time.
@_date: 2014-09-18 11:38:33
Yes but as this chart shows the rate at this is happening is increasing dramatically. Miners are finding it more and more difficult to stay afloat and are thus willing to sell their mined coins and any reserves they had even under the break even threshold.
@_date: 2014-10-15 13:40:54
Luckily I only had around 0.2BTC worth of coins left on the site. I'd pretty much given up crypto trading. Still quite shocking though as before their "Upgrade" they had been the best exchange out there in my opinion. I don't know why they felt they had to upgrade to what was in every way a worse website.
Just another reason to move everything I own to cold storage asap I guess.
@_date: 2014-09-18 09:21:41
This means that more mining companies are buying more mining equipment for fiat and paying more for electricity in fiat and are thus selling most if not all the coins they mine for fiat in order to cover this.
This would explain the downturn in price lately, at some point there will be a balance but I strongly believe that at the moment the market is run by miners.
What this also means however is that the next price bubble will be phenomenally explosive. I don't know what the catalyst will be but as soon as the price rises above the break even threshold for miners they will no longer need to sell every coin and many will start to hold as they hope for an even better price in the future, this will result in less coins being sold on the market and the price rising further and further.
When and how this bubble will come about I won't even attempt to guess at.

If a node has exhausted all connections it will now prioritise based on a given set of rules. One of these rules is that connections from known tor exit nodes (publicly available list) are given a lower priority as DDOS attacks have been shown to be launched through Tor for obvious reasons.
I am not taking a side in this ridiculous schism but as an experienced programmer I've looked through the changes listed, read the reasons given and can see no underhandedness at all. Just a load of scaremongering by code illiterates. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 15:32:12
It seems that the tool used to read the list of tor exit addresses should be run manually to generate a file that can then be used by the node. Presumably most node operators won't do this that regularly so it's not like an automated process that can't just be not done if an issue arises.
It seems literally like just a tiny helper parser script that is optionally run by the node operator if they want to.
@_date: 2015-08-20 15:34:18
It's not blacklisting, those connections will be accepted at all times unless the node is completely full of connections with higher priorities.
And noone is mapping tor, you make it sound like it will affect the anonymity of tor which is absolutely not true. It just uses this publicly available information:
@_date: 2015-08-20 12:55:00
Oh ffs the misinformation in this thread is mind boggling. No it cannot blacklist people. It prioritises based on a known open source list of rules. As Tor nodes are known to be avenues of DDOS attacks on the network they are given a lower priority. This will only ever matter if all nodes on the network are completely maxed out in connections which will only ever happen during a DDOS attack which likely will come through the Tor network.
There is no secret blacklist of people and there never will be so long as the client is open source.
@_date: 2015-08-20 12:50:10
I really don't understand how so many people can't grasp exactly what you're saying. The code does nothing bad, it will actually improve the stability of the network when under DDOS attacks which will only increase as the network matures and the existing powers react.

The overall product of humanity can be measured in terms of energy, see the [Kardashev scale]( The source of the energy is not important, its use towards improving humanities situation is. Is the energy use of Bitcoin worthwhile when it could be spent on something else? Or in reducing the amount of carbon being burnt by other countries by selling the energy of your country abroad?

Really? Do you think that entertainment serves no purpose? Would you rather live in a society with nothing to do when you want to relax? I'm starting to doubt your rationality when it comes to this discussion.
As for choosing how you want to spend energy, I'm not arguing against that, I don't know how you construed that from anything I said. I'm merely asking **why** Bitcoin is using so much energy, it doesn't need to. It's the equivalent to saying don't leave your oven on all day just to cook chips when you get home. Sure it's your choice, if you want to waste energy then go for it, but why?

Like he said you can patent anything. The US Patent office probably won't do an in depth search for prior art, especially not in the technology sector. What will happen is that theythey will be given the patent,then if another company uses or is using the same idea the onus will be on coinbase to pay to take them to court. At that point if prior art exists then it will be simple for the defense to prove it and the patent will be nullified. 
Coinbase knows this and so will only challenge other companies over truly innovative ideas that they are patenting.

I'm quite happy with how I started, bar the timing which meant I bought at an average of over £600 (now at £420). I bought chunks of £50 or £100 up to a fixed total of £500 which I'd set aside to invest. I bought at relative dips in the price on localbitcoins which seems to be the easiest if you're in england.
Now, unless it drops quite a lot further I will probably just hold and hope it goes up in the future. It is tempting to invest more at the current price but the drop from when I initially invested has put me off somewhat.
If you can, pick a figure you're willing to invest, a figure you can deal with losing and invest it at the best price you can taking into account exchange fees. Afterwards just put it somewhere secure and walk away. Try not to get addicted to checking the price like I have or You'll be tempted to invest more than you can lose.

If it goes down to $10 I'm putting another $500 into it immediately! Then atleast I'll have 50.78 bitcoins!

I missed out on a decent localbitcoins sale in the UK because I went for a cup of tea while debating it. Price had jumped up £30 when I got back. It really is difficult to time this right, I thought it might keep dropping so didn't buy straight away.

To think, what was once $10 of bitcoins can now take you to space.
