I realize that you're trying to get the word out, in case there's a real problem here.
But I assume that you want your money back too? 
Their support and other posters here are correct that if you have 11 words, you should definitely be able to recover the 12th.
If I remember correctly the seedrecover.py script uses whatever words you have, in combination with any receive address you might have to try to recover the original seed. Depending on how accurate and complete your information is, it can definitely be done in a reasonable amount of time. 
In my case, it only took a couple of minutes to recover the missing word from my son's seed.
I recommend the btcrecover toolset over that web site that BRD support suggested. I would never trust a web site running on a server not under my control to recover my seed.
@_date: 2018-05-26 20:56:03
This happened to my son about a year ago. I just figured he lost a word while writing it down.
I was able to recover his wallet using the btcrecover toolset. Take a look at the seedrecover.py script.
You might want to run it from a Linux VM, which you can destroy after recovering the seed.

The block hash is performed twice. The first intermediary hash feeds into the second actual hash.
It's unclear to me if the current 50 exahash estimate counts both or not. If not, and if you wanted to store the intermediary hash as well as the final one then we're talking about 64 bytes stored per block solve attempt.
@_date: 2017-02-20 16:35:13
Agreed. But a 50% difference is a lot less than 300%. Just wanted to clear that part up. 
The Bitmain S9 wins on efficiency, but the horrible failure rate makes it a crap shoot. The Avalon 721 and 741 are arguably better models, but they cost more and take more power.
No matter how you slice it, today's offerings are risky. It's too bad there isn't real competition in the ASIC market.

@_date: 2017-03-29 13:36:57
Even better, make a product that competes with Bitmain's S9. Currently the only competing model is the Avalon 741, and its price is too high to seriously compete.
@_date: 2017-02-20 15:45:21
You're comparing against an old Avalon model. The Avalon 721 was available at the end of last year.
1000watt/6000Gh/s --&gt; 0.16Gh/s
Sure the S9 still has better efficiency. But not as big a margin as you indicated.
Also, there have been lots of reliability problems with the S9. Avalon seems to have a better reputation for reliability.

Isn't Antpool one of the biggest offenders for mining empty blocks? Clearly the majority of their revenue is from the block reward. Fees are an afterthought, and only included when  convenient to their mining strategy.
Sure eventually the fees are supposed to replace the block reward, but that is many many years out. If we see insane off chain scaling in the meantime, there should still be healthy fees for miners (as per the OP).
Given the above, why so much urgency with BU now?

Sensible or not, it's worth understanding that Dell can screw up and not deliver through no fault of your own and the result is effectively a forced exchange to the fiat value at the time of purchase. Also, if my son's personal experience is typical, you won't see your refund money for weeks or months.
Every person who uses Bitcoin to buy from Dell takes on this risk. The same probably hold true for most big companies that use a payment processor and take their payment in dollars.
@_date: 2017-01-15 15:51:17
If you do a regular search for restaurants (or whatever), then append this to the URL, you'll only see businesses that accept bitcoin:
There's probably an easier way to do this. It's not clear to me how the OP got that "Accepts bitcoin" checkbox to show up in the Yelp GUI.
Also, who knows if the info Yelp has on file is accurate regarding Bitcoin acceptance.
@_date: 2017-01-18 01:13:30
This. 
My son got pretty badly screwed over because Dell couldn't deliver what he bought. He still doesn't have his refund check and it's been 6 weeks. Bitcoin has gone up quite a bit during that time.
He has nothing to show for his honest attempt to buy something from Dell except the hard lesson that they are a terrible company to work with when things go wrong.

Why not use Trezor's coin splitting tool to send your Bcash to an exchange? You're probably better off selling it than holding it anyway. 
To do that though you may have to update the firmware on your Trezor. That might be risky if you don't have the seed.
I think there's a version of Electrum that supports Bcash and Trezor. But I have no experience with it. You might want to look into it to see if you can send your Bcash somewhere without a firmware update. I'm not clear if that's safe or not because you need to be sure that any spend of Bcash is protected against a replay attack. If that feature is part of the firmware update, then you're kind of stuck.
Probably a good idea to run this past Trezor support and come up with the best plan.
In any case, if you get to the point where you can send your Bcash somewhere, do not send it to a Bitcoin address. You will lose your Bcash if you do that. I've seen too many posts where people have ignored the warning from the Trezor coin splitter and sent their Bcash into oblivion.

Bittrex has an AutoSell option, if you don't want to keep watching and waiting for confirmations. It's under the Lab tab.
Personally I'm regretting not sending at some of my BTC to hitbtc.com. I would have beat some of the rush due to their low confirmation requirement.
@_date: 2017-01-18 05:28:52
It's interesting how people on this sub assume the worst of other people. You are at least the third person who has accused me of being greedy without knowing anything about me.
You are wrong. All that I (and my son) wanted was the amount of BTC that was spent.
In an ideal world where the seller doesn't perform, the sale should be undone with no harm to the innocent buyer. I realize that is not how it works in reality where none of these big sellers really give a crap about Bitcoin. It's just a gimmick sold to them by payment processors like Coinbase who have every interest in selling their services and no interest in consumer protection.
@_date: 2017-01-15 21:38:41
You've got the time line wrong and are making assumptions that are not true. It took Dell weeks to even respond about a refund. In theory they sent the refund on the first week of January. We can't confirm that because they were inflexible about the return address so my son can't even access the check until he's back at school this week.
If Dell had their act together they would not have offered an item that they didn't have in stock. Further they should have processed the refund right away, then perhaps my son would be in a position to repurchase Bitcoin without too much of a loss.
As it is my son has been out the money for nearly six weeks. He a student and doesn't have much money.
If the price had dropped, my son (and myself) would have the same expectation. Getting back exactly the amount of Bitcoin used to make the purchase in the first place.
The main points here are that Dell is a terrible company to work with when things go badly, and that Coinbase has no customer protections against their bad behavior, as far as I can tell.

I use a Trezor for the majority of my savings. I have a separate unopened Trezor at another location as an emergency backup.
I rarely use the Trezor for purchases. Instead I have a few hundred dollars worth on Breadwallet on my phone. The combination of a Trezor for savings and Breadwallet for spending works well.
Note that Trezor is working on their second generation product. They're trying to ship in Q2 2017.
@_date: 2017-01-18 15:18:06
I'm not sure why it's up to me to explain how refunding in Bitcoin should work. I don't have that answer.
All I know is that as things are now, the seller is free to misbehave (intentionally or through incompetence) and the risk is 100% on the buyer.
In my son's case, Dell didn't have the item to sell and wasn't going to be able to deliver it for months (if ever). They fraudulently offered the item for sale, and my son got stuck holding the bag.
They still haven't even provided the refund check in dollars and it's been six weeks.
Does anyone else think it's OK for there to be no protections for buyers using Bitcoin? Because that's the way it is now.

I plan to use SegWit for any transaction with lots of inputs. I've got a Trezor that has accounts with lots of small mining payouts. 
Sending a transaction with a crapload of inputs signed on a dinky little processor like the Trezor has takes forever. I've had some transfers take upwards of 20 minutes due to all the signing operations. 
It can get so bad that I've had to develop a strategy of periodically consolidating my accounts so that I can pick the time when I can wait, rather than being forced to wait at some inopportune time.
So call me selfish if you want, but I plan to use SegWit to save time, as it was intended for my use case.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:07:45
My limited understanding is that Segwit allows hardware devices to perform fewer signature operations. So a transaction with a lot of inputs can be signed in seconds instead of minutes.
@_date: 2017-01-09 16:59:53
As I understand it, voting for core on Slush is an implicit vote for Segwit. Slush allows voting by blockchain proposal, not by individual feature.
As far as a 100% Segwit pool is concerned, I think that ck's solo pool is Segwit now. But then you'd be solo mining, which might not be what you want.
Things may be imperfect on now because of miner apathy. But I think that having voting choices is at least better than no choice at all.
The main reason why I left Kano's pool is that he's an outspoken critic of Segwit. He even went so far as to update his pool software while removing the Segwit code. While I love the profitability of Kano's pool, I really disagree with him on Segwit.

So they didn't alert their users via email. You have to find out about it by logging in.
I tried to change my password, and it kept giving me an unhelpful "password error". Clearly I know my password because I can log in. Tried a bunch of different new passwords on the theory that there are some characters that they don't support (and don't tell you about). In the end I somehow got locked out of my account.
Tried to recover my password to work around these bugs, and their site sent me an email with an empty password reset token.
They take incompetence to a new level...
Oh well, I guess hackers can have my account. I'm not doing any business with Bitmain any more anyway.
@_date: 2017-01-15 22:34:05
You took out the part where I indicated that Coinbase has no customer protection in place. 
With other non-Bitcoin payment processors, the money would not be sent until the order had been processed. Clearly Dell didn't even have the item in stock and could not process the order, so in an ideal world they should not have received payment for it. But I understand now that Coinbase isn't solving the escrow problem. They're getting fiat into their merchants' pockets as quickly as possible to reduce their currency fluctuation risk.
Regardless of whether you think Bitcoin refunds make sense, the fact remains that my son entered into a purchase with optimism and the best intentions, and through no fault of his own has been out the money for six weeks. He has nothing to show for this except lost opportunity and a hard lesson.
This experience will make both of us think twice about future Bitcoin purchases from larger companies. Certainly I won't buy from Dell again, and am angry at Coinbase for enabling their bad behavior.

I used to like Trezor’s fee estimation, but lately it seems to be lowballing. The bitcoin.fees.earn.com always seems high, but they’re about estimating the fastest and cheapest fees. I almost never need to value confirmation time that high.

Very impressive sleuthing! Thanks so much for this. It's game changing info.
Obviously the "major manufacture" ([sic], should be "manufacturer") is Bitmain. So in addition to a technical approach to this problem proposed here, there's a potential legal angle because they've clearly infringed on the ASICBOOST patent. 
Sure they're in China largely out of reach legally. But if the patent was issued in the US, then it's at least possible to get an injunction to block Bitmain sales to the US. That would open up the US market to Canaan Creative (or BitFury if they ever get off their collective butt and make mining hardware available to the public again).
While I'm not a big fan of patent enforcement, it might be worth considering it as a tool to introduce more competition and decentralization in the mining world.
Do the ASICBOOST patent holders plan to enforce their patent? If they don't have the cash, maybe there's a GoFundMe (or similar service) opportunity?

I'm also doing DCA, but through BitWage. I've configured a certain percentage of my paycheck to be sent to them. They automatically transfer it to my hardware wallet address.
The purchase price always seems high through them though. I've been thinking about switching to a Coinbase scheduled buy, but then I have to remember to transfer it out of Coinbase to my hardware wallet.
So far laziness has won and I've stuck with BitWage.
I've been tracking my progress with Google sheets because it's pretty easy to add some Java scripting that automatically gets the total received by a bitcoin address. So effectively the spreadsheet automatically updates. Also, Google supports automatically getting the exchange rate for BTC to dollars.
I started doing all this in January 2016. So 17 months later, I'm up 187%.

It worked for Litecoin. SegWit was dead in the water until Charlie Lee effectively struck the same deal for Litecoin as the original Bitcoin Hong Kong Agreement. The miners agreed and Litecoin has SegWit now.
The fact that this worked on Litecoin is a clear signal from the miners. Returning to the original agreement would allow the miners to regain face, which is important to them.
Let's learn from Litecoin, return to the original Hong Kong Agreement, and move forward.

I'm really looking forward to this. Segwit allows hardware wallets to sign transactions quickly, even if there are many inputs.
I'm a hobbyist miner so I have a ton of small payments to my Trezor managed keys. Sometimes I consolidate mining revenue so that I can minimize signing time when I buy something. I've seen the signing portion of the consolidation process take tens of minutes.
Ideally we'd have this on Bitcoin. But I also use Litecoin, so I'll take what I can get.

Kano has been anti-segwit from the beginning. That's why I stopped mining on his pool.
But I've seen no indication that he's connected in any way with Bitmain. There's been lots of hatred for Bitmain on Kano's thread in the past, especially when it comes to empty blocks. 
Kano prides himself on his high performance pool and its ability to deliver full blocks with low latency, while criticizing other pools (especially AntPool) for their crappy engineering and bad practices.
While I think he's wrong about segwit, I do think that Kano is his own man. It's possible to disagree with segwit and not be Bitmain's pawn.

This BCC "feature" will allow any pool to reap short term benefits from mining tons Bitcoin Cash blocks, before the inevitable BCC price crash. Then when these miners come back to the main BTC chain, they can enjoy the side benefit of a period of adjusted lower difficulty (assuming enough hash power follows this strategy).

So this is like the Etherium fork. People hold Etherium classic, but there's nothing you can really do with it other than speculate. I can see Bitcoin Cash heading down the same path.
