dag is the only scalable architecture. untested but the dags have way more upside than blockchains

lol the delusion is real

the reason is that you can buy BTC with a credit card instantly. coinbase/GDAX deposits take multiple days
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:51:29
surely you don't understand my point..?
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:00:54
was interest in bitcoin not speculation when it was younger?
@_date: 2017-03-19 05:39:24
don't think that's necessarily true, all prices are forward-looking. people know that the supply will dry up. if your theory were true and many people accepted it, price would go up well before the halving.
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:01:31
@_date: 2017-04-03 17:57:42
so because development news is not highly correlated with price, price will increase?
@_date: 2017-04-03 17:14:58
can you explain why you think the price will stay propped up so high despite no scalability solution in the near future coupled with a potential hard fork?

two points:
1. bitcoin uses ecdsa, not rsa
2. schorr's algo can be used to break ecdsa, with a powerful enough quantum computer of course. this is estimated to require about [2330 qubits]( as a frame of reference, the most in any current quantum computer implementation is 72.

i am bullish on crypto, but i can guarantee that btc returns in the next 4 years will be less than they were in the past 4 years. past returns do not predict future returns
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:12:02


i don't disagree but you could say this about virtually any investment
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:49:09
sykkk bro, i'll take u seriously when u provide evidence that btc has "the greatest potential ROI of all time" lmao
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:33:04
i never said anything about segwit. it was a plan for btc all along, says more about ltc being a testnet for btc than btc's ability to capture the advantages of alts. nevertheless, showing one instance of your argument being true does not prove your argument that "bitcoin can take anything good on board," i hope you know that.
now, when i make the point that bitcoin will never be anonymous, that is showing an instance where your argument that "btc can take anything good on board" does not hold. didn't think i'd have to spell it out for you.
you can say what you want about new mining pools being developed but until there are no mining pools with absurd hashrates (&gt;~5%) bitcoin will be considerably centralized.
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:04:07
lol anything can happen in the short term, like people buying bitcoin before a hard fork because they assume the sum of the forked coins will be worth more than the whole. 
i'm all about the long run personally.
RemindMe! 2 years "what is btc dominance?"
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:27:55
i guess you think stronger means higher price?
look at the technology. bitcoin is a dinosaur compared to the tech of some altcoins. eth the "shitcoin" routinely outpaces bitcoin in terms of transaction volume with less tx fees and quicker transactions. not to mention it is capable of much more than being sent from one person to another.
network effect is the only advantage bitcoin has, give the alts a few years to catch up and we'll see what crypto looks like.
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:19:32


any stock, property, or cryptocurrency technically has unlimited upside, with a maximum downside of 100% of the initial investment. that is a fact. lol


i would say ether, iota, and/or monero have significantly greater ROI potential, but this is my personal opinion. if any cryptocurrency, however, overtakes bitcoin's market cap (or even half of it) it will have provided a greater ROI than bitcoin.
given that there are several cryptocurrencies with significantly better tech than bitcoin i would say that it is very likely one of them will provide greater returns.
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:54:40
again you think stronger means higher price but seems i can't convince you otherwise. btc does not have the ability to take "anything good" on board, i can't believe you actually think that. btc will never be anonymous and will always have fees. as long as btc uses pow and electricity is cheap in china, mining will continue to be centralized.
fyi, i own both btc and eth and have more gains from holding eth in the past year than i would have gotten in 3 years of holding btc...
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:57:10
are you just looking at pyethereum on github to see the number of contributors? clearly there are other repos and seems like you're picking one arbitrarily which doesn't accurately portray the number of eth devs.
also note that bitcoin has been around for ~9 years while ethereum has barely been around for two, meaning that btc has had more time to let that github contributor number rise
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:09:57
its short term when you compare it to a 4 year downtrend... best of luck with your retirement lol
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:54:28
i see a lot of people complain about ethereum's inflation. you do know it will decay exponentially, right? by the time inflation plays a significant part in the price of eth, inflation will essentially be zero.
and of course, the main utility of eth is to be used in smart contracts on the evm. but to each his own
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:04:45
clearly you don't understand that there were several different points in these comments. i agree with some and disagree with others.
obviously "guarantee" was an overstatement, but i think i got my point across. if there were no counterparty risk or opportunity cost of making that bet with mcafee, i would. if you truly think btc will be trading at $500,000 within 3 years you should be margin long.
if you want to put money on your stance of eth being a "shitcoin," why not short the eth/btc ratio? easy money if you're right. i know i'll be doing the opposite.
the very fact that you think eth is a shitcoin is laughable, seems anything other than btc is a shitcoin. perhaps approaching other technology with an open mind will give you better investment opportunities. remind me in 3 years whether btc has provided higher returns than eth (or iota or xmr for that matter).
the only real advantage bitcoin has is its network effect, and it is starting to lose that. btc dominance is near historic lows and i don't see that trend reversing anytime soon. i've seen the adoption curve argument countless times but it means nothing if money flows into other cryptos. 
who knows, maybe if you stop dismissing people who disagree with you as idiots you may make better decisions!

what if... the bitcoin etf tracks the bitcoin index...
just like... gold etfs track the gold index...
and... volatility etfs track the volatility index...
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:22:38
only relevant dev figure is the number of current devs, not the number of devs ever. i would imagine that a greater portion of the ethereum github contributors are active relative to that of bitcoin simply because the bitcoin github is older.
regardless, my main point is that you cannot look at the number of contributors on github (let alone a single repo) and determine the number of active devs. 
bitcoin does have some advantages over ethereum but i would not cite a developer advantage as one of its strongest.
never said ethereum is "better" but when a network routinely has more transaction volume, quicker transactions, and lower fees than the premier cryptocurrency, you start to question which one can fit the currency mold better...
@_date: 2017-05-14 06:18:12
looks like trade volume to me
@_date: 2017-05-14 06:07:49
first of all in the $1 and $1.02 example the spread would be 2 cents. and secondly a candle is green if the close is higher than the open in that period while red means the opposite (to give a more exact explanation).
