Here are my list of questions. It might be worth you adding them in:
1. What is the rollout plan for seg wit?
1. Does the use of anyonecanspend mean that if miners break rules, then they can spend it? What if they just say that they are implementing it, but actually don’t so that the 95% trigger is activated, then they sweep up any seg wit transactions?
1. How does a non-upgraded wallet know a segwit transaction is valid? 
1. What exactly happens if/when 95% hash power is reached in a soft fork?
1. Does seg wit itself allow script versions or is it the anyone-can-spend trick that allows this?
1. Can seg wit be introduced as a hard fork without breaking hardware wallets etc?

I disagree. When Adam said 'soft fork', I assumed that he means BIP9 style transition (i.e. 95% consensus on the new rule). What I think you are saying is he actually meant was a situation where 50+% of miners start rejecting the other miner's blocks.
Is this correct? Doesn't it sound just a little bit dangerous to you?
@_date: 2016-04-13 11:24:07

Take a 10 pound note out of your pocket and say 'this is bitcoin'. You can use it to buy goods and services. Anything you can do with this note, you can now do with bitcoin.
How does it work?
Some very clever people have found a way to establish who holds this 10 pound note and prove that they own it.
What are wallets and how were the defendants able to 'take' peoples' coins?
If I put this note in half my pocket and thieves see that I have it and I do not secure my pocket, then thieves can take it from me.
How were they able to 'cash out'?
This note has a serial number on it, but that does not stop me from handing it over to someone else, without them realising that the serial number belongs to a note that was stolen.

Which roadmap do you mean when you say 'this roadmap'? The 'core' one or the HK roundtable agreement one? I read 'this roadmap' as the HK roundtable agreement one i.e. fork to 2MB after segwit.


Which roadmap do you mean when you say 'their agreed upon roadmap'? The 'core' one or the HK roundtable agreement one? I also read 'this roadmap' as the HK roundtable agreement one, because otherwise it made no sense. Of course 'core' are following their roadmap. Why is that relevant to the HK agreement?

If you look at all the "empty blocks", you can see that the block was found less than a minute after the previous one. In this case the incentive is for the miner to publish the block rather than spend time preparing a full block.

* u/hellobitcoinworld is probably the most controversial[1] of the large blockists and I notice that of all the large blockists he has the most downvotes.

Sorry I'm still confused. Maybe it's better if I restate the question.
If I don't upgrade (let's assume for idealogical reasons) and receive a segwit transaction, what are my possible scenarios. Dr Lau said that "It just cannot happen.", but I think that's just a communication issue. From what I understand, it can happen and the receiving wallet sees an 'anyone-can-spend' transaction, that bizarrely (to that wallet) has not been spent (even though it may see confirmations). Now (assuming segwit has been activated and all miners are now processing segwit), from my non-upgraded wallet could I try to spend the segwit/anyone-can-spend transaction to another address that I control? Then if I get confirmations could I assume that the original segwit transaction is valid?
@_date: 2016-03-26 08:15:51
Who is [sending you to Coventry?](
@_date: 2016-03-31 20:43:28
OK, let's assume that segwit is adopted and all future transactions have their signature segregated.
Then witness data is in it's own block, but not part of the chain. 
What links the chains together is the hash of the previous block being included in the new block. The hash of the previous block will not have any witness data in it, so therefore the witness is not part of the blockchain. Please let me know what I have wrong.

Please note that this is an important debate to have. You obviously have your defined ideas about what bitcoin is. However, Bitcoin was created to avoid central authorities and 'appeals to authority' like yours do it no favor. 


Again I'm asking about the theoretical situation where bitcoin.org has to produce software that hard forks. All bitcoin nodes would then have to choose which fork to follow, consensus be damned.
@_date: 2016-06-10 20:45:00
Upvoted because I didn't understand a single sentence, but it sounded good.
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:33:14


So if every node except one accepts the consensus changes, that means the one is still running bitcoin and everyone else is running an alt?
...and remember we are talking about a situation where a hard fork is required because otherwise no blocks will be produced.
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:50:09
No. Just a neutral onlooker.
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:09:14

@_date: 2017-08-26 10:05:03


Honest question? Would it then be Bitcoin? It would not be the longest chain. It would not have the most hash power. What is to then distinguish it as Bitcoin from all the other forks?
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:49:03
ahhh the economy. Like bitpay and the exchanges right? Gotcha, that clears it up.
@_date: 2017-08-27 07:42:00


except not call it "bitcoin".
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:17:37
I felt that by you making the current output bitcoin.org somehow special that you are appealing to the authority of the 'bitcoin developers' or at the very least those who control bitcoin.org. It seems that you agree that 'bitcoin.org' could be 'sacked', in which case I was wrong.
Given we are well down the tree of hypothetical situations I'll leave it here.
@_date: 2017-08-28 03:33:45


Which Bitcoin developers? You are appealing to their authority. This is a circular argument: if 'bitcoin' is defined by 'bitcoin' developers, then who defines who is a bitcoin developer? If you have defined a bitcoin developer, then you are appealing to that centralised authority. 
Aren't there five constituencies of consensus (developers, miners, exchanges, wallets/users, and merchant services). What is it in your opinion that makes the developers special?
@_date: 2017-08-27 05:46:28
Can you explain that? Of course nodes run by miners, exchanges, bitpay etc. will define bitcoin. But most nodes are just noise. Virtually anyone can run a node as a hobby/fully validating wallet, but they would be irrelevant. Just as many nodes could spring up supporting any fork. How do they define bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-27 05:58:18
Where did I supply any information? I'm certainly not ignorant of any of this, but I am curious to see what happens IF the exchanges and bitpay support 2x as Bitcoin, how entrenched some sections of the community are going to be. I also got some great responses to my question. 
It's also an interesting debate about what "bitcoin" is and how that definition is changing over time. I'm hodling both btc and bch, so I can claim to be relatively impartial. I would of course be against anything that threatens the utility or price of my holdings.
@_date: 2017-08-28 02:44:50


Well of course. You are powerless as well.


No we don't have that power either, because If we run a node which isn't following 'bitcoin consensus' we ain't securing our 'bitcoin'.
My question is what is 'bitcoin consensus' once everyone has been forced to hard fork? You haven't answered that. u/trillian answered that by appealing to bitcoin.org's authority, but I'm not happy with 'appeals to authority'.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:40:46

With bip38 the password does not have to be that complex as it hard to brute force. It should not be guessable though. Print out the encrypted private key on the printer, then write the password on it. This is just as good as an unencrypted private key, but the printer cannot steal it.

Willybot was his bot and it bought high and sold low, making huge losses. Without this activity mtGox would have stopped trading a lot earlier and saved a lot of money. One thing I do not get is that MK moved 4 million bitcoin under his control after the hack to prove the exchange was still solvent. Was it solvent at that point or not?

Hey. Lay off Santa.
@_date: 2017-07-11 13:36:00
Sorry, I should have been clearer. What wasn't known is whether willybot was internal or a hacker.
Willybot bought over 250,000 bitcoin in the months before the collapse, of course it was the cause of the price run up.
@_date: 2017-07-12 00:05:41
Willy was a thing and it could have been an inside job or (however implausible) someone who had hacked into the exchange. We now are beginning to get confirmation that it was an inside job. Essentially Willy bought high and sold low, which (now it has been confirmed as an inside job) seems to suggest mt Gox (and thus it's creditors) lost a huge amount of 'money' due to this bot.

End every answer with ", just like cash."
What is bitcoin?
It's a coin which can be exchanged for goods and services. Just like cash.
How can I spend bitcoin?
There is an app for it. Once installed, you simply need to use your phone to take a picture of a barcode and enter in the amount to send. Better than cash!
How can I get bitcoin?
Your app can produce a picture barcode which people who want to send you money can scan.
Can someone steal my bitcoin?
Yes just like cash. Unfortunately it is one if bitcoin's biggest problems. Fortunately just like your house you can lock it up. Unfortunately just like your house your locks can be picked.
Can I loose my bitcoin?
Yes, just like cash.

More helpful answer:
Lets say that my small bitcoin investment makes me rich beyond the dreams of averice. Suddenly there is a database that tracks my identity and my home address to those riches. 
Let us now suppose that this database is leaked to the public domain. Unlikely, I know, that a government or government backed agency could possibly lose such valuable secrets (good job there is no precedent).
Now even if I have a memorised brainwallet address, criminals could kidnap my wife and extort those funds from me.
Now I have just scared myself shitless. I might have to start mixing my coins if the price keeps going up.
