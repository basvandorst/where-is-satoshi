Coinbase is corrupt. People should learn that here.

r/btc is the FoxNews of bitcoin and r/bitcoin is the CNN. They dislike each other and both contain propaganda. Get used to it or tune out.

Someone put a lot of money into this ad.. Look how professional. These guys are for real.

Gdax announced they'd be opening the BCH floodgates tomorrow.. Somehow I think they'll delay that with another convenient 'crash'

Coinbase is corrupt. Insider trading and market manipulation are among the red flags. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:24:40
Coinbase is corrupt. It's obvious to anybody who's been paying attention. Not every glitch is due to corruption, but get out of there either way.

Coinbase is corrupt. A big fish that thinks it can be an asshole. But it's little pond will grow. The rains are coming and there will be bigger fish. And hungry. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:59:52
I'm betting many BCH devotees assume GDAX/Coinbase allowed BCH-BTC trading on day 1. The fact that they didn't should scare them all to death. And the reason they didn't.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:10:53
It becomes currency when you want to spend it. I don't want to spend it and I don't understand why others do. And fees have nothing to do with it. Fiat sits in the bank and does nothing. Spend that. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:06:45
Ha! No fudding at all.. You should take everything you've got and short bitcoin. Nobody's stopping you.

A letter punch set is cheap on Amazon. A flat steel bracket is a couple bucks at any hardware store. Borrow a hammer and make as many copies as you want. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:26:05
People, including Ver and friends, use BCH to get more BTC. That’s what it’s for. Pump and dump for bitcoin. BCH can’t get above 0.21 for that reason. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:27:26
Coinbase reminds me of AOL back in the day. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:04:00
Count yourself lucky. Coinbase is corrupt. Money laundering is just the start. Red flags all over the place
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:52:34
Coinbase is corrupt. Red flags all over the place. Insider trading etc. Hold off and use other exchanges until Coinbase is inevitably replaced by something more trustworthy
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:09:10
Trade your BCH for BTC on the next pump. BCH is highly manipulated, Ver and friends will pump it again (unless he decides to pump another fork like his original S2X plan, which would kill BCH) BCH will dump hard again at 0.2 BTC so watch it. Or don't and blame the outcome on your friend.

True. The first cow was sold for 3 goats and to this day, goats are legal tender.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:34:55
Coinbase is extremely corrupt. They have an advantageous position early in a growing industry and feel emboldened to commit all sorts of fraud and market manipulation. Insider trading is just the tip of the iceberg. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:34:59
They have another year or two of market manipulation and insider trading before they are replaced by better and more trustworthy options. Avoid

Corrupt. Bad is a judgement call.

Crashed. Too many people trying to dump their bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:01:28
This is going to be ugly for BCH. And Coinbase.
They are big but not a monopoly. Fuck em.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:27:03
Patience, watch for a pump. BCH is highly manipulated. Trade BCH for BTC during the pump. Wait for BCH to settle and buy it back low. Patience, watch for a pump. BCH is highly manipulated.

Watch the market. Be patient, it goes down. Buy the dip. Watch the market. Be patient, it goes up. Hodl. Watch the market. Be patient, it goes down. Buy the dip.

I predict a desperate pump before Jan 1, and a massive dump after. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:14:15
They support Bcash and are attempting to delay the inevitable incoming mass dump-a-thon.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:06:26
The herd.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:25:06
Tether, dragonslayer, segwit2x death spiral.. Every week there's a new threat that r/btc believes will bring down bitcoin and make bcash skyrocket. There will be a new thing next week. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:53:16
There's about to be a massive BCH dump. Whoosh!!!
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:06:44
Or wait a year and you have a $500 video game. I wouldn't be buying stuff at an ATH though, hoping for a drop. I don't know, you could be right but I just want more BTC. Spending it now doesn't interest me. Eventually it might. I see Bitcoin as an early motorcar dealing with a lot of shitty horse trails. Soon there will be more roads. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:46:38
I’ll be a cheapskate and spend the difference on bitcoin. It’s a significant difference. Doesn’t have to be pretty, it’s in a safe. Just needs to survive fire, flood etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:46:03
Be patient, it goes up. Watch the market. Be patient, it goes down. Buy the dip. Be patient, it goes up. Watch the market. Be patient, it goes down. Buy the dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:54:31
I know. If you're new, this seems worrying. It's fine. It's common. Buy the dip or you'll regret it later. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:56:33
Massive bcash dump incoming.. Nothing could be more obvious but hey, good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:06:55
Coinbase won't allow the dump. I'm sure their customers will be fine with it..
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:06:21
I feel for them. They're being flimflammed and bled dry. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:50:53
Many of those who want to spend bitcoin, have to spend bitcoin because they’re overextended. I don’t want to spend bitcoin and fees have nothing to do with it. I’ve had the option and chose not to every time, because I’d rather spend fiat. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:07:51
January 1 2018. The worst day ever for r/btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:24:14
Coinsquare seems to work alright. This whole industry is in its infancy though. Before long there will be intense competition everywhere in the space. I imagine an Amazon cryptomarketplace with no fees (for prime members) and discounts for merchandise purchased through your Amazon wallet. Stuff like that. Coinbase/GDax, QCX etc. will all improve or be predictably crushed. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:29:33
They won't let it die naturally, hence the manipulation. Might as well take advantage of the pump and join in on the dump. BCH is made for dumping. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:35:16
They’re pumping it again hoping to make people think twice Jan 1. However nobody is fooled anymore by the flippening and it shall be a merry New Years dumpening for bch. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:19:10
A hammer. A cheap letter punch set from anywhere (amazon etc.). A sheet of steel. Save yourself a LOT of money. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:11:18
I would agree, but zoom all the way out on the GDax chart and tell me where are the sellers?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:27:58
This and past shenanigans reveal the manipulation involved with bcash. Coinbase is obviously implicit as well. People can do what they want with their money, but there are red flags all over the place. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:22:15
Many, perhaps not most. Probably because I don't have to re-buy fiat after. The price may change between the purchase and re-buy of bitcoin. But really, it's a split-second decision. Buy it with bitcoin? ..Nah. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:53:54
I'm still waiting for 0.18 to dump BCH for BTC. That way I'm even. Should have never believed the fud. r/btc is the fox news of bitcoin and Bcash/Ver is their Trump
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:56:29
Today's 'crash' wasn't a rush to buy... Some will want to buy BCH as a hedge, but that won't dent the innumerable free coins that will be gleefully dumped. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:20:12
Yes, but this is global. It would be nice if one of the competitive big future exchanges was Canadian, but I'm not counting on it. The big guys will probably be American, based offshore somewhere, paying fuck all for taxes. Part of why they'll crush the rest. Still, they will make the most sense for the masses to use. Not just for fees, but companies like Amazon offer a certain comfort level, security and legitimacy. Plus they do hire plenty of Canadians.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:28:59
BCH will plummet as soon as Coinbase releases it. Prepare for another mysterious crash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:39:13
Obvious market manipulation. BCH will plummet. Coinbase will face a TON of angry customers. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:56:33
They can do what they want but I'm canceling my Coinbase account. Doubt I'm the only one. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:11:36
Market manipulation. It won't stop. Trade BCH now for +0.2 BTC. Wait for the inevitable drop. Buy BCH at the non-pump level of - 0.1 BTC. Wait for the next pump. Use their shitcoin pumps to get more bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:53:38
A letter punch set is $15. A flat steel bracket is $2. You could buy an $87 hammer to use only for this and still come out on top. Imagine if you already own a hammer.. And you can make multiple copies. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:46:24
The answer is obvious. They will be crushed by competition in the next few years. Just avoid them. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:50:52
Must be new around here.. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 21:20:23
Only BTC. And that shit ver coin is a great pump vehicle. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:13:21
R/BTC is the FoxNews of Bitcoin. Right down to the unscrupulous figurehead/daddy. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 03:33:58
He's the king. The grand wizard. The only one that matters. His first choice was S2X and he settled for BCH. For now. I assume he uses it to get more BTC like everyone with a brain. BCH is a predictable pump and dump coin manipulated by a few bad actors. It's best use is to get more BTC during these coordinated pumps. Like doge. If doge had an inferiority complex and an identity crisis. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 04:39:05
I never said it's a scam. It's an Elvis impersonator who actually thinks he's Elvis. That's not a scam as much as a disease. It's sad. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 23:04:24
Haha right. Never mind the obvious centralization, corrupt Coinbase rollout and unscrupulous figurehead. Keep believing in fairytales. That flippening is imminent... hilarious. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 21:31:10
It is. Buy that garbage at sub 0.1 and sell around 0.15. Hard dump before 0.2 every time. Even after the recent long desperate sustained pump. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:30:26
He did make it though. Immediately after S2X failed, it was pan B...CH. Without Ver bitcoin cash dies. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:18:00
With pride. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 18:10:06
That coin is great. Predictably manipulated by a few bad actors and each pump is inflamed by hundreds of mouth breathing morons believing a ridiculously foolish flippening fantasy. There is no better way to get free BTC. Pump and dump baby. Keep em' coming. Nothing to whine about. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 19:11:00
This should be on every exchange. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 23:58:08
Haha yes it does and no need to name him. He jumps ship and it’s all over. And his first choice was S2X. He settled for your coin (for now) but now it doesn’t even reach 0.2 after a huge pump. Pathetic performance but I’m sure there will never be another coin for the king to play with. Never. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 00:47:25
It technically existed before his initial pump immediately following his failed S2X. But he MADE BCH. Without him it’s nothing. He jumps ship it’s all over. Not a stable situation. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:35:52
They will start to care.. but too late. Arrogant Coinbase/Gdax will be replaced. A cheaper and easier to use alternative (or many) will pop up and crush them. I picture Amazon or somebody launching a crypto marketplace with no fees and incentives that will be hard to compete with. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:09:08
Too expensive. I just bought a letter punch set from amazon to stamp a sheet of stainless steel. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:17:28
Me too! Selling now. I'm also selling all my Transformers for Go-Bots.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:27:30
I'm new and want to hedge my bets but after that garbage over the weekend, I'd feel dirty buying a certain alt. Good job to those who managed to dump their free ones that I was too late to get. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:32:07
A letter punch set from amazon for $10 and any piece of metal 
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:35:13
Is it possible coinbase decides to do the same?
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:39:21
Invest only what you can lose. It's as speculative as it is spectacular and not for the faint of heart. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:47:52

@_date: 2018-02-04 03:27:17
It’s theCNN and FoxNews of Bitcoin. Both biased but one has an unscrupulous king they worship. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:57:47
An impersonator in a bad wig and a cheap jumpsuit parading around calling itself the king. It’s as pathetic as it is sad. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 08:11:59
Artificial pump immediately after S2X failed. BCH is highly manipulated. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:23:29
There is one bitcoin, and one bitcoin impersonator in a bad wig and a cheap jumpsuit that parades around calling itself the king. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:41:44
Coinbase is corrupt. Red flags everywhere. Insider trading is just the start. Their early dominance will be corroded by their criminal behavior and stupidity. Good riddance. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:32:37
Worst one day dip ever. But I’m sure it will go straight back up from here...

You created a fork. It’s called bitcoin cash. Yes, it stinks but don’t worry. It’s getting flushed. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:20:18
Cant lose if you’re loose. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:56:02
It's a pump. BCH fell so far this seems big. It was 0.14 BTC on day 1, the day of the fork. It's 0.16 now after days of furious pumping. Pathetic
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:06:19
It's going to be more popular? It's performance has been pathetic despite the pumps. BCH was 0.14 on day 1. Have a look  at where it's at now. Talk about it all you want. It's shit. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 08:03:32
Buy a letter punch set on Amazon for $13. Find any piece of sheet metal or steel.
