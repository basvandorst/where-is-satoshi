A rober killed a rich kid parents, then they fell to a data server company cave, and was attacked by a lot of bits, he overcame his trauma and became bitman, Lord of the net.
@_date: 2019-07-27 13:22:56
Good, so I can buy again.
@_date: 2019-07-23 18:16:36
I want to down vote you, but last time my dad wanted to buy, Bitcoin fell to 3000 from 18000, so can't argue even if I want.

i´m an advertiser, trying to do business.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:12:50
because is the most stable... 
you can laught now, no problemo.
i will invest in some other too, monero and etherium, but right now i have no extra money for that.
[Edit] Also i want to accept payments in bitcoin in my marketing agency (and any other crypto i can trade) But not sure how to do that. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:17:56
i hope this is why all my money in blockchain wallet is gone, and it be there when they come back.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:01:15
Hold it till xmass, I think this will scalate a lot and then a heavy correction, and then a high again but normalized, maybe around 15.000 to January.
Don't take my statement as true or something just my guess.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:11:43
You can giftme a bitcoin anytime you want :)

In Chile Is not legal. Not ilegal.
But there will be legislation... In the future, far far in the future, because Chile...
However, you can use, you can buy, exange, etc. But banks will hate you... A lot.

Maduro es un hijo de puta!
Sorry for that, but is true.
Also i`m not venezuelan, i´m chilean, but i know how a dictatorchip is.
@_date: 2018-09-05 18:11:53
That is not socialism to be honest. Is a bunch of people with weapons and greed taking the power, and a Nation to coward to do something about it.
A dictator, no matter the colour of his flag is just a dictator.
I can tell you, because I'm Chilean. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:29:15
Yeah a socialist flag. My point is that doesn't matter. Dictator is a dictator whatever the flag is.
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:41:14
For about 20 seconds. Stabilized enough.
@_date: 2018-08-13 00:38:21
Can somebody explain me this please? I'm not in the USA, and I was under a rock for the last 7 months or so. So I have no idea what is the deal about this.
@_date: 2018-08-03 20:49:24
Microsoft Bitcoin? Please no.
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:03:42
Still confused. 
@_date: 2019-03-06 11:18:05
I don't have the answer for that. 
@_date: 2019-03-05 18:30:22
Any one see the problem in crypto? 
As I see it, crypto is only for rich people [insert argument: but you can buy as many as you can and hodl] 
I think the way how crypto is distributed now will just make a bigger hole between classes, rich people more rich and poor people don't even knowing what's going on.
The real revolution will start when crypto and blockchain has a "Ford T" crypto. 
@_date: 2019-03-05 19:43:01
Mm... I understand that, and I agree in that point, but still I have that concern, because if only the actual wealthy can access to crypto, then when blockchain and crypto coins become a thing of every day, then the non wealthy will be out of system, and that will be another problem, and a big one because the number of people out of the system.
@_date: 2019-11-14 11:51:59
Go, do it.
@_date: 2019-03-06 11:25:02
Because of access to information for that segment of people is not the same. Education is worst for the poor, and lack of interest because a lot of reasons.
Yeah the problem indeed is much bigger, but I just wanted to speak my mind about that, and you have a good point, maybe I'm looking it in the wrong direction and is not the crypto but the wallet that is need to be improved. Making a wallet as easy to use as Facebook could be the right direction.
@_date: 2018-10-28 20:59:15
Jajajajajaja yo corrigiendo y voy y la cago.
Tenía la duda, gracias. ;)
@_date: 2018-10-28 18:25:23
Are you a gringo? Friendly reminder is written cerveza, with Z.
If you are Mexican then escribe bien ctm.
@_date: 2019-03-05 19:35:41
I don't know, maybe it doesn't exist. I'm looking for answers. 
I don't think Bitcoin (or any crypto right now) is the answer. The answer might be in blockchain, or not.
@_date: 2018-10-28 18:27:05
Bitcoin, es un anglisismo^anglicismo^anglicismo^anglicismo y se dice igual en cualquier idioma. Como taxi es taxi en cualquier idioma, y como champagne es espumante ah no, ese no.
@_date: 2019-08-28 05:14:35
Remember to sell at 56.000
@_date: 2019-08-12 14:38:30
Oh, hi Greg, nice to see you again. How are you doing?
@_date: 2019-08-18 16:22:48
Time to buy then?
@_date: 2019-06-14 22:25:02
Literally a conversation I had today with a client. Her son loves crypto, and she understands what it is, but the husband can't comprehend and think is a scam. Jaja.
Edit: I messed with genders. Ups.
@_date: 2019-06-19 17:01:03
I think Libra could harm more than help.
A lot of scammed people will regret buying libra, and will blame cryptos equally. Not just their ignorance.
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:25:14
I'm ok with the drop, I want to buy more.
@_date: 2019-06-17 01:33:25
I challenge you to a fart competition. I'm the best farter!!
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:36:17
Jajaja I didn't sell at 3000, but had to use some satoshis because needed a hosting and was ruined economically.
@_date: 2019-06-20 11:11:25
Is worst than I thought then.
This smell like anti tax coin. Well I need to read the papper after all. Now I want to know why this exist.
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:17:27
Jaja i bought at 18000 xD
I was an idiot but whatever.
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:05:50
I saw some comments and thought this people can't really think the QR is the art.
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:35:07
Hodl hodl.
I had to use some satoshis and bought again when had some money. But lost a lot, anyway not worried for how much I lost, money comes and goes.
@_date: 2019-12-25 22:32:22
The is time for an ipfs YouTube~ish platform that work with crypto, or even bat.
@_date: 2019-04-20 13:13:43
I bought a hosting service a year ago because I had no single dolar at that moment, and felt bad, really bad. (bc it wasn't a good service, and bought those sato at bigger price)
@_date: 2018-11-07 01:31:57
So it can defeat Vegeta.
@_date: 2019-01-03 13:49:17
What the point of no one is using it?
Hodl is ok, but it needs to be used. Hodl and trading will mantain it as a niche toy for ever...
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:55:34
Blockchain Is much more. Bitcoin is a currency with technological advantages over traditional money.
@_date: 2019-09-05 15:45:48
Try that Jesus!
@_date: 2019-09-06 03:36:24
So there is Satoshi!
@_date: 2019-09-05 15:49:30
Don't think of it like a fast win. Bitcoin will become THE reserve for a lot of people, and you need to invest in a few Satoshi Everytime you can. And wait.
For daily use (and not exactly now) buy Litecoin or dash. 
I'm buying Bitcoin when I can, is my retirement reserve.
@_date: 2019-09-29 16:18:07
I'm not that optimistic. I think they will use for their own purposes, and if we are helped or fucked in the process will be just a collateral.
@_date: 2019-09-05 15:45:54
Try that, Jesus!
@_date: 2019-05-10 14:29:30
How can I download the video to use in my social media?
@_date: 2019-05-18 18:52:58
Nascar Is so boring, they can make two laps without crashing.
But yeah a very popular sport in just one country. It might work.
@_date: 2019-05-10 13:42:08
Ey don't be harsh to the gringo, their bombs are made of democracy!
@_date: 2019-05-10 13:40:57
And infested other countries.
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:26:42
If you have crypto, buy for your mom and transfer to her wallet.
She don't need to do the transactions if you can do that, that bank will never trace her wallet because is imposible for them.
If you can't for whatever reason take the Fiat then use PayPal, or any other virtual card service that is not based in your country.
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:39:42
No man, I'm telling the opposite, USA used that power against other countries, if they get out of the loop by dropping crypto and loose control I'm totally ok with that geopolitical scenario.
It will be good for thirth world countries.
@_date: 2019-05-21 18:42:19
I don't know the laws in the USA, but in my country this might be useless.
At least here you can register a brand and prohibit anyone else to use it in a certain field. But you can't register the brand "money" to make a Bank. 
If you want to register an IP you need to prove it as original, and authority. This might be imposible in the Bitcoin paper, because is clear no one can prove as the author of the paper, not blockchain.
Also, I know this is different in the USA, but no one can patent software here.
International laws about brands patents and IP are similar In most countries so similarities could exist for this.
@_date: 2019-05-15 02:25:49
Hahahaha, sorry, I don't believe it.
@_date: 2019-05-10 13:43:12
That sound as a good idea to me. Im in.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:04:23
@_date: 2019-05-21 18:34:29
I have a serious question. Who is paying this guy? His reclamation is stupid, so I figured someone else should be behind all this waste of time for a certain goal.
This is no more than public relations to distract people.
No one can be so stupid without a clear objective.
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:23:23
You must try to help with not being an asshole. Just saying.
