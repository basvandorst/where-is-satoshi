No new is backed by China. There is a difference between Bitcoins decentralization and the Neo platform. Neo complies with all Chinese laws despite being stationed in Singapore.

I went ahead and edited it with the correct format. Give it a read if you wish!

Sending $5000 in to a company and them not accept it and not respond to any calls, emails, or messages. And I had to spam them because there "automated system" puts you on hold, then instantly hangs up. They do not update the customer to as little as "yes we received your money. I think you're wrong, if they had a person talk to me this would be fixed in 5 minutes...

The initial plan was to send via BTC, but after seeing the forums, some people had problems with BTC transactions and wanted to have the security of my Bank vs. Their bank essentially. I would rather fill out a few forms saying I sent the money then have the transaction get lost on their end. Looking back on it, I have come to the conclusion that I will be paying in LTC. Still, This should stop Bitmain from even offering USD wires. Infact, read this link, It even says at the bottom "6. USD wires are accepted for this batch" : link ---&gt; 
I should have included this in the article. May edit soon
