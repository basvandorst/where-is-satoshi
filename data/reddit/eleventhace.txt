They said they're never going to sell BTC, but what about BCH? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:27:48
And 4 years later at 100k, someone is going to say they heard about bitcoin at 14k and could have been a millionaire.

Can we stop the fake negative sounding title click baits

Im confused, is a dollar worth of ripple cheaper than a dollar worth of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:23:21
I was being conservative rather than assuming the same % gain.
Still, at 100k a 700% gain would still trigger the same responses. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 05:09:43
The fact that they’re so invested means the price can’t fall too much, surely it will be a good trading opportunity if it keeps falling. They have to prop it up eventually
@_date: 2018-08-03 02:36:00
The only time I think about BCH is when someone here mentions it. If you ignore it, it will go away...like most other altcoins.

Jordan Belfort says zero. That’s less likely than even mcafees prediction

The liquidity is low enough it would take only a few million to add hundreds of millions to the market cap, and allow them to sell some of the fomo. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 09:22:28
You’re acting like it’s still a threat.

someone needs to make a fork of bitcoin and call it bitcoin core, then he cant call bitcoin "bitcoin core"

Dont forget to set your low ball buy orders for the ProShares ETF denial scheduled for the 24th. Shorts ATH on finex. This market is too easy. Bears desperate for sub 5k, lets see if it holds up.

Or people who can afford to take the risk.

If he believes the price will rise in the future then buying more now will reduce his break even price.

It's too late, there's no more bitcoin for sale. 
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:32:36
“High” is subjective.
Is 100k high? If btc goes to 100k the entire market cap is still only a fraction of gold.
@_date: 2019-10-27 03:41:24
Probably for the inverse reason that fiat continues to lose value.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:39:41
At 4K on r/all the sentiment of the comments were all “I missed the boat”. I said it’s not too late, no one said this was the top and got downvoted for shilling. Hope that puts things into perspective for anyone still wondering whether to buy or not.
@_date: 2017-04-08 06:42:30
It will, just search on twitter for people making other price predictions and then post them here likes it's a fact. 
@_date: 2019-04-11 07:43:28
Mining fees will exist for 100+ years, by then the hashrate would be a bit higher than 10x.
@_date: 2017-04-08 06:40:59
r/bitcoin is now a twitter feed. Also opinion tweets are relevant content here now? 
@_date: 2019-04-09 08:18:10
There was major resistance at 5k. Sell orders are dynamic and don’t mean much.
@_date: 2019-04-23 05:16:32
You’d be right, if it was 2013. Now you’re embarrassingly wrong
@_date: 2018-11-10 10:01:45
His prediction holds some weight as his previous 10k prediction came true while everyone thought he was crazy at the time and ridiculed him. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:55:37
Most of the sellers would have made a profit, it’s still way up compared to last feb. I can’t see why they wouldn’t buy back in, you can’t get these potential returns in any other markets. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:22:13
If you’re happy with the value then you think it’s overpriced
@_date: 2018-02-14 10:43:31
Someone should make a fork called bitcoin core to avoid this
@_date: 2017-09-19 08:26:07
If anyone was dumb enough to sell due to his comments they deserve to take a loss. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:20:15
Is the money going out, or is it waiting on the sidelines to come back in? I think the majority of sellers are waiting to buy back in and if most of them have this mentality the market cap will eventually rise back to where it was. The money doesn’t just disappear. 
@_date: 2015-10-28 08:41:59
Except youtube who would get 2 cents in bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-10-28 06:36:49
Op is talking about 2 cent transactions, I'm sure your payments were higher than this. If you send 2 cents to someone via PayPal, the other person isn't getting anything.
@_date: 2015-10-27 21:42:23
Micropayments are not feasible with traditional payment methods due to their fee structures
@_date: 2015-10-21 05:31:15
Only 48 hours? I had my 4 btc in limbo for 12 days, they didnt respond to any of my ticket requests for a week or so but they eventually processed my withdrawal. 
@_date: 2015-10-05 06:37:43
They kicked ass against crypsty in may too, and we know how that went 
Also again in 2014
@_date: 2015-10-29 10:20:56
Micropayments are a legitimate advantage that bitcoin has over traditional payment models, I don’t see how this is blind faith or even that im implying it would have any impact on the price of bitcoin or that you should invest in it. I never mentioned getting rich as the price of bitcoin does not matter in this instance, it’s a simple use case that applies to your original quote ‘The criteria MUST be that it only really works with Bitcoin above other payment methods’, which it does.

Luxury brands actually did even better in the last recession than compared to before the recession.

We're not talking about monthly subscriptions, we're talking about microtransactions. Not everyone wants to pay $10 a month when they only plan to use a service one time.
If you run a blog and want to charge a micropayment of 2 cents to view your entire article, are you going to use bitcoin or paypal or any other existing platform?

Buy redd then convert it to btc

“No name” Greyscale are managing over 2B AUM.

Compared to the total market cap of crypto 2B is significant.
