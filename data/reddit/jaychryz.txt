Congrats! That's exactly how I started with $100, It changed my life.
Dont invest what you can't afford to lose, be patient, ask lots of questions here on Reddit and you should do very well :)

Coinbase is a great place to start, but fees are a bit higher and limits are low without ID. Other exchanges that do not require ID for basic trading are Kraken, Binance, Bittex, Bitfinex, HitBTC.  
Funding your account with fiat is another small challenge. What country do you live in?

I guess Bitcoin can help you get everything else in the photo :)

I've used Bittrex, Binance and Bitfinex. I found them all to be similar platforms to Kraken but faster without all the technical problems. There's quite a bit of discussion about Bitfinex relationship with Tether that makes a lot of people nervous. I've also tried HitBTC and found it good but a bit higher learning curve for beginners. 
There are many more exchanges out there too. I personally have never experienced Kraken's technical problems anywhere else. 
I also spread my "trading" crypto out quite a bit so if one exchange ever goes down (like Mt Gox) I don't lose it all.

You recommended Kraken but I had a lot of trouble with the site. Over half of the time, I logged in or tried to do any type of transaction I would receive an error. This went on for months until I finally moved my funds to another exchange. Luckily it was only a small amount but it still was very irritating. If you search you will see a lot of people had the same experience. Hopefully, the will get it all fixed but i don't think I would go back. :(
