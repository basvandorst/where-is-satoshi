1) completely pointless. getting around such restrictions would be trivially easy and just inconveniences legitimate vpn/tor users.
2) and 3) maybe you could have this as an optional account setting, but I don't think many people will want these.. I certainly don't want to have to make withdrawls 24hrs in advance.

There are millions of open proxies that aren't on any ban lists.. it's easy to use one - even through tor. You could buy a vps with bitcoin or prepaid visa/mastercard and jump through that..  you could use someone's open wifi or a prepaid 3g simcard. Blocking tor isn't going to stop hackers and it will inconvenience people who want to use it to access their own accounts.. maybe a better idea would be to allow people to specifically nominate IPs that are permitted to access their account. Even that may not help much since the withdraw may come from their own trojaned pc, but it's better than a banlist.
I wouldn't really want any arbitrary delay on my own withdrawls.. but I guess if it's optional then I guess that could be ok. I suspect a lot of people will still get really angry when they discover they won't be able to buy something though.

"held a one-day conference which examined how Bitcoin works" "The meeting, entitled *The Future of Money*"
"Also under consideration was the idea of creating a regulated exchange, which would be the world’s first. "
