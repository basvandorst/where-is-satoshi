The waiters will think of you just like they thought of that person who left a Bible quote as a tip.  Do not do this unless you want to be thought of as an asshole.

Economics is not math, it is about human behavior.

I once had 115 BTC bought mostly under $10.  I gave some away to friends to get them into it, bought socks, lost some in SatoshiDICE, and kept over a hundred.  I sold 80% of them in the 20s and low 30s, because I needed money and thinking there was no way a spike like that was sustainable.  THANK THE STARS I kept 20-odd.   I'm in those for the long haul.

Seriously. What about all the people here who have been predicting total economic global collapse since as long as I've been paying attention?  Sure there's crashes, recessions, etc. but we're nowhere near mad max levels yet nor will we be.  
In the 1980s, foreign debt defaults were going to cause hyperinflation and collapse.  In the 1990s it was the "new world order" or some shit, then Y2k.  Then it was the "Asian Flu", then the real estate bubble, then the bank bailouts, then peak oil, then the fucking mayan calendar, and on and on.  Year after doomsaying year and nobody ever gets called on it.  They just calmly move to the next apocalyptic scenario. THAT'S bullshit.

A prolonged MtGox outage or hack will pop this bubble like nothing else.

Good points all.

I ordered one in August 2012 for $150.  If I had put the money into Bitcoins I'd have had $2500 at the peak boom, still $1200.  Much more profitable than mining would ever be.
By the time these machines are out, the difficulty will be so high that they'll be boat anchors.

Looks great! Can you add CampBX.com at some point? :)

LOL assuming the police are going to swoop in and arrest everyone. Sorry, until hundreds of thousands are being exchanged nobody will give a shit.  The police have better things to do, like stop and frisk racial minorities.

Here is what you should do immediately - sell off enough to cover your initial stake and even a modest profit (say 10%).  Now you are playing with the house money - even if it all goes away you are still fine. And if it goes up so much the better. You didn't lose your initial stake and anything you make from now on is gravy.  That is the best stress cure I  know of.

I am also a graphic designer by trade.  I plan to make the deck look rad. :)

My tech talk a week ago went quite well!  It was only an hour so I didn't dive too deep into the underpinnings, and people were a little too interested in things like Silk road.  
And now around work I'm "the bitcoin guy".  :3
I have a video screencast of it on the internal server, I'll see if I can put it up someplace.  It's a little more rambling than I might want to distribute though.

It's true - getting btc converted back to USD is a pain in the ass, while using it to buy a camera or a gold coin or whatever is pretty straightforward.

Hang onto them.  
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:15:11
Yeah, that's probably the best.  It is a techie audience but even still.

Don't worry about taxes until you cash out, and then you pay a tax based on the capital gains.  If you keep your BTC then the IRS doesn't care. The amount you paid for the BTC is important, so hopefully you have that information.   You should talk to a financial advisor if you're selling any significant (more than a couple thousand bucks) amount of BTC.  I would imagine the expense of bitcoin mining would involve the computer equipment you used to do the mining but I would really talk to a tax accountant.

A few months ago I bought alpaca socks and they cost me 4 bitcoins.  They ended up being the most expensive piece of clothing I own.  I will think twice before buying anything with BTC again.  That's deflation and no it's not good for an economy.

You can sail against Peter "Paypal" Thiel's seastead and sink it.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:57:36
To be fair, they are excellent socks.

Even then, just hang on to them.

I kind of think that the 'bitcoin' name and decimal point is a problem.  It makes people think that a single BTC is the basic unit of the currency.  It's more like an ounce of gold.

Bitfloor is currently the easiest and fastest way to purchase Bitcoins via cash deposit.  You need to take a trip to the bank but it's a quick operation.

I just bought around 5 btc on CampBX, the transaction was smooth and painless, Dwolla is really the gating factor as I have to wait days to transfer money into Dwolla.  But there's no hacky cash deposits at the bank and the 25 cent fee is reasonable.
