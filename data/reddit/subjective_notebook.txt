moolah_ you are such a liar.  you stated explicitly in your blog the following:
***There is a (now leaked) confidential video, in which myself and Landon Merrill (our COO) are told that unless we provide passports and personal property records*** then this particular prominent member “will do what he needs to do”.  
You said that **IN THAT LEAKED VIDEO YOU ARE ASKED FOR PASSPORTS &amp; PROPERTY RECORDS**, but we have all seen the video and see that NO SUCH DEMAND was made of you or Landon.  So now you change your story that it was done outside of the video. You've gotta get your lies straight. 
The full video can be seen on

you know what they say: "if it ain't in writing then it didn't happen".  I guess you got your legal advice from u/sporklin. Is she still impersonating a lawyer?

just checked and the FULL video is there, it's no longer edited.  
**It is comedy gold, cuz you're the ass-clown staring in it.**

saw the video and saw this liar say that he had not intentions of raising money through another "PIE".  He reassured the foundation members that he had not intentions of doing it, but according to the Daily Dot article, this liar did another round and raised 92 Bitcoins. I guess this is what the title of the article for the video meant.

If you are one of the first to demand a refund of your investment, you MIGHT be lucky to recoup it as he will want to demonstrate that he is not a ponzi and that he is solvent and will refund you your investment.  BUT, if you wait till everyone starts asking for their money back, then you'll be out of luck.  Good luck.

no, no.  (bobing head like a 3 year old girl) YOU are harassing the **CEO** of a company.  he says it like being a **CEO** is tantamount to being the Pope.

Where are the ATM's he's supposed to have shipped out over a week ago?
@_date: 2014-07-08 01:17:25
personal information???? that's the business registration for MOOLAH.IO INC. Is that "private" info when it can easily be found on the Wyoming Secretary of State's website. As the **"CEO"**, shouldn't you have know this already?

twisting your words to fit your lies.  doing what you always do I see.
@_date: 2014-07-08 01:03:34
Folks, didn't moolah explicitly state in that video that he had no intentions to do another round of PIE investment?????? 
I'm reading in the Daily Dot article that he did a 4th round are raised about 92 Bitcoins?

top article has the video

Saw the leaked video and read your replies.  You're saying that there are no lies in the video, but according to you yourself there is at least 1 lie.  You said that you lied about Landon recording the conversation because if he were really doing that he would be committing a crime in the state of Washington. So the title of the video isn't incorrect based on your own statement.  
Either way the truth about everything will come out once you take everyone to court.  Hopefully the case is brought to an Amercian court because there's this great thing called the discovery process where everyone's laundry will get aired. So all those accusations that your real name isn't actually Alex Green will finally get put to rest.  Also, Landon will testify under oath that he didn't record the conversation.  
More important for the investors will be the cost associated with the suit.  You mentioned in the video that you couldn't confirm the audit because it would cost investors money and that according to you and Landon is illegal in the UK and the US.  
While bringing a suit doesn't deviate from good business practices, I'm curious as to what it will cost your investors in total to bring a multiple jurisdictional issue case to trial.

That's nice. Now where are those ATM's you said that you'd be shipping out? Rumor is that you didn't ship any of them?
@_date: 2014-07-13 00:48:52


I don't want to sound mean, but is that the right thing to do?  You're selling because you're fearful that something isn't right. So why would you have someone else take on 2x the loss. Yes, maybe they should know better by now and not buy it from you, but knowing what you know now, why not just ask for your money back?
@_date: 2014-07-08 00:30:22
normally u/moolah would be all over your post trying to get you to stay quiet by doing everything possible.  It's interesting that he's letting this one slide. hmmmmmmmm.  
Also didn't he promise an extra $100 in addition to the full refund. An obvious attempt to get people to request a refund instead of the actual machine, which apparently doesn't exist.

It's the top article.

Tell us what charity.  You're full of it. I guess you didn't color it a **"particular color"** when you dyed it orange in another video which was earlier than this video. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 18:04:43


It's only been like 3 or so months late.  So I'm not sure how much more time is needed.  
It seems that the ATM does not exist or he'd be defending the delivery rather than defending the accusation of him being fat.

Hi Starlightbreaker,
The full video is up on the site again.  It seems to be hosted by them and not on youtube (can't be taken down).

**Aussiehash.**  
The 750 BTC's were gathered by Moolah through something called PIE's.  It's actually about 844 Bitcoins now because he recently did another round.  Here's how Moolah raised those coins -----&gt;.  
 








































The problem with these "PIE's" is that they violate US SEC rules and regulations and as such are against US Federal law. Moolah/Alex Green claims that his company meets certain exemptions, he cannot even provide proof that he filed for these exemptions.
As you've seen from the Skype video though, Alex Green makes up laws, so maybe he created something where he's just exemption from US Federal law because he says so. 
Ask Alex Green where the ATM machines are.  The ones he promised to deliver back in March of 2014.  Ask him to send a simply picture of one.  He won't be able to since they don't exist.  He took $550 from people and promised them a machine. A machine that never existed and to this day still doesn't exist.  Alex Green is a scammer, but unlike before, we now now what his face looks like.
@_date: 2014-07-08 01:26:22
LoL. okay.  I'll take your advice on seeking professional help, but I'm not certain if I'd be doing the right thing, since on your own volition, you've stated that you suffer from a psychological disorder yourself which prevents you from showing your face (which isn't a problem anymore, LMAO) because you're afraid. But thanks for the advice though. LMAO.

This is a better site for the video 
There needs to be a few things straightened out.  You DON'T know that his name is Alex Green.  Here's why.
An Alex Green is listed as the Director of Moopay LTD in the UK, but you have no way of knowing whether or not the person with the orange hair in the Skype video is named Alex Green.  He's saying it, but refuses to provide any proof.  Is there proof that the person in the video is the same person that incorporated Moopay LTD in the UK?  NO!  
A common technique used by scammers is to have "nominees". They get a homeless person or drunk  and use that person to create a corporation.  The scammer then uses a power of attorney document to control the corporation (bank accounts, et.) that the nominee (homeless/drunk) is the Director/CEO of.  So let's say that the oranged hair guy in the video didn't use fraudulent documents to create Moopay LTD in the UK, but instead used a nominee (homeless/drunk), can you say for certain that the oranged hair guy is in fact the same person listed as the Director on the incorporation papers.  Remember he refused to show his face to the public and claimed that he couldn't show his face because he suffers from social anxiety.  And a request by the Foundation members for verification of his identity was met with legal threats against them.  
**TL:DR** 
Can you prove that the oranged hair guy claiming to be Alex Green in the leaked Skype video is actually someone named Alex Green simply because he says so?  If you can, please explain.
