If you currently have a lot of inputs, consolidate them into a single output which you own. Set a fee of 5 sat/byte and it may go through in 2 weeks or get dropped.

What's the latest on schnorr? I haven't seen much since the idea was floated. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:07:08
Segwit separates the witness part of the transaction from the rest of the transaction. By doing this the transaction size gets smaller. 
Fees are paid in satoshi's per byte. By having a smaller transaction size your fee is less. 
While not it's primary function, using segwit means more transactions in blocks and less fees. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:02:30
Do the coloured bands indicate a different level of fee? Why is grey so large? And does this chart indicate Coinbase are responsible for about 10% of the transaction volume? 
It's interesting seeing since the outage the transaction volume slowly going down. I wonder if Coinbase had their outage longer the mempool would clear, or would that be wishful thinking. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:45:16
A batch transaction for all withdrawals at a set interval will take a lot of unnecessary data off the block chain. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:53:45
Once Segwit was available it took them less than 2 weeks to implement it. This shows you their commitment to the protocol. We need exchanges to work with bitcoin and not just be available to profit off it. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:16:47
Unless they took that into account and is assuming it'll be confirmed in the next 2 blocks.

@_date: 2018-01-30 06:38:07
If it's dropping due to less volume then that's just normal right? It would be something to celebrate if we had cheap transactions with a lot of people transacting on it. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:30:57
Deffinitely, when I've taken BTC out they use enormous block chain fees, which in turn increases the fees for everybody else.

Odd that it's still there. I had a transaction get dropped by the mempool after 2 weeks and resubmitted at a higher fee. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:06:05
Had a small amount of BTC on Bitfinex which I moved off today. When you do this they have a box you tick which states you are aware that small transactions slow down the network for everybody. Kind of ironic how they are using legacy addresses and not segwit. 
However I'm grateful they are batching transactions.

Great post and after reading this, I've asked 2 exchanges I use in Australia to support transaction batching and Segwit. 
They are: 
Great exchanges, and I feel adding these enhancements will improve the overall experience. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 08:04:27
Yep. Then when you decide to move them it'll actually be advantageous to move them to segwit first, then send them to the next user (hopefully on segwit). 
However. If every new generated address is a segwit address only moving forward. Eventually as BTC moves around it will reduce bloat on the blockchain.

I run a full node. How are upgrades deployed. If you run Core are you expected to download it yourself and update? I'm asking because could there be full nodes out there which simply don't update and could cause issues on the network?

@_date: 2018-01-04 08:17:45
Exactly. This is a real wallet. Hopefully it does segwit by default for new wallets. If it doesn't. Enable it in the settings and you can untick "receive change to like type outputs" to ensure you're only using segwit addresses. 
Samourai can also set custom fees. So use RBF and if you are sending to another address you own and it's low priority just do a 30 sat/byte fee

If you're interested in BTC and have an interest in the technology a 5 sat/byte transaction is essentially nothing to help greater segwit adoption, which will in turn help the rest of the network. 
In the future if you make multiple transactions having sent these from a segwit address will result in less fees overall.

Ah thanks for the tip. Actually I've had a transaction dropped from the mempool, it's good to know the coins are returned. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:04:12
It'll be good if there was some sort of database to help create a network. Like if I have 1 BTC and was willing to create 100 channels of 0.01 BTC then I could easily find nodes to do that. 
I imagine keeping a node up 24/7 would use far less data transfer than seeding a Linux distribution on bit torrent. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:54:13
If your moving it off and exchange it's not in a wallet. You are at mercy of the exchange. The exchange could do an rbf. 
If it doesn't eventually go through it'll be dropped from the mempool and you'll have the coins on the sending address still.

I've also noticed bitaddress.org doesn't generate segwit addresses. I'm doubtful whether anybody uses this anymore though seeing as hardware wallets are cheaper and more secure. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:30:18
I gifted someone around $5 of BTC years ago and was umming and arrring whether to keep a copy of the private key. I decided against it to eliminate the temptation of a future me stealing the funds. 
Low and behold, they lost the private key and it's worth over $100 now. 
I'm more disappointed that they didn't keep the key secure despite my explicit instructions. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:14:55
Whoa overpaid. If your transaction was low priority and you could wait a few days 30 sat/byte would've been more than enough (like $1). 
If I send from one of my addresses to another I use 5 sat byte. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:01:48
Holly shit! Did not know about this! 
Although, I'd still have to recommend a hardware wallet, this is a good alternative for small funds to give to people. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:20:38
I put a transaction through for 600 sat/byte ($12), and it went through instantly! I paid waaaaay too much
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:08:22
Pre-segwit was even transaction at risk of being changed or was it only specific transactions which were malleable, based on the way the transaction is structured? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:36:52
This is actually a good idea. A few years ago I gave a book and some btc to someone on reddit as a kk gift. I was undecided on giving keeping a copy of the private key and ended up not keeping a copy. As I thought it'd be unfair for the person as I could be tempted to steal it. 
Years later and the coin hasn't moved. It's worth over $100 and I just know the person hasn't thought about it at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:20:06
Hopefully that's the idea. It's a "race to the bottom" in terms of fees and users get close to  $0 transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:19:28
It's absolutely fine to transfer back to Coinbase and put the sell order there. 
By doing this your bitcoin will be on Coinbase for a limited time, which is acceptable. The problem is leaving it on Coinbase long term as you are exposing yourself to an attack. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:52:07
I don't have real numbers for you but I imagine it's quite small. That works out to be 11 transactions a second. I understand lightning is just sending small amounts of text back and forth.

Huge responsibility? I run a full node. It uses approx 150 GB of space, uses a few hundred GB in upload data, some compute and ram required. That's about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:50:39
Up voted! This really needs to be stickied. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:06:00
You could do RBF (replace by fee) if you sent it using that feature. Not all wallets support that. Essentially you can increase the fee on the transaction to make it go through. 
My transaction was dropped after around 15 days. However I've also heard the mempool has a 300MB limit and that could've done it too. You may want to read into that. 
If the transaction was from one of your addresses to another one which you own, just don't stress and wait a week. 
If it's to someone else, just wait it out. Unfortunately there's too much congestion right now and we need more people using segwit addresses and for until other scaling measures can be implemented.

Exactly this. It's even safe to type an address in and send btc without checking the address. If you make a typo/typos there's a far greater chance of your transaction being denied than your transaction going to an address that is not yours. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:22:44
That's true. And if a fork lacks replay protection and it is a shitcoin which nobody wants then any replay attack on the other chain would be irrelevant.

It'll add another security concern I guess. You'd only want to run the software if it's open source and guaranteed to not do anything crazy as it'll have your private keys.

It's best practice to generate a new address for every transaction. However in cases like this if you aren't concerned if people can see the total btc you've earned selling lemonade it shouldn't matter. 
A wallet will automatically generate a new address for you once funds are received to the current address.

@_date: 2017-12-07 12:47:42
You'll initially open up a lightning channel to a lightning node. This will be a transaction on the blockchain and will incur a fee. Once your channel created you can transact as much as you want through lightning, these fees will be less than fees on the (main) blockchain. 
When you close you close your lightning channel there will be another transaction on the main blockchain (with a fee). 
I'm certain there will always be transactions on the main blockchain, and miners will always be incentivised to mine. You may even get organisations willing to contribute mining power to the network, because they rely on the blockchain so much.

About a month ago I switched to segwit addresses on my Trezor. I put a batch transaction through at a low fee, like 10 sat/byte. I figured 1 of 2 things would happen:

I checked on it weeks later and it had 'cleared'.

@_date: 2017-12-17 06:24:14
That's true, but any time there's a fork it's another check that needs to be done. 
There's also wallets and exchanges who need to decide which coin is the one they'll support. If they support both, that's extra development work and costs. Dev time which could be spent on other things. 
Then there's the media drama and confusion from people.

I'd love to run a lightning hub, in order to contribute to the network. I have no interest in generating fees, because I'd like lightning to be extremely cheap (ideally close to zero satoshi's). 
However if I have a channel to person X and person Y. And they both have a channel to a major hub like person A, will there be any need for using my hub? 
If everybody connects to major hubs, will minor hubs be useless? I'm asking because ideally we need a few hubs between parties to increase anonymity right?

Small transactions aren't being abandoned. These things take time to develop. Bitcoin is still in early days and is highly experimental and is continually being developed.

If you expand the blocks you aren't addressing the problem. You'll have to increase the block size again in the future and again and again until you have massive blocks. It's unsustainable. 
So it's best to use the current block space efficiently first. Segwit reduces the block weight. Schnorr signatures and mast will reduce it further. Meaning more transactions per block. Then lightning networks will work for off chain transactions. These are where day to day transactions will occur. The blockchain is far too valuable a resource to have everyone's coffee purchase recorded in it.

As the Mexicans would say over the heated debate over soft or hard shell tacos... Por que lo nos dos!

Is there more mining power for BTC. Do you have a website showing each POW coin and how much mining support it has? I'd like to see the numbers of this is true.

Why does it say "bought using Visa debit"? The blockchain doesn't care about how you obtained the bitcoin.

It took segwit a long time to go under way. It might be too optimistic to assume lightning will he ready in a few months.

Where's this trading floor?

That's all and nice but if they don't get paid how do they live day to day? And if they are only coding BTC in their leisure time, wouldn't it be better to have full time devs?

Where does it break in the recovery? I know when I practices recovery I failed because I didn't read everything correctly. I put the words back in order. However it tells you the words in a random order. So it's good to check that order.

Simple words. But that's why I first got into Bitcoin.

Not a bad way to handle it. I find it annoying how everyone has to jump through hoops because 2x doesn't have replay protection. Why aren't they including replay protection? Even worse, I've heard some people saying that BTC should be the ones creating replay protection. 
Even so they do tell you multiple times to withdraw your funds from the exchange, so it's pretty obvious what you need to do.

Are the big Chinese mining farms part of the NYA? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:27:53
Yep. If you have 1 BTC you have 1 BTC.

That title is a post-hoc fallacy.

What fees do you pay to Coinbase for them to offer this professional service? Their position on which fork they will support has been so crazy that to trust them with your coins is madness.

Institutional investors are the ones who will pour money in. Whether it's through an ETF or a platform like this doesn't matter too much.

Have you checked the public key to verify the funds are still on there (no reason why they wouldn't be though). Also did you have multiple paper wallets left around the house? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:28:36
Has this ever been a problem? 
@_date: 2017-10-28 05:35:29
No, illegal is written by the law in tact right now. 
If you are looking at history. Then History is written by the winners.

Can anyone verify this? I've always trusted bitaddress and wouldn't have expected something like this.

Samourai recently added segwit support! I've now got my Trezor funds and my Samourai funds on segwit. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:50:24
It means at this stage 83.4% of the mining power will go to 2x. Which is a problem as it means less power for BTC and 2x doesn't have many developers.

Also put in this was an illegal vote. By not voting you are either against the movement, or don't care.

I really don't like it when the use the term 'segwit coin'. To me anyone calling it that seems to lack any technical oversight and doesn't really understand the technology. They are just getting swept up in the drama and politics of crypto.
