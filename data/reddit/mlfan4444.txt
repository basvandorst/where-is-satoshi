OP doesn't want to spread that FUD so he keeps the day count low

Counterpoint: Bitcoin fees were insane, LN wasn't running, Transaction speeds were slow, mempool at 200k+, but Bitcoin was trading at $19k
Market doesn't care about the tech
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:05:54
What correction?
It's been at 11k for a few days now
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:46:14
More like day 30

What happens when the dollar pops

Go all in then 
What other asset will give you 1000% returns in a year?

It's like calling someone fat or ugly
You might be right, but it's not a nice comment

The world will be in great disarray if the USD falls.
The value of bitcoin will be the last thing on anyone's mind.
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:33:23
You're saying the dollar is going to lose value for some unknown reason, and the next step to insure its value is the US government attacking either 1. a random country, or 2. itself
You realize how ridiculous that sounds right?

Yikes they even went through my post history
It's spicy in here
Also brother if you looked a little more carefully I am a "Tesla fanboy" 
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:44:04
No, please explain.

These people get very salty when you attack their bitcoin
And since your points can't be refuted, they resort to personal attacks
Don't take it personally - they just can't make a strong enough case for bitcoin so they'll resort to name calling

with who?
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:19:05
Y'all are taking financial advice from Rachel Ray, but are ignoring Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett?

What's on Monday
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:13:50
Apple and other "big stocks" are not purely speculative unlike Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:29:20
You can't
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:31:47
It's always good to learn more
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:06:22
You could have bought a lamborghini with about 12 bitcoin in December
Just offer them 12 bitcoin now, it's no different
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:25:15
Wtf are you talking about
Nowhere in the article does it mention 2008 or "10x"
