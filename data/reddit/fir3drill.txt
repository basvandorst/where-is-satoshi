Awesome, thanks.  First five year-old worthy response.
So, exchanges like MtGox get confused by the crease in the bill?

Thanks for the response.  What makes this so much more secure?
Do I need to hide the private key somewhere?
I am almost completely ignorant about cryptography, so thanks in advance.

Started by buying .05.
But I wanted a full one.
I feel so alive.
@_date: 2014-03-13 02:07:54
This is exactly how I feel.  I got way more than ~$620 worth of utility from the purchase.

Can you point me to a site that gives detailed step-by-step instructions to do this?  And what makes it so secure?
Sorry for the ignorance.

I am a newcomer to the Bicoin movement, so I have a question that may be dumb.
Why do people keep their coins in an exchange?  It seems like if I ever buy a bitcoin, I will immediately transfer it to an offline wallet for security reasons and transfer back to an exchange if I ever want to sell it.
Am I missing something?

And the mutated transaction won't affect the blockchain?
If so, why not?

I like this a lot actually.
The only knock I have about it is that when I use a credit card, I get miles...
Any way around that?

That makes sense.
So lets say I'm interested in buying a bitcoin.  Here's my thought process:
* Setup a new bank account somewhere and transfer ~$550 into it.
* Link the new bank account to Coinbase (they seem to have the easiest purchase process.  Correct me if I'm wrong).
* Simultaneously, create a paper wallet with the extra encryption you mentioned and immediately transfer my newly purchased bitcoin from the exchange to the paper wallet.
Here's where I'm a bit confused:
* Print out the paper wallet and what?  Cut away the private key part of the wallet and store in a safe or bank deposit box?
Does this process make sense?  Am I over- or under-simplifying it?
I appreciate your patience, mate.

Meh, it was less of an investment than me just being interested in the currency and protocol.  Say what you will about its validity as a currency, but the underlying protocol and public ledger have HUGE implication and understanding them better benefits me, I believe.

Sorry, I was unclear. I meant that if an ASIC chip was customized to a specific application outside mining, what could it do?
Are they widely used in other industries?

Okay, how do the mechanics of mutating a hash work?
If the mutated transaction is still valid and can be confirmed into a block, why isn't that a problem, independent of the exchange withdrawals?

The good feeling from the purchase.  I don't think I'm going to spend it for some time.

Every time I click "Get Address", is it producing a separate wallet connected to my Circle account?
@_date: 2014-01-21 18:45:49
I was unclear in the original post.  I meant if ASIC chips were designed for a different function, what are some applications/industries where they could be useful?
@_date: 2014-02-19 19:56:29
But there are people protesting at Mt. Gox who had thousands of coin on the exchange.  Was that stupidity on their part or are there other reasons to do that?
