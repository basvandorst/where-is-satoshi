The API was up, and most people who were already logged in could still trade, but the front-end went down in seconds and I personally got booted in under a minute, couldn't log back in for almost 30min.

What's different about securing large amounts? If anything there are more options for secure storage than ever now.

Same here; I'd like to try them out but our utility bills aren't in my name and they won't take anything else.

Did you have a custom password or were you using one of the generated ones?

Interesting.. Same situation here, sold Thursday, said funds would arrive today and this is the first time the deposit wasn't pending when I woke up.

Interesting.. I got that same email as an auto-response to the two I sent yesterday. Hopefully they take care of it the way everyone says they will. Thanks.

Curious to see what they say then. I only had 2 orders canceled in a night then I stopped trying, but 1 was rather large (for me, suppose that's relative) and the other relatively small.
If they honor my orders now at the price I originally got yeah they'd be taking a loss, but that's due to how long it's taking them to resolve it really, I contacted them immediately.
I'm getting worked up over nothing though, haven't even heard back yet so I'll just wait and see. Thanks again for the update.

Good chunk as in not your full order? Better than nothing I guess but I was hoping they'd just un-cancel the orders. At least they're getting back to people though, thanks for the update.

Would you say that's worth it for someone who can only afford a few BTC? I'm trying to get into bitcoin but not quite sure what to do with it..

I'm not OP but I'm in the same situation and really hope this is the case.. 2 of my orders were canceled for being "high risk" but I have a level 2 account and never had a problem before. I would just rebuy but the price exploded overnight.

Did you ever hear back from coinbase? I'm in the same boat now..
