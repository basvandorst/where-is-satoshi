I imply that if you lose your private key you cannot spend your bitcoins, which I summarize as "you lose your bitcoins", since from any practical point of view it is strictly equivalent.
If you have a backup of your private key, you can lose the device.
My "implication" was as accurate as saying "if you lose the hard disk containing a private key, you lose the content of files stored elsewhere and encrypted with the said key". Indeed, if you have a copy of the key, you can lose the hard disk, and indeed "losing the files" means "losing any meaningful way of using the files'  content".
Let me guess, you are a bitcoin enthusiast?

Not that I disagree with you on the ideological criticism of speculation, but you are basically claiming that all the people investing in moneys are not *investing*.

Putting aside the ridicule of the problem here, more generally, PayPal is responsible for the legality of the stuff paid through them? So if I buy a rubber duck from China, pay it with PayPal, eat it, and it appears that it contains more lead than the EU regulations allow, and I get sick, I can sue PayPal? Sweet!

What is mandatory? To ask customers to justify what they are planning to do with their money?
@_date: 2014-05-02 06:03:55
All this is pretty confusing. As far as I understand, the "Choke Hold" operation targets persons who facilitate money laundering and scams. Why do porn actors/actresses end up being the target? Is there an article giving some explanations?

There seems to be more and more examples of banks asking their customers to justify what they want to do with their own money. Is it legal?
I know that with my bank (UBS, in live in Switzerland), had they asked something like "What did you try to buy?" I would have told them that this is none of their business. If I do something illegal, the police should question me, not the bank.
@_date: 2014-04-02 15:09:44
Because I have actually a pretty precise idea how it works. You should not understand "As far as I understand" as "I have no idea" but as an invitation to anybody more competent to complement / correct anything I may say wrong.

You realize that when we discuss the meaning of a word, the question is not what you would like it to mean, or what you incorrectly think it means, but what is the standard definition of the said word in the society we are both living in?
And as a matter of fact, this is the definition of the verb *to invest*:
    inˈvest/
    verb
    gerund or present participle: investing
    
        1.
        expend money with the expectation of achieving a profit or material result by putting it into     financial schemes, shares, or property, or by using it to develop a commercial venture.
        "getting workers to invest in private pension funds"
        synonyms:	put money into, provide capital for, fund, back, finance, subsidize,     bankroll, underwrite; More


So indeed, if I believe that the USD for some reason will be worth more good in the future, I can invest in it, as much as I can invest in a wonderful startup building internet-connected spoons, not because I need spoons, because similarly I believe it will make me richer in the future.
I have to say, it is only on reddit that I regularly debate the meaning of a word, me claiming it means what its definition says, and my interlocutor claiming that it means what she/he things it *should* mean.

My point was that wrote that bitcoins cannot be frozen, confiscated, etc. Which I think is not true. If a judge rules that you have to transfer xxx bitcoins to the IRS, how is it easier to disobey than if he said you have to give xxx USD from your bank account, or xxx gold coins from the chest hidden in your garden?
@_date: 2014-04-02 11:59:05
AFAIU, it is a device that allows you to do bitcoin payments.
When you create a bitcoin wallet, you create a private key associated to it. Anybody with access to your private key can take your money. So the main problem is to protect it, which is difficult since you must access it every time you make a payment. So it has to be somewhere on your computer, and programs must be able to access it.
Here the private key is **in** the device, and the only thing the device accepts to do is to validate a payment if you physically click on the right button. The device will never allow anybody to read the private key from the cable (it can display it on the screen, if you click on the right button).
So the application for the payment interact with the device, but the core critical operation, the validation of the payment, is done by the device. The private key never leaves it unless you have physical access to it. Bottom line: If someone hacks your PC without physical access to it, it can not steal your bitcoins.

@_date: 2014-04-02 18:18:03
I find just strange that a statement that would be perfectly fine in the context of hard-disk / files becomes the subject of so much objections when it is about wallet / bitcoins.
The only explanation I have of all these very strange and passionate objections is that they are driven by ideology. Hence my question.
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:26:22


Because your responses are in a stream of similar responses, which are moronic if a very directed way.


@_date: 2014-08-12 06:12:50
Because that argument can not be used for cash? And you really think that would help?

The thing is that bitcoins provide a everlasting trace of your transactions. Which means that the day the IRS is interested in you, you have to (1) have been super careful when moving money around (2) trust graph theory and mixing services.
The paranoid me thinks that there is no official backlash against bitcoins because it is actually far easier for agencies to trace on a large scale, in particular because there is always a mistake at some point somewhere, and the transaction record allows you to retrieve a lot of information from it.
@_date: 2014-04-02 15:05:53
You are hairsplitting, and I strongly disagree with you.
If you lose the device, you lose your bitcoins. As much as if you lose a hard disk you lose the data on it. As much as if you lose a piece of paper, you lose the information on it.
That you can make a backup is really a accessory property, and my writing was presenting it as such.
You would not have been shocked if I had explained the concept of hard disk to someone saying that "if you lose it you lose its content". And a totally separate paragraph explaining the concept of backup. This is the same here.
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:06:04


I wonder how much writing "they will have a backup" instead of "they should have a backup" expose you legally if someone loses his bitcoins because she/he loses the device or because the device has a malfunction.
I understand that it is *very easy* to backup the key with the TREZOR, however, what you write is similar to me as if Western-Digital was from now on putting a sticker "ALWAYS HAVE A SECONDARY BACKUP OF YOUR DATA" on every HD they manufacture and from there the CEO claims in any interview "You cannot lose data with our hard-disk, since if it fails, you **will** have a backup."


This is a misleading example: having a recovery procedure does not require to have done something in the past to recover. And this is the core problem with backup: Anybody is convinced that a backup is a good idea when they need it because they do not have it.
Edit: "can not lose" -&gt; "cannot lose" *sigh*

If the private key associated to the wallet is lost, I can promise you that the coins are "lost" indeed.
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:22:23


If you have a backup of your private key, they are not lost. But this comes back to my hard disk comparison.
If for you the main point is that "losing the private key required to access the content of a file X" is not the same as "losing the file X", then we do disagree strongly, and encryption disagrees with you.

People put money in Switzerland to avoid the IRS *to be aware of it*. As soon as the IRS knows you do have money abroad, you will have to pay.
What I am writing, but that people in this subreddit seems to have difficulties to grasp, is that bitcoins are worst than cash for secrecy, and does not help at all in term of avoiding sanctions.
@_date: 2014-04-02 12:26:09
If someone steals it, she/he can steal your money.
If the device is destroyed / erased, you lose the ability to make payments from your wallet, which means that all your bitcoins are lost.
**However**, as far as I understand, the private key in generated in such a way that you can get a "backup", which takes the form of a list of ~20 English words. This list is generated randomly and used as a "seed" for the private key.
So you can ask the device to display this secret list of words, you can write it down somewhere, and in the event that your device is destroyed, you can buy a new one, enter the backupped words in some manner, and you get your private key back.
Of course you have to protect this backup as much as the device itself.

I guess you and makinmoneyyall disagree on the meaning of what is a "good" banking system. For most of the people it means that it facilitates the functioning of the economy. For makinmoneyyall it probably means that bankers are very efficient at diverting money to their own interest. And you can not contradict him on that, us bankers kick ass in term of performing well for themselves.
In his world view, mcdonalds is probably the most advanced feeding organization in the world, and traditional Neapolitan pizzas are "backward".
