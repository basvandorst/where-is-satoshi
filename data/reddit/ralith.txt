Isn't a big enough thing for law enforcement to have bothered with yet. Tracing real-world trade between uncooperative parties takes a lot of work.

All transfers of bitcoins are published globally. Anyone who cared could trivially find out where they sent them, and eventually they'd end up at an address that could be tied to the real world. From there it could be traced to the original recipient.

Yeah, a skype-style browser extension could make this extremely convenient.

There's been a lot of press lately; probably a speculation bubble.

A personal attack on the commenter who bothers to call you out on inventing data, and no actual counterpoint? Classy.

Sure, and Garzik's relevant for technical questions about Bitcoin.

It's more a question of who owns the servers than the law.

Because trademark law doesn't work that way.

Not all the way to $1, I don't think, but there's no question of whether it'll drop again.

In response to which they can trivially register another domain.  Not a serious problem.

It hardly matters.

It's like someone from the IANA being described as a representative of the Internet.
@_date: 2011-06-11 14:17:51
There has been now.

I think it's more carefully selecting which words you omit to make the quote sound more offensive :P

Or publishers!

It seems like the infinitely-divisible nature of bitcoins will help address that.
@_date: 2011-02-12 03:03:54
What's your point?
@_date: 2011-05-03 06:22:47
Relax, it was a joke.
@_date: 2011-10-18 10:29:24
Sounds like something a Packer would say. *sneer*

And what do you think runs DNS?  A basement full of chinese grad students?

You misread the article.  "May soon be due for a crackdown" implies that the author thinks it's likely to suffer one soon, not that the she thinks it should.
