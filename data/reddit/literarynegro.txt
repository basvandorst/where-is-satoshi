TY! Reading it

still, the buzz is getting louder with every passing minute. Ppl feverishly trying to get bitcoins without fully understanding it, how to keep it, protect it, etc. It will only take some massive hack or some other unfortunate event and everybody will lose any confidence in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:41:19
unless it falls flat on its face and then bye-bye bitcoin.

How can they buy bitcoin with ZIGGAP? Also why do they need instawallet? Can't they just send the coin from ZIGGAP account to our bitcoin wallet? OR do they need instawallet to deposit their bitcoin there so they do not need to install the whole bitcoin shabang to their comp?

ok, that is good to know. BUT the average person who can barely use Facebook and is scared of how reddit looks like will not be able to do it let alone know about it. In other words if someone can set up a scam like this there will be a significant portion of population who will be vulnerable, especially when bitcoin is mainstream. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:10:58
I have been arguing the same earlier. Glad I am not alone, because I sure do care for bitcoin. The situation is like fever right now, ppl cannot rstrain themselves.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:32:26
I expressed similar concern some time ago about paper wallet: 
This actually worries me a lot. The average member of the public is clueless and clearly cannot look up the code. I would even say that average member of the public does not know what a code is. 
With all hype about bitcoin recently we will be hearing more and more stories like this. People jump in without full realization and knowledge. This is a serious threat to bitcoin, we all need to realize this. The average person knows shit about computers, codes, FPGA farms, etc. This makes them more vulnerable as ever to be robbed anonymously and nicely. This is a new Wild West, and it has zero risk for robbers and 100% risk for average users. 
I am very concerned and I think everyone should be too. 
EDIT: Also scamming and robbing people is easy now than ever. The scammers will prey on newbies/comp illiterate ones. Like set up hundreds of sites and blogs Bitcoin 101 for newbies, give them "instructions" and then rob them. None of these ppl know about or bitcoin talk. They google "what is a bitcoin" and go from there. I see this as Achilles heel for the bitcoin.

post anyway, there is a sign of intelligent life here, we read it, just ignore frat boys.

I am a freelance academic ghostwriter and I accept bitcoin: 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:37:41
the flaw is human nature, the human nature, greed, selfishness, egoistic mentality is what kills everything good we can come up with. Bitcoin has demonstrated it perfectly well. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:00:13
precisely. The idea behind the bitcoin is good. But then you get hoards of speculators and other vultures they will mess up everything. They always have more funds than anyone else in whatever form: currency, gold, money, water resources, oil, you name it. They will always pop up to kill everything good the humanity can come up with. As long as they exist "we can't have good things". 
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:54:41
yes, but like for because I've seen some offers here from people/businesses that are not part of this wiki. Put it on sidebar here, 
EDIT: I would love to add my offer there too, how do I add it to this wiki though? 
@_date: 2013-03-31 17:49:41
ok, but let's say I am gonna prey on average Joes that are computer illiterate. I will set up a site similar to  and I will make sure I will have a copy of every address and private key generated. I will hire the best people to make it happen. Then I will create a campaign to scare Joe's into having cold paper wallet. Then I will wait and wait and wait and then I rob them all. Or I will rob some of them. Close site, and I'm out with motherload. What would prevent someone from doing this?? Sure, computer literate will not use my site, but when bitcoin is mainstream I will have plenty of customers. 
@_date: 2013-03-31 18:47:38
they will not know whom to block. Because everything will be done posteriori. You will accumulate data for years, you will appear legit and rob them at once and then just disappear into the sunset. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 16:36:31
that sucks. We do not want to endanger our donors, we have few of them to begin with. Maybe it is not a good idea then. How about other ways donors can make bitcoins? I found coinworker, is there anything else similar to that where they can "earn" bitcoins and send it to us? 
@_date: 2013-03-31 16:06:33
ok, got it. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-03-22 16:23:24
Well, this might work. It is expensive, but at this point we are desperate for any financial support. So let me reiterate this just to make it sure I got it right. Our donor can buy a money order or western union and mail it to buybitcoin.com to be deposited to their account. From there they can send bitcoin to our bitcoin account. How safe is buybitcoin.com for our donors I mean? 
EDIT: I am looking at  and I am not even sure I understand what is going on there.

Then drop is tip for me once you've earned something.

what caused the crash in 2011? 
Here is how I see it unfolding. 12000 waiting to be verified in Mt.Gox, it will continue to rise b/c there is no shortage of bad economic news. Then something will happen, a hack, Mt.Gox gets killed, whatever. It will burst, shitload of ppl will lose a lot. They will acquire strong aversion to bitcoin. It will take a long time if ever to build it up again. I am worried. Nothing grows from 80 to 160 in 2 weeks. This is insane and it worries me. Sure some will ride this, but the potential for damage is too damn high. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:42:56
Do you really think that Aunt Sally or grandpa Josh will be able to do this? 
@_date: 2013-03-22 16:07:42
thank you! Alternatively can a person for example buy a bitcoin there for their current price (85.92) and then send the coin to our account? Or will it be even more complicated for a housewife or a grandma (no offense, but this is what happens with our main donors and we love them dearly and want to make it as easy as possible for them). 
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:51:20
I doubt she knows what qrcodes are. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 17:15:42
Thank you. So there is no way around it. They will have to go to some place and deposit cash. It works only in the US? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:00:53
but again, now she is vulnerable to being hacked as blockchain will get hacked sooner than later, especially if bitcoin will continue to grow as it does now. Sure, people get robbed all the time now. But it takes some cojones to rob Aunt Sally at gun point and one always leaves the trail of evidence, imgages on security cameras etc. With bitcoin, it is anonymous and clean. You rob the shit out of people, no one knows who you are, where you are. This is scary, don't you see it? 
@_date: 2013-03-29 18:50:01
no, it could not  be. So if someone steals this file from my laptop, he essentially gets the key to my wallet?? What stops someone from hacking into my computer while I am online, copying .dat file and then corrupt my .dat file on my laptop? He now has my wallet key and I have nothing. Or do I miss the point how it works??
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:04:03
The safest way is not to ask for advice here, it is way too risky at this point. (see the post about bitinstant and a person being downvoted for it)
@_date: 2013-03-29 19:18:20
should I encrypt and  regularly back up .dat file then in case my laptop goes in flames tomorrow? Then I can just install another wallet and add (or replace it) with my old .dat file??
what about this wallet that is offered by electrum that can be opened with some weird phrase they give you? 
@_date: 2013-03-22 17:00:24
but how will donors get bitcoin to donate with? Sorry for keep asking, I am pretty new to this and a bit confused. Our donors are not very computer savvy, so the goal is to find the simplest and safest way to donate (if possible). None of them have bitcoins as of now.

"Managing partner Gatis Eglitis claims they are now getting 20 calls a day from large asset managers looking to invest up to $100m.”" 
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:58:20
I think it is. I am a freelancer offering BTC option, everybody like yeah, uhm, whatever... Then you see the constant stream of all these "I am debt free, thanks bitcoin" on a front page and those "I just got robbed, help" downvoted into oblivion, it makes you really wonder. Reddit can be easily manipulated, people have to be careful, very careful, especially newbies.
