i think it's just that a lot of dinosaurs are getting exposed to BTC now that its all over the news and financial shows/newspapers/etc.   My dad has been texting me about it for the last month.
A lot of people are buying now because of the futures trading announcement because they expect a huge price jump once futures open up.

ive been following bitcoin since the beginning and this sentiment has been so prevelant and led to so much heartbreak because what seems like "not much" now could easily make you a millionare 5 years down the road.  My $60 dollars in BTC i had (and lost) back in 2012 didnt seem like much then or worth paying attention to, but i'd have a nice $100k nestegg now if i would have just had the foresight to pay more attention
Putting in a hundred is nice because you're basically betting on the long term feasibility of BTC and you basically stand to either lose an insignificant amount, or gain a substantial amount that could change your life.
