that's my issue with anyone who states that "drugs are bad mmmkay?" because they're mostly dangerous because they are illegal, if we had the chance to buy ecstasy in a store with a warning label saying "don't take 30 you idiot" then you have a lot safer pill poppers out there having a good time, you still have a minority abusing it because guess what, that minority always abuses it as they are usually addicts, you see it with alcohol or any legal substance, there will be people who are a danger to themselves and banning something from everyone because of those few dumb people is a fucking waste of everyone's time.

when drugs are legal they're safer, that's fact, look at portugal.
I want my kid to have equal access to all drugs because it's better than shady access to some drugs.  If you actually think banning something gets rid of it you're the moron without life experience who needs to look around and see that making something illegal just makes it unsafe for the smart people who did that now illegal thing.
Do you think morphine should be banned, what about adderall, that's heroine and cocaine that's freely available because someone figured out how to ban the natural version and create a sellable drug.

I know of BTG, what else was there?

yup, I like the people bringing up the drop from $30 to $2, it almost seems cyclical.

Holy shit, I had no idea

I got mine at 350, then sold for 500 thinking i was some kind of smarty pants for about 3 hours, then regretted that sell ever since.
Still held some, but sold far too much at 500.

And the same applies with electrum where you get access to both chains with the same coin?
