it's just like any stock. You choose to hold or sell right away. But the longer the waves ride, they stabilize and the value stabilizes with it

seems like you're just anti-bitcoin for some reason but can you provide some insight to why you're against investing in BTC? 
@_date: 2017-03-23 19:51:07
bummer. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:50:07
so you're saying keeping them in exchanges is ok?
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:55:53
ELI5 anyone? 
@_date: 2017-03-03 17:26:16
I have mycelium

Does Gemini have an android app? Also is it an exchange similar to coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:27:24
cool, and considering I don't have a lot of money invested in BTC I'm going to ride the waves with no sweat. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:31:24
Agree, people are posting just to harvest karma like most on here. They think if they self-post about HODL then they'll get lotsa fake internet points. 
Do they go on NYSE forums and talk about what they're holding every day? 
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:47:29
Sort of related, can you hold onto your BTC in coinbase or mycelium? Or is it preferred to store them elsewhere? 
@_date: 2017-03-08 18:08:44
adult life, everyone
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:29:19
Also, word on the street is that BTC is shady because it's used by drug dealers or black market things. I always thought "so is cash but no one bitches about cash." 
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:02:19
So what? This doesn't seem like a big deal. It's gone unapproved since it's existence and that hasn't stopped it's value from climbing. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:55:51
45000 of them so far
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:53:40
Ease of use for me, also my computer is old and could die at any moment. And I don't have thousands of $ in coins, I only have a few (which i can afford to lose if market crashes or theft, etc). I have private keys in a different app. Also I'm TeamAndroid and like the security options I have on my phone. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 15:26:19
sorry, forgot to mention this. Which i don't really understand since it's legal but anywho
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:07:20
how so? Just looked at the price and it's been pretty stable since it hit $600. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:32:15
dare I mention my opinion or will i get censored?

I don't follow, Bitcoin Cash is on fire? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:09:54
I sent a $10 payment last week and the fee was $6. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:01:20
you should do some research on the fees. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:00:49
Welcome to Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:00:38
He would be annoyed at how high the fees were and then he'd have to wait 3 hours for confirmation to send to his wallet
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:44:12
you mean banks!

Is Mycelium an exchange? 
@_date: 2017-05-01 16:53:16
Just waiting for the huge drop so I can buy. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 18:06:43
well you shoulda said that in the title bud!

how in the hell do you even remember how to type your username? 
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:50:55
is this why baseball players are getting $300 million contracts at the same time there are people making $8/hr living in Section 8? 
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:43:20
can someone ELI5 dogecoin? it seems like just a big joke but yet, there it exists
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:47:00
no. I have used CB lots and never given them that info. Not sure why OP did. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:08:44
That's the ONLY thing is you can verify your driver's license to validate yourself. Never SSN or proof of residence. @_date: 2017-07-11 18:36:52

I wasn't bothered by the fees coinbase charged but I was moreso bothered by the mining fees Mycelium required when I transferred there

i call bullshit. This is just like some r/iamverybadass shit where people say "This 300 lb dude bumped into my wife and I knocked him out" it ain't real. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:13:59
why's that?

why not? 
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:44:47
expected to see you elaborate when i clicked on the title. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:26:12
Yes, you have to buy your coins
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:09:29
ohhhhhhhh ok. remember the multiple posts saying 'i just sold all my coins and my daughter's college is paid off' or 'i sold all my coins and am now debt free'
this is what i'm referring to. they cashed out, through a bank. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:11:12
but currently I can think of several things i'd like to pay off that don't accept btc as payment. 
Student loans
car payments
 
utility bills
see what I'm going for here? 
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:57:48
I RES-tagged you as "the only rational one" 
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:19:06
sorry, i was targeting this question specifically toward the holders who want cash instead of buying goods 
@_date: 2017-06-29 15:39:49
Mycelium let's you choose higher or lower fees. And if you're too low, you can bump it while it's waiting on confirmation 
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:45:12
go check out @_date: 2017-06-29 19:14:04
and it's a dumb question unless you're asking an all-knowing being. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:30:48
it's funny, it went down to $2400~ then immediately bounced back to 27. the new floor has been set
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:42:20
Your opinion differs from mine, and that is fine. but I stand by what I said. thanks for your response 
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:05:14
top comment.

Miss out on the big event as they all say. When Segwit activates and the hard fork happens
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:54:26
RemindMe! but srsly, let me know how the bank takes it. this has always been my main concern, but i don't win money anyway so it shouldn't matter haha
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:52:14
good point.

How many of the 21 million are left? 
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:09:55
sorry, that's what i meant. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:16:15
Are you new to bitcoin? I looked through your posts and I'm assuming you are. Also, this is a very post-heavy sub so don't be alarmed that this post isn't getting attention. 
If you had a low transaction fee it will take a long long time to get confirmed. I'm not sure there's much else you can do. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:17:18
I wouldn't be afraid using your credit card for buying on a trusted exchange. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:29:44
yea but when you cash out you have to withdraw to a bank right? 
@_date: 2017-07-11 16:28:15
Why is this marked NSFW? because it barely looks like some Fallopian tubes? c'mon 
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:40:06
If you're worried about this, I've heard Credit Unions are more bitcoin friendly as well as Ally Bank (since it's an internet bank)
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:01:47

@_date: 2017-06-12 18:34:37
For a second I thought OP was a coinbase big wig. I was about to upvote the shit outta you! 
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:46:03

@_date: 2017-06-20 20:45:59
I know but I don't want to miss it so I'm trying to be prepared 
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:22:18
Thanks Trump 
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:58:43
worst case scenario it'll be refunded if it never gets confirmed. right now there's mass panic and the slow confirmations are part of the response. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:59:25
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:22:51
there's a whole sub that may help you @_date: 2017-06-28 15:05:56

Just a suggestion, don't pour all your wealth into bitcoin. I mean, i wouldn't take my rent payment and invest it for gains later in life because i need to pay rent this month!

@_date: 2017-06-20 20:30:02
If I hold (hodl) my coin in wallet where I control the keys, will this Segwit/Hard Fork/Unlimited vs Core thing affect me? 
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:13:40
I was wondering same. I've heard about localbitcoins but not sure how it all works 
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:07:11
what site? 
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:11:41
I think $2000 is the hard floor. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:38:34
can someone ELI5 how this and other wallets work? Where are the coins stored? Because this only generates the private keys offline right? 
@_date: 2017-06-29 16:08:10
but this is the current state of bitcoin, that's not a Mycelium issue
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:34:02
that thumbnail....
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:45:57
Because it's getting more press and people are buying expecting to get free money and become rich. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:02:14
So yes coinbase is having issues, but it's the largest exchange in the world so i doubt they're going to respond to an open ticket immediately. they're biggest priority is getting the site up

How did you cash out? How did your bank take the activity?
