Facebook is a political campaign and advertisement/marketing platform that is pretty much a money printing press with as much revenue as it earns. I don't think myspace ever came close to the market power that Facebook holds. It is definitely gonna take a wrecking ball to knock it down. I'd love to see it for sure because I absolutely hate it.

Sorry for the dumb question, but can someone tell me the benefit of running a BitCoin node on this rather than from my main computer hardware? I'm looking to start a node here for my area on my main Windows OS. Does it just offload the work?

USAA is by far the best bank to choose in my opinion. Very friendly and helpful staff make all the difference combined with Tier 1 services. Very exclusive though.

My plan is to run the node while I'm at work, then shut it down when I come home and use it for gaming or whatever. I'm unsure on how big of a performance hit I will be taking running the node in all honesty, so I can't really comment on how I will be doing it just yet. I was hoping this hardware would allow me to off load the work enough so I can still use it for a general purpose while at home, but it looks like I under estimate how much load a node really takes up.

Wasn't Bitcoin close to 1k not too long ago?

Ebay is great for a buyer, but they will not think twice about throwing a seller under a bus. Ebay has ran off a large chunk of their non-business entity (private seller) base, so now it's pretty much become a higher priced and shittier Amazon.com

Ah yes excellent point. I guess more options is always better than fewer options.

Why would anyone who knows anything about BitCoins ever trust a bank enough to give them their BitCoins? It's good overall, but definitely not something smart people should be on board with.

This lightening network sounds pretty awesome. Is it something being developed? Any good info links you have handy would be cool to read.

Thanks for the awesome reply. Here are a few points I think I should have explained better.
1: With debit transactions, funds are not immediately removed from your account and placed into the seller's account. That usually takes several days. What actually happens is that his bank ask your bank, and they say "good to go," and promises to make the transaction with the available funds. With BitCoin, the transaction is done over a few minutes.
2: I'm not worried about making BTC transactions faster, I'm wondering if BTC becomes widespread, would the traffic bog down the network and make them slower?
3: So if we plan to make BTC widespread and used in daily lives, how would we process purchasing a cup of coffee? We would have to have a better way than standing around for 10-30mins waiting for a 2 dollar transaction to get confirmed.
