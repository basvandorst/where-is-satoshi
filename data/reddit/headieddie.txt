I'm new to the topic aswell, but the best advice I've heard is to research and learn before investing. I could go off on some long tangent about how a decentralized "resource Based Economy" and "Noomap" will obsolete "trade" on the whole (www. Tromsite .com), but I'll spare you that one, and face the reality that we live in today. According to capitalist ideology, the function of an investor is to invest in companies they think will succeed. That is called "signaling to the market", and a good capitalist believes that through this mechanism, "the wisdom of the crowd" will be heard, and the free market will naturally arrive at funding the most effiecient life support systems for humanity. That is capitalism at its best, but that belief system has morphed and twisted itself into all sorts of distortions... I digress..  So, as an investor it is your job to signal to the market, and supposedly you will be rewarded the most for picking valuable projects, but that's just some utopian capitalist fantasy and reality is far from it. In reality, the most beneficial projects go unfunded due to the capitalism's structural need to return a profit to investors, or because the project seeks to remove that "need" from the market, thereby making an industry obsolete, aka cutting into/removing somebody else's profits.. What thrives under capitalism, and is allowed by the ideologues who run the world behind a veil of ignorance, is continual  "disaster relief" at best, not disaster avoidance. If you see a project that would vastly disrupt the opportunist's opportunity at cashing in on another's stolen fortune, RUN! They will shut that shut down fast.    The run of the scam alts possibly awoke some to the hilarity which is capitalism, maybe you won't be subjected to this mess your whole life. But in the meantime, good luck? And "Research a Resource Based Economy", the real one, not the "centralized" b.s. (bad science).

You don't understand wealth because you think money is real.

So, bitcoin is increasing the number of kids interested in math, so they don't need your help because of bitcoin, yet then they attempt to slam bitcoin. Those writers have zero sense.

It was nice to hear, I've subscribed, but I share some of the same concerns listed above. Feel free to delete the post and my comments.

It is an invitation to automate/obsolete their own/our jobs out of existence, which wouldn't be a bad thing in a more sanely structured operating system.

This is immensely important in that mission of showing the lawyers the door.

What are these numbers referring to?

If you aren't going to wait for an extruded home, or help build the global opensource commons of everything which builds and maintains the extruders of hempcomposite/hempfoam homes, atleast build with metal sips. Www.permatherm.net seriously bad ass performance to reduce solar needs.

Network effect bud.. it is all about the network effect.

Yep, their desire to hold that wealth would secure the commons enabling network, bringing transparency back to social aims, enabling the commons in populations larger than 140. Eh, I don't have time to explain this to another Morty.
