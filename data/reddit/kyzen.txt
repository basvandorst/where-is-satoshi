A $90 5770 will do upwards of 180.  A $170 6870 will do over 260.
It's ridiculously easy to top 150; almost any midrange or higher ATI card can hit it.
TBH, the OP's rate is rather pathetic - and definitely not profitable in any way.

It probably won't have a history that goes far enough back for you, but if you use Gmail, at the bottom of the page is a line that says:
"Last account activity: xx minutes ago at IP xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx.   Details"
Click details, and it'll show you your IP from your last few sessions with Gmail.  Maybe if you're lucky one will be old enough.
Barring that, have you tried contacting support?  I'm sure their turnaround time will be incredibly slow right now, but this seems like something they could assist with.

getting out while you still can, huh?  ;)
Not a bad price though for anybody looking to get into mining - I just priced out a ~525 mhash rig for $612.  Not sure what another $200 to my budget would've gotten me, but I somehow doubt it would double the mhash rate.

I have a couple of servers at home that are already on 24/7 for various purposes; they all have video cards of varying quality (they were all a primary gaming computer at one point).
I can pull about 400 Mhash/sec between them.  Would it be worth joining a mining pool at this point?  If so, which one actually generates returns worthwhile enough for my small operation?

Still, earlier difficulties were easier than it is now, right?

Yeah, well, so can my $95 5770, so there!  ;)
Seriously though, with the 5830's being pretty much permanently out of stock, 5770's seem like one of the next best values for us casual miners.  I just picked one up to put into an old machine I had lying around, if my current rates hold up, it'll pay itself off (including electricity) in a bit over a month.  Of course, as the difficulty goes up, that timeline gets pushed out, but I figure I'll still make at least a small profit on it before it becomes inefficient to run anymore.  Then I'll craigslist the card :)

I'm less concerned about price right now really; I'm not making a hardware investment of any sort, and the power draw from firing up these cards isn't going to be significant in any way.  I figure I might as well join in on the mining party before the next couple of difficulty bumps.
the MTGox clusterfuck shouldn't have any impact on the rate with which the various pools mine &amp; payout (in bitcoin) their members, right?  Isn't it just that the actual cash value of the bitcoins may not be worth as much as it has been?
I have my miners pointed at slush's pool right now, but as it's fairly popular and crowded, I'm wondering if it would be more profitable to join a different pool.

I think the problem is that they *do* have a clue, and they're terrified by the thought of a financial platform that they *can't* control.
