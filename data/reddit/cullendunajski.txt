The US government has 140,000 bitcoins from the closure of the Silk Road. The government doesn’t like lossing their moneys, even the magical digital variety

Look across this thread and you’ll find multiple points and articles on why bitcoin is thriving In this early age. But if you want something simple go to coin market cap and print out bitcoins gains over the year, or the 600billion market cap we just hit

I upvoted. You Sherlock Holmes the shit out of him

Same here, but you still have to be glad you had the freedom as a young lad to do ridiculously stupid things like that. Hell, I could have done a lot of positive things for the world back then, but the fact I was able to waste it away is somehow comforting to me. Maybe those drugs did mess me up a little too much rofl

My man we were in the same boat. I don’t regret it though, made some good money and got some good cannabis out of it!

Love to hear a response as well, thanks in advance community
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:20:26
Because I thought I thought I was as well. It was only through the advise of many of the experienced members here did I realize how our fears have no basis in reality when you see the historical trend of what bitcoin is accomplishing. 
I know you hear it probably everywhere, but wait a month and see you’re tears turn to glee.

Love to hear your ample research to support that

Give him a break. His dad had sex with his mom. That could make anyone pretty bitter about the world.
