merchants who think the value will continue to rise have no problem accepting it as a currency, because they know the vast majority of people still use fiat, and it's a risk they're willing to take. as adoption becomes more widespread, it will stabilize. large influx of demand and a limited supply has driven the price to where it is now. this supply and demand will eventually find equilibrium. at some point people will find it more palatable/less risky to offer goods/services for BTC.

Inflation is the fall of purchasing power, requiring more supply to accomplish the same thing. Because supply is fixed, BTC, by definition, cannot inflate. It can drop in value, but that still doesn't constitute inflation because supply cannot be increased beyond the set limit.

Death of net neutrality scares me, especially since I'm trying to build a book business, so I fully support it, don't get me wrong, and its death will only hurt efforts to improve healthcare, but I was never arguing taking funds that would go to NN and instead donate them to medical research, I was opposing the notion that this medical research shouldn't be pursued because it may also benefit a particular group of people. If it dies here, hopefully the cancer doesn't spread. In the long run, I don't see it staying dead, in any case. I can imagine some kind of decentralized network, or something like Elon Musk's network of satellites. A lot of big players are invested in keeping net neutrality alive and I don't think they're going to take it lying down. My eyes would be on google doing something, maybe casting a wider fiber net (and I'm sure plenty would happily contribute to this fund).
EDIT: Just noticed the first coin went to EFF. What are some other prominent charities fighting for net neutrality?

When I first learned of SENS I had a similar approach to yours, in part because commenting on the internet and raising awareness was the most effective thing I was capable of doing at the time, and got easily burnt out and therefor frustrated dealing with the same arguments over and over again. Now, my main focus is building a [business]( which will hopefully have a not insignificant impact over the years on this research. I've gotten in enough arguments like yours with opponents to know the approach doesn't work, and that other supporters cringe upon seeing it.

I'm pretty sure I understood your comment just fine, but maybe I didn't. Maybe I'm retarded, but if you understand your own argument well enough, you should be able to quickly break it down for me.

Can you explain what millennials not having health care (plenty of non-millennials don't either, btw) has to do with saving boomers from aging to death? What is the distinction between younger and older generations when it comes to being able to afford health care? Don't you think later generations might condemn this one to the same degree you do boomers? Do you see why I think this kind of thing is pointless and helps nothing? 
If the decision were entirely in your hands, and these treatments were developed and released tomorrow, and easily distributed to everyone, would you condemn boomers to suffer cancer, Alzheimer's, heart disease, and death?

"inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.[1] When the price level rises, **each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money**"
if there weren't such high demand for BTC, then it could be disinflationary, but since demand is driving the value per unit up, it isn't, and it's really too volatile at this point to be disinflationary anyway.

how does a lack of universal health care translate to cessation of medical research? don't you think these cheaper alternatives might make such a thing more feasible, or at least harder for those against it to deny it already is? don't you think more people would be rallying for it if not doing so meant they'd be condemned to an early and painful death?

Now I think I finally understand your argument, but I guess I put higher priority on medical research than net neutrality. I don't see a single Bitcoin as making the difference between it surviving or not on this kind of short timescale, whereas that same BTC, especially if held for a while, could have substantial benefit in basic medical research, which is very cheap, relatively speaking, and will have snowballing effects on a larger timeframe spanning decades, which is how long this stuff is going to take.

the thing about anti-aging therapies is everyone is a customer, indefinitely. that market absolutely dwarfs any other where only a relatively small percentage are affected, and eventually die. the amount of money brought in by these new medicines (a paradigm shift) will be astronomical. there is government incentive to prevent disease rather than treat it. it's cheaper, it leads to a more productive population, and it stops people from putting a bullet in your head when you're standing at a podium explaining why you think they should suffer a slow, debilitating decline when they don't have to.

my point is that by trying to halt this research to cut off one generation, you're greatly risking the lives of everyone who was born later than them. more importantly, everyone is a boomer to a younger generation. us millenials will be hated for some other reason. we always want to blame those who came before us for fucking things up, but we'll make our own mistakes. when we're young, we don't know much, and are more easily manipulated. when we're older, we know a little more, are generally wiser, but no longer have the time or energy to really make a difference. a population with an average age measured in centuries would be a lot less naive. 
it's important to understand what is meant by "curing" aging. to be against this idea is to support the continued existence of heart disease, Alzheimer's, cancer, etc. [there is no meaningful distinction.](

@_date: 2017-12-14 15:41:21
The wiki you linked doesn't mention disinflation. You don't need a reduction in supply for there to be deflation, just a fixed amount, and Bitcoin will be capped. Though there are still coins being mined, it is still deflating because demand is greater than supply and so the value (purchasing power) of each coin is rising. Disinflation is the reduction of inflation over time, but is still positive, and Bitcoin is not inflating at all. I think you're conflating a slowing increase of supply with disinflation, but the key thing is the value of said supply.

I don't agree with the way OP is going about things but the death by aging number aggregates age-related disease like Alzheimer's, heart disease, etc. as they're simply the later stages of various lifelong aging processes.
Population is booming in developing nations like India and China, and rapidly shrinking in highly developed ones like Japan. Some European countries rely on immigration to keep the workforce topped up. As technology improves, so does the carrying capacity of the earth. That said, at some point it'll likely be necessary to limit new births, once death by any cause is a rarity, which seems like a pretty good trade-off to me. Fixing menopause falls under the umbrella of "curing" aging, and with without this biological clock, women will be able to delay having children for decades longer than they do today. At some point, it could be required for parents to be at least a century old before fostering a child, and this would have added benefits of wiser parents. 
It's important to note that "curing" aging is no different than curing cancer, Alzheimer's, heart disease, sarcopenia, etc. The emphasis is on prevention and rejuvenation, to target the root causes of these processes before they progress to the point of severe illness. This is also a lot cheaper than treating people once they're already sick.

Why would you take bitcoin to a bank?
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:00:41
more marketplaces need to accept bitcoin before we see more widespread spending I think. for example, if Amazon were to jump on board, then it would surge in price, and I could see a lot of it being spent there directly instead of first converting it to cash. BTC hasn't yet stabilized because it is still not widespread enough.

be sure to print out your private and public keys on a piece of paper clearly visible to the camera before you record yourself eating it and subsequently pm me a private download link.

bit of a catch 22. there's no way Amazon jumping on board is not going to cause a surge in price. maybe this comes later when a lot of smaller retailers have already adopted it though and so while the surge may be $1000+, it would still be a smaller percentage than would be today.

it's scarce and therefore has an arbitrary, artificial value due to supply and demand. diamonds, on the other hand, are jacked up in price because they're hoarded by those in control of the mines.
