From what I've seen so far, I'm not convinced. I guess I just prefer non-intervention markets. The people speaking appear to have good intentions, but they don't seem to know about 'concentrated benefits, disbursed costs', or about 'privatized gains, socialized losses'. They seem rather smug and arrogant, and exclaim that their grand projects are easy with few details and lots of hand waving. They are not professional investment managers or project managers. Even Donald Trump's projects go bust sometimes, and he's lived his whole life doing that kind of stuff. Why should people be forced through taxes to invest in their projects? The politicians won't even be around when it completes, so there is no accountability if it fails. That's why central planning never works. 
Why do they even need a government for their projects anyways? If their projects and plans were so good, why can't they just publish it and ask people to invest for their own benefit and for the benefit of those they wish to help? If it's such a good project, people would be lining up to give him money and volunteering their labor. Why do they need to force it on people and take their money to build their dream?

The lamb and the wolf, Aesop's Fable
Once upon a time a Wolf was lapping at a spring on a hillside, when, looking up, what should he see but a Lamb just beginning to drink a little lower down. "There's my supper," thought he, "if only I can find some excuse to seize it." Then he called out to the Lamb, "How dare you muddle the water from which I am drinking?"
"Nay, master, nay," said Lambikin; "if the water be muddy up there, I cannot be the cause of it, for it runs down from you to me."
"Well, then," said the Wolf, "why did you call me bad names this time last year?"
"That cannot be," said the Lamb; "I am only six months old."
"I don't care," snarled the Wolf; "if it was not you it was your father;" and with that he rushed upon the poor little Lamb and ate her all up. But before she died she gasped out:

Not always if you secure a fixed rate loan in a low inflation period and hold it during a high inflation period. For example, if you secure a 30-year mortgage at 3% interest, I'm pretty sure inflation and real interest rates will go higher than 3% in 30 years. The bank doesn't care, because they flip it to the government (Fannie Mae) and let them eat the costs.

I would say their votes are worth more and counted first... you know... because of lobbying.
Not only that, but loan-holders (banks) are the first to benefit from inflation. They are the ones to surf the top of the wave. They get the money before anyone else does, so they can pay more wages / rent than others, and out-compete other industries. That is why banks always have the tallest skyscrapers in a city.

Banks thrive on inflationary dollars because they're the ones who get first use of those dollars over any other sector. They ride the wave of inflation. and yes, they can kill it, if they Lobby to make it a il legal and they prevent any transactions with any firm that has anything to do with bitcoins. individuals only recourse would be to trade trade cash for bit coin in person keeping the bitcoin economy very small.

Forever deflation might not be so good. If money deflates temporarily, then that is great! There's always a price low enough that someone will buy!
Perpetual deflation eliminates lending and credit, because the money you pay back will be always be worth more than the money you borrowed. The cost of the loan will be prohibitive. 
This prevents expansion when it could be most opportunistic, or advantageous. Think of a snake, and its meal. When a snake feeds, it bites off a little more than it could chew, and it stretches. That is like taking a loan out. It will digest that meal over time, like paying a loan off. Now if that snake couldn't stretch and could only eat what would exactly fit in its mouth, it would have to look much harder for a meal and might starve! That is the problem with perpetual deflation.
I predict another electro-currency will emerge (10-15 years) which will have a stable value based on the population. How this is achieved, I'm not sure. Perhaps the 'difficulty' would be adjusted based on the # of transactions (simulated GDP)? Or each client would enter the world's population and the network would take the average, to arrive at a # of currency units per capita, thereby remaining constant.
Regarding the computer analogy, people buy a computer to improve their means. A computer is an investment to obtain more money (indirectly through education, work, resumes, mining, etc.) A computer now represents a much better economic situation versus no computer or a computer 10 years from now. In actuality, my mom did really use that argument to avoid buying a computer ("I don't want to buy one now because they'll just get cheaper later.")

Not really. Companies have an army of people with one focus. Everyone is a professional and works on the goal and gets paid for it. Open source software is riddled with bugs. When you find one, good luck waiting for someone to fix it. Over many years, it can eventually be very efficient like Apache, but in the meantime, you are waiting for people to do things in their spare time.

they can't work with bitcoins because you can't create bit coins out of thin air. The reason it works for gold smiths is because the goldsmiths would issue their own banks notes which are paper, allowing fractional banking. of course that doesn't protect  them from a bank slash gold run.

The lamb and the wolf, Aesop's Fable
Once upon a time a Wolf was lapping at a spring on a hillside, when, looking up, what should he see but a Lamb just beginning to drink a little lower down. "There's my supper," thought he, "if only I can find some excuse to seize it." Then he called out to the Lamb, "How dare you muddle the water from which I am drinking?"
"Nay, master, nay," said Lambikin; "if the water be muddy up there, I cannot be the cause of it, for it runs down from you to me."
"Well, then," said the Wolf, "why did you call me bad names this time last year?"
"That cannot be," said the Lamb; "I am only six months old."
"I don't care," snarled the Wolf; "if it was not you it was your father;" and with that he rushed upon the poor little Lamb and ate her all up. But before she died she gasped out:

They (could) still have a copy of your wallet, and the private key. Many years from now, a hacker could obtain it from their servers and send your coins to their own address, while you thought they were locked up. You have to send the value to a wallet using the BTC client, then keep that wallet totally secure.
