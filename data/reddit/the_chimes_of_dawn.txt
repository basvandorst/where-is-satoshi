Lol, you have it exactly right, but did you say what you meant to say? If so, nice to see someone clear-headed enough to see where this is all going.
@_date: 2019-02-16 04:15:42
Lmfao, is this a Poe?
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:55:56
Hindsight is always clearest, but we can't go back in time. If wishes were horses, beggars would ride. You'll have ample reason to ponder that over these next few years.

So unique. So edgy. The rest of us fucking pawns just can't understand a rebel like you. It must be hard being so special. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:58:35
Nobody gives a rat's ass about proof of work.
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:10:57
Nobody will even be paying attention to Bitcoin in 2040, though. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:17:41
Don't worry, the shittyness of Bitcoin will make itself abundantly clear without any help. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 19:17:23
While I agree with your point, not all stocks pay dividends, or ever will, but that doesn't mean they aren't real investments.
@_date: 2018-11-23 19:13:52
For every seller, there has to be a buyer. So encouraging selling means you are expecting an equal amount of buying to take place. How do you expect that to happen without crashing the whole thing? Not that this is ever going to happen anyway. You are severely myopic if you think Bitcoin is ever going up again. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:13:08
You have absolutely no clue what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:05:01
You don't get it. Those groups are profiting NOW. And that's the end of it. Bitcoin is done, they've plundered it and all the fools on the ship with it. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 06:17:22
No. Ammunition and guns are real, tangible assets. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:03:37
Maybe because it's a big scam 
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:50:44
So everyone should sell at $40k, except you're going to sell at 80k? Okay, buddy. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:27:03
Thank you, I appreciate the explanation. Yes, I've also thought that the whole thing seems as though it will inevitably be consumed by bloat and pulled under by the weight of its own irrelevance and scammy nature. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 19:10:02
Dude, take a step back. You are living in a complete fantasy world you've constructed in your mind. The fact that you're planning this out as though it's actually going to happen is disturbing, and it has to be holding you back in your life. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:26:22
Lol. Yeah, it's sure storing value well. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 19:20:03
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:15:48
I agree, it's about as dumb as it gets. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:14:35
If Bitcoin would be dead if miners stopped mining, why won't Bitcoin be dead when miners stop mining because there are no more coins to be mined? Serious question. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:46:31
Lmfao. Do you actually think people don't know this? It's completely irrelevant. Nobody cares if some previous drop from $5 to 4 cents was a higher percentage. This time is completely different. The amount of value lost is greater by orders of magnitude. The potential market of suckers was completely saturated and the whole world learned about Bitcoin and cryptos. Now it's over. There are no more suckers to con into buying into this ridiculous scammy scheme.
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:57:10
Well said. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:56:25
Yeah, you have fun with that. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 19:18:37
I'd go even further and say actual investors never even touched it. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:01:25
Holy crap you're delusional. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:13:42
No, most have been saying "Bitcoin will die, and here's why" for 10 years, not "Bitcoin is already dead". It's been a long process, but it's in severe throes now. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 20:33:02
Were you born yesterday? On a turnip truck? Ever heard of Dutch tulips?
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:54:59
You are wrong. It will see below $100. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 19:16:17
Do you care what people call it with words when you lose every cent you've put into this pyramid scam?
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:52:27
Is this a Poe? Have you seriously swallowed this much Kool Aid?
Digital equivalent of gold? Is there a cryptocurrency for each metal? Which one is the equivalent of silver? Brass? Platinum?
@_date: 2018-12-08 00:57:44
You don't have to be stupid to make bad investments. Sone very, very intelligent people have made disastrous investment decisions. Isaac Newton lost a fortune by investing in the South Seas Company bubble, for example.
@_date: 2018-12-06 21:04:38
Right over your head
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:49:13
Thanks for the 2nd grade math lesson. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 00:37:23
Dream on. The spacecraft is crashing on impact.
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:56:49
Well said. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 00:48:09
What? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:06:54
He is right. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 20:43:26
People in this sub don't understand the concept of scaling. Patterns don't always scale, and very, very often they don't. Bitcoin movements on the smaller scale are not likely to repeat. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:10:14
Crypto was always done forever. These things take time to unwind and play out. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:20:07
There isn't going to be a "next bull market". The ride is over. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:35:37
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:12:20
This is delusional thinking. Just lol at thinking the "cycle" will repeat. This was just a decade-long scam that's finally in its end stage, terminal decline. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 17:18:13
Stupid post. Lots of wealthy, intelligent people have fancy cars and electronics. Including Warren Buffett. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:34:02
This. Also a no-coiner, but if you have 50k, and part of you wants to invest in this or has a FOMO, just put 5k in or something. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 05:59:15
How do you know?
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:38:20
Thank you, I agree. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:15:28
It won't, ever. It's done. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 00:42:02
Nobody wants to buy Bitcoin now. They've heard all the hype, seen their friends lose big, and want nothing to do with it (and never will).
