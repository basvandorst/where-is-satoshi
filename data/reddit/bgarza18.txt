Dip is gone and now I can buy, what a surprise
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:25:58
When panic sells happen, Coinbase/Gdax can never handle the traffic and their service goes down
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:20:06
Hahaha 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:03:33
I think you already missed the larger dip at ~$14k today
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:38:49
Set your limit orders and just hang on 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:08:57
Transfer from Coinbase to GDAX then to wallet and you won’t need to worry about the fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:07:09
Try Litecoin and Ethereum, bro
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:23:46
You misspelled trillionaire
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:41:05
What taxes, he hasn’t sold anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:51:12
Transaction fees *are* stupid high, Ive been holding off on moving my coins because of it. Can’t even move my own coins without paying out the wazoo for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:58:51
I don’t think so, you’re not losing coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:35:46
Aaand $15.4k
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:27:26
Five hours later....$14000
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:32:51
I think it’s only for a certain date range 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:37:58
So what exactly happens with these big moves like the ones we’ve seen today with big players tossing around millions. How does the market manipulation benefit them? Are they buying up then selling to move the price down then buy back in?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:51:44
Every time I see litecoin and Ethereum have a sudden jump, in suspicious that’s it’s being pumped by big players to drive down bitcoin then they buy back in, everything flips again. Rinse and repeat. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:01:42
I don’t understand what you believe you’re missing out on, are you trying to buy on coinbase then sell at a higher price on GDAX? Or are you trying to move the coins to a private wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:02:53
Get a coinbase account. Make a purchase. Use your coinbase credentials to open a GDAX account. Then go from there. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:02:42
What hahahaha the new Nigerian Prince
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:02:20
Coinbase is a good place for a newbie to start. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:46:31
Seriously. Buying the dip is impossible 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:23:27
Fiat. They can’t move $20 without losing it all to fees lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:08:07
What are you using to sell? Because if it’s Coinbase you won’t be able to log in lol 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:29:08
Yeah. I’m thinking about taking my earnings at 19k and peacing out. Already back to $15.8
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:13:11
All the time and because big holders buy and sell coins and it moves the market
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:19:18
When does that happen
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:47:08
Switched my buying to Gemini 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:43:52
The price might change, the amount of coins doesn’t.
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:19:21
I think people get banned or censored here all the time for complaining about terribly high transaction fees and such, which is weird. That’s all I see of the “beef.”
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:23:34
So remove the post? Not ban.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:14:53
My point, like I already said, is if it does what it says it set out to accomplish, how is it a “fraud.” 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:17:42
Hold on, BCH allows people to transact with a crypto currency with low fees and fast transaction completions. How is that a fraud? Sounds like it works. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:25:06
People are selling, it’s normal 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:49:56
Can do you stop loss on coinbase? Or is that only GDAX
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:16:31
This looks like on news, $7800 now lol 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:14:57
Coinbase is down lol 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:14:08
How is the technology going to be useful and viable if the fees are so high? Lose money by using it, it sucks. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:51:08
Move it to a wallet 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:59:36
Hold on to your butts 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:24:38
Same thing that always happens. People sell to drive the price down, buy to drive it up. Keep making money 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:20:58
Yes it is, because it’s dropping down to 9k
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:37:30
I did my duty and downvoted
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:17:33
All these transfers will incur a lot of fees, wouldn’t they?
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:50:51
What about Breadwallet? Didn’t they say they’d support the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:01:36
Isn’t this the sub where people get banned for showing any kind of support for bitcoin cash in their comments?
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:00:48
Gotcha, I would then own each coin correct?
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:06:32
How do you avoid a bunch of fees moving from GDAX to a wallet? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:04:10
I’ll have to revisit the topic in November then, I’m not savvy with the forks, I just buy and hodl 
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:12:55
Yeah, that coin. Isn’t this the sub where people get banned all the time? 
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:35:11
Just buy using fiat on amazon like you do right now. No need to be buying off of amazon anonymously. Use your crypto elsewhere 
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:34:57
Well that came out of nowhere 
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:34:54
I hate the articles that just describe what's happening, as if it means much 
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:03:07
What Are you using to set limit orders?
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:15:08
Oh man, you’re an awesome redditor for this. I’ll have an ear to the ground for your next generous mood, sir! I’d love to own a bitcoin.
