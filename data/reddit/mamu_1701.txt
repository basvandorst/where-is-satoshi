So... If you get (e.g. at Coinbase) the same amount of bitcoin you had on the old chain also on the new chain and these chains are not aware of the transactions which happen on their respective counterpart, did you just "doubled" you bitcoins, then?
This can't be true (right)?
Or is this exactly the reason for the increased bitcoin demand of the last couple of month (people think they double their money)?

At least in my imagination mirroring would be a necessary thing? If BC-A says '5 BTC are gone from me to other' and BC-B doesn't know this, I could spend these 5 BTC a second time as it would assume these 5 BTC are still belonging to my wallet address? No?
(CoinBase stated it will put BTC you had on the old BC also on the new BC)

Maybe stupid question: Transactions on one chain will be mirrored on the other chain, right?

How is this even possible? I'm still new to the topic so this sounds "to good to be true".
How could "they" create coins out of thin air?
How much worth will the new coin be (how will this be decided)?
How many of these new coins will "they" create (how will this be decided)?

Will the coins indeed "copied" or, as stated, "separated"?
Thx for your info!
