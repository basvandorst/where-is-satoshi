Lets say you did put $200 in btc at $2 (you hold 100btc). Last december, it was worth $1.7M. Then it goes down to 3500, and you are worth 350K, but you are still chilled? :p

Great review of the whole story of bitcoin. You deserve an upvote!
@_date: 2018-11-30 16:26:19
If I may ask. what's your average buying price to date, and how much of your net worth did you invest in?
@_date: 2018-11-30 16:53:32
Wow! Man you are all in. 
Good luck!
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:04:56
heard the same at 6k, 5k, 4k, and now 3k.   
Same story when we hit 3k and 2k...

Pfff, still repeating the same stuff again and again. Wake up guys. It was a niche at that time, no one knew about it. It is past mainstream now, a lot of people got burned, and most hate it now. So I am sorry to tell you that history will not repeat itself this time. Even mining is industrialised now, and there is 100s of more coins.
See you at 1k

Bitcoin will never recover to anywhere close to where it was, better get over it guys and save what you have left of your money

I hope you are not serious in what you are saying. "Institutions" are just watching bitcoin holders dump their bag on each others and wasting their hard earned money. These people are mostly poor and they made themselves even poorer.
You got involved in a scam (crypto), you lost money and you are trying to comfort yourself with all this BS. I feel bad for all the people that got burned, and who will be burned by this scam in the future.
Every get rich quick scheme is a scam, I hope you will not fall for the next one guys.
See you at 1k (where you will still be repeating the same BS)

Bitcoin doesnt work. You use bitpay fees that you wouldnt pay if you use a debit card (at least in europe). You are just adding another layer of fees as merchants have no interest in holding to such a volatile coin. 
Why would you pay 2$ for a usb cable in ebay and keep track of the transaction om the blockchain for the next 100 years?!
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:39:36
Spot on! that's the reason why I shorted at 6k
@_date: 2018-12-09 12:50:20
Haha, i am already deep in the green shorting that scam. So you can call me whatever you like.
The truth is a lot of people lost their money im this scam, thinking that "institutions" will come so they can dumo their bag on them.
You might be from the few who bought early, but the reality is that 90% of holders are in the red right now and they would have been better off not throwing their money away

I  shorted at 6.2k and I am going to buy back my short at around 1k. There is no rocket fuel as it is past mainstream and the tech is nothing special, just a non modifiable distributed database. 
Do you really need to know in 10 years that you paid your croissant for 80p to the bakery around the corner? Thats the issue with bitcoin, it is not a currency, just a glorified database. And it is slow, and inflation goes through the roof each time you do a fork or each scammer create a new coin.
I did my research and I am very confident on my trade, and I will see you at 1k (when you will be still repeating the same narrative)
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:23:47
People lost 90% of their money and you tell them to hold?! The more I read this thread the more it convince me to stick to my short all the way to 0!
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:07:10
Seems like the shorts are enjoying the day while you are holding your bags
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:45:31
Yes, you can but on the short side, you will make more shorting this market
@_date: 2018-12-09 11:00:28
So if someone think btc is useless he is a troll?
