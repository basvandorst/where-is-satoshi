Several decades implies more than 2 we're talking 30 + years.  By then I want to assume and hope that since it's open source, lots of innovations might be added to make it 'last' longer.  Good question though.  'It can last several decades' , since when are currencies ever expected to last several decades instead of hundreds of years

Performed a much needed update on the website.  Working internally on multiple tutorials which will be released sometime next week.  Updates will be coming a bit slow in the coming month, due to a new bitcoin project I've been invited to be a part of.
Optimized site for mobile viewing.

New tutorials coming soon.  We are currently working on transfering to our new webhost.  Our current one sure made a mess of things.  Hosted forum in the works too.
