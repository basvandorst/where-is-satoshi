If I have the seed to my wallet it will always be there? I can be worry free? I have tried to uninstall and reinstall it multiple times not working at all I deleted all the electrum files on my computer so yea I deleted my wallet but in theory I should be able to download electrum and reopen my wallet with my seed? 
Also I am on a Mac but it won't open the program at all not sure if it has to do with my computer tho it kinda reset I guess the other day because my Firefox was fucked up and and completely reset and that never happened before so all my bookmarks were deleted and my whole internet history
@_date: 2015-07-12 01:45:47
thank you unfortuantelly already lost one not a big bet tho but i was wrong im not that mad even tho the scorecard was way closer then shoulda been we could be in for a night of odd decisions

isnt coinbase a website could that in theory mean they could just shut down and steal everything or am i just paranoid or dont understand what coinbase is thats the only reason i use electrum over coinbase with the key feature isnt it nearly impossible for me to lose my Btc?
