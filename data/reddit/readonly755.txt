Well, we can't 'solve' anything, we just optimize and make different trade-offs. Schnorr signatures should improve fungibility, so should Lightning.
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:52:32
The mechanism isn't different to the Lightning Network. You lock in funds in one place, i.e. Bitcoin Main chain and make them available in another place, like LN or side chain.
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:33:36
I share your concern but I estimate that this will be manageable in 10 years. I think Bitcoin Main Chain will be the 'master node' you speak of. The side chains will take the load of less important data, referencing to specific segments fo the Main Chain.
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:37:37
True, every potential side chain is ICOing elsewhere. However, we only got SegWit 6 month ago and without it, it was technically not feasible.

I think much of the misinformation stems from people who want to push their altcoin with bigger blocks. Double spending is actually really simple if you run Bitcoin Core, just right-click on the transaction and select "abandon transaction". Now you can use the inputs for a new one.
You should figure out a way to get your coins off the compromised machine before doing anything else though. If you have the private keys backuped it's probably a good idea to start from scratch and format the whole computer once you have restored your wallet elsewhere.
For example, I have a virtual machine (e.g. VirtualBox) that has an installation that is only used for the Bitcoin wallet. It's not as save as a separate computer but it is much harder for malware to sneak into it.
Overall, I fear that many enthusiasts are forgetting that computers are rather strange things to most people.

We can always hard fork but realistically, we can't until a serious attack occurs that renders the old chain useless. - Long-term, I hope that side chains will solve this and allow for better update opportunities.

@_date: 2017-12-12 00:10:53
Very good. To be safe in the future, you can also generate a 'raw transaction' and don't send it with the wallet.
Instead, go to another computer and decode the transaction for example here: 
If everything is correct, there is no way that this transaction can be manipulated. You can broadcast it than on the website.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:31:36
Not true, I do it regularly, it is easy if you run your own node. If you have doubts you can also push the tx on many websites, it will definitely get into the mempool and if the fee is sufficient a miner will pick it up.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:33:00
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:04:49
If it has 'some confirmations' it is most likely finalized. If it is just in the mempool, it can still be 'double-spend'.
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:09:45
Sure it can. Just not on-chain.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:18:20
Well, you can try. Make a small donation to Andreas or Wikipedia or to whatever cause you feel strongly about and use very low transaction fees. Now try to abandon the transaction in your wallet, like Core or Armory and create a new transaction, directing it elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:37:00


This is a myth. I don't know where it originated, but your transaction will almost never 'expire' or disappear. Why do I know that? I keep every transaction in my mempool and push them again regularly. So if your transactions makes it into my mempool, it will never disappear.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:07:05
This is silly. Bitcoin is the core of a future value network. It doesn't need to respond to the short-term demand of poorfags. It needs to ensure long-term survival, that is it's valued propositions.
Additional layers will provide ample bandwidth. If coinbase would just stop sabotaging bitcoin and implement SegWit transactions would be much cheaper.

It's remarkable. The hard fork people are a little reminiscent of creationists that want to "teach the controversy." - Segwit is ready and solves those problems except the desire for power of an entrenched elite elected by sortition. arguments only work on people with unarticulated views in that it tries to put up a front of credibility for their snake oil.
I just struggle to understand the motivation. Are they deeply invested into an altcoin portfolio like Roger Ver? In that case, destoying Bitcoin would probably give them the control they crave in form of Dash or some other centralized alt coin.

@_date: 2017-03-18 16:48:39
I think a discussion about network security is really overdue and much more important than transaction fees. may be at something here but I feat the incentives are not really aliened as miners would risk their capital investment.
We should recognize that a hard fork is probable at some point and have something ready that can be deployed.
As we are at it, maybe we can also get rid of some other technical debt and even add some improvements that would otherwise be unattainable. Something like a Day-X hotfix that is merged into the core client and can be activated manually without installing a new version.
As for PoS, there are clear arguments for it and there are clear arguments against it. To me, the most critical one is that Internet penetration globaly should be at a point where it is more ubiquitous (5G, google fiber, etc.) and projects like Freedome box and Urbit are readily available.

One does not simply change bitcoins rules. This applies in particular to Developers, Presidents, Kings or Princes.
Also, there is a process in place, its precondition is the total annihilation of the current protocol. At this point in time, it is unlikely that this will happen on a voluntary basis.
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:56:38
That depends on the degree of centralization. If the government can get his hand on a sizeable part of the miners and coin holders you can expect those people to become very vocal to implement some 'small change' that doesn't affect anybody else. Especially because the alternative is a hard fork which would be an enormous cost to the network with zero cost for the goverment.
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:23:56
That is the beauty of soft forks, we don't need to discuss them because they are, by definition, backwards compatible. I can safely ignore any added feature, they have no "ramifications down the line".
I am happy with a multitude of people that agree on a multitude of rules between themselves. It's not on me to tell people how to decorate their blockchain.
I am not happy with people who infringe on the agreed upon terms of the protocol, like my guaranteed RIGHT to 1MB blocks. - Otherwise, I would never have entered into any relationship with Bitcoin.

The UTXO model makes this very ugly. You are essentially creating a second class Bitcoin, shall we call it Lightcoin :) that sits on top of the normal Bitcoin and is not entirely fungible as you acknowledge in Method 1. You could just trade your Bitcoin for Lightcoin directly and take advantage of the cheaper blockspace there. You can hedge the risk with a short position in Lightcoin, essentially transacting in Bitcoin-hedged-lightcoins.
Method 2 is essentially the lightning network. 
- SegWit has you covered. Though, there are probably good ways how you could use SegWit to create essentially Unlimited blocks, even with a higher frequency that need only confirmation from a subset of miners.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:53:59
(c). If (a). happens holdouts decide to "follow the stubborn miners chain" and actively disregard all SegWit blocks (or set a new VersionBit) causing a permanent split.
I think we have bigger problems on our hands because this strategy opens the door for legislators to force every entity they can get their hands on to support future soft forks that enable regulation.
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:19:14
Gladly, maybe we can also work on a solution to segregate the mempool.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:19:08
I think this is a probable outcome. It would effectively mean a split.
- Now that the cat is out of the bag, I don't see why subsets of the community would not choose this option to split off. The only trouble with such a split is that weak chains could be subject to attacks, if the mining power behind is too limited it could probably be brought to a halt (with merged mining?).
What if a 3rd party were to legislate a certain soft fork into existence and forces all large entities like miners and exchanges into supporting this specific version?
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:07:29
That is all good and well but I think we may not get sidechains as we won't have SegWit. 
Pair also states "Upon seeing widespread adoption of the new rules in the network, miners begin an activation process." -That is wishful thinking, miners may not activate anything as we just learn with SegWit. 
My idea was to basically partition the network as it is. That doesn't require any sort of fork [here](
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:31:02
I guess that would be a non-cooperative close. That could take some time, possibly 1000 confirmations.
You can still broadcast the pre signed transaction form your counterparty if you would keep this transaction online through a third party. Of course, the 3rd party could use it to annoy you.
@_date: 2017-03-14 08:36:04
A valid Bitcoin transaction to me is what my node accepts as such. If you don't have Bitcoin, use shapeshift to convert. That goes for all BTC forks, whether Dash or Roger-Dash or whatever you call their new version.
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:35:54
Actually, you got me thinking. Here is a way that could work.
Imagine a new client: Super Bitcoin. 
It implements Bitcoin Core as is but differs in one way. Everybody who runs this client and mines Bitcoin sends those Bitcoin to a specific address.
Here is the twist. On top of the old rules, there are new rules that ONLY AFFECT THOSE NEW COINS. They are held as collateral by the Super-Bitcoin-Net and a new transaction type is used to transact with those coins in a new space.
This is not visible to Core Clients, they can only see the locked in Bitcoins at the specific address. 
Now we have an 'Over-Block' that only exists for Super Clients, if there is any disagreement, those coins can be spent in the normal block space. However, the 'Over-Block' space could be governed by different rules like BU, XT or Dash.
It would allow different communities to form and create their own version of Bitcoin. As long as there is a safe way to move coins between both chains there is little ambiguity. Of course, if there are only a few miners supporting the over-block space they could easily collude.
It's not as pretty as a blocksize increase or SegWit and certainly slower because the participants need to build trust, but it opens the door for competition. Miners could slowly roll that out and move coins into the new space. The more that integrate it, the more secure it would become.
If it was eventually supported by 100% of the network the Core Client could actually subsume the new rules. That would allow for a soft fork that would be "strictly expanding" instead of "strictly reducing" as Buterin would say. (Of course, insanely slow)
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:01:12
Interesting that you bring it up. I think it is actually a good onramp for small amounts. You would be paying a hefty spread and Amazon doesn't really work in Brazil ... never mind the extra tax and horrible exchange rate you get for foreign put purchases.

Frankly, your best shot is in asking somebody from abroad to assist you. If you don't know anybody, try Couchsurfing or the like. You can meet foreigners there and those who travel to Iran may actually also understand Bitcoin and are happy to assist.
Once you know somebody you will likely be able to just exchange some rial. This person can use any exchange outside with his or her bank account. Make sure to get at least 0.03 BTC, better 0.05. This is important because on Bisq, formerly Bitsquare you need to provide some collateral to open a trade.
Monitor Bisq and see if a trade comes up, you can likely use your bank account to settle.
You want to use Electrum as the wallet. Don't bother with phone wallets or the like, it's not like you are going to buy a coffee with those coins. Make sure you have a backup and use a password!

It is remarkable that this discussion is still going on. I think you should just go back to Lejitz paper and read it again, all answers are in there. - Very well writen by the way.
I personally was a little spooked during the summer last year and remember thinking hard about this issue. Finally I arrived at the conclusion that I don't need to worry about immutability, because I can make a decision.
My decision was to not mine a fork or verify any bigger blocks. 
I also sanitized my node to not wast bandwidth with non conforming nodes. In addition I explored a fake-fork whereby I would signal willingness to fork XT only to revert back the moment the first bastard-block is born as a countermeasure to the attack attempted by Hearn.
Since last summer, there is no discussion, you guys are like Mormons knocking at doors, trying to convert people. - It will never happen. Really.
Your arguments are informed by a very different vision of Bitcoin. I don't even think of it as money, heck money is not even a noun I would use anymore.
Bitcoins blockchain is the most constant place in the known universe! Even if the planet implodes, I'd say there is a good chance that a copy of Bitcoins blockchain will survive. You argue about buying coffee, inflation or wannabe Paypal, to me, there will be people born and die without ever transacting on-chain, not because they aren't interested in Bitcoin, but because they don't matter enough. 
This is not to say you can't fork, I implore you people, Bitcoin is open source, call it what you want, configure it how you see fit. Change the hashing function when you are at it too. All good with me, just don't try to attack Bitcoin.
PS: Here is a secret, there is inflation; 21 Mio. isn't the end and I see that being a problem around block 13,440,000, seriously. - But I don't expect to argue about that this century.

No, sorry. I read it, it's worthless and he misses the point.
Think about it this way, 'what is the economic cost of mining a block?'
Now you have a free market again!

I agree, utility and ideological value are hard to separate. A substrate of ideology is in all of the ongoing experiments. An interesting contribution in this respect is probably Steve Waldman's Soylent Blockchains.  
In the end, they are all made of people.


The decentralized ideology is what gives it utility which gives it value. You have it exactly right with Monero.


Well said. It depends on the thread model that 'informs' your choices. Having been born in a totalitarian country leads me price decentralization (dependability) much higher than cheaper transaction (convenience). Only time will tell.

I think you are right in that 2x coin will emerge at some point. But it will be in a category with Bitcoin Gold (and should eventually move ahead of Bcash).

The honest thing to do is moving them into another wallet, and post the address somewhere so somebody can find you and claim the fund by proving that this person has the private keys to the address they came from.

In theory, you could have gotten the keys to somebody else's wallet, but the chances are really really really slim. I mean you are going to win the lottery a couple thousand times in a row before that happens.
More likely is that Exodus fucked up and you got access to some sort of default wallet that is used by somebody else. Parity (ethereum) had similar bugs.

No. In cases where there is no clear guidance, most jurisdictions have applicable general norms.
Your Bitcoin transaction is, if not explicitly exempt, certainly treated as a form of (non-monetary) property, or as a form of currency.
In case of property, the use of bitcoin to purchase goods or services would result in the recognition of gains or losses (this applies also to investment purposes). The character of the gain or loss would depend on the applicable rules in the relevant jurisdiction, for example, whether the property is defined to be a capital asset, the length of holding period, or the classification of a transaction as speculation.
Given your bitcoin is treated as a currency, most jurisdictions require the recognition of foreign exchange gains or losses.
Almost every transaction should be declared! Nobody cares about those illegal transactions because there aren't that many of them.


In other words: "There shouldn't be traffic on the high way during rush hour, and if there is, it's unfair that some people have money to fly a helicopter." - The block space is a scarce resource, its price dependents on supply and demand. You can wait, or you can pay.




It is not evident to me that it has no utility in its current form. I for one do not speculate on bitcoin ever becoming a useful currency. I expect it to be a settlement layer with pristine censorship resistance.

I said "most" bitcoin transactions are illegal. How many of today's 304,226 transactions will be declared? They are illegal because people don't declare them. Evidently! They only get away with it because bitcoin is censorship resistant.


I claim that Bitcoin is only censorship resistant because it is so nimble and the blockchain is not bloated with millions of micro-transactions that would also increase regulatory scrutiny.

Sounds like they are still fine. Use the private key and import the wallet into Electrum. - Otherwise, we would need more info to make a forensic assessment. (Though, you should probably not post this on Reddit.)
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:38:54
Yes. That is what we call the "seed". A deterministic wallet like Electrum derives all addresses from this seed. They are all unique to your seed.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:42:55
That sounds like a pretty complex undertaking. What makes you think a think a softfork suffices?

In fact, I know somebody who covers about 10% of his expenses in BTC. He is planing on getting to 12-15% next year.
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:08:07
Even if 90% of today's transactions would be from one pocket to another. That leaves more than 30000 on the table. 
In the UK as well as in the US, it is necessary to calculate and report gains and losses on each use or disposition of bitcoins. The exemption has nothing to do with the fact that you have to declare it. You must have never been audited. The IRS states this specifically. Despite this, very few gains/losses have been declared.
- If you think that Bitcoin is not used to evade taxation, we can simply agree to disagree and leave it with that.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:48:45
No, of course not. Send me your income statement, your latest tax filing, and the usual KYC details and I will charitably cover the transaction costs.
Obviously, other people don't mind to pay more fees in exchange for a quick on-chain confirmation.
On a less sarcastic note, most Bitcoin transactions are illegal in most jurisdictions. E.g.: circumvent exchange and capital controls, AML/KYC, not paying VAT, have to be accounted for as barter and reported (!) etc. The legislator will find it necessary to extend regulation to network participants beyond exchanges if this would be too pervasive, i.e. if more people would transact in those early days (yes, you are very very early!). 
- Currently, it's only good for hodling and people shouldn't be incentivized to use it for anything else (spare emergencies).
Once penetration is more extensive, we can slowly increase the utility (as we do already with SegWit!).
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:04:12
In Europe you pay different prices depending on the payment method. EC card can save you 15€ in comparison to credit card. There is no 'cash back' scam there either.

Some more info: 
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:25:40
Well, you could have had this easier.
You don't really need to move the funds as you have the original client running (and there is replay protection). This is more or less a precaution in case you use the Electrum version for BCash (as it could have a backdoor).
As you are already there and in case you want to be extra safe, just rename your wallet.dat to wallet.dat_old, restart bitcoind and it will create a new wallet.dat. You can now receive funds in the new wallet. Copy the receiving address, shut bitcoind down. Load the 'wallet.dat_old' as wallet.dat again (make sure the new one is backed up and safe) and transfer all funds to the new address.
Now you can import the 'wallet.dat_old' into PC and send the Bcash to shapeshift.

People only run this client until segwit is activated, or do you think this will be merged into core or other implementations?
Think about it this way, a miner could also switch off his equipment for the time and spin it up afterwards, once people migrated to another core client like 0.15 and version bits will be used as before. - the miner wouldn't need to implement any change.
Only random clients, supposedly without much hashing power could fork off. Yet, this wouldn't be in their interest as they just wanted to activate segwit which presumably happend already.
@_date: 2017-04-13 22:49:48


Yes. What is the best response towards a non-rational actor?
Think about it this way: You are stuck in a room with a zombie. Would you like to lock the door from the inside or the outside? 
UASF means we run to the door and try to close it from the outside. If the zombie becomes trustworthy, we can open the door slowly again (after 15 days).

That does not follow. Think about it this way, the city generally permits smoking, however, some people soft-fork and decide that there is no smoking allowed around their block.

@_date: 2017-04-12 13:12:14


That does not follow. You would need to show that you can't build a non-segwit block on a segwit block.
I know that newer core clients may not propagate blocks to older implementations but that could be bridged easily. Also, it is already bridged by the fact that clients like BCoin seem to peer both ways.
Only the BU implementation rejects certain blocks, there is no technical reason for why they can't change that.
You could have 3 forks, Old nodes, SegWit nodes and BU nodes ... however, it's not very likely because it is already bridged (never mind xthin).

It's a soft fork. A group of people could also signal for Santa Claus, as long it does not change the current rules there is no issue. If activated, non-segwit blocks are just as valid as they are now.
The 95% threshold was nonsenses, ... the developers just didn't think that anybody would seriously block it.

@_date: 2017-04-12 15:50:55
Granted, I have conflated both. However, you can still construct non-segwit blocks with the version number to pass the test. - It is a response to the unfortunate decision to require a 95% activation threshold.
I think the community is split already, with UASF miners have the choice to include classic blocks into the blockchain by using the right VersionBits and avoid a hard-fork without losing anything.
From here it follows that they must provide an argument for why they think that others shouldn't have the right to use SegWit.
I can't think of any good argument that would not imply maliciousness. - The BU faction already uses dirty tricks.
Again, we are held hostage, they are free to not include SegWit transactions afterward. What do they stand to lose?
@_date: 2017-04-11 18:21:50

Afterward, the version bit does not matter anymore. A miner that does not like this proposal can (1) set the versionBit and just continue or (2) not mine for 15 days. - No hard-fork occurs.

No, you are not giving yourself a loan, the bank gives you a loan. It's a racket because the rates are outrageous. A debit card works exactly the same way, you just get your bank to alot you credit and if your balance is below zero, you get a loan. 
In fact, the same bank may offer you a visa card and a debit card but the interest on the Visa card is naturally higher.
Cash back is a way to motivate people to use the cards more which is being payed by mearchents who in turn increase prices. This of course falls disproportionatly onto smaller merchants because larger ones receive higher discounts.

It's all speculation. The point of Bitcoin is just that you can't get the root of it and force it into some corset (easily).
Don't forget that societies run on shared hallucinations. The most resilient ones, such as gold, will outlast the less resilient ones like paper monies.

Well, on a spectrum, everybody is a refugee sometimes. You could be a tax refugee for example. I also visited camps of refugees from the middle east and can confirm your observation, they are not yet computer literate enough to understand crypto, never mind able to protect a private key. However, those who are aren't in camps which goes to show that adoption there is probably just a matter of time. It's lagging 10 years.

The problem is that pruning works only if you start new. The node will switch to normal mode as soon as 'fastsync' reaches the top of the blockchain. If you want to stick with 15GB you have to delete it after a month and sync again ... I tried, it sucks, it still takes a day to sync back up pruned to the current state. Never mind that you are a leech to the network.
This is not a workable solution.

Point in case ... I remember running into an older lady and she managed to setup an account on a random computer and happily accepted Bitcoin outright, cleared the cache and walked away.

The whole arrangement would probably never transcend your local trust network. Say you are my neighbor and you need a short term loan for the newest iPhone.
You, I and probably other people would have a multisig arrangement that works automatically and transfers my funds to you. I would give you credit so to speak, according to some variables.
I know, you think that's crazy, but it's actually rather simple. I have an account with a bank where I have cash invested in short and midterm bonds ... so called cash equivalents that pay me 0.5% to 1.5% p.a.
Now if I need some money I basically sell 1 or 2 BTC worth of bonds and can have immediate liquidity.
In our Bitcoin future, I would sell some and give you, say 0.1 BTC. In return you pay me a premium over short-term interest rate, say 1-2% assuming your payment history indicates that you have meet your obligations regularly and because you are my neighbor (you can't just run away).

"A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved."

I don't think adoption is slowing. I think it is still accelerating. Reddit or any legal US business is not a good proxy for Bitcoin adoption.
Bitcoin solves a trust issue. In a high trust society that's like opening a lemonade stand next to a Fanta factory. Nobody cares about our lemonade, except the usual hippies that are happy to pay extra for organic stuff due to higher motives.
The story is different in other places where they only sell warm piss to the people. The problem there is that people are a) very used to the piss and b) don't have a bottle opener.
Look at social media, in a society with reasonable freedom it's not rocking the boat. In a dictatorship it causes revolutions. Bitcoin will have a similar effect once it sinks in. At some point, this will feed back to Reddit.

Divest into Bitcoin for a higher reason. E.g. you could buy company stock of solar companies to save the environment. I always place an order when I am frustrated with some centralized system that would be redundant if Bitcoin catches on. E.g. $6 fee to withdraw cash abroad is frustrating, so I buy some Bitcoin as an act of silent protest. Have to provide extra documentation to make a silly little bank transfer? My response: buy a little Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:30:30
It's not workable because accepting one alt over another just creates more confusion at this point. Atomic swaps will lead to the acceptance of everything that has a liquid market, ... confusing people with a Bitcoin clone makes no sense at this point, especially as it doesn't solve any of Bitcoins problems (Litecoins Nakamoto coefficient is worse than BTCs). If you want to expand choice fall back on a useful not centralized platform ... Monero would make much more sense as it adds a layer of anonymity.

BTC has more moneyness than USD(Debit/Deposit). I think OP forgot to differentiate USD(Cash) from USD(Deposit). I would argue that CHF/EUR(Cash) comes probably more handy, less inflation, higher denomination and reasonably easy to exchange.
I think your conclusion really depends on location. Also figuring out your exchange rate will probably require some sort of electronic device. I'd say everything Bitcoin needs is ubiquitous (I checked my emails in the middle of the Sahara), but of course, you can always contend this with constructing some scenario, no need to quarrel.

@_date: 2018-04-06 13:49:35


Because the dollar was pegged to gold.
The preference was clear: gold &gt; dollar &gt; deposit receipt.


You basically argue that "people" had "wrong" preferences. Saving over consumption, liquid assets over illiquid assets. I would argue the market would have cleared that eventually.
The only real problem, that you point out so pointedly, with reference to penny candies is divisibility. A technical issue that Bitcoin has overcome.


In other words, if an investment has a negative return (9%-10%=-1%) it should not be realised. What we see today, with negative interest rates is very similar in that the government tries to manage the economy through price manipulation.

Interestingly enough, we could probably argue small amounts of USD(cash) have a higher moneyness than small amounts of BTC(MainChain) but as the amount increases portability, etc. decreases.
Further USD(Coin) has a much worse moneyness because you can't even exchange them and nobody outside the US accepts them (not accepted at exchange booth).
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:57:28
Yeah, now that I thought some more about it I think that you can't compare them one to one at all.

**Stocks** Seriously? Weren't we talking about bubbles? What's the current P/E ration again? 
- I am divesting here.
**Bonds** Why would I use my capital to prop up the states that actively work against the interest of their tax cattle? Especially for a zero yield? (Except for some credit that isn't worth the hassle)
- I am divesting here.
**Cash** I wouldn't hold more than necessary. Keep many open channels to liquidate Bitcoin if necessary.
During times of instability ("doomsday"), evolution favors those who can innovate and be frugal. Further, flexibility, languages and plenty of passports will do wonders and are well worth investing in. - Forget those jokers with Rambo knife and a Krugerrand up their sleeve.

Genius. I haven't thought about it. They really have no reasonable avenue open.
Edit: Actually it can be compatible. A miner really needs to signal only a version bit, they don't even need to support SegWit itself. It's backward compatible.

Say you are in Brazil right now, you have some Bitcoin, would still recommend the same?
You sell 1000 Reais, pay your tax, the spread, the exchange fee and the transaction fee. Now you buy back in 9 months, provided the USD price of bitcoin has gone down by 50%.

This is disingenuous. The majority does not need to support, use or like SegWit. We only ask them to activate it for those who would like to use it. It is backward compatible. We do not threaten but merely state that a person that denies another person an advantage without loosing any of their legitimate interest themselves is not a person we would like to associate with after the 1st of August.
An analogy would be a prohibition on people planting carrots in their own garden. I ask you not to plant carrots in your garden nor do I want you to like carrots I only would like to plant carrots (SegWit) in my own personal garden and you deny me this right for no reason.

@_date: 2017-05-13 21:52:15
You want to introduce an OP_CODE to extent users equity by allowing them to choose miners. - I think that your reasoning is flawed because you want to change the consensus protocol layer (that is of a higher order) while a change to the peer-to-peer protocol layer would suffice.
In order to create the same outcome with much more flexibility on the peer-to-peer protocol layer, a user could simply broadcast the signed transaction to a specific memepool that could be advertised by miners. This would allow for different markets to form, instead of shoehorning some odd liability into the core implementation that will be abused. 
Your own words: "Wallets SHOULD NOT use this feature except for softforks with widespread support from the economy. Doing so prematurely risks effectively bribing miners to cause a chain split with false signalling."

@_date: 2017-05-19 16:57:30
I don't think that there are any miners left on the sideline.
What we really need are coinholders to short BU. The problem is that Roger Sports, Jihan and Co. are few and know each other. They can coordinate much more efficiently.
What we really need to know is how much capital they will be able to deploy. I wonder if somebody has played that through in a game-theoretic manner.
What if they frontload the exchanges and short Bitcoin early on, creating the impression that the economic majority is behind them? What if they hold back and let the price drop, pretending they have no economic majority and only hold a floor around USD100 and deploy the majority of their capital a week later after scooping up a million coins just to swing the pendulum back?

@_date: 2017-05-25 14:31:42
Great point! Thanks for the concise explanation. I have yet to upgrade to UASF but feel that even a split isn't all that bad. I am sick and tired of filling the piggy bank of those who oppose it against any technical merit and would rather see Bitcoin (SegWit) compete with Bitcoin (classic) than being tied any longer to those 'agreement scribblers'.
In fact, I am even more extreme in that I don't think that a split is worse than only SegWit activation. The best outcome would be a split that is followed by an attack from the big block faction. It gives us the opportunity to cut out the cancerous miners altogether. Since coming across the Byteball protocol I have an inclining that this may provide a basis for a world without miners (and without PoS).
In short: A split is best, followed by an attack that legitimizes a new PoW with "ice age" like ETH in 12 months. This forces us to fork to proper worked out consensus protocol that makes it much harder for miners to conspire against the userbase!

@_date: 2017-05-12 23:36:44
Just use different mempools. That is much cleaner and doesn't need any sort of fork.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:44:30
The proposal is interesting and makes sense for the client implementations. However, if I am not mistaken it does only disable (core) nodes themselves. The Ethereum guys literally build a time-bomb into the consensus level, no matter what client you run the network simply slows down due to increased mining difficulty. - The problem that I see is that we don't have a sufficient emergency plan and would just roll into some PoW, possibly even dagger now that Ethereum goes PoS.
This time-bomb would ensure that miners can't take us hostage again and that a solution is deployed after a certain time.
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:57:47


No, the elegant way is to use ntimelock. Non-segwit miners can do as they wish but not spend the output as it is locked. Obviously, it would be better if they went all the way but this can come with time.

A miner can only include transactions he knows off. If a miner was to fish transactions out of another miners' mempool the miner could choose to encrypt his mempool. You would still have the general mempool for people who don't care. Proprietary mempools would not have to reside on the nodes at all.
Another option could be to encrypt the signature with the key from the preferred miner to make it impossible for anyone else to mine the transaction.
Obviously, a transaction could also be broadcasted to more than one mempool (with different fees).

"Input larger than maximum trading amount of 1.00 BTC is not allowed." (yet)
You want to use multiple bank accounts to avoid being traced by your counterparty. The guy will have your name and bank account details, it is prudent to protect your identy.
What if you had 5 gold coins and sold them in the same pawn shop? Isn't it concivible that the guy behind the counter calls his cousin to mug you because he knows you have money and possibly more coins (especially in Ireland) ...  Why not go to several shops and reduce the risk?
Of course, your bank could flag you as well for suspicious activity but this is non of your conern as you do nothing illigitimate (and it's below EUR 12.500).
As for taxation, I presume that you net the gains/losses and report them accordingly. Just make sure you have the receipt, for example from the exchange where you bought them fully registered, or from the random couchsurfer who sold them to you for cash.
PS: Using bitsquare allows you sell it slightly above market price (and keep the spread that the exchange would take) and realize a higher gain, on top you add liquidity to one of the places where people can trade freely.

What are their options? The only way out for the legacy chain is a hard fork in order to prevent a possible reorg in the future. Even if it was unlikely at the moment, it could happen 3 month down the line.
Coming to think of it, the miner conspiracy could actually start signaling SegWit after the 1st of August and force a reorg on the SegWit chain. Those they would activate SegWit on the legacy chain and possibly ruin the UASF people. That means we would have won in that Bitcoin would have SegWit activated, yet we would have lost our Bitcoin. True martyrs. :)
I guess the issue with this scenario is that the miner conspiracy that would engage in this reckless behavior would dramatically loose trust and you can probably write Bitcoin off as the competition is tight.
BUT, what if their goal is actually not to stall Bitcoin or get big blocks but to sabotage and finally destroy it, than this move would do the trick. To me it seems that even the ASIC Boost scam may not be the entire reason for their behavior.

Granted, there is truth to that. It's equal to making remarks in Esperanto. Yet, I won't accredit ill nature to the author trying to slip it in like that. I think Bitcoin is good place to make people question their presuppositions.
@_date: 2017-06-25 22:02:32
I have been looking into this since a while and found that the basic idea is actually quite solid. Blockchain is a sort of batch processing and DAG is continues ... both create a (Nakamoto) Consensus Space with different trade-offs.
Usually one would argue that Bitcoin is decentralized and DAG based designs are more at risk to centralize ... but the reality is that 5 guys can call the shots in Bitcoin land and under those circumstances Bitcoin is more pseudo-decentralized.
Another interesting aspect is that the total space of DAG designs is available at any given point but limited ... You could write 10GB in a matter of moments ... But you also loose the history as only a hash of the previous element survives. Blockchains contain usually the full history and need to be throttled but can append infinite amounts of data.
I'd say it's the next best shot for Bitcoin once we are forced to hardfork.
PS Iotas design is somewhat flawed as well as certain transaction spammers will eventually centralize the network as well, Byteball makes other trade-offs but seems more legit.
