You obviously believe in the power and future of Bitcoin, and maybe you are 100% right about this. But I always like to also think about the threats and if there are factors that could potentially cause it to fail or take a hit. Do you see any of such threats?

Neither do tons of the new investors that are currently in Bitcoin for the sole purpose of profiting from the big rise. What differs me from them is that I am not one of those new investors but just someone that's interested in what's currently happening. So my original question was, do you guys see this influx of investors without 'knowledge' about bitcoin as a threat or as an asset.
As far as the account goes I usually lurk reddit but did make an account a long time ago. In order to ask this question I simply logged in.

You call it ignorance, I call it objectivity.
I'm only asking a sincere question about your views on the long term future of Bitcoin and if you see any major roadblocks it still has to overcame that are currently not figured out yet. But if you take that the wrong way that's fine, have a nice day/

I probably don't, as I mentioned above I am an outsider. But my way of thinking was that the current economic system probably isnt overjoyed by Cryptocurrencies threatening their way of making money and I wonder what is in their power to potentially hurt the growth of Bitcoin.

So what is your long term goal in this. I'm genuinely interested. I obviously understand the concept of long term holding, but what's the endgoal? Cashing out at 10K? Assuming Bitcoin will become a standardized payment method on the long term?

Wouldn't that only be an option if Bitcoin at some point completely overtakes the current Fiat currencies as we know them tho? Obviously not impossible, certainly not from a technical perspective, but this entire world is currently based around fiat currencies, the bigger bitcoin becames the more of a threat it will be to those fiat currencies and the bigger political resistance against bitcoin will become, right? While Bitcoin could potentially come out on top it would have to face the power of world leading countries to do so, that's kind of a scary thought to me. Or am I completely wrong in this thinking?

If you believe that it is never adopted as a real currency obviously it would be best to sell at what you think is the peak. Future will tell if you were right or wrong
