He's saying you clearly know the answer to this question and are just trying to stir up shit.  Try not to be so obvious

It's wrong to think bitcoin will work like that. At least not yet. Can you go to the store and buy groceries with gold?
Bitcoin is a store of value and trading vehicle at the moment. No crypto is yet in a place to replace things like visa card transactions. We're a couple of years away from that.

6? I thought there were only three shady guys running Bitcoin. 
Ohhh. You mean Bitcoin. The real one. Yeah, I'd choose that over the shit version being pushed by scammers. Have fun on the ride down!

Don't forget to mention most of them are low transaction fee spam attack by the BCH side. Dirty tactics like this, along with their pump and dump shenanigans make it pretty clear which side I want to be on.

It's slow because some dickhead scam artists are spamming the mempool with low transaction fees. It won't work in the long run and just shows how desperate the BCH/s2x group is.
Satoshi would 100% not have approved of this bullshit, especially with that group claiming they are fulfilling his vision.

Right before CME brings all the big investors in? Not likely

He actually meant BTC, but is just projecting. BCH is run by three shady ass scammers and they are just trying (and failing) to steal the bitcoin name.

If Venezuela starts utilizing Bitcoin in a major way, I guarantee Uncle Sam will do everything he can to destroy the coin's value.
