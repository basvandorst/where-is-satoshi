Why don't people just create another Bitcoin Foundation, call it something like 'the Bitcoin Group,' do the same thing as BF, and therefore divert monopolistic power from BF and create another political front for Bitcoin.

Is it really? I don't see any numbers stating that. You need to do the math to prove to people that in every category Bitcoin still comes out on top.

It's because the U.S. invented and developed these systems. It's extremely expensive to redo infrastructure, which is why we are sill on older iterations of the credit card system versus other nations that adopted the system years after its invention and thus adopted a newer and more advanced system.

The government doesn't control inflation. It's a product of supply and demand. Over time, people are willing to spend more for the same product. If anything, it's the industries that control inflation.
@_date: 2015-01-29 22:44:55
That's only partially true. Money supply has less of an effect on inflation than the open market value of the currency.

Tell that to black people. If you're white, you basically are. It sounds like you are upset because you think they have an edge over others, while white people have the ultimate edge as the majority race.
If you work hard, you get rewarded. And success is really leveraging who you know in high places. As I said before, Jewish people leverage those connections. It's not illegal, there's nothing morally wrong about it. If you feel like it's unfair, then that's too bad. There are much more unfair things to happen in life, and if you really try hard enough, you will achieve just as much as any Jew will.

I've got just the thing for you:
There's this biomedical endocardiograph tech startup my friends are in and they have just made some crazy breakthrough. They IPO'ed last year because the wanted to offer their investors and internal shareholders something tangible, so their share price now is super low.
So if you buy in now, your stock is going to triple when they have their press release within the next week. However, I'd get in now, because once word gets out, that price will skyrocket and you'll have so few margins that it wouldn't even be worth it.
You can check them out on the OTCQB under CGNH.

There is no way that halving will increase the theft rate by 2x. People are currently thieving at 16% regardless of how many Bitcoins are out there. For example, just because the government prints less fiat currency does not mean the amount of stolen dollars over a course of time is at all affected. Robbers will rob regardless.

It has to do with the sense of community. I've had Jewish friends tell me they only got an interview or a job because the boss of a company is Jewish. They do each other solids and pull their own up through the ranks.
And unlike Asian Americans, Jewish people generally do know all of the Jewish people in their community- based on the fact that it is a religion and they put an emphasis on networking and knowing each other. If you ever as an Asian person if they know another Asian simply because they're Asian, they will laugh. Jewish people have a good chance of knowing them if they are in their local community.

IIRC there was a post by a doctor / psychiatric as to why you can't use ketamine to cure depression.
@_date: 2015-02-11 01:59:02
It should be noted that ketamine cannot be used for depression and only works in severe cases for a limited number of treatments, due to its rapid tolerance and abuse potential and psychedelic research is still very speculative.
I do agree that there needs to be more research in these areas and that the drug war is a shit system, but it's not as if every mental illness has an illicit drug treatment option.
