Yes I know but I don't mind using it as my wallet. I just wanted to add a node to the network.  
I googled it but I'm connected through a USB stick (the connection is nice), so it doesn't provide me many advanced options.  
Anyway I looked into the advanced settings, following the instructions I found here and there, but nothing...still only 8 active connections.  
I have also tried to disable momentarily the firewalls to check if they were blocking the flow but without results.
@_date: 2019-11-01 17:05:54
Isn't it limited in this case?
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:19:17
I will give it a try
@_date: 2019-11-02 15:11:08
Yeah sure, I'm going to try the Tor setup first..then if it's not working I'll start considering to upgrade my internet service
@_date: 2019-11-02 07:29:35
I'm playing around with that.  
The only way through which I could get more nodes connected is by manually writing "addnode=\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_" in bitcoin.conf.
Now I can get more nodes connected, but only one way..still 0 inbound connections even typing "server=1".
I'm still applying changes and I'll continue doing so until I get it done.
@_date: 2019-11-02 05:39:04
Since my bitcoin.conf file is empty, do I have to just open it, type the parameter in then close and save it?
@_date: 2019-11-01 16:54:58
This is the message: 
**Error:** I could **not** see your service on **1.47.169.9** on port (**8333**)   
 Reason: Connection timed out

I'm connected through a USB stick, I don't have an actual router.  
So the interface doesn't provide many advanced options, I should find some path through the control panel.
@_date: 2019-11-01 17:03:24
For both addresses I get:
 
# This site can’t be reached
**192.168.0.1** took too long to respond.
* Checking the connection
* Checking the proxy and the firewall
* Running Windows Network Diagnostics
ERR\_CONNECTION\_TIMED\_OUT 
Is there a way to bypass the router?
@_date: 2019-11-01 16:48:49
What do you mean?
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:10:39
Yeah I get the point..I'm just concerned about the vulnerabilities
@_date: 2019-11-01 17:16:23
Thanks for the effort
@_date: 2019-11-02 09:58:29
Thanks, I will try it out!
@_date: 2019-11-01 09:02:17
That's awesome!
@_date: 2019-11-02 08:10:30
Yep, this is my fear..that whatever I do I would never get inbound connections without fixing that detail.
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:18:35
I downloaded directly on my external hard disk.
I read about people experiencing long days downloads but luckily it took less than 18 hours in my case.
@_date: 2019-11-01 17:09:44
I understand..so this means that without access to my router I can't do otherwise, am I right?
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:53:27
After all these helpful comments and some research I'm starting to change my mind.
Even just out of curiosity I will try to do some operations with it.
I really enjoy learning by doing and I'm totally fascinated by Bitcoin.
Normally I use my Nano S to keep my coins safe.
But I could use Bitcoin Core as an intermediary wallet in case I need quick, small in size and hassle free transactions.
You know, the point is that I'm not gonna spend my coins on anything. So they would just sit there,that's why I prefer other solutions
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:12:52
So this Tor option is becoming something to consider
@_date: 2019-11-01 17:44:45
I tried to open it with the text editor but once it opens it looks empty
@_date: 2019-11-02 06:21:09
Just pasted it in my file, awesome!
I'll put my hands on it later once I finish working.
Thanks a lot��������
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:13:43
It works like a smartphone..there is a SIM card in it
@_date: 2019-11-02 13:03:44
The guys in this thread are much more tech savvy than me, I'm sure they will come up with a solution for you.
@_date: 2019-11-01 17:04:43
Of course I'm paying for an isp, but that's why I'm asking you guys..I don't know how to do it.
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:06:07
Do you have easy instructions for this?
I'm interested
@_date: 2019-11-01 17:17:27
I don't think it's working as you said, but I really appreciate your help.
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:29:37
It is constantly online
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:20:05
I will do it
@_date: 2019-11-01 18:09:47
I will for sure!
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:29:59
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-11-01 17:25:53
how to open a .conf file?
@_date: 2019-11-02 09:35:20
...1 cent...
Thanks for sharing. Nice to listen to your story.
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:09:01
So was your router already set to allow inbound connections?
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:07:42
I'll definitely check it out����
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:16:48
I've also found a way to enabling inbound connections by disabling the firewalls..but this would let ANY connections in amd to be honest I don't want to be so exposed.
P.S. even if it says "inbound connections allowed" I still wasn't receiving any on Bitcoin Core
@_date: 2019-11-01 16:47:21
I don't know what is the problem.  
The software it's running just fine. The only thing is that it's limited to the 8 outbound active connections but I would like to contribute at full potential.
@_date: 2019-11-01 16:51:07
So do I have to ask my service provider to open it?
@_date: 2019-11-02 12:48:00
Wow, I don't know to say the truth.
I've read many posts talking about long time downloads as yours, in fact I was surprised when I saw that mine was done in such a short period of time.
Maybe it's about the connection quality or the hardware specs.
@_date: 2019-11-01 17:35:23
I can imagine that it feels rewarding!  
I'm using a USB dongle as modem, I'm running bitcoin core on an external hard disk.
Are you suggesting me to run it directly on my PC?  
How could that bypass the closed port?  
I checked on bitnodes as well my status, and it says that my Port 8333 is closed
@_date: 2019-11-02 01:48:05
I'm sure he just typed it wrong by mistake, let's be friendly in here.
@_date: 2019-11-02 16:55:57
I followed all the tips and suggestions you gave me and I'm pleased and amazed from how many things I've learned through you all in less than 24 hours.
I'm still unable to receive inbound connections, which I assume I won't be able to get unless I have access to my port 8333, but I've been able to increase the outbound connections and get practical with the whole concept. I take it as a momentarily success.
I consider it enough for now, and commit myself to go forward.
Thank you all for sharing your knowledge!
@_date: 2019-10-31 15:50:13
I just did the same thing today! ;)
