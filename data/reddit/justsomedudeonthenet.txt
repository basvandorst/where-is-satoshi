Excellent point...seems like you've given this some thought.  A little *too* much though!
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:52:26
I wouldn't.
Most miners are running their cards undervolted for better hashes per watt instead of overclocked for maximum speed.
At worst, I'd expect to have to reflash stock firmware and maybe grease or replace the fans.  Nothing too expensive.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:06:46
Right, but that's a good thing in this case.
If I got a new ledger and the seed words were already revealed I would assume they are comprised and want to generate a brand new wallet.

In other news, Visa sees MasterCard as silly and will not be processing their transactions.
Why would they publicly support something that is trying to position itself as their direct competitor?
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:00:34
It is, but overclocking increased power consumption, and the sweet spot for best earnings is usually to underclock them, unless you have free electricity.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:54:14
You can generate a new seed for it, can't you?  Or is it hard coded in the device?

I don't see how that doesn't strengthen my argument.  We replaced gold with gold-backed paper money, then eventually with just paper money, in part *because* of the problems with hauling a million dollars of gold around.
Cash was a step forward from gold because it was easier to store and trade.  Bitcoin is yet another step forward, being even easier to store and trade in today's online world.
Gold has at least some intrinsic value as a useful material.  Bitcoin does not have that particular advantage.  It has value because everyone agrees it has value.  One of the things that will help ensure it retains that value is people being able to spend it.
I can go to the store and trade cash for food.  I can probably find a store that will take a gold bar as payment for food, but it will be harder.  Bitcoin is even harder to spend directly, but I hope that changes.  I don't want Bitcoin to replace gold.  I want it to replace *banks*.

Assuming your spouse knew nothing about bitcoin besides "they have a bunch of magic internet money", what information/instructions would you leave so they'd be able to access and use them if you died?
@_date: 2018-08-20 12:26:58
You mean like nicehash, awesome miner, multipoolminer, and a dozen services like that which already exist?
@_date: 2018-05-12 03:08:38
bc1 addresses are native segwit addresses.
The 3... addresses are segwit wrapped in a P2SH (pay to script hash) address.  They are backwards compatible with clients that don't support segwit. They were intended to be transitional while everyone moves to using segwit.  Services that haven't been updated to process segwit addresses properly could have trouble with the bc1 addresses.  Many (most?) services have updated already.

That is a phenomenal explaination. Well done.

Current system is plenty abusable too.  Sell something online, ship it, buyer claims they never got it.  Or that it wasn't what they ordered.  eBay for example almost always sides with buyers.  Buyer keeps item, gets money back, laughs.  Seller gets all the funds in their PayPal account frozen, even ones that weren't part of this transaction.
Just like a cash transaction, where I pay for a new mattress in cash and trust the store to deliver it. If you don't trust the other party, that's what escrow services are for - they can hold onto the money and they ultimately decide who gets it.
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:36:58
It can do that right now.  No need to wait for LN.

On it's own, no.  But 8MB every 10 minutes for the rest of eternity does add up.
Of course, so does 1MB every 10 minutes for the rest of eternity.  The block chain is already around 128GB.

Because one of the key principals of bitcoin is that I am in control of my money.  Nobody can reach into my bitcoin wallet and take coins back without my approval.  Once the money is mine, it's mine.
Banks on the other hand can just reach into your bank account and take your money for all kinds of reasons.  They can lock up your money if they think you've made a fraudulent transaction.  They can refund money because the other person claims you didn't send them a product (even if you did).
The only refunds that should happen are when the receiving party agrees to send the money back.  We don't need a refund system for that.
What's the point in having bitcoins that are worth more if Visa can just decide you didn't earn those bitcoins and take them back? 
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:50:38
This is why I don't get people who just say to HODL all your bitcoins, never spending a single bit of it.
Money, any type of money, is only good if you can exchange it for goods and services.  If nobody is spending bitcoin, the only think you can do with it will be to trade it on exchanges.
I specifically hunt out stores that accept bitcoin for payment, because I want to encourage more stores to do it.  Until bitcoin is widely accepted for purchasing things, it can't replace our current financial system.
So yeah, HODL some of your bitcoin.  But spend some too!  And make sure you tell companies you do business with that you want to be able to pay them in bitcoin, or take your business to places that already accept it.
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:33:01
Technically yes, I agreed to it.  But it's not like you have a practical alternative choice. All banks have those rules.
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:03:27
It is a big deal.  Ramping the difficulty down makes it hard for someone to have enough hash power to create a longer valid chain all on their own and reverse all the previous transactions.
If the difficulty started very low, someone with enough miners could sell all their BCH and then undo the transaction and sell them again.
It's still a risk with them not having very much hash power, and the difficulty dropping.  But dropping the difficulty down to 1% at the start would have caused chaos.
@_date: 2018-06-18 15:37:10
Wouldn't there be a huge time delay between the price dropping and hash rates going down though?
If you're setting up a log of ASICs to mine, you're preordering them months in advance.  So you bought them when the price was high.
Now the price drops, and your new batch of ASICs arrive.  As long as you are getting electricity cheap enough that you're above breaking even on electric costs, you may as well set them up, even if you aren't getting the returns you expected.  Even if the profit is so low now that you aren't going to break even on the cost of the ASIC, you'd still mine with them to cut down some of the losses.
It's only once the machines are costing more electricity to run than they generate in profits that I'd expect to see anyone turn off their machines.

I'd be more apt to say that cryptocurrencies are all one basket, and Bitcoin is one of the eggs in it.  Only investing in a bunch of different altcoins should still be considered putting all your eggs in one basket, since their prices tend to rise and crash somewhat in unison.
Just wanted to point that out since some people think they are safely investing by spreading it out among a whole bunch of different altcoins.  By all means go ahead and do that - but not more than you can afford to lose if they all tank.

Lies!  All of South America is in black and white, except for the money which is colorful.  How would they even get pamphlets with color on them?  They'd have to soak the colored ink out of the money and rub it on the pamphlets.  In which case it basically is money!

Unless you can profit from those billions changing hands, then profit again when you deny you said it.
Then not signing it so you can say it was fake will come in handy.

This is Bitcoin...you don't even need a payment processor.  There are plugins for some ecommerce systems that handle generating payment addresses, figuring out exchange rates, and tracking payments.  Or you can make your own fairly easily.
If you want to convert it to fiat, you'll have to put it on an exchange and sell it.  That's pretty much the only advantage of processors like bitpay.
Then nobody can cut you off.  You control the payment processing yourself.

What cart software are you using?

Same here, except I have all electric heat.  May as well pump that electricity through a video card instead of a resistance wire. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 03:21:47
For the same reason people are willing to put up with paying those fees now - customers want the buyer protection and rewards that credit cards offer.  They can act as a kind of escrow service - guaranteeing a customer gets their money back if the store doesn't deliver the goods.
I really hope better systems for that are built that don't require their services though.
@_date: 2017-09-17 02:47:08
What makes Bitcoin awesome is we doing need a Bitcoin PayPal.  Anyone can send and receive Bitcoin directly, no need for a third party at all.
Where a third party *is* useful is as an escrow service, to mediate payment disputes.  And for that, we don't want anything similar to what PayPal offers.
Most day to day transactions don't need that kind of protection, so using Bitcoin directly works nicely.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:07:19
Yes, but they need the engine running, since that's where the heat comes from.  With a Tesla, you can run the heater anytime.  Preferably while it's charging.
So you plug in, and leave the heat on all night.

If he's storing all his Bitcoin on an exchange he deserves to get it stolen.  They should be after his 12/24 word seed recovery.

Good bot
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:44:08
If you download, run, and import your private keys to it, then it would be possible.
I highly doubt they would try to steal your BTC to begin with.  But some people are dealing with a lot of money here, so it's wise to be paranoid and assume everyone is trying to steal from you.
@_date: 2017-07-09 20:20:33
As I understand it, after a split your node/wallet will only support one of the now two coins.
So you would need to export it and import into a node that supports the other coin.

You are correct.  There is plenty of error correction written to a CD, but it won't fill the entire disk with it.
You can actually tell roughly how full a burnt CD is by looking at the bottom.  There is a very noticeable transition ring between written and unwritten areas.
If you wanted to fill the disk with a single wallet backup, you'd have to specifically burn the file multiple times to the disk.
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:44:59
This is correct.
On the BCC fork, all your bitcoins will still be in wallet1, because the transaction that moved them to wallet2 doesn't exist on their fork.
This is the correct, slightly paranoid, way of doing it.  By doing it this way, you are protecting yourself from having to trust BCC wallet software that could leak your private keys.  If it did, you'd lose your BCC, but not your BTC.
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:08:11
BCC changed to have real replay protection.  So transactions made by a BTC client will be invalid on the BCC chain.
Originally it was going to be opt in replay protection where you did need to do the BCC transaction (and make sure it was a transaction that wouldn't be valid on the BTC chain).
Because you now *can* do the BTC transaction first, it's recommended to because it's safer that way - your wallet's keys aren't exposed to the BCC client until after you have drained the coins from it.  So even if they wanted to, the BCC client couldn't steal your BTC. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:02:36
If you aren't concerned about getting BCC coins, all you have to do is exactly nothing.
This prodecure is only necessary if you want to use your BCC coins generated by the split, and don't trust the BCC wallet creators not to steal your BTC coins.

But btc is heavily biased as well.
I have yet to find a sub that isn't extremely polarised towards one side or another.
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:05:18
I am having a hard time understanding it as well.  All the articles I have read seem to be extremely biased towards one side or the other.  I would love to see an explanation of exactly what is going on that explains both sides of the argument that seems to be happening.
@_date: 2017-06-29 13:10:17
I see it as a bit of both.  I hold some of my coins, and I spend some.
What good is a currency if nobody ever spends it?  Or accepts it as payment?  The more people actually use bitcoin for purchasing stuff, the more stores will start accepting it.  The more stores that accept it, the more useful it is, and the more valuable it is.
@_date: 2017-06-29 15:11:10
Not once *we* have Bitcoin.  Once *everyone* has Bitcoin.
Once I can buy my groceries with Bitcoin, pay all of my bills (including taxes) in Bitcoin, get a mortgage and buy a house in Bitcoin, and get paid for my job in Bitcoin, then ya, we don't need banks.  But that is still a long ways off.

@_date: 2017-06-29 14:38:14
That's not the only thing stopping it.  In both Canada and the US, and probably several other countries, banks have been very resistant to bitcoin - closing people's accounts and banning them from banks, making it harder to convert between bitcoin and fiat.
And since you can't pay for everything in bitcoin (yet), people still need to be able to convert between the two.
Eventually that will be resolved by either the banks calming the hell down, or more and more places accepting bitcoin.  But either way, there's a lot more work to do even after the whole blocksize debate is solved.
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:41:23
But most things you buy, whether with bitcoin or fiat money, depreciate very quickly.  That futon you bought for $1000 may sell for $100 used.  That doesn't stop you from buying a futon if you need one.
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:08:16
Most likely what you are talking about is it sending Bitcoin to your other service, and the other address you see there is your change address.
You can't just send a portion of your Bitcoin.  You always send all of the Bitcoin a particular address has, and specify that some goes to the destination, and the rest goes to one of your other addresses (minus fees).
@_date: 2018-12-25 22:36:35

All the threads, across all the subreddit I have seen basically say "our solution is the one true solution and everyone else is an idiot".  But what I really want to read is who these factions are, how their ideas differ, and what their plans are.
No arguing over who is right or wrong, I just want the facts on what each side is pushing for and why.
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:28:08
I suppose that's true.  But with buying with cash you also missed out on the opportunity to buy something that would become more valuable.  Like stocks, or baseball cards, or bitcoins.
