If someone took your wallet, loaded it up and transferred the coins to themselves a backup would be of no help right?

From my observations on the BTC forums I believe It's pretty much a total bubble. Some of the biggest players are just holding out until the time is right to cash out.

Passwords are hashed ( as for hashing, we use standard unix md5+salt, will switch to $2a$ or $5$ eventually

Skepticism is good. I'm more upset at people who blindly shout "TROLL" whenever anyone shows some skepticism or points out some downfalls


Depends what they do with the bitcoins once they have them




Wallets being semi easily stolen could be considered a serious problem especially if you were a business owner . Bitcoin being used more as an investment than a currency is also a problem imo.


Gambling yes if you are investing in hopes of a profit. If it's a Ponzi scheme then FOREX is also one.

Silk road is the largest most talked about, most public merchant in the bitconomy. Your currency of choice is not sullied by the illegal market, bitcoin is.
Also fuck silk road for being so blatant. There is a reason these kind of sites are USUALLY kept secretive.
