I used a Electrum before getting a hardware wallet.

The futures are cash settled, so they don't need to buy any BTC.
Some people are saying that this rise is for a futures short later, but I've also heard that most of this recent investment is coming from Japan.

It's based on the size of the transaction not the amount of BTC. Consolidating many transactions might cost more, but moving one large amount shouldn't cost much at all.

Coinbase usually lists a price a bit higher than market. You should look into using GDAX which is Coinbase's exchange, and purchase using limit orders.

Any number bigger than the current number is a good number and fine with me.

It's a way for financial institutions to bet on the price of BTC without actually buying any. They make a deal to buy or sell at a time in the future for whatever price, and can settle the difference between that and the actual price at the time in cash.
It's often used as a way to hedge against an investment losing value.

No, you'd probably need to roll it over to another provider.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:06:38
No, but you can make a watch only wallet in Electrum with your addresses.
You can also look on blockchain.info online by searching your public key.

It could be. Opinion is really divided on it right now. Some people think it will bring a huge influx of value, others that it will drive the price of BTC down through manipulation.
I'm still trying to figure out what I think.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:44:09
In my experience it's much better to buy Bitcoin outright and hodl it. You will make more than what your mining contract would get for you.

There's been talk of stopping the futures market in the US, but I believe it will go forward Sunday.
Japan is also going to be creating a futures market.
When Korea sees that the sky hasn't fallen, they'll come around or be left behind.

It's instability leading up to a potential economic downturn that might convince people to pull money from other areas and store the value in Bitcoin . . . in order to sell if there is an actual downturn.

I hope you make a lot of gains so you can buy your house with cash. I don't think you'll be approved if you drive your credit score into the ground.

There is another option. Look into something called a self-directed IRA. It took a while, but I just bought BTC with my IRA two days ago.

I never claimed it started the philosophy, but the thread, and the typo, certainly became a rallying point for it in crypto culture.
Feel free to call it idiotic, but I think it's cool.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:51:11
Didn't I read that Japan also greenlit a futures market?
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:28:42
Yes, there could be massive changes ahead, and if things collapse enough, currency won't matter as much as food.
Before that point I will hopefully have traded all my crypto and will be hodling goats.
For right now, I am glad to get away from the fractional reserve banking and expansive monetary policy.

I was considering the same, looking at early withdrawal and penalties, but then someone here mentioned a self-directed IRA, so we took that route.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:52:16
No, they should be crediting you BCH in the amount you had in the wallet at the time of the fork.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:12:55
I've also heard that a lot of this recent investment is from the Japanese markets.
Also something about BTC selling much higher in Korean exchanges.

Use GDAX, Coinbase's exchange, and send using a wire transfer. My bank charged me $25 and GDAX $10, but it deposited the same day it was sent.

I used a wire transfer. My bank charged me $25 and GDAX $10, but worth it to get in and invested on the same day.

But your bank has to not decline the transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:44:33
From what I've read, the date is part of the contract, and they don't have to purchase coins, just settle the difference in cash.
People have been discussing this, so I recommend doing a search.

Yes, the size of the transaction is how much memory the transaction is in bytes.
That's why the transaction fee is in satoshi per byte.
If I have a wallet with one transaction in it for 200 BTC, the fee to send all of that to another wallet should be less than if I had a wallet with 20 different transactions of .001 BTC each and tried to send my combined .020 BTC to a new wallet.
Ether should work the same way. It's not about the crypto amount, but how much memory the transaction takes up.
Think of it this way:
You have 20 gold bars you want to transport to New York by truck, and you have to take a road that makes you pay a toll.
If all the gold bars are in one truck, you pay the toll once.
If each gold bar is in it's own truck, you have to pay the toll for each truck. 
Same amount is transported, but different fees for using the road.

It's a bit more than that. Have you read the thread? It's a whole investment philosophy.
Basically, don't try and time the market if you don't know what you're doing. Know you don't know what you're doing and hodl, and you can come out ahead.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:34:44
Well . . . aren't futures markets opening in a week or so? Pretty sure they didn't do that for Beanie Babies.
