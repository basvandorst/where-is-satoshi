Does anyone have the screenshot of Bitcoin at $75,000 USD? Someone posted "a picture from the future" a few months ago of coinmarketcap with bitcoin circulating supply between 17,000,000 and 18,000,000, at the time bitcoin was around 16,900,000 circulating supply.

I'm looking into building a raspberry pi full node to have a wallet. I am reluctant to get any sort of wallet because I do not want to get scammed. I saw a post the other month where some cold wallet arrived "pre-configured" and if the user used them, the coins would have gone to someone else. I am not sure about ledgers and their ability to keep my coins safe. I want to run a full bitcoin node, but I am worried about fulling a full bitcoin cash node instead. What is the best way to keeps my coins safe and in my hands without getting scammed?

If you bought Bitcoin at the all time high of ~$19,800 in December 2017 in Venezuela, you still have money today in May 2019. I think someone posted a graph a few months ago that illustrated it.

Wasn't there a malware feature that altered the copy/paste function while entering in bitcoin addresses? Like, I would copy your public bitcoin address, and when I paste it into my transaction screen, I would instead be pasting a different address unbeknownst to me?
