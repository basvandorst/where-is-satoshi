Yalls worked, but not Starblocks (Send Payment Failed). It then asked for my peer network but I am in over my head already. What would I do then in order to purchase an Espresso Coin Panna?  (that one that worked was indeed lightning fast BTW.  It's ALL over when Amazon gets their hands into this ;) har )

Okay and so then I tried to pay to publish an article on yalls.  It took the money out of my account instantly, but on yalls, it reads 'Payment error :('  hmmm, still working out those bugs :)...

With my balance of about $4.50 tusd, I ordered an Espresso Coin Panna, copied the address, pasted it into the Lightning, it showed the correct item and amount on the lightning test page, I hit send and....a red rectangle popped up: "Send Payment Failed" :(  It asks for the peer address, but now i am already in over my head.  What next?  And why might it have failed? thanks!

...except from a greedy miner's perspective.  So i guess we are finding ourselves in an interesting dilemma, where collective benefit is not in the best interests of the transaction processors.  Hey, wait... isn't this a lot like what we have already with our existing banking system?

It's true. I noticed that too. I was under the impression that the people behind Bcash owned [bitcoin.com]( N'est-ce pas? Roger Ver?  And yes, I agree with some other commenters that all media is biased.  Nevertheless, it is good to be conscious of the different biases of various news sources.

Allegedly.  All of it; every last satoshi.

Agreed, but Indian people discriminate against other Indians with darker skin too, which I find to be incredibly odd, being as how skin color says nothing about quality of upbringing, wealth, education or anything else really.

Okay, so what I don't get, is that I have ALWAYS seen Tether as a placeholder for USD.  My understanding is that it isn't convertible directly to USD.   For me, it has been incredibly useful to convert crypto to Tether in times of volatility and then hop back in the game asap.  I don't need and have never needed them to maintain a 1 to 1 ratio of Tether to USD.  What I don't understand is why they claim that they have such a tremendous reserve; maybe some sort of govt regulation or to tell people what they seemingly need to hear. The irony of course, is that USD isn't backed by ANYTHING, not gold, not silver, nothing.   So I find it incredibly ironic that people are up in arms over the fact that Tether isn't backed 1 to 1 by a  worthless currency, which happens to only be backed by 'faith' and 'trust' (and lots and lots of guns).  I don't see them as 'printing' Tether. My understanding is that it was always to be used as a tool on crypto exchanges, not as a currency.  Come ON people, think for yourselves! Don't let mass media manipulate your perceptions.  If I cash out on Coinbase, I pay 1.5&amp; fees. BUT what if I just want to step away for a minute, not cash out? then it's only 0.25&amp; fees to hop to Tether.  It was a smart invention.  Anyone who says otherwise doesn't get the original intent.  PS\-\-Any artificial price manipulation would have been through the use of Credit Cards to buy crypto, not tethers.  Because Tethers don't create money; credit cards do. Out of thin air.  Welcome to the fractional reserve banking system known as the Fed.  It's a shell game; they're looking for a scapegoat. They want to direct blame away from the existing corrupt System and undermine what they perceive as threats.  See here. Tether is a lynchpin. Destroy tether and topple the crypto market: [

Thank you for both mining bitcoin AND processing transactions!  I suspect a lot of the holdup with unconfirmed transactions has partly to do with the fact that a lot of miners have switched over to Cash, leaving Bitcoin users in the lurch.  Please someone, correct me if this hypothesis is errant, as I am only observant, not coder.

Have you considered dynamic blocksizing , as used in Monera? Willy Woo suggested it, but i have yet to hear anyone truly knowledgeable discussing why it could or could not work with Bitcoin. Thanks!
