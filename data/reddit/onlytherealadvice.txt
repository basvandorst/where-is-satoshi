Crap, you had 5 years of bad taxes that you had to amend and pay on? You did it all without an audit and volunteered to correct everything?

In most jurisdictions it seems taxing is any trade. So, going from bitcoin to ethereum back to bitcoin is taxable. And, when bitcoin cash was created in some jurisdictions that is considered income whether you hold the bitcoin cash or not.
So, for example, 100% of people in the USA would need to pay taxes due to the bitcoin tax spinoff whether or not they held the bitcoin cash or not. So, let's assume there are 5 million bitcoin holders in the US. That is 5 million people that would be filing crypto taxes (or avoiding it) and 5 million people to audit.
There should be atleast a couple that actually got audited.

Maybe in the US, but there may be non-US experiences.

All experiences. I am curious how different countries handle it and how much of a hard ass they are when they audit. For example, asking for blockchain transaction IDs, etc.

From my understanding for the US, you must pay taxes if you change coins (trade). It is classified as personal property in the US. And, there is no 1031 exchange.
So, if you are not paying taxes, but you sold coins for another coins and you get audited it would be pretty sucky. Let's say you bought $10k worth of cions on coinbase and that translated to 10 bitcoin as you bought in early 2017.
Well, the auditor will say "Show me the wallet that held 10 bitcoin for the last year". You obviously cannot do that because let's say you sold it for ethereum. The problem is when you sold for ethereum that is a taxable event and you didn't file that, so that is tax fraud.
This part of the IRS rules is very clear. The only part that is not clear is whether hard forks are to be treated as income on date of receipt or as property with a 0 cost basis so you don't have to pay tax until you sell and its treated as a capital gain.

Obviously when they say show me the wallet you need to prove ownership via signing. I don't think you understand how a tax case works in the US. There is not presumption of innocence. It is responsibility of tax payer to provide evidence. Lack of evidence is guilt because the law requires that evidence to be maintained.

A phone number is a form of KYC if they verify it. Identity is attached to phone number.
