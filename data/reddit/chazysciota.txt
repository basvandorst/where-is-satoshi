I was legitimately hoping you'd come back with something besides a mises link.  But since you did, what exactly do you find persuasive about their argument on deflation?  The claim is so extraordinary and contrary... what made you make up your mind in favor of it?   
@_date: 2018-09-11 20:54:14
Deflation's effect on an economy is pretty well understood, because it happens.  Why do you think an intentionally deflationary currency would work better in practice?  
@_date: 2018-09-11 12:39:13


That's an massive overstatement, IMO.  There is room for rational debate at the margins, but there are pretty solid reasons why direct comparisons are problematic, such as Austrian School's rejection of mathematical models, and other vestigial oddities it brings along from its 19th century roots.  From the perspective of mainstream economics, Austrian school looks more like homeopathy than medicine.... more alchemy than chemistry.

First, sorry... I shouldn't have phrased my comment so negatively.  Everyone is different, and addiction is complicated.
Yes, I was a smoker when I read it.  I also have read his alcohol one as well.  I really do wish beating addiction was as simple as reading about how dumb addiction is and then proclaiming yourself a non-addict.  Maybe it is for some people, but it wasn't for me because I never really bought his premise that I wasn't deriving any enjoyment from my addictions.  YMMV.  Thinking back, I never really had any withdraw symptoms that I was "treating," so his whole theory of addiction as a joyless trap was never enlightening to me.
["The Secret"]( is a self-help book that came out about a decade ago, which was pumped relentlessly by Oprah... it boils down to the power of positive thinking.  
And congrats on quitting!  Whatever works for you, keep doing it.  If reading and re-reading 50 Shades of Grey is working, then rock on.

I certainly didn't start at $5.  started at $1 and when I got annoyed with the wait/uncertainty (sometimes you'd just never see them again), I ramped up the tips, hoping that was the problem.   But whatever, I'm not the most outgoing or gregarious person in public, so I'm sure I just wasn't making the most memorable impression.  I dunno.  Plus I'm more of a drinker than gambler, so I don't really like sitting around wondering if/when my drink is going to show up before I wander to the next table... so no prob going to the bar.
I'll still order the free drinks if I'm asked, but I think the whole premise was oversold to my by friends and TV/movies.  If you're sticking to one table for an hour or two, then I totally understand why that works well.

That's fair.  My only caveat for your reasoning is that just because someone isn't racing to engage with you on it, doesn't mean they don't have an informed opinion.  This isn't an explicitly political sub, and nobody owes you an explanation, so just throwing around words like "ignorant" from go is just poisoning the well and reduces any conversation down to a pissing match.


I disagree.  I don't think it says anything about them being "ignorant" or "manipulated."  I think its a direct response to your tone.  






You're assuming the worst about a stranger and then demanding that they refute the charge.  At the very least that's a bad faith effort, and at worst it's just straight trolling.  And if you're just looking to inflame and insult, then you're doing it right.  But if you're actually trying to have a conversation then remember the human and give people the benefit of the doubt, even if you can't come to any agreement with them.

I don't disagree with that statement.  I think gold probably has some tiny amount of intrinsic value due solely to its unique physical properties, but to an investor?  Nah, not really.
@_date: 2018-07-06 23:52:55
I have so many questions.

The best part of this is if you apply the usual logic to the FB story, everyone should be saying "Whatevs, I don't care about 'crash' to 175!  I bought at 20 so I'm still up 870%!  LOL weak hands!"
@_date: 2018-07-04 19:05:31
No argument here. Just saying that there had never been a fork like that before, with such a high profile.   Obviously things have changed. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:03:33
You're sound like you're confusing market value with intrinsic value a little in your examples.  Your weekly sub sandwich purchase is not a demonstration of btc's intrinsic value, because it depends entirely on the current market value.  Fiat, btc, any currency not backed by a tangible commodity has no intrinsic value.
I can list a bunch of reasons why I like to buy lunch with paypal, but that doesn't mean my paypal address has any intrinsic value.
@_date: 2018-07-06 20:51:10
OP, you seem like a nice kid, and maybe this isn't your fault, but..... what the fuck is going on here?
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:36:24
The connection is that my bet was that the tattoo shop does not accept btc for payment, but does accept tips in btc.  Which is fine as well, but far different from truly accepting it.
But whatever, do you want your 0.00018 btc or not?  
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:02:27
That sounds exhausting, but good on you for putting in the effort.
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:29:30
Right on.  I appreciate the double edit too :)  I am very possibly a textbook moron, and likely a pedantic boor; but I wasn't trying to be an asshole.  Sorry if I came off that way.

That was the insinuation I took from this.  If you believed assertion that it has no intrinsic value, then I'm not sure what the point was, but ok.

Weren't their customer basically demanding it?  They wanted their BCH that came from the BTC in their coinbase accounts from the fork.

My guess would be that what you took a pic of is akin to a tip jar for the tattoo artist.  You would still need to pay the shop in Krone (fiat).
And it's not a donation, you technically won the bet, since it's in Denmark and they don't accept Euros :P.  I'm serious, PM me a wallet address and I'll send it to you.

Sorry. I didn’t mean anything specific. There are a ton of reasons why 19k could be the peak.  Anyone who dismisses the possibility as “idiotic” has made far too many assumptions about a whole host of issues.   That’s the danger of echo chambers line this sub, when there is real money on the line.

Yeah that's pretty much my point.  ETC is/was nowhere near as high profile BCH.  Hell, ETH wasn't even on Coinbase at the time.  BCH was the first fork that Coinbase retail had to deal with, and their customers were hammering them about it.

The problem is that advertising on FB is **effective**, and their customers find value in it.  The large companies that advertise on FB (ie, all of them) have dedicated data-science teams that analyze and confirm the ROI for those ad buys.  They aren't just taking Zuck's word for it.
While FB does have many problems, such as those you mentioned, that doesn't mean that it's grossly overvalued.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:00:46
Married couples often discuss long-term investments and financial actions with each other.  If you mingle your finances together, then it's just respectful to "check" (or "consult" to use a less loaded word).  A hundred bucks worth of BTC, yeah sure whatever, go for it unless your budget is really that tight.  A couple thousand bucks worth?  Don't be an asshole... just because you're into crypto doesn't mean your partner is.
@_date: 2018-07-25 02:45:30
This is so stupid.  
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:31:50
I dunno.  Random chance?  [Frequency illusion?]  (  The "domineering bitch wife / submissive dope husband" is pretty common trope in media and culture.
Personally, I've certainly heard plenty of women say "Let me check with my husband."  My wife says it... sister... mother... in-laws.... firends...
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:05:39
"Intrinsic Value" is a defined financial term.  It is not subjective.  There are plenty of reasons to use bitcoin, and those features may have 'value' to you... but that's not 'intrinsic value.'
@_date: 2018-07-26 18:02:41
Yep, UBI is not a silver bullet, and possibly not even critical to solving the problem.  Robot Tax is one possible workaround to the corporate tax problem you outlined.  You make a great point about:


The only thing I'd amend there, is that UBI didn't create that underclass, it was inevitable.  All else being equal, the only question is whether we end up the corpo-state you describe, or full on dystopian economic collapse.

Sure, except for the fact that it's overly simplistic at best, and wrong at worst.  He calls them "Jew Banks."  This is not a person who has an understanding of finance or economics.  It's a person with an axe to grind, who got votes by selling morons their own ignorance back to them.

Do you believe BTC will significantly increase in value?
@_date: 2018-04-12 20:12:50


Shorting means that you *borrow* btc to sell immediately.  If everything goes to plan, you buy back btc at a lower price to replace the btc you borrowed.  If btc goes down, then you pocket the difference.  If btc goes up, then you lose.  If it goes up enough, then your position gets "called" meaning you MUST close your short position and take the haircut.

Because I think their customers stopped harping about it.
I seem to recall that BTG was going to be handled similarly, but that obviously died off.  BCH was the first, and I think that lessons have been learned since all the shitcoins lost their shine early this year.

Your 2nd reply to me about "Jew bsanks [sic]."  I'm not going to quote it, since either you changed your mind or a mod found it offensive.

I wish there was a filter for Sam Harris wannabes who begin comments with names of logical fallacies.
Hell yes it's Ad hominem.  If Bloom is the only person advocating for your position, then you might be an asshole too.  If your position is strong and supportable, then maybe don't associate your movement with racist demagogues.  Failure to do so doesn't mean you're wrong, but it is indicative of an undeveloped philosophy and/or unrigorous reasoning.
In this specific video, he makes no arguments, only states his opinions as facts.  
* Financial crimes = crimes!
* Quantitative Easing = counterfeiting!    
* Fractional reserve banking = scam!
* Deposit Insurance = theft!
If you agree with those statements, then yay!
If you disagree, boo!
But there's no argument laid out, nothing to engage with.  And that's how demagoguery works.
