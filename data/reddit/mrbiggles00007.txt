I think it would be a mixture of both extremes, its a bit much for any law agency to believe that someone is just going to receive the entire amount into one account and walk off into the sunset.
If they decide that say 30% of the bitcoin will be randomly given away &amp; in amongst those accounts are real accounts from the thief then it creates a huge mess of accounts for them to try and untangle.
that is what I would do, maybe give away 150K to random accounts, some large amounts in amongst them and I would have perhaps 100 accounts out there that were my own and would enter this competition.
They would not be cumulatively traceable to an individual.
It also gives the effect of being instantly liquid because nobody is going to question taking say 3 bitcoin you won in a competition out because that is what anyone would do.
So you could drip feed yourself bitcoin for months or years and not really raise any suspicion.
I should have been successful in life..........

It is a catch 22, it could never be popular or main stream because then it would be worth someone inventing a scanner that auto scans painting &amp; posters. It would be more fun than mining for gold &amp; of course once someone has them, they are gone so its a bit of a risk.

You do not think the digitisation of currency enables greater long term control by the elite?
It is the wild west at the moment but you watch over the next 20 years as little by little the walls start closing in.
Nothing beats cash or even better, gold for maintaining control of your own finances without record &amp; reasonably anonymous although one has to ask how long before at the very least, high denomination notes have built in WiFi responders that can be tracked

Good strategy, worst thing this guy can do is to listen to people doing nothing about what he is doing wrong.
He is taking a risk &amp; I am sure if it fails there will be plenty who never put their balls on the line for anything ready to tell him where he went wrong or how dumb he is.
Still he has a better chance at success than most

Anonymity - no ties between you and the seller combined with they combine all individual offers into one search plus they are cheaper than some of the bigger organisations

Same but that is much less stringent than requiring bank accounts linked &amp; 2 forms of photo id

Can someone put this in a way that is say 6 levels down so normal people can understand what this means yet without making us feel inferior?
