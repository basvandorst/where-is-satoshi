Don't forget to mention Blockstream:
"We are against the block size increase, because it will destroy our business." /s

Nice catch.  casually placing it on top. haha

I agree with this.  Why not compromise?

I don't understand.  Any hard fork is gonna different from the bitcoin core, so what is a "standard" hard fork then?

Nobody agrees with you.  It is obvious you have some sort of conflict of interest because nobody even believes that you believe the shit you're saying.  BitcoinXT is not altcoin.  it is so obvious you stand to benefit if the block size remains the same and number of transactions reach the limit.  You remind of this quote: "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on not understanding it."

Wow, what a load of shit.  I can't even believe you believe the shit you are saying.  You clearly have an ulterior motive of some kind.

another head in the sand
what he's saying is anything deviating from 1mb block size is "altcoin" in his mind. christ

I fucking knew it.  Nice casual mention of "Lighting network."  Conflict of interest and nothing more here.  I am leaving the sub as you wish.  I recommend everyone do the same.

This, unfortunately.

Still makes me sad.

I scanned the QR code and message said I got the $5, but it's not showing up in my account or the transaction history.  
Edit: When I checked back couple hours later, $5 showed up in my account.  Thanks for free money!
