Consider yourself lucky. I already RMA'd my monitor for dead pixels.

yeah, obviously its CEO
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:05:27
That was so sad but so true

It is definitely a theory but it is not illogical and it's not even far fetched. He halted withdrawals because of TM. That implied there was theft or at least that there could. An a gag order is a serious thing. If you have made a deal and violate that you possibly lose all the btc and go to jail.

So its a news bug
@_date: 2014-02-28 03:09:33
This is a really good idea. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:08:50
Yeah I know he is an ass. But that doesn't mean he wants to hurt bitcoin, lose everyone's money, and go to jail. Think about it. If this theory was true how would you handle it differently. Honestly.

Thanks. So strange. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:44:59
lol.  that was funnier than the comic.  someone needs to creates a bitcoin subreddit that posts this on every gox post.  please don't downvote me.  i'm joking.
@_date: 2014-02-09 04:26:34
Sorry but what is that picture?
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:59:46
Ha ha. I like how everyone's identical comment gets upvoted except for yours. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:37:55
Come to think of it I wonder if bitcoins were actually stolen that way. Hack in, change your balance, and withdraw. Anyone propose that theory yet?  Uh oh, did I just kill a puppy?
@_date: 2014-02-12 20:00:42
I think you just proved their point
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:33:13
Well, technically speaking it is still insider trading by definition.  It's just not illegal.  
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:18:33
I don't get it.  What's wrong with ghash.io?  They have great deals.
Edit : it was a joke!!!!!  Geeze!!!  Didn't you get the idea of this post?
@_date: 2015-07-31 03:28:17
Maybe I'm not understanding what you mean but this doesn't make sense. It's an exchange so whenever you are selling a bitcoin you are trading on the other side with someone who has fiat. The rising price has nothing to do with it. 
Some crap went down for sure but this isn't the explanation. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:30:21
The truth here!  You are missing the opportunity to lie in both directions though. Even if you make a ton you can say "well, yeah, the profit is interesting, but really, that's never what I cared about.  I just wanted to change the system."
