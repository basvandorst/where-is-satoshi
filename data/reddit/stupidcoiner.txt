how is it too slow for retail transactions when it is already used for retail transactions?
digital security? bitcoin is not less secure than paypal or online banking.
and there are already escrow services. thanks to multisig, escrow is a builtin feature of the bitcoin protocol.
i hope this is like your first week in the bitcoin world. you have much to learn.
@_date: 2014-02-10 17:50:10
devs are working on a way to add data to transactions but you don't want to use that for simple messages but rather as a proof of existance for contracts, etc.
@_date: 2014-02-10 17:44:26
not true. all the panicking children already sold all their coins, that's why the price is so low.
when they realize "mtgox is insolvent" is as fake as "china banned bitcoin" and "ghash is secretly forking the blockchain" they'll panic buy again.
what you said would make sense if people weren't stupid but they are.

good job creating a fake account to agree with yourself.
@_date: 2014-02-10 17:54:05
i don't think they have everyone's bitcoin but as we saw their cold storage seems to be *really* cold so the coins there should be safe.
the only way mtgox could be insolvent to a point where they can't cover the losses with their private profits now is
1. they lost their cold storage keys
2. they did what some exchange/tumbler operator once did: constantly move funds from cold to hot storage where they got stolen until no cold storage coins were left.
(1) is possible but unlikely, (2) is just plain ridiculous because accessing cold storage is so difficult for them.
@_date: 2014-02-12 01:47:25
not sure if ironic?
i'm sorry I wasn't around in 2011. so his cold storage was hacked once?

stop downvoting this, assholes, are you fucking retarded?
yes, QR codes allow for error correction, but even if the finger isn't the only reason for the failed scan it might still contribute to it.
i.e. &lt;low resolution with finger&gt; is worse than &lt;low resolution without finger&gt;
if you know for sure that the image still wouldn't scan if there was no finger then please explain why.

temporary downvote until OP provides proof and more info.
isn't there some virus that modifies addresses in memory or something? what OS are you using?
nothing you can do unless you can find out who owns the address.
@_date: 2014-02-10 17:34:10
it was. the law enforcement guy was the one suggesting to kill the victim and the victim was a drug dealer who got busted in the process (because the drugs were delivered by police instead of post) and who then worked with the feds.
at least that's what i got out of some summary. I'm sure if you google you can find more.
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:01:30
we should make sure they get a proper education and learn to think for themselves so they don't fall for ridiculous strawman fallacies.
none of the problems mtgox is having is related to bitcoin or anonymity.

this is what happens when we don't teach children that google only knows as much as we tell them.
teach your kids to use OTR chat clients, startpage or duckduckgo, DoNotTrackPlus, NoScript and sometimes Tor Browser and they will grow up knowing that *they* are the ones in charge, regardless of how much money gets pumped into the NSA.
it's about as difficult as learning how to find your way through a new city - everyone can do it.
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:49:47
that account was inactive the entire time and now magically got active in i admit my evidence is weak but not as weak as the strawman in your OP, so i'd say I'm not lowering standards here.
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:46:37
how did this garbage even make it to the frontpage?
all the points raised by OP and in this thread are either already solved, soon to be solved or utterly ridiculous.
also false dilemma, strawman, etc.
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:31:40
ah, wasn't sure whether you were a stupid bitcoiner or a stupid troll. thanks for clarification.
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:07:41
yeah i totally agree with you.
i recently lost all my money when i gave it to this shady guy who promised me he'd pay me back double. 
all my friends advised me against it for several years so obviously i didn't listen to them and still gave my money to that guy and then he ran off with it and now those dickhead asshats who i thought were my friends refuse to reimburse me for my losses!!!11
FUCK THIS COMMUNITY!!!!! 
I WANT TO GET RICH QUICK BUT WITHOUT RISK, IF BITCOIN DOES NOT OFFER THIS THEN IT IS OBVIOUSLY A FAILED PROJECT WITH A SHITTY COMMUNITY!!!!!!

bitcoin is 5 years old and you actually still have to ask for use cases? are you kidding me? have you until last week lived on a desert island with no internet connection or something?...
@_date: 2014-03-05 04:00:37
yes but they all belong to the same group and Moh hates all of them as much as bitcoin because he is insane or gets paid for it.
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:12:03
look if you can't even be bothered to read the FAQ and a few wiki pages which would have answered all your wrong assumptions then what are you even doing here?
wait 5 years and come back when bitcoin is as easy as credit cards but please stop being annoying now, ok?
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:46:16
yes this would work. it'd obviously require custom software and would only work sometimes but this is how you can abuse this.
luckily mtgox only has a small fraction of their coins in hot storage and it is very difficult (impossible?) to anonymously abuse this exploit after all the verification documents they require, so this is a just another non-issue.
i don't really see the point of your post as all this was explained in length already.
@_date: 2014-03-05 04:03:37

yes but we always knew bitcoin wasn't banned.
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:25:13
exactly :D
and look at your downvotes - trolls and shills are strong today.
i don't think any real shibes hate on btc, it's just the pump&amp;dump spammers who are spreading the hate when it benefits them. but i haven't seen any of those recently.
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:31:59
it always amazes me to see how "liberal" has an entirely different meaning in the USA compared to europe.
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:54:46
yes but we are not brainless idiots falling for false dilemma fallacies spammed on by shills and trolls but instead realize that this isn't a winner-takes-all game.
if it was, there would only be either banks or paypal or moneychanger or neteller or western union, but not all of them.
which means bitcoin doesn't have to destroy every single bank in the world to be successful.
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:10:33


it's obvious you haven't. fuck. off.
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:59:53

if you seriously think there is any chance at all that hackers managed to anonymously steal enough coins from mtgox's hot wallet that these coins can't be reimbursed from mtgox's profits/investors then i'd recommend to you.

that was just a short era in which the conservatives were afraid of the left/pirate parties and *acted* as if they wanted to improve things.

afaik the problem mainly exists because the reference client's API sort of pushes developers into the direction of using txid's to verify transactions.
