This is extremely short sighted. First because there are far more reasons people live in poverty. Second, if one's parents are poor, and grows up in pauvrety, the moment one becomes independant it's very unlike they will not be poor.
Now, I do agree that debt is definitely not the way out.

Let's do some math... 6$/h * 20h/week (even though that 5h more than recommended while studying). Working 50 weeks a year... that's 6000$/year, I'd hardly call this rich.

I meant for OT in general not the MultiBit integration specially, sorry.

I was dubious at first (couple years back I think), they only offered their client, didn't publish the source. No intel at all. After a while all I found was that "the owner" was good people. Hmmk doesn't say much... But the other day I noticed riseup seems to have reviewed their code since they mentioned using it. Looking back I noticed they now openly say you can connect with any openvpn client and give out the source. I was pleased.

Because highschool kids usually make 50$/h right?

Yeah no one is born poor duh! /s

I think you got me wrong, I reposted your images to imgur for all's convenience and pointed out how much imgshack sucks, that is all :)
EDIT: The bold part was just some friendly copyleft sarcasm :]

So far the one thing I've understood is that escrows and payments are somehow scriptable so you could have say an email address where Bob must send a faxed copy of the smog test. This address could be an automated validator or an external third party. Don't take my word for it though, but if I get that right that sounds sweet.

No paranoia, Google does tailor your results to your needs (according to them).

Node JS would be excellent for this! Event based for high volume automated accounts, JS so easy to pickup, etc...
@_date: 2012-01-24 03:12:41
I take full blame, I did tag it, sorry.
@_date: 2012-04-17 13:33:36
Because high school jobs on minimum salary will definitely bring you out of poverty... yep...

MOAR Cryptocurrency! Yes please! (no sarcasm, I believe Bitcoin is just a start). I haven't had time to fully dig into Open Transactions yet and it's a bit on top of my head to be honest. Is there a testnet type thing to try it out?
@_date: 2012-01-19 01:04:15
My bad, I read that somewhere around here.
