Hey, 
We will try and make a 32bit windows release soon.
@_date: 2014-08-28 18:42:26
Would be in the future
@_date: 2014-10-20 05:45:51
Thanks !
All suggestions are very welcome !!
@_date: 2014-08-28 13:14:17
Its really easy and cool !
We put tons of time and energy in making it the best UI possible. 
Just to give an example, spending coins is just as u would expect, even easier ! Paste an address or type a OneName user into the address field, hit send and when u get a notification in your phone just click "authorize". thats it !
@_date: 2014-12-01 07:03:15
Thanks !

I think bitcoinj will support Trezor in their HD version, so yes, we will probably integrate it as well :) 
@_date: 2014-08-28 14:25:17
We will upload a site soon.

We should probably add it to the read me file. 
Once paired, the wallet and Authenticator exchange an AES key between them that is used to encrypt the communication. 
A new tx is created in the wallet which sends it to the Authenticator for signing, once the Authenticator sends the signed tx, the wallet will sign and broadcast it.
@_date: 2014-08-28 19:39:59
Push notifications are used only to let the app know it has pending requests from the wallet (like a new Tx to sign). 
The signing itself and the authorization is done P2P

We are days away from our soft release, just making sure everything works and ready.
Would u want to participate in the soft release ?
@_date: 2014-08-28 14:53:26
We had great support and help from the bitcoinj team !
@_date: 2014-11-30 21:29:42
Thanks, we invested a lot of time and effort in it :)
@_date: 2014-08-28 19:37:01
Currently 2 of 2
@_date: 2014-08-29 07:09:18

Its simple, our project is designed so you could keep all your bitcoins (your wages, pension, savings, etc.) in a very secure and trustable manner, not depending on any service or anyone. It should be your new standard of personal security (the same as paper wallets are a standard for backup).
the multisig copay solution is great if you want to open a multisig address with some friends, colleges or any other use. In other words, if you want to collect money for an office party (handled by a party comity), copay is a very cool solution. If you want to be sure your savings/ pension/ etc. are 100% secure no matter what, Bitcoin Authenticator is the perfect solution.
@_date: 2014-08-28 18:28:21
The wallet's and Authenticator's keys are all recoverable in various ways (file, SSS, paper wallet).
We have give a lot of thought about it and implemented a cool restore mechanism.
@_date: 2014-08-28 18:43:40
Thanks Mike !
@_date: 2014-09-29 13:35:57
Cool, just send me a mail and i'll send you an invite when we release :)
@_date: 2014-08-29 07:08:09
The plugin section needs work still, we will let you guys know. 
In the meanwhile, if you are a programmer u can contact me directly and we can talk about it, shouldn't be a problem.
@_date: 2014-10-22 10:34:58
Thanks !
@_date: 2014-12-01 07:02:50
It is based on mycelium's implementation
@_date: 2014-08-28 19:42:57
If you lose your device you can simply restore the whole wallet from the seed, we implemented nice solutions for it.
@_date: 2014-08-28 12:09:07
What we do:
We developed the first decentralized P2P multisig 2 factor authentication wallet to keep your coins safe.
Our project is 2 fold:
1) A cool desktop wallet (with the best UI the community ever saw) with cool features like accounts, advanced backup capabilities, OneName, Coinshuffle and other great integrations.
2) An android Authenticator app that has its own key hierarchy, seperate from the desktop wallet.
The 2 applications are synced with a simple QR code to create a Pay-To-Hash addresses with multisig protection. To redeem the coins, the desktop wallet and the Authenticator app need to sign the transaction together. Everything is done automatically and seamlessly, and most importantly, P2P.
Multisig protection should be used by everyone to protect their coins as a standard.

upnp is a known issue for us, make sure your computer and smartphone are on the same network or port forward port 1234 (will change soon)
@_date: 2014-08-28 14:56:55
hahha .... i actually blame myself as well, still a great song though !
@_date: 2014-08-28 14:23:42
Thanks !
We did thought of remote control, we would love to integrate such functionality in the future.
@_date: 2014-08-28 12:54:46
Hey, we are working on it but you could just switch the safety box at the bottom of the page (the youtube video link)
@_date: 2015-05-28 05:42:31
Just ordered one !
Great job guys !

Alpha version is available for download at 
@_date: 2015-01-03 07:36:54
Hey, its Alon from the bitcoin authenticator team.
We do not force the wallet to connect through TOR, its just the default setting. You can switch back anytime you choose.
@_date: 2015-01-03 12:18:00
We are working hard on the code and all the testing involved so the next version (v0.2) will be stable. Thanks for your support !
@_date: 2015-01-03 12:24:57
Both for the desktop platform and the authenticator app
@_date: 2015-01-03 12:22:58
We believe that when 2 or more independent devices are paired together to create multisig, a very strong personal security level can be achieved (if implemented in a decentralised way like bitcoin authenticator). In the future other device combinations will be available, including HD wallets like Trezor.

Thats exactly the aim of our project, creating a high quality decentralised security. Because you can create 2 factor accounts (we use a very cool account system), a hacker will need to find the 2 or more paired devices you use and then hack both of them in order to compromise your coins. Not an easy task at all !
@_date: 2015-01-26 17:20:22
So you are for a centralised solution where a 3rd party service does security for you ?
@_date: 2015-01-03 12:23:44
Will be available in the future
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:48:21
I'll start:
1) An automated manual solution, in which handling of security and privacy is done locally but in an automated way.
2) Advantages: decentralised, attackers are forced to compromise every wallet independently, we can't know how well 3rd parties protect our keys or do privacy.
Disadvantages: much harder to develop, backup
3) Why i think it should win: We as end users have no idea if the service we choose to keep our bitcoins safe has done a proper job. Two 16 year olds can develop such a service that looks good but we don't have any way of judging if its really secure. Bitcoin Tx are irreversible so if the service we choose is compromised, thats it. The only reasonable choice is making a local solution that is completely automated and does not require any technical know how.
