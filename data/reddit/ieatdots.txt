It's easy...$1.9B is just over twice the amount of the illegal drug money they were caught laundering red-handed. Pretty easy to comprehend in that context actually...

Genuinely ignorant. An "expert" should be comfortable talking and answering reasonable questions about his subject matter. 
Actually I hope this is just a case of public speaking issues. Some smart people turn into blathering morons in front of a large group.

The docs say its only enabled on a short list of subs, yet I see you tipping on funny and ELI5. Is it enabled reddit-wide now?
EDIT: Derp, I just read further. With a 2 BTC tip to the bot you can tip in any sub.

as well. I guess make your own call, sorry if I was sensationalizing, but it's pretty outrageous in my opinion.

Right, but the TF2 economy dwarfs these by a large margin. TF2 is the game economy that Varoufakis was "drafted to help sort out".

This ROUGH analysis was done last year placing the value of the whole economy around $50m: 
Also interesting are backpack.tf's top backpacks. Their values for each item are of course not dead-on accurate, but are determined by member voting. Note that "buds" are currently worth ~$32, so the top 20 people are currently sitting on $10k+ of virtual goods. 
If I'm not mistaken, there isn't an MMO out there that can even begin to touch this. This isn't just theoretical value either, cash trades are happening constantly, every day.

TF2 is an MMO game now?

Was that your comment? Because you put it as part of the quote. Yeah there are a few of those people that are actually scammer-scammers, most are just "sharks" who take advantage of people's ignorance to make a profit. 
I'd guess tf2whx volumes are very low if I had to speculate. I think it's mostly because people don't know about it. It used to at least have a link on the main tf2wh site, but they just removed it. There's also a 2.5% fee when selling creds for BTC that probably deters people. 
Most TF2 cash trades are done with paypal, etc.

Isn't cloudflare fucking FREE? Why doesn't everyone AT LEAST use cloudflare for such a DOS-sensitive application?
