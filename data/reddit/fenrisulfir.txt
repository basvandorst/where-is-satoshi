I've lost 42 bitcoins over two years. Somehow, I'm not as proud.  It's all about stimulating the economy, right?
@_date: 2015-04-19 11:29:32
Through being greedy and stupid alt trades.  Bought 35.  Invested in AM when it wasn't a scam.  Got +7.  Then lost 4.  Really wanted 40 because so close and nice round numbers.  Started losing more.  Started making dumb (ie, riskier) trades.  And now I sit at &lt;1 cuz I've been buying things with my one remaining BTC.
TL;DR Because I am the dumb.

So inside the eyelids would have to be upside down and backwards because of the mirror.  I hope doesn't contain a lot of 'd', 'b', or 'p'.
It kinda bothers me that this was my first thought and that it seemed like the most logical place to store 150+ BTC.

My bad.  Is an Internet worth 10mBTC now?

Oh for sure.  I was just curious about the, "Just a couple bucks per month." quote and if that was still accurate.
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:57:37
That's handy.  So it looks like it's closer to 60K assuming they used a logical order numbering system.  Why does it say the MiniRig is only 90K GH/s?  I thought it was supposed to do 1.5M GH/s.  At 5 units per day and 60K queue size, I'll get one in 32 years.  Seems about right.  Wonder what the difficulty will be by then.

I read somewhere that many people in the queue haven't paid yet.  Was it possible one time to do COD or was I misinformed?  If it's true, would someone be able to skip closer to the front of the line if they paid upfront or would they still be at the end and just a little poorer?

I don't get that problem at all.  I just went there and watched a few random videos.  Some 10 minute staff picked video on their homepage fully buffered right away (in HD by default instead of YouTubes 360p), much faster and smoother than YouTube.  My connection is 150/10.
I also find it is usually much higher quality than YouTube (especially the comments).  I enjoy the entire experience on the Vimeo site much more compared to YouTube.  Odd that we have polar experiences with the same site.

No because these cost bitcoins to buy so if the price of bitcoins rockets to $1000 each, he should've just kept his bitcoins.
With the tiny hashrate of these things relative to the rate of change of the difficulty multiplied by the cost of electricity, no he won't make a profit.
The trick is to sell them on ebay and buy bitcoins now that we're down to &lt;$90
@_date: 2013-10-08 21:50:02

Does this seems dumb to anyone else or am I misinterpreting something?  I can make 100% accurate recommendations too if we're talking about the past.
Why only do 120 days of history?  I recommend that everyone get into Bitcoins the instant they first hear about them in '09/'10 and then sell them when they hit $260.

Have you tried Cavirtex?  I got in there in the summer and it only took a week tops to go from signing up to having 35 BTC in my account. And by week I mean 5 days, sign up, submit ID, wait for confirmation, get error, correct error, resubmit, cash verified, transfer money, buy bitcoins.
