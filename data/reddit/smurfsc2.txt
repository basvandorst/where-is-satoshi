Anyone want a 2006 Nissan 350z GT, 40k miles. Only looking for 1 BTC

I'm not sure if they created bitcoin or not. What I do know is that the guy doing the tandem skydive did not listen to the brief, his body position is awful

Do you know how to code? If not then I suggest starting with that �� 
Then choose an exchange with an API (I use coinfloor) and get programming :)

how did you manage to run the sql?

I've been running a bot (created by myself) for the past month. There are plenty of people doing it

are your stats showing that people are still trying to crack this? Or has everyone gave up now?

Ive thought the same myself. But then i have the realisation that i would have to put a massive investment into it. Imagine someone comes on the first day and sticks a whole bitcoin on a number and wins, you now have to pay out 35 btc.

Why not?

What website are you using here?

Every time we get a new all time high we get the same question. Put it this way, right now nobody that has ever bought and held bitcoin has lost money.

Ive always used localbitcoins, never had a problem.
The minimum deposit amount on coinfloor is a bit high for me at the moment
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:57:39
I got the exact same thing.
Seems like a bitcoin related site that we both signed up too may have sold emails/had their database compromised

When (if) the butterfly labs systems get released wont it just cause a massive influx of bitcoins causing prices to drop until the difficulty increases? And once it has increased wont it make GPU mining pretty much pointless?
