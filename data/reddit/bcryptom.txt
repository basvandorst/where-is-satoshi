Well, in a recent interview ex NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg referred to ‘blockchain’ as ‘bitchain’ so your mom can be forgiven!

Certainly the original Reuters headline overstated what is actually happening on the ground. Having said that, SK is clearly beginning to curb speculative cryptocurrency trading, which is a big shift from where we were 2 months ago.  This is probably the biggest reason for why BTC isn't trading at $20k right now.

I think a portfolio consisting of BTC, LTC, ETH, DASH, and XMR makes a lot of sense, especially given how cheap the ratios have become of late.

I've gone back and forth on this and overall can't convince myself whether this will be a bullish or bearish event for BTC.  I think if BTC was still at the price when chatter of a BTC futures market first started (which was back in April when BTC was trading at about $1500), I'd say there might be a ton of buying interest.  Instead, it seems to me like we have basically priced in BTC futures demand before the futures market actually starts trading.  Perhaps this will end up being a 'buy the rumor sell the news' sort of event.  Really hard to tell.  The other interesting question is if arb traders emerge to trade the spread between the futures and actual BTC market.

To be clear, no one is really sure if they are printing USDT or simply meeting customer demand for USDT.  An audit surely would answer a lot of questions, and the fact that they haven't released one suggests something is amiss.

This is some bad news:

Kraken is basically unusable right now from where i'm standing.

But they wanted to do it 3 months ago?  And now all of a sudden they don't?  I don't think that's it....
