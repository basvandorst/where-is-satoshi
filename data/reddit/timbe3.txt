You mean $40k?  Was meaning $20-30k within a day if they bought during the crash.
It might not help, but.. better than nothing I guess.

It wasn't that long ago (roughly 5 months) when ETH flashed from $319 to $0.10... it rebounded back to $320ish in a day and now it's in the $400's. Anyone lucky enough to buy in at the crash would easily be sitting on $20-30K for every dollar of coins they bought.
I completely missed that.. but now have a notification set up to let me know if the price in any of the main cryptos drop more than 10% and my phone's alarm will go off if it drops more than 50%.

A really large sell order

So BTC150M is a bad idea for a plate..
Clearly that's not me,I bought in at 9,800ish but still.

Same here!

You shush with your infallible logic and "math".. 
Also, I drink a lot apparently, and concede.

Pay down the debt. 
If you absolutely have to get Bitcoin, set a $100 or so aside to make a small purchase. Worst case scenario you have paid off $4.9k in debt and lost a $100. Best case scenario, you pay of $4.9k in debt, Bitcoin hits $1m and you walk away with nearly $10k.

Looks like you had the range about right..

Exchanges sell Bitcoin for different rates. So you buy bitcoin on exchange x for say, $16,000 then transfer the Bitcoin to exchange Y and sell it for $16,500. If all goes well you make a clean $500 profit per BTC.
The problem, however, is that is a lengthy process and who knows what will happen during the time it takes to confirm. That said, it can be worthwhile if you have a decent chunk of change to play with, but it's not really worth the risk if you are at 0.01or 0.1.

Not necessarily. The price will go up and down based on demand. So if the person was selling and there were more people trying to sell than buying, it could result in the price dipping. However, if there are more people buying than selling the price could go up, regardless of how many a single person sold.

Unfortunately, this is the incorrect part. SEC employees, at least the ones that have access to this sort of information, have jobs that pay $100-200K (
This sets them up for jobs that pay $250-500K.

I mean... it's almost like every time someone finds a way to detect/stop manipulation a new way is found to get away with it. 
Maybe it would be easier/better to just let it happen and force the market to adapt to itself.

I meant that as more of a retorical question. But fully agree.
