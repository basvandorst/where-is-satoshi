Yeah... Tried to withdraw the last of my BTC 48 hours ago and nothing - support request hasn't been assigned or responded to for over 24 hours either..... Not feeling too swell. All I'm left with is an empty account and some anxiety.

Final edit:
This is not fake. I was duped by the above commenter.

You guys have really helped here. Thanks. If any bills start rollin' I don't know if you want me to post here or if there's someone else I should talk with about any grassroots stuff.

Eric's a personal friend. I'm pretty sure Daniel Zolnikov had some bitcoin contributions come in (might be worth asking) and he should win; I also received a political contribution in Dogecoin.... I didn't really promote it a lot and it was small enough that the name/etc of the person who contributed didn't need to be reported (I think it was the equivalent of a few cents if I remember).

OP will examine that legislation. In a dream world I would like to allow cryptocommerce without capital gain taxation. (i.e. You buy X at $500; never convert back to USD; don't have to keep track of all your purchases and prices if value goes up). Although I think you still might have to for IRS purposes.

Hey guys. I've been in the same boat since Jan 25 too.
@_date: 2014-02-01 16:19:45
I hope so. Sittin here since Jan 25.

Holy cow. This comment is a treasure trove of useful information. Thank you. Our commissioner of political practices issued an opinion greenlighting all crypto contributions. Shoot me an email please - we'll be in touch.

I'm on my 12th day without the withdrawal going through; given no ETA for successful withdrawal; one member of support on IRC indicated coins might be refunded into my gox account (not withdrawal address) on day 19 if continues.

After a lot of PM'ing and whatnot the hard evidence looks like there are definitely support workers still at Gox and withdrawals happening - albeit with delays. 
I will drop a note here when I hear back on support on the real channel and when withdrawal comes through. Schwad Always Delivers.

I'm on 7 days. Not alone. That's kind of what's been goin on.
@_date: 2014-02-03 19:12:55

I'm not alone.

Thank you, . I know we're just a state but having a low population our policy is a tad more flexible than DC.

Let's try this again - 
Without the blue coverup.     
This all came about from a requested BTC withdrawal on Saturday and a support ticket that has yet to be assigned or answered   
also sounds possibly credible. 
**Even if is an account that never was employed by mtgox, which I doubt, there is still a serious problem going on with BTC withdrawals right now.** However the account does look legit.

Share it with your state legislators too. The volume of emails/phonecalls we get is far less, the likelihood we read it/pick up the phone is far higher, and a lot of what we spend our time doing is contacting the Congressional Offices to let them know what federal/national issues our constituents are concerned about. 
At least that's what we *should* be spending our time doing!

That does sound like fun. I'd have to talk to the right folks to make sure it's done properly.

What have I done.
