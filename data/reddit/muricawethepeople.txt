The problem with being a "True Believer" in anything is that you cannot be unbiased. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:41:08
The point is that it is not their property and they shouldn't mess with stuff that isn't theres.
@_date: 2014-01-11 00:03:24
It is a crime. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 04:04:50
Proof of claim? 
@_date: 2014-05-02 07:56:56
You can buy shares of gold and photocopy the image on your computer so actually you can store good futures and a good claim in your computer 
@_date: 2014-09-03 07:56:03
Because bitcoin has never been stolen.

I guess, it is just odd to have to rely on internet if the US were to collapse in said doomsday "Everyone listen to ron paul and buy gold" scenario.
@_date: 2014-03-14 07:45:31
Thank you for the BTC friend :) 
@_date: 2014-01-16 05:01:21
Question about "Fiat" since BTC isn't backed by anything, isn't it just as dangerous as the USD, perhaps more dangerous because it would take the collapse of the US govt. to take down the dollar?
@_date: 2014-01-16 04:57:23

@_date: 2014-02-04 09:09:47
There is no tipping of criticism here :( 
@_date: 2014-03-12 05:34:36
No one tips bitcoin anymore, they used to but I have not even seen a btc tip in a long time. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:29:02
Take off your tinfoil hat and listen to yourself for a moment. 
You think that there are not a shitload of other stories going on right now? Ukraine, Iraq, Afghanistan, various rights ect. 
and they are going to risk their reputation for bitcoin, a niche market at best?  
@_date: 2014-01-11 02:16:49
Which I never get anyway! 
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:03:28
Get ready for:
- This is good for bitcoin because
- The market is just adjusting
- We have been through tougher
- we are still up from a few months ago. 
- LOL DAE Seen this before. 
- Downvoting all real but bad news about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 03:46:34
I love dogecoins :)
@_date: 2014-05-02 08:02:29
People around here are greedier than they used to be. Tipping is dead, accept it.

They don't accept bitcoin either though....
@_date: 2014-01-16 08:10:38
Various govt. regulations.
@_date: 2014-01-18 03:42:59
That will look great in 20 years when BTC is forgotten.

Entrapment means that they had to have overcome some resistance. 
If I create a situation for you to commit a crime and you do it it isn't entrapment. 
**NOT** entrapment:
"Hey friend, want to sell drugs for me?"
"Hey Friend, want to sell drugs for me?"
*"No, I don't like that idea"*
"Come on man, please!"

I am only half joking, if I could figure out mining I would totally have some dogecoins.
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:44:02
For some reason the idea of a bitcoin money clip is odd to me. 
Unless it is a paper wallet. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:58:27
Buy or Faucet. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:47:38
The Swiss is also famous for anonymous bank so it could still go either way, since banks are a huge part of their economy.
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:03:56
Well, easy come easy go.
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:50:51
Second Idea (someone else feel free to animate this and take the credit, I want to know how this would look).
Bitcoin with angel wings flying above fiat currencies. 
The bitcoin is brighter than the other and may or may not feature a ray of sunlight shining down on the bitcoin, leaving the other fiat currencies in the bitcoin's shadow, essentially in the dark. 
EDIT: Again, I am not an artist, feel free to animate this one and take the credit for it.
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:13:02
All this does is hurt the image of bitcoin 
You are just giving ammo to the people that say that bitcoin is only used for drugs!
EDIT: I am just saying buying drugs adds fuel to the fire. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:25:54
Gold is not a legal currency though. 
(Sorry if this seems like a dumb question)
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:51:09
Welcome to the wacky weird and often confusing world of investment. 
Now if we could get in on the forex market, then we made it! 
We wouldn't be a commodity, but a true currency. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:13:21
That is really pretty. 
Can you make one that is Red, White and Blue?
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:19:29
Well if I had a large amount I would still not be cashing out. 
I think it violates the spirit of it. 
It is a new currency not a tulip to sell off. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:35:47
Sadly, we will see more of these as BTC gets more famous. 
I hope he can get back on his feet. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:09:12
Ironically, the shirt cannot be paid for in bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:57:33
Now you treat it like any other forex. 
- Buy stuff with it
- Wait for it to go up in value
- give it away to a charity. 
- Enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:22:30
and lower your price, you are asking to make a video for $500. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:34:03
That makes more sense, thank you. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:46:35
Why not just have servers and operate outside the US to avoid US law enforcement?
(And use BTC to stay unique)
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:06:55
Sounds like a scam.

ENOUGH SPAM!
Please and thank you. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:38:32
Those could be useful. 
It would basically be a debt card for BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:49:26
You tried this before, I will tell you again.
Criminals like YOU give BTC a bad name. 
Last time you tried this: 
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:23:17
I am calling for people cleaning up bitcoin's image.
We need to show that we have uses besides illegal drugs.
Otherwise, we are just going to be seen as "the internet money that lets people buy drugs" and that is not what we want
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:43:08
I am thinking something along the lines of a "Bitcoin Accepted Everywhere" Style logo. 
(Kind of vague but just an idea)

Sorry, that would be:
6.96 British Pounds.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:30:34
It is for small businesses but I hope it helps. 
It is just a little "How-To" guide.
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:36:43
Shipping across state lines. 
Some are not going there. 
Even if it was legal, it looks bad for bitcoin, it looks like a black market currency.
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:47:55
As long as it is all legal, I am glad to see a business using BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:47:21
We are trying to improve the image of a new currency.
We don't want it to even look like you can buy drugs with it.
The credit card has been accepted, bitcoin has not yet. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:28:07
Personally, I would wait a little bit before going back on, they may have some issues now.
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:39:49
Well it could take a long time, but you could get BTC from faucets, but it takes a few hours to get even a little.
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:39:27
Nice try to get us to send you BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:50:02
I want one of those cards, but I have almost no bitcoins :( soon though, one day very soon.....
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:42:56
People like you damage BTC. 
We in the bitcoin community look down upon people using bitcoins for illegal means. 
You are damaging the reputation of bitcoins, shame on you. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:30:15
No problem and best of luck to you.
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:43:04
The only thing that should be changed so far that is really holding BTC back is that they are impossible to get. 
I don't know how to buy them, I was "Tipped" BTC, but I have NO idea how to buy them and I don't think most people do either.

@_date: 2013-12-12 21:02:01

I don't have a TV :(
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:26:39
still, $430 for a 2 min. custom video.
That is WAY too high. 
I have seen the same service on Fiverr, and that only costs $5. 
I am not saying your idea is bad, but your prices are through the roof. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:31:17
But the people who created BTC could in theory get in legal trouble?
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:30:20
Proof? 
(Sorry it is not that I don't trust you, I just don't trust anyone). 
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:32:09
As I said before, it is like preferred stock, you must have a certain amount invested and it is not available to everyone. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:08:55
It is a legal currency 
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:06:23
I can't tell you it is cheap, but here it is. 
You also can't pay in BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:40:14
Bitcoin Yellowish Gold.
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:48:54


So it is being treated a little bit like preferred stock?
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:49:59
A billion may be a little high, but I like the spirit of it. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:26:33
Right below "Cigarettes" 
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:35:40
As long as you have only been doing LEGAL transactions. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:50:17
Thank you :)  
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:54:52
I don't buy anything from criminals, especially bitcoins that are from ill gotten gains. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:49:39
Well you have served your purpose, bitcoin doesn't need any negative press right now. 
Silkroad is shut down and BTC has been doing fine. 
That cryptolocker shit has been giving BTC a worse name, and we don't need you trying to commit BTC crimes. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:50:16
Sweet I got cross posted :) I was the OP of that thread 
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:43:45
No begging. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:45:11
The dollar already has a reputation as currency, Bitcoin has to earn it, and it is criminals like YOU who are hindering bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 08:48:43
This asshole again? 
Knock it off, if you commuted a crime we don't want to help you. 
You are just a common criminal who gives bitcoin a bad name. 
People see bitcoin as a black market currency because of stuff like this.

What about micro transactions? 
if something only costs a few cents more. (Ex. Giftcard/BTC combined purchase).

No criticism of bitcoin ever!
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:52:30
Yes and no, 
You can send cash (as in paper money) to the jail to put in his account. 
That being said, it varies from prison to prison on whether or not sending money directly to an inmate is allowed, most will just send it back to you and say "sorry, banned item" if it looked unintentional. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:03:41
How much did you spend if you don't mind me asking?
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:17:08
Any decentralized currency would have been correct
@_date: 2013-12-12 12:55:55
Indian markets are similar to the Chinese Chinese in the sense that Indian businessmen will see this as the future if the gift doesn't ruin this for them. 
They are not as big though.
@_date: 2013-12-13 08:52:01
Well you insulted him so you must be right. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:17:55
I think it will stay stable around $1000 maybe drop to $700.

I commented pretty early and did not really check others.
