Most massively bullish thing for BTC in recent memory.

Trumps anti-BTC tweet is orders of magnitude more bullish than the fed chairman's comments.

I am very sorry for your loss, its so painful hearing about these things can't imagine how painful it is for someone who loved him.
Your brother was sick. He did not kill himself because of BTC, he killed himself because he was sick. BTC may have been a part of his life while he was sick, but he would have been sick if he hadn't ever even heard of BTC.
The real story is a guy with a mental health problem needed help and didn't get it in time. It's one of the most heartbreaking stories you can possibly hear. Unfortunately, it happens all the time. The real story has nothing to do with BTC.

Plenty of great things about a rural lifestyle and plenty of disadvantages to the urban one. There are tons of people living rural lifestyles in western countries like the USA (perhaps especially) where you also get the benefit of a rule-of-law-based government that doesn't consistently fuck you over with completely fucktarded monetary policy.

Dog the price is dropping because there are no more buyers. There are literally 100x as many traders as actual users of this stuff. Traders don't buy spot, and if they do it's gonna be at 5.9k in the near future not 7+. The retail investors that got into this to make money are all gone now. The HODLers are HODLing. The institutional investors aren't coming any time soon. There's no demand for Bitcoin. When there's no demand the price goes down!
Want the price to go up? There's really only a few things you can do (other than just directly dumping hundreds of millions of dollars into the spot market). One, you can help make Bitcoin better. Help develop wallets that dumb people can use and not lose all their money. Y'all realize that this stuff is unusable for stupid people right? Stupid people have money too. The other way is to just encourage adoption in general. When you sell something only accept Bitcoin. Support businesses that support Bitcoin (not the ones that instasell once you buy their stuff with BTC). Accept BTC as a payment at your business and offer a discount.
The last thing you can do is wait. Wait for people to give up and sell and the price to *really* hit rock bottom (we aren't close BTW), wait until all your nocoiner friends are laughing in your face, wait until the guy whose never used a financial instrument in his life is asking you how to short BTC. That's when the traders and institutional investors are gonna start turning into buyers. That's when there will be tons and tons of new demand. And as the price starts going up and up the retail investors all pile back in and create even more demand and we blast off.
The thing about futures is there was no way for institutions to short BTC before it, so they pump BTC up before futures, short, then dump the market to cash in on their shorts. It's an illiquid market and these things are going to happen. Gotta take the good with the bad and be patient and accept the market cycle.

Stupid, greedy owners who can't keep their greasy fingers out of players' money does not = ponzi scheme. They're not ponzi schemes, they had shitty owners who stole money or made the mistake of not keeping player and company money separate.

No he did not. Healthy people do not let missed chances of becoming a millionaire make them kill themselves, only sick people do. He was sick before that.

They have a more developed than average economy for the region aka some of their population doesn't raise camels and has a color TV. They're still under an authoritarian theocratic regieme. Not surprised they stifle economic growth and make terrible fiscal and monetary policy decisions.

Monero's centralized leaders unilaterally change the coin's PoW every 6 months in the name of "mining decentralization". The fact that they're too stupid to see past level 1 and realize NVIDIA+AMD &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bitmain+Dragonmint etc in terms of barriers to entry for endgame mining is another issue entirely, but the fact that they're able to unilaterally change the PoW by definition makes that coin centralized. I'm so tired of supposed Bitcoin maximalists being Monero apologists. Stop condoning their anti-capitalist practices and their patent centralization.

They sure have a hell of a choice, support this fork or stay on the old chain and lose all your money!
@_date: 2018-09-11 22:42:01


Disagree. The other cryptos *are* the enemy. They're centralized premined trash completely anti-cypherpunk ideology at best, at worst they're pure scams masquerading as tech startups but really they're just taking your money and partying their asses off with it while you sit and hold their worthless coins that have zero utility--they're just shares in a company that pay no dividends and the company does nothing useful. They're cancer to this space. They're taking dumb money, people whose eyes light up with greed when they see all the money OG BTC'ers made and want to duplicate that, and exploiting the fuck out of them by **STEALING** their money and handing them a worthless piece of shit shitcoin in return. It's a fucking disgrace and they need to all die. Bitcoin can only move forward if (among other things) it's completely disassociated with these scamcoins and centralized shitcoins. Until people realize they're being fucked and the only shelter in sight is Bitcoin, they're going to look at Bitcoin as only part of a whole and the fuckery that comes with that is gonna be associated with Bitcoin. We need these scams gone. This is absolutely a fight worth fighting. We have to clean up our own back yard before we go forward and conquer the neighborhood.

OK fair. Never say never etc. Still waiting on the first one, though, and for now since there aren't any good ideas yet adopting the position 'blockchain not bitcoin' without also proposing this alternate use case that makes sense is very silly. Agree?
@_date: 2018-08-20 00:23:18
Different things. Blockchain's censorship resistance resistance refers to the immutability of the data. If you put twitter on a blockchain a government that controls your access to the internet can still censor your ability to access it.
@_date: 2018-08-19 18:12:17
No. Why would you need a blockchain for any of that?
@_date: 2018-08-19 18:11:32


There hasn't been a good one yet.
EDIT: Wanna stress this. Tons of companies/startups/people spout these 'blockchain tech' ideas. They're all TERRIBLE ideas. It's always sort of 'lets take something that already works and try to slap a blockchain onto it', and using a blockchain to do the thing that already works would ALWAYS make the thing WORSE, NEVER BETTER. There literally is not a good idea for a blockchain use case that isn't money. I don't use the word literally without meaning it.
@_date: 2018-08-19 09:24:56
AA is right, anyone who fully understands what a blockchain is (and as a corollary what it does well and what it does poorly) would never say 'blockchain not bitcoin'. It's an incredibly ignorant thing to say. Blockchains are terrible for anything that doesn't require permissionlessness+censorship resistance. The only thing you need that for is store of value/money.
'Blockchain not bitcoin' just gets spouted by traditional investors that hear their bosses hum and haw about this newfangled magic internet money that they think is a scam--they just want to adopt a middle-of-the-road position that sounds smart, it's not--or shitcoiners that will believe any lie spread to them by the ppl shilling their pump/dump shitcoins.

They can beat pro players in heads up games only, the bot that did this took an unbelievable amount of computing power to accomplish this and still took tons of time to make each decision, often &gt; 45 seconds for flop/turn decisions. This wouldn't work for online poker. As you add more players the game tree grows exponentially. There's no effective bot against pro players for 3+ handed play, most online play is 6 or 9 handed. AI is extraordinarily powerful at solving complex games of complete information it lags behind significantly in games of incomplete information.
