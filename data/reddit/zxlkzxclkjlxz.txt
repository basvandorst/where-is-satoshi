Ok..... "I wanted to print out $1 of Bitcoin and give it away"

Wasn't there a post from a mod recently complaining about posts that have nothing to do with bitcoin?

Just think about this. They'll know. You'll be getting a visit.

Actually I reckon Bitcoin isn't punk, it's prog rock.....the endless debates e.g. about block size that never actually go anwhere or resolve anything, just like all those 48 hour long prog rock guitar / keyboard / drum solos...

I'd recommend Trezor over the Ledger wallet.
Listen to Thomas France, CEO of Ledger Wallet, talk about Ledger here:
Listen to him admit that in order to initialize the Ledger you MUST be using a non-compromised computer.  He says this at around 3mins 50s.
How is that a secure way of setting up a hardware wallet????

"Bitcoins - don't eat them" was John Cleese conclusion here:

stalactite, do you really think that all Bitcoin enthusiasts are anti-government anarcho-capitalist libertarians? Or if they aren't that they should be?

coins from before the fork would be valid in both chains. One of which is likely to die quickly.

The Bitcoin surge on the Greek drama did not came from the Greeks, but from ~~the rest of the world~~ current speculators in Bitcoin hoping the rest of the world was going to realise they are using the same system.
People are slowly catching on to Bitcoin, but to suggest 'the rest of the world' is turning to it is overly optimistic right now.

Right now I'd recommend using Trezor.  It's simple and about as safe as you can get. Keys never leave the Trezor, which signs transactions without revealing the private key to the computer it's plugged into.
With a single Trezor you can create multiple accounts, and/or multiple master seeds, to diversify where your bitcoins (more precisely, your private keys) are kept. 
With Trezor the thing to keep very safe is the master seed word list.

Thanks all for your answers.
My question was about a real situation, not theoretical.
The other person is not very computer literate, so suggesting they start using PGP is likely to not go down well. I don't think they will want to be bothered with trying to figure that out. They are more likely to suggest sending them the funds in fiat through more conventional means.  It's me that's trying to encourage using Bitcoin.
I will try the 'using multiple channels to communicate the bitcoin address' approach in combination with sending a test amount before the main transaction.
I think this whole area is one that will need to be simplified before Bitcoin is ready for mainstream use. I expect that will happen eventually.
