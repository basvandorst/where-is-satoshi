I don't think you understand the space.
Bitcoin is more like a protocol than a website.  Think of bitcoin like IP and think of layer2 as TCP &amp; UDP, then think of layer 3 as http, ftp, etc...
ethereum &amp; NEO are just another approach to a development stack where they say TCP/IP &amp; HTTP are all part of the same network layer.
OK, maybe that could work too..  seems more prone to bugs, but we'll see.

@_date: 2018-01-04 14:57:07
I understand that.  But I don't think you understand the concept of a simple clipboard attack.
If malware infects the host computer it can monitor the clipboard for crypto addresses then swap them out for hacker's address when pasting into the wallet software.  Unless the victim is VERY careful and pays very close attention to the addresses they may not notice that the address pasted is not the address copied and then they would authorize the transaction to the wrong address.
Do you understand the vulnerability?  It's very subtle.
Heck, the malware could be even more evil and monitor the host computer browser and rewrite the web page to alter the deposit address in exchanges so that the user wouldn't even know that the address was tampered with!

As a point of differentiation:  You don't need to buy a ledger from the factory, because it has a device encryption key within the secure element it can verify it's own integrity cryptographically via attestation.  Something the Trezor can not do.  This means you can be secure in owning a Ledger no matter where you bought it from.  
Make sure you generate the seed phrase ON DEVICE though, don't fall for the scam where someone inserts a fake seed card into the box and reseals it.  If you receive an already initialized device just reset it (enter pin wrong 3 times) and generate your own seed.

@_date: 2018-01-25 23:37:51
But shouldn't LN be smart enough to find additional peers even if they only connected to a hub?  Like bittorrent for example finds peers automatically without the user having to discover anyone manually.  End users are not going to know how to connect to peers manually, nor should they be expected to for mass adoption to work.
Is that not how LN works?
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:24:52
I understand perfectly how the device works.
What I don't think you understand is that if the host computer is compromised then it can have the browser hijacked and the address on the web page rewritten so that when you copy the deposit address from the exchange it is not what the exchange sent from their server and you have no way to know.

in the event of global financial crises where FDIC is insolvent i believe that ONLY bitcoin (and perhaps other cryptos with a strong track record) will be solvent.  They will skyrocket in value when measured against insolvent global currencies.  However, people will not view value in terms of fiat currencies then.  Groceries would be measured in BTC directly at that point as people will still need a unit of account for trade and if the fiat system collapses they will dump all their fiat into crypto.  See Venezuela for example.

no you don't.  So long as you perceive the value of bitcoin by the number of dollars it buys you then you are also assuming that the cost of everything that you can buy with dollars stays the same.  A loaf of bread costing $5 today would cost $5,000,000 with hyperinflation, therefor ruining any value that you would receive with newfound wealth in bitcoin.  What you really want is slow steady growth in crypto alongside fiat.  Honestly, the world needs both.  Governments need to be able to expand and contract their monetary supply, but be kept in check by a global reserve currency that isn't controlled by any nation.  That prevents endless wars and such since debts would have to be paid vs just print more money.

No, I don't see it that way at all.  When I see stuff like "Satoshi imagined.. etc." I think of a person(s) who spent a lot of time theorizing and planning and obsessing over Bitcoin, trying to anticipate the future and really theorizing about it a whole heck of a lot.  So along that lines one of the things Satoshi probably considered was "well, it's open source, what happens if someone makes a version that's different?" Then he gamed it out and came to the conclusion that the result is either tolerable to the system's survival or intolerable.  In the cases where it was intolerable he adjusted the framework until finally arriving at Bitcoin which is designed to be anti-fragile, not omniscient.  
Looking to Satoshi's design and notes isn't gospel, it's about getting inside the mind of the inventor because they have very deep insight to the inner workings and edge cases of the invention and they may have answers and solutions to current problems.  
I have a feeling Satoshi will show up again one day when Bitcoin is the global world reserve currency.  Until then he needs to remain in hiding to protect against being made an example of.

When it reaches $1m it will be impossible to switch units because it will be so widespread that change of social-cultural mneumonic will be impossible.  So my point is you only get one chance to switch.  Make it to the smallest functional unit in anticipation of the future.  I like bits, but I don't think they have to be called bits.  Just that whatever we call them should end in two zeros after the decimal just like money that people are already used to.  xxx.00  More than two zeroes is just weird for people unfamiliar to crypto.

Problem I see with PoS is that it has no external measure outside the system to keep it in check.  I'm not saying it cant work, but it's not tied to any physical laws then whereas PoW is tied to the physical universe and that is a good metric for security: entropy &amp; heat.  Still, if PoS can work I'm optimistic.  
@_date: 2017-02-14 01:12:02
Well, if a second implementation would be a menace to the network then it needs to be anticipated because building a second implementation that's intentionally buggy could otherwise be an effective way to sabotage the network.
Multiple different versions of the software by multiple parties all operating on the same underlying protocol is how it needs to operate.  That's how the internet works.  There is no single implementation of a web server or a single implementation of TCP/IP stack or web browser, etc.  It doesn't make sense to have a single implementation of Bitcoin either, for the simple fact that it's unenforceable.  Someone will absolutely write their own implementation from scratch that does everything the protocol demands and this is a GOOD THING for robustness.  The protocol needs to be able to handle poorly written or even malicious node software.
@_date: 2017-02-16 04:26:09
None of what you just said is true though, you are lying.
I like both Bitcoin and Ethereum. 
You claim ethereum breaks consensus regularly and that there are multiple forks.  In my experience Ethereum has had one fork, due to a glitch that was fixed that allowed the DAO exploit to occur, rolling back the glitch was a good move.  As for regular hard forking, that is part of the design and it's expected.  It's even coded into the protocol to have a fork to switch from PoW to PoS:  The difficulty bomb.  Which basically forces a fork because the difficulty is designed to go exponential so that PoS can catch on.  This is by design and will go off soon.
Secondly, the other fork is fine.  It's a separate network.  It can do it's own thing without affecting Ethereum.   It's probably going to stall and die, but it isn't really Ethereum, it's just a fork of the codebase and they really should change them name to something other than ETC, but whatever.
Consensus only broke once due to a DoS attack that was bogging down the "official" geth nodes.  (geth is Ethereum nodes written in the Go programming language)  fortunately there is another protocol compatible implementation called Parity that was written in the programming language Rust that was immune to the memory exploit that was causing the geth client to fail to sync.  So while the network was slowed it didn't crash.  The alternative implementation actually kept the network running smooth while the "official" geth client was updated.  That's pretty neat to not have a homogonous network, it was immune to an attack because some nodes could function while others failed.  That is the very definition of anti-fragile.
You're cliaim that Ethereum isn't used for anything is a lie.  Ethereum is used for all kinds of innovative stuff:  Onchain blackjack is pretty cool. As is onchain asteroids where you can play games of skill for eth.  These are innovative and creative use cases.  It has a browser plugin called MetaMask that lets you visit ethereum sites in your chrome browser and participate in all sorts of cool dApps.  Have you even looked?
Ethereum is not even v1.0 yet.  It's only been around less than 2 years and it's already got a $1bil market cap.  It's doing really amazing and innovative things.  I think Bitcoin is also awesome and i think the world is big enough for both to succeed.  The claims you made about Ethereum are simply lies.
@_date: 2017-02-15 17:53:32
Nah, I don't agree.  Ethereum manages to have multiple implementations in multiple languages and completely different codebases and the consensus system works just fine.

In a free society we have no government and everyone just does whatever they want all the time without any consequences.  Might makes right because there is no government, just powerful gangs... that enforce order through violence... and become the government -- oh wait... 
so long as there is the ability to use violence or the threat of violence as a tool to force others to do what you want there will always be government.  We grant government a monopoly on violence because they are SUPPOSED to work for us and make the playing field level.  However, human nature is corruptable.  Perhaps with a truly benign AI and robots we could have a utopian non-government... but what hellscape is that where the monopoly of violence is handed over to a non-feeling machine?

you can't expect society to switch units often, preferably never.  That's just bad usability.  If we are going to switch we should switch ONCE and that's it.  Adoption is already slow, making it more confusing by switching unit notation on the masses is going to harm adoption further.
@_date: 2017-02-21 17:22:27
Well, consider the Wild West... outlaws rob and pillage.  Consider areas where government has collapsed, gangs take over.  The largest extreme example of this is USSR collapsing and the Russian Mafia took over the government.
You can't ask nice for people to pretty please not use violence.  People who seek to subjigate others will use violence to achieve that goal.  Defense is either then left up to the individual or to ban together to protect themselves.  If we ban together into collective small groups then we can only protect small interests.  It leads to destabalized regions and a mad-max style of power struggle.  It only takes one bad apple to seek out to conquest their neighbor.   Not all people are rational or empathic.  Some people are just fucking cruel and nuts.  How do we protect against a despot rising to power in one of these gangs and seeking out to destroy his neighbors?
Answer:  We grant a monopoly on violence to the state and the state protects the interests of the common law.  The problem is when the government becomes corrupt.  I think the solution is a constitutional amendment that corruption is punishable by death.

OK, do you actually own the keys to your bitcoin?  Do you have them in your physical possession on a hardware or paper wallet or airgapped computer?  Because if you don't have that then you don't actually own the bitcoins.  If they are on an exchange then you have an IOU which is basically worth $0.00
Secondly, how much money do you have in your bank account?  Because right now you just told the whole world you have $10,000 worth of bitcoins so clearly you don't mind telling the whole world how much bitcoin you have, so it certainly makes sense then that you have no problem telling the whole world exactly how much money you have in your bank account, right?

First of all, I don't think that the success of Ethereum means the demise of Bitcoin so I do not fear the success of alternative projects.  I think the two will co-exist perfectly well and feed into each other since this is a brand new area of computer science research there is room to explore alternative ideas.  That's a good thing.


It can be done with Bitcoin, sure... but Ethereum has better confirmation times and it has the [MetaMask]( browser plugin for Chrome that makes implementation easier for developers.  Also, ETH is worth $12 and rising, not $0 as you seem to think.


I'm 40 quoting 30 years of history, that I lived through and contributed to as I have 25 yrs of programming experience and started coding at 12, professionally at 15 and rode the dot com bubble.  Thanks for asking.


From the documentation that you apparently refuse to educate yourself on because you are so convinced that only your way is the right way:
"Blockjack is a fully decentralized app, there is no server other than the Ethereum network. Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) is hosted on Gitlab Pages, and the  domain just points to it.
This means the game is censorship free, you could get the frontend from wherever it is hosted (HTTP, IPFS, Swarm or a freaking DVD) and connect it to your Ethereum node of choice.
If you are really hardcore, you could even play the game without the frontend, sending the instructions from your wallet or you could create a script to interact with the game directly without human intervention, imagination is the limit."

i don't care what you call them.  i care that we have the unit of notation of 1 million divisions per Bitcoin as standard.  I think the phrase "bit" is perfectly fine and seems to have a lot of momentum behind it, the ambiguities between "bit" in tech parlance is inconvenient but not a show stopper for me.  I'm not attached to the phrase "bit" if there is a better label i'm fine for it.  If we wind up calling them xyz's I don't care.  But it does need to meet certain criteria:  It has to have one syllable to pronounce.  People don't say Dollars, they say Bucks.  They don't say Ten Thousand Dollars.  They say 10 grand or 10 g's or 10k.  Similarly whatever the basic unit of Bitcoin winds up being called it needs to be a single syllable, it needs to represent 1/1,000,000 of value of a Bitcoin and it needs to be easy to remember and write.

Copied directly from the reply directly below the link you posted:
voisine commented on Oct 31, 2015
"Let me ask you a few questions. Your answers to these should help each of us understand the other's point of view.
Do you think that full bitcoins will be a usable denomination in the future when bitcoin becomes a major global currency?
Obviously we feel that it will not be, so given that, is it better for everyone to switch to a more usable denomination today, or wait for the number of bitcoin users to grow first and then switch?
Do you think today that dealing with an mount like .03465 is easier or 34,650? If the latter, wouldn't it make more sense to encourage the person making a request denominated in bitcoins to switch to more user friendly bits?
It's important for the whole community to switch together to the new standard, which is why we don't offer the option to change it. We recognize that it's inconvenient when many others haven't switched, which only demonstrates how important it is to have a single standard used by everyone. It will only get more difficult as the community grows if we don't switch now.
I believe you are in error about bits not being a SI unit. They are equivalent to micro-bitcoins. We use the unicode lowercase stroke b character to represent this in the app, and "bits" seems to be the term that has the most traction in the community, but if people start calling them "micro-bitcoins", we're more than happy to do the same. They also have exactly two decimal places themselves, which matches nearly every other currency in use across the planet, perfect for bringing bitcoin to every person who uses money (many people who use money do not and will never understand arbitrary precision decimals). Also bits will continue to be perfectly usable even when bitcoin has replaced every other currency on the planet, so we'll never need to switch again."

because money is not a metric system.
money already has units of division.  Value and Subvalue to two points of precision.  xxxxxxx.yy  that's how all money looks everywhere in the world.  it doesn't matter if you are talking about USD or EUR or CNY or anything else it's always the same pattern:  xxxxxx.yy TWO points of precision.  So to adopt to the EXISTING system that already exists globally in everyone's mind and to reduce adoption friction we should embrace the concept of adapting to EXISTING financial accounting systems and existing mental bias about what money looks like when written down.   We don't need a bunch of different metric units.  We don't have uDollars and mDollars.  That's just weird.

"It's a method of transmitting money. It's a very effective way of transmitting money and you can do it anonymously and all that. A check is a way of transmitting money, too. Are checks worth a whole lot of money just because they can transmit money? Are money orders? You can transmit money by money orders. People do it. I hope bitcoin becomes a better way of doing it, but you can replicate it a bunch of different ways and it will be. The idea that it has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke in my view."

I don't think there is a way to make paper bitcoin functional without some embedded circuitry of some kind.  Ideally you'd want to be able to wave an RFID reader over your "cash" and have the bills light up if they have a valid balance on them.  Physical cash works because it's easy to handle and quick to pass around.  Cred sticks are cumbersome because they require a computer to verify.  If you could find a way to make paper wallets that were ALSO foolproof against tampering and clearly somehow defaced when priv key is revealed that would solve half the problem.  The other half would be verifying that there is in fact a balance on them to begin with. We need better materials IMO.  Cred sticks are a nice middle option for now.

They are talking about crashing it with a 51% attack, not eliminating it technologically or legally but by basically crashing the network and making the tokens worthless.
It would be expensive though.  If any nation could do it right now it would be China because they have all the mining gear there.  However,  it's in China's best interest to keep BTC alive because it provides a check against the US Dollar.
I would expect eventaully national interests will actually SUPPORT the BTC network.  Many nations providing compute power as well as some well funded non-nation actors each ensuring the other plays honestly.

due to the nature of bitcoin the value is stored on the cloud, not the note.  So you can't trust the note to have any value on it unless you can easily scan it with an online device.  Since that is cumbersome the correct solution is a cred stick.

the bitcoin technically doesn't MOVE anywhere.. if the transaction isn't confirmed then the balance on your address is not updated.  It's not like there was actual bitcoin tokens that got moved from point A to B but then had to be refunded back to you like physical coins do.  It's just an entry in a database.  If the transaction fails it simply never updates and so the prior balance on your address remains unaltered.
@_date: 2017-01-09 06:21:08
yes we are talking about notation.  How tokens are represented to the end user in a standardized way:  BTC vs mBTC vs bits.

When you sell the bitcoin for fiat how does that fiat get into your visa card quickly?  The sale would have had to happen on an exchange of some sort and then the fiat would need to be moved off the exchange into the visa account somehow.

Also, would really suck if your PC went offline while you were shopping.

No, that's not a good situation.  That would make transactions dangerously expensive and cause the network to stall.  Transaction costs still need to remain reasonable which is why $1 can never equal 1 satoshi.
$0.01 = 1 satoshi is absolute max imo.
@_date: 2018-06-08 06:39:11
what data are you basing you assumptions on?
@_date: 2018-06-30 04:24:08
yes, that is totally reasonable.  Bitcoin only became popular in the last 2 years.  The 8 years prior to that it was laughed at and mostly ignored by most people.  Only a small group of people who kept working on the fundamental base layer.  We are only just now seeing second layer solutions emerge.
Analogy:  Internet, the original base layers were TCP/IP and that took 20 years in R&amp;D at universities to figure out networking stacks from 1960s to 1980s.  It was only in the late 1990s that the internet really took off but it took DECADES of research before the foundational layers were built.  Then HTTP came along and merged all the different systems together, but don't forget that HTTP is a layer ON TOP of all the work that came before it.  Bitcoin, similarly, is a base layer for the movement of value over a trustless system.    It has a lot of primitives and op codes.  Many systems still being worked to run on top of it. We don't yet know what the killer app is going to be that binds it into mainstream adoption.

You can buy them on Amazon too.
It's not really a crime to own them and if it ever became a crime to own them they would also have to outlaw Microcontrollers and Secure Elements (the chip in your credit card).
You can always "oops i lost it"
I don't think the hammer is going to be coming after people who own hardware wallets.  But if it ever reaches that point you can be safe in knowing that for it to have gotten to that point then Bitcoin is astronomically valuable and you are a bazzillionair and you can easily pay to leave the country and bribe whoever the fuck gets in your way.

@_date: 2018-06-08 06:41:39
the only reason you can't use it for buying sandwiches and other goods with a stable exchange rate of say 500 satoshis for a sandwich is that it's not widely accepted.  If it was universally accepted then there would be no volatility as it would be the basic currency and unit of exchange.
@_date: 2016-12-30 03:42:26
No they don't.  They simply move the remaining balance to a new address after transaction.  If you wish to send 0.5 bitcoins to someone and you have an HD wallet with three addresses with varying balances: 0.3, 1.0, and 2.5 it will put either the 1.0 or the 2.5 address into the transaction and send 0.5 to the recipient and move the remainder of that address to a new address (minus fees).  But it doesn't stop the recipient from knowing you have either 1.0 or 2.5 bitcoins depending on which address the HD wallet selected.   Sure it doesn't show ALL your bitcoins, but it does leak balance information that it shouldn't.  When I pay with cash or cc the merchant doesn't know how much money I have in my wallet and this is a good thing because it protects me against getting robbed or targeted.  If i buy a sandwich for bitcoin and my HD wallet selects an address that has 2 BTC on it as the source of the funding for the $5.75 sandwich then it's entirely possible that the merchant may decide to jump me in the ally knowing I have almost $2,000 (today's market value of BTC almost $1k) in my HD wallet, possibly even more.

i'm extrapolating the current taxation idea that buying a cup of coffee can trigger a capital gains tax if the btc used to buy the coffee was purchased at $1,000/BTC but then when the coffee was purchased the BTC was worth $2,000/BTC.   If that is the case (which is stupid btw).  Then when AI agents and self operating autonomous organizations are operating at 100,000 transactions per second they will be getting crazy income taxes and loses and all that needs to be reported?   The paper trail will be thousands of miles long.  It's just stupid.  Bitcoin should be treated as money not property and not subject to capital gains tax.

windows has a lot of zero day exploits. So do macs.  Only chromebooks have hardware checks on boot and the system will re-initialize and download itself from google's servers if it has been tampered with.  I don't think that windows is the best option.   Chromebook is.   Paranoia makes sense when dealing with money.  Malware authors are VERY good at what they do.  They have an infinite timeline and the potential to slurp up up everyone's crypto if they write a good virus.  Fuck ya i'm paranoid.  You should be too.

No, that's simply not true.  Imagine this:
Your system has been compromised with a stealthy virus that lays dormant.  It watches your browser looking for crypto addresses.
When it sees you navigate to your favorite exchange and click "deposit" and the exchange gives you a deposit address -- except wait!  The virus sees this and rewrites your web page without your knowledge interjecting the virus author's destination address instead.  You don't know this happened, because the virus is stealthy and silent and doesn't disturb your normal operations in any way.  You think everything is normal, you copy that address off the web site and paste it into your ledger software.  You verify that the address on the device matches the virus generated address on your browser screen.  All looks good, you hit send!  
You go about your business, get a cup of coffee, and suddenly somethings not right... why doesn't the balance show up at your exchange?  Where did your crypto go?  You check the transaction log.  You look at the blockchain.  Yup, the transaction went through... but... the exchange says they don't show a balance.  You blame the exchange.  The exchange never received the funds because the address they generated is not the address you saw!  Your system is compromised but you have no idea!  
To make this virus extra evil it would only activate about 2% of the time so that it remains undetected longer.  You wouldn't understand what was wrong, you would try again.  It would work... weird glitch you would think and you would be bitter but life would move on... until next time it strikes, this time the value is MUCH higher because you have confidence and you think you are safe.
This weak link in the hardware wallet design is the HOST OS.  If it is infected it can show you false addresses!  Nothing ledger can do can protect you against feeding it a bad address.

I don't think tokens that don't have their own network will succeed. Most ERC20 tokens will probably fail as there is no need for a secondary token when you can just use ETH, especially considering that it costs ETH to move an ERC20 token.
That's why I like bitcoin, it's fast, reliable and the underlying tech works and is being innovated.  If you need additional capabilities you build it ON TOP of the network.  Layered approach works best IMO.
But I wouldn't rule out ETH, i think it's a large enough space that we will see innovation on all fruits.
Plus, don't underestimate the Chinese.  NEO looks fascinating.
As does ADA and IOTA (which are not Chinese but poses a unique design)
As for the privacy centric coins I think in the short term they have potential to gain market share and use cases in the black market, however as Bitcoin matures I think privacy will be added as a second layer that works as well as XMR but doesn't require you to run your own wallet node.

we have this today: corporations are "machines" without a soul yet recognized as "persons."  They have vastly more wealth than any individual and yet they don't have the things that make a person human.  The feels.
It's the feels that make the money the point of the game.  With the money gives us the ability to make reality to our feels.  We can attract a mate, build a family, take a vacation, get good food, generally better our lives.  That's the point of money.  Machines, corporations, AI, robots, whatever.  They have no need for money to better their lives because they are not driven by feels.  They simply view money as a tool to accomplish the goal and if the goal is to simply get more money they will accomplish it, probably to the determent of the environment and humanity, but they have no need for money.  If it gets to that point it would be a good idea for humans to simply refuse to participate in that economic model and build a new one.

president should be selected by random lottery.  All citizens ages 18-55 manditory in the pool.  A winner is selected at random via provable hash function.  "Victor" must run the country for 4 years.  Experience doesn't matter, qualification doesn't matter.  What would that look like?
Some would say chaos, and surely there would be moments of madness.  But also, I bet there would be some amazing good that's done when some poor black woman from the ghetto is suddenly elected president.  Some 18 year old girl, or a 55 year old army vet.  Or a 40 year old guy that still lives with his mom, or his mom.  Or a deadbeat's wife.
All sorts of strange stuff would happen.  People of walmart become president.  LOL!

what if you have a billion machines each open a channel to you.  you have one channel they each have one channel but you have collectively one billion channels pouring into you.  then each of those machines sends 0.1 SAT.  Thats 0.1 x 1,000,000,000 = 100,000,000 = 1 BTC, at today's rate is over $8,000.  But you would never be able to collect it because when you close your channel those machines that sent you 0.1 SAT will be truncated to 0 so the result is you will get 0.  Am I missing something?

it's not an issue to lose $0.01 but... you are not thinking like a machine.  Multiple $0.01 x 1,000,000,000 aka the number of transactions machine to machine payments will be doing per minute, if not faster.  Shit adds up.

bitcoin stops working if the private keys can be compromised.  The economic incentive to use the system is a huge component of "bitcoin working"  people will not be interested in it if it can't securely hold value for long periods of time.  So I totally disagree with you that "bitcoin will still work"  in the event of a quantum attack that causes wallets to be stolen from then people will not consider that working.  They will consider that a bug and bitcoin broken.  A fork will not protect people because not everyone will be paying attention and they won't understand what they are supposed to do to migrate their funds to a new quantum safe address.  
tldr; The private keys are derived from elliptical curves.  Quantum computers break elliptical curves.  All your keys are belong to us.  hardfork doesn't protect balances on pre-quantum-safe addresses, i.e. everything in use right now.

bits are easy nomenclature and they came from the idea that there is a million bits in a bitcoin.  it's actually really simple for non tech people to understand.
Lightning wallets should have a toggle to display in whatever unit you want but keep in mind that if you want MASS adoption you have to use what people already understand.  They already are starting to understand BTC.  Changing that is going to be dangerous and make people think that SATs are a new type of crypto.
@_date: 2018-04-23 03:59:30
i still don't get it.  if you have 1B unique addresses each send you 0.1SAT then you close your LN balance with 1BTC on it how does it resolve THEIR end of the transaction?  Each of those 1B LN addresses will have to be truncated to 0 SAT, which means I shouldn't be able to collect anything.
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:52:42
not following you.  an imaginary scenario of the future would be machine-2-machine payments each machine paying to your machine in a swarm of sub-satoshi transactions.  easily a billion channels each with a sub-satoshi balance on the channel.   how does that work if the channels, when closed, result in 0?

what i'm saying is that there are a lot of people just coming to this thread who are just finding out about this. and regardless if "ignorance is no defense" it's also an impractical argument as it basically just encourages people to hide and try to avoid the headache.  What's the path for people who didn't know that they had to pay on crypto-to-crypto transactions and have no record of them because tools like ShapeShift don't keep a record for them.  How do those people come into compliance in a way that is actually doable?

He doesn't need your wallets.  You need him.  So it's his rules or you can take your locked wallet elsewhere.
Additionally, think of his gambit:
He can build good reputation, establish a legit business, pay taxes like a normal person and have a clean and easy life where basically his custom scripts do 90% of his work and he just collects free money.
He can steal a few BTC from some people and get a lot of people pissed at him, the law after him, lawsuits, tax evasion from hiding illegal gains and basically be miserable.
Geee.... tough decision.

Tax liability only occurs when you sell for fiat.  It's really a good idea to have a record of when you purchased and for how much since if  you decide that you don't want to spend the rest of your life hiding your money from the IRS you would need some sort of way to show when you bought them or else you are going to have a really hard time proving they are not short term capital gains.  Long term capital gains are much much less.  However, I don't like coinbase just because their site is slow under load.  I prefer Gemini, it's faster and just works better IMO.
