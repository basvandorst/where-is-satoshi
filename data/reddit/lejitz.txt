Hell yes the government needs to be involved.  If Bitfinex can negligently allow $70mm to be stolen from them, allocate to customers, then run status quo, there is very little disincentive for the behavior.  This needs to be very painful for them.
Unfortunately, it will likely be even more painful for the customer than had they just taken their 36% haircut.  But in the long run, government intervention is far better;  It signals to the exchanges that they are being watched, so behave.

On average, businesses going through bankruptcy are not exchanges with liquid assets.  Usually, illiquid assets are placed in fire sales.  This type of bankruptcy would be relatively easy.  Still... It's not going to be just a 36% haircut.

The comment was written for someone with a somewhat higher ability to assemble logical chains of inferences.  I'm sorry you cannot make sense of it.  I doubt a monkey could make sense of metaphor.  Likewise, I'm not surprised that Gavin cannot make sense of "thousands of lines of code."
Where understanding is concerned, with more complex matters, some just have to get left behind.  While that's a problem, I would not consider it an urgent one--to do so would reduce the word to superfluity.  There's plenty of time to get you up to speed later (or not); if you don't understand now, it's not like the sky is falling or something.

The video is long, so not too many people will watch it.  But this video will leave any academic with the impression that Adam Back and the Blockstream team have the firmest grasp on the challenges, solutions, and best practices related to Bitcoin and blockchain technology development.  They are developing an entire academic field of study around Blockchain technology.  They are categorizing and distinguishing nuances and documenting their relative pros and cons.  **For any company looking to outsource Blockchain needs, Blockstream is clearly the go-to.**  They are becoming both the ideas men and the implementation team.  They are truly an impressive collection of talent.  And it seems they spare no expense in recruiting the best talent.  Bitcoin lovers are lucky--and should be thankful--to have this talented group organized in such a manner that Blockstream's financial interests are best served by serving the best interests of Bitcoin.
The Blockstream guys need Bitcoin to be the best it can be (in order to create a demand for their expertise).  Accordingly, they have figured out (well in advance of everyone else) how to satisfy everyone's desire for scale without sacrificing everyone's desire for trustlessness while also creating a path for fungibility and privacy.  AND they've raised the funds to pay developers for the code to implement these fantastic ideas.  By doing this, they make Bitcoin awesome.  And because they are the ones making Bitcoin awesome, they will be the most natural go-to experts for big companies wishing to interact with Bitcoin because Bitcoin is so awesome; this is how they expect to achieve ROI.  Brilliant!

100% agree, which is why I asked for names.  There are only a few people who have had enough clout to mount the recent political attacks we've faced.  People with this in mind will likely not be able to keep/attain the clout necessary to attack.  Having names named could help in this regard.
As far as retribution is concerned, it's good if there is time, but yes, it's usually only "productive" for deterrence.
Regardless, thank you for all this.

You're under the misconception that as long as you can continue to argue, you can never lose the argument.  But when it comes to debates over matters decided by people, winning is done by persuading--whether a person concedes is of little significance in persuasion.  In fact, in cases like yours, it often helps your opponent (in persuasion) when you refuse to concede; the audience hates that because it shows your insincerity.
You foolishly think you are serving your purpose by endlessly asserting petty arguments.  All this does is serve your ego, which would suffer if you admitted you've been entirely wrong.  Any ordinary reader can identify the motive behind your behavior; they are not confused or persuaded when you demand the definition of "dead."  They know all that matters is that Classic seems to pose no real threat, which they are thoroughly persuaded is true.  Accordingly, when they see you trying to argue over the meaning of "dead," it only strengthens the notion that Classic is certainly not a threat--that people agree Classic was a bad idea.
It's funny to me to watch you do this.  This game is about persuasion.  Without telling you, for months I have occasionally argued with you (and often with people like you) just to use your petty tactics against you.  While you are acting cute with petty ego-protecting arguments, I am scoring huge points in the game of persuasion.  I care very little whether you admit you are wrong, I care about showing others you are.  I, and others like me, have been wildly successful in this endeavor; we owe part of that success to your foolishness.
Notwithstanding the above, I am still very impressed that you are actively posting here even though English is not your native tongue.  In the past year your English has improved dramatically.

You've gone too far with conjecture.  What can be known from this is that MIT is not funding (in case you'd like to correct your facts).  What isn't known is who all is funding, how much, who gets paid what, and what sort of strings are attached to any particular donation.  Additionally, it's not known what other funding sources any developer has.
Regardless, I suspect everything is probably on the up and up, but Gavin is still just some Princeton grad who stumbled into an important position that quickly outgrew him.  His former title carries more weight than his abilities merit.  The nut-hugging accolades he used to receive went to his head in a way that makes it too painful for him to acknowledge that he is now out of his league (self-proclaimed "Chief Scientist").  So in order to avoid this nasty realization, he is fighting tooth-and-nail to maintain appearances (for himself as much as anyone).  However, the realization is creeping in regardless, so he is becoming even more petty.

He is not a super tech guy.  Neither am I or most people very familiar with Bitcoin.  But we know you shouldn't do this.  We know that a decent wallet won't let you do this (it's very common knowledge among Bitcoin enthusiasts).  Roger Ver owns Bitcoin.com and part of Blockchain.info (whose shitty wallet allowed this).  He owned the first Bitcoin store.  He owns a Bitcoin-themed meta subreddit focused on this Subreddit.  When Mt. Gox was collapsing, he partnered with Mark Karpeles to assure everyone that it was not.  He propagated the term "Bitcoin Jesus" to describe himself.  **He knows that if he tries to spend from an unconfirmed zero-fee transaction that it will likely go unconfirmed for a long time.**  That's why he did it.  That allows him to complain about the network in order to deceptively push his political agenda.  He hoped that no one would figure out what he was doing and simply take the image as evidence of a delay from backlog and therefore conclude that we need to switch to his desired development team.  Within the month he's been a party to meetings with Chinese mining pool owners to try to push this agenda, and this trick is simply another effort.
Everyone knows that if a new/casual user uses a shitty wallet they could make this mistake in earnest.  But **Bitcoin Jesus knew better.**

You look like a damn fool for trying to argue that blocks which are presently being produced at up to 2 MB are somehow not 2 MB.  Block Size =+/- transaction data + witness data.  That does not change with Segwit.  Under Segwit blocks will be--are--greater than 1MB.

One of the most convenient ways to make a point is to fabricate "facts" that support you position.
Satoshi's last post was in Dec. of 2010.  That was the month of Peter Todd's and Pieter Wuille's registration.  Luke-Jr and gmaxwell registered their Bitcointalk accounts in 2011.  Virtually all of the "key developers" we have today were never even a blip on Satoshi's radar.  The tiny group that was on his radar are no longer "key"--they can't keep up.
@_date: 2016-04-02 14:16:01
Let me take a crack at putting this in layman terms (my language).  Developers please correct me if I'm way off-base.
People have been selling Bitcoin as "programmable money" for years.  In reality, though, to program meaningful applications would be too costly in block space (if possible at all).  Merkelizing makes complex programming function possible with no block space cost.  Segwit makes it all practicable.  Accordingly, with MAST via Segwit, Bitcoin's contractual functionality can be greatly enhanced.  As an added bonus, merklizing can keep many contractual conditions private while still verifiable through public measures.
Segwit is sold as a fix to malleability and a throughput increase (both true and very important).  But you may have also heard that developers are more excited by the "scripting" functionality Segwit adds.  This is part of that.  Developers realize that this type functionality allows for utilitizations that they have not begun dreaming-up yet.
In essence, it's like creating a programming language (or adding programmability where it did not prior exist).  Developers are excited because the design opportunities are endless even though they have not yet began designing.

Fantastic Article.  That no Classic supporter has even mentioned this trip is quite telling.  The meeting must have really entailed nothing encouraging for them to take away.  Accordingly, they decided not to mention it in hopes no one would hear about it.
This explains why Gavin has suddenly started making pull requests for Core again; why Armstrong has dropped the subject and started tweeting instead about virtual reality; and why Garzik has begun touting sidechains and the lightning network (kindof) as a scaling solution and hanging out on Core's slack.  They hoped they could let this slide and quietly earn their way back into good graces.

**This Segwit block consumes 2MB of drive space.**
If this block were produced under Classic (i.e., the exact same transactions), it would also consume 2MB.
**SegWit increases block size.**  Block size = transaction data + witness data.  That is true now and it is true with Segwit.  Using Segwit, Max Block Size is greater than 1 MB.
This increase is even in the code.  [MAX_BLOCK_SIZE = 1000000]( has been changed to [MAX_BLOCK_SERLIALIZED_SIZE = 4000000](
Segwit is a lot of things--all positive.  One of these is a max block size increase.

Glad you're on board.  Segwit is nothing but positive.  But I can point to at least 10 highly upvoted posts from very regular contributors over there that expresses the opposite sentiment.  They are pissed.  The comments from the multiple other users reflect much of the same angry attitude.
At this point, many are irate.  The reason: it's becoming clear they've been on the wrong side of this.  In believing liars, they've been falsely accusing Core developers of all sorts of conspiracies.  The fight causes people to question which side is telling the truth.  It's becoming too apparent now that it is Core supporters.  Their embarrassment is both humiliating and infuriating.

I thought the federal conviction was a strong public impeachment of his character.  If the conviction alone isn't enough, the publicly available transcript of his sentencing hearing should definitely persuade a reasonable person that he's a liar (the judge was way too smart for his shenanigans).  There's the whole the-government-was-out-to-get-me story to explain the conviction.  Then there's the Mt. Gox. bullshit.
But somehow deceptively trying to spend from a zero-fee unconfirmed transaction is the thing that hits home.  Ver is the worst kind of narcissist, the self-righteous kind.  He always believes he's justified in doing the shittiest things.  That he buys his own bullshit persuades a few fools that he is trustworthy.  Don't be one of them; he is a liar.

Your only explanation is "herp derp go read something and then you'll understand some nonsense."  The fact is the Block Size is larger than 1MB and prior to this conversation you had no idea that even the constant is changed in Segwit.  Yet... Somehow you pretend you have some sort of superior grasp on the subject.  The only thing you have a better grasp on is your metaphorical manhood as you mentally masturbate to the strangely grandiose notion that you are a very smart software developer.

I'm probably not technical enough to understand a publication anyway.  My real questions are therefore two-fold.  In your expert opinion (1) will it work (to decentralize mining), and, if so, (2) can it be feasibly implemented?
@_date: 2016-04-04 18:42:49
The question that pops into mind is this:  does the miner receive a material benefit from having a more connected node?  If not, and if the mining can be done on pruned nodes, then I can see it working (slowly over time).  It's ability and implementation ease need only match stratum.  Under those circumstances, the benefit of the miner feeling that they are helping the network is probably worth the minuscule cost of node running (so long as the miner is not statistically losing rewards).
Looking forward to seeing it.

Brilliant.  Such an elegant solution.  And technically very feasible.  Unfortunately, the difficult problem to solve when hard-forking Bitcoin is not a coding problem, but an economic problem: How do we get the market to immediately value the new forked branch as if it is the real Bitcoin and also devalue the real Bitcoin?
If you don't do this, then the rewards on the new fork are worthless, meaning no one will mine it for more than a few blocks, until switching back to mining the chain that is profitable.  So within minutes of forking, all the forked blocks will be orphaned (longest chain yara yada) with there being no fork even remaining.  Satoshi didn't have this problem.  When he considered, the market cap was meaningless and miners were hobbyists--i.e., the problem was mostly a technical coding problem.  With a $6 Billion market cap, the challenge is far greater than coding.
Of course, you could rely on a checkpoint at every block to circumvent the longest chain rule, but this introduces trust and no longer relies on POW to show the validity of the chain--certainly not part of Satoshi's plan.  That would actually allow human discretion to determine which chain (transactions) is the valid chain, which defeats the entire purpose of the Blockchain.
@_date: 2016-04-30 14:51:25
Haha.  You seriously should read his sentencing hearing transcript.  For grins I pulled it up on pacer a few weeks ago.  The guy was trying the same type tactics with a federal judge in an attempt to preserve an appeal for a compelled guilty plea.  The judge played along but shut down every weasel avenue with surgeon-like precision.  Ver was a liar then and a liar now.
It's weird too.  No reasonable person would think this "rebuttal" would actually persuade the people he is trying to persuade; it pisses them off more that he insults their intelligence with cutesy bullshit.  The only reason he makes it is to have a "plausible" deniability that he was being deceptive.  But it's so transparent that the only person he is fooling is himself.  In fact, the people he wishes to persuade are actually more annoyed by this "rebuttal."  An uninterested person can easily see this.  But Ver cannot.  Ver has worked against his goal (persuasion) in order to maintain his self-image (because he can choose to believe his own deceit while no one else will).  The guy is the epitome of narcissism, the self-righteous/self-destructive type of narcissism.  For a relatively smart guy, he is a true idiot.

And all without even the need for a hard fork.

I literally read the entirety of your post looking for a little laugh from your sarcasm.  But you are serious?
Roger Ver is a bad guy.  He's a self-righteous narcissistic who would rather continue to lie than ever acknowledge wrongdoing and turn from his ways.  Rather than use his time in prison to reflect on how he should change his ways he decided to expatriate and concoct a story about how the government was maliciously out to get him.  Even if you were gullible enough to believe this barely plausible story, his subsequent history should have been enough to remove any "reasonable" doubt; Roger Ver is a bad guy.

Totally agree.  Bitcoin can never scale to buying cups of coffee on-chain.  Lightning, etc. are absolutely essential to this end.
But to compare the two currently competing "solutions," this number is very interesting.  Not only does Segwit pave the way for these off-chain solutions, but it also provides more on-chain throughput than even its non-lightning-enabling competitor can boast.
I personally don't find coffee purchases that important for Bitcoin, but I exuberantly welcome them if there is no/little cost to censor-resistance and immutability.  I find it ironic that the solution best protects immutability and leads to Lightning also provides even better on-chain scaling than its simple-minded "competitor."

First, you said:


Had you read carefully, you would have realized that I have a problem with having a mining pool as your only option, as I said


That pools are few makes them governable (centralized) and bribe targets.  **If users are to be able to maintain, they need to be able to solo-mine (Important premise for point two).**  However, having the option makes it less likely that they will have to exercise it.
Second, you said


That depends...  Mining machines vary in cost.  Once they are purchased, however, the cost is "sunk," therefore the cost should not even be considered in the decision whether to run it or not.  At that point, the primary costs to mining is electricity.  It has usually been a given that miners will have adequate internet.  But if the bandwidth requirements increase for running nodes, this may not be the case.  In fact, as bandwidth requirements increase, it may create a huge incentive to pool in a location that has the best connectivity so that the delays associated with block propagation do not place you at a disadvantage.  If the disadvantage is too great, it can never be profitable to solo mine without very expensive internet connections.  Pooling is centralization.
Third, the most important option that users need is the option to fork an algo change.  If this is done, all current miners are immediately worthless and CPU/GPU mining (very low cost) could become feasible again.  But before this can happen, users need to be capable of running nodes.  Under Gavin's plan (data center nodes), these options are gone entirely.  Under Gavin's plan, Bitcoin is in the hands of government.  He even calls the desire to run nodes a "fetish."  But the ability to run nodes is the last straw to maintaining the decentralization of Bitcoin.  What needs to happen next (if possible, I know some are working on this) is a change that will disincentivize pooling.

There seems to be no longer be a reasonable fear that a contentious hard fork will succeed.  It is the fear over such an event that likely leads to market timidity.  No one is quite certain how the market would respond to such an event.  Accordingly (and ironically), the market therefore remains low.  The whole "markets hate uncertainty" thing.
Now that a contentious hard fork seems unlikely, the market is reflecting a more confident sentiment.
The threat over a hard fork came in the name of increasing the maximum block size within Bitcoin (generally thought to be impossible without broad and simultaneous consensus within the ecosystem).  The block size is currently capped at 1MB.  For technical reasons, we can't safely increase it to more than about 4.  
One group wanted to implement a simple change that increase the block size to 8 MB, growing over 20+ years to 8 gigabytes.  After realizing that this was not safe, they dropped that push and fought for only 2 MB.  The move appeared mostly political at that point, as the current group of developers had already determined a method of effecting the same results with only a soft fork (far safer) that would also provide far more technical benefits.
Still, because the matter is complicated, it was uncertain whether the market would understand the distinctions.  It is now becoming apparent that the market is not interested in the simple 2MB Hard fork.
As a side note, the purported purpose of increasing the block size is to increase the maximum number of possible transactions.  But another solution is in development called the Lightning Network that aims to provide transaction scaling at a far greater magnitude than any block size increase could ever.  Interestingly, the same soft fork solution ("SegWit") that allows for a roughly 2MB block also allows for the implementation of the Lightning Network.
Given these circumstances, it seems that the market is seeing blue skies for Bitcoin's future.
Another factor that is likely weighing in on the market is a reward halvening.  A block is found in Bitcoin roughly every 10 minutes.  And with each block that is "solved," a miner (or mining pool) is rewarded with Bitcoin.  The amount rewarded halves roughly every 4 years.  It started at 50/block.  It is presently at 25 per block.  In July, it is scheduled to drop to 12.5/block.  It is widely believed that miners mostly sell the rewards very quickly.  Accordingly, the halvening of the reward is expected by many to lessen the available supply of Bitcoins on the open market.  They expect lower supply will equate to higher price.  It seems likely that many are accumulating now in hopes of a price spike due to this event.

@_date: 2016-04-13 15:39:33


This was the conclusory vision stated in the white paper:


The motivation could be inferred from the linked article in the genesis block; Satoshi wanted a currency outside the purview of government.  
I'd say the current developers share his ultimate vision more zealously than the ones they have replaced, which is why decentralization is of highest importance to them.
However, while they agree with Satoshi's visionary ends, since his departure, they have discovered means that far-better serve this end--means that were made somewhat possible through functions introduced in Bitcoin's first iteration, 0.1.  While Satoshi envisioned a means of "scaling" transactions, his method comes at a cost to his ultimate vision, supra.  More true to his vision, the current developers have designed a far-superior means of scaling transactions--and at no cost to trustlessness.  We can't know if Satoshi prefers this method.  But I can't see why he wouldn't; it better serves his ultimate end and it better serves transaction scaling.  This is why so many of us support the Core developers, we recognize that their ideas are better than the ones of the early developers--the big fish in the tiny pond.


And that's what the fight in the last year has been about.  There often comes a sense of entitlement with time on the job.  The old developers feel disenfranchised as newer developers begin to garner the respect that the earlier developers feel is rightfully theirs.  Rather than yielding to the better ideas, ambition (and probably avarice) demands they oppose the shift of influence.  In doing this over the course of the last year, most of the earliest guys (Andresen, Garzik, and Hearn) have lost most of the community respect they previously enjoyed.  Now they can no longer compete in the arena of ideas.

There is no *reasonable* justification for a hard fork over a soft fork.

Of course minimally rational is all that is required for someone to make a Hail-Mary attempt at pretending to argue in earnest.

Soft forks are backwards compatible when they activate, meaning un-upgraded users can continue to operate as they have until enforcement is reached.  Hard forks are the ones that leave the users with no option immediately upon activation.  Ironically, even with Core's soft forks they haven't enforced until 95%, but Classic aims to do so at 75%.

e.g. Mr. Chicken Little
"Lead[] Maintainer" is an actual role.  When you step down from it you are at best a developer.  Gavin, however, created a new role, "Chief Scientist," which is not a role at all, but a damn fine, important-sounding, title.
It was so foolish for him to think he could keep the pomp without the circumstances.  But 20 MB was also foolish; BIP101 as well; and Classic too.  Apparently foolishness is in the nature of our "Chief Scientist."
Gavin stumbled into an important position; he became the biggest fish in a very tiny pond.  As the talent flocked to Bitcoin development he was able to pretend to still be the most worthy of the role, because he was lead maintainer--an important and privileged position.  The privileges concomitant with that title afforded him the best seats at the most important meetings.  He thought, however, that it was his attributes that afforded the niceties; while other developers were clear-to-him more capable at developing, those fine seats persuaded Gavin (easily persuaded his ego) that he was still somehow superior.  Accordingly, it seemed natural and fitting that he should proclaim the title, "Chief Scientist."
As it turns out, this was just another in a string of bonehead decisions that exemplify to the sophisticated with Bitcoin that Gavin is not worthy of respect.  It's too bad Satoshi did not have better options for his fledgling project.
**There's no telling where Bitcoin could be without the dark-ages of Gavin.  I suspect privacy would have been implemented and mining centralization would have been greatly curtailed.  But he is too myopic to realize the significance of such things.  He thinks they are "mole-hills" in his face when, in-fact, they are "mountains" in the distance.**

If you spend from an unconfirmed transaction, you must wait for that transaction to confirm before your new transaction will confirm.  There's nothing about that that is broken.
Transactions confirmation priority is based on fees.  That's not broken.
Bitcoin Jesus sends a zero fee transaction to himself (long confirmation), then sends a suggested fee transaction and complains because it's taking a long time to confirm, but **tells no one about the underlying transaction.**  Bitcoin Core wallet won't allow you to do this.  But Ver used a shitty outdated wallet that he is part owner of.  It was his intention to have a long confirmation while making it look as if the confirmation should have been short.  I blame him for this.  I'd blame his shitty wallet if a casual user incidentally experienced this.  But **Bitcoin is fine**--no failure on its part.  But I suspect you know this already and are just perfectly happy being a liar.

That can't happen if is too costly to run nodes.  If it becomes too costly for the average user to run a node, they have to rely on a pool to mine.  Pools are few.  At this point users couldn't even fork an algo change.  Take the nodes and you've made Bitcoin governable.
This is why increasing the block size is so important to some.  Completely different (hidden) agendas.

Nope.  It’s an open network, like Bitcoin.


If node owners colluded to block you in Bitcoin or Monero, you would be SOL.  But they won’t.  Because these operate on open networks, there are thousands of nodes (too many to collude).  That’s the purpose of assuring decentralization through low resource consumption.
Similarly, the on-ramp to the Lightning Network is simply the opening of a payment channel between two uncensorable nodes.  Opening a payment channel with one node gains access to everyone that node has a channel opened with, everyone they have a channel opened with, and so forth.  All the payment channels are networked with payments routed between them from one node (through many) to another anywhere on the internet.  Just like with Bitcoin, there are theoretical fringe cases where censorship *could* exist.  In reality, though, it won’t—just like thousands of node owners won’t collude to block you.

There’s no side chain for the Lightning Network.  Payments are routed through payment channels (intermediaries), but there is no counterparty risk.  Also, there is no need for the channels to be through “major payment nodes.”  Wherever a channel is open, the two parties have access to the other parties that each has a channel open with and so forth.  But nobody ever has their funds at risk.  If ever there is an attempt to alter the balance, a blockchain confirmation (at the option of either party) will set the record straight.  Because of this, there will rarely be a need for a confirmation—channels will usually remain open for extended times.

No.  A channel opened between the two of us will suffice.  Then you will have access to my other channels, their other channels, and so on.  Payments hop through multiple channels to reach the destination.
It’s similar to me pinging your IP address.  The packets might go through 20 routers before it reaches you.  Having internet access may require a large ISP, but once internet connectivity is present, lightning network connectivity will not require a large payment channel provider just like TOR access is readily available and open.

Lol.  If it’s in a bank account you don’t hold it, the bank does.  And if you choose to spend it, the bank does that for you at their will.  Their choice is part of the counterparty risk.
But coins on the Lightning Network (in a payment channel) can be spent without permission.  There is zero counterparty risk. The keyholder does not have to trust anyone to spend their funds how they direct.
Payments are routed through multiple payment channels (multiple hops) until it reaches the destination address.  Your employer pays you through your open payment channel with someone else (you’ll have multiple open channels).  Your employer won’t know or care where your payment channels are opened; it won’t matter.  Similarly, nobody cares who your ISPs are when sending you an email.  Payments reach their destination through a series of hops through interconnected payment channels.  And there should rarely be a need for a confirmation.


First.  Who cares?  Second.  No.  Payment channels were in the first iteration of Bitcoin.  And Satoshi has early brainstorms regarding this type of scaling.

I’m not talking about the counterparty risk that exists in the contract for the sale of goods.  I’m talking about the counterparty risk that exists in the contract for banking and payment services.  In those, your bank/payment processor can refuse to pay balances shown/owed/disputed.  This is usually done under “equitable” concerns (i.e., “We don’t think it’s fair that you have your money.”).
On the other hand, coins dedicated to the Lightning Network can always be claimed in the correct balance by any party with funds committed.  This is done with a simple blockchain confirmation.  And the Court of Confirmation has no equitable concerns.  Accordingly, the Lightning Network is trustless.  It always gives perfect holder-in-due-course status to the party holding the keys to the funds.
Detractors wish to claim that using the Lightning Network is tantamount to trusting a bank.  This simply is not so.  The counterparty risk present in banking is completely absent in the Lightning Network.  Nobody can take your funds and nobody can tell you how you can’t spend your money.

Why are you lying?  Clearly you have read my posts and know I never claimed it was "inevitable," I just told you that and you had the ability to re-read my posts to know you were wrong.  But instead, in trolling fashion, you chose to repeat it anyway.  Of course it's not inevitable, a fee market can be avoided by consensus to hard fork (and to our pleasant surprise it can be delayed with Segwit).  But a consensus requiring hard fork is unlikely and it is well-known to be likely that consensus won't be achieved.  Therefore it's a null point that people should be alerted or else it's "criminal."


Acceptable is a strange choice of words.  Of course I accept (as should anyone else) that you expect that.  Yet it's still a bit unreasonable to expect people to all agree on anything where there are competing interests.  In this case, even if you can get everyone to agree that the cap should increase, then you have to get practically all of them to agree on exactly how, exactly when, etc.  This is what the protocol so valuable--it's practical immutability when it comes to removing restrictions.  People can't lose their value at the whim of a quick acting majority getting rid of rules (they can't just raise the reward either).  But even with this expectation, you are fully aware that without a hard fork, which is highly contentious, fees are likely to rise.  This, you are fully aware of what JG says you need to be alerted to.  Everyone who wants to be is also aware.  NULL!
While you say you agree to disagree, I suspect that you actually painfully agree with me on the points above, but ego forbids you from admitting it.

Haha.  It's a damn good analogy.  So good that your only rebuttal is to say otherwise.
On the one hand you demand solid "proof," but then on the other hand you present a link to tradeblock as an example of such "proof" that we need "headroom."  If you are going to try to win this debate by masking the fact that your side has no merit, you are going to have to do a much better job.  You are transparently devoid of reason, which is why my side is winning by a landslide.  The plan is to implement Segwit which will give some headroom (which we don't urgently need since the only thing that happens is fees increase).  Meanwhile we work on IBLT and LN (among other things).  Then after implementation we re-evaluate.
Every reasonable person understands that this works, no matter how large of a tantrum you guys throw.  Wiser people in your position would have thrown in the towel a long time ago, and certainly after Scaling Hong Kong.

Too much rant for me.
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:31:11
Fair enough.  There's just so much misinformation being spread by people with an ulterior motive.  But we agree; as it stands, Bitcoin cannot scale if every transaction must go through the laborious process of confirmation and broadcast.  LN provides a way to transact without these requirements while allowing for blockchain settlement (aka confirmation) if needed.  It's elegant.
Bitcoin itself has always been a payment network and settlement system combined.  LN is an added payment system with much higher throughput than the original, and only possible because of the underlying original payment network and confirmation system.
@_date: 2015-12-23 15:44:17
I can't see how any objective person could not find this to be far better than clumsily just raising the block size cap.
If every real world transaction must be known and processed by every Bitcoin participant, Bitcoin does not scale.  But as long as participants have the option of settling transactions on chain, then the Blockchain works to keep everyone honest, even though it is only used (with other exceptions of course) when people are being dishonest.
The best analogy I've heard is contract enforcement by the courts.  It only happens a small percentage of the time, but because it can and does happen people tend honor their contracts without judicial directive.  Accordingly, thousands upon thousands of contracts get entered and executed daily without ever even being exposed to the laborious court system.
Integrity of Blockchain transactions requires a lot of work and coordination.  All that effort should not be necessary to purchase some Christmas presents.  And it's not, so long as the parties have the security of knowing they can take the transaction to the chain if things go wrong.
I am totally convinced that the majority of those who are loudly opposed to scaling in this manner are primarily just too butthurt to admit that their initial understandings were wrong; their pride wants to win the fight (which they are losing desperately) notwithstanding the ultimate damage to Bitcoin.  Of course, there are also a few of those who have a business interest that does not align with the ultimate success of Bitcoin; they tend to stir the anger of the former group to hate LN.  Fortunately, most who matter are heading in the right direction regardless of the angry mob.  (Vast majority of the main developers, all the mining pools, 90%+ node operators, 99% hash power).

What needle?  All that happens is fees go up.


They do pose a risk to decentralization and come at a cost to those of us who maintain the chain/network.


Bullshit!  It's practically equivalent in terms of transaction throughput (you need to argue in earnest or else you're a little bitch).


So?  Like two months ago guys like you were saying it will never exist.  Give it a rest.  SW will deploy in February(ish) which will give time for LN and if it's not enough time then fees rise.
You need practical consensus for your ideas, but there is no pressing need.  I'm not persuaded and you need almost all of us.  What's hilarious is that you barely have anyone in agreement who matters.  There is less than 1% hash rate dedicated to the cause.  Less than 10% nodes.  Practically no devs.  Seriously.  It's time to accept reality--Bitcoin will thrive notwithstanding the defeat of tiny inconsequential movement to demand a cap increase.

You are misinformed on such an enormous level.  Lightning network is being developed in at least three different locations, but the one I follow most closely is being developed in the open on GitHub (like Bitcoin).  It is open source and will result in an open protocol (like Bitcoin/SMTP/TOR).  The profit from developing it only will come from sales of expertise for developing other software (for individuals) or from fees generated running a node--but anyone can do this, just like anyone can mine Bitcoin, not just the developers.


Also not true.  In fact, the authors of the white paper have been outspoken that they support a modest increase (like 4 MB) such that it does not too drastically slow block propagation in detriment to the reliability of the blockchain.  The people you probably think are fighting an increase (e.g.  Adam Back, Greg Maxwell) have even supported/drafted specific BIP proposals, but simply reject BIP101.  You need to get your head out of your ass and quit listening to people who lie to you to get their way.


They may not (it may not even be necessary).  But after the "second layer" it will be clearer how much of an increase is truly required (it could be a decrease is desirable).  Also, by this time IBLT may have been successfully implemented to make an increase far less detrimental to the network.  I'll be more willing to hear you out if we reach capacity that causes an adoption-killing fee increase even after we have made the saner optimizations to the protocol and added a routed payment channel solution.  I suspect others will too.  Right now it's not needed, and we can't know what will be needed until after current plans are executed.

Pretty sure this is wrong.  Fincen came out with a ruling a while back that if the coins are held in a foreign exchange within the year you must report it.  I had to for 2013 (in 2014) when I held funds on Gox that I withdrew before collapse.  I was afraid not to comply because had collapsed and I knew the authorities would be alerted (plus I always abide by the law).

No shit!  But for the same reasons that hearsay is not admissible in court, it tends to carry much less weight in the court of public opinion.  This is far less meaningful than if Lee, who is perfectly capable of speaking for his company, says it.  This just seems like a guy who may be taking some words out of context to push his agenda.
There are some of you, a loud few, who will latch on to anything that supports your cause.  However for the rest of the onlookers, the blatant inconsistencies that come with your methods actually persuades them you are wrong.  Then, when they consider your merit, they are fully convinced that your arguments are completely disingenuous.  It's why you have totally lost this battle: no merit and no integrity.  Therefore you achieve support from no miners, no mining pools, few node operators, and fewer developers.

First.  I notice that you don't argue whether his point is null or not, so I assume this is just a sidetrack, because you can't successfully argue otherwise.
But I'll address it nonetheless.


Not true.  As with all areas where heated discourse exists, people become passionately self-involved.  Accordingly their statements become a reflection of their unwavering bias.  They often begin to care more about ego protection than the underlying matter they were advocating for.


Then you need to respect my opinions.  However, while I agree that opinions should be freely stated, many aren't worthy of respect.  And if they are worthy that gets shown through the vetting process of discourse--like I am doing.  So far, his opinion is null (from a biased perspective).


Actually, the best path was already chosen and it wasn't democracy (majority rule) but instead one where removal of protocol restraint requires practical consensus among miners and mass approval amongst node operators.  Accordingly, a small group can hold a veto notwithstanding some agreed method of democracy.  In line with that, and out of "respect" of that vision, I am expressing my supported opinion that his opinion is null.  
You have no direct argument to that, only sidetracking.

FUD (fear uncertainty and doubt).  You know the right answer but don't have time to explain--sure.  You know dick!
The truth is no one is going to explain shit to their users.  They are going to choose to adopt the chain that will accommodate all users--the one that supports larger blocks.  The QT chain won't recognize the larger blocks, but the XT chain will recognize them all.  As soon as it forks, meaning a majority has accepted larger blocks, then users (wallet providers) either switch or get left behind, therefore they will switch, or also get left behind.  If they don't switch, their users will simply migrate to a wallet on the correct chain.  Simple, not scary.  No need for fear.

Conclusion of the article:


**No choice but to use it by that point?**
That's so dramatic and extreme (although still less so than others in his camp).  The only "deprecation" of core features is an opt-in RBF node policy; that can easily be changed back with no hard fork.  The only other things core has done is add features (and RBF is an addition as well).  And core has delayed a block cap increase.  If lightning sucks, everything the other camp is suggesting can still be done.  No one has excluded any options.  However, if BIP 101 were adopted (as OP is a proponent of), that decision could become irreversible as the network begins to become more centralized and the smaller players lose their voice.
Surely everyone is tiring these ridiculously obvious games??

That's a little better, still not great.  But at least there is alliteration and an association to the female gender.  However, it loses its effect when I have to coach you.


You're demonstrating ignorance here, so I'll go ahead and school you up (and anyone else reading).  The most proximate danger from increasing the cap comes from slower block propagation times, which leads to more orphans, higher chance of reorgs, and the possibility of a selfish mining attack that makes finding the next block more likely, then the next, and the next.  These things can result in great harm to Bitcoin and therefore a relatively small cap increase is accordingly "dangerous."  However, IBLT practically removes the need to even propagate blocks and instead requires only the propagation of a list of transactions included in the block (and then node operators assemble the blocks themselves rather than downloading the entire blocks).  Accordingly, the slowing of propagation times becomes relatively null to the decision making increasing the cap "safer."
You need to quit being confident and ignorant at the same time.  In fact, given that you are willing to do this, even once you've been educated it would be best for you to refrain from being confident--you will probably still be drawing unreasonable conclusions.

Target gives a 5% discount for using their red card debit card.  Diesel fuel retailers offer discounts cash over cards.  Why wouldn't an online merchant with high chargebacks costs offer discounts just as high if not higher?  You are looking the merchant who benefits the least from Bitcoin, but I'm concerned with the ones who benefit most--those with high chargebacks and interest payments on inventory float.
Everyone knows it's better to receive cash (if it doesn't get lost or stolen).  Once the retailers described above realize that Bitcoin is like cash but not easily stolen, the incentives should come.

Reeks of ass-talk.


Not persuaded.  I think a fee increase is not a big deal unless it starts to become dramatic.  Meanwhile, I think Segwit will bring us back to less than full blocks (notwithstanding spam attacks) for a while.


Not a big deal.  Just pay a higher fee if you want first block confirmation.  Use RBF if you want to pay absolute minimum fee.
The rest of what you say (regarding number of users) is just unsupported conclusions with inferences built on false premises.
You guys just can't stand the fact that you aren't getting your way.  And regardless of whether your way is the better way or not, you want to get it.  Childish.
Segwit will be implemented soon.  IBLT should be implemented soon enough thereafter to make it more possible to implement a cap increase if necessary,  Maaku expects to be testing alpha implementations of the LN in 2 months.  You guys need to cool it.  **The sky is not falling.**

Wrong again dipshit.  You can perform a hard fork with a minority (see feathercoin which was a hard fork of litecoin).  But if you want it not to be messy (and still be Bitcoin) you need consensus, which is not a difficult term at all.
Consensus 
noun  con·sen·sus \kən-ˈsen(t)-səs\
: a general agreement about something
: an idea or opinion that is shared by all the people in a group
However, if you would like a messy hard fork you can fork with less than consensus, the more dissenters you have, the more messy.  In fact, if you only had a 75% you would like be committing a nuclear option when it comes to value, which would be destroyed through mass exodus.  Thankfully you guys have agreement from practically no one who matters (you have like 2 devs vs. 95% with my side, you have like 10% of nodes, like 0 miners, and one exchange).  If you guys forked off with an altcoin no one would even notice.


We want a LN because it is the solution to the fact that so long as every transaction must be processed by every actor **Bitcoin does not scale.**  Yet you live in a fantasy world where Bitcoin scales "easily and simply" by increasing on-chain transactions.  That's because you are full of shit.  At just a few MB increase block propagation times slow tremendously, destroying the reliability of the network.  Do you even realize how much throughput increase a well-connected node (30 connections +-) must support to maintain the same propagation time?  Do you realize what happens when the propagation time lessens and the network is not synced?  I'm going to assume by your numerous ignorant statements that you don't.  You talk out of your ass and think you have good breath.  You're a hopeless fool.  So while you proclaim simplistic ease, the reality is otherwise.  But a LN could solve the problem, because it rids of the actual problem; it provides a trustless and safe method for processing multiple transactions without requiring all actors to be aware and without requiring the hard work of confirmation unless there is a disagreement.  That's why people want it you nincompoop.


No.  I think you are mostly a bunch of simple-minded idiots who are incapable of vision with a mixture of I-don't-give-a-fuck-cuz-I-think-this-will-make-me-rich-faster.


Of course I've considered this.  But conflicts of interest are routinely present in most of life's dealings.  All agents have self interests that must be set aside for their fiduciaries.  And conflicts are not inherently wrong so long as they are disclosed.  And once disclosed (as they are here), people must give a watchful eye to those who have the conflict.  Having done that I am persuaded that Blockstream is simply doing what is best Bitcoin, which also happens to be best for their company.  LN--an open source open project on github--is not going to profit Blockstream anymore than anyone else wishing to run a node (very little).  But Blockstream will, as many engineering firms, profit from selling the expertise and name recognition derived from developing LN and perfecting Bitcoin.  I am persuaded this is their business model.  Those smart fuckers realized what is best for Bitcoin and realized how to profit from being the experts who implement what is best; I applaud them.  Of course, I (having a large position in Bitcoin) remain very watchful to make sure that I find their desires to be in the best interest of Bitcoin.  But I am in total agreement that the best way to scale is through a LN and that relatively small/unnecessary cap increases could be quite detrimental to Bitcoin.  Accordingly I don't think their potential for a conflict is causing them to act against the better interest of Bitcoin.  In fact, it appears that their interests are actually aligned with the long-term best interests of Bitcoin.  Their plans seem best.
On the other hand, I think your side may be greatly motivated by the quickest way to get rich, giving little shits about the long-term viability of the protocol (leave that for the greater fools??).  However, I suspect you are mostly motivated by stupidity.
You really need to educate yourself.  You listen to and repeat a bunch of morons.

Shameless FUD.  To anyone scared by this, recognize that if Gavin kicked off all other developers from core there is nothing to stop a fork into Core 2, as is done with XT.  Accordingly, the client ran becomes simply a market choice.  This does not give the appearance of centralization over Bitcoin, but only over one iteration of potentially unlimited iterations.  As easily as you understand this, so do regulators; it is not complicated.  
If regulators did not already understand this, then the handful of current devs would have already been shut down like liberty reserve.  The number of devs (2 devs vs 20 vs 100) is not what stops regulators from shutting it down; they are prevented by the fact that shutting down repositories will do nothing to shut down Bitcoin.
If Gavin kicked everyone out, it might be a bad political move (which is surely why he has not), but it does nothing to change the decentralized nature of Bitcoin.  In fact, the disgruntled devs would certainly create a competing version, declaring their's the legitimate.  Moreover, there could even be splits among them where even different versions would come forth.  Undoubtedly, within days of a move like this Bitcoin would actually appear even more decentralized based on Todd's rationale.  Notwithstanding appearance, Bitcoin will remain completely decentralized no matter what the developers do.  The users choose which code to run.  Gavin is safe from the law no matter whom he revokes commit access for.

No shit Sherlock!  None of it is urgent, which is why we have time to wait for a solution (or at least part of a solution) that does not come at a cost.


Holy fucking shit!  You don't know what a hard fork is and yet you still argue confidently ignorant.  A hard fork is one that requires consensus in order to implement all at once network-wide (usually because it is removing a limitation within the protocol rather than adding one which can be "soft" forked in).  It is not because it is difficult to implement that makes it hard, but because there is an immediate and abrupt "hard" fork in the chain where in the next block all participants must either run the new code or be rejected from the network.  Soft forks can allow for a time when noncompliant nodes/blocks can operate alongside compliant nodes/blocks and usually become "enforced" after enough time has passed for the vast majority of operators /miners to become compliant.  They are not immediate or abrupt and there is a time when multiple versions are operating simultaneously (i.e. Soft).


So does Segwit.  It operates like a cap increase to 1.6 to 2.0 MB while also alleviating malleability and allowing for easier upgrade implementations in the future.  So why the hell are you throwing a tantrum for more, knowing that it comes at a "cost"?  (I am going to assume from for displayed ignorance that you have no idea as to the actual degree of the cost).


Why the hell do you think people want a lightning network?!?  It shows promise for thousands upon thousands of transactions per second (more than the final implementation of the BIP101 8GB block) at no cost to the decentralized nature of Bitcoin the currency/protocol.  You want to bump transactions to maybe 30/Sec--**which is still useless**--through the use of a clumsy, simple-minded method that comes at a cost to the decentralized nature of Bitcoin instead of waiting a few months for a no cost solution that provides Visa level throughput.  That's stupid!


I think you are too ignorant to realize this is a red herring.  Obviously, a LN implementation could settle thousands of transactions with one blockchain fee.  Therefore an individual will not pay the entire fee.  I don't know why you fabricated $20, but even if it were $20, that should be no big deal since it is spilt over thousands over transactions.
You need to get smarter.

I agree with Maxwell, and I don't agree that Bitcoin is fragile.  I think of it more like the anti-fragile honey badger.  Transactions will have higher fees for first block confirmation.  Big deal!
One little sniveler who runs a shitty altcoin mining pool was complaining the other day because he underestimated his fee to pay out multiple altcoin miners (in Bitcoin, not their mined shitcoins!!).  While blocks were full, he tried to pay many recipients--IN ONE LARGE TRANSACTION--with only a 12 cent miner fee.  He was furious that his 12 cents came at a wait of 80 blocks to confirm.  That is not a damn emergency.
@_date: 2015-12-31 17:58:03
Haha.  Thx.  I was hoping there was more than that.  This seems next to impossible, since the people required execute a hard fork (miners) would be acting against their own interest.  However, I guess present miners could quickly be replaced by new miners who could run on different equipment, but it seems like it would make the chain very vulnerable (at least for a time).
I'll ask to see what is working on.
I see the mining centralization issue to be one of the last that needs to be solved after the centralization has been used to implement lots of other needed changes.  Then, if you can break up the centralization, there becomes a solidification of the protocol after which there likely will be no other changes that require a hard fork.  Hopefully, the incentive to pool hash power can somehow be changed.
Anyway, thx again.

Knock it off (maybe show a little more humility?)
Otherwise, thanks for the code and comment.  However, rather than making BIP101 "supporter[s]" (which it clearly also did), I think more importantly it illustrated how inconsequential alternative implementations are to the developers.  It would have been easy to not count block.nVersions = (whatever BIP101 uses), but really... What is the point?  It doesn't matter anyway.

I believe you, and I also believe u/eragmus when he says you are sincere.  I appreciate your sincerity.
What plan are you advocating?
Back to the Mow position.  I suspect that what he actually means is that if fees start to get detrimentally high, he would support increasing block size regardless of Core's plan?  Would you agree?  Is there nuance I'm missing?  If that is what he's saying, then OP is likely taking the post out of context to make it more sensational, when in fact, if SW will delay heavy fees then Mow probably sees no urgency to buck status quo.  Again, do you agree?
I really want to understand his position and your position.  I poke fun of the angry (often ignorant) mob for fun and for impact.  But ultimately I really want to see Bitcoin succeed long-term (I'm heavily invested) and if you do too I want to hear you.  I am convinced that the best way to scale involves some sort of off-chain solution, and blocks that are too large are detrimental.  But I'm not vehemently opposed to some cap increase, but I also don't see an urgency for one either.

**LN is not a sidechain**. There is no chain (other than the Bitcoin blockchain).  It is Bitcoin.  Satoshi put in payment channels.  LN simply opens up payment channels and networks them through a routing system where a person on one channel can transact with a person on another by making several hops (in the background) through connected channels to reach their destination channel.  At any time a channel can close and finish the transaction on chain.  It is not a sidechain; it's Bitcoin.
Quit being confidently ignorant.
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:53:31
You never answered my question.  


You cited a paper dated in February, while I provided a podcast from November.  I know the number was originally cited and is in the white paper, but is it still true?
For instance, does SW change it?  (Surely it does, it could cut in almost in half or down to a quarter).  Also, they are citing a requirement of 3 MBit/s, but assuming IBLT.  Wouldn't we want to see IBLT implemented first?  They are also referring to Block pruning.  Wouldn't we need to see that first rather than requiring nodes to store 133MB every 10 minutes (who the hell is going to run that node?  I sure as hell will quit).  Does the number hold up if there are other ways found to reduce transaction size?  (No).
Right now there is a plan to increase throughput while IBLT and LN are developed.  Segwit is expected to be deployed in February, increasing throughput, fixing malleability, and allowing for easier implementation of additional improvements.  Then we should see IBLT and LN come into play, providing for a much less costly method of increasing the cap, and showing how much is truly required at the moment.  Meanwhile someone can be working on block pruning.  There is no present urgency to raise the cap, and by the time there is, if ever (meaning fees are becoming detrimentally high), we will likely be in a much better vantage point to determine what change is needed.  If you listen to the podcast, these guys describe the detriments of even small increases in block sizes (with the network in its current state).  So pushing it right now, just for the sake of doing it, is poor planning.  The better plan is already in play--make improvements that buy time to implement a much more elegant payment network and scaling means, then go from there with a much more informed perspective.

Fair enough (Mow said it).  However, if you read my other posts you'll see that my suspicion is that Mow's statements came before there was a roadmap in place that included Segwit.

He always finds some middle-of-the-road opinion to position himself as a compromiser who is above-it-all.  In truth, with developments taking place, all present fears of consequences from blocks filling are being alleviated by easy to implement developments.  Accordingly, there is obviously no pressing need to raise the cap.  Moreover, plans in development may make cap raising entirely unnecessary (and certainly will tell us how much is absolutely necessary).  Anyone can see this.

This is the point in the conversation where I know I have done my part.  Although you will not admit it (part of the human condition?), you now clearly understand what you did not a few comments earlier.  Hopefully other readers will as well.  You are correct, more than one thing affects price, and other things probably have a greater impact on price than the halving, which under efficient market theory should have very little.
Now to rebut myself a little:  I am not a true efficient market believer, and suspect that there could be enough ignorant market participants to make the halving an event that does catch some of the market by surprise--possibly enough of the market to make a price difference.  The effect of the market becoming aware could possibly be noticeable even before the actual halving.

That paper has been revised several times.  Is that number still true?  Because I listened to them recently on a podcast and they were seeming to think LN could work with a small block.

@_date: 2015-12-29 16:20:35
It's pretty simple really, and it all boils down to the fact that there are no trading fees and there is a very fast trading engine.
There are multiple bots performing high-frequency trading algorithms on the exchange.  Because the exchange has ZERO FEES, there is no disincentive to trade even the tightest margins.  Accordingly, when someone makes a big move (which may also be through wash trading to obscure the source and amount), the HFT bots go into a frenzy executing thousands of trades (both buy and sell) back and forth between one another creating huge volume spikes as multiple thousands of potential opportunities are being created to try to capture tiny margins.

Blockstream's business model is actually very risky, and only even possible by a select few.  They are investing in building a collection of expertise in a new and emerging field.  They want to be the go-to experts in the field of Blockchain technology.  In order to claim this title they are building Bitcoin into a robust (like TCP/IP) underlying and interoperable protocol.  When big players want to build systems to inter operate with Bitcoin Blockstream will be best positioned to provide those services.  Accordingly, they are investing in top talent to perfect Bitcoin (which includes a LN).
Of course, people have to be skeptical of Blockstream because there are potential conflicts of interest.  But potential conflicts of interest are not inherently bad, so long as there is disclosure (like here).  It appears that the Blockstream guys simply are capitalizing on the opportunity that exists to profit by perfecting Bitcoin.  That should not be hated at all.  This sort of collaborative ingenuity is great for Bitcoin and also allows for rewards to the diligent.  Win-Win.
Because of the potential for conflict, people must scrutinize Blockstream's efforts in order to make sure that they aren't building a Bitcoin that serves their ends despite harming the bigger ecosystem.  But careful consideration of all competing ideas persuades me (most developers, miners, and node operators) that the Bitcoin that suits their ends simultaneously is the best way to develop Bitcoin for scale.  Accordingly, their plans are winning in the marketplace of ideas.  But if their ends weren't aligned with Bitcoin's best scaling method their plan would never work.  This is evidenced by the fact that they are hated by many (less inclined Bitcoin enthusiasts) even though they are probably Bitcoin's best advocate.  They are smart guys for recognizing this opportunity early.  I wish they didn't have to put up with so much shit from an angry ignorant mob (I was guilty of this early on).

Bullshit.  It's not disingenuous at all.  Anyone can easily discern that in order to change the cap practical consensus is required.

This type of statement is inadmissible in court due to its unreliable nature.  It is laughable to try to pass it as reliable here without corroboration by Lee who has proven capable and willing to speak for himself.
@_date: 2015-12-24 03:43:56


You say compromise, but I'm not sure that you realize that you need practical consensus (damn near everyone) or else nothing changes.  You won't find a majority of stakeholders willing to nuke the whole thing with a premature hard fork, therefore without consensus there is deadlock which means status quo (1MB--you gotta love Bitcoin's immutability; there will be no tyranny of the majority).
But more importantly you are asking for consensus to develop around something dangerous and unnecessary at the present time.  It also may prove to never be necessary.  This month SW will be deployed on testnet.  It's expected to be ready to deploy by February.   .  This will provide the equivalent of 2MB, so that will delay your feared fee market while LN, IBLT, etc are developed.  Gavin's IBLT will make a cap increase, if necessary, less dangerous by greatly reducing the amount of data required to "propagate" blocks.  Meanwhile, you say LN is not near ready, but Maaku expects to be testing very very alpha versions by March and the project looks very promising.  I see no reason to "compromise"; all concerns are addressed.  I think you guys are going to have to get used to the idea that Bitcoin is going to thrive despite (because?) you aren't getting your way.
You guys need to cool it and start being polite to the very generous guys at Blockstream and the Core team who are doing a fantastic job in the face of relentless defamatory character attacks over the last year.

The post is not so insightful that others have not considered.  You are buying so that you can sell later (or somehow realize your increased value).  Suppose others are doing the same, an obvious strategy.  If so, when the halving occurs, does it seem likely that the supply decrease may have already been factored in to the price by the market?
Consider... You are already inflating the price today in anticipation of a known event that will certainly take place in a year.  Why would the market not have this already priced in?

Argue about it all you want; altcoins will exist.  People will compete.  The only reasonable course of action is to do your best to win that competition.

His point is that people need to be warned and that it would be wrong (criminal) if the developers don't do that.  But everyone has been warned, therefore his point is null.

Segwit will make the equivalent of this test.  We will see how propagation times are affected.  Then, if IBLT (Gavin's brilliant idea) is implemented the propagation time likely becomes even less of an issue.  Further, if a micropayment solution gets implemented (duplex or lightning--several versions are in the works and CLTV has just become enforced), then there could be lessening of on chain transactions.  Accordingly, with Segwit there is less of an immediate need to raise the cap (which is still at an average of about 750k).  And with the other developments it may not ever (but likely will).  So simply put, you say raise the cap to see what happens, but Segwit will satisfy that question, so it makes no sense to still raise the cap (for this purpose).


No it has not.  Changing the protocol is not at the mercy of majority rule, rather requires practical consensus (otherwise you are exercising a destructive nuclear option).


Not true, if 51% try it, they will at best destroy all their value.


I think we've found practical consensus (amongst miners and developers) and mass approval of enough node operators--CLTV, CSV, Segwit, IBLT, micropayment channel networks, then reevaluate.  The system is working well.  There is a loud minority who work themselves into a groupthink of delusional self-importance and then demand bigger blocks without consensus (they can barely mine a block in a week).  But they aren't getting their way.  So, looks good to me.
@_date: 2015-06-10 18:57:36
Obviously node operators need incentives.  Maybe a percentage of the block reward?  Need to look into alts to see which has the best solution and then emulate.  After all, that is the best reason for supporting alts.
Incentivize nodes, increase block size, lightning network, and confidential transactions.  That solves all but one of my worrisome problems: the miners' incentive to mine under the largest pool.

Back in the day, this was what we all did.  It was practically required to have a wallet.  Just download the software QT and run it.  To actually help the network, you do have to forward port 8333.
After you do this, you can venture out to running bitcoind instead of Bitcoin-QT.  It is a command line version of the same thing (for ELI5 purposes).  Then, once you get comfortable with that, you can configure your OS to run bitcoind at startup.  As you leave your computer running, you are running a full node.  It's all pretty easy.  However, nothing is simpler than downloading QT, running it, and configuring your router to forward port 8333.
@_date: 2015-06-15 16:08:36
Yeah, but mostly what Hearn did was copy -qt to form -xt.  Anyone can do the same with xt or qt.  While the control over the project may rest with Hearn, the important "control," which is control over the protocol, rests with the users who decide which version to run.
This principle is demonstrated by Hearn's offering of an alternative.  The move shows that any "core developer" only has power if users support them.  As such, the move manifests Bitcoin's truly decentralized nature.
However, there is an inertia that must be overcome by anyone proposing an alternative.  It will generally be more difficult to persuade people to change than to stay the same.  As such, I don't foresee constant switching, but only a switch/fork over big issues.

I think the Internet is a more proper analogy.  Companies like AOL and CompuServe hoped the Internet would be the backend and they would provide a front end, because the Internet is "too complicated."  At the time, it was easy to believe the Internet was too complicated, because people acted that way.  However, it turns out that just because people treated it like it was too complicated did not make that idea true.  
Bitcoin usage is far less complicated than the Internet was back in the day.  People can understand it, and it will become beneficial to use.  Particularly, it will become beneficial to use when merchants begin offering discounts for paying with Bitcoin (smart merchants will begin doing this).

In May of 2014 there was a belief by some that the "bubble cycle" would repeat itself just like before.  Those who believed bought in, and many who didn't believe bought in as well, attempting to profit from the fools who did believe.  A user named Quintin and a user named moral_agent were the biggest pushers of this theory.  Quintin was an idiot, but moral was simply posting persuasive numbers (actually providing a useful service).  While they were wrong, the hype they created was a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy.  That's the real story.  It had almost nothing to do with EMA's, although there was certainly excitement every time some arbitrary lines crossed.  For you to expect a repeat is really just a repeat of their mistakes.

Why is it sad?  You seem to not want it to work by majority consensus.
Maybe you meant to say "sadly this is how it works"?  That makes more sense, as it would make you sad that people don't have to follow a few developers (including you) standing in the way of progress just so they can feel somewhat more influential than they previously felt.  Or maybe it makes you sad that people can opt out your plan to make Blockstream more relevant?

This would suppress the price by the same amount even if there were going to be no halving.  The fear of failure is unrelated to the halving.  When the halving occurs, it will do nothing to alleviate that fear.  
What makes you think the price isn't already reflecting a proper accounting of the halving?  There is no risk associated with the halving; it's just a known event that is certain to occur.

They are as theoretical as blueprints to a home.  So are the consequences of a contentious hard fork to raise the cap.  There are some degrees of certainty that can be had prior to implementation, but the highest degrees of certainty are only attainable once implemented.  But that does not mean that we can't have adequate certainty that something will work or that something will cause harm.  Segwit is agreed to be easy to implement by practically all experts.  And protocols similar to LN have been designed and implemented in the past (e.g. TCP/IP, SMTP, TOR, and even Bitcoin) so experts are able to have reasonable certainty as to whether or not similar plans (like LN) should work.  Additionally, it's fairly easy to attain adequate certainty that implementing block size increases of a certain amount (the LN guys said around 4MB, which also happens to be the maximum possible equivalence from Segwit) that propagation times reduce to a level that detrimentally reduces network reliability, resulting in greater frequency of orphans and reorgs.  This additionally opens the door for selfish mining attacks which leads to further centralization.  Of course none of this can be known with absolute certainty, **but it is all reasonably foreseeable**.


In court, this would be considered "proven."  We would simply rely on the overwhelming amount of expert testimony.


Yes it is.  I suppose the network could handle 1.33 MB right now, and if consensus were formed around it, I would not withhold my consent.  But, I am certainly not going to advocate for it, because it is not necessary and the better plan is to wait.  Moreover, in my wildest fantasies Bitcoin would run on less than 1MB blocks.  And the only reason I can see for pushing for such a slight increase is to somehow get your way, which I don't care about.  I don't care one bit if there is a tiny group of loud dissenters who get their feelings hurt by having their impotence shown when they have chosen (against wiser counsel) to fall on the wrong side of this debate.

Even if what you say is true it would seem then that Bitcoin would create a sort of tragedy-of-the-commons situation where even though it's bad for the economic whole, individuals still choose it because it is best for the individual.  After all, who wants to be punished for saving money (inflation)?
To be certain, I'm not convinced that a commodity based economy can't thrive, but am just accepting the premise to make the point.

Miners and Node operators.  The rest of you, if you aren't at least one of these are free-loaders whose voice is loud, but meaningless.  Consensus is required by that group to raise the block size.  That group can choose to run whatever code they like.  Of course that group is influenced by the users who make up the economy, because the users establish the price.  Your small group of dissenters is loud and obnoxious, but ultimately meaningless, because you aren't affecting price (price has nearly doubled since your failed attempts to hijack Bitcoin), you aren't hashing, and you aren't running many nodes.  If you were smarter, you'd realize what group consensus applies to, but instead you just bitch.
In addition to bitching, you guys have even raised money to spam the hell out of the chain through "stress tests" designed solely to force XT on the consensus.  Yet you act as though you are somehow holier than thou when people respond in kind.  What a joke!


Speaking of conflicts of interest.  Now you are suggesting we hand over the reigns to a group of business owners who might see a quick valuation bump by being able to proclaim "scalability" but have no interest in the decentralized nature of Bitcoin.  Of course you have a couple of them on your side.  Fortunately, until they destroy value (which is not in their interest) or start mining their voice is almost as meaningless as the rest of you bitches.  Everyone can see what is driving their choice, and it's clearly what's in the best interest of their company, not Bitcoin.
Fortunately, Bitcoin was designed in such a way as to make it immutable (as a ledger and as a protocol when it comes to removing restrictions).  A loud handful of users aren't going to just change it.  If it were not this way, it would not be valuable.  But because it is, I have the assurance of knowing that you idiots can't fuck it up either out of stupidity or profiteering.  Instead of trying to hijack our blockchain, you need to start a new one with whatever properties you like.  In fact there is probably already one in existence and Bitcoin is open source, so it will require very little work.


You guys are a very small percentage.  You coalesce in two subreddits.  Those subreddits are tiny in comparison to this one.  Moreover, these subs are only representative of the English speakers who use Reddit.  But Bitcoin is global.  You guys are insignificant.  Most of you have declared that you are selling off until you get your way, yet the price has doubled.  You are not "lots and lots," but instead just loud and obnoxious on Reddit.  You've become a bunch of trolls.


This is the only remaining pacifier you can suck on to feel better about the fact that no one wants to run that shit.  There are 500 XT nodes and have been for months.  Yet you are claiming that no one wants to run one because of DOS.  Bullshit.  You've just peaked in numbers.  Otherwise there would not even be 500.  Come off it.  You've been in the circle jerk so long that you can't think straight.


Wrong again dipshit.  This is how I know that you are few:  Price has doubled since your failure became evident; you can only get 10% of nodes; like 2 developers; 2 out of 1000 blocks maximum; and 0 pools.  You have been disillusioned by the circlejerk to be convinced that you are significant notwithstanding the score.  You guys have been handed a glorious defeat--you have not even scored once.  And now, you are begging for any "compromise" so that you don't have to experience the shameful display of your utter impotence.  You don't want to have to accept that you've been in a tiny circlejerk.  Accordingly, you guys are now begging to accept Peter Todd's 2MB proposal, which you initially scoffed at, just to avoid the acknowledgment of your complete impotence.  But like I said from the beginning,  screw'em.  You guys can suffer the internal humiliation.  You're a bunch of bitches.

In fact, it's so useful that he might even be able to offer substantial discounts (5%??) to customers who pay with Bitcoin.
I know plenty of other consumer average Joes who could benefit from a discount on purchases.  Those consumers could simply open a bitreserve account and purchase things (big and tall clothing) with Bitcoin (when incentivized) and save money while never dealing with volatility risk.

At that point everyone will have both a safer means of raising the cap and a better vantage point to know how much (if any) is necessary.  If you're still around then, you can make a shameful attempt to save face by proclaiming victory.

You know, you strike me as a fantastic person.  I've watched you for years now with the same cynical perspective I take with most people.  Yet, I have never once seen you do anything petty.  That's impressive.  Notwithstanding how sanctimonious I may act when I'm not under the microscope, I certainly would have cracked by now in your position.
With that said, I am not sure what kind of control you have over appointing additional core devs, but I presume great control.  I wanted to toss an idea at you from FDR's playbook.  Regardless of what you think of FDR's policies, his politics, when in a similar situation as yours, were highly effective.  The Supreme Court kept ruling that his bills were unconstitutional (they were).  He pointed out that the Constitution does not fix the number of Supreme Court Justices, thus, in order to lighten their heavy workload, he was generously willing to appoint six more, bringing the total to 15.  Within short time the rulings became favorable without any change in the number of Justices.  To be certain, I don't think you could see results this easily in your current predicament--you'll have to act.
Given your connection with MIT you might now have access to some of the best young talent in the country.  What a recruitment opportunity, and after all, Bitcoin could use more good devs.  Of course, as you bring new devs on, it might be time to shuffle some off as they become too busy with other projects (Blockstream) to devote the time the new devs can devote.
Just some food for thought.  If you don't have this power, that's too bad.  You're a solid dude and Satoshi obviously chose well--at least in by my unimportant standards.
Thank you.

Ironically, voting mechanisms are most valuable when issues are somewhat contentious.  
Thankfully, the power-tripping individuals really don't have that much power to trip over.  Bitcoin.org is just one website.  There can be many.  Bitcointalk.org is just a cheesy forum, easily replaced/duplicated.  Bitcoin-qt is just a project that can be duplicated.  What none of these people can do is stop progress if the network users want it.  Someone can simply copy the code, make the changes, and post it for others.  The users will decide.  There is no monopoly.  Control over project QT is not control over Bitcoin, but simply a present ability to create surmountable obstacles.
It was a political risk to resist this growth.  While they may feel that it is too late to turn back now, that's still a better option than moving forward with continued resistance.  I predict continued resistance.

People have been contending over it for months.  It's contentious.
I have already switched a node to XT.  I have chosen my side of the contest.
The less influential core developers are clearly just vying for more power.  They have thrown down the gauntlet and will stick with it until the end; if they concede now, they actually lose influence.  This is a contentious matter and XT is an end run around a group of little bitches.  There is no need to get too caught up in it.  If you are scared then sell down in the meantime.  If you run a node or mining equipment, then choose a path and prepare to follow it.  The drama is no more than children (lesser cores) throwing fits.  They present their position as if they win by people not supporting larger blocks (could be true for the blockstreamers), but in actuality they are happy simply if people are arguing with them.  The argument makes them feel heard, which makes them feel more influential, which is their primary motivation.  Just a bunch of little bitches contending for power.
The good thing is that you don't have to get involved.  You can simply choose your code.  Bitcoin is awesome!
I choose larger blocks for the obvious reason that Bitcoin will break/cease to scale without them.  If this BIP100 thing is good it can be implemented after the block size increase.
@_date: 2015-12-30 01:44:30
Unfortunately, simple-minded bad ideas often have more staying power than great ideas that are only slightly complicated.  XT may die as name, but it's stupid premise will likely continue.  
Fortunately, Bitcoin is practically immutable without consensus, so a relatively small minority (in this case we have a large majority) can veto changes that require a hard fork.  So let them bitch forever :).

The author is right about one thing.  The major financial institutions don't need Bitcoin in order to speed up their centralized systems.

I guess there is perceived leverage in trying to paint the other side as the one seeking to change Bitcoin.  Accordingly, Gavin and Jeff resort to transparent linguistic tricks to try to make no change = change.  Anyone who falls for this is not too bright.  Make no mistake, since 2010 Bitcoin has had a cap, and the devs who want that changed are the ones who want Bitcoin to change in its fundamentals.
The economics of Bitcoin have always been subject to market pressures (both the price and fees), and these pressures are derived by the fact that there are hard coded scarcities--there are scheduled reward limits and maximum block sizes.  When there is greater demand and supply is fixed, prices (of Bitcoin and transactions) increase.  This has been true since 2010.  Nothing is changing.

It's safer to raise the cap once Gavin's IBLT proposal is implemented it's more dangerous without it.

You said this.


I said this.


You criticized me saying that this is only applicable under current dynamics, but will be different when the fee market is in place.
But that is not true.  Clearly you didn't understand how this works.  So now you come back to say that things will be different because blocks might always be full and fees won't erratic.  But even so what I said is still true--transactions don't fall off of the blockchain (like you said), "they sit in the mempool.  They may confirm next block or next....  Users could RBF (after 0.12) if they are trying to be cheap."  This is true no matter what the fees are.
I don't know why I'm even talking to you.  You have no idea what you're talking about, but you are somehow confident you are right (probably a reflection of the crowd you keep).

Not sure.  Don't need to be, as time will tell, and SW has bought time.  And even if SW had not, the only thing that happens is fees increase a little.
However, there is evidence.  There is a white paper written that describes an implementation.  This is kindof like blue prints to a building that has not yet been built.  And as an architect can analyze blueprints and determine whether the building will likely stand if built, so too can an expert coder analyze the LN white paper and develop a reasonable expectation of whether it will work or not.  After all, LN is not too unlike other protocols that have been built (e.g. TCP/IP, SMTP, tor, Bitcoin).
Presently there are at least three different implementations of payment channel routing networks being developed.  Most of those who are experts agree that it will work.  I don't know what your knowledge is with the topic of evidence, but expert testimony is very strong evidence.  So with their affirmative approval of the LN plan, we can have *some certainty* that LN will work.  But of course, as with buildings, the only way to know with the *highest certainty* of whether a software implementation will work is to build it.
Fortunately, we have time to build it.  Segwit will be implemented soon, which will reduce fee pressure.  Then IBLT/LN is planned.  After these developments we will have a much less costly way of raising the cap, and we will know whether it is even necessary.  It's really an easy decision.  The only reason most are still zealously pushing for a hard fork at the moment is because they are stubborn (i.e. they don't want to acknowledge their shameful impotence).

I just want to make sure you realize that the enforcement number on that page will need to reach 100%.  We are about 92% to 95%.  We need to reach 100% of 95%.  The easy way to tell is just by looking at the block count which is still in the upper 800s, which means we are at 8x.x%.
But still, it's close (about 3.5-4.5 days out).  Antpool has apparently switched completely, such that total switched is about 99% of hash power, so now we just wait until old v3 blocks are replaced.
Edit: 2.5-3.5 days.  That's about how long it will take to go through the ~440 blocks required to replace the 68 v3 blocks standing in the way of 950.
@_date: 2015-12-16 17:33:15
You can keep repeating this, but still...


It should naturally follow without the need for statement that every user knows or should know (because of ample opportunity to learn) that blocks are capped at 1MB and that might not change.  Moreover, if anyone has done the due diligence to learn about the protocol, they should understand that its immutable design makes it more likely than not that 1MB is here to stay.
Everyone has been warned.  Even if they had not, there is certainly nothing "criminal" going on.
It's one thing to use hyperbole to emphasize a point, but the statement quoted above is mostly disingenuous.

Chargebacks are higher in some industries regardless of the business practices.  
Also, even if poor business practices lead to the chargebacks Bitcoin is still useful to that business.

In a discussion with toomim I posted this






With his one substantive post, I still can't tell what his plan of action is.  But it appears to be only that if fees get detrimentally high and core does nothing about it, then they will break from following them.  In other words, if SW performs as promised, then they are not in the immediate future about to do anything.  It's very non-committal (probably because he has a boss to answer to who knows that taking a hard stance is risky business).

Because 2-7 transactions per second is not enough to scale.  It's extremely obvious.  There is not even a curtain to peek behind.  On the other hand, there may be some questionable motives behind some who oppose.  There is certainly the appearance of impropriety.  Peek behind the curtains that do exist.
Allowing for a 75% supermajority from the group arguably least incentivized to accept the change is beyond amiable.  Realize that Gavin could simply revoke commit access for these core devs who like to sit around and inhale their own shit fumes.  But instead of being aggressive, he's simply playing nice while still asserting a position that needs to be asserted.  For Christ's sake, he's still leaving the matter to be decided by the players who could be harmed the most--by a SUPERMAJORITY.  What a nice fucking dude.

But also don't underestimate the belligerence of free-loving people when their liberty is infringed upon.  During another era there was a somewhat benevolent dictator who tried to tax American colonies for the consumption of tea but without any sort of adequate representation.  Those Americans took that tea and threw it in the Boston harbor started rioting and called it a party.  An independent state was born.
I don't know what people will do, but passive complacency is not a given.  If our government tried to ban Facebook they would likely be hastily replaced.  If Cryptocurrency starts enticing users with features that previously were not available with fiat to the point where national currencies become destabilized (people are hooked), it could be too late for banning.  Or...as you suggest, they could respond in the same way they did with gold.  But by that time with gold, most people had already been baited-and-switched such that they considered paper to be "real money" and gold to be something for jewelry (therefore the fight might not have been worth fighting).

Ultimately, the hatred stems from self-doubt (an uncomfortable feeling).
Life's pretty good for many people.  Things are working well.  Bitcoin threatens to disrupt everything.  While at first glance, and even after careful consideration, this threat seems ludicrous to many, the damn thing just keeps growing in acceptance.  No matter how much of a joke they think Bitcoin, the fact that it will not go away makes them doubt.  That doubt creates an uncomfortable cognitive dissonance.  
Additionally, ego is challenged by Bitcoin's growth due to previous dismissals of the technology.  People will fight hard to protect ego.
In my view, people hate Bitcoin because previous dismissals make it imperative to their egos that Bitcoin must fail, and if it doesn't fail, then it promises to disrupt everything.  And they don't want things disrupted.  Moreover, they certainly don't want to have to acknowledge that parts of their worldview might be flawed; it makes everything you believe seem uncertain.  That's frightening!  So, being normal, they fight the threat to alleviate discomfort.

SW is to be deployed this month on testnet and is expected to be ready to roll out in February (BIP101 would not even activate until mid January).  See  It will give the effect of a cap increase, which will give data about how the network handles the propagation delays.  So that is a very "clear indication" of when there is a block size increase (or the equivalent in terms of transaction throughput).  But a few loud and angry people will still be pissed off because that is what loud angry people do.  They would be wise to cool their jets, but wisdom seems to allude them.
I'm not convinced that a block increase will ever be needed.  But if a significant increase is needed, it would be best (by far) to have IBLT in place first.  SW will buy the time for that.  Additionally, there are also measures being looked at to reduce the data size of transactions even further.  Moreover, LN, which is being actively developed, shows great promise to reduce transaction load.  Just today I read (don't remember the source, might not be reliable) that 45% of transactions are for less than one dollar.  There is and has been great stuff in the works, and doing something dangerous and unnecessary just to appease some unimportant screamers is unwise.

I don't know.  Sounds likely, but probably due more to when there are volatile trading movements.  There are times with higher demand, but I don't know that they are predictable periods.


This is true.  Bitcoin does not scale well by simply raising the cap.  Block propagation times quickly start to decline and equate to high orphan rates.  This is why payment channel network solutions (which were only introduced last February) are so important--it's way to scale by keeping many transactions off-chain.  This will allow for those less valuable use cases that would otherwise be too costly due to fees.
With regard to the propagation times, Segwit is going to test this a little.  Then Gavin's great idea of IBLT, once implemented, should ameliorate the negative effect on propagation delays that raising the cap would otherwise (and presently) create.  Maybe by then we will be able to more safely raise, if necessary.
If you're hanging out with the wrong crowd you won't know this, but the future is looking very bright for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-16 15:16:59
You are arguing about it. It's contentious.  Who cares?  Voting mechanisms are most valuable for contentious matters.  Bitcoin.org is practically negligible in this, as only the informed are choosing which code to run.  The informed aren't looking to Bitcoin.org (an easily competed with website).

Strawman.  I never said that (Don't put words in my mouth--it's cheap and suggests that maybe you don't quite live up to the noble claims of putting argument over ego).  What I said was that everyone is aware that a fee market is likely to come because it is so hard to gain concensus and that fact has been demonstrated on all Bitcoin forums for the better half of a year.  Therefore his point is not valid that people need to be made aware. Everyone knows that without a cap raise (or Segwit, etc) fee raises are imminent.  Furthermore, everyone knows that a cap raise is unlikely due difficulty in achieving necessary consensus for a hard fork.


No it's not.  As stated above, everybody knows that once capacity is reached fees rise.  Everyone still knows that.  Segwit (brilliantly and for one time only) is an unforeseen and pleasant surprise that raises capacity to a point, but beyond that, when capacity is reached again, everyone still expects that consensus for a hard fork will be needed to expand again.  There is nothing null about saying that people are already aware--they have been and still are.


I would not have put a fight for raising the cap to 2MB knowing that micropayment channels are in development but have not seen it as necessary unless fees begin to raise dramatically.


So ugly that it is likely no one would win.  It's a nuclear option.  Kamikaze.

They probably own Bitcoin and think (probably in error), that if they can force a block increase they can get a price bump by being able to proclaim scalability.  They'll then sell out to greater fools to deal with the problems they create that come later as blocks get bigger and propagation slows.  This would explain why people post like they are paid--they have a pecuniary interest.
It explains why I fight with zeal for an actual long-term solution.  I am one of those rare few who does not want to think of myself as selling bullshit.

It is being dealt with.  Presently Segwit will buy time before the event you fear.  IBLT will make cap raises more possible.  And there are three iterations of payment channel networks being developed.  Those are all very forward thinking things, the present mindset is to simply clumsily raise the cap.  There are far more elegant solutions in the works.  So while there is no emergency people need to take some Valium (or at least back off the coffee) and let the better more forward thinking solutions develop.

@_date: 2015-12-30 03:04:12


Bingo!!!  All the smarter people argue this.  Raising the cap comes at a cost (potentially major cost) to Bitcoin.  The "second layer" solution comes at no cost to Bitcoin--it could actually reduce costs to Bitcoin operators.  So because there is no urgency and because Segwit is going to delay any urgency even more, we have plenty of time to wait for the solution that has cost benefits rather than hastily implement a clumsy simple-minded solution to a problem that is not even yet urgent.  Furthermore, even if those solutions aren't ready in time, the only consequence is increased fees.  And fees can increase several times before becoming anywhere close to detrimental.  There is no emergency.
Accordingly, this type of decision making is simple.  Wait for the better solution since the other can always be implemented, comes at a cost, and is not urgently needed.
Your side understands this, which is why you are all trying your Hail Mary to get any increase whatsoever so as not to feel impotent.

For as much as you like Bitcoin, it seems that you understand it as much as Lastpass.  Lastpass could easily implement Bitcoin payments through a service like Bitpay or Coinbase.  Those services can automatically convert the coins to "real currency" for less than the cost of any mainstream payment provider (i.e. Visa, Mastercard).

The main reason this is huge is LEGITIMACY
So many small business owners presently use quickbooks.  Intuit is a company they know and trust.  If they support bitcoin then many of those people will conclude that maybe bitcoin is not just some weird trend or scam and decide to really look into it.
Also, how many accountants will come to the same conclusion.  So many mainstream Americans rely on their tax preparer for basic financial advice.  Soon those accountants will quit calling it a ponzi scheme and suggest looking into it if nothing more.
It's not the same as Visa or PayPal coming out in support and it's certainly not the same as the FED giving their stamp, but Intuit is very trusted and this really adds legitimacy to bitcoin.

Which developers’ minds?  Certainly not all of them.  Also, how do you know what is in their minds?  They could be being disingenuous.  To call this an alt-coin is an equivocation.  To illustrate: the original client had no Block size cap.  Was it not Bitcoin, or is the present iteration not Bitcoin?  Or, maybe none of them are Bitcoin?


It is exactly a word trick, and not a very clever one.  It’s tantamount claiming to have a new car after only changing the tires or removing the governor.  In some useless sense that could be true, if you take an extreme view of the meaning of the word “new.”   Afterall, it’s not exactly the same.  However, there’s no pratical reason for taking this view other than to manipulate. 


We who?  Did you do this?  Is there some conspiracy that you are privy to?


You’re a dipshit giving a highbrowed lecture simply for the appearance of giving a lecture, but what you say is meaningless.
Altcoin means, among other things, not Bitcoin.  Yet, Bitcoin changes.  At some point, Bitcoin could change to the point that it is no longer reasonably considered Bitcoin.  The question of where to draw that line is a question of degree (maybe a thing someone like you has trouble with).  Questions of degree are typically disagreed upon by reasonable minds.  However, unlike any other “alt-coin,” if this fork is successful, we will have a currency called Bitcoin; all wallet addresses will remain the same with the same balances; wallets and serives will function the same way; and Bitpay/Coinbase will still work in the same way and so will all of the exchanges.  Regardless of whether reasonable minds can agree on where to draw the line of distinction between Bitcoin and altcoin, no reasonable mind could consider this change to be creating an altcoin.  No altcoin has ever had these characteristics, unless you say Satoshi created an altcoin by implementing the Block cap.  The only reason to call it an altcoin is to manipulate, as Luke-Jr. is attempting to do, AGAIN.  
Junior is a less influential developer hoping to gain more influence.  Accordingly, he is resorting to embarrassing tactics that will certainly fail.  He may create bothersome surmountable obstacles, but he will lose influence.

Their debt is in USD.  Because of this they have an option called monetizing the debt, which simply means that they borrow more USD from the FED (whose chairman is appointed by the president) to pay off their current debt.  Now they only owe the FED, which has no means of collecting and only exists at the leisure of congress.  I think that this is the reason they should be terrified of bitcoin, because it could put an end to this accounting trick called "national debt" which is actually just printing money.

I just gave you the name of a person arrested.  Earlier you said that the courts don't recognize bitcoin as money but in his case the us federal judge defined bitcoin as money.  Later you said they let him walk, but I don't know where you got that from.  I believe the case is ongoing for Trendon Shavers.  I could be wrong on that, but in all honesty I think you are just trying to backpedal from your original claims.
I think the bottom line is that it is clear that the courts will go after Bitcoin thieves and they do recognize Bitcoin, not only as a thing of value, but, in at least one US District, also as money.  
If it can be proven that there is fraud on the part of MK he could be facing some serious consequences.

I'm all for appealing to authority--some experts have been proven smarter than most--but who the hell is jtoomim?
Regardless, this is the stupidest idea I have heard with regard to the irreversibility of a hard fork.  First, while it is false, even if it were true, this requires the good nature of an exchange to reverse--it's not a decision in the hands of the users (So stupid).  But more importantly, ff they can only convince a small amount of hash power, then what secures the chain from the majority of hash power who they are trying to disenfranchise from blowing their shit up and reorging back to their will?  If the answer is because the exchange won't let them, then how the hell is different from any other centralized solution?  If it's no different, do you think people will continue to use that exchange who is breaking all their other shit?  Of course not, so that exchange loses most of their customers.  Any exchange who has a lot of customers can foresee this obvious outcome before trying.  Accordingly, they will of course not try this stupid nonsense that will ruin their business.
This is the type of disingenuous argument that is made to persuade stupid people to agree with you without merit.  It does not work on smart people, which is why all of the smart people (developers, miners, mining pools, 90% of node operators) reject this ridiculous nonsense.  The whole design of Bitcoin is to prevent this type of control by a single entity, who will be excluded if they try.

I think bankruptcy law is going to demand the liquidation of bitcoin assets just like other assets in order to partially satisfy debts.

TL;DR Jurors take oaths not to nullify.  They can be held in contempt for trying.  It is well established law that this is not their purpose.
Yes, in short it is, I was posting this only to make sure anyone who reads the other posts knows that it is not the purpose of the jury to acquit.  This was just a short blurb.  To add to what was on my page, see the law, and a couple of case cites below.
Nullification occurs when a juror violates his or her oath by failing to apply the law as instructed by the court thereby acquitting a defendant even though the government has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  1 Fed. Jury Prac. &amp; Instr. § 5:16 (6th ed.), 1 Fed. Jury Prac. &amp; Instr. § 5:16 (6th ed.)
In People v. Kriho, the trial court held a juror in contempt after he advocated jury nullification to another juror.  People v. Kriho, 996 P.2d 158 (Colo. Ct. App. 1999).  In 2000, The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit approved striking a potential juror because of his assertion that a criminal jury always has the power to acquit.  United States v. James, No. 98-1479, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 1738, at *6 (10th Cir. Feb. 7, 2000).

You're lying, maybe not about your story, but definitely about your conclusion.  There's no damn way after 2014 you've become 100% certain that this is a scam, not as the rest of the world is coming to the opposite conclusion.
Studying Bitcoin leads a reasonable person to the opposite conclusion.  The people who (in good faith) claim scam usually do so with knee-jerk reaction like they would with an email from a Nigerian prince.  It's a reasonable knee-jerk.   However, the people who have spent a year studying do not conclude this in good faith.
Also, someone who is 100% convinced of a scam shou 'll d be cutting their losses.  Why are you still holding 100 Bitcoin? (And announcing it on Reddit like no normal person would do).  As I type this I call bullshit on the facts of your story as well.
@_date: 2014-09-12 21:17:32
I don't find it upsetting.  I even said that it is arguably true.
Regardless of whether it is true, when a reasonable person chooses to save (which you foolishly argue against ever doing),  that person will, when given an informed choice, choose a store of value that maintains or increases value, rather than one that will depreciate, in spite of a possible detriment to the whole economy.  This is the essence of a "tragedy of the commons."
You started your thread explaining that we need central banks because of the stimulating and stabilizing effect that they have on the economy through steady and predictable inflation.  My point, which you made difficult to get to, is this:
Stimulation and stabilisation provided by central banks may be a desirable benefit that they arguably provide, but, they are not necessary.  If Bitcoin were to grow to a point that it stabilizes in value, it will be a preferred store of value for the individual, in spite of the fact that it may not be most beneficial to the whole of society.  Bitcoin, or something like it, has the potential to kill central banks, even if everybody agrees that that is bad for the economy.  To you specifically:  Arguing the benefits that central banks provide to the economic whole is pointless, because individuals give very little consideration to the economic whole and instead focus on their individual condition, and for the individual condition it is never good to have savings eroded by inflation.  Even if you win your argument and make your point that inflation is good for the whole, therefore good for the individual, you still won't persuade people to act accordingly.  If you would there would be no such thing as a "tragedy of the commons."  Unfortunately we see this behavior often.

"But why would anyone spend bitcoins if they are deflationary?"
Well that settles it there is no possible answer to this rhetorical question so Bitcoin will fail.
From now on if I have a choice between money that is guaranteed to lose value or money that could gain or hold I will choose the money that loses value.  I'm sure you all will too.  Otherwise we will all be stuck with money that will kill us because we will be unable to purchase even our basic necessities for fear of losing future value.  This is also the reason I never invest my money in anything that could become more valuable like stocks.

I love airbitz.  I have been using the wallet since announced.  I love the fact that the directory is within app.  In fact, about a year ago someone asked what for suggestions for a bitcoin app and I suggested an HD wallet that would work across platforms with a built in directory. 
Airbitz is a little different from what I had in mind because it requires a central authority.  That scares me with larger amounts.  Maybe it shouldn't.  I don't know how much trust it requires from me, and uncertainty equals risk.  With a HD wallet with no central authority I only trust myself.  However, I am a little surprised that no one has made this easy yet.
It would seem like there would be multiple standalone wallets that could support a multiple word master key that would work on all of them in the same way.
I'll look into Airbitz (and Coinkite) a bit more.  I just really would prefer to host my own wallet.  The only two benefit I can see with an online service is a sync'd record of transactions (if I give names to the transactions).
Thanks for making the software.  When I suggest a wallet to people new to Bitcoin it's airbitz.  It is friendly and the directory is awesome.

Prices are always determined by a market function.  A stable currency (like the USD presently is) makes this function easier, but a less stable one doesn't make it impossible.  
As Bitcoin is adopted the price of a bitcoin rises making it such that the same amount of wealth ($$) that purchases bitcoin today will purchase much less in the future.  This therefore reduces volatility making the market function mentioned above easier and easier to take place until pricing in another currency isn't necessary.
I'm not saying that bitcoin will replace fiat, but I think there is a clear path for reducing volatility, which is ultimately adoption (as a store of value) which increases the price to a point where it takes massive amount of wealth to purchase even a small % of the total supply of bitcoin.

Value can be attributed to anything that is scarce and has utility.  Bitcoin's "math" creates units of account that are perfectly scarce and perfectly useful as a currency, therefore valuable.  What value they are given is determined by the collective marketplace, and that value is correlated to the number of participants in its marketplace.

I finally finished the whole video.  The beginning talked about this (a little in the middle too).  Really no solution, only that there is no incentive, too costly, and if it happens we'll simply fix it then.  If it's that easy, why not fix it now?
I thought it was interesting though that he pointed out how terracoin died due to a 51% mining power grab.  Also, that he pointed out how difficult it is to change a protocol, because of the network effect (IPV4 just won't die, and can't be altered).  But in the same talk, glossed over the 51% problem as though we'll just fix it when it occurs.
I've been in Bitcoin since early 2012.  I'm not trying to find flaws.  I just can't help but notice this one.  I would love to have it explained in such a way that causes me to no longer have a concern about it, or in the alternative see a solution that prevents the possibility.
I do take comfort in knowing that there is not a lot of financial incentive to do this, also in the fact that there is strong incentive to stop it.  I'd take more comfort if it couldn't be done.  Historically people have broken a lot of shit just for the hell of it.

Yes.  That's why gold is so valuable because it's usefulness in making spoon.  Gold derives its full market value from its usefulness in making $1300 spoons.  /s 
It's like Schiff doesn't think people have the ability to see that, although gold has some value derived from its utility in making spoons, it derives most of its market value from its usefulness as an easily transported/traded store of value.

I didn't see where this mentions fiat.  I'd like to know that they also have all fiat accounted for and in reserve.
Since they are the ones requesting the audit, they could simply take all the fiat that they have and purchase up bitcoin right before the audit.  In the event that they did this, we would probably see a bump in the price like we've seen recently.
I'm not saying they did this, but if we knew the fiat reserves were audited too, then I'd be satisfied that they aren't running a fractional reserve.

It's prima facie irony.  However, it should take a person with average intelligence just a small amount of deeper analysis to recognize that praising Bitcoin for the fact that no middleman is required is not inconsistent with, at the same time, suggesting middlemen to businesses who prefer (are required) to deal in official currencies.
Although it is still true that Bitcoin requires no middlemen, at the present, it's lack of widespread usage makes it difficult to operate in Bitcoin as a primary currency, assuming employers and vendors haven't adopted the currency.  Therefore, any business that accepts Bitcoin will likely to convert much of it to a currency.  This is a perfect task for a middleman, although it can be done without one.
With all "official" currencies, a middleman is required to send funds over great distances.  No matter how adopted those currencies become, this is always true.  On the other hand, Bitcoin middlemen become less and less valuable the more the currency is adopted.
Now, with the question of why a business should start using a Bitcoin middleman to accept payment?
If they are presently using payment providers, why not use one that is cheaper, faster, and has far less risk of chargeback?  I see only upside.
The upside is that one day, if the currency is adopted, the middleman would become useless and therefore the business will never have to pay a fee just to receive funds, as with Bitcoin, no middleman is required.
That's a lot of typing just to make a point to a dip shit.

After you made a recommendation to the readers I wanted to make sure no one actually follows the advice without knowing this very important fact.
As for me, I would never leave funds on any exchange that wasn't fully regulated by some sort of government agency that has the authority to punish the administrators for not following basic rules.  I have always acquired and then quickly gotten funds off the exchanges because I know they have no oversight and are therefore a honey hole for crooks.  At least with other exchanges if someone runs off with your funds you know who to blame (i.e. Mark Karpeles).  If the guys at btc-e run off you don't even know who to go after.  This is even more incentive for them to steal.
@_date: 2014-05-31 02:26:33
I have had a theory on this for a while that I've never posted.  It's a little out there because it takes too much foresighted coordination among politicians that I don't think is likely.
Here it goes:  The US has borrowed lots of dollars from China.  The easiest way to pay this back is to simply monetize the debt (borrow more money from the FED which  simply creates the debt out of nothing).  The problem with that is that it will destroy the country's economy through inflation.  Unless...  A new currency has been adopted that, in effect, has already replaced the dollar.  Then... Screw the Chinese, print all the dollars you want and become debt free.  So if bitcoin replaced the dollar, the US could easily satisfy its debts with a valueless currency. This would also explain the Chinese response to bitcoin.
If the US political officials have this plan in mind, they know it would be executed at the expense of costing the governing the ability to create money at will.  This is a huge cost, but it may be worth it to salvage our situation if we have truly created unsustainable debt.
Now, for the real reason I believe they embrace it:
We're a free nation that still values progress and innovation and our governing won't see the huge threat to the governing until it's too late.  Why does China oppose?  They oppose all innovation that could in any way be deemed as a threat to the party.  This is just our difference.

Forget agreements.  If you give someone a thing to hold for you, now they owe it back to you.  You are a creditor and they are indebted.  When a person can't pay their creditors a bankruptcy proceeding may be sought.  From here the courts now determine how to best satisfy outstanding debts to all creditors.
@_date: 2014-04-26 11:29:28
My Simple Understanding:  they owe some people bitcoin, some fiat, some rent, some salary, some utility bills, etc.  These people that are owed are called creditors.  Mt Gox doesn't have enough $ to pay back all its creditors.  So the courts, instead of picking and choosing who gets what, decides to sell everything Mt Gox has and then divide the proceeds from the sale pro rata amongst their creditors.  
They always liquidate to the currency of that country.  They could liquidate to BTC, but that would be unheard of and kind of absurd at this stage in the life of BTC.

Primarily because of bitcoin I switched to GS3 in Nov. 2012.  I like it more than my Iphones.  Therefore, when my macbook pro broke and I replaced it with an Ubuntu machine.  I am impressed.  My kids now use my iPad.  I'll get an android tablet next and my Mac mini will be replaced by a Samsung smart TV because I only use the mini for plex client on my home theater.  My Plex server now runs on a Linux machine that used to be a hackintosh.  
I can honestly say that their bitcoin hatred was the catalyst that lost them at least one loyal customer.
Spewing hate for them isn't necessary because you don't need them to change.  You can.  Others will too.  As bitcoin grows Apple will either adopt or lose more bitcoiner customers.  Other than the fact that they may slow down adoption a little I know longer have a reason to care what they do.  Problem solved :)

TL;DR You’re a dumbass
My link says this:
“Jury nullification is a discretionary act, and is not a legally sanctioned function of the jury.  It is considered to be inconsistent with the jury's duty to return a verdict based solely on the law and the facts of the case.  The jury does not have a right to nullification, and counsel is not permitted to present the concept of jury nullification to the jury.  However, jury verdicts of acquittal are unassailable even where the verdict is inconsistent with the weight of the evidence and instruction of the law.”
Now if you want to go on being an ignorant fuck, then go right ahead.  Being educated, I happen to know exactly what a discretionary act is.  In fact, I know exactly what it means in law.
In law a discretionary act is one which requires personal deliberation, decision and judgment.  On the other hand, it is a ministerial act when it requires obedience to orders or the performance of a duty to which the person has no choice.  To give an example, a police offer who is on duty working his beat may be performing a discretionary act when he decides to enter into a high speed chase.  On the other hand, if that officer were in the process of transporting a prisoner, he may not have the authority to even engage, because he is performing a ministerial act.  One reason it is important to understand the difference between the two is to apply the doctrine of official immunity.  Official immunity is an affirmative defense found in law to protect government employees from liability when they are performing a discretionary duty, in good faith, that is within the scope of their employment.
Now you are obviously ignorant in the fact that you think that a discretionary act means that a person can perform the act in whatever manner they choose.  It doesn't.  It usually comes with a good faith standard.  For instance, a police officer can't just engage in a high speed chase, a discretionary act, because they feel like it, and still claim official immunity.  They must also show that they performed their duty in good faith.  This means that the officer must show that they weighed the necessity against the risk and determined that the chase was necessary in a way that a reasonable officer could have.  Now the question is what is reasonable?  And now we get to the purpose of a jury.  Their job is to find facts.  They determine what is "reasonable" in this instance.  Their job is not to nullify law.  If they do so, they are not performing their discretionary duty in good faith.  Just because they may have the discretion to do so, does not mean that it is they purpose for them to do so.  Likewise, it is not the purpose of a police officer to go flying through a residential neighborhood during rush hour on a rainy day to catch a person who was not wearing their seatbelt.  In both instances the act is discretionary.
Nullification occurs when a juror violates his or her oath by failing to apply the law as instructed by the court thereby acquitting a defendant even though the government has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  1 Fed. Jury Prac. &amp; Instr. § 5:16 (6th ed.), 1 Fed. Jury Prac. &amp; Instr. § 5:16 (6th ed.)
In People v. Kriho, the trial court held a juror in contempt after he advocated jury nullification to another juror.  People v. Kriho, 996 P.2d 158 (Colo. Ct. App. 1999).  In 2000, The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit approved striking a potential juror because of his assertion that a criminal jury always has the power to acquit.  United States v. James, No. 98-1479, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 1738, at *6 (10th Cir. Feb. 7, 2000).
Not only is it obvious as fuck that it is clearly not the purpose of the American juror to circumvent the law, it is also well established law.  Jurors even go to jail for trying to do this.

I don't know that an ice age won't come next year.  I still stand by my prediction that this summer will be warmer than this winter although I recognize that it could be wrong.   What is sillier, assuming that a well established pattern will repeat or that it will suddenly stop?  From what I am reading from you, it is just as reasonable for someone to arbitrarily say that this summer will be colder than winter.
I'll make the concession that anything is possible with regard to Bitcoin prices.  I'll also concede that prices going to $0 is plausible.  However, I am (and you are) forced to decide what to do with regard to investing in Bitcoin.  There is no way around this.  I can either be in or out or short.  I choose to be in because I think the pattern will likely repeat.  The level of certainty I have is reflected in how large a position I take.  If I were betting on summer being warmer than winter my position would be larger.
If you choose to be out you are betting against the pattern.  If you are very certain, then you should take a short position on bitfinex (you know make a little easy money).
What are you going to do?  Is summer going to be warm?
For me to answer this question it helps to have charts like OP posted.

I really do appreciate you and others taking the time to understand difficult topics.  I do have to say though, that I don't think Satoshi's point for the currency was simply to incentivize hashing, but on the contrary, the reason for incentivizing the hashing is to protect the currency. 
The blockchain was invented so that the currency of Bitcoin could survive, not the other way around.  Satoshi's intention was to create a global currency/payment network that needs no 3rd party in order to exist and function.
With that said, your practice of taking a different perspective is a great way of causing brilliant ideas to form.  And your understanding of the technical idea of bitcoin is impressive.  You guys who are looking to use the blockchain in other ways seem to be recognizing a value that was even bigger than what Satoshi seems to have had in mind when he created it.

Quite accurate interpretation.  When you hand your money to a bank, it is no longer yours, it is now theirs (to invest).  That balance you see online is not how much you have in the bank, it's how much is owed to you by the bank "on demand".  Depositors at a bank are actually a liability on the banks books, which is why they "credit" (instead of debit) your account when you make a deposit.  This means depositors are actually creditors to the bank.  This is why banks are so heavily regulated with what they can do with deposited funds.
I don't see why Mt Gox would be treated any differently.  This is why there needs to be regulation (whether government, or very transparent self-regulation) at the exchange level.

What do you mean by non-symmetrical logarithmic scale?  Do you just mean logarithmic scales are non-symmetrical or is this one somehow different than others?
To me it looks like a normal log scale.  It goes from 1 to 2, and instead of marking 4 it goes up a little higher and marks 5, then 10.  At 10 it repeats the doubling pattern of 10, 20 (instead of marking 40 it moves up to 50) and so on.
I can't really think of a better way to charts bitcoins growth than with a log chart, as it appears its adoption grows exponentially, and it appears its price has been correlated to adoption.

Thank you very much for this.  It always shocks me and makes me happy when I get a tip.
I've been a supporter of and extremely intrigued by Bitcoin since I first heard about it in 2012.  I have been holding since that time and I can not believe how far it has come within that time.  When I got in, I thought it was a crazy pipe dream that hoped would succeed and therefore "invested."  Now I just think that as long as it doesn't "break," then it is destined to succeed.  Your tip gives me hope and excitement about how the technology will continue to be adopted in the years to come.  It's much appreciated.
Thank you again and Happy Holidays!

You need to recognize that some things are out of your control.  With that said, your most likely bet is bitcoinstore.com and some restaurant in Miami I saw today on reddit.  Nonetheless, once you pass on your coins, the new owner is free to do as he/she wishes.  
From what I understand, processors like bitpay and Coinbase allow merchants to choose the percentage of bitcoin to convert.  Also, I believe that overstock has suggested that they may be keeping some bitcoin.  In my opinion this is a risk that should be taken by individual shareholders and not the company itself.  Their CEO has a stash of coins.  No need to force shareholders to speculate on currency just to invest in online retail.  My guess is that overstock's holding is miniscule and for operational purposes.

I would hate to live in a world where I can't have privacy.  It's a fundamental right as a human.  I mean this in all honesty and not as a troll.  My privacy is very important to me even when I don't have anything in particular to hide.  It's the reason I where pants.  I don't want my financial records,  medical records, travelling records, communications, etc. on display to anyone else without my consent.
I especially don't like the idea of me not having privacy, but those elected into power having secrets.  Too much power.  Knowing human nature eventually someone in power will abuse it and ruin yhe utopia you've described and make life far worse than it was when we all had privacy.  History is full of this sort of abuse of power.  Take privacy away and take freedom away.
I do agree that governments are moving towards tracking each citizen.  I do fear that Bitcoin could eventually help them.  I would love to see mixing as part of the protocol.  The powers that be don't seem to agree with me.

Bitcoin has had a short life certainly not "ages" worth.  Also, DF seems to be growing pretty quickly.  As far as empirical evidence goes, I believe we saw what happens when 51% of the mining power goes to one entity with the collapse of terracoin.  It killed it.

I was primarily shocked that they were giving some effort in 1996.  Bitcoin was out 12 years later and could have began with the 1996 paper as an outline and could have resulted after much more consideration.  The thing that struck me about the paper vs. Bitcoin is that it seemed the NSA wanted a currency that they could control while Bitcoin seems like an option that they would not have liked because of its decentralized pseudonymous nature.  I always wondered if Satoshi Nakamoto is someone(s) who worked closely with the NSA but released a project that was counter what the NSA would have liked.
This is just something I wonder about.  I never get carried away with it because I know there's no real use to it and I will never have evidence anyway.  The mysterious origin of bitcoin is fascinating though.

That's like saying email will become valuable once there is a way to invest in the technology underlying email, except email became very valuable without this possibility.

I've heard that bitpay provides the option to keep a percentage of your sales in bitcoin and that some merchants do this.
With regard to your point though.  This seems like Bitpay has provided a service that helps to solve a kindof chicken/egg problem with regard to bitcoin adoption.  It allows for partial adoption for merchants without taking the volatility risk that deters them.  At the same time there may be consumers who are more encouraged to own a currency if they can actually purchase things with it.  So it seems conceivable to me that merchant adoption (with or without bitpay) could encourage consumer adoption which would in turn encourage more merchant adoption possibly creating a positive feedback loop.  Now this adoption seems like it could lead to an increased demand for the currency which would necessarily raise its price.  An increase in price would make it so that more wealth is required in order to move the same amount of supply of bitcoin.  Because more wealth is required it would seem that volatility might then decrease in bitcoin.  As volatility decreases merchants may find it less risky to hold some of the currency.  This sort of adoption pattern could play out to a point where bitcoin becomes so widely used (as a store of value and a means of exchange) that volatility reaches a point where the service that Bitpay is currently offering is no longer desired.
Will it play out this way?  I have no clue how it will all actually play out, but I can't see how Bitpay merchant adoption is anything but good for bitcoin adoption as a whole even if for now they are merely converting to fiat.
Do you agree?

It's only hard because it takes a lot of words to teach people how market psychology works, but ultimately early adopters will "sell down" as the value rises.  Everyone knows and can sense that it is stupid to "place all your eggs in one basket."  People who currently have 20% of their current portfolio tied up in Bitcoin would have &gt;70% if Bitcoin's value increased 10-fold.  Those people get used to the idea of being wealthier.  The market starts gyrating and they get scared (rightfully) and then diversify.  Rinse and repeat until you have a fully adopted highly valued currency.
When people read this, it sounds like a guarantee and therefore begs the question, why not just continue to hold.  This question comes from a lack of empathy regarding the true sense of risk that people will feel.  I've stated a path, but ultimately that path is an uncertainty.  Bitcoin can always fail, and the more value a person has tied up in it, the more risk they feel when forced to consider that possibility.  Most of those people will diversify, and rightfully, because it is stupid to take on that much risk.  Ultimately, while early adopters will reap large rewards for their risk (assuming it plays out), they won't be able to buy half the world.

Bitcoin has two uses, means of exchange and store of value.  In order for it to function as a means of exchange it must first function as a store of value, but not vice versa.  As bitcoin grows as a store of value it is having its usage increased.  Although I agree that I would like to see more businesses accept bitcoin I also celebrate its growth as a store of value and don't see that as much more speculative than using precious metals as a store of value.
@_date: 2014-11-25 01:13:43
I'll start with a definition:
[ih-kwiv-uh-key-shuh n]
1.  the use of equivocal or ambiguous expressions, especially in order to mislead or hedge; prevarication.
2.  an equivocal, ambiguous expression; equivoque:
The speech was marked by elaborate equivocations.
3.  Logic. a fallacy caused by the double meaning of a word.
Your two contradictory statements:
“a bitcoin can only exist as a transaction.”
“There is no bitcoin, only a record of transactions . . . .”
You say “a bitcoin can only exist as a transaction.”  This is not technically a false statement, but it seemed poorly worded in a way that could lead to misunderstanding.  A better way to word what you are saying maybe through the words of Satoshi: “an electronic coin [is] a chain of digital signatures.”  Because your statement struck me as misleading (whether intentional or not), I asked you a question to have you clarify the meaning you were intending to convey.  Your response is where the equivocation became clear.  You said, “There is no Bitcoin, only a record of transactions that contain values forwarded to them.”  If Bitcoin is a chain of digital signatures, how can you say there is not Bitcoin?  Surely you didn't intend to say that there is no bitcoin, only bitcoin.  The only way I can understand what you are trying to say is if you are mixing definitions.
As you can see under definition number 3, an equivocation can exist when there are multiple meanings to one word and mixing definitions lead to a fallacy.  It is true that you and Satoshi and I agree that a bitcoin is a “chain of digital signatures.”  It needs to be understood that this is only one definition, a technical definition.  Using only the technical definition, you obviously wouldn't have meant to way that bitcoins exist and then say that they don't (this is absurd).  So, I have to conclude that you must have been mixing the technical definition with a practical definition of bitcoin, “a single unit of currency.”
[bit-koin] 
 
noun 
1. (often initial capital letter) a digital currency that uses state-of-the-art cryptography, can be issued in any fractional denomination, and has a decentralized distribution system: 
2. a single unit of this currency: 
So what you must have been saying is something like,“there is no [single unit of currency], only a record of transactions,” mixing definitions, or in other words, there is no practical bitcoin, just a technical bitcoin.  Do you see the absurdity in this--If there is no practical bitcoin, then what is the point?
The reasonable inference to make is that there is a practical bitcoin, because there is a technical bitcoin.  That was the whole point of Satoshi creating bitcoin:
A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution.
Do you see now how what you've done is equivocate?  You've come to a useless and absurd conclusion by mixing definitions.
I applaud you on the level of understanding you've gained about Bitcoin and it's inter-workings.  I don't doubt that you know more about Bitcoin than me.
@_date: 2014-01-08 05:30:53
I think I figured out your point.  Let me know if this is right:
Bitpay's growth as a service really doesn't reflect on bitcoin adoption because most bitpay merchants just immediately convert to real money because they don't want bitcoins and bitcoin adoption isn't really taking place unless people and business actually want to hold bitcoins for future exchanges.
Would that sum it up entirely or am I missing something?

I will concede.  In that case, Bitmain will mine SegWit.

The last thing the PBoC wants is more privacy in Bitcoin.  Accordingly, I can't see them allowing it.  Not that I think the scenario you are proposing is likely, or even plausible.

Easy.  Bitcoin is already on a strong path for adoption as a means of exchange.  I personally would like to see it grow in adoption as a store of value.  In order for this to happen people need to take their wealth out of dollars/pm/equities/etc. and put it into bitcoin.  Right now that's pretty risky.  However, strong regulation on exchanges, leading to trustworthy exchanges led by professionals, will go far to reducing said risk.  This will in turn lead to more big money adoption as a store of value.
@_date: 2017-02-14 16:03:12


Perhaps??  It seems to me that Satoshi was not infallible.  He made mistakes.  And it turns out that the "trustless" portion of "cash" quickly gets deteriorated when attempting to scale by simply increasing the maximum size limit of a block of transactions.
Not a huge deal.  He still created what seems destined to be the greatest invention of our century--a global trustless value-transfer system that provides complete financial sovereignty to its users.  But it will take additional development to make it scale without deteriorating the very properties that make it revolutionary.  There seems quite a bit of promise.  Although, maybe not with "Bitcoin" proper.

He decided to invent a spray that makes dog poop vaporize (Va-poo-rize).  To him, the idea of the invention was the invention.  Wouldn't it be marvelous if we could end world hunger?  Systems can do that!!!  Booyah!

What the fuck would be the point of running your own blockchain?  If it's your own, then just set up a centralized server and save yourself the trouble.  If you're going to run a service on a blockchain, the only reason to do it is because it's secured from being arbitrarily changed by human intervention.  It's only secure because a fuckton of computing power has been dedicated to maintaining that blockchain by a bunch of decentralized strangers who are seeking an independent reward for providing the computing power.
So again, what other blockchain could Nasdaq be planning to run on that satisfies the necessary prerequisite of being maintained in a highly secure and decentralized manner?
To set this bullshit straight, a blockchain is not valuable unless the currency that is provided as a reward for its maintenance has value.  While Bitcoin is able to exist because of blockchain technology, "the blockchain" has no value without Bitcoin itself having value.  Nonetheless, Bitcoin would lose its value almost instantly if ever "the blockchain" lost its decentralized security.
Accordingly, if Nasdaq is planning to run on a blockchain, it has to be a secure one.  Otherwise, someone will dump a little hash power on the system and fuck them up.  On the other hand, Nasdaq could create a closed system, but if someone can't dump hash power, then it's just another centralized server masquerading as a blockchain, which provides no extra value, and is useless beyond measure, compared to a central server that can do the same thing faster and better.
I guess Nasdaq could decide to create an altcoin (compete with Bitcoin), and push it until it has enough value an hash power to securely support their service.  But why?  The odds of success for that coin are very low, and next to nothing if they premined.  Therefore, without the premine, all they would have created is another Bitcoin, which they have no vested interest in.  In several years, with a lot of luck, this theoretical coin would allow them to do the exact same thing they could have already done with Bitcoin's blockchain right now.
TL;DR they have to be planning to use the Bitcoin Blockchain.

I'm with you.  I haven't been able to think of a way, but I haven't dismissed the possibility of having a blockchain without a currency.  
What if a group of governments or organizations agreed to fund percentages of mining.   Say no more than 10% for any one entity.  Mining could only be done by invited entities. This wouldn't be a trustless system, but a trust minimized system.
That's all I can come up with so far.  It's not very good.

If Bitcoin does not have sufficient properties as a store of value, then why do you say that it should maintain a market cap of $35million?  It seems bizarre (just bizarre) to maintain these two conclusions at the same time.

No it's not.  That's just a conclusory premise unsupported by reality that misleads you to a false conclusion.


There is no "real money," but in the minds of most, this idea is extremely foreign.  Part of the adoption of Bitcoin includes the human tendency to identify things in this manner.  While there is technically no "real Bitcoin," emotionally, there most certainly is, and it's the one that has consensus.
I don't disagree with you that a POW change is difficult, but only because of the difficulty in garnering consensus for such a change.  If such is present and readily apparent, the change is trivial (although the "best" change could be a difficult, endlessly bike-shedded decision).  The only way I see actually garnering such consensus is if an ASIC manufacturer becomes bent on co-opting Bitcoin.  We seem to be in the early stages of the formation of "consensus."  There is still a long way to go.

However, before you said


That’s beyond assuming.
My point: 
You are making the argument that you should reject the super-majority when they are making a wrong decision.  In order to illustrate your point, you concoct a scenario that is absurd enough that even you can't adhere to it.  That is to say, you would assume—in fact, insist—that OP would have to be in the tiny minority, although the odds of that are clearly only 1 in 5.  The reason for your inconsistency lies in the absurdity of your scenario—that a super-majority, vested in Bitcoin, would agree to changes that would obviously destroy Bitcoin.  The moral of the story: it’s right to go against the majority when they agree to something obviously absurd.
The problem is that that is a useless proverb; no one relies on majorities or super-majorities to make decisions a choice would be obviously absurd.  We rely on majorities/super-majorities when decisions are not so clear, and most commonly when more than one answer could work. 
In the scenario at hand, when you are talking to OP, or anyone else, you will assume that they are in the 80%.  This is because the 80% is not agreeing to something obviously absurd.  They are agreeing on a choice for the path of Bitcoin.  It could go two different ways, and neither is exactly absurd (although your path seems pretty damn absurd, but arguendo I’ll say it’s not).  With that said, this is exactly the right scenario for relying on majorities or super-majorities—to make a choice over less than obvious decisions.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for the concept of “binding yourself to the mast” and creating a counter-majoritarian difficulty, when appropriate.  It’s good to have some principles that never change and some that only change through serious deliberation during times that aren’t trying.  However, we are not in a trying time.  And no one wants to break some fundamental principle (i.e. stealing money or inflating the currency).  In fact, people are simply looking to make a change to the protocol to support more of the same usage.  There are mostly pros to doing so.  We are not in the midst of an emergency where cooler heads cannot prevail.  We are not in a scenario where the poor are trying to loot the rich.  Moreover, we are not in a scenario where anyone is trying to change the core principles of the currency.  All that is being proposed is to increase an arbitrary cap on usage.  And just like all other changes to the protocol, if well vetted, it should go through at the will of the majority (miners/nodes/etc.). 
If you are standing on some ideological principle that you are heroically saving the majority from themselves, you need to re-evaluate your reasoning to make sure it’s appropriate, because your analogy is unfitting.  This is clearly not a time for extolling the virtues of counter-majoritarianism.  That shit should be reserved for when there is a moral problem, or some actual impending doom.  With that said, if you know of some impending doom, then please, rather than speaking in riddled parables of the 80% stealing the wealth, articulate the problem concisely and change our minds.  But all I’ve seen from your camp is simply a disagreement over the vision for Bitcoin.

The way I have always seen the volatility problem being solved is actually quite simple.  Assuming a price of $800, Right now $1mm could purchase 1250 BTC or roughly 0.01% of the total currency in existence.  If the price were $8000 then the same amount of wealth would purchase 0.001% of the total currency in existence.
As adoption takes place the price rises and as the price rises it requires increasingly more wealth to move the markets thereby making the markets more stable.  
With massive adoption the price rises, therefore stability rises, to a level where stability of other currencies is measured by how many bitcoins (with an unmanipulated supply) it can purchase, not the other way around.
All of this of course takes time and adoption.  Upward price movements based on hype rather than adoption do not create the stability.

If it's the best proposal in the world, I'm good with it.  It's commonplace for "public servants" to leave office and become consultants as experts in the field they helped regulate.  If the public wanted to stop this, we could match bids with the private sector.  Usually government workers (even higher ups) make a bit less than they would in private sector.

No.  Of course not.  To control the Bitcoin protocol, one simply needs to control mining and control major exchanges.


The PBoC just co-opted all the exchanges within their jurisdiction.  It seems they are likely to implement a mandatory custodianship.  Accordingly, they are now the key holders for many Bitcoins and they get to determine what options their market is presented with for what is "Bitcoin."  They are not going to allow these exchanges to support SegWit.
The Chinese authorities have Bitcoin.  No matter what the rest of the world wants to do--including the Chinese population--there is nothing we can do to kill their chain.  We can't "fire the miners."  Any attempt will result in a true chain split, and the Chinese population will not, in large volume, be able to participate in the spinoff.  They will be stuck with the Bitcoin that their authorities tell them is "Bitcoin."  Ironically, it will be the "Bitcoin" that presently is.  In other words, if we attempt to stop them (algo change), we will be the ones creating what Luke-jr calls an altcoin.

Probably good for price, but horrible for Bitcoin.  It's good for price, because PBOC is likely to implicitly invite their population to store wealth in Bitcoin.  At the same time, however, the PBOC is likely to prevent their population from actually holding large quantities of Bitcoin purchased through exchanges.  And if there is a fork, the PBOC will limit the choices their market has for which chain is actually "Bitcoin."  And for all the reasons we recognize that SegWit is better (it protects decentralization, leads to privacy and fungibility, etc.), the PBOC will recognize the alternatives as better for their wishes.  So the larger portion of the Chinese market will be forced onto a chain that "scales" in the manner that Bitmain (the Chinese company that has monopolized ASIC manufacturing) desires.  A manner that leads to complete control of Bitcoin by government.  And there is no way to kill that chain.
@_date: 2017-02-26 13:36:19
Jihan would probably love to not have to decide.
@_date: 2017-02-16 15:01:29
You and I share the same career path, although, I have no experience with Chinese AML.  I see an alternative to forced closure--forced custodianship.  It is quite possible that the PBoC is planning to become a mandatory "BitGo" of sorts for all of the exchanges.  No withdrawals would be allowed without their consent.  This maneuver would prevent Bitcoin trade and investment from being driven underground where it is further outside of their control.  The "legitimate" investors/traders could still buy and sell Bitcoin, but now with the safety and blessing of their authorities.
If the PBoC decides to keep looser reigns, they would still allowed monitored withdrawals (my suspicion).  But if they choose to grip tighter reigns, they could allow ownership only by custody.  For those looking to speculate through trading, either of these is good news.  For those looking to hold as a store of wealth (like gold), this could be good news.  But for those looking to move large amounts of capital outside of China, it's game over (except through risky underground markets).
I suspect all of this is part of a larger plan to capitalize on their unique position to co-opt Bitcoin entirely and bring its governance under their control.  See this short tweet.

The value of the coin is based on supply and demand.  The security of the ledger is based on how many people mine it (arbitrary hash rate of strangers seeking reward).  The demand for the coin will cease without this security.  So the value is tied to a this security, although in theory land supply and demand are separate from the hash rate.
But to the more important point.  Any ledger controlled by a few may as well be a copy of quickbooks.  It's equally infallible.  What makes "the" blockchain more infallible is the fact that it is not controlled by a few, but a number so high, that it is practically impossible to corral enough users to actually change the chain.  That's infallibility.  A meddle proof ledger.  If the banks create some exclusive blockchain they have nothing but but a copy of quickbooks.  What's the point?  This fixes nothing.  If Nasdaq creates an open system that they don't premine or control (two prerequisites to attracting users) then they've just attempted to recreate Bitcoin.  For what reason?  So they can do the exact same thing that Bitcoin already allows?
You need to sit down for a while with your thinking cap on and figure out where Bitcoin's value truly lies.  Start with the with the question:  how could I fuck Bitcoin up?  Write down every idea you have.  Then keep going until you realize that none of them work.  Then... Start over with the same list on Nascoin and see how many remain un-stricken.  If even only one remains viable, the coin sucks.

If you are going to quote, here is what Core says
1.6 MB if filled with 100% P2PKH transactions.  That's the absolute lowest possible cap increase that is effective immediately.
It's higher if people are using P2SH transactions (which most will because their wallets will do it for them).
It's 2MB if using 2 of 2 multisig (again many are expected to start doing this for 2-factor authentication).
Other configurations would make it even higher.

Everybody (everybody who matters) sees that extra capacity would be nice.  But it takes a naive myopic viewpoint to consider only one's wishes.  Adding scale in the simple-minded manner of just raising the cap comes at a certain cost to decentralization and a huge risk to market destabilization.  Those things also affect the ability to "change the world."  In fact, if Bitcoin becomes governable, it has no ability to change the world.
Right now there are meetings (that you are not invited to) where decisions about Bitcoin are made.  However, because everyone can run a node, any decision made at those meetings must be palatable to the ordinary user.  But once nodes are too costly, that's over.  Ordinary users won't even be able to fork an algo change to start solo mining--Bitcoin is out of the hands of its users.
Right now Bitcoin is almost governable by regulating about 20 exchanges and 20 mining pools.  It's holding on by a thread.  Take nodes away and it's over.  It will eventually be controlled by the rule of a few men--fiat.

All proof of work is functional at scale, even SHA256.


Practically any POW change would move hash power from the current leaders.  Moreover, the current leaders would be crushed by being saddled with debt secured by machines that are good for nothing but performing meaningless SHA256 hashes.


Any can secure the network as long as it begins a new arms race.


Accordingly, many POW are suitable for a Bitcoin (or any) blockchain.
The only difficult part of an algo change is the requisite consensus to perform one without a huge market disruption.  But if this is present, the code changes are relatively trivial.  And there are many options.  There's nothing that special about SHA256.

Maybe in another case (just some guy who doesn't like the government) that's far fetched.
IN THIS CASE...
We have someone convicted, on a guilty plea, of selling explosives, who is no longer allowed into the country.  In his explanation of his position on his website, he doesn't tell the truth, and claims that he was the only person prosecuted for this.  I found others--one who used the same item to make IED's.  This isn't his only falsehood.  He persuaded many to trust Mt. Gox, by making misleading statements.  He later apologized for that (another guilty plea with an explanation).
So I have to choose to believe that either the government has it out for him, which is far fetched enough, or believe that there is more to the story than he is sharing.  What is really far fetched is to just believe him--Believe the convicted felon, who's banned from the country, and who has shown a propensity for dishonesty, when he gives us the story that instead of him actually being in the wrong, that he was targeted by the government.
Given his lack of adherence to honesty, I can't believe him, no matter how hard I try.  Neither can you.  You're just saying you do--for some reason, probably political.  That's we can't see eye to eye on this.

Well...  The white paper said that the longest chain should prevail.  And in the first iteration of Bitcoin, this was coded.  Then after realizing this was a huge mistake, the code was made that determining which chain was valid would be done by following the chain with the most work, rather than the chain that was simply longer.

**OMG! OMG! PANICCKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!**
It's relatively cheap and easy to fill the mempool (thereby taking up any headroom that would otherwise be available in any given block).  It's quite expensive, on the other hand, to actually cause fees to materially rise.
Presently, when people flood the mempool it's not publicized.  But when they first began to do so ("stress test") it was made very public as an attempt to force XT on everyone.
See 
They attempted to prove that a cap increase was desperately needed.  However, what they actually proved was that by raising your fee slightly, it would make their attack too expensive to actually harm the functionality of the network.  **The blocks being full is meaningless if it's not causing fees to materially rise.**  Anyone can inexpensively generate lots of low fee transactions that will take up the remaining space in blocks after transactions with already low, but reasonable fees, are in the block.

It is a negative tone/perspective.  Nonetheless factually true.

Instead of frying your brain on whatever it is you take into your system,  maybe try doing the most basic research on criminal law. 
For most crimes (ones with serious punishments) there is not only a requirement for a wrongful act, but also a requirement for a guilty mind (culpability).  It is to be seen if Ross had both, but there is no way the USPS had culpability if they were simply operating in their normal capacity.

Are you trying to get brownie political points as the calm voice of reason?
It's not very reasonable.  Return the funds and cancel the speech.  If Moe didn't know that he was a con man when he scheduled, then next time be more diligent.   Nonetheless, he knows now, and he needs to make the right decision.  The fact that he was paid you just makes him a complicit sell-out, unless of course... he returns the money, and cancels the speech.  Then he will be the noble warrior who found himself tricked into a bad situation but chose the high road even at his own expense.  He will be loved.

That's acceptable.  If Moe doesn't know it's a scam, then I can see his decision being more difficult.  He may need to educate himself, then cancel.  Even without that, this seems like a good case for avoiding even the appearance of impropriety.
We all know that he hasn't been put before a jury, but that's not necessary to cancel him as a speaker.  We don't "know" that Bill Cosby drugged and raped a bunch of women, but TV Land won't air old re-runs of his show.  It's not that hard logically to conclude to cancel.  It's just hard politically, and possibly financially.

I'm not so sure.  In the very short term they won't.  But right now I think there is a lot of money on the sidelines waiting for this to blow over.  China banning Bitcoin exchanges has been clouding the market for a while.  If they finally do it it will remove a huge amount of uncertainty.  It all depends on how much wealth (not volume) the Chinese have actually sunk into this market.
My suspicion is that Chinese wealth that Bitcoin loses is less than that sitting on the sidelines in the rest of the world waiting for this to be over with.
Of course I might be wrong again and lose.

So you're suggesting that the explosives were more like "black cats" or "sparklers" and less like dynamite and that the prosecutor wanted to put someone away, so the prosecutor got Ver to plead guilty to selling "explosives" (because it sounds worse) and then persuaded the court to put him away for a 10 month sentence???
Why did they do this?
The perspective behind my post is this:
I have no idea what the facts are.  I just remembered reading (a long time ago) that he was a convicted felon, so I googled it this morning and read nothing more than the two links I posted, thinking that this may have more to do with the reason that they don't want to let him in the country.  It seemed to make more sense to me, and the lawyer then confirmed that it could very well be a justifiable reason.
I never really intended to question the validity of the conviction, just to suggest a more understandable the reason that he may be denied entry.
But back to your point:
I'm open to having convincing facts persuade me that the conviction was unjustified.  I would, in fact, like to believe that is was unjustified.  However, I must say, the meaning I infer from your statement makes you seem a little more than eccentric.  Please clarify yourself and explain how it is the government that has exagerated in calling them "explosives," and not his supporters who are exagerating in calling them "fireworks."  I'm open minded on this.

I think I get it.  You want to see Segwit implemented in a different way that removes some negative implications.  You want to see that happen after or at the same time as a cap increase in a hard fork.
But my question is this: If you are not getting your way on the implementation of Segwit, and instead it is implemented through a softfork, wouldn't an additional 0.25-0.625 MB cap increase satisfy the need that you think will be urgent in a few months?  Wouldn't this satisfy the needs for a "first increase"?  I can't see how it would not.

You say:
"While everyone else, including the manufacturer, were simply asked to stop selling them I became the only person in the nation to be prosecuted."
However, here is a guy who was prosecuted and convicted by a jury.
Kenneth Shearer, in 2002 for selling the PCR 2000.
In another instance, a conviction was given for mere possession.
United States v. Jackman, 72 Fed. Appx. 862 (3d Cir. 2003)
The thing is... He wasn't merely in possession, he had altered it.  Apparently, it is was not too difficult to convert these into IED's, which he had done.
Given your political persuasion, and your disdain for government, it doesn't seem like too far a stretch to believe that maybe you were selling these to people in order to aid in destruction rather than "pest control" remedies.  I mean, you don't really seem like the type of guy who is interested in farming and what not.  And given that there are so many ways to make a buck... Why this?

Nonetheless, Overstock is down substantially on that 10% they keep.  It seems hyperbolic of him to say "heavy price," but still they would presently be better off if they had accepted 100% in USD and held none.  At least on paper.  It could have hurt sales.  I know I've bought from them simply because of their pro Bitcoin stance.

This is Bitcoin's killer app.  This is why I bought in 2012 and why I still hold today.  We don't really need a new VISA or Paypal.  We do really need digital gold outside the purview of government.  The more transactions, the better.  But that cannot come at a detrimental cost to Bitcoin's tamper-resistant nature.  If Bitcoin maintains tamper-resistance, transaction scaling can be achieved through numerous solutions.  But if Bitcoin loses tamper-resistance, then it no longer can attract Big Wealth as a "safe" asset.  Scaling transactions becomes futile at this point.

Immutability should refer more generally to Bitcoin's behavior.  The blockchain is only secure when Bitcoin's behavior is immutable.  Then, more specifically, the type of behavior that should be unchanging is the "consensus rules."  It should be practically impossible to change them.

If I want to save money, and I have a choice, am I better off saving in a deflationary currency or an inflationary currency?   When answering this (possibly for yourself), keep in mind that what I do doesn't affect what the rest of the world does, it's just an individual decision. 
Even if what you are suggesting for is "better" for the whole, if it's worse for the individual then how will it survive without enforeable legal mandate?  The idea is something similar to a tragedy of the commons.

At $500k many people will be getting paid in BTC.  They won't need to sell it, because they buy things with it.  The people they buy things from with it won't sell it, because they pay their bills and employees with it.
It will be a closed loop self-sustainable system.
The people who are presently holding 1000's of coins will have long since diversified much of their huge portfolios into other assets, spreading the currency around in exchange for riches.

It sounds deep and sophisticated to say that you like the blockchain,  but not bitcoin.  Unless they are just a repeater, like this guy seems to be, it's really just an end around for saving face.  Only a year ago these people used Bitcoin as a punchline.   But it's shown so much viability that if they don't start to acquiesce then they'll risk losing credibility.   So they are faced with a problem:  How can I appear to remain consistent even though I am changing my stance on Bitcoin?
AH HAH!!!!  Solution:
"I don't like Bitcoin, I like the blockchain, that bitcoin just so happens to run on."  That works!  
Next they'll be saying, as though it required great illumination,  "the Blockchain is one of the greatest inventions ever, but it only works if people find value in the currency used to reward miners.  People could have chosen any currency, it's not that Bitcoin is special, just that it was first to the market so that it is winning."
Then they will have come all the way around to supporting Bitcoin, while on the surface remaining true to their earlier musings.  Eventually enough time will pass that they will feel that everyone has forgotten their initial stance, then they'll drop the charade. 
Whatever...  I'm glad to see them come around, although I'd love to see them have to eat humble pie as well.  Oh well.

With the correct algo selection (perhaps even a rotation), the POW arms race would simply begin anew, but with a precedent set for what happens to a manufacturer that actually devotes the resources to cornering the market.  It doesn't take much to secure the network, and the amount of time it would take to amass the hash power to harm it should also allow for others to amass the power to defeat such attempts.
We used to have to worry about a 51% attack because a single pool would obtain the political power through the acquiescence of many miners.  Now we must be concerned with an even greater threat: a hardware manufacturer cornering the market and single-handedly controlling &gt;51% of the hash rate.  This is presently happening.  Worse, using anti-competitive measures, they are able to crush competitors in ways that run afoul to the anti-trust legislation of most western states.
The model was once used by Walmart.  The retail giant would enter a small town and sell their products at a loss for long enough to outlast their smaller competitors.  Then once their competitors collapse, they would raise prices.  Their vast amount of capital allowed them to easily endure the losses in order to reap the long-term rewards of a retail monopoly in the area.  This practice is illegal in the U.S., but the same is now occurring in the ASIC manufacturing world.  As the saying goes, "pigs get fat and hogs get slaughtered."  I pretty much agree with you that a hard fork to a POW change is almost impossible to accomplish.  But this is only because it is difficult to get the entire market to consent and to realize that they all consent.  If an ASIC manufacturer gets too aggressive, I can see that leading to the requisite "consensus."

The Bitcoin we know has been co-opted by a sovereign state.  And they are going to keep control of it.  One option is to "spinoff."  We could even call the spinoff "Bitcoin."  But by objective technical measures, it will be something different, because China now controls Bitcoin.

First.  What is the "title-text" you are referring to?
Second.  The method you're linking to was what I was referring to (and advocating) two paragraphs down from where you quoted.  If the Gox thief is caught then use coercion (maybe not a wrench, but longer prison sentence) to get the funds back.  The traditional method still works.  I'd prefer that over a central authority being able to control all funds.
Third.  Of course the government (as if it is a living thing with a mind, and not a collection of different people) doesn't care about average joe.  Average Joes submit.  However, some in government would love to hammer fuck the hell out of Snowden though.  He didn't comply.  Snowden can't conduct financial transactions through our mainstream system.  He's been cut off.  I would like Bitcoin to remain resistant to this (no central authority).  Like paper money.  Whoever holds it can spend it and it can only be taken by force or theft.

Shackled attempts to scale Bitcoin will relegate it to both a poor store of value and a poor means of exchange.  Unshackled, it can be great for both.

Nope, I understood what you were saying (It's not that subtly nuanced).  You're just wrong.  Legal advice can come from anywhere.

Everyone does actually.
In order to say that you weren't giving legal advice, you are merely narrowing the meaning of a term to mean less than its complete meaning.

The same mathematical "impossibility" applies to hard forks.  The ability to hard fork proves the mathematic ability to alter the blockchain.  In fact, the blockchain can be altered with only 51% of the hash power.  It's well documented as a 51% attack.  You should look it up.  In order for Bitcoin to be secure, these type changes must be practically impossible.  All the "fighting" helps assure that immutability is secure.

Maybe so, but they are in desperate need of a quick 19k coins and acquiring them could move the market significantly (especially if we all know they are doing it and therefore hold).  That movement could cost them more than the equity stake is worth to them.  Therefore, the person already holding the coins may be able to pick up the stake for better terms than if Bitstamp wasn't in desperate times.  Kindof a meet-in-the middle sort of deal.

Bitcoin has to be a store of wealth BEFORE it can be anything else.
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:23:55
So something like this?
For each hot wallet:
Bitstamp has two sets of keys and Bitgo has one.  Bitstamp will keep one key offline, but the other will be for "operational" purposes.  Any time a withdrawal request is made Bitstamp and Bitgo will be required to sign the transaction under normal circumstances.  However, if there is a problem getting one of the entities to sign, then Bitstamp can resort to the "non-operational" key to get the required 2 of 3 signatures to move the coins.
The end user will never be required to sign a transaction and services will function in the exact same way for them.  
The security increase is behind the scenes, being that two signatures are required from two different entities to be able to withdraw from the hot wallet under normal operations.

You said it should be worth 100x less, why shouldn't it be worth $0, or 100x more?


WTF are you talking about?  What is the primary goal?  I am guessing you mean a medium of exchange, but you write like meth head (no clear thoughts).  If you meant that being medium of exchange is the primary goal, you need to get back to the text book.  No currency works if it is not first a store of value (I mean that's just common fucking sense).  Also, you might won't to take a peek at the whitepaper, because there was clearly an intention for both from the creator(s).


Why the hell not?  What if I am saving for a down payment?  What if I need to sell corn now and buy fertilizer in six months?  I'm seriously asking.  Why should it be a prerequisite for a good currency to not be something worth saving for more than a month?  If I have to spend it within a month, wouldn't I opt for one that could speculatively be held onto for a year?  If I have to spend it in a year, wouldn't I opt for one that could speculatively be held onto for a decade?  Unless I stand to potentially gain from accepting the one month currency, I don't see why I would choose to accept a currency that shouldn't be held for more than a month.


Why not if its demand grows?  Suppose a nation's economy grows to the point that others insist on doing business with that nation, and therefore need their currency.  Either the holders of the currency will reap the benefit, or the printers of the currency will reap the benefit, but either way, it was a solid investment.  Why shouldn't the holders of the currency be the beneficiary?


Care to support your conclusion?  I didn't invoke them, you did, and then dismissed with authority (you have definitely not earned that authority through this series of postings).  I wouldn't have invoked them, I don't see the point.  But I have to say, your dismissal is not persuasive as an authority.


I wanted to ask you why this is true even after I read your explanation below.  If it were $2, why not fall to $1, then rise to $3?  What makes $2 stable?  
Then this is your dumbass explanation...


Where the fuck did you come up with this?  The market price (maybe you meant "true value" or some dumbass shit) absolutely floats with supply and demand, and is certainly not anchored to shit.  This is true with all assets in a free market.  God damn!  Seriously, where the fuck are you from?  It's like you read some textbook, and took a few portions out of context, deluded yourself into thinking you were an expert economist, and then came on here to fail to even articulate what it was you even read.  I mean, I was going to use a Socratic method to educate you, but what the fuck?


Why?  I thought you said its price was anchored.


On this point, I can actually decipher what it is you are saying.  You are saying that slight inflation is good for an economy, because it encourages the changing of hands of goods and services, and discourages the hoarding of wealth.  Maybe you are correct.  However, assuming you are, you still fail to articulate how the fact that Bitcoin would destroy the world's economies makes it less likely to succeed.  At most, you've described the fact that Bitcoin creates a tragedy of the commons.  How does that make Bitcoin fail?  It seems that it would make Bitcoin succeed.  Why would anyone choose storing wealth in a currency that loses value due to the actions of a "functioning government" when they could store wealth in a currency that holds it value?
@_date: 2017-02-14 19:39:52
I'm waiting for you to figure out that they can and are regulating Bitcoin.  They now are in a position to decide what Bitcoin is.
It began with monopolizing ASIC production.  This allowed them to win the mining arms race.  Presently, Bitmain controls mining.  And Bitmain is subject to Chinese authorities.  From this position (absent an algo change), they can prevent any affirmative changes to Bitcoin.  It seems they exercise that power to prevent changes that would make it harder to regulate Bitcoin (e.g., SegWit).
Once mining is controlled, affirmative changes can be prevented, but this is not enough to implement desirable changes.  That ability requires control over market options.  In other words, they need the ability to control what options the market has in choosing what is "Bitcoin."  For instance, if the rest of the world soft-forked in SegWit, the Chinese exchanges and miners could refuse to recognize the chain and could deprive its market of the option.  Conversely, if they decided to implement BU and a fork occurred, they could recognize only the forked chain as "Bitcoin."
In order to establish this position, they must only control exchanges.  But it will be even more feasible if they also control the coins of their population.  Accordingly, they will likely move to act as "custodians" for Bitcoin holdings (perhaps a state ran BitGo).  This will protect consumers, prevent money laundering, and prevent capital flight.
Once this is all accomplished, they will open the doors for investors to store wealth in Bitcoin with the safety of state protection.  The market will be flooded with Chinese investors who are always looking for such.  Now China controls the protocol entirely, because any "successful" fork attempt requires support of the market.  But China will dominate the market cap and supply that market with only its options.
The only way around this is an algo change.  But such an algo change will have to be done with an acquiescence from the community that the old chain will not die.  In other words, we are already at a point where we can't kill the chain that China has co-opted, so we are the ones that would have to "spinoff."  Might not be such a bad idea, considering the circumstances.  u/nullc what say you?

One thing is for sure.  Bitmain is never going to signal SegWit, because it adds too much potential for privacy in Bitcoin.  And Jihan is afraid the PBoC will come banging down his doors like they have with their exchanges.
I'm cool with the prospect of never having SegWit.  But if it's going through, a "flag day" fork is going to be the way it gets implemented.  Jihan is not the type to challenge authority.

The problems show up from 3-4 MB.  See Toomim's HK presentation (he was a huge BIP101 supporter until he figured out the hard way what the Core devs new by reason).
Segwit provides up to 4 MB in unusual circumstances. 1.6 MB, however, is a low estimate.
But if you fork to 2MB then Segwit maxes out at about 8 MB.  The choice is obvious; Segwit increases capacity, fixes malleability, adds scripting (which makes room for Confidential Transactions), and fixes a problem of geometric time growth for transaction validation (which allows for somewhat larger cap increases).

There is no way he would have invited him to speak knowing of these accusations.  That wouldn't take much gumption.  On the other hand it takes a little courage to confront someone and uninvited them.  I hope he had it.
Using your reasons he should allow Karpeles to have the stage as well if he pays for it.  He also hasn't been "proven" to be a con man.

It absolutely does imply endorsement.  Also, endorsement is inferred by many unsuspecting victims.  Why do you think the con man would pay to have a speaking part?  It helps his cause.


Of course, by detectives, then by a jury of their peers, not as a "speaker" at the big conference.  You may as well give them a medal, because that's exactly how Garza intends to (successfully) use his new-found status as Bitcoin conference speaker.  He is going to rip people off by using it to gain their confidence (hence con man).  That's the point.

It's not really chicken meet egg.  It must be useful as a store of value before it can be useful as a medium of exchange.  Then the two can perpetuate one another.  However, like gold is presently, Bitcoin could simply work very well for savings, but never really become a mainstream medium of exchange.
My bet is that it will become both, store of value and mainstream medium of exchange.  Then eventually unit of account.

When Ver posted a link to this.  I responded with a first impression challenge.  He did not reply.  I know he says that he was just selling fireworks for pest control purposes, but it seems dubious and so I challenged (hoping for an explanation).  I have not received a response, suggesting that there is no "good" response.  For my purposes, I saw no reason to investigate much further.  There have been some scoundrels in Bitcoin.  It's important that we make sure we know who we promote.
You can read the post here, I have copied the response below as well:
You say:
"While everyone else, including the manufacturer, were simply asked to stop selling them I became the only person in the nation to be prosecuted."
However, here is a guy who was prosecuted and convicted by a jury.
Kenneth Shearer, in 2002 for selling the PCR 2000.  
In another instance, a conviction was given for mere possession.
United States v. Jackman, 72 Fed. Appx. 862 (3d Cir. 2003)
The thing is... He wasn't merely in possession, he had altered it. Apparently, it is was not too difficult to convert these into IED's, which he had done.
Given your political persuasion, and your disdain for government, it doesn't seem like too far a stretch to believe that maybe you were selling these to people in order to aid in destruction rather than "pest control" remedies. I mean, you don't really seem like the type of guy who is interested in farming and what not. And given that there are so many ways to make a buck... Why this?
Could this be why you were prosecuted and plead guilty? I mean, I read your story and I just wonder what else there is to it? I found one inconsistency with your story and reality in just a few minutes.

If you guys use some sort of kid gloves method of making him back out, then good enough for me.  Personally, I would use the "bullet to the head" approach.  See Moneyball  
I've tried things the passive way.  It sucks compared to just being straight forward blunt.
Nonetheless, if you are expecting him to not show, and he does, you and Moe (maybe voorhees) will likely be blameworthy for someone getting suckered by the status given to this guy.\
With regard to whether or not he will speak:
I suspect that anyone with the nerve to run a straight confidence game will have the nerve to face critics considering that he really has nothing to lose, and has a chance to persuade.  At the end of the day he still gets to say that he "speaks" at Bitcoin conferences (put that nonsense on his resume', if you will), then use that to gain confidence on the neverending supply of newcomers to this community.
@_date: 2015-01-25 13:59:27
Your critical reading/thinking skills could use a little sharpening.
The FED can print unlimited money,  but they did not back Ponzi.  
If the FED did back Ponzi, maybe the scheme wouldn't have collapsed.
Now for a deeper discussion:
Banking is really not the best analogy of a government Ponzi type scheme.  Social Security is better.  The current beneficiaries are being paid primarily by those who are not at retirement age--those who are presently "saving."  The current beneficiaries' savings were spent long ago.  So like a Ponzi scheme it is the new money that is paying back the old "investors."  
However, SS. Is backed by Congress which can borrow unlimited funds from the FED (in a roundabout way).  Therefore if SS were going to collapse, it would be saved and the beneficiaries would not suffer the entire loss.  Instead, the system would be "bailed out."  This would spread the loss that would have occurred only for SS. participants to all dollar holders through the inflation of the currency.
If bitcoin were the world currency, it would not allow for this sort of "bail out" or the type where we save a bank or insurance company that has over leveraged themselves, becoming insolvent.
I've been holding Bitcoin for years, and have never decided whether from societies' perspective this is a pro or a con of the currency (the lack of a trusted entity to be able to create more).  However, from the individual's perspective, it is definitely a pro to hold currency that can't be devalued from inflation.  Therefore, I have held Bitcoin thinking it would be a winner, even if it were in some sort of tragedy of the commons fashion.  Regardless of whether it's best for society, it's best for the individual.  And the individual decides if society adopts or not.

It's relatively cheap and easy to fill the mempool.  It's expensive to actually cause fees to materially rise.
Now when people flood the mempool it's not publicized.  But when they first started to do so ("stress test") it was made very public as an attempt to force XT on everyone.
See 
They attempted to prove that a cap increase was desperately needed.  What they actually proved was that by raising your fee slightly, it would make their attack too expensive to actually harm the functionality of the network.  **The mempool being full is meaningless if it's not causing fees to materially rise.**  Anyone can inexpensively generate lots of low fee transactions that will take up the remaining space in blocks after transactions with already low, but reasonable fees, are in the block.

Generally, in a criminal case, facts are determined by a jury, but since he plead guilty to the charges, a jury wasn't necessary for fact-finding.
Nonetheless, I am assuming that you are referring to other facts, facts that haven't been tried before a jury.  I expected you to link to them and summarize the pivotal points, considering you are the one suggesting that in spite of his guilty plead he is basically innocent.
If you aren't willing to do that, you're basically just saying "trust me."  I don't trust you.  You told me that you would definitely like to have Karpeles speak at a conference and you've been advocating on behalf of Garza speaking in Miami.

The difficult answer to this is:
"Scammer, I've been put in a tough position here.  You have a lot of accusers who insist that you have done wrong.  I personally don't have enough information to decide, but I am willing to hear you out, just not on my podium.  It's too risky, and therefore not in our best interest.  It's a tough decision, but it is final.  I wish you well, and if this all blows over maybe in the future we can try again.  We just can't, in good conscience, associate the name of Bitcoin with this controversy."

Where did you come across this info?  Did you embellish to make sense of the situation or is this actually true (the whole contract thing?).

Who cares if they are "full"?  Right now users who pay a fee of more than 2 cents (assume average transaction size of 258 b per 21.co) encompass about 60% of blocks and get confirmed quickly--at 5 cents next block.  The remainder of space is filled with free-loading spam.  It does no affect the performance of users with updated wallets.
The primary negative effect is wasting space--lots of space when multiplied across all nodes.  And this space wasting is done at a very low cost to the attacker.  Increasing the block size would just allow for wasting space more quickly, but at the same cost per kb.
At 10 MB blocks, for instance and ignoring other problems, the attacker could waste about 9.6 MB x 6600 nodes every 10 minutes.  This is about a 24x increase in their space wasting capability, but the cost per on wasted stays the same or decreases.
You are definitely looking at this from the wrong perspective (which is understandable given the full-block mania).  Full blocks are of no (very little) consequence if spam is required to "fill" them.

Here, there is no question that someone is spamming.  See  fees.21.co
There are presently over 50k transactions with practically no fee consuming remainder block space after normal fee transactions are committed.
So the question becomes who is doing it.  Obviously someone who "predicted" the event becomes suspect.  They become especially suspect when they also have a political motive to push the build they control.

It took me a minute to realize why you were saying what you said.
I wasn't wondering how you knew the information that was in the link I posted (that he bought them from a South Carolina company and sold them illegally).
I was wondering how you know the nature of the explosives?  Meaning... How do you know that these were more like little pest control "fireworks" and not more like dangerous sticks of "dynamite?"
After reading a few responses in this thread, it seems to me like "fireworks" is the misnomer that may be used by the dealers to deceitfully hide the fact that they are selling illegal explosives.
This is not an uncommon practice among criminals (see "bath salts" that will stone you our of your mind).
Please keep in mind that it may seem easy to equivocate on the definition of a firework vs. explosive until you reach a point that an argument ends in a stalemate.  This seems like a tactic that some would take on this topic.  But... thankfully there is an answer to the question, the difference is in the amount of the explosive material that is contained in the explosive.  Regulatory officials, have already determined the amount that is safe for consumer sales, and the amount that is far too dangerous and therefore is illegal.  Ver's "fireworks" "each contained nearly 1,000 milligrams of explosive powder, which is far in excess of the legal limit for consumer firecrackers." see

Why huge?  It would seem that this would only be important to the segment of the market that is wishing to engage in "capital flight."  For those who are simply wishing to save and trade, there should be no reason to withdraw, because the PBoC actually is deemed trustworthy by most of the population.
But I only suspect a monitored withdrawal as an incremental stage that could lead to no withdrawals.  I recognize that even under a "monitored withdrawal," all withdrawals would be viewed with suspicion.  But I think a monitored withdrawal would be the first stage, because I think they recognize that a kid-gloves approach to this is required in order to prevent a movement to the underground market.
When surveying their options, they surely consider just outright banning digital currencies, but everyone knows that that rarely works.  Accordingly, they must find a way to bring Bitcoin under their purview without driving a huge portion underground.  To do this, they must find a way to segment the market of Bitcoin enthusiasts and legitimize usages that they are okay with (saving and trading).  At the same time, they are looking for ways to exercise enough control to tamper usages that are a threat to their power.  They don't need to completely prevent all capital withdrawal.  Measured/monitored withdrawal will serve well in the interim to stifle the behavior.
Of course, this plan has been in the works for a while.  A few years ago, attempting to implement such a plan would have been problematic for a couple of reasons.  (1) the protocol could be  changed to somehow route around.  (2) Until they were included in the IMF's SDR (approved in October), they needed the appearance of loose capital controls.  So during the interim time, they have sought (could be serendipity) to monopolize Bitcoin mining under their jurisdiction--they have caused Bitmain to prevail and others to fail (see Avalon merger denial, among other things).  Now that they have controlled mining, they have no fears of protocol changes.  And because they are included in SDR, they have no worries about capturing their exchanges in a publicly visible manner.
From this position, they have not won.  But they are well-positioned to win.  They can't yet decide what Bitcoin is, but they can prevent it from becoming what they don't want it to be.  And they are fine with Bitcoin as it is.
“for they knew that war was not to be avoided, and could be deferred only to the advantage of the other side.”  Niccolo Machiavelli, *The Prince*
The Chinese authorities have positioned themselves to defer this battle indefinitely--until their position is most advantageous.  We cannot kill their chain.  Even if we "spinoff," we cannot get their exchanges to recognize our chain.  In time, their position will only become more advantageous.
But if nothing else, the Chinese authorities will be happy to simply be in their current position.  By controlling exchanges and exercising custodial rights, they will be able to supply their market with choices for digital currencies that allow for saving/speculating, and deprive their "legitimate" market of options that they cannot regulate.  This path is way better than simply driving everyone underground.

Many people think was trying to introduce a poison pill in Classic by suggesting means to decentralize mining.  I'm convinced that he was acting in earnest.  Also,  if it weren't for political repercussions, I'm convinced it's a great idea (Classic would have considered it a good if their motives weren't political).  But if the present miners and a lot of the community go with Classic, the political dissension caused by Core fixing mining incentives would be null.  Accordingly, a HF to Classic would make for perfect timing (possibly the only time) for Core to make such a move.
However, if the miners stick with Core, this is not feasible.
This whole blocksize debate caused me to start paying careful attention to individual developers.  The longer I watch, the more I am convinced that luke-jr has a technical understanding that is surpassed by none.  His ideas often seem radical at first glance, but are usually (always?) thoroughly considered and technically better than alternatives.  Moreover, it's refreshing to see that he states his ideas notwithstanding the likely potential for negative reception.

Nope.  It's about the method.  There is the Core way, which begins with Segwit.  And there is Classic, which changes the value of a constant.  The constant is named MAX_BLOCK_SIZE.  But once you segregate the witnesses, it no longer represents maximum block size.  I can see how that could confuse some, but slight critical analysis should allow an average thinker to overcome.

Just as a matter of rights, shouldn't this already be easy for people to do--innocent people?
Shouldn't innocent people be able to conduct business without intermediaries meddling in their affairs, giving a stamp of approval or disapproval before than can exchange funds?
Typically cash is exchanged hand to hand without a need for a third party.  There was never a problem with this idea; it seemed a fundamental right.  Crime has always existed.  Should innocent people have their rights taken away to prevent it?  (Maybe they should, especially if the crime is extremely wide spread and heinous--like maybe people, innocent or not, shouldn't be allowed to posses certain weapons without a license).
But should restricting financial transactions--a most basic human affair--be done to stop the crimes that are mentioned, especially when those crimes already run rampant without Bitcoin through the current system?  Why not take away the right of speech?  This would prevent a lot of crimes.  Why not get rid of the internet, which hosted the Silk Road?  Is the internet more of a right than conducting person to person financial transactions--which has been a part of society for a lot longer than the internet?
The free-exchange-of-currency-promotes-crime argument is going to have to start standing up to some serious scrutiny.  Even mainstream US national news anchors are beginning to question it.  In the past no one had a real reason to question it, because the fiat banking system was the only choice.  Now with Bitcoin, it is beginning to appear with some that there is a viable alternative emerging, and now they will be forced to question:  Why shouldn't I be able to move my funds where I choose without asking permission?  I am free, right?

There's the rub.
Go use PayPal.  Bitcoin's only advantage is decentralization as a store of value (and its concomitant means of exchanging).  In terms of a high-capacity payment system it sucks.  That may change with new developments--great.
Some of you are willing to make it centralized so that people will use it.  But **if it's centralized (i.e. easily governable), who gives a damn if people use it--it's just another fiat currency.**
Right now Bitcoin is almost governable by regulating about 20 exchanges and 20 mining pools (that's a problem that needs to be solved, not exacerbated).  But presently if that were attempted, node operators could provide for a fork and an algo change to start solo mining.  However, once node operations becomes too costly for the ordinary user, it's over.  Bitcoin becomes completely subject to eventual governance (probably by those who typically govern).
For someone who holds himself as a government hating Libertarian, this should matter most to you.  But I guess the chance to get rich masquerading a centralized currency under the guise of decentralized is more motivating than principles.

I realize that you are brainstorming.   That's cool.  In the same spirit, what's the point?  If they accept bitcoin, why not just use your electronic wallet (cell phone, Trevor, etc.).  I mean, I guess they could accept a paper wallet, but then they would immediately need to sweep the funds into an address where only they control the keys and now the paper is worthless.
In order to do this, there would need to be an internet connection, if there is, then why not just send the funds electronically yourself?

With about 20 pools (and an incentive to use pools) and about 20 exchanges (and an incentive to use exchanges with high volume) Bitcoin is already suffering from centralization problems.
If ordinary people can't run nodes, then pools become a necessity (solo mining becomes too costly for most).  At that point, it's over.  It's not a "little" centralization.
The thought you've had is not a novel one.  It's been considered (by me and certainly by leading Core devs) and determined not worth the cost.

I see your perspective.  Fiat can be seized if found, while Bitcoin can always be "found," but never seized without the consent of the key holder(s) (unless the key is found).  I can also see how a person can reasonably see this as an advantage for fiat.
On the other hand, I'm not sure this is an advantage of fiat.  I guess it would depend on circumstances.  When the Bitcoin are stolen, in the name of justice,  I'll agree it would be better if they could simply be returned in that limited circumstance.  However, we don't live in a vacuum, so if they could be taken in this circumstance, they could be taken in an unjust circumstance as well.  So if this were the case, then I'd want nothing to do with Bitcoin.  Not because I don't love justice, but because an appeal of Bitcoin is that they can't be taken from me (without my consent-possibly coerced) by an authority, no matter the cause.
From a practical standpoint, I would like Bitcoin to be untraceable (like fiat) while still remaining secured (by incredible mathematics).  I would like to see it be as private as fiat (cash, gold) and more secure than Fort Knox.  I think the policy of having sound money outweighs ideal justice when the two are mutually exclusive. 
I still love seeing justice served.  Thankfully, it still can be served, albeit not as swiftly and efficiently.  But it will just have to be done through traditional methods of detective work, trials, etc.
Somehow the keys were retrieved from Ulbricht.  If the Gox thief (seemingly Karpeles) can be discovered I hope to see them in jail and hopefully the wealth they took can be seized (negotiated, coerced, whatever) from them and returned to its rightful place (kind of like Ulbricht scenario).
Nonetheless,  if it can't be returned,  then it's a sad injustice,  but still not worth destroying sound (private and secure) money to resolve the injustice.

I don't know enough about these things to know if they "should" be legal or not.  Seems to me like they should, since (at 2000 mg) they have 40 times the legal limit (for most jurisdictions?) for a consumer grade firecracker like a black cat.

People perceive Classic as scammy.  This is because people lied about its support; it  provides no real advantage; it's a copy of Core; and it seems politically motivated.  You guys spinning up a bunch of nodes on cloud services with very limited resources (probably just listening nodes, if not just a bunch of IP addresses pointing to one node) looks scammy.  No one believes you when you say it's for DDOS prevention.  Whether informed or uninformed, when it comes to perception, opinions are all that is valid.  In this case, however, we are well informed, and you guys are a scammy little bunch.

Not ASAP, but aiming for April.  Why not?  Segwit is awesome.  It fixes malleability, can allow for even additional upgrades, is relatively easily implemented, and provides a capacity increase.  It could be done faster, but great care is being given for even a relatively simple implementation.  Smart devs!!
@_date: 2016-01-10 15:32:34
In addition to the lower fees is referring to, most wallet devs, exchanges, etc.   will want Segwit to be used because it removes transaction malleability.  After a while, transactions that aren't using Segwit will look suspicious (because they could possibly be used for fraud).

Populist.  Antonopoulus chooses his positions with a wet finger in the air to see which way the wind is blowing.  He hates stepping on toes.  Classic's goal is to defeat/marginalize Core.  To support Classic is to oppose Core, NOT support it.
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:16:38
Core's not determining the block size.  A UASF requires an even greater consensus among the economy than a miner-lead soft fork.  A UASF is a miner mandate only if practically all of the non-miners consent.  To consider that centralized is absurd.
Edit:  To be perfectly honest, I wouldn't be surprised to see this go through even if it's not merged by Core.  I could see the exchanges (with support of holders) simply doing it themselves.

Back of thr napkin math...
Conservatively, let's say their daily volume is 5000.  And that on average they take .4% from each side (.8% total).
5000 x .008 x 365 days x $275 is roughly $4mm in revenue per year.
Say $2mm in expenses and you've very conservatively got $2mm in net income per year.  
I could easily get to $5mm NI.  
So with no growth $5mm could be invested for a 33% equity stake and payout in 3 to 8 years.  With a shit-ton of upside...

We do.  See "The more transactions, the better."
But... "that cannot come at a detrimental cost to Bitcoin's tamper-resistant nature"
With a few transactions per second, Bitcoin can be wildly successful as a store of major wealth ("safe asset") (See $6.5 billion market cap).  That's true even with much higher confirmation fees.  Of course, more transactions is better.  But if the transactions come at a cost to tamper-resistance, then the attractiveness as a safe asset wanes greatly.  A successful hard-fork is tampering; it begs the question, "what else can be tampered with?"
Transactions can scale off-chain (even through trusted mechanisms like VISA).  I would prefer to see transactions scale through trustless methods--which are in development.  But even if those weren't in development, I'm not willing to compromise Bitcoin's tamper-resistance for some throughput (especially when feasible cap increases give such slight throughput increases).
If Bitcoin is to have a payment system that scales to VISA levels, it will have to be through a mechanism that does not require every transaction to be handled by every node operator.  This can be done at other layers (even trusted layers).  But if the blockchain is not tamper-proof, no additional layers can help.

It might help to name names here.  Increased fungibility would run contrary to the goals of Chinese authorities.  And it seems that they have now co-opted Bitcoin.
ASIC manufacturing has been monopolized in one entity--Bitmain.  Bitmain is using its position to seize the political power that comes with mining.  The Chinese authorities just conducted a month-long experiment with fees at parity with Western markets to learn that they actually do have a large portion of the economic market under their jurisdiction.  Now they seem poised to introduce a mandatory third-party custodianship for all of the exchanges (sort of a PBoC version of BitGo).
With mining centralized under their jurisdiction, the Chinese authorities are able to stop any affirmative changes to Bitcoin's behavior (SegWit).  And in the event of a "flagged fork" implementation, with control over the wallets of this many exchanges, they are able to prevent a large portion of the economy from adopting--their economy won't even have the option.  In fairly short time, the Chinese authorities will likely be able to implement any changes they like, and they won't care about the market disruption from a potential chain split.  Worse, as "custodian" limiting the options to their population, any split in the chain that does not follow them will have its market value at the mercy of Chinese authorities who can dump all of the coins it is holding on the chain they no longer recognize.
With all that said, yes, fungibility is bad for some entities, and there is one in particular that is sure to stop it.
You know I am very much pro-immutability.  But I think any hint of "immutability" in Bitcoin is now pretense.  The political power from controlling mining and controlling market options is so highly concentrated that we are all now subject to the decisions of the PBoC.  And while they can't presently act on whims, in time they will have even this ability.  And there is nothing we can do to kill their chain.  
We can either move on to other coins, or implement an algo-change.  The latter would be the equivalent of a so-called "spinoff."
**Here's the bitch of it.**  Despite what people might intuitively expect from "centralization," this move from the PBoC is likely to result in Bitcoin's market value increasing.  Their custodianship will serve as a blessing on Bitcoin for their investors to use it to store wealth and trade.  This will be like the Chinese equivalent of an ETF.  This case is well-made well on 8btc.

The quote is taken out of context a bit.  First, it's actually a quote from Mike Hearn who claims he's quoting Satoshi in Dec. 2012 from an email in 2009 (he probably was quoting him, but the source is a factor to consider).  
Second, taken in context, it seems that Satoshi is talking about something other than Bitcoin as we know it.
Here is the full paragraph quoted the omission highlighted.


The remainder of the post is about keeping up with Moore's law.  But he never explains how in 2009 Bitcoin could keep up with Visa on *existing hardware*, which should not even require Moore's law to explain.  However, we know Satoshi put in payment channels, so maybe he was referring to some rudimentary concept of what is currently being designed in order to scale Bitcoin?  Who knows?
Regardless of his unshared idea, we know for certain that in 2009 Bitcoin could not scale if every transaction needed confirmation (as we presently understand it).  We know this based on study.  But we also can surmise that Satoshi knew this also, or else he would not have been discussing Moore's law.
Did Satoshi foresee the Lightning Network--I mean payment channels really aren't that useful unless they are routed?  Did Satoshi envision some other sort of off chain solution and consider only the decentralized nature of the underlying currency to be the important consideration for scaling?  Was he full of shit?  Was Hearn full of shit?
These questions are hard to answer, since he never explained "the ways it would cope with extreme size."

First, let's be clear.  Bitcoin is being used.  Hence the requests for more capacity.
To your point.  You have been telling (selling) people on the merits of a decentralized system.  But now, in order for those people to all be able to use the system (as you envision), you suggest you are willing to compromise its decentralized nature.  Their usage seems more important to you than the principle that you sold them on--decentralization.
But unless you are trying to make money off their usage, why should you care if they adopt a Bitcoin that becomes centralized/governable--that's just another fiat.

It seems awfully naive to believe these two moves would bring peace.  The mob is unreasonable.  They don't want what is best for Bitcoin.  Rather, they want to feel powerful under the guise of doing what's best for Bitcoin.  
There are surely some acting in earnest, but far too many are acting out of misplaced anger and hateful pride.  Those feelings won't be satiated with reasonable concessions.  Concessions will be viewed as appeasements, only strengthening their appetite for destruction.  This is not a business deal where both sides will accept a win-win.  The mob's unreasonable desire is for Core to lose and lose big.  These 2 moves will only energize and embolden them further.
The best, most reasonable, move for Bitcoin is the roadmap.  Core's best move is to stick to that roadmap unless there is a better plan.  Stick to the principle of following the best plan.

I've been telling you guys this for months.  You never wanted to hear it.
Bitcoin as a protocol is designed to be immutable when it comes to removing restrictions.  It requires a lot of collaboration to pull off such a feat, and a small few can veto the change because no one wants to do something that will likely harm the whole thing.  Not enough will ever be willing to split the baby ( so status quo wins.
Consensus for a coordinated change is hard.

Nothing can be purchased until there is first value stored.  There is no question which must come first.  However, utility for payments can create a positive feedback loop.  Of course, Bitcoin has a built-in payment system.  To make the payment system better is good, but not necessary for Bitcoin to be a "safe asset."  But to expand the payment network at the cost of the tamper-resistant nature of Bitcoin kills it's utility as a "safe asset"--it's killer app.

No.  Everyone understands each other well enough.  The problem is that some miners reasonably see SegWit as being against their interest.  It will result in an immediate reduction in fee income and allow for transactions to move off chain where no fee is paid to miners.  And for Jihan specifically, it will remove the pressure he's using try to coerce people into switching to BTU.  If he were to manage this, the block size would be in his control and he can use the power to slowly push out competitors through resource exhaustion.
Communication is not going to change any of these things.  An upgrade like SegWit will always need to be user-activated.  Miners are never going to approve such, and we shouldn't expect them to take one for the team--our interests aren't aligned.

Not true.  The attack is wasting space, as there are no other material effects.  Increasing the cap simply allows for wasting space more quickly at the same (actually less) cost per kb wasted.


What defense?  Storing spam forever?  The defense is the cap--that's why Satoshi implemented it.  For the attacker to actually start displacing bona fide users (with properly updated wallet software), he would have to increase his fees, which would be met in kind by users.  This process makes it cost prohibitive to actually deny usage through spamming.  **The cap is serving Satoshi's reason perfectly how he envisioned and described.**

You can afford it.  It's cheap.  It's also ineffective at actually denying service to the network (just pay the usual low fee).

@_date: 2016-01-01 23:46:33
Actually the reasoning is very strong but not that Bitcoin mining actually be decentralized, but that it appear decentralized (if you are capable of gaining more than 51%).
If it becomes known that Bitcoin mining has become centralized then Bitcoin's value would reasonably be expected to drop thereby harming the miner's interest (so long as they are not conflicted with an interest that wants to harm Bitcoin).
Of course, if a miner (or group) could *covertly* control more than 50% then that might rationally be in their interest.  Which is why I said I would not be surprised to learn that there is collusion.  But even this is risky, because again, if discovered, they may be destroying their gravy train.
I look forward to any working changes that remove this incentive.

**No dishonesty at all, and I don't appreciate the assertion.**
Under Segwit actual max block size increases.  There is a misconception that it is only an "effective" increase.  But that is false.  A block consists of transaction data and witness data.  Under the current scheme the combined total must be under 1 MB.  Under Segwit (without a HF first), however, only the transaction data is limited to 1 MB, and there is no limit to the witness data.  Under strange scenarios that creates an actual block size of up to 4 MB.  Under current scenarios like 1.7 MB.  But if people start using 2FA authentication with 2of3 Multisigs the actual block size could be over 2MB.
Block size is still transaction data + witness data.

It seems to me that the push for a new POW  scheme would likely destabilize the community more than the present divide.  I'll agree that if Core maintains miner support that now is a bad time to introduce the change.  However, if the miners abandon Core, that may prove the most opportune time, politically.
Moreover, there may be more practical considerations.  For instance, if there is all of this available hash power securing Classic, and not much securing the Core chain, what is to stop someone from dumping a lot on Core momentarily to mess things up?  Additionally, if all of the hash power has moved to another build on a different chain, how will the core chain be secured if the Classic coin is more valued by the market (miners could be more greatly rewarded by hashing for the Classic chain, it would depend)?  So, Core would need to be able to be mined by people with little or no investment.  Luke's plan could provide for that.
My first preference would be for everyone to stick with the Core roadmap.  But my second preference WAS for Core to compromise IF it seemed the market was moving to Classic regardless, as I believe the market would remain with Core.  But now, I may actually be leaning more towards Core sticking to the roadmap regardless and doing as Luke suggests IF the market goes to Classic.

Yes you have :).  I'm often a bit of an ass to people demanding cap increases, but that's because most seem to argue the most disingenuous positions in the most caustic ways.  I'm told (and believe) that you are reasonable, especially after watching your video.  Accordingly, I want to make sure I totally understand your position.  I actually think reasonable people can disagree on this to some degree (so long as they don't ignore serious pitfalls, such as degradation of propagation times--which you are not).


Fair enough.  Ultimately, there should be only one position that you are presently advocating.  It should include your personal preference and your preference for what you think is the best course of action for the community.  In fact, I think that the position advocated that considers the community is all encompassing.  Thus, I am interested in that one most (but also the other.  However, you have already told me from your studies that 8 MB will cause too much harm to the network for me to be sold on it--at least without improvements such as IBLT...).
So in the context of what is best for the community you are advocating a compromise of at least 2MB.  So you are good with 2MB for now?  Right?
So when (if) Segwit gets implemented as planned by those developers, it will initially provide a bit of "can kick."  In that circumstance, all your asking for extra, considering the best course of action for the community, is an additional "can kick" of 0.454 MB.


Realize that I'm not playing tricks here with your words.  All I'm doing is discerning the answers that you've been dancing around giving.  I'm merely, stating your position, which is something you are avoiding.  The reason you might be avoiding it is because you've come to realize that what you really want (BIP101) is not really in the best interest of the community.  But the difference between what you think is the best course of action for the community (if Segwit is implemented as planned) and what is scheduled to transpire seems petty (a mere 0.454 MB increase via a hard fork).  Afterall, Segwit, as planned, will provide some "can kick"--probably enough to get IBLT implemented without a 0.454 MB increase.  In the best interest of the community, don't you think maybe (at least if Segwit is implemented as planned) you should drop it for a while?  You're really only asking for a 0.454 MB increase, isn't it better for the community if you use your influence to help reunite it after others have ripped it apart?
I'm not really looking for a reply to the questions.  They just seemed worthy of your consideration.

Do you think Segwit should be implemented at all?
If so, then if Segwit is already creating a negative network security effect (and adding some capacity increase), then does this not mean that we have even less room for a cap increase?
Also, if you think Segwit should be implemented, from what I'm hearing you say (correct me if I'm wrong) a 0.25 MB increase would satisfy your present wishes right?  1.75+.25 gets us into the 2-4 range.  Am I misunderstanding that?

Basically, there is a back door already.  Software updates can be performed through the Lightning cable port without the passcode.  A U.S. Magistrate Judge for the Central District of California has ordered Apple to write and sign a version of the OS that removes security features preventing brute force.  Then Apple must give the software to the FBI so that they may brute force the password.
Of course Apple has hired the most expensive white-shoe law firm to get the order vacated.
Apple needs to immediately fix the first back door.  They need to make it so that even via hardware upgrades, a password must be entered to upgrade.  But for support reasons they probably would like to keep it there.

Well.  Such a hard fork would not require miner consent.  It would be done without their approval.  Such would have to activated at a certain block height or some other non-miner-involved flag.  To pull it off, you would need most of the community's consent and practically all of the exchanges to agree to treat the forked chain as the "real" Bitcoin.  I've always thought such would be practically impossible.  But it may be the case that if a couple of ASIC manufacturers decide to co-opt Bitcoin, the community might form the requisite "consensus" to make them eat their investments.

You can.  I'm sure there are alts that do this.  If not, make one.  Build whatever you want, sell your Bitcoin and buy up your new coin.  Fork the code base all you like, but hijacking the blockchain is a different story.  Bitcoin is designed to prevent this unless you have won overwhelming mass appeal.

That they can attack is the attack.  Once they are in this position, they can defer exercising their ability to change things until they reach a point where a defense can't work.  As time passes, any prepared defense will likely become less and less effective as more governments clamp down on exchanges and form treaties.
Governments hate the idea of separation of money and state.  Bitcoin is all about that notion.  But once they are in control, they have already defeated the purpose of Bitcoin.  But history should tell us that their control will not stop the market from adopting.  So the smart play would be to gain control early, but simply defer exercise of that control until the economy is fully dependent on the system.  Then, at that point, do something tantamount to removing the gold standard.

This is incorrect perspective and understanding.  The confirmation system has never been scalable (while remaining peer to peer).  But if payments are made off-chain, the currency can be made to scale beyond Visa levels.
Because it won't scale, but is ultra-secure we believe the Blockchain is best used for settlement (not that Bitcoin is best used for settlement, as Bitcoin has multiple meanings).  The aim is not to convert bitcoin into a currency used for settlements only, but instead to scale Bitcoin by building a payment network that still uses bitcoin (the currency) and settles 1000s of payments at-once on the blockchain.
Those proposing that Bitcoin should scale with a lightning network do not propose that Bitcoin (the currency) should be used primarily for settlement. They propose that blockchain confirmations should be used primarily for settlement. That’s because otherwise, if every bitcoin transaction must confirm on the blockchain, we are limited to so few transactions per second (even at 8MB blocks) that Bitcoin won’t scale in usage.
This layered vision serves monetary use cases far better than trying cram every transaction onto the blockchain, which must be acknowledged, stored, and verified by every node and miner.

I know what you said, and you're wrong.
**Under Segwit actual max block size increases.**  There is a misconception that it is only an "effective" increase.  But that is false.  A block consists of transaction data and witness data.  Under the current scheme the combined total must be under 1 MB.  Under Segwit (without a HF first), however, only the transaction data is limited to 1 MB, and there is no limit to the witness data.  Under strange scenarios that creates an actual block size of up to 4 MB.  Under current scenarios like 1.7 MB.  But if people start using 2FA authentication with 2of3 Multisigs the actual block size could be over 2MB.
Under Segwit, block size is still transaction data + witness data.

In the article you say:


The article goes on to imply that Hearn was on the side that wants Bitcoin to be useable by all, and the other side cares about decentralization *at the cost of usability.*  But this is not true.  The other side believes they can have both decentralization and usability by building into Bitcoin a new payment network that comes at no extra cost to decentralization while providing Visa-level scalability.
This distinction could certainly cause a reasonable, but uninformed, reader to side with Hearn when the accurate statement of the positions would lead to the opposite conclusion.
Your mischaracterization of the position of the other side is either laziness or deceit, but either way it's poor journalism.

I don't think docs will be on THE blockchain; hashes of documents will be embedded on THE blockchain for time-stamping and proof of existence.  Most courthouses have their documents online, at least the last couple of decades worth.  I could see a time where at the end of each day (or week), courthouses use a software to embed some sort of hash (or Merkle tree) of their data on THE blockchain for proof of existence.  However, I don't think anyone perceives there's a real problem with courthouses tampering with data.  Accordingly, this will just be a nice security feature to solve a theoretical problem.
Don't get me wrong, I love blockchain technology and Bitcoin.  I just think that some of these theoretical ideas of what could be done will prove to be over-ambitious, because they unnecessarily replace simple working methods with far more complicated methods for questionable/marginal benefits.

No.  They don't plan to kill Bitcoin.  The network will still function.  They plan to remove the underlying feature that caused it to gain traction--decentralized distributed trust.  Many think this will kill its value.  I don't.  No more than removing the gold standard killed the dollar.  They simply plan to co-opt it so that it appears decentralized, but in time it will become fiat.  The only way around this is to algo change.  But that will not kill their chain.  It will, however, split the network effect early on.  I suspect the market will mostly follow Core.  If the network effect goes unchallenged, they will likely succeed in their pursuit.

Sure.  If you change the definition of Bitcoin, to where it is so aloof as to be absolutely amorphous, then they can't regulate "Bitcoin."  You may as well say that about anything.  But if you refer to Bitcoin as the chain that we are currently operating under, then the practical effect is that they have co-opted our blockchain and a great portion of the market that supports it.  And there is nothing we can do to stop them from keeping the chain and adapting **"it"** to their liking.  They can block any other "spinoffs" from reaching mainstream through control of mainstream exchanges.  And by "supporting" the chain that is currently Bitcoin, they can assure that its market cap is relatively high through usage by their population.
Your answer is pretty much a faith-based handwaving that the market will somehow work around.  You're ignoring the fact that they now control mining and market options.  Satoshi Nakamoto described the ability to control Bitcoin with "dishonest" nodes representing more than 51% of hashpower.  The Chinese authorities have now captured far more control than this.  They control the current "Bitcoin."  Perhaps we can spinoff an altcoin and call it "Bitcoin"???
@_date: 2017-02-05 16:04:31


You already said that, but you are painting with too broad a brush.  There are algorithms that the present miners are not able to control with their current hardware.  Moreover, an algo change would so devastate their balance sheets that they would be rendered incapable of competing in the new arena.  Further, the precedent of an algo change would greatly discourage similar attempts to corner the market in the future.
If an algo change were presently possible, it's obvious that it would be good.  But it will require true aggression from the ASIC manufacturers to cause the requisite consensus to form to make the transition a relatively smooth market process.  I doubt it will occur, but it is seeming far more plausible than it did.
@_date: 2016-03-29 17:34:41
Your reasoning does not follow from this quote; it seems unrelated.


After complete adoption of Bitcoin as a store of wealth, it does not matter whether you denominate the value of Bitcoin in terms of fiat or whether you value fiat in terms of Bitcoin.  The change in exchange rates would tend to reflect changes in the value of fiat rather than the value of Bitcoin.
Moreover, nothing I've said suggests Bitcoin can't also be a day-to-day currency.  But widespread day-to-day usage can't happen if every transaction needs individual confirmation.  Attempts to do so are foolishly futile and come at a detrimental cost to Bitcoin's natural usage as a safe asset.

There is a group trying to assemble a consortium to build a similar, but closed, system to compete with Bitcoin.  But apparently, they fear that many of those they wish to have join the consortium would rather align with Bitcoin.  Accordingly, they must spread the perception that Bitcoin has failed in its principles, otherwise they might not garner support.
**Here is the irony.**  Bitcoin neither needs nor wants the approval of the people they are lobbying.  Bitcoin stands on its own and competes only to win the adoption of the everyman.  We don't need the elites; we aim to remove the need for the functions they supply.

If you are given the choice between just 2MB and SegWit (2+- MB with malleability fix and scripting), which one would you choose?
IBLT shows promise to make 2MB and SegWit possible at the same time.  Either will allow about the same amount of time for IBLT to develop, so the question is not which you choose, but which do you choose first?

Nobody needs an official statement.  It's obnoxious that you think you are entitled to one.  The individuals that compose the groups you mentioned can show their support by merely updating their code--the only thing that matters.  The guys at ledger (the hardware wallet) said it's a trivial update.
You can continue to throw a tantrum, but among the people that matter there is consensus for Segwit (i.e. more than enough agreement for there to be no danger in implementation other than the regular risks involved in a change).

The fact that they have to keep asking is evidence that it is contentious.
Some of us think there is a better way to scale.  If some try to fork and some refuse, both are risking destruction.  It's clear here that there are plenty on both sides willing to engage in a practice of mutually assured destruction.  But what they will really do is sell--on both sides.

Yes, of course.  That's what everybody did.  But you can only set that so high before blocking legitimate transactions.  If the attacker is willing to pay the fee, the only thing to stop them from spamming is the rising fee caused by a block cap.  The lower the cap the faster the fees kick in.
I don't know why you are being argumentative.  I'm merely explaining how things work.  You last two responsive have been needlessly argumentative with points that are clearly invalid.
The lower the cap the more difficult the DOS.
Minimum Relay TX Fee should only be used to block transactions with an unusually low fee.  The cap is what forces the attacker to pay fees that are unusually high and therefore prohibitive.

Showing support is the primary reason for running a Classic Node at all at this point, especially since the majority of the code is simply copied from Core.  But it does not show much support at all when everyone can see that a great percentage of the nodes are hosted by cloud services--especially when everyone knows that there are cheap spin-up services that are providing these nodes.  Under this scenario, it does the opposite of show support.  Instead, it suggests a small number of people manipulating.  In the minds of onlookers, the shenanigans overwhelm any show of support.  Classic just looks like more of a joke, as a result.
If cheaters quit doing this, however, everyone suspects Classic would have a node count close to XT's historical.  What to do?  Since the primary purpose is to show support, and since these cloud nodes do the opposite, it seems the reasonable response is for people to take down the cloud nodes and host the nodes on a personal connection, or not at all.  Otherwise, Classic is a joke and the miners are laughing at it.
You made a bad call encouraging people to go to cloud nodes for "DDoS resistance."  To the onlookers--already suspicious of your intentions--it just seems like encouraged manipulation masquerading under a thin disguise.  None are fooled.  This seems just another in a series of manipulative missteps that makes Classic look scammy.  The biggest misstep, however, was claiming the support of companies that did not--that was Classically foolish.  After this, you should have been on your toes to prevent even the slightest appearance of impropriety.  But instead, you urged cloud nodes for "DDoS resistance."  Knowing (at least subconsciously) what you should have done and seeing what you actually did, most will just assume YOU are inherently scammy.
I, on the other hand, feel a little bad for you.  I think you are a young and genuine, but impressionable, guy who got chewed up and spit out in this process.

Ver thinks he is.  But Jihan is motivated by business incentive and ego.  It is in Jihan's interest to co-opt Bitcoin.  It is also in his interest to let Ver and the rest of us think Ver is in control.  But this is Jihan's doing.  Jihan was probably motivated by some early discussions with Gavin that lead Jihan to incorrectly believe that controlling mining was enough to control Bitcoin--this sent him on a mission.
But it is becoming quite clear, that Jihan is doing this to serve his interests which he knows are not aligned with users' interests. 


Edit: Somehow I missed the "Chinese government" portion.
Perhaps.  But I suspect that the control they exercise is not heavy-handed.  Just like the PBoC has talked to the exchanges, they have surely spoken with Jihan.  And the subtle message to Jihan would be that they are fine with Bitcoin so long as no privacy-enhancing features are added.  Also, they are especially happy to help him gain control.
Jihan fears, but will never admit, that if he implements SegWit, then the authorities will bang down his doors like they have their exchanges.

I don't think that's an option unfortunately.  The Segwit that is presently being tested has a theoretical 4MB max.  With a hardfork to 2MB this becomes roughly 8MB, which, as we have seen is far too much for the network.  However, if we had IBLT it could be possible.  In the meantime we could implement one of these options.

Your conspiracy theory is like most: heavy on motive, but weak on evidence.  All you have is a correlation (which is some evidence, but far from conclusive).  But *another reasonable explanation* is that the pools offer very little differences between one another, so individual miners, recognizing the value to Bitcoin (and thus their own operations) if hash power is diversified, simply choose the pool with the lower hash rate when deciding which to add their knew equipment to.  After all, choosing a pool with 26% vs 23% does not really add much value when it comes to helping solve the next block (or variance), so if it is cost free, why not choose the pool that will help benefit Bitcoin as a whole?
With that said, if you did provide conclusive evidence of collusion, I would not be in the least surprised.

If the 25% are mining on the chain that has market value--the one that has always had market value--the one with network effect and first-mover advantage, then they have nothing to worry about.  The 75% will fall back in line as soon as they realize they are mining digital fools' gold.  This will happen if some exchanges support the old chain.  It will happen if some exchanges support both (as all big one's will.  See Brian Armstrong refusal to commit to support Classic exclusive).
The trick to a hard fork is not so much technical (although still quite difficult); it's getting the market to immediately accept and value the new chain as if it were the old.  This requires a commitment to kill the old chain.  That requires the exchanges to commit to doing so.  That commitment is damn near impossible to make for legal reasons (See Peter Todd's podcast) and for practical reasons (your customers want to know they have access to their coins on both chains, not just one).  Without this commitment, the market will know they need to sell.  But with this commitment the market may pull all their funds off an exchange for fear of losing access to coins on the other exchange.  Accordingly, without full commitment and delicate handling, the market is going to sell off.

That it can be transferred to anyone in the world might be all that is required.  Much like land and gold can be exchanged but are rarely used for "payment", bitcoin works well as a "safe asset."  Unlike land and gold, however, Bitcoin is so transferable that it seems like it works well for payments.  With a better payment-system it can.  But transferability, even at a somewhat high cost, is all that is necessary for a safe asset (a few transaction per second suffices, although 50k would be better).
Don't get me wrong.  I'm all for a Bitcoin payment method.  I just won't support that at the cost of its tamper-resistant nature (especially when a cap increase can only give minuscule throughput increase at great cost).  And a hard-fork to remove a restriction is a perfect demonstration of tampering.  That tampering should send a message to those looking to Bitcoin as a "safe asset."

Do you think that is what makes it trade at $1xxx/oz.?
Gold derives most of its value because it is particularly useful as a store of value.  It is scarce, divisible, durable, fungible, easily transported, etc.
Of course some of its value is derived from other uses as well, but certainly not so much  to make it trade at such high figures.  I'd estimate that more than 95% of the value of gold is derived purely from its utility as a currency/money rather than any other use.

Nifty Website that gives a fee breakdown for transactions in the mempool. Apparently for &lt; $380 and a little know how, you too could bloat the mempool and "fill" blocks.
 
Quit freaking out (or trying to incite panic).  Someone just spit out a bunch of low fee transactions that are filling the remainder of blocks after miners include the normal fee transactions.  People have been doing this on a small scale for a while.  Today someone dumped a lot.

No it does not cost more.  It just takes more blocks to consume the same capacity (probably costs a little less too).
For instance, in isolated theory world we could have unlimited blocks, and rather than having to wait, an attacker could spam millions of transactions in one block, killing the network and everyone's hardware in one instance.  But to consume the same amount of resources now (at the same cost), the attacker has to spread the transactions out over a prohibitively lengthy time.  The only way to speed up an attack is to outbid others.  This gets expensive fast (even faster the nearer to full the blocks are with bona fide transactions).

Of course.  Miners can always hard fork.  In fact, a hard fork is required to undo a soft fork.  And that's what would be happening in your scenario--miners would be hard forking to undo the soft fork.
This is simply a different activation method for the same soft fork that SegWit has always been.  The difference is that this method does not rely on miner signaling.  It rely's on the notion that most of the exchanges and users want SegWit, which means that miners will signal if they want to continue to get paid.  But if the users and exchanges are divided, then this probably won't work.
FWIW, I think it will work.  Miners are never going to promote an improvement like SegWit that will result in an immediate and substantial reduction in their fee revenue.  An upgrade like that will always need to be user-activated.

Practically immutable.  Only mutable (in terms of removing restrictions) with consensus.  No contradictions there.  A relatively small minority can stop removal of restrictions.  So unless I find myself so outside the norm of usual human behavior to find practically no support for not changing, Bitcoin won't change without my (and people like me) consent.
The practical immutability of Bitcoin is the primary feature of Bitcoin that separates it from all previous digital currencies.

**It's actually the least complicated solution to fix *transaction malleability*, which has been a problem for years.**  It also has the added benefit of capacity increase.  So yeah full speed ahead.  There really are infinite IFS, as there are infinite possible adoption percentages.  But there's just a few relationships and they all boil down to this: the greater the adoption the more capacity increase there is--such that we quickly approach the 2MB that Lee is asking for.  The relationships (number of its) really aren't too complicated for you unless you are intentionally being stubborn.
Toomim expects adoption to reach 50%.  But this seems low given that Segwit fixes malleability and will save in fees.  Because it solves a problem that leads to fraud and saves money, eventually anyone who doesn't use it will likely/reasonably have their transactions viewed as suspicious.  Accordingly, most wallets will simply implement the proper changes and we will see close to 100% adoption--as we should.  If no one uses Segwit to its full 15 of 15 capacity, in this scenario we need only a trivial 0.143 cap increase to reach Bobby's ideal.
**We get all this (and more) just by fixing transaction malleability.**  Smart devs!!

There are lots of things Core has been working on this past year.  Here are a couple of interest: they have been trying to fix transaction malleability and they have been trying to implement Confidential Transactions.  The problem is both of these were thought to require a hard fork, so they have not tried to implement these, as hard forks are very risky.
Transaction malleability is a design flaw caused by the fact that when a transaction is signed, not all of the data in the transaction is used for the signature.  It was discovered that this could be fixed by separating the Witness data of a transaction from the transaction data (hence Segregated Witness).  Then figured out a way to soft-fork SegWit into the chain.  The purpose of SegWit was to fix malleability, but it also came with added bonuses.
1) because the witness data is separated the way the data is structured can be changed to more easily add features that were previously thought impossible in the past without a hard fork (e.g. possibly Confidential Transactions)
2) Because the block cap only counts the transaction data, segregating the witness data will act as an effective capacity increase.  The increase could theoretically be up to about 4MB, but most expect the increase to effectively be the equivalent of about a 2MB cap (it depends upon its usage).
At about the time it was discovered how to Softfork Segwit in, Jtoomim (creator of Classic and proponent of BIP101) was running tests to prove that BIP101 would not break the network.  But he actually discovered what most of Core already knew; Bitcoin has serious problems related to block propagation when the blocks reach 3-4 MB (some say 2-3 MB).  Toomim presented this data at Hong-Kong and asked around and miners seemed to be happy with a 2MB cap.
There are two ways the 2MB capacity could be reached: either hard fork in a cap increase, or soft-fork in segregated witnesses.  But if bot are done, the total bandwidth requirement would be the equivalent of about a 4-8MB--too much to not harm the network.  So Core is faced with an easy choice: softfork Segwit or hard fork 2MB.  At the time, only one could be done, and clearly SegWit is the best way to go.  The plan is really brilliant.  SegWit solves several problems at once and avoids a risky hard fork.
SegWit will buy the same amount of time as 2MB (possibly more).  That time can be used to work on developing IBLT.  
IBLT would completely change the way blocks are propagated. Instead of requiring each node to download all of the transactions within the block, because most nodes have already had all of the transactions  stored in their mempools, the nodes will instead only download a list of transactions included in the block and then will actually build the block themselves, only downloading missing transactions from connected nodes. Implementing IBLT will so greatly reduce bandwidth requirements for block propagation that an additional cap increase would not be expected to cause the same detrimental effect (meaning the cap could be raised much higher than 2MB).
So, because there is a choice between either SegWit or 2MB, the condensed version of Core's roadmap looks like this.
1) Segwit (which fixes malleability, and adds scripting function, and just so happens to add about the equivalent of 2MB of capacity) 
2) IBLT (and other stuff) 
3) then cap increase as needed (in fact, at this point, a dynamic block cap could be even less risky).

Transaction malleability.  Where have you been?
There are several of malleability, but the most well known is described here.
Here is one way it can be used to defraud someone.








Then there can be:




They can also be used to perform DOS attacks.  See article above.
BIP 62 lists 9 sources of malleability and was aiming to fix some of them.
 .  
However, BIP 62 has been dropped because Segwit fixes them all.  
Transaction malleability can be used for fraud, can accidentally cause loss, and can be used for DOS.  SW fixes those and saves money, therefore industry practice will reasonably move away from transactions that are malleable.  Accordingly, as time passes and fewer use malleable transactions, those who do would reasonably be viewed with suspicion.  A reasonable person who knows that they don't know everything should question why a person would want to spend more money to use a method that has been shown to potentially cause problems.
You're not a pro.
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:03:25
Obviously, if a panic is orchestrated (as the spam attack suggests) then there will be people (maybe a few SockPuppets), as part of the plan, complaining about transactions that either did not happen or transactions that they intentionally got stuck.  This is what would give the plan impact.
Of course, I'm sure there are some innocent users harmed by the attacker.  But any wallet could protect them with proper dynamic fee calculations.
Stats from last 24 hours
If you add all the transactions that confirmed in the last 24 hours with a fee of more than 1 cent, they amount to about 1.7 transaction per second.
At &gt;5 cents, they amount to about .4 transactions per second.  These transactions confirm in 1 block.
In the last 24 hours there were 56788 transactions confirmed with a fee of less than 1 cent.  That's about 0.6 per second.  These transactions are low priority and can wait for long time periods to confirm.  But they will confirm as space in the blocks permits.  Yesterday they represented about 40% of transactions confirmed.
If someone creates a bunch of low fee transactions, the blocks will always be "full".  But it does not prevent quick confirmation by those who pay a fee.  In this case 5 cents would do it.  If you don't care about next block confirmation, 2 cents should likely get you confirmed within about 6 hours.  Wallets can and should calculate fees for their users.  
I blame Mycelium if they have not done this.
I blame the user if Mycelium has and they are not updating.
Ultimately, however, I blame the spammer.

Most wallets are implementing dynamic fees to deal with this issue.  However, I don't think the Core wallet does.  But most people who use core do so to run a full node/mine.  For their actual spending they use a wallet more geared towards consumers like Breadwallet or Mycelium which both have dynamic fee implementations since the "stress tests."

The other thing they could do:
To old nodes, the SegWit transactions would be marked as anyone can spend.  The miner could build on top of the block they don't like with a "malicious block," spending the SegWit transactions.  The old nodes would by default see no problem with the malicious block.
The first thing I mentioned would be the miners hard forking (51% attack).  The second thing I mentioned would not.  The latter is what Jihan is threatening to do.
Either would result in a chain split.  But the question is this:  Which chain will the market recognize and value?
If almost every exchange is operating with upgraded Core nodes, the market will likely not value Jihan's chain.  But if exchanges are being controlled by the PBoC, that portion of the market will only recognize and value Jihan's chain.
Of course, even in that scenario (PBoC control), such an action by Jihan to split the chain (either by 51% attack or mining a malicious block) will cause severe market decline.  So he won't likely want to do either, but the PBoC might.
For these reasons, I am only somewhat confident in a UASF if the PBoC doesn't control the exchange wallets, and if almost every exchange/service provider/wallet indicates support only for the upgraded Core chain.  In other words, they refuse to acknowledge a "malicious block" or a 51% attack.  I don't think this consent will be hard to get if the PBoC is not in control.
If the PBoC is exercising control of the exchanges (and Jihan), then the best option is a UAHF with an POW algo change--Bitcoin 1.0!!!
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:47:13
Haha.  And that's called unlimited.  Presently, node can't set a limit above 1 MB, because 1 MB is the protocol limit.  BU removes the protocol limit entirely.  Leaving it to the individual policy of nodes is what will guarantee splits on a routine basis (in a decentralized environment).  In a centralized environment, we want see a lot of splits, because Jihan will plan and schedule is block size increase to slowly edge out the competition through resource exhaustion.  He'll be able to do this, because there is no protocol limit.  The protocol limit is what presently prevents him from doing this.  That's why Satoshi put it there.

To clarify, I asked "why is 4 better than the 8 that is in BIP101?"  And you said:

You are advocating for something that you know will cause problems, but are not whole-heartedly advocating for it because
 


So you've said that 2 MB is a better idea than BIP101.  You say:


There is practically consensus for Segwit as a softfork.  To be consistent shouldn't you defer on that issue?  But that's really beside the point.  **Whether you agree there is consensus or not, if Segwit is implemented in the way it is planned, how in the world would it not satisfy your stated first goal of raising the cap to 2MB if we raised the cap by 0.454 MB (your number)?**

I agree that it *should* be.  But as you well know, even if devs code such, the change doesn't actually occur unless the market also overwhelmingly changes.

Risk of what?  A chain split?  We've already had those with BU mining blocks greater than 1MB.  The miner receives no value.  It's not a big deal.  And what happens is the upgraded network ignores that chain and eventually (soon) the chain from the unupgraded miners gets reorged by the miners that actually like getting paid.
From a purely technical perspective, I understand how a fork could result.  But also from a purely technical perspective, I can understand how a fork could occur at any minute.  But once economics are considered, it makes since that such never happens.  The miners don't want a split.  That's why Jihan is threatening to actually attack the old chain in the event of a fork.  But that will definitely result in two chains through a POW change on mainchain and a block size increase on BTUchain.  But that leaves Jihan with the same problem: the network effect is with mainchain.
It's actually pretty simple.  With the exchanges and users behind BIP148, the miners' only favorable outcome comes from complying.  And while Jihan is the influential mastermind, he does not have the influence to lead his group into unilaterally assured destruction.  And that's what all of his options lead to.  The users will be temporarily harmed through market value from uncertainty, but Bitmain will be forever destroyed.

Not everybody was in favor.  Among developers the debate was already brewing.  But among the general community (who mostly listened to Gavin), it was pretty much a foregone conclusion that we would increase the block size cap to scale.  However, this was also well before the Lightning white paper, which suggested another means, and provided just the right amount of ammunition for those who were already concerned about the ramifications of a block cap increase.
That paper was the catalyst that lead to so much strife within the community.  Once that paper was released, Gavin realized his time was short to possibly force a cap increase.  An angry mob was quickly amassed under the cry of "urgency."  The mob felt disenfranchised due to the fact that their perceived only real method of scaling was being subverted by a few developers.  But in reality, among those developers, it was never a foregone conclusion that they could raise the cap indefinitely to scale--a secret they kept quiet due to the harm it could cause to adoption.
Accordingly, the debate was already in progress (just not so public).  This could have been Hearn's way of trying to passively address the debate with the "words" of Satoshi who had already left the scene once he learned that Gavin was cooperating with the CIA.
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:31:45


No they don't.  They are presently coding the lightning network, which will make the currency far more usable than any cap raise can ever allow for.  A cap raise is quickly met by technical limitations that detrimentally harms the network.  No amount of wishful thinking can change that, but building a better payment network can work around it.

8 MB is an explosion in terms of what it will do to propagation times and the network as a whole.  Then it just keeps going up.  Jtoomin, the developer who was one of the biggest proponents of BIP101, gave a talk about it in China with a lot of research that was conclusive that 8 MB can't be handled by the network presently.  4 MB is likely the most, do all things considered he now advocates only 2 MB (ironically Segwit does this).
You, however, are still advocating 8,192 MB hard coded--that's some blind faith.

Unupgraded nodes view SegWit transactions as "anyone can spend" transactions.  But transactions invoking anyone-can-spend UTXOs don't relay through the network, so they can't actually be spent by "anyone."  They can, however, be included in a block that will be recognized by the unupgraded nodes.  But that requires affirmative intent of a miner.  And if the miner does this, the upgraded nodes (including the exchange nodes) won't acknowledge the block--more importantly the reward--leaving no incentive for a miner to actually do this.  But an unupgraded node will recognize the block.
There's a caveat to this though.  Even if the block is picked up by the old nodes, the old nodes will also pick up the block that replaced the malicious block on the upgraded nodes.  But it won't immediately place the new block.  Eventually, however, the old nodes will be reorganized to orphan the malicious block, because there will be more proof of work on the chain that actually gets rewarded.  Because miners like their machines eating electricity and crapping out money, the reorg probably won't take too long on the old nodes.

This part doesn't require a developer to understand at all.  I think under current circumstances, if this thing forks to Classic most of the holdouts will follow, and those who don't will be left holding tokens that the market does not value, but with tokens that the market does value on the other chain.
This fork to Classic is looking imminent.  Yet, most of the Core developers are still arguing about whether we should fork or not, as if they have a choice.  Clearly Core's roadmap is better, but if the chain is going to fork anyway, the better plan is to do what you say can be done: Hardfork SegWit and 2MB while adding the UTXO limits.  If this is done, this Hardfork won't be contentious and it gives Core exactly what it planned for.

That's just not accurate.
Right at the time satoshi introduced the cap gavin wrote to him


Satoshi responded


Even without this, it should be intuitive.  If someone decides to spam the network fees quickly increase for everyone, **including the spammer who is pushing thousands of transactions**.  Accordingly, the quickly rising fees prevent this sort of behavior.  The higher the cap, the less costly it is for them to flood the network with spam transactions.
In September CoinWallet spammed the network.
It was very costly, even though they only used low fees.  Because they used low fees, all that was required for users to get transactions confirmed was that they pay a slightly higher fee.  Since then, most wallets have implemented dynamic fees to deal with this authomatically.  All that happened was, because most of the coinwallet transactions had low fees, they sat in the mempool for a long time.  Had coinwallet actually tried to get all of their transactions confirmed with a competitive fee, it would have cost them a fortune.  And for what?  A short time of clogging the network?  That can't go on forever.
With that explained, I want to stress my original point.  The Core roadmap is better.
1) Segwit (which fixes malleability, and adds scripting function, and just so happens to add about the equivalent of 2MB of capacity)--**this is already coded and has been being tested on a testnet since Dec. 31.  Many of the popular wallets are already working to support it.  It's expected to deploy in about 2-3 months.**
2) IBLT (and other stuff) 
3) then increase cap as needed.

Faction is about data storage and their idea is very cool.  You could use their product in house to keep track of records related to real-estate transactions.  But this does not by any means replace the courthouse.  Due diligence still requires a title search of courthouse records.
I'm not trying to shit on anything, but I know what I'm talking about when it comes to the way real estate transfers and real property law and there are far too many caveats to "replace" the industry as OP said.  But I can't wait for Factom's Merkle tree embedding technology to make electronic record keeping even more verifiable/reliable than even the old hard copy in available method.

There's no hope with that.  Only a few miners actually want BTU.  That's because Divergent Persistence is not a problem when Jihan controls mining--he'll simply schedule well-announced times when he changes block size policy.  Everyone can see this, which is why businesses aren't going to follow, which is why Jihan will never actually do it.

It would, however, be nice, if Jihan actually would start mining larger blocks.  I've been encouraging this for well over a year.

Nobody uses Bitcoin as a unit of account.  Before that happens it must becom a stable store of value and a common means of exchange.  Stability will come with much greater adoption as a store of wealth.  Usage as a means of exchange can come with off-chain transaction scaling solutions.  With these, people could begin to account in Bitcoin rather than fiat.
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:16:01
Segwit adds capacity.  Capacity adds time.  Time allows for Lightning implementation.  Lightning implementation moves many small transactions off-chain.  Taking transactions off-chain reduces capacity requirements.  Reducing capacity requirements adds more time (for 1MB to be suitable).  Adding more time allows for IBLT, weak blocks, pruning etc. to be developed.  These developments make increasing the cap less costly, if needed.
So, while I can argue that the cap could stay at 1MB forever, what I choose to argue is that it can and should stay at 1MB for now while there is no urgency and while better solutions are implemented first.
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:37:31
I can.  But more importantly, I can argue that it can stay for long enough to implement Segwit, which gives an effective cap increase.  That can give time to implement IBLT and lightning network.  IBLT would then allow for cap increases without the immediate detrimental effect.  But with Lightning, we may find that the 1MB cap can stay far longer.

You got it.  And that's the way a soft fork currently works: after enforcement, if a miner mines a non-compliant block, the old nodes will pick it up as valid.  So one way that we have prevented this from happening is by using hashrate as a measure.  But it's not necessary to do so if the economy is behind the soft fork (assuming the miners want to get paid).
One thing is certain though, SegWit will reduce the fees to the miners, so making hashrate a prerequisite to activation will probably never work.  Upgrades that result in less money for miners will always need to be user-driven.

Actually, it's quite to the contrary.  This method needs a higher consensus from the economy.  But since everyone is simply waiting on a couple of miners (who will never agree to lower their fees), it should be no problem.  Keep in mind, this is almost exactly the same type of upgrade that was used to implement P2SH in BIP16.


Nah.  75% or more doesn't even matter without the economy.  The 75% will just switch back once they realize that they are mining fools gold with no value.
No matter the style of a fork, it can't be done without support from the economy.  If there is miner support, then you can be less concerned about having ALL of the economy.  But if there is 100% of the economy, then you don't even have to consider the miners--enough will do what they must to get paid.

You're not thinking things through.  They can't purchase anything with fools gold that doesn't have a market value.  Any chain that goes against the exchanges will survive for about 10 minutes.  The miners work for the market.  They only do this for the market value of their reward.  And the market isn't going to value stolen coins.  That's why miners presently stay in line.  It's why they'll continue to.

It's hard to know where to begin here.  You make several assertions of fact that are just plainly wrong, and almost all of your arguments/understandings are drawn from inferences based thereon.  You are, unfortunately, “showing that you are not educated on this matter and are hoping to get away with simply parroting some talking points.”
I’ll just go down the list.


Clearly, all that is required for those same merchants is that bitpay/coinbase use LN.  This is so obvious that if you were arguing in earnest you would have realized it.  But instead you are approaching this with a kitchen-sink style brain dump without actually considering your position.  Of course, if those businesses want to accept Bitcoin directly, they will need a wallet.  If they wish to use the LN, as I am sure they would, they would need a LN compatible wallet, like everyone.  But still, if they wish to continue accepting Bitcoin via a third party, they only need that third party to have the capability.


It’s hard to take this seriously after the last one.
You say:


Legally? Why?


You are downplaying the role of node operators and miners.  Bitcoin is a financial scheme, and without nodes it could not exist.  There is no reason node operators and miners will avoid regulation while trustless LN node operators fall under the purview of regulators.


Here is a list of Bitcoin nodes with their IP addresses.


I really feel like I’m just doing basic fact checking for you here.  Google can do this for you.


Maybe if it were true, but even then I doubt it.


Mere conjecture on the part of someone who is clearly not knowledgable on the topic.


Bullshit based on misinformation.  You can buy drugs (which I could not give less of a shit about).  The onion routing proposal is more private. I’m certain you just made up the ATM thing too, but I’m not up to speed on that topic (although I can quickly imagine solutions).  But, *ad arguendo*, so what?  The first time Bitcoin purchase would just use the blockchain for confirmation.  No one is talking about destroying the blockchain process.  In fact, it’s essential to LN. 


I have to stop right there, because the rest of the point is bullshit, because this is, AGAIN, filled with wrong facts.
Here is what the white paper says:




be broadcast at a later time. The contracts are enforced by creating a
responsibility for one party to broadcast transactions before or after certain
dates. If the blockchain is a decentralized timestamping system, it is possible
to use clocks as a component of decentralized consensus[5] to determine data
validity, as well as present states as a method to order events[6].


later invalidated, it is possible to create complex contracts using bitcoin
transaction scripts. There has been prior work for Hub-and-Spoke Micropayment
Channels[7][8][9] (and trusted payment channel networks[10][11])
looking at building a hub-and-spoke network today. **However, Lightning
Network’s bidirectional micropayment channel requires the *malleability softfork*
described in Appendix A to enable near-infinite scalability while mitigating
risks of intermediate node default.**
Appendix A goes on to explain how to mitigate transaction malleability.  It’s methods were being worked on in BIP62.  But guess what… Fortunately, Segwit, solves the whole issue.  That’s the idea of Segwit.  And… Segwit brilliantly also makes for a capacity increase.  Win-Win.
With all of that, your already ill-conceived notions about unidirectional channels are null.




Yes it does.  It segregates the witness data from the transaction data.  Only the transaction data gets counted into the block cap size, but the entire amount of data must be downloaded.  It does what Lee is suggesting.


You said you wanted “no artificial barriers.”  Now you say:


We now agree.


What’s the point in arguing about this?  No matter what we conclude, we can’t change it.  It’s, again, like whining about rain outside.  From my perspective, it appears that it is decided by consensus of some combination of node operators, miners, and users, with developers and pool operators having persuasive, but certainly not absolute, influence as experts with that combination of users.  But no matter your perspective the requirement for consensus is built into the model of Bitcoin.  It’s what makes it immutable.  All members of the “bitcoin community” are free to exit if they don’t like its properties.  Additionally, people are free to voice ideas to try to win consensus among the proper group for change.  I have heard lots of voices, and I am persuaded that core has the best plan.  Therefore, because there are many like me, it will be difficult to get consensus for your plan at the moment (especially given that it is predicated on so many false assertions).
This is my first run at this, and I’m not giving a read-through, but I think that literally every one of your arguments/inferences in the previous message was based on a false assumption that could have been easily discovered on your part through slight diligence.  I feel like you are wasting my time, but I have responded because you said, “I'm truly interested to hear your objections on arguments I put about LNs.”
I don’t know where you get your information (have my suspicions), but you are on the wrong side of this.  You need to get on board with the better plan.  If you need to educate yourself better to feel comfortable, then do so, but you aren’t going to gain consensus with frivolous arguments based on false assertions—not from the people who do our homework—the one’s who lead opinions.  Core’s plan is better.  If you had never been exposed to any of this and were asked to choose without bias or prejudice, you would certainly side with core’s plan.  Pride can be a real bitch; it will work to your detriment to protect itself.
“Progress means getting nearer to the place you want to be. And if you have taken a wrong turning, then to go forward does not get you any nearer.

Bandwidth is the first and primary immediate concern.  But storage also becomes a concern.  BIP101 explodes up to 8GB.  Early on its way, storage could easily start to price otherwise-would-be node operators and miners out of the market.
I know you know this, but I want to make sure it's out there for all readers.
Once IBLT is implemented we would still have to consider storage (even after needed bandwidth has been greatly reduced).
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:17:45
Totally agree.  Unreasonable (core is already providing the same capability without a hard fork).
But... IF the users, in concert, are going to do this anyway, it seems that what becomes most reasonable is to hard fork several things in at once.  Could Segwit be added quickly as a hard fork without the capacity increases, but still with scripting abilities (I don't know exactly what I'm talking about here like you do)?  What about Confidential Transactions, could that be quickly added as well?

It absolutely raises the max block size limit.
Block Size  = Transaction Data + Witness Data
This is true with or without Segwit.
Max blocksize limit without Segwit = 1MB including (transaction data and witness data).
Max Block Size with Segwit &gt; 1 MB.  All transactions include witness data.  Under Segwit the cap will count only the transaction data, which could go up to 1 MB, but not the witness data which will necessarily make the max Block Size limit greater than 1 MB




Not under the agreement.  The agreement was that the HF code would allow for a block size of no more than 4 MB.

It's hard to know for sure what he thought, but I suppose he may have thought it would be relatively easy because he did not foresee the good reasons for opposition.  We may never know; he chose to leave.


Who knows?  He needed something to stop a DOS at the time because Bitcoin could not handle the high amount of transactions.  Now Bitcoin still (in its present form) can't handle high amounts of transactions even though the high amounts of transactions aren't coming from an "attack," but regular usage.
You can debate who, but no matter what you conclude a few of them have a veto.


We already have currency that is subject to the whims of people.  It has its benefits.  However, Bitcoin is about removing that power from the hands of people unless all agree (consensus).  It relies on social psychology to do this, but it works.  It makes the supply, ledger, and protocol practically immutable.

I think you are looking at this wrong.
It seems the only material effect of this attack is that it wastes space on 6,000 nodes.  Users with a fee of more than 2 cents were fine.  Increasing the cap would simply allow for more space to be wasted faster, and still at the same cost per kb wasted.
However, in order for this attack to start actually displacing normal transactions the attacker would have to increase their fees by more than 6X.  Of course, then dynamic fee wallets would add a couple more pennies to fees and the attacker would have to respond in kind to continue.  This would continue until the attacker is priced out of the market.
As I understand it, this was one of Satoshi's purposes for the cap; it makes it prohibitively expensive to deny service to users by flooding the network with transactions.

You and I are referencing two different documents.  I am speaking about [BIP 148](  This BIP changes the activation method of SegWit.

Soft forks are backwards compatible.
There is a difference under BIP 148.  The UASF, upon activation requires the miner to signal SegWit support.  But they still do not have to actually produce SegWit blocks.

It's relatively cheap and easy to fill the mempool (thereby taking up any headroom that would otherwise be available in any given block).  It's quite expensive, on the other hand, to actually cause fees to materially rise.
Presently, when people flood the mempool it's not publicized.  But when they first began to do so ("stress test") it was made very public as an attempt to force XT on everyone.
See 
They attempted to prove that a cap increase was desperately needed.  However, what they actually proved was that by raising your fee slightly, it would make their attack too expensive to actually harm the functionality of the network.  **The blocks being full is meaningless if it's not causing fees to materially rise.**  Anyone can inexpensively generate lots of low fee transactions that will take up the remaining space in blocks after transactions with already low, but reasonable fees, are in the block.

Segwit is closer to a long-term solution.  It buys roughly the same amount of time as a mere 2MB (maybe more).  But it also fixes malleability (which helps for building the Lightning Network).  Both will allow time to implement IBLT which would allow for much larger blocks (if needed).  
But Segwit only requires a soft fork (much less risky implementation).  It's also already been decided and deployed on testnet.  And it's expected to deploy in April (probably before a hard fork could be implemented).
As far as long term solutions go, the lightning network could go a very long way towards reducing capacity requirements.  And LN comes at no cost to decentralization by increasing requirements of node operators.

Nope.  Every block mined and relayed under the new rule would backwards compatible with old nodes.  That's a soft fork.  Moreover, the use of SegWit transactions, either by producing them or actually including them in a block, is completely optional under this proposal.  But like all soft forks, after activation blocks mined that don't conform will be rejected.  The only difference is the activation scheme.  Rather than miner activation, it will be user activated.  User activation works when there is an economic majority.


Incorrect.  Transactions that include anyone-can-spend UTXOs as inputs don't relay through the network.  So mining a block that includes one of these would have to be done deliberately by a miner.  A non-mining node couldn't cause this to happen.
Because of this nobody is actually going to support or give value to a chain where a miner has attempted to steel a bunch of coins.  Keep in mind that the miners could do exactly what you are referring to with P2SH transactions.  If anyone ever tried we didn't know, because their attempt was rejected and a non-event.

I rarely see this said, but I've always thought it was self-evident:
Volatility should subside as market cap increases.  Assuming all else is equal, at a $6 billion market cap $10 million worth of value traded will move the market far more (percentage wise) than it would at a $6 trillion market cap.
Moreover, as time passes and market cap increases, assuming it actually does, there should also be an added volatility reducing factor as usage starts to close within systems (e.g.  Business orders parts with Bitcoin from vendor who pays employees with Bitcoin who then purchase final product of the original business).
Volatility has never really bothered me that much.  It does make adoption as a payment means more difficult.  But it really is just a sign that Bitcoin needs to first be more heavily adopted as a store of value before it can be more adequately adopted as a medium of exchange.
This is the way I envision the adoption taking place (again, assuming the stars align just right).
1st) primary adoption as a store of value.
As this occurs then volatility is declining then;
2nd and at the same time) adoption more and more as a medium of exchange, creating a positive feedback loop that leads to greater adoption as a store of value.
As adoption as a store of value occurs even further volatility should decline even more and then;
3rd) the volatility decline leads to more and more usage as a unit of account.  Which in turn leads to even greater usage as a store of value as perceived volatility declines even more.
After a while of this Bitcoin would reach market saturation.  Of course, all of this depends on a lot of things falling into place.

It's pretty basic economics.  Google inelastic supply.  And realize that currently Bitcoin's block space supply is perfectly inelastic.  This is why fees increase so drastically once their is competition to get a confirmation.  Without this mining fees (assuming miners are well-distributed) would be practically zero.  It is a race-to-the-bottom scenario.
BTU is an attempt to convert the block space supply from perfectly inelastic to centrally controlled by a few miners who have won the arms race.

Reasonable minds can differ as to the outcome of SegWit on the revenue to miners.  Hence the split amongst them.  Jihan has additional factors weighing, that settle the difference against SegWit.  He refuses to speak to Core developers.  I will say this, though, this UASF proposal caused him to make an appearance in the Core Slack.  He bluffed to mine malicious blocks if it went through and the next day he finally started signaling for BTU with his own pool.  There's no middle ground.  He doesn't want SegWit and he wants full control of Bitcoin.  BTU is his best hope for that so far.

"one of the most sophisticated exchanges I know has already prepared for such split"
He's talking about the exchange using coin taint to distinguish coins on two different chains in the event he decided to hard fork in an attempt to steal SegWit coins.
I doubt he has that much influence over any exchanges.  But that can change.  And if PBoC controls exchanges, that's worse than Jihan.
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:10:55
No it's pretty simple.  There is a perfectly inelastic supply of block space.  Accordingly, the price increases dramatically once the supply is outpaced by demand.  Hence the huge increase in fees over the last 18 months.
Any material increases in block size (e.g. doubling through SegWit) will result in an equally dramatic lowering in fees.  By definition of an inelastic supply, the volume increase will not make up for the loss in individual fees.
If users want SegWit, they will have to implement it.  Miners will not.

Wrong.  Ridiculously wrong.


Also wrong.  Though I could see why someone might reason this when they don't know how stuff works.


Hence, "isolated theory world"


Obviously, a good attack would do this, but that would be too expensive.  Users (with properly updated wallets) are not displaced unless higher fees are paid by the attacker.  But because that's too expensive, the only material effect is to


The attacker knows this, but to him/her that's fine, because the real purpose was not to actually displace users (although they probably would have liked to); the real purpose for the attack is to frenzy the uninformed into thinking something horrible was happening, then use the mob to push a cap increase.
But most of us are too smart--we recognize that the only bad thing that happens is wasted resources.  And we also recognize that increasing the cap just allows wasting those same resources faster.  Accordingly, there was a panic.  But as usual, the cooler heads prevail.  It is funny, though, that there are some who still have no clue and think the network suffered a horrible attack.
On a side note:  It's absurd that you write with certitude.

It's unfortunate that those acting in good faith may be harmed in this, but picking the winning miner seems counter-productive.  Bitcoin will still be unminable to the masses, and we would only be better off because we have miners we can "trust."  It would seem better for Bitcoin to just reset and restore Bitcoin mining to a decentralized state.  It's unfortunate that good will be harmed, but they assumed the risk.  Moreover, there seems something improper with placing their interests over those of Bitcoin's.

This is incorrect.  The people he is referring to believe in using the *Blockchain* for settlement (not Bitcoin which has multiple meanings), with Bitcoin having an additional (faster, practically unlimited payment system) being built that still uses bitcoin as the primary currency.  The aim is not to convert bitcoin into a currency used for settlements only, but instead to scale Bitcoin by building a payment network that still uses bitcoin (the currency) and settles payments on the blockchain.  This is important to understand because:


Those proposing that Bitcoin should scale with a lightning network do not propose that Bitcoin (the currency) should be used primarily for settlement.  They propose that *blockchain confirmations* should be used primarily for settlement.  That’s because otherwise, if every bitcoin transaction must confirm on the blockchain, we are limited to so few transactions per second (even at 8MB blocks) that Bitcoin won’t scale in usage.  This is true notwithstanding OP’s unsupported and bold assertion that **"It can be done."**


This is an inappropriate comparison.  The US dollar is not a settlement system; It’s a currency that settlement systems settle in.  Gold is not a settlement system.  It’s a currency/money.  The settlement systems are either hand to hand exchange (which can’t be done with Bitcoin because it is not physical), or all of the huge financial industry mechanisms built to transfer these assets.  Bitcoin, however, is both a currency and a built in payment network that handles payments and settles them with blockchain “confirmation.”  The best ideas that presently exist are to still use the Bitcoin payment network and settlement system (confirmation) while adding another payment network that is not limited by the constraints of the legacy.  The latter (lightning network, if you will) will be a payment network, but it will not require confirmation for every payment.  However, users will have the option for confirmation if they so choose.
So this conclusion really is without understanding (or is duplicitous):


The aim should not be to promote the adoption of Bitcoin as a “settlement system” or a “payment system.”  **The aim is to promote Bitcoin as a currency/money** (store of value, medium of exchange, and ultimately a unit of account).  The blockchain with its concomitant payment system (i.e. settlement system) is the first step in that aim, as it provides an immutable record.  This allows for the use of the currency as a store of value and a limited payment system.  The next step to make Bitcoin (the currency) adoptable is to increase the number of payments the system is capable of handling.  This could be done by clumsily increasing the cap, but this comes with costs and still leaves the system too limited for mass adoption.  Or, a new payment network can be built that relies upon the legacy system for it’s settlement properties, but is not constrained by the need to confirm every transaction.  The latter could allow payments that exceed those of Visa, while the former (simply raising the cap limit—even at the most aggressive estimates of what the network could sustain today) will still only allow for 100s—that’s not scalable.  AND it leads to centralization.


Nobody is suggesting that Bitcoin (the currency) should only be used for settlement (as gold was once used only for settlement of USD transactions); what is suggested is that blockchain confirmation should be used for settlement.  Accordingly, those with the idea of building the second, more capable, payment network are, in fact, saying that **they have found a way to have a decentralized cryptocurrency that CAN process a high volume of transactions.**
I have to question Stephen Pair’s motives in this article.  It seems clear to me that Bitcoin has two meanings (Bitcoin the currency and Bitcoin the system), and assuming that he is a smart guy (a reasonable assumption), he must know that he is mixing Bitcoin the system with bitcoin the currency to lead to fallacy.  He suggests that some think that “frequent payments should be assisted by third parties,” and if this is the case, Bitpay would be well positioned to prosper if the Bitcoin payment network were greatly constrained.  Accordingly, it seems that he may possibly be engaging in a bit of doublespeak to say that he wants to see Bitcoin remain decentralized cryptocurrency (while able to handle large amounts of payments), BUT while actually advocating for solutions that will weaken the decentralized nature and still require third parties (Bitpay?) for mass use.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:40:47
He probably does a little of this.  But too many large reorgs are harmful to his business.  It's also risky.  Even with the majority, variance can cause him to lose a string of blocks.  Even if odds are in his favor, sometimes others will solve a block.  And sometimes they will quickly solve many in a row.  Withholding blocks in that scenario costs a lot of money.

This is your problem right here.  Lightning is definitely thought to be a viable solution.  It's as viable as constructing a new building when you have the materials, blueprints, and no-how.  There are three iterations of LN being developed right now the developers communicate with one another to make sure to develop the most compatible system.  The idea really is not much different than other protocols in existence (e.g. smtp, tor, tcp/ip).  It just takes time to build--it's a lot of work.
However, lightning may not work (things don't always work).  If not, the current core plan still allows for a hard fork in the future.  But regardless of whether LN works or not, we know that the network presently can't handle very much addition to a block size.  You can watch toomim's presentation in China and understand this--he was one of BIP101's biggest proponents;now he is asking for 2MB.  In fact, most who initially liked BIP101 are now asking for 2MB.  Fortunately Segwit provides this.  However, **no amount of wishful thinking changes the fact that much more than an increase above that causes problems.**  I don't know what you want to do about that (my children used to whine when it rained).  IBLT could help with the issue, but it is probably more of a vaporware than LN at this point (I don't think of either as vaporware, but it certainly has less work than LN).  But again, it takes time.


I can tell you don’t believe this.  When say “For me” it is like an equivalent of holding the back of your neck, covering your mouth, or shifting your feet.  But if that were not enough, I can tell you don’t believe that because it does not make sense.  If Bobby wants caution, then why risk a hard fork if segwit will do the equivalent and provide other benefits?  Rather than reading into his words in earnest, you are attempting to find another meaning that is more compatible with what you wish his meaning is.  It seems clear to me that he is merely saying he would like to test the waters with a small (up to 2MB) capacity increase.  Segwit does this.


Bitcoin is a lot of things.  Bitcoin is a protocol with a 1 MB cap limit.  This is meaningless, certainly not worth being bolded.  I like to bold in pointers rather than TL;DR.  But this point is useless.


Again, this is like whining about the rain.  There is only so much the network can take.  Obviously the better way to scale involves building a payment network that does not require confirmation for every transaction and does not require every other network participant to process every single transaction.


No it’s not.  Not even for now 


If the cap is removed, the network can be broken; people love to try to break Bitcoin.  The cap was put in by Satoshi to prevent people from breaking it.


This is a bit dramatic.  If the cap is consistently reached, all that happens is fees go up.  You shouldn’t need 6 months if they rise detrimentally high, but even if you do, so what?  Fees are high for that amount of time.  You still can’t make Bitcoin capable of handling more than it can handle.  Again, the obvious solution is not to bother so much with bandaids, but instead to build a payment network that does not require confirmation for every transaction and does not require every other network participant to process every single transaction.  This is already being done.


All correct.  Until IBLT is implemented it is hard to increase the cap because of bandwidth constraints.  Tests show we could handle 2MB.  Segwit will provide this.  Tests show we can’t handle much more, so why are you asking for something in addition to that?


Developers I speak with think much shorter time.  One of the big guys expects to be testing an alpha version in Q1—that won’t be for you or me to test though.  You are making up 4-5 years.  I can’t help you with that.


Those aren’t problems at all.  No more than running a bitcoin node is.  You are showing that you are not educated on this matter and are hoping to get away with simply parroting some talking points.


I have been holding Bitcoin since the summer of 2012.  It’s a significant investment of mine.  I want to prevent you guys from destroying it with short-sighted small-minded notions.  Your ideas are not good.  Core dev ideas are way better.  At this point, most of you have figured this out, but you are still arguing just so you don’t have to face your own impotence.  But what you want is not in the best interest of Bitcoin.  It’s time to get on board with the core plan--the plan you know is better.

Charlie, this will make it clear to you without too much work (just a little).
**Segwit IS a block size increase.**
How is this accomplished without a hard fork?  Well, It's a little trick that has to do with the way old nodes count the size of a transaction.
The transaction format is rearranged slightly:
Currently it is: version input1(utxo1, witness1), input2(...), input3(...), outputs..., locktime
With segwit it becomes: version utxo1 utxo2... outputs... witness1 witness2... locktime
**Understand this:**
Because it was never envisioned that witness data could be moved, the measure of a transaction's size is counted up to the end of the outputs.  By moving the witness data after the outputs, old nodes do not count the witness data in the measurement of the transaction size, but the witness data is still very much a part of the blocks.   **That's what creates the actual block size increase.**  It's not data trimming.  It's simply manipulating the old nodes to not count the witness data, *because it comes after the outputs under SegWit.*
The block size is still transaction data + witness data, but under Segwit, the function that measures transaction size is only counting the transaction data that ends with outputs and it doesn't count the witness data, although it is still very much a part of the transaction.  Therefore under Segwit, the transaction data is limited to 1 MB, but the witness data (for old nodes) is not limited at all.  Under new nodes, however, the witness data is limited under the new block weighting system.

Bingo!  First person to implement a plan to shift incentives away from pools deserves the Nobel prize
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:38:45
After activation/enforcement, all soft-forks reject non-compliant blocks.  But every block they accept is also accepted by old nodes.  A hard fork occurs when un-upgraded nodes reject the new blocks.  See the difference?
BIP148 is just as backwards compatible as all soft forks.  Old nodes will still accept every block propagated under BIP148.  The only difference is the activation mechanism.  Instead of requiring miner signaling, a flag day is set just as was done in BIP 16 when multi-signature transactions were introduced to Bitcoin.


That's just plainly wrong.  You added the word "only."  Just like every other softfork, it's backwards compatible with all unupgraded non-mining nodes.  And just like every other soft-fork, once activated/enforced all miners must comply.
@_date: 2016-01-18 13:51:30
Why are you contending this?  What does it have to do with whether SegWit can scale with a 2MB hard fork?  Just to make contentions?
For the sake of argument, if I agreed with your contention, that doesn't change the fact that Segwit with a 2MB cap will lead to detrimental effects due to propagation delays.  So the question is which should be chosen, SegWit or 2MB?

It's relatively cheap and easy to fill the mempool (thereby taking up any headroom that would otherwise be available in any given block).  It's quite expensive, on the other hand, to actually cause fees to materially rise.
Presently, when people flood the mempool it's not publicized.  But when they first began to do so ("stress test") it was made very public as an attempt to force XT on everyone.
See 
They attempted to prove that a cap increase was desperately needed.  However, what they actually proved was that by raising your fee slightly, it would make their attack too expensive to actually harm the functionality of the network.  **The blocks being full is meaningless if it's not causing fees to materially rise.**  Anyone can inexpensively generate lots of low fee transactions that will take up the remaining space in blocks after transactions with already low, but reasonable fees, are in the block.

That's odd.  SegWit provides ~2MB, fixes transaction malleability, and provides scripting capability.  SegWit is already coded and being tested.

This only works because we have overwhelming consensus from the economy (holders, exchanges, businesses,etc).
Most of the changes have had overwhelming support from everyone.  And once there is that, we send it to the miners to signal readiness.  It's an easy way to do things.  But it is not required.
There are some changes that some miners will never want.  SegWit is an example.  It will result in an immediate fee reduction for miners, so some don't want it.  In that scenario, the users must implement.  There's no way around that.
An activation scheme that does not include the miners requires more certainty that there is user support.  I think we have that with SegWit.  But once exchanges give a show of solidarity, I can't see why we aren't good to go.  Miners can choose to mine against it, but that will be a costly endeavor if there is little market value for their rewards.  **When users pay miners, users define the job.**

I'm going to pretend to speak for Core here.
It's not about calling the community's bluff.  A hard fork is difficult to accomplish, because it's hard to get consensus at once.  Accordingly, the Core team engineered a way to provide what is essentially 2MB without a hard fork through SegWit.  But if consensus is actually forming around 2MB, and Core devs believe that the network can handle 2MB and Segwit (which might not include the capacity increase), then there is no problem with a hard fork.  But who the hell could predict that the community would want a hard fork just to provide essentially the same thing (maybe even less) than a soft-forked SegWit?  But if the community consensus is clearly formed (and I am sure it would be crystal clear with Core on-board), then why not?  Core is not against 2MB, but against the risk of a contentious hard-fork; if there is not contention, then ...

The first car was only 10 mph.  They've gotten much faster, but speed really isn't the focus of most of the manufacturers anymore, as present speeds satisfy the needs of their users.  And there technological and logistical trade-offs for making cars even faster.
We can come up with simple-minded analogies all day long, but those should only be relied upon when there is no real analysis.  Here, there is plenty of analysis, so who cares about our 14.4 modems or the speed of cars?  **Propagation times have been shown to materially delay to the detriment of the network at even modest increases in block size (3 +- MB); nostalgic talk of 14.4 modems does not change that.**

You're calling this a firing of the core, and for many it is.  But for others, it's a succumbing to pressure and misinformation.  For the latter group, they would likely more happily run Core if it had a 2 MB Cap.  Why not adjust the core roadmap to include a 2MB cap, and at the same time fork in Segwit in a manner that does not provide an effective cap increase?  I realize that implementing Segwit as proposed is better because it adds an increase without risking a hard fork.  But if the chain is going to fork anyway, would it not be better and cleaner to implement Segwit in this manner?  And if Core did this, there would likely be many who would opt-out of "firing" the core devs and continue to run the core code.

The technical reasons for Classic are null.  All Classic is planning to do is add support for 2MB.  Core is already doing this (possibly more) with SegWit.  Classic wants SegWit but is going to wait for Core to code it so they can merge it.  The leaders of Classic are doing this at an attempt for power/relevance.

Bitcoin was originally envisioned to be able to succeed if Moore's law sustained.  However, there are developments that make Moore's law irrelevant to the sustainability of Bitcoin--the lightning network.  Moreover, there is no maximum to difficulty (a variable that changes to adjust to hash power on the network), such that if Moore's law sustain, Bitcoin won't be any less secure.  If computers are designed that can quickly solve blocks through some advanced method (e.g. Quantum computers), the mining algorithm can be adjusted accordingly.
The number one question for the sustainability of Bitcoin is how to reward mining without making the currency inflationary and while keeping it lite enough to remain decentralized (therefore immutable).  Core developers have figured out the answer.

I know you are in the loop on these things.  Not only can we not remove the hashpower of this guy, but he has a practical monopoly on ASIC manufacturing and is using his influence from that position to also stop other miners from implementing SegWit.

I don't think a fate is sealed.  Not by a long shot.  Most people, even those who want 2MB would prefer Core to do it.  There is, of course, a mob that is loudly calling for their heads, but I don't think they are representative of the majority of people who want to see 2MB.  Core is clearly fine with 2MB (see SegWit), and I am sure that if a hard-fork is not contentious, then they are fine with the hard fork to implement the same 2MB (assuming SegWit can still be implemented).

You're way off.  Old nodes can't build a block after a hard fork, because they were already forked off the network.  They would have to build on top of a block that they don't recognize.  A hard fork is NOT backwards compatible.


That's called backwards compatible by everyone else.

And it turns out that the longest chain does not have "the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it."
The only way to reconcile that statement is to say that Satoshi was *defining* "longest chain," rather than using the meaning that would ordinarily be assigned to the word longest.  In other words, you have to think that he was defining "longest chain" to mean the chain with the most proof of work invested in it.  In contract construction, you would call this an "ambiguity."
Ordinarily, in interpreting written instruments, the meaning should be determined using only what is within the "four corners" of the document.  However, extrinsic evidence can come in to play if after applying all canons of construction, there still exists an ambiguity.  For the sake of explanation, I'm going to pretend that the other rules don't already resolve the ambiguity (i.e., that we are not able to ascertain the meaning without extrinsic evidence).  When there is such an ambiguity, we determine meaning by considering party behavior.
In this instance, Satoshi actually coded rules that would follow the chain based on its length.  As a result, the chain with "the greatest proof-of-work invested in it" could actually rejected.  Because of that error, the code was changed to no longer consider the length as representing the most work.  Now there are other measures to determine such.  Accordingly, the ambiguity is resolved.  He was not defining the words "longest chain."  He was using their ordinary meaning and incorrectly thought that the longest chain would represent the chain "which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it."
You keep insulting me, and I keep responding graciously.  I am interested in propagating truth, and that requires teaching.  But your persistence will seem stupid to practically all readers.  The truth is that Satoshi made errors, and that's okay.  He was just a smart guy trying to express a pretty good idea that began a whole new area of study and development.

Segwit increases bandwidth requirements just as increasing the cap does.  There is only so much increase that the network can take without problems.  Toomim's tests show (creator of Classic) about 3-4 MB, which is why you all of the sudden see an about face on BIP 101 and a push for 2MB (which was ridiculed last year when Peter Todd first suggested it).
Accordingly if you implement Segwit and have a 2MB cap, then the effect is a cap increase of 4-8MB (8MB with 100% max Segwit efficiency, which probably won't happen, but we could certainly see 6MB, especially if someone is attacking the protocol).  This type of bandwidth requirement is too much for the network.  Which is why Core's roadmap is to implement Segwit first, then IBLT, then look at a cap increase.  IBLT will greatly reduce the amount of bandwidth required to propagate blocks, thereby making a cap increase actually feasible beyond the current limitation.

This is true only in isolation and in extremes.  But it is also true that it is in the miner's interest that Bitcoin remain decentralized.  However, because of the "tragedy of the commons" type situation from mining, miners tend be unwilling to give too much individual opportunity cost to protect the better interest of a their investment by protecting the interest of Bitcoin.  However, as you point out, the opportunity cost is only "slight."  And choosing the lower hash power pool is as easy as choosing the higher, and it "helps" Bitcoin.  The opportunity is practically negligible.  Accordingly, it would seem that many miners who are not acting in isolation, but with some consideration of the bigger picture, determine that with only a slight opportunity cost, promoting the health of the Bitcoin economy is in their best interest.
You can see this effect in other tragedy of the commons type scenarios.  For instance, people aren't usually that willing to go too far out of their way to recycle.  But they'll go a little out of their way because it's presumably "good for the planet."  If blue trash cans are provided with a label, the hassle (cost) becomes so slight that they will endure it to help the planet, even though they realize that their little contribution is practically meaningless.
It seems the same would be true with miners.  The benefit of 26% over 23% is so slight that the contribution to the Bitcoin health (even though seemingly insignificant) becomes more valuable.

Another way to kill two birds with one stone is to Hard Fork 2MB and at the same time Segwit.  This would be a cleaner way to add Segwit.  Also, adding Segwit does not have to include the data increase (Toomim has suggested that it should not).
Obviously, Core's initial plan is the more reasonable plan as it avoids a risky hard fork.  **But if there IS going to be a hard fork** (notwithstanding what is best), doesn't hard forking Segwit in (maybe even Confidential Transactions too) at the same time make the most sense?  It's two birds with one stone and only one fork which is going to happen anyway (not saying that I think it is definitely going to happen--just hypothetical IF).

When supply outpaces demand, there is practically no fee revenue for miners.

Liquidity requires a ready market with a quick method of valuation.  One way of providing a quick method of valuation is to provide a fungible asset.  An evaluation for one becomes an evaluation for all.  Another way is to provide simple assets like annuities that can be evaluated with mathematical functions.
Colored coins don't make real estate easier to evaluate, therefore don't help with liquidity.
You're claiming that a colored coin could be used to represent title.  But then how is record publicized without some records keeping entity?  You may know that the holder of that token is the owner, but how do you know who the holder is?  Public records reflecting title to land is essential to our legal system.


How is the buyer going to have a warranty, or a special warranty?  How Am I going to stipulate that one of those properties is never going to have a gas station on it?  The negotiable agreements to transfer property are not going to be expelled just because of "colored coins."

SW already has overwhelming consensus and does not need it for a soft-fork.  A hard fork has never had consensus--there certainly won't be consensus if Segwit is not implemented, when it could be.

You got it wrong.  There are only two ways a split can occur under this plan. (1) miners could hard fork and reject SegWit blocks.  (2) miners could intentionally spend SegWit transactions which show up as anyone-can-spend to old nodes (malicious blocks).  The former would be handled just like it would under a BU fork right now.  It's not a big deal if miners decide to hard fork.  So the only question is how to deal with the latter.
The way to deal with the second problem is by making sure that exchanges won't recognize a block that spends anyone-can-spend transactions.  This is done if all of the exchanges simply implement this BIP.  It should be pretty easy to get exchanges to do this.  After all, any miner that tries to spend those coins is stealing.  But if a miner actually decides to try to steal those coins, there will be a chain split.  **But here's that miner's problem:** because the exchanges will ignore that block, the miner gets a reward with zero value.  Not many miners will want to try that.  There is a second problem for a miner trying to do this; they have to fear the harm they could cause to the market they rely on.  No miner with substantial interest will do this.  Moreover, they won't even build on top of a block that does this.
For these reasons this BIP16 style soft fork  will work with &lt;50% of the miners if the exchanges are on board.  But they are not asking miners to actually agree to mine SegWit transactions.  They are simply asking them not to mine on top of a block that spends the anyone-can-spend transactions.  But if the exchanges are on board, "asking" is just being polite--the miners would have to be suicidal to actually try it.

That's not a distinction.  They can also plan an attack on the new chain if you wait.
The truth is, the defense isn't easy.  And it gets more difficult the greater the network effect the old chain has.  Waiting weakens the effect of the "easy" defense.  It's why we are stuck with government controlled fiat.  It's why it's damn near impossible to defeat facebook when nearly everyone uses facebook.
The best time to deploy the defense is before the network effect is too powerful.  Which is why the powers that be will wait before they exercise their control.
By the time they finally do exercise control, switching from Bitcoin to Bitcoin 2.0 (or whatever we want to call it) will be even harder than switching from fiat to Bitcoin currently is.
The attack is the ability to control.  Once that is done only time is preventing the exercise of that control.  Eventually the benefit of exercising control will outweigh the ever-declining cost of doing so.

The website says you plan to make real estate "liquid."  How?  Real Estate is not fungible, which is essential to a high to degree of liquidity in an asset.  If you somehow relate the holder of a token (colored coin, etc.) to the title holder of real estate.  How does that make it liquid?
It seems to me that all it does is cloud title.  How does a title examiner discover ownership?  How does the utility company purchase an easement?  It would seem that in order to even effect the relationship between a coin and title, there would have to be a deed of property into an entity and then a contract and a trust relationship between the "owner" and the company that would be legal title holder that is also responsible for tracking coin ownership.  But what is the point of that?  Now if the utility wants an easement they would have to get it from that company rather than the owner.  But if the coin is freely exchanged on the blockchain, then how does the record keeping entity even know who the owner is?  If they don't know who the owner is then how do they collect for property taxes, etc.

SW has the requisite consensus needed for implementation in all material nuances of the word (core dev consensus, emergent consensus, concurrent consensus, simultaneous consensus, blah blah whatever you want to call it) and a hard fork to increase the cap has never had the requisite consensus (and those are different)  for implementation.
You want to use Segwit as a bargaining chip, but Core devs don't need anything you can offer in order execute their well-thought-out plan that has the support of all material players--even those that would like an additional cap increase.  A reasonable person in your position would recognize that it is time to concede, but most of you in those "other forums" have decided instead to treat this like banana time in the monkey cage.

He doesn't want to "attack" the network.  (At least not yet.)  He wants to capture it.  BU better enables this in at least two ways.

Second, he can use BU to block SegWit in an attempt to keep all transactions on chain where they must be approved by him for a fee.

This is becoming such a strange conversation.  But anyway, miners can rationally decide to join the pool with the lower hash even when the pools have no material differences, because there are other considerations.  Particularly, there is some individual value (even if little) to supporting Bitcoin as a whole by diversifying the hash power.  So if they find that value to be higher than the practical negligible cost of using a pool with a slightly lower hash and it is not too burdensome to do so, it is rational (even reasonable) to join the slightly lesser pool.

So you would want a risky hardfork for a mere 0.25 MB when you could simply softfork Segwit in?  I've been told that almost all developers believe that SegWit is better implemented as a softfork, and that's just on its merits, not considering the risk of a hardfork (I'm not a developer).  Doesn't that seem superfluously risky for something that may give no extra benefit and marginal benefits at best?
A softfork SegWit implementation gives as much time (maybe more) than a 2MB hardfork.  During that time IBLT can be developed to make a cap increase less detrimental.  Also during the time IBLT is being built someone could probably hammer out a complete dynamic cap solution that would make it so that there is only one hardfork ever needed.  I cannot fathom a technical reason that it is better to hardfork a cap in now, especially for 0.25 MB.
However, I will concede, that if it is going to hardfork regardless with overwhelming support, I would be okay with a SegWit implementation that somehow limits data requirements (if it does not limit the capabilities).  But I have conflicting information as to whether this is possible or not.  Regardless, it's just stupid that we would do this rather simply implement SegWit in a softfork--which is far easier, less risky, and provides the exact same benefits.  The only reasons to take such a useless risk are political and not technical.

The same would result if they were running Core 0.12.1.  This is true with all soft forks: the miners must upgrade or be forked off the mainchain.  And no miner wants to be forked off mainchain when the economy values the tokens on mainchain.
The only difference in BIP148 is simply the activation method. Instead of miner signaling (which is clearly never going to happen when there will result an immediate fee revenue decline), the activation method is a flag day.  In order to do this, we simply need exchange/user support.
Of course, like always, miners can choose to fork off.  There is no force behind this.  But like always with Bitcoin, there is a bit of a coercive effect that keeps miners from doing so: they like being rewarded with tokens that actually have market value.

It fails every time the market is close to a break even split on what the size should be.  Unreasonable block sizes can only be introduced by the extremely large miners.  But in a decentralized market an unreasonable block size will never succeed.  Splits occur, however, when reasonable minds differ at close to 50/50.  That's a guarantee.
In our current state, with almost complete centralization and a monopolized ASIC market, what we'll see is a slow move towards forced unreasonable block sizes that wipe out competition through resource exhaustion.

The mining arms race is about domination.  Jihan has won the race so far through monopolizing ASIC production.  BU will allow him to drive out any competition for control or for mining rewards.  It's very much in his favor, but against the best interest of all other Bitcoiners.
Bitcoin is designed around the idea that miners will be selfish.  This works well when  mining is highly decentralized, but not so well when one wins the arms race.  Under ordinary commerce, antitrust laws would prevent such.  But this is Bitcoin, so we must wait until competition emerges.  Jihan can't wait, so he is urgently pushing for the advantage he needs to prevent that competition from emerging.

Armstrong is hard headed.  I'd say he's come around, but he still has a lot of maneuvering to do to save any face from his previous political blunders.  It's probably still in his best interest to remain a bit neutral.  But within six months, he needs to look like a new man.
@_date: 2016-01-23 03:54:07
I doubt he's guided by avarice as much as ambition.  He usually takes a neutral "catch-all" position to avoid standing on conviction, which might alienate.  Maybe he's afraid of losing his spot at the head table if he spoke his mind?
I'm for moderate temperament, but this is often just a masquerade for cowardice.  Since the debate was taken to the community Andreas has offered no leadership.  I suspect that this is because he fears the possible repercussions--it's too important that everybody likes him for being above-it-all.

Of course "easy" is a term that requires relativity or degree to have meaning; without relativity it could be argued endlessly.  But transporting $100k worth of gold requires carrying a 5 pound weight.  This is certainly easier than transporting $100k in heads of cattle.  But Bitcoin is even easier than this (as is paper).

Wasn't me.  But one of the beauties of Segwit is that it can be soft-forked.  Plus, as Luke-Jr noted, most in the know say it's more cleanly implemented as a soft fork.
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:08:19
I'm all good with SegWit.  I'm just pointing out that activation is going to have to be done by the miners.  And FWIW I don't believe that a 2.1mb block size will necessarily result in a sudden price rise.  It might.  I suspect the market most likely wouldn't care in the short term.  Regardless, Jihan doesn't want SegWit, so users have to do it and quit rewarding him if he doesn't perform the task assigned.

No need to unless this guy starts to exert control over exchanges.  Of course, if the PBoC implements some sort of mandatory custodial service for their exchanges, then an algo change may be the only option.  But this would result in two chains.  And you can bet that the PBoC exchanges would not support the chain with the algo change.
@_date: 2016-01-18 18:08:51
2MB is a can kick of the exact same distance (maybe less).  There is no technical reason to prefer 2MB over a SegWit soft fork.  Either kicks the can far enough to develop IBLT which will allow for even bigger blocks.  SegWit soft forked comes with added benefits and less risk in implementation.
It's an old cliche that you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink.  Clearly the Core roadmap is the better plan, but the community can reject it for something it knows is not as good.  That's dumb though.

Not if PBoC ends up controlling exchanges to the point where they are not allowed to choose implementations that will enhance privacy (SegWit).  For instance, the PBoC could require a mandatory custodianship for the exchanges (this has been discussed).
If that happens, Jihan is not bluffing.

Reading this, it seems that this will somehow activate SegWit on all Core nodes with versions &gt;= 0.13.1.  It was my understanding that before recognizing SegWit, those nodes required &gt;95% of mined blocks signaling readiness in a 2016 block difficulty period.
Because of this BIP, I am guessing that there is another means of activating in 0.13.1-0.14.0.  Can someone chime in (perhaps u/luke-jr)?

That's not true with Divergent Persistence.  When there is roughly equivalent hash power and market share in disagreement over the best block size policy, the two will diverge into separate chains indefinitely.  And while they are separate, lots of bad things happen with replay and double spends.
Edit:  To be clear, I'm not talking about a fork to BTU.  I'm talking about what happens under Emergent Consensus systems.  What I am referring to is not a problem under Bitcoin, because block size is a protocol limit.  **Divergent Persistence** becomes a huge problem under Emergent Consensus, because the block size limit is removed from the protocol and left to individual node policies.  Inevitably, the chain will diverge every time there is close to equal disagreement on the appropriate policy--that's just one of many reasons why block size a protocol limit.
@_date: 2017-03-05 16:44:35
Well.  The PBoC has just co-opted all of the Chinese exchanges.  It is yet to be seen what their plan is.  But there is speculation that it involves a mandatory custodianship. 
It should be easy to figure out that the PBoC is not going to support or even acknowledge privacy enhancements to the protocol.  And with Jihan being with their jurisdiction, he'll do as he's told.
Here's the real bitch of it.  The price will likely rise as all of this occurs, because the PBoC will be welcoming their population to use Bitcoin as a secure store of wealth and trade vehicle (supported by the government).  Of course, they know that they control it.
But if the PBoC doesn't control the exchanges (or stop SegWit deployment thereon), then Jihan will have no leverage.

Is core looking to agree to a hard fork to 2 with Segwit included?  IF it's going to fork anyway, this seems like a cleaner plan than soft forking Segwit with the increase.
@_date: 2017-03-05 20:16:52
Hmm...  So we really need about 75% of miners to agree not mine on top of a malicious block, not necessarily to agree to mine SegWit blocks.  They could do this by filtering through an upgraded Core node (what I gather people are calling a border node, which they are already using)??
Also, we need practically all of the exchanges to reject a chain built on malicious blocks.
If we had those two things, would it seem less likely to cause a market destroying split?
Also, wouldn't causing such a split have to be done by people who we would be destroyed by the market response to such?

Potential conflict disclosed.  Reasonableness requires more scrutiny of their actions.  However, I see no problems with Blockstream's actions.
Blockstream is manifestly interested in perfecting Bitcoin and is actively doing so--all businesses in this space should be doing so.  That they wish to profit by selling their expertise to help others interact with the blockchain is noteworthy, but not suggestive of self-dealing.
Blockstream may be the best advocate Bitcoin enthusiasts have had (whether they realize it or not).  Had it not been for some in Blockstream's development team, Bitcoin likely would have headed down a path of centralization.  They have shown time again to have better ideas.
We should be more concerned about those who are not disclosing their affiliations.

As someone very familiar with this (and also loves Bitcoin), Bitcoin can do very little for real estate titles.  What if I want to reserve minerals?  What if I want to grant an easement?  What if I want to grant an undivided interest in the south 10 acres lying between the oak tree and the pond?
Real estate title needs a lot of words and it's not feasible to make title uniform (fungible).  However, people have made mortgages uniform and kindof fungible.  They have done this to make a national mortgage registry.  You file a mortgage assignment to the national register in your local courthouse, then the national register keeps up with ownership.  I suppose you could use blockchain technology for this, but I doubt anyone really sees an advantage to decentralization of the records.

I don't necessarily agree with this statement, but for the sake of argument, let's say avoiding a fee market is the aim.  Segwit does this.  It's expected to be implemented in about 2 months (already deployed on a testnet with major wallets supporting the change).  It will give the equivalent of a roughly 2MB cap  and provide other great benefits (transaction malleability fix, ways to make other upgrades like possibly confidential transactions).
But there is a limit to how much we can raise the cap (as shown by Toomim's research, which is why they quit asking for BIP101) without serious detriment to the network.  A 2MB cap with Segwit is likely to be too much data throughput for the network to remain properly synchronized (which is very important).
Make no mistake, this is a mob.  They want what they want.  For the couple of developers pushing it, it's about power that the mob could give them.

Oh no.  Don't hear me saying they won't list BTU.  I think they will.  At the bare minimum, they will allow withdrawals of BTU (assuming they know how to distinguish the chains).
But if a split occurs due to the mining of a malicious block, I don't think the exchanges are going to acknowledge that block which will eventually get orphaned in a reorg.

**Follow that same thread out (anyone who wants to understand this should!)** and you see that Toomim says with Segwit at 50% adoption (as toomim speculates) all that would be required to reach a 2MB equivalent is a 0.454 MB additional cap increase.
Me to toomim:


Toomim to me:


End edit
Of course, those who don't adopt will pay higher fees per transaction (I think), so considering that wallet developers want people to use their wallets, I can't see why all wallets won't begin to incorporate Segwit, making the cap increase required even less.
So to reach Bobby's ideal, with Segwit we are talking about something like 0.454 MB or less.
But really, isn't 2MB kindof arbitrary?  If it's a little more or a little less wouldn't Bobby be satisfied?
Edit:  It would require only a 0.143 MB cap increase to reach Bobby's ideal if there is 100% Segwit adoption (using Toomim's number).  If there were some using Segwit to its fullest capacity (15 of 15), we might not even need a cap increase to reach Bobby's ideal.

Do you think we are in the blind?  People speak with miners.  We know exactly why they aren't switching:  Jihan of Bitmain has practically monopolized ASIC manufacturing and he is controlling most of the pools signaling for BTU.  And for some of the pools that aren't signaling, he threatens to quit selling them equipment if they start signaling SegWit.  This is simply how it is.
Another reason there is reluctance to signal SegWit is because it will drastically lower their fee income.  Any change that does this should always be user-activated.  We shouldn't expect miners to just acquiesce to lower fees.

But stocks are liquid already.  They are liquid partly because there is an active market, but more importantly because securities are fungible.  Putting references to electronic records as a token on a blockchain seems to me to do nothing for fungibility of real estate.  It also seems to do nothing for the marketability of real estate.  At best, if you use THE blockchain, the token will provide proof that the records existed at a certain time.  But this is not a problem hindering the liquidity real estate (in practice it's not a problem at all).
I don't know what you're really up to, but with that answer I am certain you won't make real estate liquid.  It still seems like you are slinging buzzwords.

Moore's law is mere extrapolation.  If you are relying on it, you are relying on wishful thinking.  Computer speed growth has already fallen short of Moore's "law" since Bitcoin's inception.  Relying on Moore's law is a lazy approach to a problem that requires real analysis.  The only reason to rely on it is if there is no other way to scale.  In that case you are still taking a huge, but unfortunately necessary, risk.

It hasn't reached limits where it becomes detrimental to block propagation times.  This is so obvious that it has to be disingenuous.  It ignores the fact that at higher than a few megabytes it does detrimentally affect block propagation times.


No there's not.  Market forces can drive a miner to produce larger blocks that take longer to propagate while they get a jump start on the next block, then the next....  And this assumes actors simply following the rules in "good faith."  What about the market incentives of an entity (e.g. the federal reserve) that may wish to destroy Bitcoin to protect a greater investment.  It's silly.
**Coinbase is best positioned to prosper if scaling does not include de some sort of lightning network.  Coinbase would prosper well if day to day usage of Bitcoin required some centralized third party intermediaries to handle most of the transactions off chain.  Coinbase could become the modern bank/payment processor.  Accordingly, Armstrong may be motivated by what is in Coinbase's interest, notwithstanding the fact that Coinbase's interests are not aligned with Bitcoin's on this particular matter.  These weak, easily dismantled arguments, suggest ulterior motive.**

It's hard to say.  I can explain his actions as being aligned with an opposing interest (like government).  But I can also explain his actions by self-interest.
It makes sense for him to attempt to co-opt Bitcoin, and a bug-free BTU is a great way to do that.  The idea behind BTU (emergent consensus) only works when miners are colluding well beyond 50% of the hashrate and can well-organize and announce their planned changes (like the FED).
I could simply see him trying to place himself in this position and use it to slowly push out his competition through resource exhaustion while also maintaining fees where he likes.  That requires no ulterior motives beyond self-interest.  But I still can't help but suspect he's serving other interests as well.

First, you don't speak for "the miners."  Second, and with that said, I'm saying that you are wrong.
There is no covenant to produce code by July, 2016.  The covenant is to produce code within three months of a specific condition precedent--a Segwit release--which triggers the duty.  The mention of July serves only to forecast a timeline if the condition precedent to the duty occurred in April, which the parties forecasted to be "likely."  Until the condition is met, the duty is not owed.

No it doesn't.


Actually, once you have exchange support, if there happens to be a chain split, the reward for the unupgraded miner will be worthless.  It won't even be considered Bitcoin.  I don't know how in the world you expect that to get a majority of hashpower behind it.  We've already seen a similar split with BTU miners producing blocks &gt; 1 MB.  They quickly just get reorged, because even the BTU supporting miners won't mine on that chain, because they like money.


Nope.  This is the same as any soft fork.  With all soft forks, if a miner refuses to upgrade and produces a block compatible with the old nodes, but incompatible with the upgraded nodes, the old nodes will follow.  But they quickly get reorged as the other miners refuse to build on top of the chain in order to get a reward of actual value.  But the fact that the old nodes will accept either chain is in itself an acknowledgment that the upgraded chain is backwards compatible.

The supply is still inflating, but at half the rate.
But if by deflation you mean the value of the currency is rising, then the halving might (should theoretically) cause this.  That's only because the market of potential Bitcoin holders is not even close to fully saturated.  However, if Bitcoin had been completely adopted and used by the world at its full potential, it would be characterized as inflationary.  The distinction is that its inflation schedule is completely known and not subject to change with the hearts' of a few.
To characterize Bitcoin as deflationary is like characterizing gold as deflationary if gold were just now being adopted as a store of wealth.  As a greater percentage of the population starts using it, of course, the value will increase, but this increase has little to do with supply changes, and therefore, it seems a bit inappropriate to characterize the change as a result of deflation (which suggests changes in the supply).

The important number is the last one on the page, which shows that we are at 96.3% CSV since the last difficulty adjustment period.
CSV only has a chance to lock-in at difficulty changes.  Presently there are only 277 blocks remaining until the next difficulty adjustment and only 87% of those need to signal CSV to lock it in.  We need only 240 more CSV signaled blocks in this period.

If it does, miners can manually/individually implement.  While the hard-coded consensus limit is at 1MB, the code used to (actually still does) come with a default settings individual limit of 750 kb.

To compare Ver with President-elect Trump is ridiculous.
Ver is a joke.  There is probably no better person to be leading that "movement."


His rhetoric--no exaggeration--is quite persuasive against his goal.  He is not a good speaker.  He's not even all that smart.  He is just an opportunist.  And the opportunity he is taking is a chance to boost his status.  He does not care about anything else.  All of his "goals" are derived from political calculations.  He does not care about censorship (he censors) and he does not care about BU (it's half-assed).  He chose to champion these things to win political clout from a dwindling minority (he thought they would grow).
If he were smarter and more charismatic he could have better seized the opportunity.  But because he is somewhat dense and definitely awkward, he is actually bringing his "causes" down with him.

Multiple nuanced definitions of "philosophy."  A Ph.D in Computer Science should have a very philosophical understand of the disciplines behind Computer Science.  They don't just know how things are done, they should know why things are done from the most basic levels to very advanced levels.
From dictionary.com
1. the rational investigation of the truths and principles of being, knowledge, or conduct.
2. any of the three branches, namely natural philosophy, moral philosophy, and metaphysical philosophy, that are accepted as composing this study.

That's great and all.  But Bitcoin really aims at central banks, not local banks.  It's more about supply of money over fees associated with transaction of money.  But if it can help with both, awesome.  But we never sacrifice the things that protect the supply in order to "beat" the banks on their fees.

Fair enough.  But I don't necessarily think the Bitcoin protocol has solidified.  I kindof hope it has, but I'm cool if SegWit gets implemented.  Also, I think that trusted off-chain payments systems can make Bitcoin viable for daily payments.  So in that regard, maybe naming the decimal places will one day be needed.  But this won't be needed until goods are priced in Bitcoin.  And that won't happen until Bitcoin has become fairly stable.  Stability requires much more capital adoption.
To focus on naming small denominations creates the false impression that we are about to actually use that denomination.  But the reality is that we may never, and if we do, it will probably take a long time before Bitcoin is stable enough to be used as a unit of account.
@_date: 2017-01-08 14:40:20
This is a complete waste of time that has such a scammy feel to it.
People rarely use Bitcoin for everyday purchases.  But when they do, the purchased goods are denominated in fiat and then converted to Bitcoin by software.  The market cap is orders of magnitude away from providing the stability to actually use Bitcoin as a standard unit of account.
I have not met anyone who doesn't get the very simple concept that bitcoins are divisible.  Bitcoin is by far the most valuable cryptocurrency.  Its price should reflect that.  If all of the sudden everything were priced in smaller units, Bitcoin gains the first impression of a cheap penny stock.

Seriously, though, this push to name the denominations is a wasted effort.  As Bitcoin gets adopted, people won't be using it to send 100 Satoshis.  Bitcoin is not appropriate for lots of small transactions (at least not on chain).  People aren't going to be using Bitcoin to make coffee purchases.  They are using it to store wealth.  And for that people want to know the value of a whole Bitcoin.
Everyone tried this naming thing in 2013-2014.  It doesn't matter and kindof feels scammy.
Presently, if people are using Bitcoin for small payments, the site they use denominates in a fiat, then a link converts to Bitcoin amount right before payment.  The nomenclature for the Bitcoin decimals is totally useless to those users.
The market cap is orders of magnitude shy of supporting the stability required to even start denominate prices in Bitcoin.  And if that market cap is ever achieved, unless off-chain methods are developed, the fees for small transactions will make small transactions too costly.

**First.**  The secondary advantage of capacity increase is roughly what Bobby Lee is presently asking of (along with all who are asking for 2MB).
**Second.**  What makes you think blocks will be full in six months with Segwit?  If most adopt it (and some adopt it to its fullest 15 of 15 savings), that gives an equivalent cap increase of almost 2MB (which is what most, like Bobby, are asking for).  I expect most people to adopt it because it fixes transaction malleability (among other things, like possibly allowing for confidential transactions) and will lower fees for the same transaction.  Those who don't use this fee saving/fraud-preventing upgrade will likely have their transactions viewed with suspicion (why not save money unless you are considering fraud?).  Accordingly, most wallets will quickly implement--many are already working with devs on segnet.  This setup is a formula for high level adoption, therefore an effective cap increase to about 2 MB (Again, I'm assuming that at least some small percentage will take full advantage of the 15 of 15 Segwit to save maximum fees).  Of course, if Segwit transactions were not quickly adopted fee pressure would further incentivize adoption--users can pay lower fees by segregating their witnesses.  So, I don't see any real fee pressure building until Segwit is widely used and can't relieve any more pressure.  However, even with that, for the reasons above, I expect Segwit transactions to be widely used before fee pressure builds with no outlet other than higher prices.  Accordingly, once deployed, the effect on fees will practically immediately be like having roughly a 2MB cap.
With a 2MB cap, it seems to me that once deployed it will take longer than six months to fill that 2MB.  Average block size is still only about .8 MB after seven years.  I realize that transaction volume might be extrapolated to grow exponentially for a time, but even with that, what reasonable extrapolation makes us fill an additional 1.2 MB in just 6 months.  More reasonable extrapolation should put us past a year for more fee pressure.
**But to your question**.  


Assuming we agreed on time, when fee pressure builds I would probably start looking into full Segwit fee savings (by using a 15 of 15 method).  This would reduce my fee even further, and if everyone does this, it will provide even more relief.  Then..., when that is no longer available I will of course pay higher fees *if I want quick confirmation.*  It seems reasonable to expect that by this time IBLT will be implemented.  IBLT would allow for a cap increase without affecting propagation times to the detriment of the network.  However, it may be determined that a cap increase is really not necessary to reduce fee pressure because a lightning network implementation has greatly reduced on-chain transactions.  But if a LN fails, and fee pressure is building and there is no better way to scale, then I would not oppose slow cap increases so long as it is determined the network can handle it (which is far more likely with an IBLT implementation).
@_date: 2016-01-18 01:17:04
What I meant was DOSing the network.  Someone simply pushing the network beyond its limits for the purpose of breaking it (people love to do this with Bitcoin.  There was the guy "stress testing" back in September, and then there is amlicin who keeps trying to break Bitcoin).
But yes, also a miner wishing to get a jump on the next block could intentionally create high bandwidth requirements so that other miners are not aware of the block being found before the first miner is partially finished solving the next block.  This would lead to more orphaned blocks and substantially decreased network reliability.
The biggest "slow connection" problem is the link between the Great Firewall and the rest of the world.  But IBLT would completely change the way blocks are propagated.  Instead of requiring each node to download all of the transactions within the block, because most nodes have already had all of the transactions already stored in their mempools, the nodes will instead only download a list of transactions included in the block and then will actually build the block themselves, only downloading missing transactions from connected nodes.  Implementing IBLT will so greatly reduce bandwidth requirements for block propagation that an additional cap increase would not be expected to cause the same detrimental effect.
So, because there is a choice between one or the other, the condensed version of Core's roadmap looks like this.
1) Segwit (which fixes malleability, and adds scripting function, and just so happens to add about the equivalent of 2MB of capacity)
2) IBLT (and other stuff)
3) then hard fork as needed.

If you run a Core node, you can point Breadwallet to that and still be safe.
Otherwise, if a non-replay B2X fork occurs, it's probably best not to receive transactions using Breadwallet.  At least until they address the issue.  Any incoming transactions should be with a wallet that explicitly follow the real Bitcoin chain.  A Core node can do this.  GreenAddress will also follow the real chain.  I'm sure there are more.

I know of a group of people who you misguidedly hate who are aiming for even better mining decentralization than that (500+).
But rather than solo mining, it could be done with P2Pool.  Presently, there is not a method for making P2Pool more efficient Stratum.  But... there is a way to make it equally efficient (design is in progress).  And with a political push, switching to P2Pool could greatly alleviate the political threat posed by person-controlled pools.  Compact Blocks has gone a long way towards this (killing the advantage of the relay network).
Now this doesn't stop the problem that a couple of ASIC manufacturers have achieved an advantage.  But this can probably be solved with normal market competition.  Hopefully, in time, there can be many multiple manufacturers all in an arms race with practically equal capabilities.  They can even become commoditized.

I welcome a 2X split.
I have been in this fight since the early days of Gavin taking it public.  Without any hesitation, I can say that the original Classic had a far better chance of succeeding than any other threatened hard fork.  And 2x is not even close to having the requisite momentum.
Originally, the goal of any threatened hard fork was to avoid a split entirely by winning the requisite consensus to make the original chain die.  2x didn't have this before BCH.  And afterwards it is even less appealing to people whose businesses and livelihoods depend on not fucking up Bitcoin.  They are no longer under any delusion of control.  2x will flop if it is even attempted.
Of course, none of the people who have been around for a while are under any similar delusions that we could somehow stop people from creating all sorts of splits.  **But we now have shown that we can stop these people from doing what counts as success--scamming their way into usurping our hard-earned network effect and market value.**  They will have to earn it just like any other altcoin.
Bcash had the best chance at this simply by being the first to try.  Now much fewer will be susceptible.  2x is DOA.
But like I said, I welcome 2x just like I have for years welcomed these attempts.  In fact, the more spinoffs the better.  Each spinoff will further solidify the notion that there is only one true Bitcoin, diluting any chance of any scammy spinoff confusing newcomers.

It's funny isn't it?  So many want to proclaim the underlying "blockchain" tech while dismissing Bitcoin.
In the white paper Satoshi Nakamoto didn't once mention "blockchain" or "block chain."  He did, however, write of chaining blocks of transactions together.  But why?  Why have "blocks" of transactions rather than just transactions added to the distributed record?
He used blocks, because he needed a way to use hashcash POW.  He began with hashcash POW because it required to central authority.  With this in mind, he developed a recording mechanism (blockchain) by which groups of transactions could have hashcash applied to them in order to provide nodes an objective method for agreeing on which transactions were "valid."  A blockchain is, otherwise, a somewhat clumsy way of recording.  But for trustlessly applying hashcash, a blockchain is probably the most elegant way to record and order transactions.
It seems silly when others are trying to create a blockchain with a trusted consensus mechanism.  They are introducing complexity while removing the value that created the need for complexity.  Silliness.

Market cap can grow substantially.  All that requires is an influx of Big capital.  All the velocity of money theories are bullshit at this point.  What is the velocity of gold?  Practically zero.
You say we are at capacity.  But with what? Tiny bullshit transactions.  Big money does not care about those.  And they can and will be priced off the chain.

If there is one thing we've learned over the last few years, it's that consensus is a unicorn--which is why the idea of Bitcoin is so great.  We should have been able to achieve consensus for a POW change years ago.  Even with one miner controlling &gt;51% of the hash and constantly threatening to attack while colluding with anti-privacy people and patenting a process to cheat the "proof" of work, we can't get consensus for a POW change.
We are going to have to do it without consensus, or not do it at all.
There is a chance though that we will have almost complete abandonment that will kill a chain that doesn't change the POW algo.

Only if you strip out emotion and view the outcome as only boolean (guilty or not guilty).  But that requires exclusion of lots of other very real and impactful outcomes.  For instance, months later, at the actual sentencing hearing (Roger muddles the two hearings as though they were one, but this transcript is from his hearing to enter a plea), the judge likely feels less inclined to use his discretion to give a lighter sentence.  After all, there is a mens rea (mental culpability component) for crimes, and the deceptive tactics suggests a lack of remorse.  Further, for every dealing Roger has with the government (like asking to enter the country), Roger's file pertaining to his selling of explosives through the mail may be reviewed, which will include his transcript (possibly even the webpage with his version).  It does not look good.  The outcome would have been better had he followed the advice of his lawyer and answered "Yes, Your Honor" and "No, Your Honor."

Jesus Christ!  How the hell can you not know by now that SegWit actually increases the actual block size?
Currently, blocksize = transaction data + witness data, which, in aggregate, is capped at 1 MB.
With SegWit, the transaction format is rearranged slightly:
Currently it is: version input1(utxo1, witness1), input2(...), input3(...), outputs..., locktime
With segwit it becomes: version utxo1 utxo2... outputs... witness1 witness2... locktime
In both scenarios, the 1MB limit is measured at the output.  But as you can see, with SegWit, the witness data follows the output.  Accordingly, under SegWit, witness data does not get counted (with regard to old nodes).
By moving signature after the outputs, witness data does not get counted.  This means that with SegWit, only the transaction data (input utxos and outputs) are capped to 1MB.  But the witness data is still a substantial, but uncounted, portion of the block.  That's how SegWit allows for blocks up to about 3.7MB and on average at about 2.1 MB.
**Get it through your thick skulls.  SEGWIT IS AN ACTUAL REAL NOT-FAKE BLOCKSIZE INCREASE.**
With that said, Bitcoin is fine if SegWit doesn't go through.

The most interesting thing about Bitcoin is its its increasing usage as a store of wealth outside the purview of government.  Many governments have failed miserably at providing a stable currency, and when they do, they sometimes start to confiscate other means of storing wealth.  Bitcoin challenges this ability and that's what is most interesting about it.  It is becoming the world reserve currency.  It may never be used for day-to-day purchases or transfer money in "seconds."  But no court order will cause a third party to erase your balance (so long as it remains decentralized).

Don't put words in my mouth.  That's your assertion, not mine.
Blockstream is doing fantastic work for Bitcoin.  And their business model is like other engineering firms (or law firms); they sell expertise.  And they prove their expertise by the projects they are involved in (Bitcoin, for instance).  And they have proven to be the go to experts.
All people (and companies) need to have their motives considered, because all people (and companies) have self-interest in mind.  But with companies, you would end your inquiry with that simpleminded observation.  That's wholly unsatisfying, because using your logic, I would have to exclude all people from working on Bitcoin due to self-interest.
The proper view is to begin the inquiry with interests.  Then find where there are conflicts.  Then consider whether it's the conflicting interests are mutually exclusive.  With Circle they are.  With Blockstream they are not.  But the inquiry does not end with that either.
If they are not mutually exclusive, then you have to consider actions to see which interests they are serving.  This is fact specific.
And here is where the beauty in Blockstream is found.  A group of Core developers figured out very early on exactly the best path for Bitcoin to take to be most useful to the world.  Then they figured out how to get paid for continuing to develop Bitcoin towards that end.  Then they aligned their self-interest with the best long-term interest of Bitcoin.  This setup makes them some of the least conflicted of all people.
A simple-minded companies-are-bad approach doesn't hold--ever.  And that's not how I arrived at the proper conclusion that Circle would harm Bitcoin for their profits.

It requires a hard fork.  At this point all hard forks are contentious, because too many of us are fundamentally opposed to the threat to immutability that hard forks pose.  And to further complicate the matter, the market values the security of immutability caused by the inability to hard fork (uncertainty = risk = lower price).  Because the market values the security of immutability, any threat to hard fork results in a value decline.  And because big miners like the value of their rewards being high, they won't even threaten a hard fork.
Pretty soon, if not already, the same reluctance that exists for hard forks will form also against soft forks as well.  The market will value the additional certainty, and the inability to soft fork will be secured.    At this point Bitcoin will be solidified.
I, and others, are happy to solidify Bitcoin.  We are good if SegWit cannot be deployed.  The only reason we acquiesce was the benefits seemed like a reasonable compromise for the coffee purchasers.
But if the coffee purchasers refuse the compromise, then fine.  They don't understand that we actually value "indefinite stalemate."  They think that if they block SegWit we will cave.  What they don't understand is that if SegWit is blocked, my side gets its way faster.
It's really kind of funny.  They can't figure out why we have not budged.  They think we are the most stubborn assholes to ever exist.  They don't realize that we value the contention.  They don't realize that the contention is what secures the immutability of Bitcoin.  How damn frustrating must this exercise in futility be for them?
The louder they scream and the harder they fight, the more they prove to the market that Bitcoin simply cannot be altered.  This fighting that leads to stalemate is the proof that Bitcoin is a true safe haven.

This is true.  **And it is good.**  Hard Forks are already too unlikely to be a threat.  Soon (if not already), soft forks will also be a thing of the past.  At that point, Bitcoin will have matured to become the first, and therefore likely the only, digital currency to achieve true immutability.  Bitcoin will truly be the most secure store of wealth the world has seen.  And the market price will reflect such.

Any attempt to do this could result in a chain split.  Exchanges (per ETC) will need to be ready to support both.  There is no guarantee the market will shift value to the new forked chain.  After all, the original (non-Segwit) chain is the one that has garnered the market value.
All of the uncertainty from even threats to do this would kill the market price of the original chain (even before a split), so I don't think the miners will do it.
There is a good chance that we are now stuck at an indefinite stale-mate.  And that is a good thing.

That is a really cool thing for Blockstream to offer its employees.  And while it provides no actual guarantee to a third party, this IPA seems to vest an interest in the employee that is less likely to be lost than the other layers are to be avoided.  And the employee is probably never going to be okay with someone else profiting from aggressive use of their patent.  Accordingly, it seems a strong protection, even without the guarantee to third parties.
It's even stronger that the inventor's interest is nonassignable, so they can't be bought out.  Pretty cool.

Contention is the *security of immutability*.   The security of immutability is very valuable.  If forks (hard or soft) can occur, immutability is not secure.  The markets will respond negatively to any threat to presupposed security.  Because miners rely on rewards, this will act as another strong disincentive for miners to threaten forks.
Presently, I don't think that markets have valued the security against soft forks.  I am excited at the prospect of them doing so.  Bitcoin is becoming truly sound money--the most secure money the world has ever known.

I've been to a lot of these hearings, so I guess I have context.  When Ver says it depends on how you define "threaten," he has already had it explained by his lawyer.  When he says he is on cold medicine, he has already had it explained by his lawyer.  The answers to those questions is "no, Your Honor [I have not been threatened]," just like the preceding few answers.  He has already decided to plead guilty, the hearing is a matter of formality.  Trying to insinuate threat by weaseling with the word is what you do to your mom or your home room teacher.  This is a federal court, let your lawyer do the arguing.  He's only hurting himself with that nonsense.
Then when he is asked whether his cold medicine impairs his decision-making, he says, "It might impair my ability to determine that [whether he can understand]. I feel pretty miserable. I have the flu currently."  Come on!  He's trying to find some loophole or error that he can cling to (and against his attorney's advice, I assure you).  Few people try to pull this nonsense, but the judge is well prepared and quickly rehabilitates Ver.  I think the exchange is better understood by simply posting it (with a little commentary):
THE COURT: Would it be better to do this a different day?
THE DEFENDANT: I'm prepared to do this today.
THE COURT: Again, I don't want to have a problem later because on reflection you don't believe you understood what you were doing. Does the medicine you take affect your judgment to the extent that you don't understand the questions I'm asking you?
THE DEFENDANT: **I don't think so**, Your Honor. (Just say no, Your Honor)
THE COURT: All right. Does it affect your understanding of the importance of this particular proceeding?
THE DEFENDANT: **I hope not**, Your Honor. I'm sure my mental capacity isn't, you know, up to par compared to how it would be normally (Ver thinks he is going to somehow create an appealable error, all he is really going to do is piss the judge off who has some discretion over his sentence, although they usually just stick to the guidelines).
THE COURT: Well, I want to be clear here that if you have any doubt about your ability to comprehend and understand what's taking place we should -- we should do it another time.
This is truly a case of haste makes waste. If you plead guilty today and decide two weeks from now that I really didn't mean to do that and if it hadn't been for that medicine I wouldn't have, it's going to be a very messy thing for everybody concerned *especially you.*
So if you have any question in your mind about your ability to think clearly this morning, I will continue this to another day.
THE DEFENDANT: In all honesty (**bullshit incoming**) I think that that might upset, you know, two of the attorneys present and I'm willing to sign today. (This is where he gets really silly, but judge is too smart)
THE COURT: But, you see, I appreciate your concern for them, but if sometime in the future you have buyer's remorse about this plea agreement, to be very blunt about it, and you say, "I didn't understand what was happening and I didn't knowingly and intelligently give up my rights and I didn't understand the
consequence of my plea," then that would have to be litigated.
I don't want to create a situation where that's going to occur. So I have to ask you again if you have any doubt about your ability mentally to proceed this morning, then we should proceed at a different time.
THE DEFENDANT: I'm prepared to sign today. I feel I can do so knowingly and intelligently. (Bitcoin Jesus Christ! Did he really think he was going to pull some juvenile shit with the judge and get out of this? Just answer the questions the way your attorney told you to and accept your sentence.  You've had way more than plenty of time before the hearing to decide whether you want to plead guilty.)

That inability is always going to come only from social pressure.  The only reason forks will be impossible is because there is always enough contention.

**Segwit IS a block size increase. There is no additional package or data trimming.**
For each transaction, the witness data is segregated from the input data and moved until after the output data.
The transaction format is rearranged slightly:
Currently it is: version input1(utxo1, witness1), input2(...), input3(...), outputs..., locktime
With segwit it becomes: version utxo1 utxo2... outputs... witness1 witness2... locktime
**This is how it increases the block size:**
Because it was never envisioned that witness data could be moved, the measure of a transaction's size is counted up to the end of the outputs.  By moving the witness data after the outputs, it does not get counted in the measurement (for old nodes) but it is still very much a part of the blocks.   **That's what creates the actual block size increase.**  It's not data trimming.
The block size is still transaction data + witness data, but under Segwit, the function that measures transaction size is only counting the transaction data that ends with outputs and it doesn't count the witness data, although it is still very much a part of the transaction.  Therefore under Segwit, the transaction data is limited to 1 MB, but the witness data (for old nodes) is not limited at all.  Under new nodes, however, the witness data is limited under the new block weighting system.
@_date: 2016-11-22 16:20:54
They can't fork it because they can't run a node.  The people will simply be left with fiat Bitcoin.  And it is quite easy for the government to shut down the adoption of another cryptocurrency (even Bitcoin) at the exchange level.
Once the government has that stronghold, it's damn near impossible to defeat it.  Bitcoin has a chance (long shot), but only because of its greatly enhanced features over traditional money.  Altcoins won't have these over Bitcoin (which will be good enough).
What you guys would have us do is set Bitcoin up as a Trojan horse of sorts.  It would be adopted as ungovernable, but would slowly transition to fiat as it "scales."
And right now, you are basically acknowledging that, but saying that it's okay because we can just switch.  Switching is easier said than done (which is damn near impossible), and the whole exercise is pointless if we can simply prevent governance now.

You don't get it.  You want to bikeshed over the best block size.  There are too many of us for you too ever gain the consensus required to hard fork without killing market value in the process (and miners will not do this).  You want to discuss the best specs if we were to agree to hard fork.  But we are fundamentally opposed to hard forking (soft forking), because it is the number one threat to the security of immutability.  You are arguing that we need to fork in order to prevent something that only a fork can cause.  That's absolutely ridiculous to us.  You can never change the 21 million limit of you can't even garner the consensus to change the block size from 1 to 2.
At this point, the market is already valuing the fact that Bitcoin cannot be hard forked.  Any viable threat to do so, will harm market value.  Invested miners, who rely on the value of their rewards, WILL retreat.  It's never going to happen.  Ever.

So let's get this straight.  **Gavin writes a blog post about Craig Wright to say everyone should just ignore Craig Wright--FACEPALM!**  Gavin claims that he thinks there are only two possibilities with regard to Craig Wright: (1) that he is Satoshi and wants the world to think he is not or (2) that he is a fraud who tricked *some pretty smart people* (He only "tricked" Gavin.  What an ego?).
**In either case, Gavin should be saying the same thing--"Wright is not Satoshi."**  But that's not what he says.  This is all bullshit.  Gavin is still trying to hide the fact that he tried to defraud the community with a fake Satoshi he hoped could push through a hard forked block increase.
Let's analyze.


Well then, out of respect, why does Gavin keep insinuating that he think's he is Satoshi?  Why wouldn't Gavin respect his wishes?
After all, Gavin says,


Why wouldn't Gavin have just come out and said, "Craig Wright is not Satoshi.  I was wrong."?
The only other option, according to Gavin is


In which case, Gavin should say, "Craig Wright is not Satoshi.  I was wrong."
Instead, after months of everyone mostly ignoring Craig Wright (and Gavin), he brings up Wright to tell everyone to ignore Wright.  Gavin is a super loser.
Gavin reminds me of a small child who thinks you can't see what they hide behind their back even when they turn their back to you.  Any adult should be able to see what is going on here.  Gavin desperately wanted a block size increase.  He did not have the political clout and calculated that Satoshi might.  So he needed to get Satoshi to back him.  So Gavin and Wright set out to trick everyone by providing a forged blockchain signature.  It would have worked someone had not converted the signature and scanned the blockchain to realize the signature was already on the chain.  Gavin tried to pull this stunt with plausible deniability, but it was so quickly discovered, that there seemed no plausible way he could actually believe Wright is Satoshi (if it had taken a weak to discover, it might seem more plausible).  After everyone was thoroughly convinced that Wright is not Satoshi, Gavin is left in this awkward position, where he must choose between admitting he was lying or admitting he was tricked.  He can never admit lying.  And he knows that if he now says that he thinks Wright is not Satoshi, then it looks like he has been lying for eight (not six) months.  So he continues to insinuate that he thinks Wright might be Satoshi not realizing most know that a reasonable person acting under his premises in good faith would just say "Wright is not Satoshi."  **To all but the hopelessly gullible and those who are lying as well, it's obvious that Gavin is still lying.**

Most of the current on-chain transactions don't need to be traceable.  When a user-friendly LN is implemented, most will move off chain.  Blocks will then be small and miners will have to limit the size in order to establish a fee market.

I don't really see it this way.  The market really values the security of Bitcoin's immutability.  All forks (hard or soft) are a threat to that.  The market seems to already value the practical inability to hard fork.  It will likewise value the inability to soft fork.  This is not to say that I don't think SegWit is great.  I think it is fantastic (lots of pros, no cons).  But because SegWit is so great, blocking it may be the best way to send a loud and clear message to the market regarding the security of Bitcoin's immutability.  And Bitcoin won't garner the huge market until the market is convinced that there is no chance of change by the whims of the masses, the miners, or the devs.  So I guess I'm good either way, but blocking SegWit will probably make us richer faster.
Maxwell probably gave the best analogy.


@_date: 2016-11-19 22:51:34
You are confusing Segwit and the Lightning Network.  The Lightning Network makes use of payment networks for thousands of practically instant transactions per second.
Segwit is a restructuring of a transaction to put signatures after outputs while they currently come after inputs.  It would fix malleability and would result in a capacity increase since the limitation on transaction's size measures the size only up to the end of outputs.
Bitcoin is arguably better without malleability and with more capacity.  But I kind of hope we block Segwit because it will send a strong message to the market that Bitcoin is absolutely immutable (can't be forked, hard or soft).  I'm alright if it goes through too (for the listed benefits and others not listed).  But I'll get richer quicker otherwise.
@_date: 2016-11-23 17:59:30


When it comes to the technology (coding, etc.) you know what you are doing.  But when it comes to the politics of this, I think you might be underestimating the difficulty of achieving the agreement necessary to affect a hard fork that does not greatly threaten to split the chain and destroy market value with just its threat.
There are a growing number of us who are fundamentally opposed to any changes to the protocol.  And it makes sense.  We value the security of immutability, because we know the market will also value this.  We recognize that disagreement is the antithesis of consensus and is therefore the only way to truly secure immutability.
Because there are a growing number of people like me, says (and then gets attacked for saying)


Soon enough (maybe already), soft forking will likewise be impossible.
The ability to change consensus rule is a direct threat to the security of immutability.  Overcoming people like us (who will also show great representation in market value) is quickly becoming an insurmountable task.  It will soon work that any viable threats to do so will result in a market decline, deterring miners from even entertaining such notions.  Big Money will pay more for Bitcoin when they deem it a safe haven secured against alterations.  And they don't care about coffee/weed purchases.

Yes they can.  And this is one of the primary reasons for requiring a high threshold for enforcement.  Recall the CLTV softfork (prior to BIP9).  It had a 75% activation period, then a 95% enforcement period.  If after the enforcement had been met, the 5% had produced blocks that violated the new rules, the upgraded nodes would have rejected, while the other nodes would have propagated.  Then, if there were a strong market for the original, non-CLTV, chain then there is a market nightmare as miners quickly switch back and forth.  The non-compliant block might not actually get orphaned.  Instead the fork gets miscarriaged.  Of course, the higher the threshold, the less likely this is, because the market price differential must be so much greater.  (And for other reasons.) But if you tried to do this with 60%, there is a real strong chance of miscarriage, because of the strong network effect behind the original "real" chain.
With BIP9, I don't know all of the details, but once there is enforcement (1 difficulty period after a difficulty period of &gt;95% blocks), then a block that is non-compliant can fork.


I am not sure (some say you can).  But it doesn't really matter from a security perspective.  To change the consensus rules (hard or soft) requires consensus.  The process can look very similar (long delays before activation/enforcement).  And the ability to achieve consensus is the threat.  As time passes, there should be a growing resistance to change built within the system as more capital and many more diverse perspectives are required to agree for any change.  This gets especially difficult when many of the people required to consent are fundamentally opposed to consensus, due to its threat to the security of immutability.

I prefer the word "think."  I think miners are an integral part of the system, but not worthy of trust with regards to keeping Bitcoin decentralized (if they were, they wouldn't allow themselves to acquire such a dominant hashrate).  In fact, I think nobody should be "trusted" in order for Bitcoin to succeed.
As far as my feelings go, I empathize with the large miners and realize that I would behave similarly (except, I wouldn't engage in some of the deception I am seeing).  Minus the deception, I'm good with miners, but not good with trusting them.

I don't know... I like some of the others better.  I like where he tries to divert the judge from the capacity issue by saying he will just go ahead and do this to keep the lawyers from getting upset.  And I like how the court appreciated his "concern" for the lawyers.
I also like the one where instead of answering whether the supposed medicine would affect his capacity, he says, "I hope not"
He was trying everything he could to trick the judge into making a mistake on capacity after quickly being shut down on getting the judge to make a mistake on whether he was threatened.
He still uses the same type tactics when he explains his way out of the Gox video on solvency.  Or when he explains that he won't be the "only one" blocking Segwit.  He uses weasel tactics (equivocations and ambiguities) to lie.  It works on a bunch of redditors, not on trained officers of the court.  He can't be trusted.

No it wasn't.  One guy can create a crypto-currency.  No agreement needed.  Regardless, the purpose of the design is to require human consensus to change it.  Early in a digital currencies existence, that consensus is easily attained (not many people using it).  And for that reason, not much money will be stored on such a crypto.  As time passes it gets more difficult to attain consensus as more people adopt.  That difficulty attracts even more money, because those who are looking for a secure store of value know that immutability to the machine behavior is achieved by the inability of humans to form consensus.

There is nothing tautological about this.  The more difficult the currency is to meddle with, the more secure it is against human meddling.  And the design of Bitcoin is such that with adoption, the difficulty in meddling increases--the more people and the more diversity in viewpoints and motives, the more difficult consensus is.  Amongst diversity, the requirement of consensus is the guarantee of gridlock.

Not that concerned with coffee/weed purchases.  Interested in BIG money safe haven.  But I was willing to compromise with SegWit and LN--kind of thought I had to until opinions became too diverse to execute soft forks.  But I'd rather not, and it looks like I won't have to.  We are way ahead of my projected schedule on protocol solidification.
If you guys really want, you can probably go with the Thunder network or something.  Or you can use trusted off-chain processors.  Immutability is way more valuable than the loss of SegWit functions.

It's not a very important property (or even a desirable property) for buying coffee or for most of the transactions that are presently recorded on the blockchain.

I agree we need a backlog.  But for years, when devs were telling miners not to raise the soft limit, they did it anyway.  By your definition, they were working against the best interest of the network for what they perceived was their own best interest.  Worse, this behavior required development of the relay network--a centralizing factor that worked to the detriment of Bitcoin as a whole, but to their own anti-competitive advantage.

Only if you're going to use checkpoints (which are thought anti-Bitcoin).
Each block is hashed with the previous, which is also hashed with the previous, such that validating new blocks requires first validating every prior block back to the genesis block.  So even you are running a limited node, the first stage involves actually downloading the entire blockchain (every transaction ever confirmed).

This requires a change to the consensus rules.  Regardless of how good the reason, immutability means no changes to the consensus rules.  And we value immutability above all.  Therefore, we will contend this fork.  And any threat to implement will result in a market decline, further deterring miners from even threatening the fork.  This is how immutability is primarily secured (then through POW secondarily).  Nakamoto consensus.

the action of helping or doing work for someone.
That's what miners do.  That's all they do, and they get paid only when they produce their proof of work.  And that work is what allows people to transact.  It's paid for in two ways: Subsidy, which is an inflationary tax on the whole system, and fees, which are charges to the individual users.  Over time, the system is designed to slowly adjust from subsidy to entirely fee reward.

If you'd like, I would be willing to review and collaborate on your final draft before publication.  You might like this for two reasons.  First, I was formerly an executive editor for a technology law journal, and I am pretty good at it.  Second, because I don't spend nearly the time and effort on things I type on Reddit as I do things I publish, I might be able to help capture any nuance to my position that is lost in sloppy Reddit drafting.  This could result in a better publication.  My only caveat is that I must remain anonymous.
To your immediate points:
I'm not so naïve as to believe that there is no value in also having Bitcoin serve as a fast, high-volume, low-fee medium of exchange for transactions of even small sizes.  Of course, I would love if Bitcoin could do that.  But any value added by attempting to turn layer-1 into that is far outweighed by the value lost on the security of Bitcoin's immutability.  And given the choice (which we are not, because Bitcoin naturally moves towards solidification), I would choose the security of immutability.


I am happy for Bitcoin.  Circle's previous business model would require sacrificing layer-1's biggest strength, it's immutability.  When people start to understand what Bitcoin is, then companies will form under models that adapt to Bitcoin rather than demanding Bitcoin adapt.  Bitpay may be able to hang around for a while, but if they don't adapt, then they won't make it either.  That's sad, but that's business (and Bitcoin was created because some were too big to fail 


If you think that Layer-2 solutions will never form, then the only reason to remove the limits is to absolutely trade Bitcoin's immutability and let it become a clunky miner-controlled (governable) PayPal 2.0 that never serves well as a store of value.  Otherwise, any slight capacity raises serve only to confuse the market and attract more Circles only to have them leave when Bitcoin inevitably reaches capacity again. Some might consider that deceitful, but I am not so much motivated by that.  I consider it harmful to Bitcoin.  If Layer-2 solutions are not going to exist, then I think it is best for Bitcoin if Layer-1 remains secure in its immutability (reminder: we don't have a choice) and for Bitcoin's market value to be based on accurate understanding of what Bitcoin actually is.
But if there *will be* layer-2 solutions, I am fine if there is an extended time when capacity demands create high fees (it's not a big deal).  But, because soft-forks hadn't yet become too contentious, and because SegWit is so beneficial, it seemed like a reasonable enough compromise to allow more low-fee time while layer-2 is developing.  However, after that, we need to start seeing the market solidify even against soft-forks.  But if you don't believe there will ever be a layer-2 and you are still promoting capacity increases, then you must plan on doing that until Bitcoin is completely insecure and centralized. You too, like Ver, must be willing to ["risk"]( this highly certain outcome.  The market is not, which is why there is no practical option to hard fork.


In my estimation, the result is that Bitcoin becomes the reserve currency that all others are measured against.  Currently different fiat currencies being measured against themselves as the powers that be collude to inflate the currencies together.  When Bitcoin is fully adopted, fiat currencies will again have an asset to be measured against.

Maxwell got into it with the moderators about blocking any mention of the guy in this article.  He mentioned his name and his employer **without ever even mentioning his Reddit username.**  Of course his Reddit username is listed as defendant alongside his real name in public bankruptcy court documents.  
Prior to settlement bankruptcy court was going to determine whether the payments to this individual were made fraudulently (preferentially) in contemplation of bankruptcy.  Because the case was settled, there aren't many facts.  But in fairness to the individual, even if the court had found "fraud," it could have simply been "constructive fraud," which does not have culpability requirement.  It simply requires preferential payments to creditors within a certain time frame.  Payments to preferred creditors leave other creditors with less.  Charitable donations can even be clawed back under constructive fraud.
With that said, I suspect there was actual knowledge of and participation in bad behavior.

This is a good start.  We have narrowed the scope of the conversation.  Let's challenge one of your beliefs.
You believe miners are trustworthy because their huge investment makes them interested in the long-term value.  And you believe this is a key reason why Bitcoin works.




I, on the other hand, believe miners are not are not trustworthy.  Therefore the limit is the key reason Bitcoin works.
So let's challenge whether their interests are long-term and aligned.
(For the purpose isolating issues, in this conversation a miner should be considered someone who does not hold their rewards or large sums of Bitcoin.)
Miners spend money to purchase machines.  This is a sunk cost for a machine that is certain to be quickly obsolete.  In order to profit, they must collect enough fees and rewards to recover their funds as soon as possible.  And because they are in an arms race, any advantage they don't take to collect fees and rewards will be taken by their competitor.  This causes them to place far more emphasis on the short-term than the long-term.  The long-term investor is the person who holds and purchases many Bitcoins (from miners often) with the purpose of increasing their wealth over a longer duration.  Because these people determine the current market value and because miners are most interested in rewards, miners are beholden to these people.  If miners do a thing that frightens these people, miners are harming their chances of earning a return, because these people respond to the fear by selling and lowering market value.  Accordingly, because miners are interested in the short-term, they never do anything that might truly spook the short-term market.
How is this miner (the miner who sells its rewards) interested in the long-term?
@_date: 2016-12-04 21:13:09
Does not matter.  They both require consensus.  And the ability to attain that is the threat.  Consensus is supposed to guarantee gridlock.


And it offers wonderful benefits with practically no downsides.  That's why the market will respond so favorably if it is blocked.  It will be a great sign of Bitcoin's maturation towards immutability.


This is just dumb shit people say when they don't know what else to say.  There is nothing to be afraid of right now.  If SegWit passes, then good.  If it does not, then great.  Moreover, I purchased my bitcoins in 2012 and am still holding them.  My portfolio is already too heavily weighted and I am not acquiring more.  What I am discussing will boost the value, not decrease it.  If you think that blocking SegWit will harm market value, you don't understand market mentality.

So you are arguing about causation.  You are saying the ensuing hard fork is the cause, but not the soft.  This is error.
In law, this happens frequently, as causation is an element (meaning must be proven) in almost every cause of action.  We break causation down into two types, actual cause and proximate cause.  (There are others, but outside the scope).  The legal understanding of causation is universally applicable.
Actual causation (also called cause-in-fact) is somewhat easy to understand.  It is determined with a ["but for" test.](
Example application:  But for John stabbing George with a knife, George would have lived.  If this statement is true, then actual causation exists.  
But in law, actual causation is not enough to establish the element of causation requisite to guilt or responsibility.  The reason for this is because actual causation can be established for very tenuously related things.  For instance:
But for Jane giving birth to John (who stabbed George), George would not have died from the John's stabbing.  The statement is true, therefore Jane delivering John is an actual cause of George's death.  But without more it would be absurd to hold Jane responsible for George's death--she couldn't foresee that.
The foreseeability portion is covered under [proximate cause (some jurisdictions merge actual cause into proximate cause)](  This is the more objective portion of the test.  It's based on the reasonable foreseeability of a certain result.  This is the portion that is determined by the fact-finder (jury or judge in a bench trial).
When John stabbed George, it was reasonably foreseeable that it could result in George's death.  Accordingly, there is proximate cause.  So the entire element of causation would be established in law.  But proximate cause would not be found with Jane, because she could not reasonably foresee that her delivery of George would result in George's death.
With that said.  With a split from a soft fork, the "but for" test is satisfied.  But for the soft fork there would not have been chain split.  With proximate cause, the answer is also relatively simple.  It is reasonably foreseeable that once a split occurs, the market may not value the new rule chain.  And it's reasonably foreseeable that miners wishing to be rewarded would switch back to the chain where the market rewards them.  Accordingly, proximate cause is established.
In a hypothetical negligence action against miners who caused financial harm through a soft fork, the element of causation would be met, because the soft fork actually and proximately caused the spilt.  Of course a negligence action against miners would fail for other reasons (most obviously, plaintiffs probably could not establish the duty element).
To say it isn't the soft fork that caused the split, but instead, the following "hard fork" is like saying it wasn't the stabbing that killed George, it was his bleeding out.  In both instances the second cause was not a guarantee (George might not have bled out and a switch-back might not have occurred).  But if your definition causation means there must be no other following cause, then the narrowness of the rule swallows the word completely; nothing ever caused anything.
Understanding these principles, you have to admit that a soft fork can cause a network split and with a low threshold all that is required is that the miners attempting to soft fork switch back because they misread the market.
@_date: 2016-12-09 17:24:23


Over-producing the size of blocks (not Bitcoin rewards) is possible if they are not limited.  But that is not what I was saying.  Overproduction oil and natural gas is simply an example of individual incentives causing market participants to work against what they know is in their long-term interest.  By knowingly over-producing, people who should be interested in the long-term harm they are causing themselves choose to cause that harm for individual short-term gain.  With Bitcoin mining, adjusting the blocksize towards centralization would be similarly incentivized.  The miners will be short-term incentivized to do this, even while knowing they are causing harm.  Debt exacerbates the problem.  And we've already seen the behavior in miners when they would raise the blocksize beyond the soft-limits even against the advice of the developers.  This led to the need for a relay network (centralized) in order to keep the network functioning properly.  There were no miners who did not understand the effect of doing this, but without a limit, they all find themselves in a [prisoner's dilemma]( that results in behavior destructive to the whole.


There's no bright line rule, but the distinctions are clear.  A person like myself holds with only price points for a slow exit in order to keep a portfolio balanced.  My long-term has no timeframe.  It is indefinite.  We are the type of people who control the market value.  If we are spooked, we sell.  That selling pressure is the short-term incentive that keeps miners from threatening to hard fork.  Soon, if not already, it will also prevent them from soft-forking.  Big holders don't like the risk such activities pose (that's true even if they think and hope the forks will work).  Holders (generally) are long-term.  Miners, on the other hand, seem to be looking only to the next block and generally concerned with no more than 1.5 years to recover their investment in equipment that is quickly becoming obsolete.  This is very short-term thinking and it is not in the interest of Bitcoin's success.  This thinking could cause someone to sacrifice Bitcoin in the long-term in order to profit in the short (debt makes it worse).




They are invested in deteriorating mining equipment [(very similar to declining oil wells)]( which means they need Bitcoin to be marketable just long enough to recapture investment and hopefully turn a profit.  I have years of experience in similar mentalities, and the reason I have done so well is because I can predict behavior with a full empathetic understanding of incentives.


That's arguable (depends on incentives), but beside the point.  I am not advocating trusting developers, I love Bitcoin because it is "trustless," and to change that requires human consensus from a wide array of people.  For this reason, I am generally against consensus, and will become more so against consensus as Bitcoin matures (and so will the market).  Presently, the miners will not attempt to enforce a consensus change unless they are sure the market won't punish them.  But the market will punish any change in which a large segment of holders disagree with (they will sell).  And large holders generally don't become large holders by "trusting."  Due diligence is required.  And if you think that developers are blindly trusted, you are wrong.  Every move of the current set of developers is openly challenged and criticized (even by you), and my challenges are done silently with analysis and diversity of opinions.  While developers have influence (louder voices) and some stored good will, this is not enough to garner consensus.  And the requirement of consensus is an anti-trust mechanism far stronger than just open source.
Removing the block limit that has been there for years places trust in miners not to centralize when short-term incentives might lead them to knowingly move the market towards centralization.  Moreover, for some larger miners, economies of scale may work to their advantage so well that centralizing is even in their long-term interest.  Miners are not trustworthy with the blocksize.  It is somewhat of a shame that mining has pooled to become so concentrated.
Another reason you asserted that miners are trustworthy is because they are already "trusted" with transaction selection (but not maximum block size).  But they will choose transactions regardless of the block size, so the point is somewhat irrelevant.  Still, trusting with blocksize is unwise (due to misaligned incentives) while trusting with transaction selection does not present the same threats.  However, the fact that [Antpool routinely produces empty blocks]( even when there is a backlog is a perfect example of how miners cannot even be trusted with the best interests of Bitcoin.  Even with this tiny bit of trust, miners will game the system to their individual advantage to the detriment of the network.  I don't fault this; they are simply doing what they are incentivized to do.  But thankfully, there is not too much detriment with a few empty blocks.  But with maximum block size in their control, unrecoverable damage could be inflicted (and should be expected based on incentives).
So I want to reflecting back on the originating discussion.  I pointed out two seemingly inconsistent positions:




I don't think we should trust developers or anybody with changing consensus rules (consensus should have much resistance).  Do you still think miners are trustworthy with determining the maximum blocksize?

Bad business plan.  They did not understand what Bitcoin is.  They would rape it and turn it into [PayPal 2.0 if it would make them profitable](  But Bitcoin is not here to put Visa/PayPal out of business (definitely not to make Circle money).

If Circle gets lucky, there will never be a good layer two, or else along with the FED, Bitcoin will also tackle PayPal, Visa, and even Circle.

The market segment that values the security of immutability the most is the portion that chooses to store large amounts of value in Bitcoin.  This segment also has the greatest influence to deter miners from introducing unwanted risk into the system.  When miners do this, the large holders get spooked and sell.  To this segment, the ability to hard fork is a threat to the security of their holdings.
If the past two years have taught us anything, it's that the ability to hard fork is low. Learning this has made Bitcoin less risky for this segment.  And less risk is reflected in higher price.  This higher price makes it even less likely for miners to threaten a hard fork, because miners are punishing themselves by causing the price to decline.
I'm saying that the same thing is going to happen with soft forks.  Big money is scared by the ability to change the consensus rules.  Accordingly, the ability to achieve consensus is a threat.  And people ARE concerned that change can lead to unintended consequences.  Change is risky.  BUT... If something as great as SegWit gets blocked, the message to the market (the large store of value segment) is clear:  Bitcoin's immutability is very secure.  That message is likely to attract even more capital.  And this capital will flee as soon as miners threaten soft forks.  Accordingly, miners will not threaten even great soft forks for the reason that they presently won't threaten hard forks.  And Bitcoin will become solidified as the first truly immutable cryptocurrency (not technically, but practically).
Your argument against this is to say that there can be no harm with soft forks, because they can't cause a fork.  I'm pretty sure you now understand that is wrong.  Moreover, there are other potential unintended consequences from Soft Forks that will still make the immutability crowd highly reluctant and skeptical of them.  The year's worth of development/testing for SegWit evidences the risky nature of such a change.
But many would say that the benefits of SegWit are worth the change.  Maybe so, I consider implementing SegWit a win.  But if it does not implement, I think it is concomitant that the perception of immutability will attract the type of money that will, ironically, secure Bitcoin's immutability.  Their perception of immutability thus becomes self-fulling due to their reaction.
For this reason, Greg Maxwell says that the loss of SegWit is not "unmitigated."  Because at some point, Bitcoin needs to become very secure against immutability.  He thinks it's premature.  I think that regardless of when the proper time is, the blocking of SegWit will likely cause it.  And the ensuing price increase makes it also a win for me (I hold a substantial amount).

Primarily what I bring to the table is contention.  Contention is the enemy of forks (hard and soft), which I am against in all cases, except the one where Bitcoin has lost its security of immutability (e.g., quantum computers or a cornering of the market for hash power).  In that one case, I am for forking an algo change (to an altcoin if you will), because Bitcoin is already broken (requiring of trust), even if still functional.
Ironically, since you have no idea why you are arguing with me, but don't know why, then I have succeeded with you.  Better success is when I get people to agree to always contend forks (never agree unless immutability is already lost).
By bringing contention, I bring Bitcoin the security of immutability.

To have a highly duplicated, completely immutable record of transactions for the most secure store of wealth the world has known, I would pay a whole lot more in fees than we are currently paying.  And so will anyone else looking to store and transfer serious wealth (probably not coffee purchasers).
The above is true even if there were no layer 2 solutions.  But the fact that there are layer 2 solutions in development that make even cheap coffee payments possible makes it a no-brainer.

Bitcoin influence should be a meritocracy.  And if it is, Gavin will have no influence.  There is very little to warrant Gavin having a following.  Therefore, he resorts to populism.

Bingo.  I can't speak to the plan of others.  But you must understand, we really do believe (with good cause) that Bitcoin has matured to the point where hard forks are no longer feasible.  There are too many people who value the security of immutability given by the contention.  Accordingly, they will contend every hard fork.  And since these people tend to represent the big money in the market, they wield heavy influence (even silent influence) over the miners who don't want to see the value of their rewards decline, by scaring these guys out of their positions.


Correct.  But... you are missing something.  There doesn't have to be another cryptocurrency.  SegWit is not needed for side chains.  CSV and CLTV was all that was needed for Bitcoin to have full-feature side chains that can do everything another cryptocurrency could do, but with Bitcoin.  And that's what Maxwell was referring to in your linked article when he said the following:




In short, yes, but we don't have to abandon the idea.  But I am okay with abandoning that idea if it required removing decentralization and adding trust (governance).  As the linked article eloquently states


I, like you, would like Bitcoin to be all things to all people, but I'm a realist.  And Bitcoin is what it is.  "On chain scaling" will kill decentralization and will lead to a trusted system (See [Ver](  Moreover, as a realist, even if I did agree that we could scale on chain, it doesn't matter because all hard forks are now contentious and will lead to market destruction.
While I am okay if Bitcoin doesn't become a scalable e-cash, for the reasons above, with side-chains alone (which could have SegWit and a Lightning Network), I think it can be all things.
Blocking SegWit now will send a loud message to the market that Bitcoin is now secure even against soft forks.  At that point, Bitcoin will be deemed truly secure in its immutability.  Like presently with hard forks, the market will then value such and devalue any attempts to challenge that security.
I've been for SegWit because of the benefits, and because soft forks have not yet become inherently too contentious (over time the contention will naturally build to solidify Bitcoin without us doing anything--people fight).  I was fine delaying the security to immutability.  But if we can go ahead and establish that security, then that's probably more presently valuable to Bitcoin than the benefits of SegWit (although for long-term technical planning, Bitcoin is probably better with SegWit and Schnorr).  At this point, however, I'm convinced that blocking SegWit will make me richer faster by giving the perception that Bitcoin's immutability is secure, thereby causing the market to actually secure Bitcoin's immutability.
But to be certain, hard forks are done with.  The following is not the plan, because the following is not practically possible.


@_date: 2016-12-05 00:16:24


Sounds good enough.  But very slow.  It took SegWit about a year to get coded.  If it takes a year and a half to implement I will feel pretty good about the Bitcoin's security.  In a few more years I expect there to be such a slushing that most changes will become practically impossible.  If SegWit is blocked (or slowly implemented), then I will take that as a signal that we have already arrived at that point.  And that should be celebrated.  It's certainly not a reason to start writing obituaries and epitaphs.

**We don't "trust" miners to build the blockchain.**  We require proof of work.  We do this so we don't have to trust anybody.  Minus POW, building a block is simple--just choose some valid transactions.  Any node could do it.  But without more, nodes couldn't distinguish which block of transactions is valid.  
Before Bitcoin, a task like this always required trusting a third party.  But by requiring proof of work, Bitcoin's creators intentionally made finding a valid block difficult.  The block building process became, (1) choose some valid transactions (any node could do this), then (2) repeatedly add some numbers to the end of that string of transactions and hash until a the miner has found a combination that produces a hash with a value less than the difficulty threshold (or until they've been informed that another has).  **The only reason we require this otherwise absolutely useless waste of energy is because we need a way to distinguish which blocks are valid *without trusting anybody.*  Proof of Work is otherwise useless.  We require miners to do these endless menial useless tasks only because we DO NOT trust miners.**
Moreover, miners are the mercenaries of the system and are the least worthy of trust, especially trusting them not to usurp to the disadvantage of their competition (monopolize).  Miners are already in an arms race to capture the most block rewards.  This exact same mentality is the very reason miners should be the last to be trusted with network.
In reality, we concentrate trust in no one, not even the devs.  All of their work must be open source.  And even if it is fantastic work of the highest quality, it only gets implemented if we decide to use it.  And because miners are absolutely beholden to the short-term market value (not so much the long-term), they won't run software that the market deters them from running by lowering the value of their rewards.  **The miners cannot fire the market, but the market and users can effectively fire the miners by drastically reducing their pay.**
Presently the miners are not trusted at all.  We don't trust them not to hard fork, the market figuratively holds a gun to their heads that prevents them from truly even threatening such.  If they want their machines to keep eating electricity and crapping out money, then they don't fork until the market has clearly told them to.  They work for us.  All day long they dig a hole and then refill it, because that's what gets them paid.

How ridiculous would it be if this somehow persuaded the decision to lose money?  "At least we all lose money."


No way.  Bitcoin's price will rise faster if SegWit is not adopted.  SegWit has some good features.  But to Big Money, none of that matters compared to the security of immutability, which the market values way more.  If something as good as SegWit can't be implemented, then it will seem highly unlikely for anything bad to even have a chance.  Great days are ahead.

I don't know why.  I have my suspicions.
I suspect Mike Hearn had ulterior motives for wanting to keep transactions on chain.  There is no way around the fact that Hearn wanted some form of blacklists.  He backed off once he was slammed for advocating such.
I also suspect that Satoshi knew he only had a rough idea for how to use payment channels to scale, but if he wanted to show people that Bitcoin *could* scale, all he needed to do was a little math that showed *A method* with data centers.  That method is easily understood and explainable (i.e., it's more sellable than a half-baked idea that confuses the matter).
Almost all of us (myself included) got into Bitcoin with the understanding that scaling would require data centers.  I never liked this--I saw it as a Trojan horse of sorts that would be adopted as decentralized and would scale into fiat--but I accepted it as a given and a possibility that it could remain ungovernable (plus, for investment purposes, I was okay with a Trojan horse if it made me richer and had a chance to remain decentralized).  Because of this widely-held understanding that this is the only way for Bitcoin to scale, most of us (myself included) were behind Gavin when he took the fight to the community.  However, I quit accepting his and Hearn's arguments in August 2015, when I finally stepped back and re-analyzed.
I realized that the Lightning Network, which had been proposed in February 2015 (just a couple of months before Gavin started the fight), changed the whole notion that Bitcoin must scale as a potential Trojan horse.  I realized that with a blockchain fee market (discussed in the white paper under incentives, and made possible by Satoshi's block limit), and with the routed payment channels, Bitcoin could remain inflation free, well-secured, and practically infinitely scalable without risking becoming governable.
Of course, at that moment, I began to question the motives of Gavin and Hearn.  Why, right after the Lightning paper (which showed a better scaling method), did they all of the sudden take their fight to the community?  It would seem that such a concept should have given them pause, but instead, they acted in furious haste (as though their window of opportunity was closing).  I suspect that's how they viewed the situation--their window was closing.  Just as Hearn wanted blacklists and no Tor, he wanted all transactions on chain, and LN is a huge threat to that.  The other threats to that are Maxwell's confidential transactions and coin swap and Mast and Schnorr and side chains.
If you think about it, the best way to prevent transactions from going dark is to take the control away from ordinary users.  The easiest way to do that is to bump the cap to 20 MB.  At that point, ordinary users could not even stop a fork, because they couldn't afford to even run a node.
That's what I suspect this is all about, and I think the guys at Blockstream (one of whom I suspect is part of the "we" that made up "Satoshi" in the white paper) are the guys who are trying to prevent Bitcoin from going down the path of fiat and financial monitoring.
So directly to your question.  I suspect Satoshi *sold* the most easily understood scalability method just to show Bitcoin could scale, and he discussed the more advanced, more-difficult-to-understand, and less developed method of scaling only with those who could understand.  Payment channel scaling was probably only a rough idea that he suspected could work, but needed development.
When I refer to Bitcoin as a Trojan horse adopted as decentralized and slowly becoming fiat, [Roger Ver calls it PayPal 2.0, and he is literally fine with that.](  PayPal 2.0 is not really accurate, it would actually be more like Federal Reserve Note 2.0, but the point is clear either way.  The other side knows that removing the block cap destroys decentralization.

Nope.  They'll be regulated (even ran by governments).  False premise leads to false conclusions.


Very difficult if nodes are capable of running over Tor. But that requires keeping Satoshi's block limit in place.

Exactly.  Also greed...  Demanding things for cheap/free.  Why aren't you more generous with your fees?
All parties are self-interested (greedy if you want to be a bit hyperbolic).  The purchaser wants to pay as little as possible, while the provider wants to receive as much as possible.
This is simply how markets (life) works.  You are getting nowhere by challenge people for self-interest.  The only reason you would even make such a challenge is because you too are self-interested (or greedy).

If those were concerns, then maybe.  But those look more like conclusions.  And the one that is false is this one.


You really really don't get it.  A hard fork will totally screw Bitcoin.  They are and should be practically impossible.  And it's people like me who make it that way (there are plenty of us and our voice is most powerful in the market), not Blockstream.  Blockstream founders just figured it out and determined how to deal with it earlier than most.
When asked what is wrong with SegWit and a 2MB fork, this was my response.  It should shed a little light on your perception.

It would help the network if miners would drain the mempool as fast as they can.  But attempting to do so either for the network, or for the fees could cost miners a few seconds on finding a block.  Accordingly, they're incentived to act in a manner that is detrimental to the best interest of the network.  And they do.
Now I don't fault them for this.  I expect people to act in their own best interest.  But because I do, I know it would be stupid to treat miners as stewards of the network by extending greater trust not to place their own interest ahead of the long-term best interest of Bitcoin.

They can be sold on an exchange while they are "locked."  The exchanges will be on the network as well.  And they'll receive zero-conf Lightning payments and credit your account.  None of this will record to the blockchain until channels close.  Then balances are settled on the chain.  But that could happen long after someone has cashed out.
@_date: 2016-12-03 20:46:06
There's a bit of a disincentive.  Right now fees are accounting for about 5% of revenue.  When blocks aren't full, they are less than 1% (inelastic supply).  SegWit results in revenue reduction by adding capacity.

Interesting.  You have been for XT and now for BU.  Strange that you would find this concerning.
I used to think you were a true believer, and maybe at one time you were.  But now I have begun to suspect that you are financially motivated to give control to miners.  And since you claim to have sold 9/10 of your Bitcoin 8 months ago (good investment decision, btw), I don't think that motivation is pure speculation on behalf of market value.
English is your second language.  Aren't you in China?  You spend all day arguing frivolously for anything that would result in control handed to the miners.  Which pool are you with?  Which manufacturer are you with?

Like I said, he argues first that we need to decentralize mining (to not trust miners), by advocating means that will result in centralizing mining and trusting miners.  When pointed out, he argues that miners are trustworthy because of their incentives.  When shown (over and over again) that miners do harmful things to the network he ignores those things.  In the case of AntPool's empty blocks, he decided to have the policy changed in order to quit giving the appearance of impropriety.
If there is one thing we know for certain (Cryptocurrency 101, if you will), it's that miners cannot be trusted with the network.  They will always game the system to their individual advantage.


I don't.  Not with a 1MB block size limit.  Miners aren't a huge threat until they are trusted as stewards.  Mining empty blocks while lobbying for larger block capacity shows Wu isn't even worthy of the trust miners are given over transaction selection.


You say that right around the time of Hearn's rage quitting you sold 90% of your Bitcoin holdings.  Good call.  Yet, that poor investment decision hasn't stopped you from daily advocating policy that you know would give control to miners.  You need to stop the charades.  Because of me, people are becoming aware of your ulterior motives.  And people like me will gladly solidify this protocol before handing it over to anyone, especially people like you.

How do you expect one not to with 49%?  You said that a split is not possible with a soft fork and that only a majority is needed.  Now you are trying to move the goal post to not likely with a high threshold.  That's MY point, NOT yours (it would take strong affirmative acts on behalf of the market, but could happen if most of the market disagreed with the few miners representing 95% of hash power).  Until you admit you were wrong, I'm not going to continue changing your mind while you dishonesty pretend I didn't.

What if you distinguish two types of adoption: user adoptions as a medium of exchange and capital adoptions as a store of wealth (sort of gold 2.0)?
Isn't the capital adoption apparent, even if it is coming primarily from countries where their fiat currencies are performing poorly as a store of wealth?
I mean the storing of wealth is always speculative, so I don't have a problem with acknowledging the speculative nature of Bitcoin.  Whether wealth is stored in a savings account, gold, land, equities, bonds, etc, there is always at least the speculation that the instrument will retain its value.  Often, there's even speculation that the instrument will gain.  So, yes, storing wealth in Bitcoin is speculative.  And at this point, there's probably more speculation for gain than in other traditional stores of wealth.  However, Bitcoin's speculative use for gain must decline over time as more and more recognize it as a store of wealth.  At that point, the speculative use will be like other stores of wealth--speculation that it will retain its value (not so much gain).
I guess bubble would be the term that I would question.  "Bubble" indicates that there will be a time that the market no longer values Bitcoin, or values it significantly less.  But why?  If fiat currencies (including CNY) are having problems, why would this not simply lead to long-term **capital adoption** of Bitcoin?  Of course, ordinary people with little wealth to store won't start using it, "organically," but is it not also organic if the wealthier begin using it as simply a better alternative?
Why is this a bubble?  And if, in the natural ebb and flow of things, Bitcoin crashes, where will it crash down to?  Perhaps $2500?  And when this happens, isn't this really just market participants re-balancing their portfolios (increasing the diversification of Bitcoin holders) while Bitcoin settles in and then continues its growth in capital adoption?  I mean to me, it all seems very organic.  If this process were contrived, it would be a lot smoother, but that would require concentration of trust and Bitcoin is trust-LESS.  These wild gyrations are evidence of organic growth.  This is what it looks like when the most secure store of wealth the world has every known is organically bootstrapped as a widely recognized store of wealth.  There's no throttle or governor (like technical value analysis), so the exchange rate is as bumpy as the emotions of market participants.  But to call it a bubble, when on average the thing has always just continued to rise, seems silly.

Roger Ver is shady as hell.  I pulled up his sentencing hearing transcript and read him trying to manipulate a federal judge (BTW: the transcript tells a very different story than Ver does, See below).  The judge had heard it all, and was hearing non of Ver's bullshit (Ver wouldn't give straight answers to questions like, "Do you understand this simple thing I just said to you?").  Of course, this just shows the judge that he is shady and in no way inspires feelings of mercy.
When I read this stuff, I see the same thing.  "I won't be the only one" is not a commitment.  It's his not-so-clever, sneaky way of trying to imply commitment with ambiguous language that he can later say was not a commitment.
It's his way.  I suspect he was raised mostly by an adoring, but weak-willed, mother who always sided with him and was easily persuaded by emotional tactics when he was wrong.
He seems to expect that in the real world he can get away with weak tactics that worked as a child.  For instance, when he is caught selling explosives, he is the victim of an unfair system that punished him for selling fireworks.  Why?  Because local officials sought political revenge?  When the judge asks him whether he was coerced into entering a plea of guilty, he tries to spin an offer to drop additional charges as a physical threat (judge too smart, rephrased the question).  When he was asked whether he had the capacity to understand, he tried to say he was on medication (judge too smart, offered to postpone, Ver finally and unequivocally acknowledged capacity).  And the linked message?  That's simply him doing the same stuff he did 15 years ago and has done all of his life.

@_date: 2016-12-09 21:04:50


It's hilarious to watch them fumble around with disjointed thoughts as they try to figure out what makes sound money.
In all fairness, what makes sound money is a difficult sort-of existential question.  With that said, there's no excuse for people interested in Bitcoin to have not already wrestled with the question and discovered the answer.  An interest in Bitcoin should early on stoke an intellectual curiosity that demands a satisfactory answer to this.  But it is clear that they have never resolved this central issue.  So many seem to simplistically rely on a velocity-of-money theory that obviously doesn't hold.
I've watched a few Ver videos and listened to his arguments.  I say this without any exaggeration, Ver is a mental midget when contrasted against someone like Greg Maxwell.  That he has no clue that he is not on par makes it kind of embarrassing to watch.
But the good news is he is becoming more vocal as he truly embraces his role of a prophetic leader.  As people that matter begin to hear his rationale behind his advocations, they will instinctively begin to place more weight on the words of his opponents.
I also watched his BU sales video in China.  Without a doubt, the earnest and intelligent listeners are persuaded to give pause if they had been seriously considering running BU.  Ver was literally arguing that not changing the software code was changing the "economic code," as though it is some real thing. Everyone in the audience is thinking, "he's just trying to get me to do this even though he doesn't have a good reason."  They all wanted good technical/economic reasons and explanations why a large block won't harm Bitcoin, but he gave a poorly-delivered but heart-felt speech reasoned on leaps of logic.  Some of them tried to even help him by giving him questions to connect rationale.  And he disappointed them by simply repeating his click-baitish talking points.

Sorry to be presumptuous.  Congratulations on stepping out there.
My comment was really aimed at illustrating that greed can often be masked as a "low risk tolerance."  People often think of the successful risk-taker as being greedy.  People rarely realize that those who won't risk their money often refuse to do so because they love their money so much that they are afraid to lose even a little of it.
There have been times in my life where $80 probably made the difference in keeping the lights on.  But now, and for the people I was aiming the comment at, $80 is routinely squandered on frivolities.  Many people in that position are too greedy to risk losing even the money they squander.  That's who I was really speaking to.
@_date: 2016-12-04 19:31:37
Haha  The factual basis for your point was totally removed.  Your solution is to pretend otherwise and still assert the position.
There is no future fork to fix the "problem" described in BIP42.
But to let you off the hook.  I'll concede that a soft fork with over a century of lead time to fix a bug in software behavior that would drastically change the economics of what everyone thought they had agreed to would be okay with me as it poses no real imminent threat to the security of Bitcoin's immutability.  I'm not a complete absolutist.  I'll make exceptions for centuries worth of lead time :)

It's a safe haven exactly because it cannot be adapted.  Human meddling is the biggest threat.


If there is one thing that should be absolutely obvious to you after the last two years, it should be this:  Bitcoin is damn near impossible to change (its consensus rules, I mean), and it's getting harder.  Moreover, now that a good number of us realize that this is a feature and not a bug, it's going to be all the more difficult.  We value the contention.  We fundamentally disagree with consensus.  And this mindset is reflected in devs, node operators, miners, exchange operator, and most importantly, large holders.
If you don't understand this, then your gains will be just good luck (assuming you hold).  But if you really like Bitcoin for its ability to "adapt," it seems you would find a better suited investment/play-thing in an altcoin like Ethereum.  It's been screwed over nicely with all of its adaptations.
**addressing your statements:**


Same shit.  The ability to fork to change Bitcoin's behavior is a threat to the record, the supply, everything.  POW can do nothing to protect against human consensus.


There is no implicit contract.  I'm good at contracts, and there is definitely is none.  The reason you say it's "implicit" is because it is for damn sure not explicit in the white paper.  Forks are hacks to change the protocol in a way that was not contemplated in the original design.  They were not part of the plan, because the plan was immutability--a necessary property for sound money.


Only theoretically.  In reality, however, consensus from a diverse group (especially when a large portion values contention) is a practical impossibility.


There always will be nothing for miners to gain from a contentious hard fork.  It will destroy the market value of their rewards.  And at this point all hard forks will almost always be contentious.  I will, however, make a disclaimer for some wild stuff like quantum computing--only because the market will be destroyed already.


I interpret the "honestly" to mean you are not really sure.  
No large miner (with a lot invested) is going to risk a fork that looks like the original chain would survive.  Prior to that point the market would have already deterred them to quit.  Then, if they decided to do it anyway, they will quickly switch back when the market doesn't suddenly decide to quit valuing the original chain (the "real" chain, the one with years of network effect) and start valuing the new one as if it were somehow the real Bitcoin.  It's business suicide for miners to do this.  So that leaves one option, a minority fork from a group of dumbasses.
That will result in creating a new chain where the people who actually value this chain only own a small portion of the tokens while the remainder are controlled by people like me who couldn't give a shit about that it.  One of the hardest things for a new alt is achieving market significance.  A "spinoff" has all of that difficulty enhanced by the massive built-in selling pressure from people who will dump anytime there is a value.  A minority spinoff is DOA, which is why nobody has ever done it in any crypto with significant market.  The obviously smarter move is just to start at a new genesis block.
The only way you'll end up with a split chain is a failed attempt at what was expected to be a successful fork (one where the old chain simultaneously dies).  And in that case, with Bitcoin's network effect, there is a very good chance the new chain is the struggler.  But the attempted hard fork is not likely, because the market will shit itself in the lead up and deter the miners threatening.

Crypto anarchist is such a dramatic term for someone who simply wants to use mathematics and technology to circumvent intellectual property law and hopefully bring about reform.  It's kind of a mundane objective, but when you call it crypto anarchy, it conjures up vivid, but mostly inaccurate, images of some serious badasses (in the late eighties and early nineties that's probably how the nerds envisioned themselves).
It's probably more connotatively accurate to call them "IP reformers."

**That ordinary users can run a node is THE last remaining factor that keeps Bitcoin decentralized and ungovernable.**

Because there is a large group of us that think that ALL hard forks should be contentious due to their threat to immutability.  Because we fundamentally oppose hard forks, all hard forks are thusly contentious. And contentious hard forks threaten to split the chain and destroy value.  The threat of value destruction results in immediate market decline, further deterring any threatened hard fork.  
We think contention is good for Bitcoin, securing immutability.  So the more you try to argue with us about it, the better.

It was stupid when you failed to realize that an intervening cause does not make an antecedent cause any less of a cause.  Under your understanding, stabbing someone can't cause death, because there must also be some other intervening cause, like profuse bleeding.  But what sense does that distinction help if the intervening cause is reasonably foreseeable (not superseding)?
Just like stabbing can cause death, so can a soft fork cause a fork.  Hence the word "fork."


That's just you stating a conclusion without rationale.  This began as a discussion of "technical" possibility.  When I said that you are clearly convinced that you are wrong about the technical impossibility of a soft fork causing a split, you got a little butthurt and wanted to move the goal post to plausibility, but without ever admitting you were wrong.  Kind of pathetic.
Then you wanted to move the discussion along, only to bring it right back to the same argument, but still with moved goal posts, and still without admitting you were wrong.
**A soft fork can cause a chain fork.** If you can't admit that, swallow your pride, and say you are wrong, then you are one pathetic person.  And a person like that can't be trusted to behave honestly when dealing with terms of degree (plausible, likely, certainly, probably, etc).  If you'll lie when you are blatantly wrong, then you'll certainly lie about your true assessment of whether something is plausible.
Let's watch you do it though:


enhances bitcoin and does not have any negative impact for anyone (with the exception of miners needing to upgrade).
Oh look, you're attempting to move the goal posts again.  Now, instead of talking about soft forks generally, you want to discuss only the SegWit soft fork.  Moreover, you are stating unsupported conclusions as facts--there are downsides to SegWit, changes to consensus rules represent a security risk.  Real genuine there.  I take it as a sign that your butt must be really hurting from the ass kicking.
Fine though.  Here's some reasons even if there is no downside to the specific proposal (not exclusive):
The market opts-out because they don't like the idea of people dicking with consensus rules.  Unintended/unforeseen consequences are a threat to anyone storing large wealth.
The market opts-out because they don't like miners attempting to force rules on them.
The market opts-out because they perceive technical downside or are uncertain.
The market opts-out as a bargaining chip.
The market opts-out because the network effect makes many perceive the old chain as the "real" chain
Here's a group of market participants vowing to opt-out:
There is a material group of market participants wanting to opt-out (including pools and exchanges).  But let me guess, it's still not plausible?  Or maybe it's plausible, but not likely (another goal post move)?
The fact is, any ability to change the consensus rules represents a threat (unforeseen/unintended consequences is a big one) to the security of Bitcoin's immutability, and that includes soft forks.  And once the market starts valuing the inability to soft fork, it will be really difficult to even get miners to threaten such, because the market will punish them.  If that happens now, it's not a big deal in Maxwell's eyes (it's a mitigation to the loss of SegWit benefits).  In my eyes, it's probably more valuable to go ahead and secure immutability.  But... If SegWit enforces, I'm good with that too.
@_date: 2017-08-14 11:10:00
Most think it's primarily attributed to SegWit lock-in.  The new feature is the obvious reason.
To see what I've stated requires a deeper understanding of Bitcoin's perceived threats and of what markets value.  If you understand these things and keep them on the forefront of your mind, then yes, what I've stated is readily apparent.
@_date: 2016-11-24 19:38:39
That's true, but the nodes don't have to rely on them and can validate.  Also, [Core devs have plans to remove them](  Under OP's plan, the chain could not operate without checkpoints, which would **require** trusting a central person for the history and validity of transactions, rather than trusting the actual verifiable blockchain.
@_date: 2016-11-29 02:55:35


If you're like all the other numb skulls who say such stupid things, the reasons are several.  
First, you're too lazy in thought to consider implications beyond about two steps.  Otherwise, you would be able to derive the concepts of price response to an inelastic supply without even the need for the term.  
Second, you're too lazy in general.  Otherwise, when spoon-fed the term perfectly inelastic supply, you would have googled it and and found a site explaining economics basics.  Upon understanding (very quickly if you're smart, but probably a little slower for you), you would have immediately recognized that Bitcoin should fit--even if only using your measly two-step thought process described above.  
Third, you're too dense to recognize glaringly clear, right-in-your-face evidence that suggests you must be wrong.  Until recently, total fees per block were less than 10% of where they presently are (even as blocks were almost full).  Then suddenly, as blocks fill and supply of transaction space is exhausted, total fees per block increase more than ten-fold with only about a 5% increase in transactions per block.  Obviously more transactions did not increase total fees per block until there were no more transactions to be had within block space.
Fourth, even if you could finally grasp this observation and you weren't too lazy to think about it and educate yourself, you're still too stupid to draw the obvious and reasonable conclusion that **miners make more money off fees when transaction demand is greater than supply and accordingly, miners are going to make less money if they activate SegWit, because doubling the available transactions will equal less money when fees decline back to the amount found when capacity is not maxed out.**

But here, I can engage in a no-holds-barred political riot with actual skin in the game.  And I can anonymously suffer no real-world recourse when I take off the gloves.  So when (which poses the biggest, but still small, threat) screws up like this, I get excited to capitalize.  But don't get the wrong impression, this kind of excitement comes with a big smug grin--I wouldn't want to calm down.

More adoption can mean two things.  (1) Increase to the number of people and (2) increase in the amount of capital.
We could lose thousands of people who simply purchase weed with Bitcoin and still see a massive increase in price if we simply pick up 20 entities who adopt Bitcoin as a safe haven store of value.
You don't want to conflate attracting lots of people with attracting lots of capital.  And big money is not interested in coffee purchases.  But those people are very concerned with the security of immutability.  When they know Bitcoin can't be changed--even for great stuff--they will begin to become comfortable that Bitcoin is not subject to any potential bad changes.  This is when it will become a true safe haven.

But Satoshi's directly referencing Adam Back in the body text (the only person) is probative that Back might have been Satoshi.  That Adam Back was discussing these things with Todd and Finney years prior to Bitcoin is probative that any of them could have been Satoshi.  The fact that the hashcash white paper and the Bitcoin white paper are in the exact same format is probative that Back had a hand in writing it.
Of course, none of these things are proof (which I wouldn't want to do anyway), but for you to say "there is NO reason to believe" is a humorous demonstration of your insecure business position.
If these guys (and have enough influence, they could easily remove yours.  Their influence is an existential threat to your business.  Imagine if Satoshi signed his coins and delivered a proposal to replace SHA256; you would be screwed.

Hashcash was the cornerstone.  Hashcash provided the opportunity for trustlessness.  Every other piece of Bitcoin was selected based on extending hashcash.  The blockchain, for instance, is only used because "blocking" transactions together provides a method of using hashcash to provide an objective method for nodes to form consensus around which transactions will be deemed the valid transactions.
Interesting observation.  The word "blockchain" or "block chain" was not once used in the Bitcoin white paper.  Satoshi did refer to blocks of transactions and chaining them together (i.e. a blockchain).  But with all of the blockchain hype by media types, many might think that Satoshi was looking to find a way to get a blockchain to be trustless, and hashcash just so happened to work.  But that's not the case.  Satoshi began with hashcash because of its opportunity to bypass the need for a central authority.  Everything else was built around this notion.  The problem that Bitcoin solved was trustlessness.  And Bitcoin did this by extending hashcash.  As you noted, almost everything else was already in existence (e.g., Wei Dai's ideas).

That logic does not follow.  The companies you are referencing that are in danger are the ones that expected Layer 1 Bitcoin to be a large payment system that could compete with PayPal on volume and fees.  Those companies are going to have trouble, because Layer-1 can never compete with PayPal (it's too slow and clunky).  That's not its best use.  And any attempt to do that destroys Bitcoin's best properties.  [Some profiteers may be fine attempting that method]( but even they know that it leaves Bitcoin as a terrible store of wealth only for it to become an inadequate method of payment.  Companies who need Layer 1 to be a quick high-volume low-fee payment system did not understand what Bitcoin was when they signed on.  When I signed on in 2012, I always knew that the 1MB limit was going to be a difficult, if not impossible, limit to change.
The companies who need Layer-1 to be a high-volume, low-fee payment system may be in trouble.  But the store of wealth companies are not.  Exchanges flourish (when they are secure and reputable).  There are many many of those companies that are doing well (even localbitcoins.com).  They do well, because their models fit nicely with what Layer 1 is suited for.
We don't have just the type companies you listed and Core developers.  We have many of thriving companies whose models are centered around serving users who are helping Layer-1 secure a status as a secure, non-inflationary, store of wealth that is better than any the world has seen.  State monopolies on money have deprived people of these for nearly a century.  
After having their gold taken and their money inflated, people have turned to all sorts of places to store wealth.  Land, Bonds, and Equities are the most common, but the list is endless.  Most of these lack the fungibility, liquidity, transferability, etc to make them truly great stores of wealth.  Accordingly people devise all sorts of risk diversification plans (e.g. Mutual funds) that hopefully allow people to earn just enough to keep pace with inflation.  Why do people do this?  Because there is no good place to store wealth when governments force them to use their form of money and insist on printing much more of it.  The market is forced to inflate the market value for traded instruments just to have a place to "save" money for retirement.
Bitcoin is postured to restore to the market a truly safe place to store wealth.  And it can only do that if it cannot be governed.  Many companies that are designed to help Layer-1 Bitcoin succeed in that are thriving.  And to me, and many others, succeeding in Layer-1 is far more important than a fast, high-volume payment system.  And we recognize that all forks are a threat to that (hard or soft).
To prove my point, [here is the top post on this morning.](  Those ideas should sound similar to the ones I shared with you in our conversation.  People realize that a secure layer-1 will have store of wealth as its killer app.  And that should not be jeopardized.
Of course, I'm all for great payment systems, but not at a cost to Layer-1's security of immutability.  It's a horrible trade-off.  But it appears the trade-offs are not even necessary.  It appears that Layer-2 stuff can work fine with Bitcoin just the way it is.  So my strong inclination is no more forks.  But I was willing to compromise for SegWit due to the benefits, and because it would seem it should please the coffee purchasers.  I understand that it makes Layer-2 stuff more feasible.  But if it gets rejected by the people I was trying to compromise with, then great, Layer-1 is secured faster.  It's a win/win.
I actually think Circle will be best off if Layer-2 stuff is not developed.  Otherwise, there will be no demand for their services.  But that's not going to happen, the war for Layer-2 was won without even a fight when CLTV and CSV were implemented.

That's conjecture, but switching algorithms would be done when there is already PROOF that the current SHA256/ASIC system has been centralized to allow for a 51% attack.  In other words, there is no choice but to try another, because the security of immutability is already destroyed.

I would never support someone like Ver.  You guys act like it is reasonable that people support a convicted felon who has to have permission to enter the U.S., who lied to this community as Gox was collapsing.  It's as though you think that the real reason people dislike him is because of his political stance on block sizes.  But that's not it for me (and other reasonable people).  Ver is a weasel, and that transcript demonstrates it well.  He has spent considerable resources white-washing his conviction and spinning it as a political attack against himself.  Linking to the docket is very reasonable.  Pulling out his transcript to show his weasely attempt to avoid saying he has capacity to enter his plea illustrates his character.  The video of him backing Gox illustrates his character.  He is untrustworthy.  It takes no twisting of words to see that.  Just look at the transcript.  I already posted a particular portion.  In order to save space, I'll link to it here.

Some do.  But for the ones that want much bigger blocks, their interest is control.  They want to push out the competition and the users' ability veto.  Those don't get that with SegWit.  Others are just looking at the pure economics.  For them, I don't think the revenue reduction is too much of a deterrence.  But if they thought it would result in revenue increase they would be in a much bigger hurry.

The inability to change the block size is not central planning.  It's a constant that can't be changed, regardless of the planning.
Wu's plan would result in a few miners (including himself) being able to plan.  And really, "planning" doesn't give the proper connotation.  Wu would "plot" and "scheme" for his own gain against the best long term interests of Bitcoin.  This is clear in the tweet and other actions.
Miners are the mercenaries of the system.  Presently, no one is trusted to "plan."  If anyone were going to be, miners should be last in line.

If you love Ethereum's complexity, you are going to love sidechains.  Those are next in Bitcoin and will probably serve your intellectual curiosity even better.  In the meantime, Ethereum is probably more fun for you.
On a side note, I hold some as a hedge.  Eventually, if ETH continues to catch on (as a store of wealth), it will become just as immutable.  But I doubt it will continue to catch on in that way.  Big Money won't be stored there, but it will probably catch on for some application.

The point of Nakamoto consensus is that there can never be a compromise.  That's what ensures immutability.  The requirement of consensus is the guarantee of Gridlock.  Soon enough (if not already), that will even apply to soft forks.

No he doesn't.  With regard to the "threat,"  Ver tried to equivocate.  He wanted to find another definition of threat to say he was "threatened," then use the fact that he was "threatened" to create an appeal error (of course using two definitions of the word threatened, one which includes a physical threat).  It's called an equivocation and the judge is too smart for it.
With regard to capacity, he tried hard to leave the implication that he did not have capacity.  Here is the rest of the exchange (with a little commentary):
THE COURT: Would it be better to do this a different day?
THE DEFENDANT: I'm prepared to do this today.
THE COURT: Again, I don't want to have a problem later because on reflection you don't believe you understood what you were doing. Does the medicine you take affect your judgment to the extent that you don't understand the questions I'm asking you?
THE DEFENDANT: **I don't think so**, Your Honor. (Just say no, Your Honor)
THE COURT: All right. Does it affect your understanding of the importance of this particular proceeding?
THE DEFENDANT: **I hope not**, Your Honor. I'm sure my mental capacity isn't, you know, up to par compared to how it would be normally (Ver thinks he is going to somehow create an appealable error, all he is really going to do is piss the judge off who has some discretion over his sentence, although they usually just stick to the guidelines).
THE COURT: Well, I want to be clear here that if you have any doubt about your ability to comprehend and understand what's taking place we should -- we should do it another time. This is truly a case of haste makes waste. If you plead guilty today and decide two weeks from now that I really didn't mean to do that and if it hadn't been for that medicine I wouldn't have, it's going to be a very messy thing for everybody concerned *especially you.* So if you have any question in your mind about your ability to think clearly this morning, I will continue this to another day.
THE DEFENDANT: In all honesty (bullshit incoming) I think that that might upset, you know, two of the attorneys present and I'm willing to sign today. (This is where he gets really silly, but judge is too smart)
THE COURT: But, you see, I appreciate your concern for them, but if sometime in the future you have buyer's remorse about this plea agreement, to be very blunt about it, and you say, "I didn't understand what was happening and I didn't knowingly and intelligently give up my rights and I didn't understand the consequence of my plea," then that would have to be litigated. I don't want to create a situation where that's going to occur. So I have to ask you again if you have any doubt about your ability mentally to proceed this morning, then we should proceed at a different time.
THE DEFENDANT: I'm prepared to sign today. I feel I can do so knowingly and intelligently. (Bitcoin Jesus Christ! Did he really think he was going to pull some juvenile shit with the judge and get out of this? Just answer the questions the way your attorney told you to and accept your sentence. You've had way more than plenty of time before the hearing to decide whether you want to plead guilty.)
THE COURT: Okay. Let me then discuss with you the elements of each of these offenses ...
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:54:21
You hold two very inconsistent views.
(1)  You think "the current situation as trusted. Mining is too centralised to be trustless."  Therefore, "Most of the Bitcoin problems get solve by decentralisation of mining."
(2)  You think we should trust miners.




Philosophically, you argue out of one side of your mouth that we should decentralize mining to make it more trustless.  Then out of the other side, you argue that the miners are most trustworthy.
If they are trustworthy, then why do you want to remove that trust?  You don't.  Instead, you know that you'll never win all of Bitcoin arguing to trust the miners, so you argue that Bigger blocks will lead to decentralization.  Of course, you know this argument also fails, but when it does you argue that we should trust miners because they are the most trustworthy.
There is no way to make these arguments honestly.  The truth is you want control given to the miners.  And your plan for that is to argue to get what you really want:


You want that because it puts the miners in control and that is in your interest.


Bullshit.  You're related to a major mining pool/manufacturer.

Well thank you.  I'm surprised at how well you take this ridicule.  You're a good sport.  But you have horrible insight when it comes to these political chicaneries you attempted to ruin Maxwell with.


We already did.  If you were good at this, you would have played your hand differently.  Instead, you respond like every prisoner sitting in a cell; you pretend you're not guilty.  It's working for you like it's working for them.  The readers have already been persuaded that you lied, because you did, and we have shown them.
Your best bet was simply to leave it alone.  By insisting against the obvious, you've called attention to even more readers and further absolved your target.  You've actually made him a martyr.  If you were sincere, you would have simply apologized for saying he doxxed anybody.

No it's not.  These two can be analogized, but so can a frog and your big toe.


Try to stop using fiat money.  You can't because you're dependent, because everyone else uses it.  And even if every individual would like to switch, they need collective, contemporaneous (maybe simultaneous) agreement from a large portion of other individuals in order to be able to do so.
If Bitcoin is governable, it will act as a Trojan horse that attracts people first with decentralized properties.  Then, once they are dependent, it will become exactly like what it replaced--its supply will be governed by manmade order (i.e., fiat).

**To the readers:**
I want to put this in context.  About 5 days ago I had a long conversation that began with Ant-n denying that he is associated with a large mining pool or ASIC manufacturer.  (Of course, I know he is lying.)
During the conversation he was arguing that we need to decentralize mining by increasing the block size cap (go figure), because we need to keep Bitcoin trustless.  Then at the same time (not realizing how obvious he is), he argues that miners can and should be trusted with the long term interests of Bitcoin.
I pointed out the contradictory position and then used the fact that Antpool mines empty blocks (among other things) as evidence that they cannot be trusted.  Then I ended the conversation with a question:
"Do you still think miners can be trusted?"
He did not respond (very unlike him, he is a last-word guy).
Four days later, a guy claiming to be the manager of AntPool (a guy who rarely posts) claims that AntPool is changing their transaction selection method to quit mining empty blocks because they care about the "long term" interest of Bitcoin.  See the Ant-n link.
And Ant-n now responds to my question by linking to that post.  He realized that in order to give the appearance of propriety he had to change their transaction selection.  The purported reason of "long term" concern for Bitcoin is pretext.  The real reason is that AntPool desperately wants to deceive the market into handing control over to the miners.  Pretty funny.  If long term interest was the real reason, they would have never mined empty blocks, and they would not have increased soft limits (against dev warning) causing the need for a relay network.
The middle of the conversation is linked here.

No source.  Only an inference that you would likely agree with.  All Rootstock would need to do is join the DPL.  It only applies to those who join, so there is no harm to Rootstock for doing so, unless they plan to make offensive use of patents, even against other DPL users.  Everything Sergio is "concerned" with is fixed by this one simple act.  But Sergio seems to be attempting to distract from that fact and he never even addresses Rootstock's intent with regard to the DPL.
Peter Todd cornered him on Twitter, but it was not obvious to the casual observer.  And Sergio deflected well enough.


Sergio had the opportunity to speak about it, but simply said,


I like Rootstock too and am all for what they are doing.  But it seems Sergio is engaging in sharp practices here by trying to claim Blockstream is doing something "bad," when, in fact, it is Rootstock that is at least contemplating offensive patent enforcement.  Because if Rootstock were resolved not to do such, they would simply join the DPL.

I'm not nearly as fluent on the technology as I am on the economics and politics of Bitcoin.  I'm able to understand a lot, but I tend to rely on devs for explanations.
With that said, even if Bitcoin stays exactly the way it is, the big battles were won without much of a fight.  Those were CLTV and CSV.  Those enable advanced sidechain pegging.  SegWit is practically of no help for sidechains.  The utility you (and I) hope to see can, and will, be available in sidechains.  And that might even be better.  (There is value in a very open record.)  But I think I would prefer privacy and fungibility on L1.

The hardware does nothing to secure Bitcoin if it is not diversified in ownership.  Nothing.
The work all of those hashed do does nothing to actually process or even verify transactions.  It's just arbitrary meaningless work to find a hash that's value is less than current difficulty requires.  The amount of hash power is only impressive as a security feature to people who don't understand the purpose of POW.  And if the hash power comes under control of a few, it does not secure Bitcoin, it does the opposite.
I'm not saying we are there yet, but we are very close to having a centrally controlled Bitcoin because of the decade of ASIC development.  Hopefully there will soon be more competition and better distribution.

No problem.  You should read Maxwell's post (again).  It really illustrates that he too agrees that once forks are contentious (hard then soft), there is likely no turning back.  He likens the security of immutability to the security of free speech.


We know we free speech (on matters of public concern) is truly secured because of [Snyder v. Phelps](  Likewise, when SegWit is blocked, we'll know that Bitcoin's immutability is secured.

I agree we need a backlog.  But for years, when devs were telling miners not to raise the soft limit, they did it anyway.  By your definition, they were working against the best interest of the network for what they perceived was their own best interest.

Any ability to change Bitcoin's consensus rules is a threat to the mutability of the record and the supply.  Just look at ETH and ETC.  ETH changed the record.  ETC is now planning to change the supply (decrease inflation).
The methods to go about changing consensus rules are exactly the same.  Also, messing with the protocol at this level introduces the possibility for bugs and unintended consequences.  The market will like none of this.
@_date: 2016-12-12 15:05:51
But if the original chain attains its higher market value, how will new chain keep 51% of the miners?  It could, but pure economics would suggest that the miners on the new chain will move back to the old chain where it's more profitable.  This would leave the new chain somewhat crippled until a difficulty adjustment, then the new miners (the diehards) wouldn't have the requisite hash power to affect a reorg.  Permanent fork.
Don't get confused here.  All I have to show is that is possible.  But I have shown that it is likely.  This might tend to cause you to think that you can win by arguing it unlikely.  That would be error.

Who the hell is trying to redesign?  Only those wanting to TRUST miners--centralized miners--with the maximum size of blocks.
You guys want to redesign Bitcoin despite the fact that Bitcoin is designed to be trustLESS and despite the fact that miners have already proven untrustworthy with the block size.  Against developer warnings, miners continued to increase the block size beyond the soft limits.  And to repair their damage, the relay network was needed.  This is centralizing.  Against developer admonition, miners moved to centralized stratum instead of getblocktemplate (further centralizing).  And while Wu demands even more centralizing with block size, he hypocritically produces empty blocks.
I don't thank miners.  I reward them by holding Bitcoin and helping give it a market value.  And that's the only reason they (generally) do anything they do.  They are mercenaries.

You have a misunderstanding.  I wouldn't be a part of some dumbass user-lead movement like in the fork sub.  I would be a part of an algorithm switch if it included massive support from the Core devs.  They are the ones that have given a skeletal outline of the process.
When Luke-jr threatened it, the current miners quivered, because they know they can be replaced.  That's primarily what lead to the HK agreement.  The miners were rattling sabers about forcing a hard fork, and Luke-jr explained how to change algorithms and they acquiesced.
@_date: 2016-12-28 02:54:47
Depends on how you look at it.  Right now it may seem unreasonable to view it this way, but in time, it will seem like other currencies fluctuate 24/7 against Bitcoin.  In time, Bitcoin will become the frame of reference.  Of course, that will require a much higher market cap.

I have a strong finance background.  The use of debt is always an increase of risk (Optimum Capital Structure is about finding the appropriate amount of risk by adjusting debt).  I came from the oil and gas business and sold most of my interests before becoming a lawyer, but I still have some interests (mostly non-operating interests where I am a passive investor, or royalty interests).
We use debts to drill wells and we are quite sophisticated.  The model would be very similar to a Bitcoin mining model that operates on debt.  Because we cannot control market values, and because of other uncertainties debts almost always influence our decisions in favor of short-term payouts rather than long-term revenue maximization.
Over leveraged oil companies is THE number one reason there is a supply glut.  Oil companies know that over-production will harm them, but they also know that 10% earned on debt is like free money.  Accordingly, they borrow a bunch of capital, then drill wells, and produce them as fast as they can before the market declines (there is only so much hedging can do).  This leads to economic waste, because often wells will produce more if choked to a lower level that slows formation deterioration.  But debt causes companies to sacrifice the long-term for the short-term assurance of debt payment.
Worse, knowing that a supply glut is coming that will lower price, instead of slowing down, they increase the rate of drilling to capture the opportunity before it is gone.  Then when the few who did not slow down in time are caught in a bad situation, they become forced to continue to produce wells at a high rate just to service their notes, even though they know that they are exacerbating the supply problem and they know that the wells would be more profitable if they waited until the market price returned.
I see no reason why debt is somehow a creates a long-term interest.  I suppose it's possible in some scenarios, but in this one Miners using debt to finance mining equipment will create even more short-term pressure to cover their notes.  They know that any equipment they finance will quickly become obsolete.  Accordingly, they must reduce their enhanced risk (caused by debt) by extracting as much revenue out of their quickly-becoming-obsolete mining rigs.  Otherwise, they are stuck with debt that they cannot service once their rigs cannot compete.
If miners are using debt.  This should literally make them less aligned with the long-term.  I'm not saying that as some opposite-of-you-say thing.  I'm saying it because it is true.
Are there any other reasons you think they are aligned with the long-term?
@_date: 2016-12-11 14:11:49


Sure it would.  Some miners may block it as a negotiation strategy (want a hard fork).  And some in the market may block it (deter miners) because they consider it a risky (change is scary) challenge to the security of Bitcoin's immutability.  And other miners may already feel deterred from blocking it, because implementation removes the fee pressure that has caused about a 5% increase in revenue (over rewards).
If SegWit gets blocked, it's totally understandable.  If it passes, that's understandable too (cool enhancement).  But because I greatly value the unchanging nature of Bitcoin's behavior, I see refusal to implement just as valuable (if not more) than implementing (although implementing is fine too).  At some point, though, we need to put an end to all forks (soft or hard).  Bitcoin needs to become change resistant.

He wants control.  And he's too stupid to win influence on merit.
It's really simple; just think of Machiavellian principles.  Simply view everything he does as an attempt (deceptive or not) to either increase his wealth or increase his status/influence.  Then realize that he has no moral boundaries and that his only limitations are based on whether he can maintain plausible deniability.
He needs plausible deniability for two reasons, a rationalized one and the real one.  Plausible deniability mitigates influential damage, but his real reason is that he is a coward.  ([Understanding Commodus makes it easy.](
People should have seen this from miles away.  I did, and sounded alarms as far back as 2013 (and never quit).  But back then, most were all bought-in on his purchased title, "Bitcoin Jesus."
But I was not naive.  I've been around long enough to sniff out bullshit no matter how much cheap cologne is poured over it.  And I know people don't get convicted of federal felonies for selling "fireworks."  I know people concerned with honesty don't vouch for an exchange that is clearly failing.  Honest people need more than plausible deniability, they are usually too fearful of actually being wrong and accidentally perpetrating harm on others.  Accordingly, when I see Ver vouching, I know he doesn't care as long as he has "plausible deniability."  The deniability may be plausible to the ordinary person (who has trouble believing people can be calculating), but to someone like me (seasoned lawyer and businessman who has dealt with plenty of snakes) it's implausible; honest people only vouch when they are sure, and even then with hesitation.  (How do you feel about giving job recommendations for people you don't know well?)
To understand Ver is simple.  If it can boost his net worth, ego, or power (the latter two are most important), then he will engage in any deception, so long as he thinks he can explain it away (cowardice).
It's pretty funny to go look at him attempt to do this in his transcripts from his sentencing and plea entry hearings.  It's also funny to compare the record to his account.

These discussions almost always miss the most important factor--market pressure.
Miners want the Bitcoin price high, but the market wants the threat of a chain split at zero.  If 51% were threatening to split the chain, the market would react highly unfavorably to both chains.  And with only 51% behind such a move, there would certainly be two chains (both with 20 minute blocs until the next difficulty retarget, and both with low value).
So what your discussing might be technically true in a vacuum (it might not be; didn't give much consideration), but in practice it is not plausible.

Wouldn't the patent pledge serve only for estoppel?  And if so, is it reasonable for any sophisticated party to rely on such when there is no consideration and no privity?  And if reliance is reasonable, wouldn't that cease to be true once notified that the pledge is revoked?

I'm asking mostly out of curiosity.  I think what Blockstream has done is great--as good as they can possibly do.  Potential users of Blockstream innovations are better off with the pledge, than without.

Even the best intentions often lead to unintended consequences.  Bugs are rarely intentional or foreseen and when Billions of dollars are at stake, the risk is not worth the benefits.




This is bad news.  But notice, the mining cartel has not tried to implement a change that was not user/dev led.  The reason is because they know they can't without substantial loss of wealth.  The miners like rewards high.  The market deters them from even threatening changes by lowering the value of their rewards.  Of course, I would prefer that mining control be way more diverse.




Any ability to change consensus rules poses a threat to Bitcoin's immutability.  The danger is removed when contention is present.  For that reason, as time passes, more and more will contend any change and because of market deterrence, the biggest holders will have the loudest voice.  And they are the ones who will be most intolerant to attempts to change.  And when Bitcoin cannot make even good changes, those people will come.

While you think it is naïve, [Greg Maxwell understands and sees the value in the proposition.](







It's mitigated because of the added security to Bitcoin's immutability.  Where the two of us differ is simply on the value to place on the immutability and the advantages of SegWit.  He presently values SegWit more, and I am leaning towards immutability. 

Whether you like it or not Bitcoin was designed to eventually reach gridlock.  Bitcoin was designed in this manner because, unlike any previous software, this software was attempting to replicate all of the properties requisite to sound money.  Certain properties of a store of wealth must be immutable for it to be adopted.  Bitcoin assures that by requiring consensus.  If SegWit passes, then great.  If not, then also great.  Win/Win.

Satoshi referred to payment channels as "unrecorded open transactions."  They later took on the name "payment channel."  (Similarly, the white paper never once mentioned "blockchain" or "block chain", but referred only to chaining blocks together).  
And then he referred to "high frequency trading" as the function of making payments back and forth to never be recorded on the chain until closing the payment (i.e., payment channel).  He would do this by constantly "replacing" the contents of the "open transaction."
Here is a link to the 0.1 code where such a replacement was allowed
That's the origin of the payment channel.
Also some interesting history.  I am sure you have seen the 2009 email Hearn claimed was from Satoshi, where he claimed [Bitcoin could scale beyond Visa levels](
But what I doubt you have seen (because it was conveniently left out) is the explanation Satoshi gave Hearn, which was basically a conceptual Lightning Network (minus the routing) using payment channels.




It's really an interesting read to realize how far down the road they (meaning Satoshi) were thinking.
**Regardless, I think you have your "PROOF ME" of payment channels (i.e., replaceable unrecorded open transactions) in the first iteration of Bitcoin.  From now on do your own homework.**

And the only reason the attacks are attacks is because the max requirement is unreasonably high.


Duh...  But the problem we are trying to prevent is the situation where it is only viable for someone with a strong economic incentive (businesses) to run nodes.
In that situation, Bitcoin is suddenly governable at choke points, because ordinary users can't afford to run nodes. **And if ordinary users don't like the direction, they can't even solo mine to change it, because they can't afford to run a node**--they must follow the pool operators. **Ordinary users couldn't even implement an algorithm change.**
**That ordinary users can run a node is THE last remaining factor that keeps Bitcoin decentralized and ungovernable.**
In fact, for this reason, it is very important that nodes are able to operate efficiently over Tor.
If we leave the protocol control to the larger entities, we have opened the door to fiat rule over Bitcoin.  That is already the case for Ethereum (and it will get worse).

It requires a hard fork.  At this point all hard forks are contentious, because too many of us are fundamentally opposed to the threat to immutability that hard forks pose.  And to further complicate the matter, the market values the security of immutability caused by the inability to hard fork (uncertainty = risk = lower price).  Because the market values the security of immutability, any threat to hard fork results in a value decline.  And because big miners like the value of their rewards being high, they won't even threaten a hard fork.
Pretty soon, if not already, the same reluctance that exists for hard forks will form also against soft forks as well.  The market will value the additional certainty, and the inability to soft fork will be secured.    At this point Bitcoin will be solidified.
I, and others, are happy to solidify Bitcoin.  We are good if SegWit cannot be deployed.  The only reason we acquiesce was the benefits seemed like a reasonable compromise for the coffee purchasers.
But if the coffee purchasers refuse the compromise, then fine.  They don't understand that we actually value "indefinite stalemate."  They think that if they block SegWit we will cave.  What they don't understand is that if SegWit is blocked, my side gets its way faster.
It's really kind of funny.  They can't figure out why we have not budged.  They think we are the most stubborn assholes to ever exist.  They don't realize that we value the contention.  They don't realize that the contention is what secures the immutability of Bitcoin.  How damn frustrating must this exercise in futility be for them?
The louder they scream and the harder they fight, the more they prove to the market that Bitcoin simply cannot be altered.  This fighting that leads to stalemate is the proof that Bitcoin is a true safe haven.

The requirement of large nodes is as easily governed as banks.  We need nodes that can run over Tor.  User base can grow through payment channels, or ["unrecorded open transactions,"]( as Satoshi called them.


Yes they can solo mine **if they are doing so to resist a miner-imposed fork.**  Risisting an unwanted fork can be done with far less hash rate than the network has, and it won't be done for the profitability of the reward.  **But this is only possession nor if ordinary users can run nodes.**

If Bitcoin can survive the nearly complete centralization of mining it ~~can survive the centralization of nodes~~ will be because resource requirement is low enough such that miners can be kept in check by the fact that ordinary users can run nodes.  If they can't run nodes, miners and larger interests are in control because ordinary users can't even fork away.  And because ordinary users can't run nodes (over Tor), Bitcoin is governable at all three choke points, mining pools, exchanges, and nodes.

**To the reader:**
This guy is aligned with large mining pools/ASIC manufacturers.  The biggest threat to his business is that there could be someone with the political clout to persuade a POW algorithm change away from SHA256.  That's all this post is about.
Adam Back invented hashcash, which is the cornerstone that Bitcoin was designed around.  Satoshi designed around hashcash specifically because it required no central authority.  Like many of the posts here explain, the problem with all of the previous digital currencies was the use of central authorities that could be shut-down by government.  So, with that aim in mind, Satoshi attempted to solve the centralized problem by using hashcash combined with other already-used techniques.  Many of the new inventions that make-up Bitcoin (e.g., the "blockchain") were inventions of necessity to allow for the usage of hashcash-POW.
Because hashcash was somewhat of a cornerstone, Adam Back was the only person Satoshi credited within the body text of the Bitcoin white paper.  OP is routinely attempting to discredit Adam Back because he is afraid that Dr. Back could harm OP's mining interests.
**Below is some interesting history on the thinking that lead to the creation of Bitcoin.**
In 2001, when Peter Todd was about 15 years old, he was communicating back and forth with Adam Back and Hal Finney about adapting hashcash for use as "virtual gold".  Todd was "retep at penguinpowered."  Here are some excerpts:








**Then the Conclusion section of the Bitcoin white paper explains how Bitcoin was designed to get around the requirement of a central authority by using hashcash PoW.**


And not just any proof-of-work would do. It "needed" to operate without a central authority.


[Bitcoin white paper](
Those who want to discredit Dr. Back's importance will try to point to Dwork and Naor as the inventors of Proof of Work.  Indeed, [Dr. Back cites them in his paper.](  But their form of POW required centralized "pricing authorities."  It was also much more convoluted.  Dr. Back's hashcash was simplistic and required no central authority.  And that's why it was selected as the cornerstone in a thought project to solve the problem that plagued digital currencies: the need for a central authority.
Again, look at Todd's words in response to someone criticizing the use of hashcash due to its wastefulness:


These are the ideas that lead to the creation of Bitcoin.  Who actually did it is a mystery.  But someone finally solved the puzzle based on Todd's push to extend Back's hashcash to create a "virtual gold."
**TL;DR: Don't be fooled by OP.  He knows Dr. Back's significance to Bitcoin.  But that significance is a threat to his mining interests if it could lead to political influence.  Accordingly, he wants to discredit Adam Back and hashcash.**

Try again.  Each block is hashed based on the previous block.  The block based on the new rules would have to be built on a block the new nodes reject in order for the old nodes to accept it.  Otherwise the POW hash would not check out.  A soft fork can cause a permanent split.  And if it is contentious and with a low enough threshold (or high enough market disapproval) it will result in a split.

The white paper says to follow the longest chain.  And after implementing that rule, Satoshi quickly changed it (realizing they were wrong) to chain with the most work.  Likewise, realizing that miners could not be trusted not to kill the network with too-large blocks, Satoshi implemented a cap.

Jeremy Allaire would rape Bitcoin and turn it into [PayPal 2.0 if it would make Circle profitable]( But our developers understand that Bitcoin is not here to put Visa/PayPal out of business (definitely not to make Circle money).

Spreading the good news of Bitcoin is more important than being liked.  Either way, no worries; I have all the friends and family I need in my weekly Bitcoin meet-up club.  In fact, most of us meet more often than weekly.  We have fellowships during the week when we congregate for in-home white-paper studies while we partake in bread breaking.  (White-paper study is really a too-narrow misnomer, because we go way deeper than that and include in our studies all texts handed down by Satoshi Nakamoto.)  Pretty much everyone from the  Sunday meet-ups attends the weekly fellowships after they have become well-enough acquainted to be worthy of an invite.
Our club is really all about serving humanity.  Our primary mission is to make sure there is no one in this world who hasn't heard about and had the opportunity to lay down their fiat ways and experience new life with Bitcoin.  One of the things we have done is codified all of the scriptures of Satoshi Nakamoto into leather-bound booklets.  This includes not only his white-paper, but all of his online posts (the ones where consensus has determined they are actually his writings... before his departure).  In addition to his writings, we include many of the epistles of his earliest followers (most can be found in unorganized disarray on Bitcointalk.org).  We bind all of these writings in a neat order that should give any reader in the world the greatest chance of understanding the truth and the way that is Bitcoin.
Of course we don't just hand out the scriptures to anyone.  Only our neighbors who are receptive to our pamphlets receive a copy of the scriptures.  But we've found that in well-developed societies, these incidents are few (with the exception of the downtrodden and potential clandestine online market customers).  Accordingly, we've begun focusing and organizing our efforts around developing nations.  Presently, my mission calling is Venezuela.  But the hidden hand of Satoshi could move me at any moment.  I keep expecting a movement to India.
My current work is somewhat lonely, because I miss my fellowship group back home.  Fortunately, we are able to communicate using cryptographically secure channels that stay hidden from the prying eyes of the Venezuelan authorities who are constantly seeking out humanitarians such as myself.
I find that the hungry people in this nation are much more receptive than spoiled people of the United States.  Accordingly, when I bring pamphlets, I also carry more copies of the scriptures (we have people back home who serve as translation scribes).  And while the message is well-received, it is even better-received when I also bring and share muffins to partake in.  The reception is so great that we have started providing clandestine mining rigs that allow the most interested to bypass official restraints by directly mining Bitcoin (using free socialist electricity) to purchase items over western websites (to be delivered by secret heroic couriers).
We have started a movement.  This is what our group is all about.  We will revolutionize this world with Bitcoin.  Our name is "We."  And "We" are all Satoshi.  His spirit lives on through us.  So rather than making snarky comments about my neighbors disliking me, why don't you do your part and join we?

This is called an equivocation.  By attaching three different meanings to the word "unclear", he is attempting to mislead the reader while making a "true" statement.

Not necessarily.  And these are things of degree.  Likewise, "medium of exchange" is very broad in degrees.
Land, mutual funds, diamonds, and artwork are all somewhat stable stores of value, that are used as mediums of exchange (just not in high volumes).  While Bitcoin began as an unstable "store of value," as its market cap increases it becomes more stable.  This does not require high volume usage as a medium of exchange.  It requires high capital volume usage as a store of value.  The more capital adoption, the more stable (it takes more capital to move the market the same percentage).

You are not reading carefully.  I don't think they are equally risky.  But they both require consensus.  And the ability to attain consensus is a threat to Bitcoin's immutability.


Or you're just lacking in reading comprehension.  Or you are so antsy to want to attack that you are temporarily unable to read carefully.
Now you need to get your panties out of a wad and be calm, content, and reasonable.  You need to understand that your preconceived notions are being challenged by someone who has always wanted nothing but the best for Bitcoin, and that's okay.

I'm very pro Bitcoin.  Been holding for years.  I just don't think that defeating fees is our proper aim.  We aren't gunning for local banks.  We are gunning for central banks.  If we can cut down on fees and oversight at the same time, then great.

You didn't understand, because you have fixed preconceived notions that prevent you from readily comprehending (even recognizing) something contradictory.  I'm not talking about a single-orphan block.  I'm talking about a full-blown fork that began as what one would hope would only be a single-block orphan.  The lower the threshold, and the higher the contention, the more likely it is that this happens.  You said a soft fork can be accomplished with a simple "majority."  An attempt will almost certainly result in a complete fork with all of the miners on the chain with new rules moving back to the original chain.  Go back and re-read.


I agree they are less problematic, but not "far" less.  They are technically less problematic, because they are less likely to result in a fork (given the same high threshold).  Nonetheless, that consensus can be garnered for changes to consensus rules is problematic to the security of immutability.  Consensus should be really hard to do.  And because there are a growing number who share, consensus is moving towards impossibility.


Bad changes to consensus can only be introduced if consensus is achievable.  That should be obvious.  Greg Maxwell probably gave the best analogy when he compared this to Free Speech.






Don't equivocate.  You know damn well in this context, consensus is short hand for the requisite agreement among the right people to fork with low risk of the original chain surviving.  To all of the sudden refer to consensus as meaning its denotative (100% agreement among absolutely everyone) is petty.  People everywhere refer to the idea of general consensus.  People in Bitcoin refer to consensus as the amount of agreement among enough people to effect a safe fork.

Make one up.  Or just believe one that somebody else makes up.  China, Venezuela, India, Trump, MMM, etc.
This is the one I made up:
Prior to the halving, lots of people bought, expecting a rise, as rewards halved.  But there were not enough of those buyers to fully account for the entire rise to be caused by the halving.  Over the last few months, those buyers have been selling and now we've finally hit the point where new supply of Bitcoin (combined with sellers) cannot meet demand.  Price rise.  Of course, there are other factors as well, but this is pretty much exactly what I expected (but about two months delayed).
@_date: 2016-12-04 19:52:03
I'd probably be willing to make even greater concessions.  I might be good with a year lead time with a high threshold.
But I'm pretty sure my point is clear; it should be damn hard to change Bitcoin's consensus rules, even for good stuff.  The market will like that, and blocking SegWit will send that message (because it is so good).

This is pretext.  The benefits from mining a few empty blocks are not worth the negative image that could cost Wu his campaign for complete control.
AntPool's decision to stop mining empty blocks is a direct result of a Reddit conversation I had with someone closely related to Jihan Wu (or Wu himself).  The conversation took place about a week ago.
This guy (, who is clearly aligned with miner incentives) keeps arguing for actions that will lead to miner control.  He does so by arguing that his calls to action will actually lead to less miner control.  Then when you show him otherwise, he argues that that's okay, because miners are trustworthy.  I used AntPool's abuse of trust in transaction selection to demonstrate a general untrustworthiness.  He responded by having the "manager" of AntPool claim to be changing their transaction policy to benefit the "long term."

Haha.  That's a pretty accurate description, but you have to have a lot of esoteric knowledge to realize how.  But yes.  Bitcoin was designed with the idea to bypass the need for a central authority in a payment system by using hashcash as a cornerstone.  And to give inflation control, one needed to simply extend hashcash with the use of an adjusting difficulty that provided for regular supply distribution intervals.
From the outside looking in, it might not be obvious that Bitcoin was built around the use of hashcash.  But once you realize that Bitcoin designed with the specific goal of not requiring a central authority and that, as Todd put it, hashcash is the only thing that does this, it becomes clear that all of the backwards ways that Bitcoin does things are done that way specifically to make a currency system that can rely on hashcash.  And reading those 2001 discussions shows that Bitcoin was created upon the notion that a payment system built around hashcash could solve the centralization problem.

Regardless of the reason, anybody arguing that miners should be the stewards of the network has a lot of explaining to do when miners already work against the network when "trusted" with something as simple transaction selection.

A hard fork is practically impossible now for a couple of reasons.  (1)  Hard forks will always be contentious, because there are too many people (like myself) that value the contention.  We recognize that the contention is the security of Bitcoin's immutability.  (2)  The market values the security of Bitcoin's immutability provided by people who will always contend a hard fork.  Accordingly, any serious threat to hard fork will result in a market decline that will deter miners from proceeding (they like high rewards).

Hard forks are a thing of the past.  Soft forks may be too.  We shall see.  All of this what could have been nonsense is meaningless.  The reality is that Bitcoin is almost solidified.  You guys can go ahead and write it's 1000th obituary.  But I revel in the accomplishment.  If something as good as SegWit gets blocked, the market is going respond to the signal by treating Bitcoin as the true safe haven it has promised to be.

Bitcoin is hashcash as a currrency.  That's what Todd, Back, and Finney were working on back in 2001.  Someone finally did it with Bitcoin.  The creators chose to remain pseudonymous, so we must speculate on who they are.
However, I find it interesting that the hashcash white paper and Bitcoin's white paper are in the exact same format.  But we know that Back probably didn't code things, so Bitcoin's first iteration probably required the help of someone else (perhaps Craig Wright /s).

If value was not first stored, how could it be used to exchange value?
The opposite is true.  Nothing can be used as a medium of exchange if it is not first valuable.  And for any asset which only has utility as a money (i.e. paper, shells, or arrowheads), it must first represent stored value there (even if by opportunity labor cost) before it is capable of exchanging value.
You couldn't purchase that first pizza with Bitcoin if people weren't first using Bitcoin as a store of wealth.

I am not disillusioned about what an on-chain transaction is.  One block can easily take more than an hour to find.  And to be safe, you should wait for several confirmations.  No block size is going to make on-chain transactions fast enough  for mainstream usage as a payment system.

Yes it can directly cause a permanent network split.  Just as directly as stabbing someone in an artery can directly cause death.  But for either, the foreseeable result (permanent split or death) would not have occurred.  That's direct.  Indirect goes back to proximation.  Are you going to lie about true assessments of degree in order to muddy the lines between direct and indirect?  I mean we are talking about something that occurs very quickly after a chain split (that could result in an orphan).  Very shortly after the soft fork is tested (with an old chain block), the permanent split occurs.


Nope.  That's what you are trying to do by playing a semantics game with the distinction between hard forks and soft forks.  You are doing this to claim that soft forks pose no risk--this is your ultimate deception.  But when someone shows a negative result from a soft fork, you say no, the soft fork wasn't the cause, it was the hard fork. (i.e.  "The stabbing didn't cause death, the bleeding did.").  This probably works on most people (and seems to have worked on you), but that's only because they didn't spend time in law school learning esoteric nuances of causation.  To most, causation can confuse.  But to anyone who has spent time in law school, it's easy to discern and articulate why you are wrong (as I have done with you), and the explanation is also easy for others to understand when it wasn't readily apparent beforehand.
So here's the ultimate truth that YOU are trying to distract from:  soft forks pose a risk and markets generally respond to risk by lowering value.


Good call.  Your problem began with this one error: you bought your own bullshit--you tricked yourself.  While soft forks are less risky than hard forks, they can result in the same harm.  All of the energy you are expending is really just an attempt to avoid acknowledging your error.  Accordingly, you're larger error is pride.  But the more energy you invest in salvaging your pride, the more painful it is to swallow it.  You're way behind, but like a good gambler, you are better off eating your losses and learning from your mistakes.  Ultimately, it's better for you to actually be correct and feel butthurt than to feel correct and be wrong.
Soft forks pose a risk.  And immutability lovers don't like that risk.

Where the hell do you come up with this nonsense?  Miners get paid to dig a hole and refill it ad infinitum.  They are the Sisyphus of Bitcoin. ^1 All of their work is meaningless except for one purpose: to have a method for nodes to agree which transactions will be considered the valid transactions.  We structure the reward to the winning miners in such a way that their individual interests are served by regarding only the shortest of terms (usually until the next block).  That's the reason Wu has refused to quit mining empty blocks (short-term interest).  These are the last people who should be considered stewards.  The longest term interest they could ever be aligned with is until payout of their mining rigs that are always quickly heading to obsolescence.  And many of them exacerbate their conflict with debt.
Presently, the largest miners would be best served by pushing off small nodes and monopolizing/oligopolizing the system to the exclusion of their would-be competitors.  Any who could do this would be better off with a harmed (centralized) Bitcoin they control than a decentralized Bitcoin that could replace them (either by competition or by algorithm change).
Miners are not stewards.  To think so is stupid.  They have mercenary mindsets.  And we've intentionally incentivized them in that way to assure maximum security of the Blockchain by rewarding only the most fierce competition for the next block (only the winner gets a cookie.  Everyone else leaves empty-handed).
1.  In Greek mythology Sisyphus was the king of Ephyra (now known as Corinth). He was punished for his self-aggrandizing craftiness and deceitfulness by being forced to roll an immense boulder up a hill, only to watch it come back to hit him, repeating this action for eternity. 
Self-aggrandizing - considering themselves "stewards of the network."
craftiness - empty blocks, selfish mining, relay networks, etc.
deceitfulness - arguing under sockpuppets that bigger blocks will lead to decentralization.

There's a lot of value in having a truly immutable protocol.  And if something as good as SegWit doesn't pass, then there is little risk of anything bad passing.  The thing about consensus is that it is increasingly difficult to achieve as a group gets larger.  Bitcoin's "evolution" (at Layer 1) might best be served by causing it to no longer "evolve."
If SegWit passes, then good.  If it does not, Fine.

Read everything he advocates through a prism:  consider from the contention perspective of whether it will lead to miner control or not.  Literally every call to action that he advocates will lead to miner control.  He even advocates that miners should be the trusted stewards of the network.

Perhaps they enjoy the fact that 5% of their revenues are from fees and realize that implementing SegWit will remove those.  The transaction space supply is perfectly inelastic.  Accordingly, when supply can't  meet demand, the price adjustment is abrupt and dramatic.  Segwit will add more supply than there is demand.  Accordingly, fees will default back to where they were before blocks were full.  And the added transactions won't come close to making up the difference.

They push for their agenda and you refuse that.  Bitcoin is solidifying and you can't fight it without quickening it.  You need to embrace that like those of us who truly love immutability.  Because fighting for SegWit can't help you.  It makes Bitcoin even more contentious.  Take a cue from who seems fine if SegWit doesn't pass.

It does.  Once widely implemented (which will never happen), it gives miners ability to increase the blocksize without a risk of mining worthless rewards.  In other words, it trusts the miners with the block sizes.  If they incrementally grow the block size, they can do this while the nodes of ordinary users slowly fall off, then only nodes operated by large resource users (like large miners) are the only ones maintaining the network.  The ordinary users no longer have a say, as they can't even run nodes.  At this point the network is completely under miner control (and governable).  This is the result of trusting miners.  BU is the worst idea I've ever heard of.
@_date: 2016-12-13 00:37:52


Holy shit.  Yes you are--on multiple levels.  I'll work backwards.


Litecoin doesn't use SHA256 for POW.  It uses script.  Miners are incompatible.


No.  That's not how it would have to work.  First, (b) should say "enforce" instead of activate.  Now, to understanding:
At the point of enforcement, because new nodes are compliant with old node rules, there is no chance to fork until the old mining nodes produce a block that is non-compliant with the new nodes enforcing new rules.  The new nodes reflect the block and soon thereafter find their own block.  At that point the fork has occurred.  The question is whether it will amount to a lasting fork or result in the old nodes orphaning the block.  The answer to that question depends on how much hash power is available on the new chain.  And this is where the economics comes into play, because if the rewards on the new node chain have much lass value than on the original node chain, then miners quickly start switching back, leaving the new chain incapable of orphaning the original node chain.
Let's say, for instance, that 51 % of miners decided to attempt to force the network to follow its soft fork, thinking, as you did, that the network has no choice but to follow.  And let's say that most of the exchanges polled their customers and realized that they would be best off not supporting the new chain and keeping their user-interfacing nodes running the original chain consensus rules.  Then those exchanges don't offer trading of the new chain, giving it no opportunity to attain a high market value.  The result would be that  new chain miners are mining worthless rewards and most would quickly return to where they are paid for efforts.  If it helps you to think of this as hard-forking back (even though the new chain was never economically viable), then great.
Now that's a perfectly realistic scenario if the miners truly (but incorrectly) believe as you do that they are the only ones that "matter" and they are able to soft fork with a simple majority/low threshold.
Now what would really happen if miners thought they were going to try this or any other fork that a large portion of the market didn't approve is that the market would punish them by taking a big dive.  And this effectively deters such efforts before they begin.  We've already seen the response a couple of times when there seemed a credible threat to hard fork.  So when you say miners are the only ones that matter, that is not true in practice, because large holders seem to wield major influence over miners.
We need to get to the point where the market deters all threats to change consensus rules (soft or hard). And because big money values the security of immutability we will soon be there (if not already).  And securing immutability will further attract new big money (these people don't like the idea of people meddling with the rules).

These solutions might be fine.  But where is the urgency to implement?  Urgency is what was used to cause swift action.

Are you arguing that this is not clumsy compared to a potential second-layer, trustless, decentralized, low-fee, zero-confirmation implementation that supports billions of transactions per day?
You say


But the simple method of raising the cap produces a less than ideal scaling solution.  There are still 10 +- minute confirmations.  That means that those coffees you waited ten minute for must all be stored on the block chain.  This consumes resources which will cause, inarguably, at least some users not to contribute nodes who otherwise would--I argue that it will be lots of users if XT is implemented.
So while you could scale Bitcoin in this simple minded way, is it the best way?  By your standards, obviously not, as you say


If simply raising the block cap is not ideal, why would we do it now?  It's not an urgent matter (the stress tests confirm that).  It's certainly not urgent to hard code 7.6 GB.
The only other reason to implement XT now, is that people don't understand that raising the cap too high (e.g. 7.6 GB) could preempt the LN from coming to fruition.  If this weren't true, then maybe there is no urgent reason not to implement BIP 101.  But this is true.  Below is how:
What rewards will induce the hash power to secure the network when block rewards are gone? The answer is only fees. There are two competing ways fees can do it. Either lots of small fees through lots of transactions (which will consume huge amounts of resources and cause the centralization of Bitcoin) or through fewer BC transactions with larger fees, which protects decentralization. However, if there are few transactions with low fees, miners leave. If lightning were to develop without a fee market in place, transactions would move off chain and miners would receive no reward and Bitcoin would be vulnerable. This is the long-term scenario that happens under an implementation of both XT and Lightning. Thus, if the cap is increased too greatly LN will not be able to be implemented. Why would we hinder LN, the potentially more elegant solution, when implementing a clumsy solution is not urgent? It makes no sense.
There may come a time when raising the cap is more urgent, and it will have to be done, but now is not that time.  So why hard code 7.6 GB now?  That's recklessness.

While you say that sticking with 1MB is a bad choice, what is the urgency to increase the cap?  I am asking this as a serious question (I was running XT until I realized I could not answer this question).
Prior to the "stress tests" I imagined bigger problems once the limit was reached, but the problems did not seem so serious that a small cap increase could not be implemented when real demand reached the limit.  Apart from a potential delay in an increase when it is needed (resulting in higher fees through proper wallet implementation), is there some urgent need to increase the cap?  What am I missing?

I can't tell if you understand this point or not, but presently implementing XT preempts a future implementation of LN:
What rewards will induce the hash power to secure the network when block rewards are gone?  The answer is only fees.  There are two competing ways fees can do it.  Either lots of small fees through lots of transactions (which will consume huge amounts of resources and cause the centralization of Bitcoin) or through fewer BC transactions with larger fees, which protects decentralization.  However, if there are few transactions with low fees, miners leave.  If lightning were to develop without a fee market in place, Bitcoin would be vulnerable.  This is the scenario that happens under an implementation of both XT and Lightning.  Thus, if XT is implemented LN will not be able to be implemented.  Why would we hinder LN, the more elegant solution, when cap increase is not urgent?  It makes no sense.  XT is not a backup; it excludes the better solution. This urgency to implement XT is manufactured.
@_date: 2015-08-18 20:54:28
I generally agree with you.  Thankfully we do not have to choose right now.  When the matter becomes urgent, getting a 2-4 MB increase should not be difficult.  However, hard coding 8GB right now, in the face of hindering/preventing LN (a first-class scaling solution), just seems uselessly reckless.
@_date: 2015-08-20 16:55:46
That creates an urgency for dynamic fee wallet implementations.  By the way, the guy over at Coinwallet.eu who keeps spamming the network says his users are unaffected because they already implement dynamic fees (what a useful asshole).
But even if you want no users to have an increased fee in the meantime, a 2-4MB cap should alleviate your concerns.  There is no urgency to hard code 7.6 (or 8) GB.  
I don't think there is even urgency for any increase.  You do realize that many transactions are made with no need to be confirmed in the next block.  Dynamic fee implementations could estimate to allow users to pay more for faster confirmations and less for those that could confirm anytime of the day?  How much of the current real traffic needs next block confirmation?  My point is that the urgency was manufactured and the stress tests prove that.  We can hold off before jumping aboard any increase, much less XT.
Manufactured urgency prior to stress tests:
It's not urgent.
@_date: 2015-08-17 18:24:58
A problem with that solution is that it leads to less decentralization within Bitcoin.  I'm okay with raising the cap if it becomes urgent, but the "stress tests" have shown no urgency to do so.  And the solution you described works if the cap is not increased.


More hash power protects form 51% attack.  And while fees induce hash power, it's not the number of fees, but the total amount of fees.  This can be accomplished through either a few higher fees (with the majority of low fee transaction on LN with zero confirmation) or with lots of low fee transactions (which consume resources still requires 10-min confirmation).  The latter leaded to less decentralization.  Both protect against a 51% attack.  Again, making a change is not urgent, why not wait for the better until there is urgency.
@_date: 2015-08-23 16:59:52
Bitcoin is presently not a good payment system (10 min +- confirmations).  It's fine for remittances/settlement, not great for purchasing coffee (instant face to face transactions).  Scaling it by simply raising the cap is even more clumsy.  There is no urgency to increase the cap, much less hard code 7.6 GB.  So why not wait and let the non-developed solution (that didn't exist as a known idea until February) develop?  Why hard code 7.6 GB?  It's reckless nonsense.
@_date: 2015-08-20 23:40:18


This is the point most seem not to understand and the point I was missing before I turned off my XT 11.A node.  It's not orthogonal.
What rewards will induce the hash power to secure the network when block rewards are gone?  The answer is only fees.  There are two competing ways fees can reward miners.  Either lots of small fees through lots of transactions (which will consume huge amounts of resources and cause the centralization of Bitcoin) or through fewer BC transactions with larger fees, which protects decentralization.  However, if there are few transactions with low fees, miners leave.  If lightning were to develop without a fee market in place, Bitcoin would be vulnerable.  This is the long-term scenario that happens under an implementation of both XT and Lightning.  Thus, if the cap is increased too greatly LN will not be able to be implemented.  Why would we hinder LN, the more elegant solution, when cap increase is not urgent?  It makes no sense.
@_date: 2015-08-14 15:05:40
If a working off-chain solution were implemented that would aggregate many small off-chain transactions (along with small fees) into one large on-chain transaction with a high fee, I might be inclined to agree with crazy Luke.  However, that solution does not yet exist in working form.  Until it does, what is the urgency to change the cap at all (if Bitcoin is not falling apart from overcrowded usage)?

Above you said that if new core became the main chain but old core was still ran, the old core would be the altcoin.  But this isn't consensus according to your consensus post (which was quite enlightening, I mean that).  Consensus would result in no altcoin, but a hard fork according to your posted diagram.  So the only time there is an altcoin is when there is an economic majority, but no consensus.  Absent consensus the altcoin is the chain not in the economic majority.  So for you to proclaim XT an altcoin, you must think that it is more likely than not that XT, upon garnering 750/1000 blocks after January 11, will still not garner economic majority??  It seems to me that if this happens Core will lose economic majority, so more appropriate to refer to Core as the altcoin.  After all, you say


To be intellectually honest, Core is the altcoin, or at least the more likely altcoin, because XT can't become altcoin until the chain forks, and only under the unlikely scenario of not gaining economic majority after going 75% of hash rate.
I arrive at this with your rules.  If you insist on calling something an altcoin before it is, by your definition, shouldn't it be the one you think is most likely to actually become the altcoin?
It's weird to me that you can call Core an altcoin.

Suppose that in one year a second layer solution was introduced that would allow thousands of transactions a second to be confirmed   practically instantaneously and then later aggregate those into one blockchain transaction (as a settlement).  Wouldn't that solution solve your problem and also the restaurant's problem of a possible double-spend?  Wouldn't that solution also allow me to continue to run a node?
If the urgency is to make it so that within the next year people can purchase restaurant food during a "stress test," that's not urgent enough.  At least not urgent enough to make it so that average people eventually might not be able to run nodes.

Maybe we should bury our heads and ignore all other solutions and push forward implementing a plan that forces us to upgrade our capacity every two years no matter what?  I mean if we are at 50% capacity, that's pretty damn safe, especially considering what happens when we reach max capacity (pretty much nothing detrimental in the short run).   Why would we commit ourselves irrevocably to all of our increases for the next 25 years when we could fix this non-urgent problem with a cap raise to 2M which would get us to say 25% capacity?  It makes no sense.  There is no urgency.  Bitcoin doesn't break when we reach capacity, in fact, we've seen the price go up.  If it stays at capacity, then increase the capacity.  None of this is urgent.  Certainly not implementing code that will raise us to 8G.

That’s a myopic and shallow understanding either by you, the people you argue with, or both.
Bitcoin must be a secure store of value before it can be truly adopted for any other uses.  Over the last two years, this community has fought and won a battle to prevent the deterioration Bitcoin’s utility as an ungovernable store of value by those willing to do so in trade for negligible so-called scalability.  All the while, we have known that scalable low-fee transactions are coming via second-layer technologies.  These, however, take time to develop.
But even during this time, Bitcoin has never been *just* as store of value.  People purchase shit all of the time with Bitcoin.  But it is true that Bitcoin’s present fees make smaller purchases uneconomical.
This will change with layer-2 tech.  But is the world really in dire need of fast payments?  Don’t we have that already?  And do we really care if they are trustless and ungovernable?  If we do, then great, they are coming.  But I don’t think they are nearly as important as the ungovernable world-wide fixed-supply money/store of value that Bitcoin is currently being adopted as.  And we for damn sure are not trading that usage for cheap transactions for small purchases.  Especially not when both are attainable.

This just doesn't make sense.  Why would people have to have fast and cheap on the first layer if they can have it on the second layer?  The only reasons for building the second layer is so that people can have fast and cheap transactions while still maintaining a low resource decentralized currency by not bloating the first layer.

Is 8G urgent?
@_date: 2015-08-20 19:34:45
Users are arbitrarily forced to pay more for Bitcoin because of the 21 million cap.  But this cap serves only an economic purpose.
The block cap serves both a technical function and an economic function.  Technically it prevents DOS and decentralization.  Raising it  gives less protection against both of these.  Hard coding 8G is death to decentralization.  It's beyond "risky."  And it's needless.
Economically, the cap assures scarcity of BC transactions, which guarantees miner rewards, which protects the network.  It creates the same type scarcity that the artificial 21 million BTC cap creates.  There is no ideological problem with either of these.  Jon anatomist, by the way, thinks we will eventually have to raise the 21 million Bitcoin limit to secure Bitcoin.
Until LN was a possibility, scaling Bitcoin was going to come with a trade off to security and decentralization.  Now it may not.  There is no urgency, why not stick with status quo?  XT is a clunky solution with high costs that need not be implemented at the moment.  
@_date: 2015-08-03 03:11:56

You are not well informed on this, which is understandable given that this is being sold as 8M.  XT doubles the cap limit until it reaches 8G.
Furthermore, LN could allow for low fee transactions while settlement transactions on the BC are higher, thus maintaining your view of Bitcoin while still preserving decentralization, which will inevitably be reduced under XT.  We all know what that leads to.
Please spend some time reading my other posts/pleadings.  They make a lot of sense.
@_date: 2015-08-14 16:37:13
It's hard to imagine it going on for weeks.  The problem would have become urgent by then and we would have implemented a cap increase, as is being pushed now without the urgency.  However, we probably would not implement a cap increase that keeps increasing to 8GB.

This is the point most people don't get (which certainly includes you who did not realize that 8GB is hard coded into XT).
What rewards will induce the hash power to secure the network when block rewards are gone?  The answer is only fees.  There are two competing ways fees can do it.  Either lots of small fees through lots of transactions (which will consume huge amounts of resources and cause the centralization of Bitcoin) or through fewer BC transactions with larger fees, which protects decentralization.  However, if there are few transactions with low fees, miners leave.  If lightning were to develop without a fee market in place, Bitcoin would be vulnerable.  This is the scenario that happens under an implementation of both XT and Lightning.  Why would we hinder LN, the more elegant solution, when cap increase is not urgent?  It makes no sense.
@_date: 2015-08-20 13:05:13
What if thousands of low-fee transactions took place on the trustless decentralized 2nd layer solution, and then their fees were aggregated to settle (for $20) on the BC?  Nothing would prohibit direct high-fee settlement on the BC if it were important, but most coffee purchases would be handled off-chain for low fees with zero confirmation time.
Regardless of whether you admit this would work for you, practically everyone else would love it.
Increasing the cap preempts this solution.

Because the fix can be implemented quickly and already exists.  Simply raise the cap.  However, raising the cap is not yet urgent.

How do you arrive at this?  From the language in the BIP, I see nothing to suggest that 80% would be needed for a decrease or increase.  It appears to me that the middle 60% of votes will be used (attempting to discarding potential deviant votes) to perform a statistical analysis and calculation to find the "most common floor," whatever that is defined to be, and then use that as the new block size cap whether higher or lower.

Why not wait until real demand actually causes real need (assuming LN isn't developed by then), and then implement a one-time code increase.  What is the urgency?
@_date: 2015-08-20 14:29:49

While it's unclear what exactly he is suggesting, I don't think that he means taking the 20% quantile.  If so, he would have said drop the 20% and take the floor.  But he said take the **most common** floor.  This implies some sort of calculation between the remaining 60% of votes, but I don't know what that means.  However, I gave a suggestion for what that could mean above.
@_date: 2015-08-18 19:40:17
The "danger" has been exaggerated.  On May 4 we were told this is urgent, but since then the "stress tests" have shown otherwise.  If this were urgent I'd be singing a different tune.  But it's not urgent.  If raising the cap would not hinder LN, I'd be pro present cap increase.  But it will hinder.  If it's not urgent, why not wait for the more elegant solution?  At that point everyone (close enough) will be for at least a one-time cap increase.
@_date: 2015-08-23 01:28:35
It's clumsy because it leaves you still with 10+- confirmation times, blockchain bloat, much greater resources consumption, and therefore less decentralization.  It's still not a solution to make Bitcoin into a competitive payment network.  Moreover, implementing XT preempts much more elegant solutions (that promise far more transactions with zero confirmations) that may or may not prove to be workable--this is true, if you don't understand it ask.  There is no urgency to raise the cap, much less implement XT.  
Prior to February it was practically a foregone conclusion that a cap increase was the only way to trustlessly scale Bitcoin.  After the LN white paper it has been determined that it might not be necessary to raise the cap too much.  Compared to this potential alternative a mere cap increase is like having two left hands; it's far from ideal and not the best that can possibly be done.  Even if it were urgent to increase the cap, it's certainly not urgent to hard code 7.6 GB.  It's clumsy.

With Feathercoin, what percentage agreed? Practically none.  There was no attempt to takeover litecoin.  The idea was to start an altcoin.  However, suppose Feathercoin was adopted by practically all litecoin users, would it then have just been a hard fork of Litecoin?
If not, why not?
If so, then if a small percentage of litecoin users started running the litecoin nodes and miners again, are they now the altcoin?
If XT garners a 95% agreement, is it a hard fork, or must it have 100% to not be an altcoin.  If it must have 100%, then in what time frame?  What time frames were previous Bitcoin hard forks completed in.  Was there ever a time when Bitcoin was actually an altcoin because the hard fork had not yet been completed (e.g. In Spring of 2013 when a hard fork was needed to repair Hearn's fuck up, was that temporarily an altcoin before becoming a hard fork?)?  Is it possible that XT becomes a hard fork, then Core becomes the altcoin.
Do you see what I'm getting at?  Altcoin, in spite of your attempt to make it black and white, is a term of degree (not the type thing programmers tend to have an affinity for).  While you are trying desperately to give it a technical definition, it's really a term of general intent (I.e. Is this intended to be different?).  The reason it's so important for you to do so is because you think it's a persuasive argument, but it's not.  Everyone just thinks that if XT gets a large enough percentage of adoption then technically it's no different from a hard fork, because again, it's a term of degree.
You should back off of this argument and make more persuasive arguments--there are plenty.  This one pushes people to XT, because it's annoying.

While it might be better to never experience the problems of high capacity, there is no urgency.  A fix can be implemented quickly when the problem actually is urgent.  Why should I implement it now when by implementing it I'm committing to remove myself from node-running in a few years.  I would commit to a one-time increase if it were urgent, but it's not.  It seems likely that it won't even be "urgent" within the next year.

This fee issue is why LN needs somewhat small blocks.  A fee market will need to exist so that Blockchain fees can increase to reward miners.
The scenario will go something like this:  There could be lots of transactions on the LN with small fees that could be aggregated for settlement on the BC.  Users of the LN will pay low fees, but miners will be rewarded with a high fee, even as the block reward dwindles.
This will assure long term decentralized security of the network while also providing an elegant scaling solution with zero confirmation transactions for coffee purchases.
There is no urgent need to prevent this solutions from developing.
@_date: 2015-08-14 18:35:42
I'm obviously posing a question for discussio.  I am taking the position that it is not urgent.  My agenda is two-fold: 1) to figure out if I'm missing something, and 2) to persuade others to my thinking if I can't be shown wrong.  That agenda is not hidden, nor should it be, so what agenda do you think I am hiding?
I have always been for Gavin.  I mean shit! I've been running XT even before the code implementation to show my support.  You can see it in my history.  But it hit me last night that this is not urgent.  It was that "urgency" (Oh no the blocks are almost full and Bitcoin will break) that sold me to support of swift change, and even to support exponential growth in the cap size.  However, we've now seen that Bitcoin doesn't go to shit just because the blocks are full and that there is time to fix the problem.
I'm happy if someone can show me I'm wrong, but so far nothing even close to abandonment has happened.  He called for urgency because users would abandon, but I don't see it.  In fact, price has risen since the "stress tests."  Where is the urgency?
@_date: 2015-08-18 19:47:45


What rewards will induce the hash power to secure the network when block rewards are gone?  The answer is only fees.  There are two competing ways fees can do it.  Either lots of small fees through lots of transactions (which will consume huge amounts of resources and cause the centralization of Bitcoin) or through fewer BC transactions with larger fees, which protects decentralization.  However, if there are few transactions with low fees, miners leave.  If lightning were to develop without a fee market in place, Bitcoin would be vulnerable.  This is the scenario that happens under an implementation of both XT and Lightning.




Now that you see from above how the two are mutually exclusive without harming the network, where is the urgency to increase the cap?  Gavin proclaimed it urgent on May 4, but "stress tests" have shown otherwise.  Why not wait until it is urgent rather than hard coding 8G now?

This is one way Bitcoin will catch on with consumers.  Some merchants receive huge advantages for having an online "cash" option.  Those merchants will be able to offer steep discounts, which will entice consumers to use Bitcoin.  We will be seeing more of this. (My guess is that lawyers.com has lots of chargebacks).
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:06:39


This is not true.  All that happens (under proper wallet implementations) when real demand gets high is that fees temporarily get high if you want quick confirmation.  If the fees get so high that they start to affect usage, which is noticeable by price drop, then the cap could easily be raised to 2MB with little lobbying.  The only reason this takes so much lobbying is because it's a bad idea.
 I'll agree that if increasing cap were the only scaling possibility then it would be better to do so now, rather than wait until necessary.  However, because of the introduction of LN, there is now a far more elegant scaling solution.  Under LN, the security of the Bitcoin network will be weak if the cap is high.  Accordingly raising the cap preempt a LN from coming to fruition.  At the same time, increasing the cap decreases decentralization (Bitcoin could already be controlled through just three mining pools).  Why the hell is there a manufactured urgency to do this when the "stress tests" show no true urgency?

Ironically, this could just show how there is no urgency to resolve this issue.  Wallet providers need only to implement "dynamic fees" and, as author said, all users are immune from this attack, except that they have to pay a still-small fee.  This "attack" illustrates an urgency to upgrade wallets, but no urgency to implement XT.
@_date: 2015-08-19 02:57:38


This is the point most people don't get.
What rewards will induce the hash power to secure the network when block rewards are gone?  The answer is only fees.  There are two competing ways fees can do it.

However, if there are few transactions with low fees, miners leave.  If lightning were to develop without a fee market in place, Bitcoin would be vulnerable.  This is the scenario that happens under an implementation of both XT and Lightning.  Why would we hinder LN, the more elegant solution, when cap increase is not urgent?  It makes no sense.


If XT is implemented you'll be able to do this.  However, in time you and I will not be able to host a node as the resource requirement will be too great.  Bitcoin will be left to a few bigger entities and we both know that at that point even bigger entities will then control Bitcoin.  It will not remain decentralized.  If the cap remains the same (or low) and LN comes to fruition Bitcoin can scale more elegantly and still remained decentralized.  The important transactions will still be on the BC, but with a higher fee.  But at least Bitcoin remains free from meddling.

I get the point, and I also understand that it may be a popular belief around these parts.  But it is not true that people generally commit felonies without knowing it.  In fact, the vast majority of felonies require a *mens rea* element, making it such that one cannot commit a felony without knowing it.  Strict liability crimes are very rarely felonies, and generally only considered violations that carry a small penalty.

These forks provide a very interesting case for studying the human psyche when it comes to value.  If Bitcoin Gold started with a new genesis block, there is no way that the people who held BTG at the fork would have spent the immediate market value of their forked BTG holdings to acquire genesis BTG.  Oddly, however, if people are already holding it, they tend to be reluctant to sell.  So new forks create immediate market value due to this reluctance to sell.
Who would have paid $300 for each BTG they hold if it had not been given to them?  Practically nobody.  But not selling is the financial equivalent (taxes not considered).  Yet it is clear that most people do not sell (probably because it is emotionally different).
As more and more people realize this, there will be more sellers driving down market values.  In the meantime, there’s lots of money to be made in forking new coins.
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:58:30
When we get closer to that situation, the problem becomes more "urgent."  However, the LN could alleviate this potential problem before it has time to materialize.  While it's not urgent why not wait as a far better solution develops that doesn't reduce centralization?
It is not as if we don't have a solution to the problem you've described.  And it's not as if the problem you described will destroy Bitcoin.  All that happens is fees go up until the cap increases.  Admittedly, if there were not better alternatives in development, it would be better to preempt the problem.  But since there are better solutions in development--that require smaller blocks for adequacy--why not wait until the problem does require attention, recognizing that the problem may never get to that point because a better solution has been developed?
@_date: 2015-08-23 19:46:47
I'm not looking to argue the merits of a development that hasn't taken place.  What I will argue is that in time it may prove and presently promises to be better.  With that being the case, the only reason to make a move to preempt such a development is if there is some urgent need to do so.  But the stress tests show no urgent need for a cap increase and certainly no urgency for hard coding 7.6 GB.  Presently implementing XT/BIP 101 is both unwise and unnecessary.  This urgency has been manufactured.

They have no power without miners using their pool, which will of course go away at an attempt to remove or change the cap.  Also, if the cap were removed the market value of a bitcoin would likewise go away.  Not gonna happen.

@_date: 2015-08-20 19:53:05


Not exactly.  The BC fees can remain low while LN is developed and adopted.  However, when block rewards drop to the point where mining is only profitable on transaction fees, then if LN handles most everyday transactions at low fees, then BC transactions will need to have a higher fee (which could be paid by aggregating LN fees).  The other solution is to keep all transactions on BC, killing decentralization.  If the LN doesn't come to fruition before BC fees become a deterrent for usage, then the cap can be raised to relieve the pressure.  That's when the matter is truly urgent, and the urgency will garner concensus easily.

You interpret as follows:


However, the BIP reads:


I think you have probably misinterpreted, but I can't come up with a definite explanation for what is meant.
Under your scenario, you interpret as if the minimum after dropping 20% is the cap.  But then why drop the top 20%, which would be arbitrarily useless?  Normally when dropping the outliers in statistics it is for more mainstream calculations of adjusted means.  I would assume that some variation of this is what is intended, but then that begs another question:  
What is the meaning of "most common floor (minimum)"?
It seems you have interpreted (minimum) to be the definition of "most common floor," but (minimum) could just be an i.e. of only the word "floor," meaning the phrase could be read "most common minimum."  This is what I think was most likely meant, but that again begs another question:
What the hell is a "most common minimum"?
I have no idea, but **I could imagine that a statistical analysis could then be placed on the middle 60% of votes and then maybe whatever number is 1-2 standard deviations beneath the mean could be the "most common minimum."**
Another confusing issue about this is that while we are choosing the most common minimum, it is for the **maximum** block size.
Of course, all of this is simply speculation over a vague and ambiguous writing.  I am just trying to interpret a reasonable meaning that does not result in absurdity.  My suggested interpretation would result in a reasonable proposal not subject to such an *obvious* weakness.  But again, I have no idea what is meant by "most common floor (minimum)."  Furthermore, I also don't know if there is other information that confirms your interpretation--I hope not.  Just trying to make sense of it.

I tend to agree.  For my first year and a half of owning Bitcoin I did not tell anyone; I didn't want to be thought of as a drug user.  Then perception changed somewhat, and I would slowly let the cat out of the bag with the right people--people who have enough respect for my intelligence that they will question their own before they write me off.
Just they other day I met with a former business partner.  He is one of the smartest economic minds I've ever ran across.  He did not know much about Bitcoin, and I told him the basics of the economics and dispelled a few wrong notions, and he immediately gets it.  It's all about framing the conversation.  
First, I don't waste my time with lemmings.  I only want to explain to smart open-minded people.
Second, of those people, I will only explain to those who have a mutual respect for me (credentials help).  For the less inclined, they will be persuaded by use cases (saving money, sending money, etc.)
Third, I never speak of Bitcoin as being a part of a "community."  I only speak of its fundamentals.
Fourth, I do not sell.  I share, like showing someone a funny video on YouTube, I share with a little enthusiasm that I expect to be addictive.  None of this is forced.  I truly do share only for the mutual pleasure of sharing.
Of the people I've told (less than 20), they have all been receptive on at least an interest level.  Most now follow the price and happenings, and some have even become holders.
I don't proselytize and would only share with the right people, but when done properly those people are receptive.  People can get it, they just don't want something pushed on them.

What rewards will induce the hash power to secure the network when block rewards are gone?  The answer is only fees.  There are two competing ways fees can do it.  Either lots of small fees through lots of transactions (which will consume huge amounts of resources and cause the centralization of Bitcoin) or through fewer BC transactions with larger fees, which protects decentralization.  However, if there are few transactions with low fees, miners leave.  If lightning were to develop without a fee market in place, Bitcoin would be vulnerable.  This is the scenario that happens under an implementation of both XT and Lightning
On the other hand, if the cap does not get increased and lightning develops, then Bitcoin will start to scale in usage off chain and settlements can be made on the BC.  Many zero-conf instantaneous low-fee transactions can be aggregated into one higher fee settlement on the BC.  This is a far more elegant scaling solution than simply hard coding a cap increase and furthermore it protects decentralization.  But... Increasing the cap (especially hard coding 8 Gigabytes) will hinder this.  Because there is no urgency to raise the cap, why not give time for the better solution to develop?
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:33:27


Of course not.  It’s first a store of value, but not *just*.  Now that it has established its superiority as a store of value, Bitcoin will continue to grow in adoption as such.  And as this happens we will see technological developments that will bring Bitcoin’s concomitant adoption as a medium of exchange.  Then, and ultimately, a unit of account.

Those tx fees may still be going to the miners (or at least a portion of them).  The mining fees may go way high, but the caveat could be that one blockchain transaction with a large fee could represent the settlement of thousands of LN transactions with small fees.
Are the offchain solutions less secure?  Also, there is nothing from stopping me from making a blockchain transaction if it is important to me.  Say I need to move several thousand dollars... I wouldn't mind paying a large mining fee to keep it on the chain--although I'd rather pay nothing.  However, if the cost of low fees is a Bitcoin that can't be ran by the average person, I would rather have the other solution.  Otherwise this whole decentralized idea was likely pretext.

You did not even read what I wrote.  LN would easily derive its own value, but how would the BC derive its value in the face of instant transactions?  If LN develops well transactions will move off chain.  How will miners be rewarded once the block reward drops if there are few transactions on the BC due to LN?  It's the BC that needs the value derived from scarcity, not the LN.  If the BC is not scarce then fees remain low and miners quit mining, therefore the network is insecure.  If LN gets developed this is the fate you are setting For Bitcoin if the cap is raised too high.

Almost everything I have ever voted on has been based on an idea.  Even presidential candidates are voted on based on untested ideas.  Votes are usually most necessary to decide between ideas with uncertain outcomes and implementations.  No BIP has been coded and tested in the live market with real transactions; 101 hasn't even become effective, so who knows what the hell will happen when it does.
None of these "votes" are anything but a show of support for a favorite idea.  However, the only thing that really changes the protocol is the code that is implemented.  Presently, of the BIPs there is only one with an implementation (yet not effective), and less than 1% of mining votes support it.  So yes, they are voting on an idea, the appropriate thing to do.

Thoughts I've had for a while when I consider the nations holding U.S. Debt (interesting for discussion, but even I take them with a grain of salt):
So if China holds a lot of Treasury bonds (approx. $1.3 trillion worth), they have a lot of economic power over the U.S. in that they have power to devalue the dollar.  However, if Bitcoin became the world reserve currency, the dollar would begin to become worthless, not just through increased supply, but through decreased demand.  In this way Bitcoin is a threat to the dollar, but it is not necessarily a threat to Americans if Americans adopt Bitcoin first or at least at the same time as the rest of the world.  In that instance, Americans would no longer give a shit how many dollars are printed, as they no longer use them as their primary store of value.  Accordingly, instead of China holding a bag of economic weapons, they just end up being a bag holder when The Fed pays them back their worthless shitty dollars.
Realizing this makes one realize how Bitcoin is actually the friend of the U.S. Government assuming the current scheme can't last forever (obviously it can't).  While Bitcoin doesn't allow government to print money--a privilege greatly enjoyed and abused--natural occurrences also will ultimately preempt governments from printing value forever (eventually that system fails, and fails badly).
Enter Bitcoin:  Bitcoin offers a way to gracefully bow out of the current system while leaving others holding the bag.  Maybe the powers that be realize this and are actively promoting Bitcoin or at least not attempting to stop it???  I wonder.
Fiat money was a clever scheme.  They had a good run.  But it's clearly unsustainable.  Maybe Bitcoin, whether created by government powers or not, is now recognized as a possible solution to the mess they've created.  
I doubt it.  More than likely it's just an ingenious private creation that has the staying power to knock out the current system.

Why make a move that rules out the only other possible solution, which happens to show promise to scale Bitcoin usage far more elegantly?  There is no urgency.  The urgency is manufactured.

Then why call it the "most common floor," rather than "floor"?  You are constructing the language to absurdity.  What does "most common" mean?  I can't see how it could possibly mean just "floor."  Furthermore, if this is the case, then why drop the top 20%, which is totally unnecessary in your construction? While the language is ambiguous and vague, there are reasonable interpretations that are not absurd.
For instance, "most common floor" could be a statistical calculation where the middle 60% are placed into a bell shaped curve and the amount 1 standard deviation below the mean is defined as the "most common floor."

We have a quick solution.  Increase the block size (Not increase the blocksize over the next 25 years through speculative conjectures of numbers we will need).  However, the stress test showed that full blocks are not a problem that has to be preempted (as Gavin suggested).  When the network is under real stress, an increase can be implemented.  There is simply no urgency.  Most thought Bitcoin would just go to shit, but it didn't.  We should be proactive in prepping solutions, but not hasty to implement the easy one (with costs) over others that are possibly better, when the problem we are facing is not imminent and is not that bad.  There is no urgency.

The funny thing about Bitcoin and the "then they fight you" stage is that that stage can be undermined because anyone can buy Bitcoin and never tell anyone.  Those in the position to fight, like bank CEO's, have the ability and the incentive to acquire Bitcoin too.  They surely recognize that they could just as easily use their position to promote Bitcoin.  
Most CEOs are simply well-paid employees with a fiduciary duty to their shareholders, but they are always in a conflict of interest because sometimes their personal interests are against the companies (like when it is time to negotiate salary).  If the bank CEO realizes that Bitcoin needs to be fought, then she realizes that it is also a good buy and an even better buy if no one fights it.  The move in her best interest then is obvious--buy and promote.  There are not that many people in "power" who don't have this secret incentive.  Maybe shareholders of a central bank?

There is no urgency to hard code for 2036.  It preempts the development of a potentially far more elegant scaling solution.  It weakens decentralization.  It's clunky with still 10+- confirmation times.

Edit:  unless there are higher fees.
Do you math?  This is easy.  Raise the cap, fees stay low and Bitcoin becomes less decentralized.
Keep the cap low and fees must increase.  Accordingly, everyday type transactions get pushed over to the LN where fees are low and there is zero confirmation (near instantaneous transactions).  The LN will aggregate those fees for settlement on the high fee BC.  Bitcoin more elegantly scales while remaining decentralized.  Win-Win.
@_date: 2015-08-21 03:18:04
Don't be a drama queen.
What do you think happens when blocks are full of real traffic?  Nothing, except fee increases for transactions that need quick confirmation.  At that point you can take a minute to change a line of code.  If it takes a month to implement, no big deal.
There is no urgency to increase the limit.  And there is for damn sure no urgency to hard code 7.6 GB.

Although you say please and thanks, this still rings with a demanding tone.
There are several BIPs (100, 102, maybe 103, flex something or another-most of these are mere compromises).  But there is one solution that doesn't require a BIP: do not change the cap limit and let a second layer payment network develop.  Right now the Lightning network shows promise for allowing far more transactions per second in an instant trustless zero-confirmation way.  The problem is that raising the cap too high preempts/hinders LN from coming to fruition--this is a fact that most people don't understand; if you don't get it ask, but don't recklessly assume it's false.
@_date: 2015-08-20 13:27:02


**This so stupidly inapplicable!**
There is no urgency to increase the cap.  Of course if there were no better solutions being developed it would be better to do it now.  But LN is actively being developed and an increase in cap size will preempt its implementation.  Why preempt the far more elegant solution when there is no urgency to implement the clunky cap increase (which leads to less decentralization and still requires 10+- confirmation times)?

I see no urgency and question why Gavin decided to make it top "urgent" priority just shortly after the introduction of the lightning network.
Prior to the lightning idea, it was always a foregone conclusion that block cap would have to be increased, but it was never "urgent."  Then lightning may have changed that conclusion and all of the sudden it's "urgent."

Ministers of finance should understand money.  they should understand strengths and weaknesses of different forms of money.  And they should therefore immediately recognize when a new form of money is created that is superior to all previous forms.  This guy, like many ministers of finance, did not have the understanding of the premises that all of their conclusions about money were derived from.  He did not understand money, and particularly where it derives its value.  The proof is in his statements:
"Stores of value and means of exchange can only be regulated by human agency."
Yet, most historical stores of value have been regulated by natural occurrence (precious metals, land, heads of cattle).  The control of their supply is regulated, not by man (at least initially), but by nature.  A minister of finance should know this.

The whole appeal of science is that scientific knowledge is supported observable proof.  Without this proof, a belief becomes faith-based.  To call it not-picky to require scientific proof for something supported by science is absurd (it's also ad hominem to run from the fact that you don't have any evidence).
To call it science to believe in something on faith is just a masquerade--that's practically a religion.  It's irritating, like the creationists are irritating when they actually do deny observable proof.

When real demand grows the cap can be increased quickly.  More complicated code is already written in XT.  I see no urgency.  If it were the only possible way, then why not up the cap to prevent the crazy-ass scenario of next month Bitcoin skyrocketing in real-world usage (even at the cost ordinary users being less able to run nodes).  But raising the cap is not the only possible way.  This became true with the lightning network proposal.  Ironically, that is when Gavin declared "urgency."
There is no urgency.  We can wait and see if other solutions become available, and if demand quickly increases, a cap increase can be implemented quickly enough.
@_date: 2015-08-14 16:43:59
First.  I read his post, and you are misrepresenting what he said to make it make sense.
But to your point...
Suppose thousands of transactions could take place off-chain with small fees, and then be settled on-chain with one large fee in one transaction.  Imagine that these off-chain transactions or second-layer transactions were almost instantaneous, solving the double-spend problem without confirmation (which can take minutes to hours).  How would this not be a working solution (even better solution) that does not meet (surpass even) user expectation.
Also, if fees start to get too high (fee market) then isn't that when it becomes urgent to increase the cap?

My take on the situation exactly.
I think I value the opportunity to observe the phenomenon almost as much as I value the dividends.
But with all we’ve observed, it won’t take long before the market starts to quickly dump these to a near-zero value.  Some of the hindrances to selling (tech difficulties, etc) also make it where much fewer holders have to sell in order to drastically affect the market.  More and more people like you and I will realize that we have to sell fast in order to win the race to the bottom.

Interesting point of view.  So in this instance, present Bitcoin Core is the altcoin.  Mind Blowing.
You consistently call XT an altcoin, but if I understand you correctly, if XT becomes the economic majority, then that would make present Core the altcoin, not XT.  Should you not be describing Core as the altcoin?  After all, XT does not fork the chain until it is the economic majority? In that case, isn't it true that XT can never be the altcoin?
You chose a broad definition of altcoin--broader than has ever been considered--so that you could call XT an altcoin because you think it helps you persuade people not to use XT.  But the definition is so broad that even present Core is an altcoin under foreseeable and likely solutions (when it could just be the shorter chain).  That's an absurd outcome from your definition of the word.  Why don't you back off the position and revisit your definition and look for more distinction before determining something an altcoin?  It's an argument that should die.
I shouldn't have called you out; I just thought it was ironic that the situation would, under your definition, make Bitcoin Core an altcoin, and wanted to see how you felt about that.

There are not. Presently, the only popular viable options are LN and cap increase.  The cap increase hinders the LN, which happens to be the most elegant solution to date and was not even introduced until only February--not long ago.  The cap increase also hinders decentralization.  In spite of Moore's "law," it will make it such that more resources are required to run a node.
Curiously, we are being forced to "choose" one or the other, as if the matter were urgent, but it's not.  We can continue to wait for LN development.  If the blocks start to fill--from real demand--leading to large enough fee increases to discourage usage, a cap increase will be welcomed in order to preserve the value of the network.  In the meantime we can wait.  There is no urgency.  This has nothing to do with fear, just reason.  It makes no sense to force a needless change that will exclude the most elegant Bitcoin scaling solution introduced to date simply to stick with the "original" plan.  This "urgency" is manufactured.
Edit:  I just realized that you were the same guy who did not know that 8GB was hard odes into XT.  I was wondering why some of your arguments were so off-the-wall.  You just went and did a few minutes worth of research to try to win an argument purely for the sake of not losing it.  
I'm not sitting here spinning my wheels to be the correct one.  I'm trying to make people realize why this "urgency" is manufactured.  I want to see Bitcoin succeed, and the cap increase is not the best way unless Bitcoin is about to fail without it, and in spite of Gavin's May 4 proclamation otherwise, Bitcoin is not in urgent need of repair.  The stress tests prove this.

This is the point most people don't get.
What rewards will induce the hash power to secure the network when block rewards are gone?  The answer is only fees.  There are two competing ways fees can do it.  Either lots of small fees through lots of transactions (which will consume huge amounts of resources and cause the centralization of Bitcoin) or through fewer BC transactions with larger fees, which protects decentralization.  However, if there are few transactions with low fees, miners leave.  If lightning were to develop without a fee market in place, Bitcoin would be vulnerable.  This is the scenario that happens under an implementation of both XT and Lightning.  Why would we hinder LN, the more elegant solution, when cap increase is not urgent?  It makes no sense.
@_date: 2015-08-20 14:03:39
the only thing that happens when the 1MB limit is reached is fees temporarily increase (with proper wallet implementation).

I still see no "urgency."  You made up 48h (like Gavin made up urgent).  Stress tests showed otherwise.
You make these things up so that people will conclude--on a false premise--that they better agree to the increase or Bitcoin will break.  But if that's not true, then there is no urgency.  Meanwhile, while everyone may not need to run a node, solutions are being developed that would make it so that everyone COULD run a node.  If there is no urgency why not wait on those?

I think the answer lies first with high-volume merchants.  They should prefer Bitcoin over credit cards; so much that they offer discounts for paying with Bitcoin (similar to cash payment discounts for Diesel purchases, or similar to how target offers a 5% discount for using the red card).  When users can save for using Bitcoin, then it becomes worth using, at least as a medium of exchange.  For users who want no holding risk, they can have a bitreserve or similar account.  Then they can make "Bitcoin" purchases by only holding Bitcoin for seconds, but still save money on those purchases.  This would be a good place for most people to start.
When big merchants figure out that they can actually save money with Bitcoin and then pickup customers by splitting those savings with those customers, we might start to see some real world everyday type usage.

The system was introduced in theory in February and is actively being developed.  Although an alpha of LN has been produced, it's not useable.  Unfortunately hard coding a cap increase to an eventual 7.6 GB will preempt this system by making that $20 BC fee impossible to achieve, thereby leaving the BC insecure under a LN implementation.  This, while making Bitcoin less decentralized (by the way, Hearn has always wanted black lists).
Curiously, it was not made "urgent" to increase the cap until shortly after the LN was introduced.  However, the "stress tests" have shown absolutely no urgency for anything other than dynamic fees in wallets.


As you say, we would be **lucky**.  At that point (assuming we are that lucky) a fork to double the cap limit would be easy to gain consensus for if fees were high enough to hinder usage.  Presently all of the Bip proposals support greater than 2MB (there would probably even be consensus for 8MB at that point).  A small cap increase is an easy fix if the problem is urgent.  While it's not urgent why not give the better solution time to develop?
What I'm saying makes a lot of sense.  Something stinks here.  In 2013 Gavin was opposed to trusted off-chain solutions to scaling, but as soon as a trustless off-chain solution emerges he partners with the pro blacklist guy to preempt it.

How do we get society to quit agreeing to value dollars and start valuing Bitcoin?  It sure as hell isn't by misunderstanding the competition or denying/underestimating its strengths.

What rewards will induce the hash power to secure the network when block rewards are gone?  The answer is only fees.  There are two competing ways fees can do it.  Either lots of small fees through lots of transactions (which will consume huge amounts of resources and cause the centralization of Bitcoin) or through fewer BC transactions with larger fees, which protects decentralization.  However, if there are few transactions with low fees, miners leave.  If lightning were to develop without a fee market in place, Bitcoin would be vulnerable.  This is the scenario that happens under an implementation of both XT and Lightning.  Thus, if the cap is increased LN will not be able to be implemented.  Why would we hinder LN, the more elegant solution, when cap increase is not urgent?  It makes no sense.
While the other solutions you mentioned are okay with me, there is no urgency to implement.  This urgency to choose either XT or core is manufactured.  There is no urgency and XT comes with serious costs.

It's not even developed.  The stress tests have shown there is no urgency to increase the cap.  Implementing XT will hinder LN implementation.  I'm fine with a block cap increase (not hard coding 7.6 GB) when the problem is at least close to urgent.  But this urgency is completely manufactured.
@_date: 2015-08-20 21:39:44


They would bother for the same reason I currently do even though I rarely transact and then use an SPV when I do; they want their money out of the control of government and running a node determines which blocks are related.  Furthermore, it costs me very little (practically nothing to run the node).  This remains true no matter the fee.  Running a node supports the foundation of the currency; I would do that no matter how I conduct transactions.  That is, of course, unless it is too costly.
At this point, I can tell you've been persuaded.  And although it has not completely settled, if you give it a day or two it will fully sink in that this urgency is manufactured.  At that point, you should start asking people to explain the urgency as well.  It makes no sense.
You do realize that many transactions are made with no need to be confirmed in the next block.  Dynamic fee implementations could estimate to allow users to pay more for faster confirmations and less for those that could confirm anytime of the day?  How much of the current real traffic needs next block confirmation?  My point is that the urgency was manufactured and the stress tests prove that.  We can hold off before jumping aboard any increase, much less XT.  Bitcoin is not about to break.
@_date: 2015-08-14 15:43:49
This makes no sense.  Users did not leave.  Bitcoin is fine even though Blocks were full and lowest-fee transactions took a long time to confirm (still far less time than for a check to clear).  Where is the urgency.
@_date: 2015-08-20 12:59:58


This is the crux of the issue.  Gavin did not make this urgent until LN--**a trust less solution**--was introduced.  He knows damn well that his solution preempts the better solution.  Why the hell did he manufacture the urgency to increase the cap? The "stress tests," in spite of their intended purpose, have shown exactly no urgency for anything other than dynamic fee wallet implementations which can certainly happen before January 11.
@_date: 2015-08-14 20:12:02
If I get the impression  Bitcoin is about to break I'll install the patched code to up a one-time increase.  I'll probably just jump on the bandwagon to support the most popular number (whether 2M 8m, whatevs).  Until it's urgent I'm not bothering.  There are potentially better solutions in development.

I can't tell if you said that just to be funny or if you actually disagree with what the dictionary defines the meaning of the word to be.
Nonetheless, it is social agreement that gives value to the dollar, Bitcoin, and gold alike.  This is not a fact to run from, but one to embrace, as most see Bitcoin as having no intrinsic value, while failing to realize that neither does the dollar (or gold to support most of its value).    To realize that all of these only have value due to social agreement makes it easier for society to begin to agree to value something new (Bitcoin).  To realize that the value is only derived by agreement would cause some to start comparing the properties of various alternatives to the dollar, and on comparison Bitcoin is the obvious better choice.

I think there are a few people with grossly outweighed influence over the network (I would like to see their influence dispersed amongst more).  I think that changes to the consensus rules within the network requires consensus among that group.  I think that group is heavily influenced by a few who have demonstrated grossly superior technical understanding of the network and economy.  I think the rest of the "community" is mostly a giant circle-jerk with very little actual influence especially individually.  On the other hand, I think the market which encompasses some of the "community" has great influence in decision-making, but it speaks for itself; most of what the community threatens regarding market is bullshit.


We need fees to rise.  We need to set proper expectations for blockchain usage.  I'm not presently worried about people using Bitcoin to purchase tiny shit.  I want to see them using it to store and transfer large amounts of wealth.  I want it to be an ungovernable reserve currency before anything else.  I don't hate VISA or Paypal.  There's no animus that leads me to want them destroyed.  Hell, I'm good if their payment networks make Bitcoin useful as an ordinary means of exchange.
Notwithstanding the above, I do think it is useful to have decentralized trustless means of exchanging Bitcoin at VISA-like levels.  I think that will aid in achieving the first goal.  But I won't sacrifice the main thing just to achieve a secondary objective.  To do that would merely create a one-world fiat currency.  That sucks!
The network effect I am interested in is the effect on store of value.  I want people saving Bitcoin because other people save Bitcoin.  I think the only reason people will do this is if they are convinced that it is immutably inflation-proof (i.e. practically ungovernable due to difficult to garner consensus and the threat of mutually assured value destruction if changes are attempted without that consensus).  This is what I value most in Bitcoin.  I want it to be digital gold.  If people can figure out how to perform world-wide scaled transactions with it, then even better--but that is secondary.

Notwithstanding consensus, it seems is saying that 2MB HF with Segwit (without a  blocksize increase) can both be achieved as safely as a 2MB HF alone and without any beneficial loss from Segwit as currently planned.
Accordingly, if you guys were looking to compromise (bring peace), it could be done this way if there is consensus for 2MB HF.
But I don't think this is the best way to go.  I think the Core plan is better, and principle suggests sticking with the best technical plan, rather than compromising for political pressure.

By structuring the transactions like this old nodes see the inputs and outputs of all segwit transactions, but they do not comprehend the witness data.  Instead, the transactions are viewed by the old nodes as "anyone can spend."  Accordingly, old nodes will continue to follow and retain the chain of transactions.  With a hard fork, all old nodes will quit following the chain.
Side note: anyone-can-spend is kindof a misnomer because any attempt to spend such a transaction will not relay.

While I'm all for patents (when used properly to encourage innovation), I'm even more of a proponent of making minor tweaks to nullify any patented hack that gives one miner an unfair advantage over others.
The whole point of proof of work is to have an equal playing field to create an unwinnable arms race.  This is what keeps Bitcoin decentralized an ungovernable.  **Without fixing this, we are allowing only one ASIC manufacturer to monopolize the system by forging "proof" for work they didn't actually perform.**
While patent laws are ideally designed to encourage innovation, this sort of usage is exactly the type of abuse that anti-trust laws are intended to punish.  But this is still the Wild West, so there's not much hope of an immediate legal fix for the scenario.  But again, thankfully, this can be fixed with a small tweak to the code.

Independent research lead me to Gavin's post.  It's damning to your cause.
The truth is Gavin and you and all of you know that SegWit will provide all the capacity we need while the HF is pending.  Moreover, you know that Segwit is a great improvement that fixes other issues.  And you know that the extra time to implement a HF will reduce the risk of its failure.

Suppose XT wins a majority (or 75% or whatever).  Won't core just change the code to support the bigger blocks--or else be left behind?
If core updates the code, then whether you run XT or Core will not matter, as they are the same (unless you run the XT.A which will have differences).  If this becomes the case, then this fork will have proven that Core devs don't have control over the protocol, just some influence.  However, in proving this, it will also prove that Hearn, although having control over XT, doesn't have control over Bitcoin.  After core gets updated, and with the code being the same, users could then easily switch back to Core.
I don't see how showing that users can switch code gives Hearn more power than the current devs give the illusion of having right now.  Ultimately, the move will reduce the influence or perceived power that any dev has.  Sure, Hearn will be in control of XT, but so what?  If we could switch to XT we will damn well know that we can switch to something else if we want.  We will know that users have the control, and there will be no misunderstanding that fact.

Talks of doing a thing like this have been going on since before UT hedged with gold.  
There are no cons to this bill other than possible legal challenges and political fights with the U.S.  If successful, Texas will have created a gold backed currency that does not operate on fractional reserves.  Texans understand that that only provides options.  This new currency could be used the world over.  The vault will be used as a store of value that is better than all other fiat currencies which are subject to inflation.  People would flock there to store their wealth?  Texas is about to surpass both NY and CA for number of Fortune 500 companies headquartered there, and is looking to become a dominant financial hub in the world.  This move aims to serve that end.  The move also promotes the independence of the state.  It is not some little trick that simply saves UT storage cost on their gold.  It's Big!  Except...

I don't think this their plan.  I think Brian Armstrong has a sincerely held (but not fully considered) belief that the Core chain will cease to have a market value.  I don't think he has a plan for what to do if both chains have value (much less if the Core chain had higher value).
I suspect what he will do is spend some time trying to deny the validity of the original chain in hopes of the market devaluing the chain completely.  I don't think he would sell them on another exchange.  But I do suspect it will be difficult to get your coins.
I guess he could say that all he owes you is Bitcoins (and ClassicCoin is the only true Bitcoin).  But if he did this and the old chain still had value, he would likely be spending time with Shrem--so I doubt he would.  Who knows though?  He's a loose cannon.

I clearly said in the same post that difficulty could be changed by Core for those who want to continue mining it.  You could even implement an algorithm change back to thousands of decentralized home miners.


If you read and understand the white paper you will know that "longest chain" is referring to how to solve the problem of multiple miners solving the next block at about the same time and how to determine which will become the valid block.  This is in essence the longest chain under the same consensus rules.  But if you produce a block that does not conform to the 1MB consensus rule, the node does not need the longest chain rule, it just excludes it.  You will have two chains (both still operating under the longest chain rule).  The question is which is valued by the market?  Why the new?
You really need to reconsider.  Don't satisfy yourself with bulletpoint phrases like longest chain.

Such a worthless proposal.  The Bitcoin community is very close to showing how the incentives give miners very little (practically none) leverage to dictate terms. 
Why would we now start to give in to their demands for a meaningless hard fork?  All that would do is unnecessarily delay Jihan's much-needed, learned-the-hard-way education.
We don't need "peace" from Jihan; we've already shown that he's toothless.  We need either status quo or BIP148.
Regardless of what a few devs decide, large holders aren't going for this.  The only "important" individuals who will like this are those who fear that we are about to finally prove that miners are mostly powerless.

Suppose 25% of miners who wish not to switch calculate that some of the 75% will quickly switch back to the 1MB chain if it has market value, but the 2MB chain does not.  Aren't they correct?  i.e.  If the market does not immediately (or very quickly) start valuing the forked chain more than the original (the one with the network effect as the first mover), then won't the 75% be compelled to switch back?  If the 25% know this, is there really any pressure to switch during a 30 day waiting period (I mean, after all, they can always switch IF the market does)?

You suggest making more room for more wasteful spam.  No amount of artful word-weaving changes that result.  Satoshi's spam eliminating feature was not the cap, it was the concomitant fee--the cap was the means to make the fee prohibitive.
Because people can and do fill the remainder of blocks with spam, the only measure for true usage is fee.

You said blindly (not me).  I say reasonably following Core's lead.  There are a lot of technical issues that aren't fully understood by most users.  Those users have to rely on others to inform them on the technical ramifications in order to "make their own decisions."  People routinely make their own decisions based on trusted advice; life is unworkable otherwise.  The CEO is often not the engineer.
There are many (myself included) who understand generally what you guys say, but that understanding is laughable compared to your expertise.  There are many others who do not even understand on my basic level.  Regardless, we all have to rely on the expertise of others and reliance requires trust.  The only question then is whom to trust.  The Core developers have earned that trust by (1) having never lead astray and (2) having always provided reasonable explanations.
Accordingly, there may be many (and I suspect there are) who would agree to a HF if it were not contentious, but are reluctant only because those they reasonably/justifiably trust caution them not to.  That seems like no reason to say Bitcoin deserves to fail--many complicated matters work this way, which is why learning whom to trust is a most valuable skill.
For the same reasons, if those people were told by Core (and had it explained) that we could and should safely HF to 2MB (which we could if the only holdouts are relying on Core's leadership) and that at the same time we could add SW without the size increase and retain most of the material benefits (as you say), those people would be reasonable to follow the lead.
However, because people trust Core, I think that it is best for Core to stick with the principle of always coding what is technically better.  In this instance there may be no material difference in the ultimate outcome, but the roadmap path is technically better; it does not subject the ecosystem to the risk of a HF.  To compromise for political reasons would likely come at a price of that hard-earned trust.
For these reasons (and others) I say stick to the roadmap even if 100% of holdouts required for unanimity are merely relying on Core.  And... if it forks anyway, then implementation of the algo change would seem most appropriate, especially if it forks without the economy following (i.e. miner driven only).

This is my quick take:
LN is about developing a routing system that can make these type payment channels interoperable.
These 21 channels just let you open a channel and transact with one person (apparently unidirectionally).  That's been in Bitcoin for a long time, but no one ever develops uses for it.
The LN will allow a person to open a channel like this and then send a payment to someone they haven't opened a channel with.  In practice, the node the payor opens a channel with will have several channels open and payments will be routed between numerous payment channels until the destination is reached.  This could take 10 hops, but it will be super fast because no confirmations.
By 21 adding this, they are simply incrementally building up to the eventual LN.  It's a good step.  Also, it's a good way to show the need for the LN; once people use this and like it, they will critique it for being limited to payments with only one person.
Somebody correct me if I'm wrong.

Probably a great deal of it is spam.
Coinwallet was spamming with the intention of filling the blocks and thereby causing people to implement XT.  Their problem was they announced their plan and intention.
There is likely an ongoing attack.  One strong bit of evidence to suggest this is that fees never increase.  It costs very little to take up remaining block space after bona fide transactions.  But it is very costly to push out the bona fide transactions; the only way to do that would be to start a fee bid war.
Apparently Satoshi's DOS preventer is working.
A lot of people go off on a tangent of absurdity to suggest that there is no such thing as a spam transaction.  But if not, what was the DOS attack Satoshi was trying to prevent?  Flooding the chain with bona fide transactions?  Of course not, he was trying to make it cost prohibitive to flood the chain with wasteful transactions--Spam.
@_date: 2016-02-22 22:48:25


It is accurate.  SegWit provides for this.


Slowly is unsupported.  Market pressures require that its usage will be adopted as fast as it needs to be to keep fees from rising.  That's the only reason block size matters anyway.  But other reasons suggest that SegWit adoption will be much faster than the fee pressure requires.


Not true.  Here are wallets supporting SegWit
Ledger says the changes are easy to implement:


I think that also pretty much kills this statement


So from very early on, SegWit will be supported by most wallets.  The choice of the user will be to either pay higher fees or lower.  That makes for very quick adoption.  And backing that up is the compelling factor of potential rising fees.  As long as adoption is faster than this (or responsive to it), it does not matter when block sizes are larger.
You got anything else?  Get out of the echo chamber.
@_date: 2016-02-10 13:38:18


All that happens is fees begin to slowly rise.  Those fees then ebb and flow with demand.  It's not Armageddon.


We're making progress.  Now you acknowledge that the blocks are "filled" with lots of spam.
Yet, strangely, you suggest making room for more Spam.  As long as fees are low, spam transactions will fill the remainder of the blocks (and the mempool).  Raise it to 10 MB, and someone can easily generate 9.5 MB of transactions to fill the remainder, generating way more costly waste.  Hence the spam filter.

This is not true if the remainder of the economy needed to form consensus (enough consensus) is merely following Core's lead.
I think this is quite likely the case, although I do not know for sure.
If it is true, economic consensus for a straight 2MB Hardfork would be formed by Core's acquiescence.
Nonetheless, I do not think this is the best move.  The better technical move is the roadmap, and I think the best political move is the to stick to the principle of following technicals.  Long-term this will prove valuable.  If the miners go the other way, I like your algo change idea to fix what will then be proven to be a huge problem--mining centralization.
With all that said, I doubt this chain is going to have the coded 75% (or 80 or whatever) requisite to fork.  I'm not sure what % of hash power is held by relatively small miners, but it seems to me that they do not have the incentive to fork and that they are likely savvy enough to realize what is technically better.  However, I wish I had data to support the conjecture.

Here, all that matters is that blocks filling is not resulting in a fee increase.  Accordingly, some of those transactions are wasteful spam.  Otherwise, fees would rise.

You can't.  You are wrong and he is right.


That's your problem, right there.  Gavin new better than to do this, obviously user behavior is going to change drastically (mostly without the users even realizing it).




Here's what indicates a change in user behavior:
Your wallet automatically starts giving you addresses that begin with 3 instead of 1, and your wallet keeps multiple keys and gives multiple signatures when you make a transaction.  It does this to save you money on transactions.
Here's a list of wallets that are going to change user behavior in that way.
It's easy according to Ledger


Of Course, user behavior doesn't actually change, they still just scan QR codes and press send, but their wallets have certainly changed the way the transactions are executed.

A years-long war has been fought to block SegWit for all sorts of nonsensical "reasons."  The real reason, we discover, is because it inadvertently blocked covert ASICBoost, which is worth about $100million.  There will be a shit ton of manufactured "controversy."  To spot a shill, simply look for anyone insisting/implying ASICBoost is an optimization.  These will be many of the same people who have been being paid to cause enough trouble to block SegWit.
@_date: 2016-02-22 20:47:20
I'm just quoting Gavin.  Gavin loves Segwit because everybody will, of course, "move[] their coins to segregated witness-locked outputs and all transactions are using segregated witness," because their wallets will do it for them to save them money and so that "two or three times as many transactions would squeeze into the one megabyte block limit."
None of my transactions are complicated now.  I just scan a QR and click send.  None of the space-saving SegWit transactions will be complicated either.  Just scan a QR and click send.  The "complicated" stuff is handled by the wallet (as it always is).
It's time for you to realize that you are wrong and that you are so absent vision that even after months of consideration you have failed to see what Gavin (of all people?) recognized as soon as he heard of SegWit.

The more change resistant something is, the more immutable it is.   Immutability is the whole idea behind the design of Bitcoin.  It is built in through "game theory."  Obviously anyone can change some code.  But getting everyone to agree to the change is difficult.  If you only get a majority, implementing that change risks destroying the very interest that motivates the change.  That is the design theory that makes Bitcoin immutable.

Of course, and a lot of those will soon be confirmed.  But those 33k transactions at the top sitting and waiting on confirmation represent less that 1 BTC in fees.  Those are the ones that "fill" the remainder of blocks as the miners have room.

First, I think the decent thing for you to do would be to acknowledge that you were wrong.  Instead you are spinning in circles trying to figure out how you could still somehow be right.  To do so you are hurling nonsense.


Not true.  Once the first 2MB block is added to the new chain and the only old chain are incompatible.  In Bitcoin, each block contains a hash of the previous block (ironically, this is crucial for the actual longest chain rule).
The nodes from each chain chain are communicating, but they are rejecting the others' blocks indefinitely.
You have two chains.  One that has always had a market value, and one that never has.  What will make the new one all of the sudden have a higher value than the old one? If it doesn't what will stop the miners from switching back so they can make money again?

What are you a Savant?
On real-world planet earth, even terms of absolute are in practice terms of degree.  Words rarely operate in binary, they are colored by context.
Most cryptos are designed with immutability as a goal.  We can compare the degrees to which they achieve this end.  While all will be technically able to change, practice may prove that it is too difficult.  These will be deemed immutable, notwithstanding the technical possibility.  Between practical and technical there are varying degrees.

I'm sorry to have offended you.  Philosophically, I suppose all of your views of privacy are fine.  I'm a big proponent of privacy rights.
However, you were correcting my assertions that privacy is a fundamental right to say that it would be better to describe it differently.  But in the context of the legal questions facing Apple and all U.S. Citizens regarding encryption, there is absolutely no more accurate way to describe the general right.  A "fundamental right" is a legal term of art.  In US jurisprudence There are no rights more legally protected against government interference than "fundamental rights."  Griswold v. Connecticut established the right to privacy as highly protected.  Later cases in its line clarified it as "fundamental."
The constitutional question is whether the right extends to encryption.  I think it will.  As much as the right would extend to whispering.  But the Supreme Court has never had occasion to answer the question--government has never tried to ban the attempt to seek to preserve privacy.  However, there is some case law that runs contrary to my thinking (but they can be distinguished).
The real problem is that even if the Court would find the right exists, it's practically impossible for the government snooping to be challenged.  In order to challenge, a person has to show injury, which can't be easily done (how can you prove they were reading your texts without a warrant?).

@_date: 2016-02-17 15:08:33
I concur.
I don't actually think a fork is imminent.  However, it it did, I'd love to be a fly on the wall when the big miners who decided to fork realize that the new coin has little value, and now switching back to the old chain sucks, because the confusion has destroyed its value too.  What a clusterfuck.
I don't think it's going to take much longer for the miners to realize that they don't have the influence they thought.  All the lobbying makes them seem important, but the truth is, one side is lobbying them only because if they do this it will hurt Bitcoin badly (which is against their interest).  Once they figure out that it could (likely would) devastate their interest, they realize that they are powerless without the market shifting first and in concert.
This is good stuff.  However, it does kindof suck to realize that a fork to ever adjust the block cap may be practically impossible.  It would be nice to ultimately have some sort of automatically adjusting cap.  But I don't know how to get around this problem without everyone actually committing to supporting both chains and letting the market decide.  Even that takes a lot of concerted effort.

No they don't.


I'll agree.  But long-term considerations can come into the decision, rather than just myopically considering the next block.  So suppose that 75% agree to fork and 25% continue to mine the chain with a long-established proven market value.  At the moment of fork, do all exchanges just abandon the chain they have supported for years and pretend the new chain is the one true chain?  Or do they add support for the new chain and let the market decide how to value them?  What if some exchanges just keep supporting the old chain, but not the new?
You will have some exchanges whose Bitcoin represents one chain, some whose Bitcoin represents new, and some who have two Bitcoins:  Classic and the classic Bitcoin.  In this scenario, what makes the market all of the sudden shift to the new chain?  If it does not suddenly shift, then won't Classic miners just shift back, realizing their miscalculation through loss of ROI?
But then in that scenario, won't there still be some who continue to mine Classic (for principle and in hopes of long-term value)?  If so, won't that chain also continue to have a market value?  If your exchange does not support Classic, but holds the keys that work on either chain, do they get to keep your value on the Classic Chain?
It seems the only way for exchanges to properly deal with this is to support both chains.  But if they do that, then the market will schism when we need the market to simultaneously make a wholesale shift.
@_date: 2016-02-22 20:32:36
What's your hurry?
Consider these quotes from Gavin:




Segwit will buy as much time (if not more) than Classic.  July 2017 is not pressing.
Why be hurried?  There are lots of things that can go wrong with a hard fork.  For instance.  What happens if the old chain is still viable and exchanges support both at the same time (or only the old chain).  How quickly will the miners switch back to the old chain when their rewards prove to have no value?  If part of the network continues to operate on the old chain and part on the new, with market values representing the same value, but for two different incompatible chains, do you think the market is going to respond well to that confusion?
In order to pull off a hard fork with without having the market spooked, pretty much everyone needs to agree all at once to let the old chain die and to treat the forked chain as if it were the old.  That needs a lot of headroom with exchanges, wallets, paryment providers, etc. all having plenty of time to coordinate.
Why do you think the big miners won't touch Classic?  It's suicidal.  They depend on the market value of the coin, and a hard fork risks a lot.
Given that Core provides more than even Classic (according to Gavin), why would you be in such a hurry?

**This is important to understand regarding the political implications of BIP148 on Vertcoin and a MASF on Litecoin.**
Vertcoin is the new battleground.  Here's why:
The only reason Jihan wanted to block SegWit on litecoin was to make it politically easier to block SegWit on Bitcoin; a favorable precedent for SegWit makes arguing against it more difficult.  Blocking SegWit on Bitcoin is all about protecting ASICBoost.  Ultimately, however, Jihan is fine if Litecoin activates SegWit, so long as Bitcoin does not.
A UASF is the biggest threat to successfully activate SegWit on Bitcoin, therefore, Jihan would like to show a UASF to be dangerous.  Accordingly, Jihan needs a UASF attempt to fail in order to set an unfavorable precedent, making it more difficult to win support for in Bitcoin.  But this can only happen with a majority of hash power willfully attacking a UASF after activation.  Jihan does not have the ability to successfully attack Litecoin, so he is better off miner-activating SegWit on Litecoin.  Otherwise, a favorable precedent will be set for BIP148.
**Enter Vertcoin.**  Last week, it appeared that Vertcoin was about to miner-activate SegWit (and Litecoin was likely to implement a UASF).  All of the sudden, someone blocked activation by adding more than 100% of Vertcoin's prior-existing hashrate to their network.  This miner now has more than 51% of the hashrate and is signaling against SegWit.  As a response, Vertcoin is implementing BIP148.
Now, the roles are reversed, Vertcoin is implementing a UASF and Litecoin is miner-activating.   But unlike Litecoin, it is possible to successfully attack Vertcoin.  First, the hash power is readily available to successfully 51% attack.  Second, the market cap is low enough to successfully manipulate the price action to give the post-attack impression that the market is accepting the non-SegWit chain.
In essence, by switching the roles of Litecoin and SegWit, Jihan could establish enough FUD against a UASF that the only option for activating SegWit on Bitcoin is through miners.  Of course, in order to protect ASICBoost, this will never happen.  Bitcoin will be stuck with Jihan as its ruler.
Right now, Vertcoin may need some help to thrive through the coming attacks.
We have a choice.  Vertcoin can either be an example of why a UASF is the way to go, or it will be the perfect example of what can go wrong.

"Anyone can spend" is sort of a misnomer.  A broadcasted transaction that includes an anyone-can-spend utxo won't relay through the network.  A mine would have to intentionally and affirmatively go out of its way to mine a transaction that does this.  And doing this would require a hard-forked 51% attack, because undoing any soft fork requires a hard fork, regardless of how it's activated.
Replay protection is not a thing with soft forks.

Sure does.  In fact, it's higher than 2 MB if people are using 15/15 multisig (which a wallet can automate for you allowing you to hold all 15 keys).  Because you will save fees, the incentive will be there to perform these transactions as Segwit transactions.  Especially among high volume users.

@_date: 2016-02-12 18:08:43
You're confused.  Bitcoin is designed such that if only 51% is garnered in an attempt to change the rules, the market will likely tank.  This market incentive stops the attempt since miners are reliant upon mark prices.
If 90% of miners try the same thing, the result might be the same.  Market direction is influenced by the miners, but the market is not necessarily inclined to follow.  If the market decides it doesn't like a Bitcoin where a few miners can change the rules.  Accordingly, the market may stick with the old chain.  More likely, however, is that the market will abandon both (assuming a great percentage dislike that a few miners are imposing changes).  In that case the value of both chains could be tanked.  One would expect this disincentive to stop miners.
This market incentive (which is social in nature) is what is, by design, supposed to make Bitcoin immutable.  To ignore this facet is to completely misunderstand Bitcoin.
In order to change the rules of Bitcoin without risking tanking the market, there must be such overwhelming evidence of user support that the few who disagree are inconsequential--economic consensus.
Accordingly, in order to change the rules--without market chaos--there must be manifest economic consensus.  This does not even have to include the current miners if part of the rule change is a new mining algorithm.  The problem is gaining economic consensus is very hard.  Practically impossible.  So changing the consensus rules, while technically possible with only 51%, is practically impossible without economic consensus, because the miners should not want to risk the market price that they rely upon.
This immutability design is what makes Bitcoin so brilliant.  It's designed to be change resistant so long as it remains decentralized.

@_date: 2016-02-17 12:25:40
That's the way it is hoped to work.  But in reality there will still be miners mining the old chain.  In fact, there could just as easily be an algo change and difficulty change for the old chain that would allow ordinary individuals to again begin mining with little cost to themselves.
In that scenario you have two chains.  The old chain has always had the established market value and the new one has not.  If you hold your own keys, you have value on either chain.   But if an exchange holds your coins you only have access to your coins on both chains if they support both chains.
So for instance, it seems Coinbase will only support the ClassicCoinChain, which has never had a market value.  Does this mean that they just keep the value behind the CoreCoinChain, which has always had a market value?
In reality, there would likely be no algo shift.  Instead, there would be a few miners who still choose to mine the CoinChain that has the established market value.  When there is a fork, there then becomes two mined chains.  Most exchanges will continue to support the chain they always have supported and would have to add support for the new chain.  Then, if the market does not quickly abandon the chain it has always valued, the miners on the new chain would have an oh-shit-moment and switch back to mining on the chain that has value.
More realistic is that the market will be so confused that both chains have a combined value of way less than $400.
The way I could see this working is only if all the exchanges, all online wallets, all miners, and most market participants all agreed to ignore the old chain and let it die and in concert treat the new chain as the old.  Then value could just sort of be tricked into adopting the new chain.  But if there are market participants who want the old chain, some exchanges will support it and it will continue to have value.  In fact, in that scenario, it will be the chain that has always had value.
This would be one hell of a clusterfuck.

Nonsense.  Author draws the conclusion that Blockstream raising $55mm will cause support for Classic to wane.
Support for Classic is dying because it's simply not as good of an idea.  Segwit provides practically the same single "benefit" that Classic offers, plus others (malleability fix and a means of implementing Confidential Transactions - **complete privacy and fungibility**); segwit is already coded; and segwit will soon be implemented via a safer SOFT fork.
Key core developers at Blockstream have devised a superior roadmap.  And as time passes the market is understanding the brilliance of their plan.  Accordingly, the $55m is an effect caused by their brilliance that leads to winning this battle.  Yet, the author suggests that the tail is wagging the dog??
Moreover, Blockstream's business model works even after a 2MB hard fork.  Author's conclusions do not withstand even mild scrutiny.  I suspect the author might be attempting to incite even more misplaced vigorous rage fitting aimed at the Core developers who have successfully assembled Blockstream.  Regardless, he is right about one thing--Classic is failing in its devs' shameful attempt to usurp Bitcoin for the sake of power.

No it's not.  ASICs are still performing the same amount of requisite hashes, just faster. I'd call that an optimization.  What these guys are doing is skipping the work (skipping a lot of the hashes).  It's no different than a quantum breakthrough.

@_date: 2016-02-17 03:40:40
Do people realize this?
If it were not for people using exchanges (which requires storing on exchanges) then Bitcoin would not have much value.
Because exchanges don't want people to pull their funds off, it seems most would support both (except maybe Coinbase).
CoreCoin already has an established market value.  If the exchanges are running both chains why will the value shift completely from  CoreCoin to ClassicCoin?
If it does not happen very quickly, then won't 75% of the miners be mining coins on a chain that has no value (or much less than the other)?  If so, won't many of them shift back?
But, maybe they won't shift back.  Maybe instead of the market giving Classic value, it just gets spooked and gives neither coin much value.  In that case, it seems much of the hash power dies off altogether for a while and comes back slowly to the two different chains as the market values of each compete with one another for miner support.
Seems like one hell of a clusterfuck.  The only way to prevent this is if all the exchanges agree that upon a hard fork they will not support the exchange of CoreCoins, but will send CoreCoins to their customers upon request.
When the new chain comes on it is important that the market value for the old chain also die.  How do you make this happen without market consensus?  Is it really enough for only 75% of miners to agree?
If the market for the old chain does not die, then there can be one hell of a shit show.

Not true.  It's higher than 2 MB if people are using 15/15 multisig (which a wallet can automate for you allowing you to hold all 15 keys).  Because you will save fees, the incentive will be there to perform these transactions as Segwit transactions.  Especially among high volume users.
@_date: 2017-04-10 10:43:17


No.  I'd distinguish an optimization as allowing them to perform the work (hashes) faster or with less electricity.  This allows skipping the hashes (work).  That's a cheat.

That's not what I said.  What I'm saying is that the blocks are not full until spam cannot fit in them.  That scenario manifests itself through fee rise.
Raising the cap without fee pressure simply unnecessarily makes room for more wasteful spam.


It seems to me that 1000000 may have had reasons, but within a range the exact number was arbitrary.  So what?  All you are suggesting is raising it; presently that will do nothing but allow for more spam.  The fact that Satoshi was trying to prevent Spam was not at all arbitrary.

Haha.  No it's not.  What do you know about burdens of proof, persuasion, and production?  The blockchain works under a preference for status quo (in law that's a presumption), which places the burden on those who want change to persuade those who maintain the chain.  It's an unusually high burden (consensus of some sort).
Nonetheless, I have produced persuasive evidence and rationale.  The fees don't increase.  If the blocks were filled with bona fide transactions fees would increase.  That's Satoshi's purpose for the cap; it keeps out the wasteful transactions by making them costly.
@_date: 2016-02-17 03:55:59
Source?  The only one I know of was the one in 2013 that **had complete agreement**--there was an error that created lots of fake coins in the chain.  Ironically, it was caused by Hearn.
In this instance, there are plenty who don't want to fork.  But a few miners could do it anyway.  25% may keep mining the original chain.
In that case you have two chains.  Some exchanges could run the new chain exclusively.  Some could run the old exclusively.  It seems most would support both.  How do you get the market to shift from the old chain to the new?
If all exchanges and market participants were in agreement to value only the new chain, then I could see miners being forced (by getting a reward of zero value) to quit mining the old chain.  But here, instead of the market necessarily deciding to value a new chain, it seems that miners (75%) would be choosing to mine a chain the market has not agreed to value.

Additionally, you need to be able to send the block to multiple connections at the same time.  All while keeping the mempool fairly synced.
@_date: 2016-02-17 04:02:20
This is not that difficult to grasp or explain.  It's a lot more tangible than the technicals that most can only pretend to understand.  It seems the question needs to be asked everywhere:
If you store your coins on an exchange that only supports one chain, but both have some value, does the exchange keep the value?
The answer leads to so many problems.

What the hell was Satoshi thinking then?  Why did he put in a cap at all?  An infinite cap would have made spam infinitely expensive.  What a dipshit!?!  He could have solved the whole problem by doing nothing.
Oh wait... Damn... I just realized, every transaction has a cost to the network that does not change with the fee (cost for bandwidth, storage, validation, etc.) and he needed a method to make individual transactions too costly for spam transactions to make up a bulk of the total transactions.  If he left no cap, it would have been infinitely costly to send infinite spam, but it still would have been much cheaper to spam the chain than it would have been to maintain the chain.  The same is true with a 10 MB cap.  Shit, I guess the real solution is to have the cap either relatively low or maybe floating with actual demand somehow measured by fees.
@_date: 2016-02-22 22:27:03


Wrong.  It's if great majority are using multi-sig, not "every single" one. 
He is saying he expects almost every single transaction to use multi-sig, because the wallets will, of course, implement it by default.  You will have a multi-sig address, and the wallet will store both keys and sign both signatures.  Easy-peezy.
I'm having a hard time believing you are this dense.


Who gives a rip about right now?  Wallets don't implement right now, because there is no benefit right now.  But right after Segwit is out, we will all start having addresses that begin with 3 and we will (mostly unknowingly) sign our transactions twice (automatically done by our wallets storing multiple priv. keys).
The change will happen very quickly, especially for people who make frequent transactions who want the benefit of lower fees.  As an added incentive, if fee pressure mounts, the change is compelled by high fees.

Right now, you can pull out your phone wallet and buy something.  They can get that.  Then you can say here, download this wallet, and send them $5.  They will find it only mildly amusing, unless of course what you show them you are buying is drugs; in that case they will be mesmerized.
However, those who couldn't give a shit about drugs and hoes will not be interested until there is practical value in using Bitcoin.  Some will find practical value as a speculative safe-haven away from government, but most won't. However, some high-volume retailers are eventually going to figure out that they can save money by using Bitcoin (no chargebacks, no waiting for cash, no FEES, no bullshit) and they will decide to split those savings with customers.  When that happens, average Joe who lives from paycheck to paycheck will all of the sudden be interested when what you purchase saves them half of what they would pay in sales tax.
Smart retailers ARE going to figure this out.  Some already have when it comes to paying with cash or using their branded card.
Then, average Joe who wants to save money, but is afraid of holding risk might look to reduce that risk, enter Bitreserve, or something like it.  (A fine gateway)
Ultimately, Bitcoin is most valuable to merchants, but when they pass that value to customers, watch out.

Yes.  In high enough amounts it's probably a felony.  Felony crimes will have 4 components.  
There will be a mental component (culpability requirement/Mens rea).  This is where crimes begin-in the mind.  The actor would have either needed intent, knowledge, or recklessness (probably not negligence).
Then there must be an act.  It must be voluntary.
Then there must be a foreseeable causal effect.  Here there obviously was.
And, sometimes the effect must actually result.
The criminal statute in your state dealing with theft will not address more than these elements (I am assuming you live in the U.S.).
A prosecutor may find it tricky to articulate that Bitcoin is property (or a thing of value).  But with a few minutes thought, they will figure out the trick (not that hard).
The prosecutor's job then will be like all other theft cases.  They will persuade a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the thief was at least aware of the risk that they were stealing (probably knew or had intention).  Then that they did the act (type in the amount and address and click send).  That doing so was expected to actually worked to transfer the property.
If the evidence persuades the jury, then they will be found guilty.

Your conclusion is the reason it is important to stop any attack on Vertcoin.
If Vertcoin is ruined, thousands of others will use similar "reasoning" to draw the same conclusion.  But the truth is that sustainably attacking a $10 million coin is trivial and cheap compared to attacking a $20 Billion Bitcoin that Bitmain's entire existence depends upon.
It is relatively cheap to manipulate Vertcoin's market, and the incentive is there, because harming the perception of UASFs protects ASICBoost (worth 10x more than Vertcoin).  The same incentive is absent in Bitcoin; attacking Bitcoin will kill Bitmain.  And even then, they don't have the resources to do so successfully.
So while logically, breaking Vertcoin's BIP148 shouldn't harm Bitcoin's attempt, because people will draw your conclusion, attacking Vertcoin will harm Bitcoin's chance of attempting a UASF.  The cost is well worth it to Jihan.

Miners are only "trusted" with transaction selection, and that's only out of necessity.  Those unnecessary zero transaction blocks show they are not even trustworthy in that regard.
In every other way miners are expected to be selfish, and they usually are.  Bitcoin's decentralized design relies on selfish miners competing in an unwinnable arms race on a level playing field.
ASICBoost tilts the playing field to the advantage of one miner holding the patent.  It allows its users to provide "proof" for work they never performed.  A quantum breakthrough would be so bad, because it would do exactly the same thing.
Thankfully, there's an easy fix to re-level the playing field.

If fees have to rise to keep Bitcoin lightweight, then so be it.  Fees will have to fund the network eventually anyway.  The powers that be may as well go ahead and set proper expectations and prevent people from relying on a model that can't persist.
For Bitcoin to scale as a store of major value, we don't need many transactions.  For Bitcoin to be used for everyday payments we need more transactions than the current system will ever be able to provide and an attempt to make the current system do so will relegate Bitcoin to a regulated inflationary currency controlled by those who currently control legacy currencies.

You do realize that presently there are a handful of people who are lobbied to implement changes right?  That's governable.  That's bad.  It needs to be reversed, not exacerbated.
The idea behind Bitcoin--the decentralized e-cash--is that governance is practically impossible because it requires the consensus of too many people.
As soon as nodes are too costly to be ran by ordinary end users, they have to rely on others.  They can't even start mining without a pool.  All that's required to govern in that instance is control of a few pools and a few exchanges.  Any protocol changes can easily be made mandatory under threat of legal action (with guns).  This is how the world is governed.
Right now there are about 20 pools and maybe 30 exchanges to control.  If all at once they all make the same change then a fork has almost occurred.  You just need the nodes to as well.  And that's the problem--anyone can run a node.  Therefore anyone can mine, and they can even fork an algo change to cut off the others.  But once people can't run a node, then I'd estimate, assuming Bitcoin is adopted, that within a 15 year span Bitcoin will be controlled completely by governments (of some sort) as an ordinary course of business.
How do you co-opt Bitcoin?  Make it too costly/difficult for ordinary people to support the network.  This has already kindof happened with mining.  Once nodes are too costly, running on a pool is no longer an economic option, but a technical necessity.  Economics, of course, keep the number of relevant pools to about no more than 20.  If Bitcoin completes the loop and becomes fully adopted, this is all that is needed for control.  Until then you need the exchanges too.
That's my real view.  I think it's realistic too (not FUD).  What I'd most like to see implemented in Bitcoin (after the changes are in place necessary to make payment channel networks efficient/possible) is some sort of algo change to shift mining incentives to solo mining.  But I have no idea how or if this could be done.  If that were to happen, I think we'd actually be able to fulfill Satoshi's vision.

Yep.  That's what the hack does.  It allows them to perform less work, but give the "proof" as though they did.  And it's patented, creating an unlevel playing field.  Bitcoin's most delicate balance comes in keeping its proof of work requirement the same for all.  Bitmain is cheating and not performing all of their work.

As you kinda sorta said, the miners are mostly beholden to ROI.  So the actual market greatly influences what miners will do.  Most will do what they perceive the market wants (which is mine Bitcoins).
But they have never had to do much in depth analysis of what the market really wants; they just mine those Bitcoins.  In this case they are being lobbied and lead to believe that if they start mining something else, the market will continue to reward them.  But that's not something anyone can guarantee the miners.  The same group that lobbies the miners to change seems not to be persuasive to the market.  In this case there could easily be a misperception by the miners that the market wants new coin.  When they discover their error they will either switch back (or quit altogether as the market for both has been destroyed by confusion).

Bitmain is cheating! They are secretly using a covert method of forging "proof" for work they never actually performed.  They get paid well for the unperformed work.
Worse, they've patented their cheat, so nobody else can use it.  No one noticed, because they thought it could only be used overtly (i.e., in a noticeable way).
Even worse, this is the secret reason they have been hindering Bitcoin by waging a war on SegWit. This is the reason they are okay with SegWit only as a risky hard fork (it would allow them to continue to cheat).
It appears that they even planted the whole idea for the complicated EXTBLK idea and got the purse guys to develop it.  They had them design in a way that was SegWit incompatible when it could have easily been designed SegWit compatible.  Every bit of this, including the years-long war on SegWit is all about protecting the ability of Bitmain to secretly cheat by faking proof for work they never performed.

I don't think this is a "joke."  I think Wang Chun has no great way to save face in this situation, and this is the best he can do.  He wants to signal SegWit, but he doesn't want to make all of his "friends" hate him.  So he is signaling "everything" while knowing that SegWit is the only one that matters.  He wants to be able to give the impression that he's taking no sides by taking every side.
But again, he knows that the only side that matters at this point is SegWit.  Regardless, everyone knows he's running Core (with SegWit) in order to signal all of that stuff.

This will make it clear to you without too much work (just a little).
**Segwit IS a block size increase.**
How is this accomplished without a hard fork?  Well, It's a little trick that has to do with the way old nodes count the size of a transaction.
The transaction format is rearranged slightly:
Currently it is: version input1(utxo1, witness1), input2(...), input3(...), outputs..., locktime
With segwit it becomes: version utxo1 utxo2... outputs... witness1 witness2... locktime
**Understand this:**
Because it was never envisioned that witness data could be moved, the measure of a transaction's size is counted up to the end of the outputs.  By moving the witness data after the outputs, old nodes do not count the witness data in the measurement of the transaction size, but the witness data is still very much a part of the blocks.   **That's what creates the actual block size increase.**  It's not data trimming.  It's simply manipulating the old nodes to not count the witness data, *because it comes after the outputs under segwit.*
The block size is still transaction data + witness data, but under segwit, the function that measures transaction size is only counting the transaction data that ends with outputs and it doesn't count the witness data, although it is still very much a part of the transaction.  Therefore under segwit, the transaction data is limited to 1 MB, but the witness data (for old nodes) is not limited at all.  Under new nodes, however, the witness data is limited under the new block weighting system.

If they happen to succeed, I wouldn't be unhappy if Core then implemented 2MB + Segwit without the increase, as you suggest could be done.
However, it seems that it may be preferable to do as you suggest and implement an algo change in Core.  It might be the one chance to fix the mining centralization problem that would have (assuming a HF is imposed) lead to a forced change in the protocol.

These payment channels aren't even routed.  It's just two guys with a uni-directional payment channel (a function that's been around for years), where one pays and one receives.
It has a function, but LN is about connecting and then routing payments through these type channels (except bi-directional) in order to reach people anywhere so long as there is a link.  It could take multiple hops (like TCP/IP) routing, but will be very fast.

I've read that post, and I cannot reconcile the specific method with the general vision in the whitepaper to have Bitcoin be decentralized.  They are mutually exclusive in the face of regulatory ability.
Moreover, that specific method involved reliance upon Moore's law, which has failed him miserably to date.
In all intellectual honesty, I can't make myself believe that Satoshi set out to create a system that required datacenters to run.  I believe he set out to create a decentralized currency.  By the time he was making statements about datacenters, I surmise that he was grasping for ways it could possibly scale--datacenters are the least imaginative and least elegant, but certainly better than a prayer.  Still, I can't help but believe that he was open to (actively hoping and searching for) better means.  He even had the foresight to put in payment channels (from version 0.1), and I suspect this was in hopes of creating a better way.
In a supposed email to Hearn, he said he had ideas for how Bitcoin could scale to levels that are completely impossible even with datacenters.  Unfortunately, Mike did not ask about that method.
TL;DR. I know Satoshi envisioned decentralized.  I suspect datacenters was a compromise to be quickly disposed of in the face of better alternatives--certainly not essential to the Vision.

However, who has standing to challenge a violation of the 4th if they are never aware of a particular infringement?  See Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA (2013).

Words have meanings--often multiple meanings--and I am right.
But let's play with you Asperger inclinations.
Bitcoin was designed to be change resistant (not immutable).  You say that if it can be changed then it is not immutable.  Yet your camp has given it your best go and have not been able to change Bitcoin.  How can you say it is not immutable if you cannot change it?  Is that only because in theory it can be changed, but not in practice?  But if it cannot be changed in practice does that not make it immutable--it's not able to be changed?

I may very well underestimate the push.  My estimation is that there are relatively few who are attempting to harm Bitcoin, and more who are passionately, but mistakenly following their lead.  However, the followers, mostly wish success for Bitcoin.  These people, seemingly unanimously, agree that privacy and fungibility are essential to Bitcoin.  I recall Hearn being harshly criticized in 2013 at the hint of supporting blacklists.  The support he received might suggest people do not care about blacklists, but I have always attributed is backing for XT to be the result of short memories and the individual application of the policy that the enemy of my enemy is my friend.  To start a reddit shitshow, all one needs to do is suggest blacklisting.
Accordingly, I think if the debate were shifted from SW vs. 2mb HF to CT via SW vs. 2mb HF, CT would become the pitchfork that separates the wheat from the chaff.  Those who oppose CT would likely be identified by their followers as being anti-Bitcoin.  Privacy is a matter that has unwavering support.
While CT is not best implemented by a SF, if you find it to be adequate if implemented by a SF, it may be wise to make it part of the roadmap.  Those who are covertly against Bitcoin and CT will have a difficult time keeping support without also providing a plan for CT.

On the bacteria thing, just a quick question.  Is that an example of a particular life form developing a trait and the passing it on to its progeny, or is it an example of a few members of a class having qualities that others within the class don't, and then those qualities allow it to survive while the others die off?
I mean this as a serious question, because while I don't really give a shit I am curious over the matter, and I have been convinced that we don't have observable examples of the development of a new trait, an observation that seems key for the "evolutionist" to prove her point.  Another key would be the observation of life forming from non-life, of which I also have been convinced is not observable.

You say it’s a problem.  But it’s not a problem that will hinder adoption.  In fact, the very thing that might be a “problem” for society will be viewed as a feature by the individual, actually hastening adoption despite even widespread belief that Bitcoin is bad for society.
Educating people to this “problem” will be as ineffective to prevent adoption as education is in preventing other tragedies of the commons.  In fact, education people about the “problem” will likely hasten the problem.  This is so because the real solution is for the individual to make sure they own Bitcoin so that they won’t be left out when society adopts.
Otherwise, I’m not worried about trying to fix deflation.  I’ve already solved my problem; I own Bitcoin.

Don’t know of a way.  Once there is complete adoption/saturation, there should be little or no deflationary ramifications.  But until that point there will be deflation-like changes in purchasing power.
One could (and many do) argue that this deflation is bad for the economy.  But few can argue that the individual (without consideration of the whole) would be better off if he/she held an inflationary currency over a deflationary currency.  Every individual is incentivized to choose to hold money that increases in purchasing power rather than decreases.  So even if Bitcoin were bad for society, the individuals that make up society will choose it regardless.  It would be a typical tragedy of the commons.
Of course, I’m not at all persuaded that a deflationary currency would wreak the havoc that is often speculated.

Don’t get me wrong.  Bitcoin is better off if it is capable of quickly (instantly) handling thousands of transactions per second.

And even if Bitcoin is unable to scale in transactions, it still has the potential to disrupt the financial system simply by its present ability to scale in terms of wealth storage, which is currently unlimited.

There is always a balancing between freedom and security.  Perfect security will completely nullify freedom.  Some might ask what is the point of security without freedom.  Hence the notion behind "[g]ive me liberty, or give me death."
With that as a guiding principle, we, the people, in order to secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity, have codified and adhered ourselves to a written Constitution.  We demand our elected officials take oath to abide in our Constitution.  When, in the most justifiable notion of security, those officials tread on that Constitution it is an affront to the very liberty they claim to be protecting.  In order to protect us from one tyrant another, more dangerous, is then created.  As C.S. Lewis put it, "[o]f all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive."  
Whether you share the same position is a personal matter, but surely your intellect will allow you to at least appreciate the opposing viewpoint.  After all, it is the opposing viewpoint that has lead to and maintained the freedom you wish to secure.  I hope no attrocity occurs, either through external means, or through internal oppresive subjectification.  But I'm not willing to give up my liberty simply to protect it.  Our officials must abide in their oaths while they exercise their limited and enumerated powers, temporarily granted, to secure the nation.

Bitcoin already has succeeded as being an online payment system.  It just hasn’t proven (yet) scalable.  But that’s fine.  It’s good enough to be used to store massive wealth and no other coin, no matter how “useful,” has shown the number one property that makes Bitcoin more useful as a store of wealth than any other coin—proven immutability.
With every other coin, hard forks are easily accomplished and are common place.  But hard forks within Bitcoin have been proven impossible, no matter how benign-seeming.  This fact (coupled with Bitcoin’s good-enough transaction network) is the reason will become the primary means of storing wealth before any other so-called decentralized currency.  Big money wants proven immutability before they are willing to entrust their wealth.  And... Big money isn’t concerned with cheap, instantaneous, scalable transactions.
With that said, the more transactions the better—to the extent that we can increase without compromising immutability.  And thankfully, the lightning network is steadily growing.  We now have the best of both worlds, which certainly adds even more value.


To the contrary, it’s your thinking that is naive.  There are plenty of “veterans” around here who fought a years-long PR battle to prevent people with your exact line of thinking from screwing up Bitcoin.  We eventually won and the losers became BCash, which has lost almost half its value since existing while Bitcoin is up by more than twice its value in the same timeframe.  They thought that by increasing Bitcoin’s functionality through a hard-forked transaction-capacity increase that they would increase the market value through added functionality.  They were wrong.  They added more “functionality,” but they lost, and are still losing, value, because they proved BCash easily hard-forked.  Unwittingly, they also proved that it is practically impossible to kill the real Bitcoin or remove its consensus rules.  Thus, Bitcoin’s use as a store of wealth has greatly increased and will continue to do so with, of course, the wild price fluctuations that we will see until the market is much more saturated.

I don't buy this perspective.  The vast majority of people are rightfully reluctant to send their hard earned money to some exchange that is unregulated.  2014 even until now shows a string of major thefts related to entities that are supposed to hold your Bitcoin for you.  It is more reasonable that people fear unregulated entities far more than regulated entities--Especially if there is oversight by an authority that ultimately can lock violators in a cage for violating regs.  
While uncertainty about legality will always add risk, thereby lowering MV, the alternatives are to either have a government with no teeth to provide retribution for wrongdoing, or to have enforceable regulations.  Both provide certainty of legality, but only the latter helps remove uncertainty regarding trust of an entity that requires trust in order to use their services.  The former actually invites deceit.  (See Bitcoin's short history.)
Until someone creates workable entities that require no trust, I suggest acknowledging that we do not live in some decentralized utopia, thus even less than perfect regulations, in the eyes of most, are better than no regulations, provided they are not overly oppressive, or drafted, executed, and administered under pretense.
Regulations, not only remove uncertainty of illegality, but they also remove uncertainty of recourse.  On the other hand, no regulations welcomes theft and provides no recourse.  How is it better for the price of Bitcoin if the government simply legislated: "Bitcoin is legal, but we are not watching any centrally trusted entities to add protection from wrongdoing?"

As soon as Bitcoin becomes “legal tender” for a recognized foreign country, it totally changes the taxation possibilities for U.S. citizens.  In that case, Bitcoin can be a “functional currency” under 26 U.S.C. § 985 (Internal Revenue Code).  In such a case, traders can keep up with gains with Bitcoin as the base currency rather than USD, drastically simplifying tax records keeping and likely reducing tax implications for altcoin/tether traders.
Is this the case?  I doubt it.  But U.S. traders (the ones that actually report) should keep an eye on this or check into it with their tax professional.

I assume you mean the price of 1 oz. of gold.  There are estimated to be 5.8 billion ozs of gold in circulation.  This would represent the equivalence of about $350k per ounce if there were only 21 million ozs in existence, but maintained the same market cap.  So if Bitcoin could gain only three times the market saturation of gold as a store of value then it could be valued at $1mm per Bitcoin.  I'd say that's not implausible.  After all, gold is not that popular as a store of value.

I remember like two years ago when people were worried about this.  That was when everyone was certain the government was just looking for anyway possible to come after Bitcoin.  The suggestion always seemed a little out there--there really is no guilty mind for the blockchain download--but now it just seems absurd.  There is no justification for retribution and there is no utilitarian reason for punishing the "crime."  Thus the courts would have a hard time punishing what is a clearly a pretextual charge.  My guess is most wouldn't.
The proper way to attack Bitcoin in the U.S. would be under the exclusive Congressional authority to create money.  Make it illegal to conduct business in Bitcoin.  Shut down exchanges,  wires to exchanges, and Bitpay.  Bitcoin would have to eek by, barely surviving underground.  It would lack the sufficient intermediary services that are bridging the gap between obscurity and wide acceptance.  Courts would enforce this.
@_date: 2015-04-03 14:26:36
Ours is a system that carries a burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  This burden exists because our system acknowleges that there is rarely, if ever, knowledge with certainty.  And given that we can't usually know guilt with certainty (like in this case), there will be times when we convict innocent people.  This is a travesty that our system is designed to minimize.  As such, conviction requires overcoming all reasonable doubt.
There is a figurative balancing scale within the mind of jurors.  All evidence may carry some weight in shifting that scale.  Whether Ulbricht did the crime or not is not question posed to a jury, as they are not equipped with omniscience.  The question posed is whether a reasonable person would have reasonable doubt of his guilt, a question they are equipped to answer--assuming the evidence is fairly presented.  
It may not be fair to withhold evidence that would reasonably establish doubt.  It may be especially unfair to allow some evidence to be presented in a way to weigh on the seriousness of the crime, while excluding the circumstances surrounding that evidence from establishing doubt.
When investigators have criminally tampered with evidence there is doubt cast over the entirety of an investigation.  Even if it appears they did not tamper with the damming evidence, it now comes into the realm of plausibility that they might have.  As such, whether that doubt is reasonable should be weighed by a jury, especially when the doubt was caused by a person acting under color of the same government now wishing to punish.
You and I can't know whether Ulbricht is guilty.  We, like others of sound mind, can, however, determine whether it is reasonable to have reasonable doubt of his guilt.  In order to do this we need a fair presentation of the relevant evidence.  This is the role of the jurors, who are as qualified as the two of us.  However, they can only weigh the evidence presented.  I would like to know whether doubt is reasonable considering the evidence withheld.  I'll trust a well-informed jury for that determination.

You are half correct.  Scalability is an issue, but there is also a consideration of decentralization.  This method could come at a huge cost to decentralization.  We all know what that results in.  
Prior to the Lightning Network, it was practically a foregone conclusion that the only way to scale Bitcoin is to increase the Block cap.  However, developers were reluctant to do so because of the cost to decentralization.  Because of the introduction of the LN, it may prove unnecessary to increase the block cap.  Moreover, it may actually preempt implementation of the LN, which promises to be a far more elegant scaling solution.

That's because you have no proper grasp of proportions.  As a parent, I (and you should too) have far more problem with one of yours or my daughters being kidnapped and enslaved and then knowingly sold for sex by Carl Ferrer than with some unimportant nuance over the semantics of a common term like underage children.  As a lawyer who makes a damn good living making proper use of words (since we're pulling rank), I find nothing strange about the term "underage children," despite its redundancy.  If I were to use the term ad nauseum in a brief, even the most uptight word-smith judge would have no problem with it--it's common.  But I'll leave it to some dumbass redditor father (or mother) to take issue with the redundancy in a stupid-ass attempt to defend someone who willfully sells children just like their own into a life of some of the most horrific abuse.  You should read the filed complaints of some of the victims of Backpage.

You dumbass.  I am the guy who trolls antagonizing all the Hearn supporters.  They are the ones running around saying that miners don't matter (like you).  Yet, they are doing everything they can to persuade miners (go figure).
Without miners, the can't implement what they want.  As such, they can't even take their 13% node support and create their own version.  You know why?  Because no one will mine it.  Their coin doesn't exist without enough miners to secure it.  Likewise, if miners choose  another route, the coin you wish to run will no longer exist. Even if you managed to garner a few miners, someone would attack the network.  In the scenario where miners form consensus to fork the code, and then do so, you are fucked if you don't as well.  However, if there is a large amount of users that refuse to switch, in spite of miner change (major selloff), then miners are fucked as well.  So the threat of mutually assured destruction may prevent miners from forking the code.  
But... There is no agreement among users not to go with miners; there are too many users to pull that off anyway.  In fact, there are many users that support BIP100.  As such, it should be clear to the major pools that if they switch, then they will have some users, but the other users won't have miners.  Clearly then, all of those minerless users, with the exception of a few diehard ideologues, will switch too.  The users don't have governance to successfully pull off a strategy of mutually assured destruction.
Nonetheless, simply forking is risky to miners, so they will work to build consensus.  But make no mistake, they are centralized enough to make the tail wag the dog.

To really obscure the matter, it's not even text and images, it's really just a series of ones and zeros.  Not even that really, it's just electromagnetic impulses.  How can that possibly be wrong?
As it turns out, the ones and zeros, which represent text and images, happen to represent text and images that represents content and messages.  Often those messages are "pay me and I'll let you rape this child."  Backpage takes an active roll in developing these messages in a manner that removes the explication from what is implied.  They remove all identifying features from any content posted and they take a fee for doing so.  They don't just allow people to post messages.  They've designed their service in such a way as to help pimps by developing their ads to sell underage children (yes, a redundant term) and remain anonymous.  Backpage does this for fees.  This makes Backpage a pimp and a conspirator to pimp.  What's worse is that pimping is part of their business mission.  The "new, sweet, flowers" they sell often have no choice in the matter when they are ravaged.  The text and images they help develop is posted for the sole purpose of profiting from the rape of underage children.  Justice would subject Carl Ferrer to years and years of the same sort of ravaging (prison rape) that he has willfully subjected innocent children to.

It takes one really dull wit to be unable to find distinctions between two different things.  I can almost always distinguish even between two very similar things.  You, on the other hand, can't distinguish even between two very different things (or you choose to equivocate).  BP knowingly and intentionally takes an active roll in helping people sell unwilling underage children for sex.  It's not something that happens occasionally against their wishes.  They go out of their way to help edit "ads" to do so in a manner least likely to inculpate the pimp while still attempting to maintain an appearance of plausible deniability.  Their internal discussions uncovered in discovery actually indicate their intent to help exploit these children in order to make a buck.
Sec. 230 of the CDA was inserted to prevent the odd result where prodigy was found liable for defamation because it tried to remove defamatory content, thereby making it an editor, but Lycos was found not liable because they made no such attempt.  Backpage is doing the opposite.  They help develop ads aimed at breaking the law in order to make the ads more effective.  They are culpable and should be found outside the scope of immunity.  Regardless, they are within the reach of criminal liability.  I hope they suffer the same ravaging in prison that the willfully imposed on others in their endeavor for lucre.

Oh.  Well unfortunately that's what the trials will be about.  As of a few weeks ago SCOTUS docketed for cert. hearing a civil appeal out of the 1st Cir. where Backpage was shielded under 230.

Section 230 may give civil immunity, but not criminal immunity in most jurisdictions.  Moreover, the immunity provision protects interactive computer services, but not information content providers.  An entity can be both. And a strong case can be made that Backpage does enough development of the ads to also be a content provider under 230(f)(3)'s definition of a content provider.  Regardless of the immunity provision, there is no doubt that Backpage tailors their service to cater to pimps selling underage children.  In civil cases Backpage has been lucky in Massachusetts District Court (being heard by the 1st Circuit) to be shielded by the overbroad interpretation of the immunity provision even against plaintiffs raped 1,000's of times.  Good fucking luck in a well-deserved criminal case.  Backpage is a crooked business of the most heinous type and its operators are absolutely culpable.  I say this as someone is usually pro-EFF and always pro encryption, etc.  I, however, am never pro-child sex trafficking, which is a particular goal of Backpage.

Each block in the chain must also conform to the consensus rules that were enforced when forming the previous block.
Although Voorhees has moved in the right direction, this seems like just another attempt to leave the door open to later redefine Bitcoin.  Under Voorhees’s asserted definition, all that Bcash lacked to be Bitcoin is more hash power.  The result is absurd.  In Voorhees’s world, one moment Bitcoin could be Bitcoin, then the next (with a shift in hash power) BCash could be Bitcoin, then with a shift back, Bitcoin is Bitcoin again.  Then this could be applied to Bitcoin Gold, Diamond, etc. such that at any moment, any number of forked alts could be the ever-changing “real” Bitcoin.

What a lack of understanding.  Central banks are (supposedly) formed to protect economies by taking measures that put a currency at risk.  They protect economies by adjusting supply of the currency.  But adjusting the supply of a currency puts the currency in jeopardy.  Sometimes protecting the economy can amount to adjusting supply to keep a stable value to the currency.  If central banks cannot adjust supply, then the argument goes that the economy could face additional trouble.  However, even under the scenario of economic trouble, a fixed supply currency can remain strong (probably stronger) than one that has the supply tampered with.  Accordingly, even if their premise was true (that we need controlled currencies to protect economies), all that means is that a Bitcoin fueled economy is a less stable, but that does not mean that the currency itself is less stable.
Given the choice between a mature fixed supply currency or a variable supply currency--that can be artificially devalued--the reasonable person acting in their own best interest will choose to store wealth where it cannot be tampered with.  This is true even where that person may believe that society is better off if everyone chooses to use a currency controlled by a central bank.  In other words, a "tragedy of the commons" type situation develops where the individual's best interest is in conflict with the best interest of the whole.  Accordingly the whole adopts what is in the best interest of the individual.  That means Bitcoin can prevail notwithstanding a widely held belief that it should not.
To be clear, I do not believe that a fixed supply currency is bad for an economy.  My only point is to assert that even if it were, adoption is still likely.

I imagine the operators of Backpage would feel the same if they weren't profiting from selling children.  Their arrest caused me to follow up on some research I did last year.  I am pleased to learn that in the last few weeks SCOTUS docketed for certiorari hearing in a civil appeal from the 1st Cir. where immunity was granted to Backpage where three underage petitioners (Jane Does) complain that Backpage intentionally sold them into the sex trade.  Hopefully we will finally see Sec. 230 properly construed to quit allowing Backpage operators to hide behind their insanely thin veil of feigned propriety.

There hasn't even been a prosecutor announced.  There has, however, been numerous civil plaintiffs lawyers who have brought causes against them in an attempt to overcome the significant hurdle that is Sec. 230.  And the U.S. Supreme Court has docketed certiorari hearings that will finally settle that matter (here's a hint: they usually do that only when they are about to reverse).  Soon enough, therefore, there WILL be prosecutors and plaintiffs lawyers and attorneys general all acting in tandem and with great veracity, but still only enough to punish the Backpage operators in slight compared to the ravaging suffered by those children the Backpage operators sold into the sex trade.

A Satoshi is .00000001.  By changing the definition, you are just being difficult.  At this point you are grasping for straws.


In a tragedy of the commons if one individual could stop the destruction by their own actions, then it would not be in their interest to act against the whole.  For instance, if there are entities with large interests in Bitcoin, that entity alone could find mining, and if large enough, it would be in its best interest to fund mining even if no one else would.  In reality, because multiple entities will exist like this, ordinary users will always be in fee competition to get their transactions confirmed.

If you would just qualify your statement a little it would not be so ridiculed.
Try this.
Don't do that.  While Satoshi Dice may have initially had pure motives (this is a distinction between integration and attack), their form of integration produces results similar to an attack.  All of those unnecessary transactions are, for practical purposes, no different than the so-called "stress tests" implemented by CoinWallet.eu.
The statement above (modified as you may like) conveys the message you intended.  And while it may attract some argument, it does not come across as unreasonably extreme.
The word "attack," in its colloquial meaning, carries with it a certain *mens rea* (guilty mind).  It is not only a results based definition.  You already know this, even if not on an intellectual level, which is why you chose the word "attack"--to make the act seem more egregious.  This is what people rightfully are making fun of.  The guy wanting to make a game does not have the requisite intent to be labeled an attacker.
Your statement is absurd because of its extreme nature.  However, slight qualification through the use of words of degree (rather than words of affirmative absolute) would make your statement reasonable and palatable even to those who may disagree.  Also, it makes your statement hard to disagree with.  After all, the results are very much like the results produced by a genuine attack.

Well... We need miners... I don't want to store a lot of value in a coin that doesn't have them.  So, suppose one of them decides to fork the code and implement BIP100, and then persuade others to run it.  If they then raise the cap and my node rejects their blocks, that would suc.  I would pretty much, accordingly, have to switch my node too.  So... I guess any reasonable Bitcoin holder cares what miners think about this.

Hence the ensuing public criminal trial.  This one is occurring because of the repeated claims on the record in almost every circuit for civil causes that have either been settled or barred from recovery under precedence of an overly broad interpretation of the poorly drafted "good samaraitan" provision within Sec. 230 of the CDA.

@_date: 2016-10-07 14:54:26
J.S. v. Vill. Voice Media Holdings, 184 Wash.2d 95 (Wash. 2015).
Case got settled after Backpage lost their motion (appealed all the way to the Washington high court) to dismiss for failure to state a claim.  Backpage has often been able to bar plaintiffs from recovering against them (in this case the plaintiffs claim 1000's of rapes) because the "Good Samaritan" provision within Sec. 230 of the Communications Decency Act was poorly drafted and subsequent interpretations involving mostly defamation claims gave such liberal construction as to provide immunity even in the most extreme cases of willful abuse--for Civil claims, not criminal.
The provision was added after a strange result where Prodigy was held responsible in a defamation claim because the court found them to be like a newspaper due to their attempts to edit the content posted on their servers in order to remove defamatory remarks.  Lycos, on the other hand, made no such attempts and, ironically, was therefore not found responsible.  The result is that one who tries to prevent wrongdoing is punished and one who does nothing is held blameless.  So the "Contract with America" bunch lead by Newt Gingrich added a "Good Samaritan" provision to their otherwise porn-hating bill (the Communications Decency Act, which has subsequently been held void in many sections for violating the First Amendment) in order to prevent the unsavory result of punishing Good Samaritans.
In order to achieve their result they distinguished "Interactive Computer Services" from "Information Content Providers" and held ICSs immune from publications by ICPs on their services.  The idea was to promote self-policing, so that Prodigy could remove defamatory without suffering liability.  The result, however, after overbroad interpretations is that ICSs who promote wrongdoing are immune.  The breadth and scope of the immunity varies from jurisdiction.  Worsening the problem are the heightened pleading standards outlined in Twombly and Iqbal (I'll spare you the discussion, but you can google the cases). Most jurisdictions are now seeking ways to reduce the scope to cover ICSs with scienter.
When it comes to Backpage, some jurisdictions (see, e.g., the State of Washington above) are finding a way around the immunity provision because Backpage is not merely an ICS, but they are also a Content Provider because of their efforts in  "development" of the ads to sell children for sex.  (Development is part of content provision under 230(f)).  This logic is based on a 9th Cir. ruling that found a housing website in violation of the FHA for aiding in discrimination attempts by the way it allowed querying real estate available.  The website operator became both an ICS and an ICP, which is not immune.
So back to your question, source?
In the jurisdictions where Backpage is unable to win a 12(b)(6) motion (or state equivalent) for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted due to the "Good Samaritan" provision, they settle.  In the court of public opinion, that is usually pretty damning circumstances.  However, in this subreddit, these types of sources are only persuasive if they are somehow pro bad guy--they would then be elevated to gospel status.  For you guys, even the criminal convictions of Backpage principals that will most definitely follow will not be persuasive.  You'll rely on some crackpot theory demanding far less of your "source" to conclude the government was somehow oppressive when imprisoning three guys who took lots of money to help people sell underage children into years of sexual torment.

Quote from the creator of Bitcoin:
"As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties: - boring grey in colour - not a good conductor of electricity - not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either - not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose and one special, magical property: - can be transported over a communications channel If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it. Maybe it could get an initial value circularly as you've suggested, by people foreseeing its potential usefulness for exchange. (I would definitely want some) Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it. I think the traditional qualifications for money were written with the assumption that there are so many competing objects in the world that are scarce, an object with the automatic bootstrap of intrinsic value will surely win out over those without intrinsic value. But if there were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as money, only scarce but no intrinsic value, I think people would still take up something. (I'm using the word scarce here to only mean limited potential supply)"

I have no idea what you are talking about (and question whether you do).  If there is a minimum fee that miners will accept and there are unlimited allowed transactions, then the more transactions, the greater the total fee reward--it never goes down by increasing number of transactions.

I guess that would work (depending on what it says).  However, when I think of an anti-dilution clause, I think of a clause that gives you a preferential right on new offerings (meaning the equity owner would have to purchase its pro rata interest to prevent dilution).  But I guess a clause that provides for mandatory distribution of a percentage of future offerings is also an anti-dilution clause.

Your conclusion is that fee pressure is required.  However, you use fee pressure as part of your premise here.  I'm saying that your conclusion is wrong, that without fee pressure increased transactions can increase total reward to a point that Bitcoin is sustainable.  There should be no reason for you to consider fee pressure in your calculation to show I am wrong.

Aren't there two ways to increase total fee reward: increase transaction fee and increase transactions?
If so, Bitcoin could be scaled by keeping fees low and increasing number of transactions.  
I personally think there are possibly far better ways to scale than simply allowing for more transactions, and these would require a fee pressure.  But I don't want to not acknowledge the obvious method of increasing allowed transactions--even if it is clumsy.

Define epsilon.
I am going to assume you mean immediate.  If so, I don't arrive at your conclusion.  There are costs to mining (equipment, electricity, effort, and bandwidth) those costs must be projected to be covered plus a premium for risk or else a miner would not mine.  Accordingly, the miners with lowest cost will set the fee that wallets will discover must be paid in order to likely be included.  Thus, the fee would not be one Satoshi unless projected transactions were expected to be astronomical.


Fee pressure is provided by the cost of mining.  What I disagree with/question is whether a cap is necessary to create the fee pressure requisite to funding miners (I think natural costs are enough). 


Convince me Otherwise.  I'm open-minded.  And please keep in mind that I want to keep the cap low.  I am only vetting ideas with you.  I love learning something new, but it seems that you are missing something.

What are you talking about?  The locked Bitcoin never leaves the chain, and it is up to either user to decide whether to unlock it (similar to a 2 of 3 multi-sig).


It's only conceptually a transference.  In reality, it's simply locking the Bitcoin in place on the main chain at the will of either party.  Once it's locked, there is no reason another system (in actuality wholly separate system) cannot treat that Bitcoin as a token in its system, so long as that system is designed in such a way to remove that token from its system once it becomes unlocked on the main chain.  None of this affects the security of the main chain (even if the sidechain is poorly designed).  Accordingly, so long as the user can redeem on the main chain at will, the side chain does not have to be as secure.


This is your conclusion, and it's false.  The in between is a sidechain.  A sidechain can be exactly as secure as any altcoin (or Bitcoin itself), but the tokens are Bitcoins pegged on the main chain.  But of course, the sidechain can work without a proof of work system, so long as the users have the ability to at-will go back to the main chain if ever they have a disagreement.


I don't know anything about this.


You are talking about securing a chain that may not even require a proof of work system.  Proof of work forces honesty, but if people always have the ability to go back to the main chain, that provides complete relief in the place of dishonest behavior.  There may be no need for proof of work at all (which is why you could have 10,000's of transactions per second).  Notice, the lightning network does not require miners.  


That's a very dramatic way of describing the preventable problem of losing hash power due to lack of mining reward.
Many different solutions (I am kindof joking with that, but you did not say anything here).

You seem like you have an agenda to discredit the idea of sidechains (which already of working implementations) regardless of merit.

The irony of this "academic" article is that it implicitly premises its conclusions on the fact that money had intrinsic value when it was backed by precious metals.  Yet it does not understand that even the value associated to precious metals is somewhat "metaphysical."
The article presupposes that precious metals are intrinsically valuable.  But a true academic article should understand the elemental nature of the value behind precious metals.
Precious metals only have value for two reasons.  They are scarce, and they have utility.  The primary value driving utility though is not in their usages as metals, but in their utility as a currency.  The factors that determine utility as a currency include fungibility, divisibility, scarcity, indestructibility, portability, transferability, and others.  When these factors exist all that is required is adoption.
Bitcoin needs a little work in transferability, but apart from that and assuming internet connectivity, bitcoin does money better than any other currency to ever exist.  It simply needs wide adoption and a means of mass transactions.  However, even without mass transactions, it is still relatively good at transferability and makes a great store of value.

Does fungible mean exactly the same or treated as the same?  I am suggesting the latter.
What I mean is that in practice, all Bitcoin's are treated the same.  Therefore they are fungible.  This is the same for most "fungible" assets.  Certain pork bellies come from farmers who could be blacklisted, but until they are, they are fungible.  Diamonds ("blood diamonds") are an example of an asset that loses its fungibility.  My point is that just because an asset could theoretically lose fungibility does not mean that it is not fungible.  My ultimate point is that it only takes a few mechanisms to frustrate the purpose of those who might wish to blacklist coins that have been used for illicit activities, and thereby maintain Bitcoin's fungibility.
But before I can make my point I have to make the point that traceability does not equate to infungibility in a practical world (it only sometimes leads to it).

If BIP101 were implemented, in time it could lead to a scenario where Bitcoin was controlled by a few, and would have the ability to be unfrozen.  Immutability (of the protocol and of the chain) is my feature.  I'm cool with one more fork to give some breathing room for transactions if it also includes changed to make way for the vertical and horizontal growth.  After that I want to see it frozen through decentralization amongst a large group with differing interests.

Forget LN.  At a certain point more transactions means no decentralization.  It's a limitation imposed by reality.  You can demand all you want, but Bitcoin cannot handle potential world demand payments and remain decentralized.  Accordingly, users will have to either pay fees or use something else (or Bitcoin loses the one thing that makes it better).

I think a lot of people are missing the big picture strategy when it comes to all of this.  Most people want to see confidential transactions, zero conf, scalability, etc. in the main chain.  But I don't think that is what is being planned by the visionaries (wisely).  I think what is being planned is a layered system.  At the base will be Bitcoin in its current state (maybe minor changes).  Do not forget that there is some value for having completely traceable transactions (this is the primary value for all uses of Bitcoin other than as cash--stock transfers, etc.)
Bitcoin in its current state has a built in payment network, but it is not great for widespread usage.  It is not up to Visa-level usage, but it is censorship-resistant and it has the first-mover advantage.  Attempting to add Visa-level capability to the bas protocol will jeopardize its censorship-resistant nature.  But there are mechanisms where two parties can agree to “lock” coins into place until one of them no longer wishes to have the coins locked on the main chain.  Once these coins are locked, they can then essentially be used in another system (so long as they remain locked).  This is the essence of **sidechains**.
So in order to add scalability, the idea is to develop sidechains that don't have the limitations of the main Bitcoin protocol.  Confidential Transactions will be implemented in a sidechain payment network implementation.  Presently confidential transactions are implemented in the experimental “sidechain elements,” but would require a fork to implement in the main chain (likely unnecessary to protect fungibility).  The very interesting development involving the use of a locking mechanism is the ability for two parties who have agreed to lock their coins on the main chain to transact with others who have done the same, without unlocking their coins.  This is the big idea behind the sidechain a paper (and also the Lightning Network kindof, but through payment channels).  If the payment network portion of Bitcoin were developed in this manner, confidential transactions could certainly be a part of that.  People who are using Bitcoin to conduct transactions could have their coins “locked” on the main chain indefinitely (always with the option of unlocking if there was a disagreement with the other party).  Their finances could remain private.  
This could allow for the best of both worlds where Bitcoin works as the primary settlement layer (the court in case of disagreement).  But most of the usage would work in side chains--payments with Confidential Transactions and stock transfers without.  Through a sidechain (locking your coins until you no longer want them locked), you could in essence move them into a system that has the best qualities of any alt-coin (Monero for instance).  Conceptually, this allows you to free bitcoin the token from the constraints of Bitcoin the settlement layer (previously they were always thought of as one).

While I am using hyperbole, I am still illustrating a truth that is uncomfortable to many here.  Bitcoin is designed in such a way that it cannot be forked by even a majority without substantial risk of breaking it unless there is practical consensus.  This is the feature that makes Bitcoin so valuable.  It is practically immutable, even as a protocol.  What makes it practically immutable is the difficulty (damn near impossibility) of obtaining consensus amongst a large group of people with differing/competing interests.
This guy makes a suggestion (a reasonable suggestion), 4 MB or whatnot.  Somebody else will make another reasonable suggestion (2MB).  Some will suggest infinite.  Some will suggest smaller.  Factions will form.  Even a relatively small minority can be enough to disrupt consensus.  Where there are factions, 1MB is the default winner (even if nobody wants that).  Division is the sole insurmountable foe to consensus.  While there is material division, Bitcoin is immutable.  It's one of the more brilliant features of Satoshi's creation.
The task here is not to get everyone to agree that blocks need to be increased; it is to get practically everyone to agree on **the exact manner**.  Good luck!

While that's true, here is my conjecture:

By immediate I meant "epsilon."


Funny.  I'm pretty sure that auto corrected from sunken cost.
Electricity, bandwidth, and effort are not sunk costs.  Equipment is (unless rented at-will), but still a factor when initially determining whether to mine.  Accordingly, the decision to set minimum fee factors more than propagation time (when there is no block reward).  A miner will determine whether to run the machine or not based on whether projected fees can provide a worthwhile risk premium to cover all projected costs (including electricity, effort, bandwidth, and probably others).  
Are you persuaded that your analysis is flawed, that epsilon propagation will not even theoretically result in 1Satoshi fees unless astronomical (i.e. unreasonably high) transaction volume is assumed?

First, I have not concluded that LN will be a workable scaling solution.  It does show promise, but until there is something closer to a working implementation I have not passed judgment.
To your point.  I think a lot of people do not understand the somewhat mutually exclusive nature of a large cap and a scaling solution such as LN; I certainly did not initially, and it took a bit of nuanced thinking to understand.  Here is the reasoning:
Bitcoin rewards miners through two methods, block reward and transaction fees.  Presently transaction fees are minimal and block reward is the predominant reward.  However, in the future that must change and transaction fees must increase or the network will be insecure.  There are two variables in total transaction fees: number of transactions and fee per transaction.  Accordingly, total transaction reward can be increased by increasing either number of transactions or fees per transaction (or both, etc.).  Under the cap increase method of scaling the idea is to increase the number of transactions while keeping fees low (obviously this would work, assuming number of transactions does in fact increase).  On the other hand, if the idea were to increase fees per transaction, increasing the number of allowed transactions preempts the fee increase by making transactions less scarce.  If LN is implemented and widely adopted, most transactions will not be on the blockchain, and accordingly, in time miners will not be rewarded unless fees per transactions are high, but if the cap is increased, fees will not be high.  Accordingly, under the scenario where both the LN is adopted and the cap is raised to keep fees low Bitcoin eventually becomes insecure.  Therefore, under this scenario the LN would simply likely not be a workable solution, thus never being adopted.  i.e. increasing the cap will likely preempt the LN (or some other scaling solution).  But if the LN is implemented with a lower cap, as Bitcoin scales in time, fees for settlements on the blockchain could increase and could be collected through aggregation of small fees on an off-chain or second-layer payment network.  This would actually provide long-term scaling solution to Bitcoin while maintaining its low-resource decentralized nature at the base protocol.
The question then becomes which way is better.  I don't know the answer to that.  I do know that if LN (or any other solution) acts as promised, keeping the cap low with a second-layer is far better (billions of trustless, instant, low-fee transactions that do not jeopardize the decentralized nature of Bitcoin the protocol).  However, until there is a working rendition I will not pass judgment.  So then the only question is: Is it urgent to implement a cap increase?  The answer is clearly no.  The stress tests have shown that, in spite of Gavin's call to "urgency" on May 4.  Accordingly, as we have the ability to increase the cap if it becomes urgent, I think it is better that we wait before choosing a clumsy (ten +- confirmations, heavy resource consumption, still highly limited, leads to less decentralization) approach to scaling that will likely preempt a potentially far more elegant approach that is presently in development (or any other that may be developed in the future).  When it truly does become urgent (fees are getting so high that usage is stifled) I will be for a small cap increase and possibly more.

The problem with the more direct method is that the IMF has measures in place to prevent it.  While the second method may not be optimal, it could be more effective than the former if the IMF has no means of protecting against it.  The dumping of a large portion of the currency on the market could lead to the further dumping, thus destroying all exchange rates.  Furthermore, as (if) Bitcoin becomes more widely used and accepted as a measure of relative value of fiat currencies the possibility of attack can become even more feasible.  Accordingly, it might be wise for the IMF to acquire.  My guess is that they can do so through means not considered in the law review article.  My guess also is that they are not interested.

In a criminal case, the elements of each crime charged will have to be shown once.  The hardest will be the culpability requirements--the guilty mind (I.e. Knowledge and intent).

There is no fine line between a hooker and a 15 year-old forced into the sex trade.

You want to regulate prostitution, a discussion that federalism demands should ordinarily remain within the province of the states.

I agree with all of your assertions in this comment.  Miners set minimum fees to cover marginal costs (or will when the reward is smaller).  Collecting more fees is always better.
Maybe I'm dense, but how does this require having a cap to create fee pressure?  If there were no cap, would not miners continue in this same manner--selecting their minimum fees (based on transaction projections) in a competitive market in order to cover projected costs plus a profit worth the risk?

This makes me very distrusting of you.  You are saying this so that we will accept at face value your torrent of attacks on Darkcoin, which I know very little about.  But the reason you have done that is because you are competing, not just some act of nobility.  You want the market.  When you claim otherwise, you are lying and are proven untrustworthy.  Now you may be fighting to deliver the best, but it is because you want the market.  Even if you buy your own bullshit, it's still bullshit.  Your better line is:
We're a fighting for relevance, marketcap, and cryptocurrency "investors". Thus, we're fighting to deliver the best tools and systems we can to ensure the ongoing safety of the funds our users have (in effect) entrusted to us.  Because of this, if nobody uses Monero that's annoying, and it will eventually prevent us from delivering a fantastic ecosystem. Monero is an experiment that we hope will be successful.  It's a race to show that we are the best.  Through our diligence and expertise we aim to win this ongoing competition to offer a more private alternative to Bitcoin.  We are most worthy of wearing the "cryptocurrency" badge.
This is a respectable statement.

Positive is not some discretionary determination.  It is bright line.  His post is positive and many of yours are negative.
Moreover, reddit voting is not necessarily a measure of relevance as you suggest, it is primarily a measure of popularity, which you have none.  A post can be unpopular for irrelevance, and popular although irrelevant, or unpopular and irrelevant.  Even relevant posts can be unpopular for different reasons.  Yesterday, posts just like his were voted high.  Today, older news, therefore maybe less popular.  Irrelevant posts don't just get downvoted though, if they are also unpopular, or hurtful to Bitcoin, they are to be removed by moderators, which you are not.  You are only a dipshit who prefers to go further in error than admit a wrong.  Stolen Bitcoins are relevant to Bitcoin.

No he's not, and you are gullible.  Gavin knows damn well that Wright is not Satoshi.  But to convince the gullible, he lies and says he believes "beyond a reasonable doubt."  
Gavin needs a Satoshi who sides with him.  Otherwise, he is quickly drifting into irrelevance.  And being the Bitcoin guy is all he has, it often lands him the best seat in the house and a cushy job that requires little actual work.

Bitcoin is unique.  Bitcoin required breakthroughs in thinking.  It's not comparable.
A limit is needed to protect decentralization.  Gavin can't disprove that point so he tries to circumvent the point by persuading with not-so-analogous analogies.
Gavin will try anything to win--he'll even back a fake Satoshi if fake Satoshi agrees with a cap increase.

Simply put.  Any change that adds more restriction can be soft forked.  This change adds a restriction.
Because it adds restrictions old versions won't reject blocks that comply, because the blocks still comply with the older less-restrictive nodes.  Accordingly, the change can be implemented slowly over time without causing disruption.
On the other hand, changes that remove restrictions will cause rejection of blocks by the old nodes.  Accordingly, these changes must have a supermajority (practical consensus) in agreement before implementation of the change, or else there will be major disruption.
@_date: 2016-05-04 03:19:51
Nope.  Gavin can quit lying and say, "after the forgery on the blog post, I question whether Wright is Satoshi."  Instead he doubles-down with the lies and says he believes "beyond a reasonable doubt."
@_date: 2016-05-06 18:31:30


To understand this you need to break down your “question” (really an assertion).  First, there must be a quick discussion on the meaning of “proof,” and Gavin’s intended method of proof.  Then, once “proof” is understood, there must be a discussion on motive.
Proof is a nuanced word.  In mathematics it means something entirely different than it does in matters regarding human affairs.  Mathematical proof is something far more concrete.  However, to prove that Wright is Satoshi is actually an matter that consists only of persuasion.  This is the nature of “legal proof.”  Had no one re-formatted the signature and discovered it on the block chain, Gavin and company would have proven (not in the mathematical sense) to lots of people that Wright is Satoshi.  Had days passed, before the forgery was discovered, lots of people would still be convinced that Wright is Satoshi (the whole bias from first impressions).  Indeed, some diehards are still convinced that Wright is Satoshi despite the damning forgery.  Notwithstanding your understanding of the word prove, Gavin could convince lots of people that Wright is Satoshi if no one quickly discovered the signature.  That’s risky, but it is not far-fetched.
The bitch of it is someone discovered the forgery within 90 minutes—well before the false impression had time to propagate.  And that’s when Gavin screwed up royally.  That’s when he “proved” to everyone that he is lying.
Right now, I’m going to detour on the way to motive to show **how anyone can know he is lying.**
To determine that he is lying, you don’t need to know what he supposedly saw, or what was said.  All you have to realize is that as soon as Gavin learned that the public signature was a forgery, if he truly believed prior (that Wright is Satoshi), then this revelation would have made him doubt—reasonably doubt. After all, the signature he supposedly verified was under extremely suspect circumstances (in a London hotel room chosen by Wright; on Wright’s computer; and with Wright retaining all of the “evidence”). After learning of the forgery, no reasonable person would think it unlikely they were tricked. But instead, Gavin lies and says he believes Wright is Satoshi “beyond a reasonable doubt.” TWICE!
Then Electrum (the company that authors the client software purportedly used for verification) confirmed that no .asc file was even downloaded from the U.K. on the day of the supposed “verification.” And after all this and even more time to deliberate, Gavin decides to bolster the fabrication via twitter. Gavin is lying. He knows damn well that Wright is not Satoshi. These are the actions of a desperate man.
**On to motive.**  This is where many are getting tripped up; it’s actually quite simple when you see it.
For some time now, Gavin has been drifting into irrelevance. And being the Bitcoin guy THE thing Gavin has to distinguish himself.  This distinction has, for the last several years, landed him the best seat in the house and a cushy job that requires little actual work. Those are surely in jeopardy if he can't pull off some miracle to make himself relevant again.  The XT fail was bad.  The Classic fail was worse.  Those failures make it clear that in time, Gavin will be completely irrelevant.
If Gavin wishes to salvage his relevance it will require something drastic.  Desperate times accordingly resulted in desperate measures.  If no one would have re-formatted the signature and searched it on the blockchain then Wright would have a lot of people believing he is Satoshi right now.  And Gavin would have a lot of people believing Satoshi whole-heartedly backs Gavin.  It’s fairly risky to hope no one will find that signature, but it’s not far-fetched that they will not.  It is definitely a “Hail Mary” type move, but Gavin has quite a bit at stake, and the agony of defeat is looming.
That is the motive.  And it perfectly and reasonably explains the behavior.  The real bitch of all of this is that it only took about 90 minutes for the fake signature to be determined a forgery.  That was not enough time for the hopeful belief that Wright is Satoshi to even propagate (people form strong biases around initial impressions).  Accordingly, before the idea could even take hold, it was debunked and Gavin was hastily forced to decide how to respond.
Had his decision simply been “Do I still believe Wright is Satoshi?” the answer would easily have been, “I have my doubts.”  But Gavin’s actual decision was “Should I stick with my story, or should I give up on regaining my relevance?”  That’s where he made the mistake.  He did not realize that sticking with his story was not a real option.  He did not realize that there was absolutely no way to still convince people.  In a hasty act of desperation he chose to stick with his lie.  Like so many acts of desperation, it has completely exposed his character.

Spending coin doesn't really do that much for Bitcoin at the moment.  That Bitcoin is "spendable" matters.  But the current aim should be to make Bitcoin widely used as a store of wealth, to make it a highly coveted asset class.  As that occurs, spending will naturally occur, as merchants/individuals will seek Bitcoin as a preferred form of payment.
Plan A should be to grow adoption as a store of value.  Of course, adoption as a medium of exchange can and should grow concomitantly.  But the world does not need a new Visa or Paypal.  The world needs a fully auditable money that is outside the purview of government.

So in an oversimplified view you have created a method of merging all exchanges into one instant decentralized exchange (I assume they don't have to trust one another).  Because of the instantaneous nature of the transactions, in its fullest implementation, if a user places funds on one exchange the user can instantly trade on any other member exchange.  Funds on one exchange, whether fiat or crypto, can be instantaneously transferred (traded) for funds on another.  Pretty slick if I understand it correctly.

First, welcome to Reddit.
Second, anyone with a brain already knows what didn't happen--the supposed "verification."
Gavin is lying about that to bolster his fabrication that Wright is Satoshi.  So, while not exactly, what generally happened is this.  Gavin and company made up a story to convince the world that they had found a Satoshi who just so happens to support his plan.  The plan was risky, but the times are desperate.  Had no one reformatted the signature and searched it on the blockchain (quite possible) then nobody would be the wiser.  That people uncovered their hoax in only 90 minutes panicked Gavin and caused him to desperately double-down "beyond a reasonable doubt" that Wright is Satoshi.  Part of this involved hastily making up some bullshit about a verification in London on Wright's computer.

The reason they won the debate is simple:  (1) A cap increase harms decentralization; (2) it is not necessary to scale; (3) it is not really ideal (slow confirmations still greatly limited); and (4) there are potentially better solutions that will be preempted by a premature block increase.

Beware of Bruce Fenton (or anyone) trying to make Bitcoin governable.  The most important thing that can happen to prolong Bitcoin's importance is to have mining pools broken down by shifting incentives to a more decentralized approach.  Further, Bitcoin's mining, development, and node operations need to be so dispersed that no one can wrangle a movement through political action.  Bitcoin is only incorruptible when it is ungovernable; it is ungovernable when there are too many people to persuade in order to change it.
If Bitcoin becomes governable, we simply have another fiat.  Everyone may know this, but ambition will still move men to bring my it under their control.  I suspect Fenton does not simply want to help; he wants to be the ONE who can help.

You're entertaining absurdity.  Wright was caught red-handed lying about the message he signed this morning.  He claimed it was a signing of some obscure writing, while it was actually just copied from an old Satoshi transaction.  Clearly, this guy is not Satoshi.  See Charlie Lee proving he is the creator of Litecoin (it's easy).
Just as clear as that should be to you, is how clear it is to Gavin who conveniently has no evidence to prove what he supposedly witnessed on the laptop that was provided by Wright.  Gavin knows damn well (just as all of us do) that Wright was lying in his blog post.  Accordingly, Gavin knows damn well that, notwithstanding what he supposedly saw, he was duped and left with no evidence to analyze later.  But instead of back-peddling like any normal person does, he doubles down.  That is so suspicious, that it demands a conclusion that Gavin is hoping (hanging by a thread) to persuade people of the lie that Wright is Satoshi.  Wise up.  Gavin is lying.

Visa and MasterCard are payment networks.  Sometimes payments are for debt and sometimes payments are for currency (debit card).  Debt and currency are often provided by another entity while Visa and MasterCard act as the conduit.  Visa and MasterCard charge high fees to merchants.  
Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a currency AND a payment network combined.  However, the token that acts to represent the currency can be pegged to represent many things (e.g. fiat as Liquid promises to do).


If Bitcoin is adopted by the masses, visa/MasterCard will be irrelevant (unless they change their models).  For debt, creditors will simply use the Bitcoin payment network instead of Visa/MasterCard.  Visa/MasterCard are the middlemen in payments that will be replaced by the Bitcoin payment network.
Now I'm not saying that the brands will cease to exist--they are strong brands that will find a way to adapt.  But I am saying that their payment network will be deemed meaningless, and so if they are to stay in the game they will likely also adopt Bitcoin for their payment network.

That's cute and all, but of course Bitcoin will always have a "payment system" as part of its implementation.  However, Bitcoin was also originally created to include immutability and censorship resistance through decentralization.  This is the feature that distinguishes the otherwise unimpressive payment system.  While Bitcoin isn't under threat of losing the payment network, large increases in resource demand threaten the decentralized nature of the payment system.  Does Bitpay also believe in the original vision of decentralization, or are they just making disingenuous noise?

He promoted himself to "Chief Scientist," at a time when he thought the only possible way to scale Bitcoin was through cap increases.  As soon as it was realized that the Lightning Network was a more viable and feasible alternative he began trying to claw his way back into relevance, doing anything and everything he can to stop its implementation.  Why?  Gavin is one of those guys that doesn't like the idea of Bitcoin being ungovernable (if Bitcoin is governable, we can stop all crime, yada, yada).  His chosen method of scaling is simply pretext for making Bitcoin governable—a practically inevitable path until the lighting network was conceived.

There is no way you believe Gavin actually verified a signature.  He didn't even share that information until after he learned that the world knew that Wright's signature was a forgery.  Then, when he shared that information, it was under the strangest circumstances (flew to London, went to Wright's selected hotel room, used Wright's laptop, and was banned from retaining evidence).  That's a bullshit story.
Even if that had happened, Gavin would have known for sure something was up as soon as he learned there was a forgery.  But instead he doubled-down with "beyond a reasonable doubt."  The "verification" was just another part of the fabrication aimed at hoaxing people into believing Wright is Satoshi despite the forgery.

Combined with those signaling bip91, those signaling BIP141 are at 95%.  All the ones signaling bip91 are doing is voting to make it mandatory that they signal for BIP141.  Ironically, some of them have chosen to vote for the mandate to signal Segwit, but without actually simply signaling for SegWit (BIP141).  If they skipped the show, and simply did what they want to make mandatory, SegWit would just activate.  But the losers in this battle think they are saving face...

I've got Upvotes for this comment.  Everyone knows (whether they wish to admit it or not) that Gavin is lying.  **Gavin knows damn well that Wright is not Satoshi.**  We all do; the man forged a signature to try to prove otherwise.  Still, Gavin is desperately claiming otherwise.  Gavin is lying and even the slow learners have figured it out.  The diehards are hating every minute they defend him, but for them it's the lesser of evils when compared to admitting they were fooled.

Screw that.  Let's see how long he can hold out.  What's the hurry?
The only reason he wants a cap increase is because he fears what will happen to the price without more throughput.  But Segwit gives more throughput.  If there is a bottleneck that causes the price to tank, I suspect he'll run Segwit.  If there is none, then who cares--he was wrong.
One thing is for sure; the holders don't have to sweat.  If that price starts to tank, that's us liquidating our investment.  And if that happens, there's no way in hell Wu will be able to liquidate his--he's got a lot tied up in what would be worthless ASICs.
Should be fun to watch.

Debates are typically over matters of opinion.  They are won by persuading more people than your opponent.  You keep wanting to rehash the matter because you lost.  And yes while the network could technically clumsily scale by raising the cap, there are of course technical reasons that make other methods better.  It's the reason you lost.  
The pretending is coming from you.  You'd like to pretend that you lost for reasons other than merit.

Yes, I think we can all make that conjecture.  However, it is still conjecture.  Do you have a source that the code is never intended to be released?  If so, will the members have access to the source, or must they trust the developers?
To be clear, I am not opposed to a company developing a software for profit and therefore keeping the code confidential.  I would, however, as a commercial user, be deterred from usage without the code.  That's a lot of trust.  Accordingly, I suspect that members do receive the code.  But if this is the case, I don't know how Blockstream intends to protect that code from leak.  A source could be so much better than your obvious conjecture.

Warm that little brain up, this is another few paragraphs of high school level reading…


Do you really think I promised you a jury trial?  Of course not.
In the beginning you thought I promised something that I did not.  It's understandable why you thought this.  Your errors were twofold:
1) As a drug user, you lack the mental care to consider the difference between verifiable and verified.  (A careful reader would have been clued in to determine whether there was some particular meaning behind what I wrote)
2) You didn't recognize that “implied assertion of objectively verified fact” is a highly-relevant "term of art" that has a very specific legal meaning in classifying a statement.  You probably still don’t realize how knowing its meaning would have helped you get to your point several days ago.
However, now that you realize both of these things, you can't help but also realize that I never promised verification, but was merely classifying a statement.  Yet, you still wait... pretending that you don't know any better.  You choose the path of dipshit, supra.  The kind of dipshit who thinks it's not a bad idea to trust anonymous drug dealers with significant funds.  Everyone else knows that you know you’re wrong and refuse to admit it.
However, here’s what you certainly still don’t get.  I only made the statement to help your dumbass out in the argument.  There is obviously nothing literally false about the author’s statement that "drug dealers are not noted for being particularly trustworthy."  You yourself even said:




So then that begs the question:  What is your problem then, with the journalist saying drug dealers aren’t noted as trustworthy?
Rather than require you to strain your tiny drug-harmed brain to articulate an answer, and being a generous and intellectually honest fellow who knows that the matter has already been settled by the very relevant Supreme Court of the United States, I assisted you:


So even though what the author said is technically true, I know you really want to argue about what he implied.  So rather than make you prove what he implied, I conceded it.  You’re welcome.  I helped you cut to the issue that your problem with the author’s statement is not whether it is true or not, but rather whether its implications are true.  Most don’t realize that implications are actionable in Court, and many more would never even concede to argue over implications without you first proving the implications.  I, on the other hand, know that implications are and should be actionable if they are assertions of objectively verifiable fact, which is how a Court would classify what the author was implying.  So being a nice guy, I conceded that the author was asserting:


Further inferences can be drawn that maybe he intended to say that they should not be trusted within society.  Who knows?
Generously, I allowed you to skip all that hard work of getting to your point and instead just took you right where you wanted to go—that the author’s implication was unfair (again you’re welcome).
Then I stated my opposing point so that you could attack it with your logic, which is:  You’re a dumbass to argue the merit of trusting anonymous online carding drug dealers.  Anonymous online carding drug dealers should never be trusted with significant funds.  This is a great path to losing significant money.
Then came the humor.  Instead of arguing your point, you got side-tracked on a misunderstanding you made out of ignorance.  I can’t believe I never saw that coming.  Even still, you have yet argued your foolish point, instead you insist on pretending to wait for me to do something every reader knows that you now know I never promised.  It’s embarrassing, like watching American Idol tryouts, and the person really doesn’t know how bad they suck.  Except your embarrassment is not that you didn’t know what I was saying; it’s that you don’t know that everyone knows that you now do know what I was saying, yet you refuse to admit a simple error.  Even with your tiny brain, no one believes you are this stupid.
But hey, at least I get a little anonymous practice at arguing with idiots, while avoiding having others confuse me for one myself.  People claim this an impossible task, but I think I'm faring well.

No I don’t.  Not at all.  In fact, I think a lot of intelligent people are presently deceived by Gavin.  However, I do think that when an intelligent person is shown damning evidence that they have been deceived, their honest response will not be to double-down on the lie.  Gavin has not given his honest response.  He is lying.


If that were the case, then Gavin would have snapped out of it as soon as he learned that Wright forged the public signature.  Without even knowing what supposedly took place in that London hotel room, we have all the information we need to know that Gavin is lying when he says (and still maintains) that he believes Wright is Satoshi “beyond a reasonable doubt.”
**To determine that Gavin is lying**, all you have to realize is that as soon as Gavin learned that the public signature was a forgery, if he truly believed prior (that Wright is Satoshi), then this revelation would have made him doubt—reasonably doubt.  After all, the signature he supposedly verified was under extremely suspect circumstances (in a London hotel room chosen by Wright; on Wright’s computer; and with Wright retaining all of the “evidence”).  After learning of the forgery, no reasonable person would think it unlikely they were tricked.  But instead, Gavin lies and says he believes Wright is Satoshi “beyond a reasonable doubt.”  TWICE!
Then Electrum (the company that authors the client software purportedly used for verification) confirmed that no .asc file was even downloaded from the U.K. on the day of the supposed “verification.”  And after all this and even more time to deliberate, Gavin decides to bolster the fabrication via twitter.  Gavin is lying.  He knows damn well that Wright is not Satoshi.  These are the actions of a desperate man.
Someone else asked, **“then what is his motive?”**  This is where many are getting tripped up; it’s actually quite simple when you see it (but can take a bit of searching to actually discover).
For some time now, Gavin has been drifting into irrelevance. And being the Bitcoin guy THE thing Gavin has to distinguish himself.  This distinction has, for the last several years, landed him the best seat in the house and a cushy job that requires little actual work. Those are surely in jeopardy if he can't pull off some miracle to make himself relevant again.  The XT fail was bad.  The Classic fail was worse.  Those failures make it clear that in time, Gavin will be completely irrelevant.
If Gavin wishes to salvage his relevance it will require something drastic.  Desperate times accordingly resulted in desperate measures.  If no one would have re-formatted the signature and searched it on the blockchain then Wright would have a lot of people believing he is Satoshi right now.  And Gavin would have a lot of people believing Satoshi whole-heartedly backs Gavin.  It’s fairly risky to hope no one will find that signature, but it’s not far-fetched that they will not.  It is definitely a “Hail Mary” type move, but Gavin has quite a bit at stake, and the agony of defeat is looming.
That is the motive.  And it perfectly and reasonably explains the behavior.  The real bitch of all of this is that it only took about 90 minutes for the fake signature to be determined a forgery.  That was not enough time for the hopeful belief that Wright is Satoshi to even propagate (people form strong biases around initial impressions).  Accordingly, before the idea could even take hold, it was debunked and Gavin was hastily forced to decide how to respond.
Had his decision simply been “Do I still believe Wright is Satoshi?” the answer would easily have been, “I have my doubts.”  But Gavin’s actual decision was “Should I stick with my story, or should I give up on regaining my relevance?”  That’s where he made the mistake.  He did not realize that sticking with his story was not a real option.  He did not realize that there was absolutely no way to still convince people.  In a hasty act of desperation he chose to stick with his lie.  Like so many acts of desperation, it has completely exposed his character.

Consideration of technological advancement is the thing that requires assumption.  You need to get that straight.  I'm not the one assuming.


If some sizes can be "too much," and if user demand goes beyond that amount, then how the hell "must" a fee market be avoided.  It's inevitable if demand goes beyond too much.


This is so short-sighted.  Once it loses its decentralized nature, the people who want to change it back no longer have the ability to.  They can't mine or run nodes.  Accordingly Bitcoin will be left in the hands of a few larger entities who are then supposed to give up their control?

You may be the most intentionally dense person of the day.
Here are his blog quotes:






You, as well as everyone else--including Gavin--knows that he is claiming this is proof that he is Satoshi.  That he may have attempted to obscure its explication with a poor Asiatic writing style is only further evidence that he is intentionally trying to dupe.  This is exactly the sort of thing that should have made Gavin back-peddle.  This is not just a lie, it's lies on top of a lie.  When Gavin realized it, instead of questioning his supposed witnessing, he chose to double-down.  Gavin is in on the hoax.  He wants to persuade people that Wright is Satoshi.  If he didn't, or just didn't care, after a blog post like this, he would have backed away.  He would have at the very least said, "I may have been tricked."  Instead, he feigns certitude that Wright is Satoshi.  It's time to wise up.
@_date: 2015-03-20 00:29:34
Well, adult who is above me.  The term "implied assertion of objectively verifiable" fact is derived from a 1990 Supreme Court case determining when a person's speech may be tried before a jury as defamatory.  
Prior to this case courts tended to categorize all speech through an "artificial dichotomy," as either fact or opinion, with only the former being actionable and the latter being protected.  However, the Court noted that there is hardly a difference between the statement "John is a liar," and "in my opinion John is a liar."  Although one is couched as opinion, both are objectively verifiable assertions.  Thus both statements create a liability to the speaker, if objectively verified to be false.
To objectively verify means to determine whether true or false.  The process for doing this is a trial before the fact-finder (a jury, unless waived, in a defamation action).  So if the court finds a statement "objectively verifiable" it is not finding it to be true or false, it is finding it to be verifiable as either true or false.
The implied assertion that drug dealers aren't trustworthy is as objectively verifiable as that implied from "no one trusts Dave."  The Court would acknowledge that the extreme language was not meant to be taken literally, but the implication that Dave is dishonest is objectively verifiable and therefore a question for a jury to reasonably determine whether true or false.
In this case the question for the jury should be "Are drug dealers generally thought trustworthy?"  No honest and reasonable person would expect a jury to determine that drug dealers are a generally trustworthy group.
When I said it was objectively verifiable, I meant what I said bossman.  It's something a jury could determine whether true or false, not something that has already been determined.  If I meant to say otherwise I would have said "objectively verified."
On my own, however, I also assert that it is obviously true;  so true that no one would waste money arguing otherwise in Court.  Not even a legal weed dealer would try to seek redress over a statement like this, no matter how much business it costs them.  She would lose.

Third.  If you do realize that then why are you trying to be the discussion police for people asking the type of info you are kindof giving.
Fourth.  Threat of dumping any asset goes up drastically when someone suddenly comes into a large portion at once.  Especially when they stole them.  (Rumors range up to four months of rewards.  I want to know as much info I can.  Risk is uncertainty.  Knowledge = less risk)
Fifth.  Everything you've said is worthless on this thread, except that we should dissociate from drugs.  I agree with that.  But you are a total dipshit for not realizing the importance of an event like this to Bitcoin as a whole.  You're also an idiot for trying to play discussion police.

I guess it is asking too much for you to connect the dots and discover your own misunderstanding.
But the correct understanding seems to be that YOU exchange the fiat IOUs on one exchange for those on another (instantly).  Under normal operations the IOUs' values will be roughly equivalent, but if an exchange becomes untrustworthy, you would have the Gox effect I described.
Now I am not saying that I entirely understand how this will work, and if you know something I don't then please let me know.  But your referenced "first sentence" appears to be nothing but assertive conjecture, and if it is, it's unfounded.

That point was a premise to support your ultimate conclusion:


But I do not necessarily agree with the premise.  Enough transactions at 1 Satoshi could be enough to reward miners, especially if a Satoshi is valuable.  But *ad arguendo*, I'll accept the premise that 1 Satoshi fees would not secure the Bitcoin network.  However, I will not accept the leap in logic that leads to this conclusion: 


Miners do not have to collude in order for fees to remain at a profitable level.  And the fact that a miner may theoretically decide to include 1 Satoshi transactions also does not show that all fees will accordingly move to 1 Satoshi.  When a miner deliberates over whether to mine or not, they will calculate the total mining fee required to make the venture worthwhile.  If the blocks are not producing this reward, they will not mine.  If they are, they will mine.  So, if they are mining, and all of the sudden all of the fees drop to 1 Satoshi, after that block, they will quit (along with many others).  And those who continue to mine will do so at a loss, so they too will all accordingly, quit mining.  Thus, in order to get your transaction confirmed, users will put in the fee that miners require.  In other words, the pressure is created by the simple fact that miners will quit without reward--no collusion is required.
However, in reality (where these technical extremes will not exist), miners would actually set minimums and ignore transactions outside that and they would do this in a competitive manner.  This would be in addition to the minimum required total fee reward for them to continue mining.  Because of the practice of setting minimums, there will not be 1 Satoshi transactions.  Even now, it is damn near impossible to clear out the memory pool from transactions with low fees.  Of course, miners could process these and collect that slight extra fee, but in the interest of protecting their market, they do not.  This does not require any more collusion that implementing the policy and somehow making it known.
I say all this, just to entertain the idea.  I am against scaling by large increases in the cap.  I would not be if it were the only way, but with the promise of Lightning, I think hastily increasing the block size is foolish.

@_date: 2015-03-19 20:44:18
All you say is true.  I have not once said that all drug dealers are untrustworthy.  I just insist that trusting anonymous drug dealers with money is a foreseeable route to having the money stolen.
If drugs were legalized, anonymity would go away.  However, I will not concede that drug usage might not go up.  Many people behave irrationally on drugs.  Problems from legalizing might outweigh problems when illegal.  I'm pretty sure that allowing the sale of pcp at 7-eleven is a bad solution.  Maybe weed.  The world is watching results from regions experimenting in legalizing.

It is quite possible that Blockstream recognized the problems inherent in simply clumsily raising the cap to "scale" Bitcoin.  And with that recognition formed to find true workable solutions for profit.  However, that does not make cap increases in any way a better solution.  The suggestion that Blockstream would be injured by cap increases does not settle whether cap increases should be made; Blockstream likely formed on proper recognition that cap should not be increased, which is why they were handily able to quash the debate;it's easier to garner support when you are correct.

That you think it is a BIG word is telling.  I felt a little embarrassment on your behalf when you attempted to correct me while you were in fact wrong.  But it is truly cringeworthy (a ridiculous American Idol horrible tryout type moment) that you think "connotation" is a BIG word.  You are ignorant as fuck and so are those who keep your company; otherwise, you would know this high school word; otherwise, you would know the meaning of "hoax."  And you wouldn't be so God damned lazy that you would refrain from searching Google to educate yourself.

And while everyone can tell that Karpeles hasn't been forthcoming, now there is a partial explanation.  Had he suggested a rogue DEA agent was exploiting him not many would have believed, and it could also have been very dangerous; therefore it was very reasonable not to share that info.
This has to raise some curiosity and doubt in your mind.  Maybe there is more crazy shit that would get his family murdered if he shared???

I do, although I don't need to know.  He claims he saw a verification on a laptop provided by Wright where he was not allowed to keep any evidence.  That's stupid.  But even if it persuaded him, he began to doubt as soon as he saw the forgery.  But he lied and said he was persuaded "beyond a reasonable doubt."
What he actually saw: nothing.
But regardless, even if it is what he claimed, he's lying about still believing.  Hell, even electrum has confirmed that no .asc was downloaded from the U.K. on that day.  Gavin knows (giving the benefit of the doubt that he actually saw something) that at the very least Wright tricked him.  But he maintains otherwise.  He's a liar.

The soft-forked Segwit does not violate this rule (at least not when the rule is properly nuanced).  Although there is a 1,000,000-byte constraint it is not on "block size" (even if this was the intent).  The constraint was on the amount of data between two points that had always been thought to contain the whole of a "block."  In effect, the constraint has been a constraint on block size even though it actually only constrains the data between two points.
Segwit does not violate this rule.  Segwit is the result of "outside of the box" thinking that resulted in a crucial nuanced observation: **there is nothing within the 1,000,000-byte constraint that requires the data counted to include witness data.**
While this may not have previously been contemplated, this is the way the rule operates.  Accordingly, Segwit increases the block size without violating the rule.  To do so, witness data is separated from transaction data (which will still fall within the data points constrained to 1,000,000 bytes).  Segwit does not change the rules; it optimizes space within the rules by more efficiently structuring data.  At the same time it also fixes malleability, makes way for Schnorr, MAST, Confidential Transactions, and Lightning.
The brilliance is that it does all this without the need for a hard fork (because it breaks no rule).  Yet, you are insisting on an unnecessary hard fork?  What gives?
Several months ago, you seemed to be focused on the ethics of allowing an "economic change" (fee increases) without warning users.  This was supposedly the reason you were pushing for a hard fork.  Segwit alleviates your stated concern even better than your proposed solution--without the need to hard fork.  You should be pleased.  That you are not suggests ulterior motive.  **Why do you so badly want to unnecessarily hard fork?**  It can't be for the pretextual ethic concerns--no consensus rules are violated, and this falls in line with keeping fees lower.

This process will take a few weeks to realize, but Gavin will have lost the supportive voices of most of those fervently appealing that we give the benefit of the doubt.

Bingo!  Bitcoin is winning by a landslide.
On a side note, you know that I have been a strong proponent for Bitcoin's immutability. I have been fine even if SegWit doesn't implement if that is a result of Bitcoin's growth in decentralization.
But with that said, the implementation of SegWit is now known (with much thanks due to you) to be blocked for protecting covert "ASICBoost."  You recently came out against BIP148.  I wish you would reconsider.
While under ordinary circumstances 's newer proposals would probably serve best for implementing new features, under the current circumstances SegWit is probably best implemented through BIP148.
Ordinarily, shaolinfry's more recent proposals would be less risky.  But under the current scenario, BIP148 is actually less risky than waiting for a new period.  Currently, it seems we have practically complete community support for SegWit activation under Core 13.1-14.1.  But if we implement under shaolinfry's newer proposals--after the current activation period has expired--we risk the possibility of mandating activation without the community completely upgrading their nodes, because their 13.1-14.1 nodes would no longer be compatible.
Why take this leap of faith (even if it is only a slight risk) when we don't have to?
With respect, I ask you to reconsider your stance.
@_date: 2015-11-23 20:36:23
We guys have already won this battle.  In spite of all your saber rattling, BIP101 implementations have been rejected (for the obvious reason that the network can't handle the massive blocks without risking decentralization--800GB would get us even more transactions.

Was moneygram negligent (did not exercise reasonable care and therefore caused injury)?  Should they have had procedures in place to attempt to detect such a scam?  These would be questions for a fact finder (jury).  If they were negligent, then yes, the could be liable.  Now, at law, there is a concept of negligence per se.  A voilation of the law can be negligence in itself.  For instance, if Moneygram wasn't licensed to exchange money, then this could be negligence per se.  (I would have to do research to no for sure, and I'm not).  But the question could be a question of negligence per se if he were in violation of a money exchange law.  It could also just be negligence if a jury would find that he acted unreasonably and caused harm.

You are obviously confusing Liquid with something else.  Liquid in no way prevents "decentralized blockchain scaling to worldwide levels."
You say, in direct conflict with reality, that "no one should want to use such a centralized, private solution like is being proposed by a financially conflicted for profit company."  Yet, everyday, across the globe, people use Bitcoin exchanges, which fit your description exactly. Liquid promises simply to enhance that usage with instant transactions between member exchanges/services.


What a strange thing to say?  No reasonable person could even infer from what I have said that I conclude Liquid will work.  I hope it will, but we will have to wait a few days/weeks to see if it actually works.


It's as if you think Liquid is the so-called Lightning Network and are therefore using tired old inapplicable arguments against the LN (which is in development) to argue against Liquid.  But even then, it would be an incredibly weak argument to say, on the release of a working LN implementation, that there is no proof it would work.  That argument is effective when there is no code or testing, not after an announced release.  These guys say they have a working implementation of Liquid with several members already prepared for usage, which necessarily implies that they do have proof.  All that is required for public "proof" is a demonstration, which is surely pending.  You cry that there is no proof before there is code, not on the eve of proof being revealed.
You seem like the type of person who lets your emotions completely guide your intellect.  You hate Blockstream, therefore Liquid.  This prejudices you to say that Liquid is not good, but you cannot justify that position with sound reasoning.

I think everyone already knows what you think, but it is also clearly unfounded (as evidenced by your non-support for your conclusion).
"[U]nconstrained Bitcoin" cannot be instantly secure because it requires confirmation.  And secure confirmations in Bitcoin require a lot of resources while they do not in Liquid, hence its speed and huge number of allowable transactions.  More importantly, you've failed to explain (probably even consider) how Liquid would not be just as viable if Bitcoin were "unconstrained."

It's a result of performance improvements within the p2p network.  The faster blocks propagate, the less likely there is a chance for orphaned blocks.
Orphaned blocks occur when two miners solve a block (with different transactions) at roughly the same time and the second miner did not quit searching because it had not yet been informed of the first discovery.  At that moment, both miners begin propagating a different chain.  As the network sees both of these, both chains are kept by nodes, but ultimately the "longest chain" will prevail as the correct chain.  The blocks found on the "losing" chain become invalid to all of the nodes (i.e. "orphaned").  The orphaned blocks could be either the first found or the last, the winning factor is simply which chain is longest.
Of course, as soon as a miner learns of a new block, they quit searching to solve that block.  This problem only occurs when a miner solves a block in the short window between a block having already been found and the second miner's notice of that block.  Improvements in the p2p network shorten that time gap and make orphans less likely thereby improving "confirmation reliability."

Right.  So you were wrong in asserting that holding a patent is no better than asserting a prior art.  Which means you were wrong in saying those who discovered ASICBoost should not have patented it.  The rest is you simply trying to spin out of your illogical stance.


Wrong.  The goal is to prevent someone from using ASICBoost.  A patent does that by giving recourse to the holder, thereby penalizing the infringer.


If I had to speculate, I would say he at one time sought to profit from the patent.  I can't say that he didn't come around to taking the high ground.


Why the hell would they do that if they wanted no one to use it?  Bitcoin is better off if the proof of the work is actually proof of the work.  ASICBoost provides a way to forge such.  Accordingly, licensing this in any form, even a DPL, is less defensive to Bitcoin than simply patenting and disallowing its usage (as is being threatened).
Regardless of speculative motives, this is exactly the right course of action.  The discovery of ASICBoost should patent it.  They should never seek to profit from the patent unless someone infringes.  Under our system, that's the best defense one could provide Bitcoin.

It's real easy to fork Bitcoin.  You just choose to do it, so of course the "gun can actually shoot."
Whether you go it alone, however, is up to the market.  Those with the most to lose would rather not take this risk.  Accordingly, as much as we are interested to see the results of an "actual showdown," this is the best we will ever get.  The actual showdown occurred--again--and they backed down just like with Litecoin and Vertcoin because if they did not, they would be causing a fork that they might find themselves on the losing side of.  And why wouldn't they when so many want SegWit and definitely don't like Jihan cheating with ASICBoost.  It's a no-brainer on which way the market would go.  Moreover, the very threat of a split is already costing them in market value of rewards.

Unsurprisingly, you complain about over excessive reading when your demand is met with a concise and educated response.
I assume you are a user of drugs, as this explains your irrational behavior and your poor choice.  Here you had two options (really only one) for interpreting this short synopsis explaining the test for actionability of a statement in a defamation claim...
1) It was new information to you.  Had you already known this you would not have misunderstood my statement.  After all, in light of this new information, everything said makes perfect sense.
2) The statement "implied assertion of objectively verifiable fact” is just something I made up, which just so happens to be taken directly from Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U.S. 1 (1990) to explain the nuance behind Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323 (1974).  Therefore, luck allows me to "move the goalposts," to change what I meant.
No reasonable person would believe option 2, so—although tenuous—believing option 2 is not a possibility for you either.  Thus, believing option 1, you were left with some embarrassing regret and the question of how you deal with it.  I imagine this is what took you so long to reply after impatiently demanding my response.  You chose poorly!
I had forgotten about this, assuming you were smart enough to just walk away.  This would not have been a horrible move.  Although not the classiest, it avoids humility while preventing further regret.
Then there is the classy move: you could have said something to the effect of "oh, I had never heard of that well-known term of art; I haven't studied law. I misunderstood what you were saying.  Anyway, sorry for being an ass.  I'm glad we have people like you who support Bitcoin.  I wish you supported Darknet Markets as well."  Without a doubt, this was the best move.  Although it requires a little humility, unsavory to all of humanity, at least you walk away from this situation emotionally healthy, a little wiser, and with the appearance of having some integrity.  You didn't choose this!
You didn't even choose the dumb move: to say something like you just did, but immediately after I respond.
You chose absurdity.  Wait a few days and say:


Anyone who reads your response knows everything that you would have outwardly acknowledged from taking the classy move, but now you have no class.  Readers are even more certain of the fact that you are a total dipshit who chooses error to delusionally maintain pride.  People hate this guy.  That's a fact of life.  This is the guy people berate because he deserves it.  No one believes that you even think you have a point.  They know that you are just an ass who won't admit when he is wrong.  The world has one way of dealing with this type of behavior: unsympathetic beratement.  You would do yourself a huge favor if you would repent from this pride, reversing paths now, rather than inviting the beatings to inevitably come throughout your life kiddo.

So, what is locked in at 80% signaling on Bit4 is actually not SegWit.  They are actually locking in a rule to orphan all blocks not signaling Segwit on bit 1.  Once that activates (after another 336 block period), they will then orphan all non-signaling blocks.  This will cause &gt;95% of blocks to lockin Bip141 (original segwit) under a 2016 activation period.  Then, after another 2016 block period, segwit will be activated under Core.
In essence, all BIP91 is is a miner-activated version of BIP148 that activates at a variable block height determined at lockin, rather than at a flagday.  BIP91 is simply their way of pretending this is all miner-activated, when, in fact, they are making damn certain that activating block height comes before August 1.  They do this because they know they'll be powerless at that time.  The absolute best they can do is maintain some appearance of significance.

They are working on the site to include the monitoring of the lockin process of BIP91, which "locks in" after 269/336 of blocks within a 336 block activation period actually signal bit 4 in their version bits.
I don't think they have gotten working correctly yet.
After the lock in and after another 336 blocks (which is 1/6 of the 2016 blocks in a Bitcoin difficulty period), BIP91 will activate.
This is, in essence, the exact same thing as BIP148, but activated at a block height rather than on Aug. 1.  At activation, any block not signaling on Bit 1 will be rejected.
The signaling of Bit 1 is what causes Core to lockin and activate Segwit under BIP141.  But Core uses 2016-block activation periods, and requires 95% to signal in order to lock in SegWit.
BIP91/148 simply make it mandatory to signal Bit 1 in the version bits (i.e., mandatory SegWit signaling).

It's pretty simple.  They don't want their blocks to be rejected.  This is not the first time it has played out either.  Both Litecoin and Vertcoin were implementing BIP148 and the miners pre-activated.
It might be somehow convenient to refuse to acknowledge the causal relationship, but it's definitely not honest.  Jihan likes his ASICBoost.  But even more, he likes having his mining rewards being valued by the market.  As soon as the users agree to quit doing this, he straightens up his act.

The original SegWit BIP is BIP141.  It requires 95% of blocks within any 2016-block activation period to signal for SegWit on bit 1 of the version bits before SegWit locks in.  Once there is lock in, there is another 2016-block waiting period.  Then activation of SegWit.
BIP148, as you say, just sets a flag day (Aug. 1) after which BIP148 nodes will reject any block not signaling for SegWit on bit 1.  This will trigger the BIP141 activation of SegWit.
BIP91, similarly does the same thing as BIP148, but instead of using a flag day, it uses the version bits lock-in mechanism similar to BIP141.  The difference is that its activation period is only 336 blocks and the percentage required is 80%. (The activation period was shortened to ensure activation before the BIP148 flag day of Aug. 1).  Still, once activated, all BIP91 does is the exact same thing that BIP148 does--reject blocks that do not signal for SegWit.  Just like BIP148, it forces the activation of BIP148 after two 2016-block activation periods.
The irony is that instead of the nonsense, the few that agreed to run BIP91 could simply have run BIP148.  OR they could have simply signaled for SegWit (bit 1).
This way, they get to try to pretend that the miners chose.  In reality, BIP148 forced their hand.  Like I said, beating the Aug. 1 deadline is the reason for the shortened activation period.

Everybody likes money.  And Gavin has made it clear that holding Bitcoin is currency speculation and that he doesn't hold much and doesn't recommend holding much.  But regardless, think about what you are saying.
Gavin is some guy who has for the past five years made a living as being the Bitcoin guy.  In the last year it has become increasingly clearer that he has lost his influence.  That's ultimately what this fight has been about; Gavin wants his influence back.  After Classic times are desperate.  Accordingly, so are his s measures.  **There is no damn way Gavin believes Wright is Satoshi "beyond a reasonable doubt"; not after the forgery.**

Still nothing here with merit.  Only ad hominem.  Nothing here is on point; it's all sideshow nonsense.  You wish to stay as far away from merit as possible.  You are a troll.  You have an agenda beyond honesty.
I am not what you are implying by "urgency," but on May 4 Gavin insisted the increasing the cap was urgent.  He has since been proven wrong, as even when you guys spam the network, nothing happens.  You are a troll. You want to stonewall and sidetrack into re-debating well-settled matters in a desperate attempt to get your way.  There is nothing honest about your intent.
please see.  We've caught another troll.
I guess I have to read through edits to know if I have been called a liar.
I was an XT supporter.  I have held Bitcoin since the summer of 2012.  Since that time it was always a foregone conclusion among most of us that in order to scale, the cap would have to be increased.  However, this changed when the lightning network whitepaper was released, but I did not understand why we might not be able to do both.  Accordingly, upon being prompted by Gavin that the cap increase was "urgent" (See his May 4 blog post), I began running XT (even prior to BIP 101--reading further back in my posts will show this).  I continued to run XT for a few days after BIP 101 was released.  This was to show my support for the move.  THEN the "stress tests" came.  At that point I realized that the urgency was manufactured; I realized that all that happens when transactions are full is that fees increase--that proper wallet implementations were all that was necessary to prevent doom.  Recognizing that there is no urgency, I began to question all of my presumptions about Bitcoin scaling.  I realized (reading numerous posts) that the LN could prove far more elegant and that raising the cap could preempt its implementation.
Accordingly, during the debate I set out to explain my reasoning on these subreddits (hence the hundreds of posts doing just that using the forbidden word "urgency").  My message, along with many others has overwhelmingly been more popular than those who support XT (for obvious reasons).  Accordingly, people like u/singularity87 now troll this sub attempting to re-write history through snot-nosed tactics.  They have gotten so obnoxious (with their stonewalling, sidetracking, and ad hominem) that they only way for the sub to maintain value is to delete their content.  It's the only reasonable way to respond to these trolls.  In this instance, there is nothing of merit in the argument, only attacks on people--myself included, and I have not done anything but changed my mind and explained to others why.

**Gavin is lying his ass off.**  He knows damn well--just as all of us do--that Wright is not Satoshi.  Still, he lies and says he believes "beyond a reasonable doubt."  Twice! And is still tweeting about it.
As badly as you sycophants wish he would quit with the lying, you can't make it so.  What good would it do anyway?

It's a bit risky, but if no one re-formatted the signature and found it already on the chain, much of the world would be persuaded that Wright is Satoshi.  Even if days passed, it's hard to overcome the bias associated with first impressions.  Gavin's idea could simply be a hail-Mary to have a Satoshi back his idea.   
The failures of the last year have diminished his influence.  If he is too succeed in co-opting Bitcoin, the desperate times demand desperate measures.  Once Segwit implements the "urgency" is gone.   Once Lightning is shown to be viable, the urgency is gone forever.  Fake Satoshi was likely the last hope.  And had his forgery not been discovered so quickly, Gavin would not be so badly implicated.
When confronted with the forgery Gavin's decision was not whether to continue to believe Wright.  Instead he had to decide whether to stick with the story.  Because the story had just started he lied and decided to say he believed "beyond a reasonable doubt."  This was his big downfall.
If Gavin would have realized how unbelievable it is for him to claim he believes Wright, he might have saved himself a lot of credibility (still losing plenty) by saying he was no longer certain and that he would have to figure out if he was tricked.  But his desperation lead him to double-down on the lie, hoping he could persuade people fostered adamance.  Then it was too late.  Now honest people simply cannot believe he was tricked.  A reasonable mind has to at least acknowledge that Gavin is untrustworthy.

BIP91 is simply miner-activated BIP148.  SegWit2x (whatever it is, because it's still in development) includes BIP91 and some bogus hard fork in a few months.
Because SegWit2x is not ready (and nobody trusts is), and because the miners want to be certain to beat their Aug 1 deadline per BIP148, the miners are running the latest version of Core patched with BIP91 to go ahead and activate BIP148 compliance which will activate SegWit via BIP141.
No one really cares about the hard fork part that is supposed to be 2x.

I am a lawyer (on and off the internet).  And if you were, you would realize that having a patent gives the holder something called a "cause of action" when someone infringes upon it.  When a patent holder litigates an infringement, success means they get money from infringer.  When someone fights a patent application asserting prior art, they get no money for preventing the patent, just legal fees.
Accordingly, holding the patent does tend to make people stop blatantly infringing.  There's nothing magical about it either.

We have enough facts to conclude that Gavin is lying.  We need few.
Let's analyze it:
Relevant Fact 1: We know that Wright lied in his post.  The signed message he provided publicly is claimed to be a hash of an obscure [Sartre writing]( when it is actually just a signature [copied from an old Satoshi transaction]( already recorded on the blockchain (of course it verifies).
Relevant Fact 2: Gavin knows that the signature is not real.  Everyone knows it.
Expected behavior: If Gavin was actually convinced that Wright was Satoshi, the lie above should cause him to question that belief.  A reasonable person would begin to doubt.  And that doubt would cause an honest person to back down from their previous assertion.  That would be even more true under the strange circumstances that Gavin claims he verified the signature (overseas with a laptop provided by Wright where he was not allowed to keep any of the evidence).
Actual behavior:  Gavin doubled-down.  With certitude he proclaims Wright is Satoshi--"beyond a reasonable doubt!".  Conveniently, the proof he needed to be persuaded is no longer available to him.  But as we all intuitively know, that proof was offered under such strange conditions, that a reasonable person would not be so confident in it once they learned that the originator is openly lying.
Inference:  Why would Gavin double down when there is no way (based on what he said) he is truly certain?  **He must really want people to believe that Craig Wright is Satoshi.**
Further Inference:  Why would Gavin want to convince people that Craig Wright is Satoshi?  Draw your own conclusions.  What I know is **Gavin does not believe Wright is Satoshi, yet he is still asserting otherwise.**

The cost to the well-connected node operator is clearly far less than it would be if Bitcoin were "scaled" on chain, which would require data-center nodes.
This method could allow for enthusiasts to maintain the network at very little cost and practically zero barriers to entry, departure, and re-entry.  If any authority starts trying to target individual node operators, other triggered enthusiasts will quickly replace them 10-fold.  That will not be the case with an on-chain approach.

While Gavin is a bit naive/gullible.  In this instance his behavior isn't innocent; he's lying.  He knew for damn certain that Wright is not Satoshi the moment he knew that signature was forged.

So you think those are absolute rights: the absolute right to communicate with words and with money?  Do you recognize any other absolute rights?  For instance, the right to quiet enjoyment of the home?  If so, what do you do when the exercise of one right interferes with the rights of another?  
For instance, does my neighbor have the right to destroy my  property right by pointing loud speakers at my house at all hours of the night and blast defamatory comments that keep me awake all night?  He's merely exercising his right to communicate; Yet, in the process harmfully infringing on my rights.
An honest answer to this leads to the conclusion that we don't have absolute rights (they are always curtailed in some way).  But that makes life far more difficult than the typical libertarian/anarchist can handle.  Instead of just having blanket black/white ideals from which to narrowly view and judge the world, the problem of societal rights allocation then becomes quite nuanced.

Bitcoin as you currently know it does not have to change at all for sidechains to exist (and barely change at all for the better sidechain to exist).  The idea of a "side" chain is actually only conceptual.  In reality, a sidechain is a totally separate system from Bitcoin and has no effect on Bitcoin.  However, what makes it a side chain is that it takes its queues from the status of coins locked in the Bitcoin Blockchain.

Many have the misconception that miners work hard to *verify* transactions.  They don't.  Verifying transactions is easily done by any non-mining node.
The hard work of mining is not for verification.  It's only a means of creating an objective measure for determining which of those easily verified transactions will be confirmed in a block.  Without their proof of work, there would be no trustless measure for distinguishing the validity between multiple competing blocks.  In essence, miners may as well be digging holes and filling them over and over again until they find a magic number that every node **agrees** is the correct number.  Holding this number (solution) gives the authority to decide the transactions that are in the block (the solution is actually calculated with the transactions pre-selected).  It also gives the right to claim the block reward and fees.

By calling it timestamping you would be confusing the issue.  These guys used a hash of a digital work and timestamped it on the blockchain (the first decentralized publicly verifiable ledger).
Although timestamping is part of the process, there are still certainly more parts of the process that warrant giving the entire process its own name.  Also, the purpose behind the process is unique from and narrower than purposes behind mere timestamping.  The purpose is to prove the existence of an electronic document at a specific time in history.  Timestamping has never served this purpose, because there has never been a blockchain--which can't be changed by a single entity.   Thus "proof of existence" is a proper and suitable name.
Don't be a curmudgeon.

When endless debate still results in divide, there is no better arbiter than actual results.  Unfortunately, life doesn't always provide results as an option to settle the matter, so debate ensues.

By including the transaction with a 1 Satoshi fee the miner is hurting his negotiating position by signaling to the market a willingness to accept less if the transaction is known (this concept can be read about in the same managerial accounting text books that talk about sunk costs).  But for the sake of the one block I can agree that the miner could rationally (probably not reasonably) decide to include the 1 satoshi transaction because it increases reward on the one block.  Of course this would involve not setting a minimum fee, but instead a minimum aggregate fee (which I think is what you are getting at).  So for the sake of theory land I'll accept your proposition that it could be thought to be in one's best interest to include the Satoshi transaction.
However, I think in reality (as in other business practices) a minimum per transaction fee would also be established because it works against the longer term interest of the miners not to do so.  Even presently, low fee transactions are sitting in the memory pool for weeks.
Under your scenario where 1 satoshi is rationally accepted, what happens?

It's not time to compromise.  Wu has no leverage.  Segwit is a block size increase.  If Wu believes we need one or else Bitcoin will die, then Wu stands to lose more than all of us by refusing to adopt it.  We can liquidate our holdings, but that mining equipment and all of those Bitmain development dollars go to waste if he attempts to *stand on principle.*
This is an easy hand to play.  Once most miners have adopted Segwit and people are getting restless, then someone will force a panic and the price will begin to tank.  It will seem that the only way to recover the price is to increase throughput.  Wu will either do it or continue to suffer lower returns.  Meanwhile those who caused the price to tank will be sitting on the sidelines with their cash ready to re-enter.
Wu's in no position to create a Mexican Standoff.  The gun he holds points only at his head.

You oppose in good faith.  Garzik opposes in order to be a somebody.
You may analyze an idea with a critical eye that results in opposition.  Garzik, instead, analyzes how opposing an idea might enhance his recognition and decides then whether he will feign the critical eye to rationalize his pre-determined conclusion--opposition.  That's what I mean by "opposer."

With the other guy, I qualified the "how do you know?" with "other than through the consistent hash rate."  I hoped to avoid the circular logic.  I see your smiley, so I assume you are writing tongue and cheek.


That does not matter.  The hardware is a sunk cost.  The operational decision is simply a question of whether the revenue from running the rig outweighs the cost of operating the rig, which is basically a function of electricity cost.  If, prior to the halving, a miner was mining at revenue of 20% greater than operational costs, then now they are hashing at a loss.
In fact, only miners with pre-halving revenue at &gt;200% of operational costs should presently be in the black.
Surely there have been older rigs mining at less than 100% profit.  And surely those represent a substantial percentage of the hash rate.
I suspect many of those rig operators are in a wait-and-see mode to see if there is a price bounce to compensate.

Gavin is lying.  Nothing is hard to explain when you accept that premise.  Fake Satoshi would be helpful to Gavin, so he got in on a hoax (you know, greater-good bullshit that liars often convince themselves of).  Now he is in too deep to back-peddle.  He'll find a way.
@_date: 2016-05-06 17:45:01


Motive is what is tripping some up.  But it’s actually quite simple when you see it.
For some time now, Gavin has been drifting into irrelevance. And being the Bitcoin guy THE thing Gavin has to distinguish himself.  This distinction has, for the last several years, landed him the best seat in the house and a cushy job that requires little actual work. Those are surely in jeopardy if he can't pull off some miracle to make himself relevant again.  The XT fail was bad.  The Classic fail was worse.  Those failures make it clear that in time, Gavin will be completely irrelevant.
If Gavin wishes to salvage his relevance it will require something drastic.  Desperate times accordingly resulted in desperate measures.  If no one would have re-formatted the signature and searched it on the blockchain then Wright would have a lot of people believing he is Satoshi right now.  And Gavin would have a lot of people believing Satoshi whole-heartedly backs Gavin.  It’s fairly risky to hope no one will find that signature, but it’s not far-fetched that they will not.  It is definitely a “Hail Mary” type move, but Gavin has quite a bit at stake, and the agony of defeat is looming.
That is the motive.  And it perfectly and reasonably explains the behavior.  The real bitch of all of this is that it only took about 90 minutes for the fake signature to be determined a forgery.  That was not enough time for the hopeful belief that Wright is Satoshi to even propagate (people form strong biases around initial impressions).  Accordingly, before the idea could even take hold, it was debunked and Gavin was hastily forced to decide how to respond.
Had his decision simply been “Do I still believe Wright is Satoshi?” the answer would easily have been, “I have my doubts.”  But Gavin’s actual decision was “Should I stick with my story, or should I give up on regaining my relevance?”  That’s where he made the mistake.  He did not realize that sticking with his story was not a real option.  He did not realize that there was absolutely no way to still convince people.  In a hasty act of desperation he chose to stick with his lie.  Like so many acts of desperation, it has completely exposed his character.

Especially after the Ethereum debacle, exchanges would begin by offering the original/real Bitcoin and the fake/forked for trade.  The market wouldn't switch.  The miners would come right back.  We've been saying this for months, now we've shown it to be true.  The only thing that has kept the fake ETH going so far is that all the exchanges colluded to call it the real Ethereum and the real coins by a different name (Ether Classic).
The market, however, is quickly figuring out that they've been duped into a bait-n-switch and is therefore in the process of switching the value back to the real Ethereum--the one where only private keys move coins (not emotion).
When it comes to Bitcoin, there's not a chance in hell that the exchanges could get away with calling a fake chain the real one.  Especially not now that we are all wise to the trick.
@_date: 2016-07-26 22:27:06
What's worse is they aren't even selling Ether.  They are selling the tokens on a chain that forked after a 51% attack and calling it Ether.
Most of the exchanges colluded on this bait-n-switch.  Accordingly, the duped the market for a short time.  The market, however, is quickly figuring out what they did and is accordingly moving the value back to the real Ether, which the exchanges are deceptively calling Ether Classic, instead of what it really is: just Ether.  What they are calling Ether is a fraud.
This little scam that they pulled allowed the smarter of the DAO bag holders to dump their fake Ether for real Ether prices and then quickly increase their actual Ether holdings (by up to five times) by purchasing what the exchanges are calling Ether Classic which is trading at a severe discount while the market figures out it was totally scammed by collusive exchanges.
I suspect lawsuits are coming.

How does a technical analyst factor it in?  What formula could be used?  There is no net present value/capm way of evaluating.  Everyone knows it should be worth more, but no one can determine what it should be worth.  That sort of uncertainty is "risk."  Risk lowers market value.  Accordingly, it seems most likely that any preemptive "pricing in" will fall on the fairly conservative side of forecasting.
For example, if it generally seems that Bitcoin should be worth 8 times what it was before the halfing, the market may conservatively double the price prior to, because no one can be too certain of that "eight times" figure.
@_date: 2016-07-10 13:38:11
This makes little sense.  Of course hardware costs are sunk.  But there were/are surely miners that earn a small return over their electricity costs.  After the halving those are losing money if they continue to run their rigs.
Hand waving sunk costs does not explain this behavior.

Gavin's getting desperate.  Fake Satoshi hinged on nobody reformatting and finding the signature already on the blockchain.  Not far-fetched at all, but risky.  The goal was not to prove, but persuade, that Wright is Satoshi.  Somehow he has to get control of Bitcoin back and having Satoshi in his corner seems like his only remaining chance.
Gavin dropped the lead of Bitcoin before viable alternative scaling methods were introduced.  Prior to that, his only foreseeable means of scaling involved growing resource consumption to a level that necessarily brought Bitcoin under government purview.  Shortly after the lightning network was introduced Gavin went apeshit (See slew of blog posts).  He started trying to force Bitcoin down the path he previously thought was inevitable.  BIP101 would have done this.  
After BIP101 failed, the plan got more desperate; just win back political control through a minor change.
After that failed, the only other option is to bring in someone with more political clout than himself.  Enter fake Satoshi.  If fake Satoshi can't be sold, the jig is up.  Accordingly, we have the desperate hoax.
Once people see Bitcoin scaling via payment channels, there's no more opportunity to co-opt Bitcoin.  This is why Gavin is behaving so desperately.

Gavin's most innocent claim in all of this would have been that he was hacked.  If Gavin was hacked, then once security was repaired, there would be a more meritorious argument for restoring commit rights.
The only reason it was suggested that he was hacked is because otherwise he just personally vouched for an obvious scammer (forged signature).  But rather than back peddle from that position he still maintains that Wright is Satoshi.  There is no goal post moving.  That he kicked the ball 60 yards when only 25 was needed does not change the fact that he split the uprights.  It would be better for Gavin if he were hacked.

Just to expound upon this, under Howey it wasn't the land that was deemed a security, it was the leaseback agreements for the conveyance of land that were deemed securities.  They were determined to be "investment contracts" under a four-pronged test.  Bitcoin might seem (with unreasonable contortion) to satisfy the four prongs, but that's not enough.  There is no contract.  There is no promoter or third party.  Accordingly, Bitcoin wouldn't even satisfy the first requirement to even introduce the Howey test.  Even if it did, there are many use cases for Bitcoin that don't satisfy the prongs of Howey.  Bitcoin is not a security.  Bitcoin could, however, be packaged in a security that would satisfy Howey (i.e. GBTC/Winklevoss ETF).

I'm floored.
You said


But there has been no drop in hash rate, so then according to you, it must not make sense for miners to shut down their rigs (i.e. mining still covers their electricity costs).
Your explanation of miner behavior was that it makes economic sense.  But according to you, the only way that is possible is if prior to halving, "nearly all miners somehow ha[d] a gross profit margin greater than 100%."
But according to you that scenario is "absurd."
Ironically, the "absurd" scenario is the only scenario you've used to explain the behavior.
How could you not realize that you are contradicting yourself?
It's as though you thought you had made some other assertion and that I had made Your assertion to argue against it.  All that has really happened is that you made an assertion--that miners were previously operating at &gt;100% profit.  And now you call that assertion absurd.  The funny part is that you seem to think you have defeated someone other than yourself in an argument.
My position has always been that your assertion is absurd, which is why I called you on it.  It's also why I asked, when you claimed to have "Empirical Evidence,"


You responded with


in other words, you made up the "Empirical Evidence" you referenced.
Another funny part is that you think it is "clear and unambiguous" evidence to prove that what you asserted actually happened, which you think is "absurd."  I know it is evidence of the absurd.  I know that what you were saying was absurd, which is why when you claimed to have "Empirical Evidence" to support your absurd assertion, I asked to see any evidence that you have other than the sustained/rising hash rate.
This is a ridiculous conversation.  There could be several explanations for your behavior, but I suspect it is one of those deals where you simply think so highly of yourself that you see no need to question what you've said, because the fact that you've said it makes it true.

If everyone holds, value is through the roof (infinite).  Bitcoin would be priceless.  No amount could get it out of the hands of its holders.
Of course, that scenario is absurd.  But Bitcoin's growth in market cap is purely a reflection of more people unwilling to quit holding at lower prices.  Bitcoin is far off from having velocity of money accounting for its value.  Gold is too for that matter.

Mining or non-mining nodes both reject (rather than orphan, which I misused to fit common jargon) blocks.  In this case, BIP148/BIP91 nodes, whether mining or not, will reject any block not signaling bit 1 after their activations.
And... if a chain is presented to a non-mining node that has more work behind it, that node will decide to orphan the blocks in the chain it held with less work.  That all nodes will do this is part of "Nakamoto consensus."

I mean they provide a solution to a problem that would indicate that they, on average, must have performed a certain number of calculations (hashes), when, in fact, they have performed far less.
The solution is supposed to "prove" how much work they have done, hence "Proof of work."  But, just like a quantum breakthrough, with ASICBoost they are able to provide the solution without actually performing all of the work.  This is a loophole that allows forging the proof, and it needs to be fixed!
It turns out that SegWit was inadvertently designed in such a way that prevents the use of ASICBoost.  SegWit is the fix, which is why they have been blocking it.  This is why BIP148 is going through.

After a planned 51% attack (where coins are moved by people controlling 51% of the hash rate, but not the private keys) all the exchanges started calling the new illegitimate chain Ethereum, but the real Ethereum chain did not die and most of the exchanges started to trade it again, but under the misnomer Ethereum Classic (ETC).  This is the one true Ethereum because it doesn't have fraudulant transactions from the 51% attack.
Now that most of the smarter DAO holders have passed their fake Ether off to greater fools, they are using their funds to purchase back the real Ether (ETC) and the market is starting to figure out that it has been bait-n-switched and is switching value from the fools' gold back to the real Ether (ETC).
So, as you can see, it's a huge clusterfuck.  I won't be surprised to see the entire market tank for both the real and the fraudulant chains.

There are many appropriate responses to this.  New Hampshire illustrates one of them.
In 2015, New Hampshire passed legislation that crippled the ability of Bitcoin businesses.  Two years later, under pressure from voters, New Hampshire is freeing Bitcoin businesses from having to register as money services businesses.

No.  I mean higher security than we have now.
**Security in cryptocurrencies is not measured by hashes; it's measured by the difficulty (impossibility) of attaining 51% of those hashes.**
Presently, we are very insecure, because one entity has been forging their "proof" of work and has accordingly been able to exert undue influence over more than 51% of the hash rate.
It is a very *insecure* for Bitcoiners have to trust Bitmain rather than relying on a POW algorithm that allows a more decentralized miner-base.  The distributed decentralization is what makes Bitcoin trustless.  That there is no trusted authority is what secures Bitcoin.  Otherwise, we just have a latent fiat system.

Lol.  So was "Bitcoin Classic."  It turned out to be a lot more difficult than that and even after all the work, it still was buggy.

Two things:  1st, give up the notion of scaling by simply increasing the block size--it doesn't work while keeping Bitcoin's fundamental property of decentralization that makes it "premium."  2nd, instead scale by using the Lightning network for lots of small, fast, and cheap transactions that can later be settled (if ever needed) on that premium blockchain.

Haha.  He's a fraud.  He forged the signature.  Everyone knows that, especially Gavin.
How does it feel to have your leader force you in to the ridiculous position of having to defend the notion that Craig Wright is Satoshi?  We are more certain Wright is not Satoshi than we are of any other person in the world.

That makes Bitcoin seem "cheap."  $2,680 connotes high value.

Here, Randall Lord claims he registered with FINCEN, but they lost the paper work.  The judge would not let him withdraw the guilty plea, because he apparently should have registered with the US Treasury.  Moreover, Louisiana has no MSB licensing requirements (per an AG opinion that Lord relied upon).
This is a risky business no matter the state.  And it's not just money at stake.  While there are factions of government that are progressive towards these matters, there are also laggards (like Alec Van Hook) that think they are acting in accordance with the will of authority upon high when they go after anyone connected with Bitcoin.
I see it's to our benefit to encourage people to take these risks; it promotes Bitcoin at someone else's risk.  But Randall Lord is fucked!  And if this guy listens to you, he's risking the same even if he takes reasonable efforts to comply with the law.  Some of these assholes hellbent on going after this, and they are finding ways.

BIP148 is coming.  ASICBoost will be dead soon.
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:41:47


Just like all vaporware.  Mark my word, SegWit2X will never be completed in working fashion.
All that will ever happen is that miners will modify their Core nodes to signal as though they were running SegWit2X.  They'll do this; SegWit will activate; there will never perform a hard fork.  They'll never even run the vaporware.  Just like when miners have been pretending to run BU, they'll just continue to run Core. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:26:57


Possibly.  And it will likely serve this function if BIP148 remain an imminent threat.
However, IF BIP148 support wanes, then Segwit2X could simply serve as another stall tactic to keep ASICBoost beyond Aug. 1.  **Stay the course!!!**
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:27:37
Vaporware.  They don't even know the supposed parameters which are an ever-moving target.
Edit:  Anyone can create a github repo and fart around as Garzik has done.  In his first attempt to "increase" the block size, he changed the wrong number (the legacy max_block_size) instead of the only one that matters (block weight).  This stupid error was made after months of having it explained to him.  He still did not understand.  He is inept, and the code will never exist in functioning form--like all of the other supposed challenging predecessors.
**Segwit2x is vaporware.**

There are some fighting.  There are others for.  The growth in popularity is going to result in filling the electorate with more who are for.  In the meantime, we must slow down the laggards.

It sucks, except the SegWit part.  If they do that part immediately, then great.

Not originally.  Originally, Classic was simply a "one constant" change to 2 MB.  It turned out that changing that constant was a lot more complicated.  There were changes to over 700 lines of code and, like I said, it was still buggy.
After that attempt failed, the project lived on and morphed into the clusterfuck it is now.

If by "backed by" they mean "What gives it value?" :
I ask them "What is the dollar backed by?" Answer: US government.  
Then I ask "What is the US government backed by?" Answer:  The people of the US. 
Then I explain that Bitcoin skips government and just gets its backing directly from the people who use it.  The more people who use it the stronger its backing.
Then I give them time to think about this.  A normal person should need quite a bit of time to conceptualize this and then develop new questions that they can probably answer themselves.
Edit:  This would also be my answer to the question "What is gold backed by?"

Just a github repo maintained by an inept.  Segwit2x, whatever it is considering after all of the never-ending changes in parameters, will never be completed.  Vaporware.

If they agreed, why aren't they signaling (rather than putting some meaningless verbage in the coinbase area)?

This mindset is quickly changing.  Upper echelon is beginning to respect the profit like any other, because a lot of upper echelon types have come out as early crypto holders.  The followers will follow their lead.
I know quite a few highly educated and respected people who have finally began to be forth coming about their previously secret crypto holders.  Like always, the smarter of society have been quietly acquiring while the rest remain ignorant and skeptical.  Once the rest figure it out (as they are beginning to), they realize that those wealthy from crypto are just like--and often actually the same people--those who are always outsmarting the rest of society.  And as this happens, the narrative changes.  But by this time, the onlookers are too late, as usual.

Not a bluff.  148 is happening and if it results in a split, then so be it.
Most of us are confident that the market will side with SegWit, but if it does not, we are fine with the outcome.
I do not expect Jihan to ever acquiesce.  The value of ASICBoost is worth the risk of the damage he can cause to the market.  Accordingly, we are going to run BIP148 and he is going to split.  To him, the chance that people might follow is worth more than simply giving up ASICBoost and keeping Bitcoin as a single chain.
