I guess I have managed it. I played this game at school solving IQ questions. The way it works is to remove firstly all the "SMALLEST" words as they are for distructing. Since backup words are 12, you have to draw lines as:
Column: 4
Row: 3
Then get rid of all the words that are touching the lines and leave the ones that are in particular boxes. And here the games start. You have to collect the words 1 from each blocks and create 12 word combinations.
I havent tried but would be nice if any of you try it. And, please dont be greedy. When you break it, give some to me too :)
