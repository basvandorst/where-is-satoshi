“As a comedian, I always get into situations where I’m auditioning for movies and sitcoms, you know? As a comedian, they want you to do things besides comedy. They say, ‘Alright you’re a comedian, can you write? Write us a script. Act in this sitcom.’ They want me to do shit that is related to comedy, but it’s not comedy, man. It’s not fair, you know? It’s as though if I was a cook, and I worked my ass off to become a really good cook, and they said ‘alright you’re a cook… can you farm?’

How did you go about selling? I don't imagine I'll be doing it soon, but I want to know what to do when the time comes. Do you just sell back to Coinbase / gdax? Do you use another site? How were the funds transferred to you? Someone was saying CB has like a $50,000 limit. How do you sell higher amounts?
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:09:34

Ohh. Right right.

Wow, I haven't seen one of these threads in forever.
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:43:54
Which is crazy to me, because watching the buy column on btc-e, I would constantly see high amounts. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:53:44
Oh, ok. So when people say it's not profitable, they mean, "It's not profitable to start now given the start up cost." I was thinking the difficulty was just too high to yield any return.
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:48:43
I'm not one to rain on anyones parade, but I'm not sure that's how you're supposed to ingest it.

I did the math. It would take me 5 million months to mine 1 BTC at the current hashrate with my computer set up. That's not an exaggeration. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:50:09
I guess the next big drop will be after the BTC-e fiasco later this year.

From what I understand:
You sell me 1 BTC.
I pay $600 to you via paypal.
You send me the BTC.
I dispute the claim with paypal saying you never sent me the item.
You can't show them proof that you physically sent me anything. With other (tangible) items, there's proof via mail and the likes. BTC is all electronic, so there's no trace. And it's hard to say "No, this random group of alphanumerics is my address, and this one is his."

While I'm not accustomed to it, it really makes the most sense. If you  do dd/mm/yyyy, you start with "22nd" but that hasn't narrowed it down at all. That covers hundreds of years in the past, and infinite in the future. If you start with "2021" you have it down to a specific year. Then you move to a month to narrow it down, then a day. It's like a funnel.
