I think you can figure out yourself then why such a transaction would never arrive.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:37:40
You bought a ledger but have no clue how Bitcoin works? Are you for real?
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:47:52
If you're at that point you should just take out half (still a massive amount of BTC and it might triple again in value anyway) and invest in other assets for peace of mind.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:51:18
Also got some alts?
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:51:38
It does make sense that you're waiting but you could also be wrong and the next crash/dip happens in 2018 when it crashes from 20k to 15k.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:50:00
Take the amount you have more of than your hedge and put it into safe funds. Then rinse and repeat. Out hedge the hedge and still be safe.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:12:36
Congratulations. It is something to be envious of.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:41:13
When will that be?
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:12:13
please be joking.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:12:13
please be joking.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:00:13
Why are you talking about CNN or Fox? I specifically talked about RT.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:03:42
Well, have a nice day. Sorry for getting so triggered at you.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:23:28
Bitcoin might have a bright future, yes. Diversifying is still not a bad idea because it is safe. What if the Trump administration suddenly decides that Bitcoin = terrorism and kills all traffic to make it illegal? 
Crazy things can happen. The United States just left UNESCO, just saying.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:34:33
I honestly don't care, you just keep going about other topics. It is not news to anyone that bias exists in these American TV channels you mentioned. 
Intentional or not. Whataboutism is annoying as fuck. RT is definitely not a media source to be taken seriously if you value objective news in any way.
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:27:24
First of all you don't need to be rude. Secondly I know that sometimes on the internet the intended meaning can get lost: I didn't say you should do what I mentioned in my previous post above. But there are people with no sense who do that, who put all eggs in one basket. My point was exactly that: diversify.
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:50:18
I would give it a C+. Nice effort but the typos and choice of words need some serious work.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:54:11
Do you have some links or directions or maybe can say a few words about those strategies?
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:21:59
I would not want a gift card, I would want my money back.
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:18:31
I hope you are all reporting the ad instead of just bashing Google.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:09:25
Can you quote the parts where I sound "like a little girl"and where I'm "bitching" or "moaning"? 
I'm not upset but you on the other hand sound quite distressed over my comment.
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:47:04
So dramatic.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:55:57
Are you roid raging or something? Reading your posts is like imagining you hammering your keyboard while spittle is flying at the screen. Jesus man.
@_date: 2017-10-15 09:32:11
Not only Bitcoin though. All investments. Everything can crash and burn. Germany's VW was stable as rock with a bright future and then the scandal happened. I bet a few people put their savings in that company.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:00:29


You could have stopped right there, made me not read the rest or care what you have to say anymore.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:27:03
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:30:19
Just be strong.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:32:13
I just learned this yesterday, so don't worry.
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:13:50
Then Donnie comes along and thinks that BTC is a "bad deal for Murica" and there it goes.
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:49:05
People will continue using the Euro while Spain dissolves their regional parliament.
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:36:53
I just want to buy one full Bitcoin because it looks ugly with a first digit zero :/
Please dip already.
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:31:20
Jesus, reading through that thread is like or .
@_date: 2017-10-15 09:18:36


Sometimes this stuff hits me hard. I had surgeries and therapies but never paid more than a few hundreds. It really sucks that some people don't live in countries with proper healthcare. Sorry for the offtopic.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:20:22
Do you have a link for more explanations about this?
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:21:31
For those curious ones: 
@_date: 2017-10-15 09:20:27
Be as it may, I will still be patient for a bit and watch if it goes under 4.5k. Just never buy or sell out of panic. Expect everything.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:39:17
A statement which would only make sense if you looked at the price, read about Bitcoin in 10 minutes, looked again and then came to this conclusion.
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:01:57
Question: why are the mods not deleting these nonsense prophetic posts?
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:16:41
Looking forward to the post crash depression in here while I'm buying more on the dip. Don't expect to find rationality here. 80% of the posts here are childish memes and that kind of worries me for the user base. Are all those meme posters teenagers who are putting everything they have in BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:25:00
Couldn't that someone just be the guy who wants to buy himself a mansion and a 747 while the rest of his 20k BTC continues to grow?
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:47:53
I'm very triggered because there are people out there who unironically call RT legit news. Such a crazy world we live in.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:59:52
I'm new to all this: How does this thing work?
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:54:08
And down it goes again.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:36:12
History never repeats but there might be similarities. It's also good to know how worst case scenarios played out: 
What you described is basically a bubble that burst in the end. Is bitcoin a bubble? Who knows.
@_date: 2017-10-14 08:45:23
Are you serious?
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:29:54
Then give me a dip!
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:26:36
One would think that this is all obvious in a way. Really strange how some people manage to defy all reason and logic with finances. I wonder how the world would look like if money and keeping finances in check was a school subject.
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:56:45
Wouldn't you lose due to inflation?
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:35:46
I disagree. RT is pushing propaganda and clearly has a political agenda.
