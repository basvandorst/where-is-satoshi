He is being charged with it in the upcoming Maryland trial. He also wrote about all the hits in his diary. 
Just because you are a drugs user doesn't mean you have to make up shit to defend your hero.

What makes you possibly think they want this. Get a grip. It won't happen. Get back to reality.

And the customer there doesn't want to use Bitcoin. Maybe 1 in 100k does. Again, get back to reality. Try to look outside this sub every now and then. It will be healthy for you.

"Grounded reality". How high are you right now?
So you have no proof whatsoever that he didn't order those hits? As i said before you just pulled that out of your ass because he's your druggie hero and has to be innocent? Seriously? That would be so sad.

Hahaha wtf???
No, her son is a kid who ran a drug market and tried to have 5 people killed. 
My god, you people are completely delusional. I take it you're a drugs user?
And where the hell did you get the idea he didn't order those hits? You just pulled that out of your ass because Ross is your druggie hero? Or do you have proof for this?

At some point in life you can expect someone to be old and smart enough to use the search button if he has a question which very likely has been asked before.
Also noticed how he didn't even thank the person who took the time to explain things to him.
These kids are all the same. They don't care about Bitcoin in the first place. They just post here demanding a quick answer on how they can make free money. They always get the same reply: you can't. And then quickly dissapear again.
The same shit every single day. Stop answering these people.
