They won't they have millions in hardware right now.

Oh no the same troll again. Last time he posted he said he'll have proof GAW is a scam, he was called out and had nothing so he deleted his post :D What a tool!
Oh and on bitcointalk you can find posts by some hater "suchmoon" that wrote the same thing as you here. Is that your alt? What a fail.
@_date: 2014-11-05 04:15:29
Did you buy bitcoins this year? Congratulations on your profitable investment!
@_date: 2014-12-01 13:47:18
Are you expecting shipped stuff from a cloud mining company? You must be retarded.
@_date: 2014-11-05 04:14:25
You got the cryptos all figured out
1. Choose altcoin, mine altcoin, pump altcoin, sell altcoin 
2. Buy bitcoin, hold bitcoin, sell bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-11-05 03:56:38
Hashlet exists. They showed the photos of miners that are behind it. That's how cloud mining works.
@_date: 2014-11-27 03:39:44
The reason they have that many is none of them were scammed.

The car looks great and I think it's a great idea to promote BTC with it. I'd prefer a Tesla but this one is nice too.
@_date: 2014-11-05 17:50:42
Those empty boxes costed more than you make in 10 years, and that "warehouse" had some industrial AC units, so maybe it wasn't just a warehouse?
@_date: 2014-11-08 05:59:12
And some people keep asking for a receipt.
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:11:48
Similar to many Arab countries. Beer isn't popular there.

His opinion is the only right one, if you have a different one it means you  are paid or stupid. -_-
@_date: 2014-11-05 05:03:19
That Garza is buying everything, somebody stop him! :D 
@_date: 2014-11-05 04:11:47
They are also the owner of btc.com, a domain they bought for over 1 million USD and used to be the largest mining hardware supplier in the US, before they turned to cloud mining.
@_date: 2014-11-05 05:01:59
Where's the proof of scam? Show us all those scammed people please.
@_date: 2014-11-27 02:28:23
Do you have proof of this "ponzi" or are you just repeating with the crowd?
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:17:02
Nope, he had it before that from his previous companies and funding. If you thing GAW with its 3 data centers is just financed with Josh's money you must be really dumb.
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:18:13
Their data centers are not real too? They photoshopped the pictures and are not really mining :D 
@_date: 2014-11-01 01:38:26
What drugs are you on? They aren't a scam.
@_date: 2014-11-05 03:59:05
Karpeles never got arrested. Dream on.
@_date: 2014-08-21 15:04:41
This idiot already posted the same thing as zowieargh here and many different accounts on bitcointalk. Once a troll always a troll, but I have to say he's not even trying hard to find evidence just posts a lot of shit hoping people will fall for the trap and think: "hmm there's a lot of text maybe some of it is true" :D
@_date: 2014-11-05 03:59:46
@_date: 2014-11-05 18:04:48
Ignore the last 3 months. Bitcoin is still trading for $650! :D
Ignore the last rally and bitcoin is still worth more today than it was a year ago ;)

"There have, I believe, been a fair few people who’ve had difficulties with withdrawing their money."
They have a couple thousand clients, so a few people sounds completely normal.
Better ask how many of these people haven't been able to withdraw at all.
@_date: 2014-11-05 18:01:08
Use bitcoinwsidom then.
@_date: 2014-12-01 14:15:24
Spam, constant spam.
@_date: 2014-11-05 14:37:08
Tell us why you're so into attacking GAW and writing FUD about them.
All I see from you are acusations without proof. Somebody wrote a positive review about GAW &gt; they must have been bought! Such a pity this is the only explanation you can come up with. 
I'd love to know which cloud mining bought you :)
@_date: 2014-08-21 15:01:44
Complete and utter bullshit by a spammer and a troll. 
This guy used multiple accounts on bitcointall posing as jennak, df2k2, and now gaw_whistleblower :D You can find their newbie accounts on bitcointalk. 
He keeps repeating the same bullshit over and over again affraid to post any proof or reveal his identity. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 17:26:31
You're mostly telling them not to buy at GAW and troll their threads, so nobody misses your attitude.
Great proof you got there, someone's post has been deleted from Coindesk -&gt; they must be owned by GAW. Take a break, you'll get sick of all that hate.
@_date: 2014-11-25 13:38:25
Show me a legal altcoin that people register anywhere before the launch
@_date: 2014-11-07 13:25:37
An asshole is the place you came from.
@_date: 2014-11-25 13:51:18
Please prove that those twitter accounts you're talking about are "fake" and that their owners are "affiliated with GAW". Or is it another FUD?
@_date: 2014-12-01 13:58:45
Yeah "respectfully", every spammer and troll says that. Just like you are respectful in all your posts :D
@_date: 2014-11-05 03:58:00
They have all the legitimacy they need. No worries.
@_date: 2014-11-08 16:29:40
I'd say its a cultural thing, some countries like Like Iran for example have strict law. From wiki: "possession or distribution of any alcoholic beverages is illegal and punishable under Islamic law. Apart from that countries like Armenia or Azerbaijan have just 1 brewery, while in beer drinking countries like GB or Czech Republic they have over 30.
