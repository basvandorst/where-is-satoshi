Very clever! Enjoy your reward and thank you again!

Holy cow, you are right! I have no idea how I chose such a password or how you did it, but you've just earned $500! I'm gonna shoot you a PM immediately.
Out of curiosity, how did you do it?
Good work!

Basically, you can create a wallet here  and once logged in go to Settings -&gt; Addresses -&gt; Import Address, paste the private key in: 
It will ask you for the password - so you can try e.g. CLINTEASTWOOD and press import...it will compute for a while and then do nothing (if the pass was successful it would close the modal and probably show the imported address).
Another option is to download Mycelium app to your mobile phone and import address there - go to options, tap Cold Storage, and then "Get private key from: Clipboard". 
Both of these options are very slow, so I downloaded the bruteforce script and I'm feeding my guesses into that in a very ugly way.
Does anyone know a quicker way?
Btw. I tried CLINTEASTWOOD and CLinteastwood and a few other variations, but it's not that - but thanks!

Thanks for trying! Nah, I don't think so, I don't really have any favourite quote or movie with Clint or anything like that.
It's all quite strange because I remember creating three batches of paper wallets back then and the two other passwords work as expected - though they are totally unrelated. I usually use something that comes to my mind at random and has at least 10 characters or so. Writing "clinteastwood" as a clue for something different would be too complicated I guess.
I did write a clue on the sheet of paper itself however, so that I can distinuish it from the other two - it's "CL". Which might also mean "contactlist" or whatever (I tried that one though). But if it's something completely different than clinteastwood, then I guess I'm out of luck - and should maybe consider a hypnotist or something.

A bit lost here - what do you mean?
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:04:33
Hmm, interesting idea. Tried "doowtsaetnilc", didn't work, but at least I have something to think about. However, the two other passwords to other wallets I created that same day were not reversed.

Tried those now, no luck. I'll think about the movies, thanks!
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:33:47
haha, that's good to hear, thanks!

As I wrote, the public/private pair at the end of the post is for **another** paper wallet encrypted with the same BIP38 password.
The "real" wallet is the one I mentioned at the top of the post: 
I don't want to share the private key to the real address for obvious reasons.
