It was technical issue, you can withdraw now ...

Even bank network has much bigger reach in constrast with bitcoin, almost everybody has bank account and almost nobody has btc account. Barrier of high fees and usability issues will not help to change that. Also most of merchants will cancel btc support if there will be no future...
I am not even sure that we are in that stage where critical mass will accept this as "good enough" and will not leave to altcoin which will have instant payments, predictable and negligible fees and no political problems. Segwit(+LN) can largely help to keep users (and money) wanting to use btc as cash inside Bitcoin.

Payment was held due large payments bug. It was manualy executed two days after

Oh I am idiot, I've edited minrelaytxfee long time ago and forgot it.
@_date: 2017-03-11 19:02:03
It seems mempool is almost empty after long time 
@_date: 2017-03-25 08:06:23
There should be faster difficulty recalculation implemented also to be successful.
@_date: 2017-03-11 21:37:43
It seems Core 14 is ignoring and don't relay all tx with fee &lt;20s/b by default. Might be connected?
@_date: 2017-01-23 18:19:46
There is similar statistics at 
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:47:27
see nullc explanation 
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:33:15
Miners? You can easily check distance from coinbase tx. Click through other addresses in that transanctions, you will see same pattern, so no, it is not one person sending to others. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:32:44
You can contact your wallet provider. Unless significant amount of wallets or services will not switch fully to segwit we will not see any reduction soon. But I bet most devs are working on switch right now due incentives...
@_date: 2017-01-24 14:20:29
No. Sadly someone thinks that fee is staticaly set to 65s/b  ...positive side is that if you set fee to 66s/b it will go through...
@_date: 2016-11-23 19:36:24
Blockchain.info fee calculation is not changing even if network is congested...see  there are huge spikes around 55s/b and 65s/b(priority)
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:48:19
No problem. I am not saying that it is spam either... but it seems very suspicious.
@_date: 2016-11-25 12:51:53
No, there is not enough network resources to take every transaction in blockchain. Fees are actualy good way to make people think economical and not generate tousands of transactions just for fun (well, atleast not cheap fun). If you have limited resources and more people wants to use them then fees will go to the moon obviously. This will happen even with big blocks.
The only proper way to remove the resources limitation is to go offchain. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:46:16
I saw that but miner would screw this up by not unseting blockmaxsize. I would. And there is no edit.

Prague (and Czech Republic) is somewhat Bitcoin friendly. There is Bitcoin Coffe ( lot of bitcoins ATMs ( there is with his pool and TREZOR company...

Pushing agenda could be the reason but it attracts less people than making money. Almost everyone with enough money can do that...
@_date: 2016-12-02 08:33:23
Ok, please tell me where is the catch. Everytime when there is "spam" price go up.
@_date: 2016-11-22 07:37:43
There is lot of transactions with higher fees in mempool right now... 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:53:56
I use percentile from last 10 accepted blocks -
 see  - it is simple, most of time I use around 10-20 percentile for low prio transactions. For high prio or during turbolences it is better to use higher. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 15:43:55
Do you want to research the right fee amount everytime you send transaction? Thats just stupid.
@_date: 2016-11-15 07:29:41
I see SegWit =~ 90% hash rate (tested, working), Flexible Transactions =~ 0-10% hash rate (and actualy don't work yet). Simple math...
@_date: 2018-06-20 09:50:15
For understanding segwit tx structure there is very helpful explorer 
@_date: 2016-11-23 19:37:13
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:05:26
Thankfully this "problem" may be solved in future with Schnorr signatures where these tiny inputs are merged to one.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:39:48
Sure you can do that but it is now non trivial task because it requires you to calculate tx size with selected inputs...
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:25:27
- there is not native GUI as you say
- you need to use "addwitnessaddress" as additional step (which has its own problems 
- you can't generate sw return address unless you create raw tx
- no bech32
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:49:44
You forgot most important wallet - Bitcoin Core. Still no native segwit yet...
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:45:43
I think there is also fair number of bussinesses which utilize Core's RPC. For them it is just easier to just wait for stable seamless upgrade...
@_date: 2017-04-21 14:20:29


I would like to be wrong but I am afraid that there will never be "user voted" anything in Bitcoin because it would be easily gameable or unfair (pos). 


It is good enough to prevent attack, on loc it will clearly win. Anyway I don't think that this part is that important and will be subject of politics...
@_date: 2017-04-21 13:08:54
Thats rather political argument. I am with you with that one but I am more interested in technicalities because reddit is full of political posts...
@_date: 2017-04-21 13:49:59
Single BIP should not be solving all Bitcoin problems at once. Even SegWit doesn't solve block size problem to end of time...
@_date: 2017-04-21 13:44:36
Yes, I am thinking something like 95% to get stable network and preventing pushing smaller miners out of network. 
@_date: 2017-04-21 13:01:58
I don't think so - process of selecting size is clearly defined  AND it doesn't have flaws like EC have.
@_date: 2017-04-21 13:42:41
I don't even think it should solve more things to get wide adoption.
- it would be better to set supermajority as something like 95%, 75% definitely feels too low
- "Signature Hashing Operations Limits" part is somewhat limiting quadratic hashing problem isn't it?
@_date: 2017-04-21 12:54:08
True, that should be number one on list.
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:57:18
Cash blocks are not any faster than yesterday. It is also slow given the difficulty. There is something strange happening...
@_date: 2017-09-11 12:23:43
Who is the Bear he is mentioning around 18:00?
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:15:33
I guess that large portion of bussinesses depends on official core wallet which is right now not supporting segwit in native manner. Also right now, there is no fee pressure and nobody wants to break things which works well. I personaly will try to play with segwit with 0.15...

Nah. I've yesterday deployed v6 for large ISP but still coding btc apps earns me more...

Sure they are, but both are somewhat voluntary but inevitable upgrades
@_date: 2016-10-29 07:41:34
And large portion of that transactions are using fee almost 0 or 1 satoshi per byte, see: 
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:51:37
Aaha! 
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:17:18
Sure I am not saying that it is the same, but still there are lot of similarities
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:00:00
It is not new technology, it is good old nat or masquerade which is like cancer for networking. And it made almost imposible to create  truly global p2p applications. IPv6 is fixing it, but yeah it has its cost (another similarity...)
@_date: 2016-10-26 13:32:44
It seems that tousands of these transactions are being purged from mempool. Something smelly here
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:31:30
Well, you can say almost the same about IPv6. There was multiple competing standards. Also noone is required to "upgrade" to IPv6 but right now IPv4 address space became very expensive and can't do stuff which IPv6 do. Funny is that these extra features was also heavily criticized (we don't need them blah blah)... I can see a lot of similarities there
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:35:40
Technicaly Segwit is there also longer. Still its kind of sad for IPv6 and  extraordinary for segwit...
@_date: 2016-07-25 06:02:08
It depends what you are going to sell. For digital goods you can easily embed 
@_date: 2017-06-16 09:51:50
I agree, but transaction cost will lower in both cases - big blocks or segwit.
I pay a lot every day on fees with my little service. But still I think it is more than just stupid to push big blocks and fill them with microtransactions and coffees when there are solutions for on-chain optimizations, instant txs, anonymouse off-chain on the table without major rising node costs.
@_date: 2013-08-21 15:57:58
Some info about service
- instant payout, we dont "store" any bitcoins
- we dont track anything and you are anonymous (and service is not in US)
We are eager to add new features in near future :)
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:27:39
I will post some info about used tech if you would like...
@_date: 2017-06-16 08:02:17


You mean decentralization by decimating non-profit full nodes by rising their costs? Or huge number of people depending on third party? He cares primarily about his profit, maybe secondary about users count (fees), but surely as largest miner he don't give a fuck about decentralization.
@_date: 2013-08-21 17:36:58
It is not escrow. Its diferent service at all.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:14:23
There are many technologies used:
Serverside (PHP only):
- Symfony ( as portal framework
- Ratchet ( used for asynchronous realtime communication
Browser side:
- Twitter bootstrap (
- Autobahn js ( for communication with Ratchet
- Backbone js ( for models and view binding
- Buzz! ( html5 sounds
- lesscss, jquery...
This game was meant to learn something about gaming in browser and realtime communication. Lesson learned, it was very...very...hard to program and design this from end to end :)
