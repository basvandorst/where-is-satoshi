I tried using a Romit last month and it was black frozen screen. I asked the person in the shop and they said it was constantly dropping orders after Romit pushed its new software

LOL I hope this is a joke
@_date: 2015-06-18 20:23:45
Why is there no class action suit? or FTC compliant against these losers?
@_date: 2015-06-18 20:46:35
Serious question: Who is giving Robocoin/Romit more money? 
Jordan must be blowing these investors or something

Do you guys have bitlicense?
@_date: 2015-06-18 20:28:20
Agreed, how is it possible he is still involved? how can we get him out?
@_date: 2015-05-29 02:23:49
shhhhhh no need to let them know

I will now not be attend Miami BTC conference for this reason. Mainstream fraud and scams by prominent companies in this space has to stop for mainstream to take bitcoin seriously and adopt

These parasitic companies corrupt the core of bitcoin industry. Highlighting them to newcomers and the public at expos is very problematic and needs to be stopped despite the fact GAW helps pay the bills.

Yes round up karpeles, brewster, and jordan kelley and lets clean up bitcoin
@_date: 2015-08-01 21:13:41
And Jordan Kelley from Robocoin
@_date: 2015-08-01 21:13:12
Agreed! what is US waiting for
@_date: 2015-08-01 21:40:20
Agreed with Garza on the list. Disagree about Kelley. His fraud affected fewer victims (operators) so perhaps its not as visible to most but it is still fraud

The Gold Spike BTM has always worked for me. 10+ visits with no issues. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 06:02:30
12%? Is that at the D? I'm pretty sure Gold Spike is 5-7%. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 22:19:28
I would guess the author John Biggs and Jordan Kelley are fucking. Not kidding, look at his previous Robo articles. I can't think of any other reason any journalist would continue to cover this company at this point. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 12:48:24
Whatever you do... stay as far away from Robocoin as you can
@_date: 2015-02-14 13:09:17
They can't get there software to work on their own BTMs and won't even give customer support. 
Who would ever want to use it on another ATM? Or even trust the joke of a company?

Fraud and Robocoin: 'Like peanut butter and jelly'
@_date: 2015-02-15 23:21:45
Anybody get a response from ATMIA?
