With VISA you can also get cheap credit, another reason to leave bitcoin where you really need to own the money you want to spend.

Define problem.
They can just gauge the percentage of chargeback scams and any other CC scam for that matter and incorporate this information in their fee structure.
Just as with insurance companies, your fees partly pay everyone who gets scammed, while at the same time insuring yourself from harm.

Yes to me it sounds terrible. Of course you can buy a lot with your CC, I never denied that. (Although your percentages are probably without viable source so I'm not even going to ask.)
What I want is more freedom, more privacy and less dependency. You won't get that by using financial intermediaries wherever you go. They know how much money you got, what you like to buy, etc - and they can take it all away on a whim.
Essentially you are giving away a lot of control to some multinational profit-oriented corporation, and I can guarantee you their first priority is their own well-being and not yours.

From what I could gather Invictus (the "company" behind bitshares, protoshares, angelshares and whatnot) is just shady. I read their "prospectus" and whatever else was available on their homepage, and I didn't like it. Now their website is pretty much gone anyway (weird.)
It's just like 99% of all other altcoins, they were created to make their creators rich. While not a classic pyramid scheme, it comes pretty close. Marketing and rebranding do their job of luring suckers in, you can invest and whatnot, the full program. But where is the real value? Can you do anything with them but wait for their value to increase and sell them to the next sucker?
In the end it doesn't make sense to trade pegged derivatives, you can just trade the real thing on a real exchange. I just don't see any value in Bitshares.
Who knows, maybe I'm wrong. I'm opting out anyways.
-&gt; a truly decentralized exchange would be something beautiful though!

the network effect being meaningless is a contradiction in itself. there either is an effect, or there isn't. how is bitcoin still dominating crypto, if there is no network effect? there are enough clones out already, how come their market cap is just a fraction of the bitcoin market cap?

Without the internet big parts of our economy would just collapse, and the USD with it, so I don't think anyone is thinking about cutting any cables. 
They could try cordoning off sections of the internet, but I doubt this could really stop bitcoin or the technology behind it.
@_date: 2014-12-17 14:18:33
We just move forward.
You need to understand: market price doesn't really matter that much. As long as there is enough liquidity for me to move $1000 around the globe via BTC, it has some value to me. Whether I use one or four coins for that, who cares.
The sooner people grasp this concept, the better. Usage is what matters. Good news are most likely fueling this process, but it could still take years. 
In the meantime, just teach your friends and family how to use bitcoin risk-free, that is to utilize bitcoin for payments instead of putting your savings in it. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 20:39:38
Even if bitcoin is outlawed, this is still possible.
You can't really stop people from using bitcoin, that's the beauty of it.
By banning bitcoin, they are just delaying the inevitable so they can abuse the current financial system a little longer (see comment above)

To buy something with bitcoin, those people first would have to acquire said coins, so this selling pressure argument is kinda moot.

If you knew that for sure, you could make a lot of money by putting your money where your mouth is and shorting BTC.

@_date: 2014-12-17 16:21:01
You can buy a coin right now for $325, no need for the price to get higher, there are coins being sold right now.
You people are talking as if Bitcoin isn't really "here" until you've made a million $$$ out of your 0.5 BTC. Well let me say it again: Bitcoin is here, you can buy coins right now, you can use them right now, you can do whatever the hell you please with them, right now.

I like your strategy.
At some point some guys who sold are going to want to get back on the train, but they might have to pay a premium as the coins they sold are now getting stashed in those hodling vaults.
This downward pressure can't hold for too long, otherwise I'll own all available coins soon.

You could short bitcoin into oblivion and get incredibly rich. What is stopping you, it's a free market after all. 
Why are you even here in the first place?
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:54:08
Remittance is working, maybe not perfectly for now but it's one of the things where bitcoin really is going to take over, whether you like it or not.
Your bank account is about as free as your credit card, it makes you a pawn, a serf, a sheep, a worker, a debtslave. Go ahead put your savings in the bank.
I have no motivation to write much more as I think you're a lost cause.
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:03:58
Sorry but you are mixing up a number of different market effects into one big FUD story.
How did Bitcoin survive the first year if mining won't work on a smaller scale?
TPTB have ways to suppress BTC price but it's extremely expensive if price would naturally go the other direction. 
They would make a lot of people very rich up to the point where they can't afford to hold it down any longer. Markets are pretty effective most of the time.
Some miners might drop out with falling prices, but with falling difficulty they might come back in.
In the end you can also think about it this way: If they really find a way to break bitcoin there will instantly be an altcoin which is somehow immune to the thing that killed bitcoin. It's like a hydra.
That's why it won't really be feasible to try that. They could just jump on the train and try to get a huge amount of bitcoin, then control price somewhat with their huge reserve of coins. This is way easier to accomplish and would make them very rich instead of costing them a lot.

He seemed quite sure about bitcoins demise to me, well maybe I erred.
What he didn't do was point out any flaws. He said there are no use cases which is just plain wrong. Many people are using bitcoin as we speak. Just try and show me a single flaw in the code and I will shut up.

What if you're one of those bad actors, trying to instill doubt and mistrust in and within the core dev group? Creating posts to make people paranoid?
I don't think it's feasible to insert malicious devs, as everything is open source. 
I do think they started attacking bitcoin via negative media coverage a long time ago, making people think about drugs, hackers and scams when they read the word bitcoin. Which is enough to slow down growth comfortably, even though the US Dollar is way more popular with drug dealers, hackers and scammers.
People are still telling me bitcoin is a ponzi while central banks inflate away their life savings. Mind control baby.
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:26:29
What is your problem? There is enough purpose already and more in the works:
1. Remittance (cheaper than currently available)
2. Storage of value (outside of anyones control but your own)
3. Financial transactions for the unbanked
4. Financial transactions for everyone who realizes how banks rip them off all day err' day (even after you're dead)
5. Colored coins / electronic IOU
And that's just the start.
There might be a shortage of demand right now, but with time all those services will establish themselves and grow bitcoins purpose. 
You're thinking along the lines of "Why would I need the internet? I can get a real encyclopedia and send letters via the mail, who needs wikipedia and email?"

There can be non-tradeable things which still have value. Let's say a season ticket or a $50 store coupon with your name on it. Not too many things come to mind though.

It doesn't cost that much to get bitcoin, I got some for 0.5% fee at Bitstamp. Converting your USD to EUR is probably more expensive than converting to BTC.
If you _insist_ on buying at a BTM, you'll have to accept their rates. Otherwise it would be like selling gold at a pawn shop and expecting them to pay the current spot price - nothing short of insanity.

@_date: 2015-01-31 12:10:48
You are missing the point. Early investors took all the risk, therefore their reward might be proportionally higher.
Today there are a lot of services around bitcoin and no flaw in the protocol managed to bring down the system yet. It's anti-fragile nature holds strong. 
But who was to know it would last 6 years or longer? Who was to say it wouldn't collapse somewhere along the way?
It was a risky investment in the early days and it still is risky, but today the bitcoin ecosystem is already somewhat matured and therefore your risk premium might be a little less.
(Personally I think it's still going to be outrageously profitable, even if you didn't invest "early". Also, who's to say it's not "early" still?)
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:37:50
The beauty of bitcoin is how it automatically adjusts to an increase/decrease in miners/hashrate.
You would have to fundamentally disagree with the way bitcoin works if you think it can break and die from a drop in price.
What kind of amateurish algorithm would that have to be?

I never got why you would even need banks for that.
A bank is just a middleman, if your fridge could directly pay for your groceries (trustless, secure, fast), why would you want a bank in there?
By going through banks you directly hand over a lot of power. Now they can seize your funds, analyze your grocery buying behaviour and sell the data, take a % fee of each transaction. They could even start blacklisting grocery vendors they don't like.
So yes, if banks made some changes they could also let your fridge buy groceries, but at what cost? It's ridiculous.

Thank you.
To me it seems the issue is not security, as Bitcoin is inherently secure, but paranoia, fear and doubt. Somehow having full control, but at the same time also having full responsibility for their own funds makes people uneasy. They like trusting some "bigger" institution like a bank, which of course has some "guarantees" about keeping your money safe, but in the event of a global crisis those guarantees might disappear quicker than people think. 
Bitcoin won't give those guarantees and that needs some getting used to. Responsibility is a weird thing.
I think the trezor is a step in the right direction. Hardware wallets and physical solutions like those stamped metal plates will help consumers to secure their funds more easily. 
Also, try securing any amount of fiat cash with a 12 word mnemonic phrase, while being available to send any fraction of it around the world, nearly free. It won't work, your cash will not move anywhere and you will never be able to sufficiently secure it with your head or any small USB device, you won't even be able to give half of your 1 dollar note to anyone without physically destroying it in the process. You would need a safe or a bank.
@_date: 2015-03-08 17:25:11
You seem awfully sure of how the future is going to play out.
There's a million things differentiating Bitcoin from all the currently employed (and inherently broken) systems, if you decide to overlook them that's on you. 
What you call "regular users" will come around at some point, just as they did with Google, Facebook, smartphones, and everything else. Will they ever have to understand the inner workings of bitcoin or even take a look at a real public/private key? Maybe not. Will they still use bitcoin via some smartphone app? Most likely.
Most people never had to learn jack shit about HTTP either, and they still use it on a daily basis. Today three year old kids play games on their ipads, a generation that's probably already using applepay, for them grasping digital currency won't be that big of a hurdle. The stubborn old guard still hating on e-mail is just going to disappear with time. Life is beautiful.
The mainstream can turn around and embrace something just as quick as it dismissed it in the first place, just give it some time. Until then, feel free to make some money with your fortune telling skills (take any derivatives market and let it rip)
