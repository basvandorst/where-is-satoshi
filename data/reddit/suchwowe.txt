My friend sent 0.01 back in October and never received his funds. Contacted Microsoft support who have looked into the situation abut were unable to give microsoft points or refund his payment. Any one have this problem too? I told him to contact bitpay

My friend used bitpay for microsoft and is in a similar situation would love to know a resolution.

Maybe you should listen to his story again. Not just the popular media Hollywood story.  Maybe if the movie and newspapers talk about the rest of his life you wouldn’t be so ignorant to call him just a con artist. 
He made a mistake as a young man. He was a run away after his parents divorce. From 15-21 years old he committed fraud.  After serving five years for his crime he started working for the US government. 26-62 years old he worked alongside the US government helping and serving his country.  Working against crimes probably longer than you’ve been alive. This is not your common criminal con artist. This man has developed many counter fraud technology. Working alongside the government he has some pretty strong opinions.

Would he be giving you some of the profit if it went up?  Did he give you $200 for 0.015 and now feels regret? Why does he want $200 in bitcoin and not cash?  He should have $48 left.   It's a long term investment that requires learning and patience. If he wants to be miserable everyday let him.  
@_date: 2019-01-16 19:32:33
That's what I think when people say they're waiting for 1k. Either they don't have the money or aren't really planning to invest over 10k. If this was March 2015 you would've had to purchase 56k worth to cash out 1 million today. You would also have to hold through the 100%+ gains. People treated it way more risky then they do today. Love ones &amp; friends telling you its a scam. I do feel the majority of people today do see bitcoin as risky but don't understand that it works.

We did ask for steady growth 
@_date: 2018-04-23 12:49:44
I’m guessing because of the fork coming up that people are buying. 
@_date: 2019-09-24 14:15:39
We are strong and never scared.
@_date: 2018-07-22 19:59:15
Im questioning if big investors buying up the limited supply with the intent of keeping the price low. Buy low sell high duh. But what’s  stopping buffet/banks from spreading fud to sell or keep others from buying? They’re going to fight back and the best way is from the inside. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:16:24
Yeah, you’re getting upset by other’s opinions that don’t matter to you.

Goes up a 100 it’s a pump goes down a 100 it’s dump. It’s that simple....
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:23:27
It might hold if I keep buying 
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:38:11
People who wake up and sell right away are going to have a bad time. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:28:20
It’s wishing dude relax didn’t mean to piss you off.  You don’t know it could be 6k next week....
Nobody knows what they’re talking about when it comes to predictions. My comment is poking to the user who been posting “ 10k never again” in this discussion. I believe it be over 10k again but I don’t know when exactly but I have an idea and opinion. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:25:01
I feel it

I’ve been watching the halving clock and it’s moved about 5 days.

4/20 let’s see bitcoin get high 
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:06:20
Um no
@_date: 2018-04-13 00:19:33
I feel that green dildo 
@_date: 2018-04-03 12:15:26
Now that the dip is gone I’m glad I bought it. Haven’t seen that 10k never again guy in a while.  We’re probably heading past that in the next couple of days. Still good buying opportunity. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:37:37
Thought we were done with this 4k, 5k bottom talk. Last week it was every other comment. The last two days have been quiet.  It was nice. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:05:39
Probably 
@_date: 2018-04-14 12:47:46
Buying on the low

Thanks Jesus

Can you buy bitcoin instantly? But you have to put in your ssn.
@_date: 2018-04-10 22:12:36
I’m smoking again 
@_date: 2018-04-07 02:58:00
No that is exciting 
@_date: 2018-04-01 19:27:45
I think its too late for some people to buy back in at the price they wanted. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:02:43
I don’t get how you can make a prediction that it could be 6k next week...

This happens to to almost every person gambling but the house eventually gets you. Glad to see you were 16 and learned this early

Same here. I think if you can do it and make the monthly payment go for it.

Money is money and the cash sitting in the bank has a nice 0% interest. Worst comes to worst I spend the bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:31:21
Thank you for that explanation
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:09:14
Damn because now is a pretty good time. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 12:42:20
It varies, and I understand 5-7 days is an estimate. However, USD was withdrawn from my bank account in three days and I had deposited btc the same day. To help the picture, my purchases from 6/3 didn't go through but my purchase from 6/6 went through 6/10. Both were bank deposits. That's a flaw since it's been over 7 days. If you buy low and there's a jump they'll take their time getting your coins. I also remember coinbase doing this in the past and one of the reason I chose circle.  Trying to inform my experience with coinbase and maybe someone else is waiting an extra amount of time. So clearly assume everything.

What’s Fibonacci saying about this?
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:57:09
Pretty sure you called bitcoin a shitcoin a couple hours ago; that’s an insult.  Process that for minute with everything you’ve been saying. What about bitcoin is shit? 
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:08:21
The app is working 
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:10:14
What how to did you use?
@_date: 2017-06-16 02:01:43
Yes, some graphic designers did and there was a subreddit I believe.
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:53:47
I guess you have your reasons. Is 1k a reasonable buy price for you? 
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:42:05
I had a dream the exchanges closed in my region and I had to run away.
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:26:12
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:10:37
Circle was the best instant buy and sell
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:51:51
I kept rebooting the app eventually I was able to get that up and purchase.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:08:03
Worth it!
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:16:46
It's taking a full exact 7 days to get my coins
@_date: 2017-06-29 03:23:05
What Indian paper is that?
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:04:49
Just went through give it time it eventually will. It still seems they went over a few of my buys and started processing more recent transactions. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:36:53
I feel like the price is being driven down this last week so everyone can buy up before the July surge. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:03:39
Yes and yes. The fees were about 8-16%. The more information about yourself you put the lower the fee. I like that coinbase locks in the buy but the limit is low. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:10:00
Scam 
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:37:01
Lots of buy orders waiting below. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:53:08
I'm interested as well. What services do they use
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:06:22
13.86 and still adding probably spent around 50 tho 
@_date: 2018-12-13 22:58:06
You’re personally insulting the community with your baseless predictions and wave riding. 
If you’re so concrete on 1k you would sell your hodlings. You not selling shows you’re afraid of missing out. Anybody willing to hold through 1k isn’t coming here to bash everybody.  Anybody calling 1k is selling to rebuy. That’s the strategy. Your strategy is to hodl and pray for a lower price? I think you just feel unlucky so your calling the opposite. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:51:50
Same here have 0.01 pending for over an hour. Two buys from 6/3 didn't go through let but 6/4 went through?
