That's a good point. But some people argue that bitcoin is going to replace the monetary system but if no one knows what is it/doesn't accept it then it's not gonna happen anytime soon

It remembers me what happened to bitcoin when people discovered that mt.gox was only a bunch of bots trading with each other.

I was in the same boat and after reading this I did the basic verification (just got a code sent to my phone  and now I have 3 BTC withdrawal limit. This is very simple. You don't have to complain about this simple process

Open a ticket and LBc will help you thru this. Also call your bank and ask for a chargeback. Lbc support is pretty good. They probably will block his coins/account. Do it as fast as you can
