How do people still not understand that advertising they own any amount of cryptos is making them into a target for hackers/ scammers/ gangsters/ grifters/ Nigerian princes / meth heads/ or any other form of lowlife who thinks they can outsmart or out- muscle you away from your investments. "Be your own bank" also comes with, be your own security company. Stay safe people.

Would you do this with cash?
@_date: 2019-08-25 00:11:08
Yep scam. But good thing you did your own research and good of you to post it here so others will be aware of it. You could also post it on r/bitcoinbeginners. Always be wary of anyone trying to private message you.

Check the FAQs on crypto subs first, r/bitcoinbeginners is a good place to start. Most of your questions will already be there. Don't accept Private Messages of help or advice.
@_date: 2019-10-03 07:52:40
DON'T PRIVATE MESSAGE ANYONE!!!!

Oh dear. Wait for Kochie to mention it and then sell everything.
@_date: 2019-06-27 12:57:17
Don't focus on the price, you'll just get caught up in the hype (FOMO) and you will make poor choices. Buy small amounts (only what you can afford to lose) regularly, regardless of the price. DCA Dollar Cost Averaging has proven to be one of the best ways to invest while keeping your costs down.  
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:53:19
Umm. That's not "investing", that's gambling. You'll get REKT.

Welcome to the rabbit hole. Reddit is a good place to ask questions but always Do Your Own Research (DYOR) before you spend your own hard earned money. People will disagree with me but I find Exodus is a good multi- currency for small amounts or even the blockchain wallet itself (just to get started). Learn as much as you can (because it can be easy to make mistakes) and send small transactions first to check that you have got it right. There's a lot to learn about this space, so do a lot of homework before you invest. Good luck.

Don't rely on god to stop you smoking. It's an unreliable strategy. If you really want to quit then just try to change your mind. Tell yourself that you are really looking forward to being a non-smoker. Tell yourself that you are really looking forward to quitting. And when you've finished thst last smoke you can reward yourself by not dying a slow painful miserable death. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 19:57:26
