Haha, even in the understanding is extremely flawed. They know all the terms, and all of a sudden, they're experts. The seem to use "painting the tape" and "pump and dump" interchangeably. Oh, and absolutely everything is market manipulation.

He did an interview on BBC's HARDtalk not that long ago. Until then, I had made prejudiced assumptions about him; essentially that he was a typical American gun nut with delusional ideas of freedom.
Despite the grilling from Sackur, he really presented himself quite well, and turned me around to the statement he was really trying to make.
That's the link, but only available from UK IP address.

Indeed, someone close who is or was close to Dorian, and has worked on siliar things and in similar places. That way, if anyone ever manages to sniff around get close to the real Satoshi, he can throw Dorian under the bus as a similar candidate.
Furthermore, Satoshi may have some dirt on Dorian that he is blackmailing him with. As such, Dorian and his family are forced to entertain the media with the notion that he might be the real Satoshi, should the time come to it.

Unless they are trying to obscure where they are really from...

Hi I know this post is rather old now, but I was wondering does Bitstamp still operate in this way, or has their documentation improved? Unfortunately I am not well versed enough on this subject to determine for myself, but was just curious as to whether the state of affairs has improved.

Just one of those articles would be fine.

SO someone is ahead of us all!
Trading by making "crossed over" limit orders in the book seems to be the safest way to me. But I have felt that the likes of BitcoinWisdom are a bit delayed in displaying changes, and in search of real time data, I came across your post.
It feels like a steep curve to learn how to use APIs effectively but I must give it a go if I don't want to be behind the curve. Trade carefully I will, especially with this talk of coin validation on stamp...
Thanks very much for the reply.

Of course, it is a fine line that separates them. Over there they will see a huge market buy order, that eats deep into offer stack. Even if the vacuum is never filled, and the price drops immediately to where it was, causing no overall discernible movement, the big candles will make them say "Market manipulation, big pump and dump!".
If you do go there, prepare to cringe at some of the remarks and theories.

But those celebrities/wealthy individuals often *do* have a reasonable amount of security surrounding their homes. It sounds like this guy has been leading a humble existence, with his mother, in a minimally secured home.

Even at that, I would say most of the interesting events of this saga happened in front of a computer. And while I cannot deny that this is all very fascinating, it lends itself to a book more than a movie.
Perhaps the best way for a movie to be made is from the perspective of the police investigation, with DPR being some sort of enigma until the end.

Even if that is the case, this article is not speculating on the trading of bitcoins on exchanges. It is making an argument about the fundamentals of bitcoins and its long term prospects. Whether you agree with these arguments or not, this is the place for it to be discussed.
