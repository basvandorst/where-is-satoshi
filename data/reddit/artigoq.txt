Good article came out recently on why owning 5-10 bitcoins will be life changing type of wealth.  I tend to agree.  So imo even 1 whole coin will be a nice payday to your future self/family.

You said it so I assume you agree with it.  Now, why 'should' you diversify?  Because if one asset tanks you dont want to lose 100% value on all of your money. So you spread risk across less correlated assets.
Well what if there was an asset uncorrelated with every standard asset class?

I mean if it's IMMEDIATELY after whatever black swan event then yea there other needs much more important.  However, when society inevitably stabilizes... what do you think people would use to store value if primary consumption was mostly perishable goods?

And weve hit higher lows and increased volume every year.  The term "critical mass" comes to mind.
The nano second that mass is achieved no amount of whales could stop the flood. Although, theyve probably known for years and are positioning for that to happen.  Whether it's sooner or later is irrelevant.

Honestly, what veteran of the space doesnt know this already?  At this point, I'm completely unphased by the drop.  Only difference now is I can stack more sats for the same price.

Has anyone actually traded BTC for bolivars?  Cant imagine anyone would want to actually do that.

Makes sense.  Thanks for the reply.  Pretty neat to see it being used by people in need.

I hope so.  Need some more sats before we go parabolic again

How can a bank "adopt" a decentralized, non-soverign, digital asset with hardcap supply?  Store it? Maybe, but if you think a large financial institution will ever actually USE bitcoin I've got a bridge to sell you.

As are all assets, except BTC is a much smaller market cap so less money is able to shift more.
However, dont see my VTSAX shares ever 5x'ing in value.

I feel like this might back fire for China.  They want to make a centralized digital currency, but imagine enough people learn about crypto and realize the greater truth.
Cant imagine CCP would like to see a bunch of capital flight into bitcoin.

Someone took out a mortgage to buy at 19,5k
If/when we cross that number again I have no doubt in the power of greed + fomo for that to happen again.  For every one person that happened to there tens of millions who have never even considered bitcoin.
If just 1% or even a half % of people start buying bitcoin is it so crazy a stretch to see another run up?

As insurance against irresponsible fiscal and monetary policy? Absolutely.

I've handled one (that I know of) in my life while working POS at a large department store.  It was spot on except for the water mark.  Jackson's face in the water mark was a lot more scrunched up.  Kind of funny to see.

Ever?  Well that's an achievement.
Its not quite on the same level, but the idea of a non-soverign, hardcap supply, digital store of value, insurance against irresponsible fiscal/monetary policy, and uncorrelated to every other financial asset - is pretty ground breaking.  Could peter out or take off.
I'm betting it takes off.

Even better question, why are you so sure they havent?
The price may have dropped, but the total number of addresses with 100+ btc has **never** decreased only increased over time.
The coins in circulation are mostly traded between addresses with thousands and the the fractions that are bought by us.
More btc are being hodl'd than ever before, but there is enough volume that that the price stays relatively stable.  We dont know who has them, but if a high wealth person is diversifying 
1) they aren't going to disclose 
2) they probably dont day trade (hence being a high wealth individual)

I'm in a similar boat to you.  I was fortunate to accumulate a few bitcoin in 2015-2016, but not enough. I will keep buying btc until we hit 100k then get that house.
Good luck fam

Jesus.  For what purpose?
@_date: 2019-09-26 19:18:24
I think it depends on how old you are, no? I have a good bit over 10%, mostly accidental from my early purchases increasing in value since 2015, but despite that I'd argue that because it could be worth it in the long run and with X number of years left to recoup it's not such a bad idea.
@_date: 2019-09-23 21:24:31
lol people call tops and bottoms all the time.  I bought my first btc in jan of 2015 so at this point unless it goes to 0 I do not care.

Considering they have trillions in assets they can definitely afford a large fraction of the supply.
Question is how long have they been accumulating?
@_date: 2019-09-17 17:26:13
We 5x'd after hitting 3k in a span of a few months with no news and no hype.  Only a matter of time until were hitting new ATHs.

My question is why is there a liquidity shortfall? Has there been more loans than predicted?
