I actually find your obsession with my potential affinity for Trump humorous.

Bitcoin doesn’t give a shit about J.P. Morgan, the US Customs, Drugz,or  TeRorizm.

The point is bitcoin itself is a better store of value for large sums  than negative yielding bonds.

I actually find your obsession with my potential affinity for Trump humorous.. When you actually have no clue.

I don’t have a problem with your opinion of what he could of have done otherwise. It is labeling me as having certain opinions,, when I don’t that is inappropriate. I do happen to agree that he could have not opined, but I believe there is real consternation forming about what a distributed value system could do to the power of government’s ability to tax and print money.

I agree with that to certain extent actually, I think the Govt and Fed are feeling threatened. For good reason.

Kinda like the US vs Grenada
@_date: 2019-03-22 18:48:34
Just for a limited time. If the price is very volitile vs fiat it is not practical to use as a medium of exchange.

I doubt if  would sign it. If you are from TX send him a nice tweet and let him know how you feel.

I think you mean “Carbon dioxide footprint.” Calling  “carbon dioxide” by the politically charged misnomer of “carbon” is like calling water (H2O) “hydrogen.” Carbon is a dirty black element, while carbon dioxide is a clear odorless gas.

Bitcoin doesn’t care what the price is. The value is in the network which keeps getting stronger.

A great aspect of bitcoin is there is no judgement except whether a transaction is valid. No need for politics.
@_date: 2019-05-28 08:30:24
The good thing is bitcoin doesn’t care about your politics.

One of the reasons for bitcoin is to avoid the moral hazard of interfering with free markets. It would be a bad idea.
