Literally learned this in 8th grade economics. If the comments here are any indication of the level of education of the typical crypto investor....were all fucked.

I believe it was Hal and only Hal, as transactions from Satoshi's wallet stopped after he passed.
If I'm wrong about this please correct me.

Lol I got the same exact message. That account isnt even 3 months old. Ive been here since before bcash was even a twinkle in bitcoin's eye.
@_date: 2018-05-27 21:08:05
Of course, go for it, see if it catches on. Probably not, since "bitcoin" is more ubiquitous, as well as the same number of syllables than that nonsense, but hey you do you buddy.

Dont feed the troll. Hes probably just upset he didnt get in at 1k. Or 5k. Or even 10k.
Dude probably bought in at like 20k and is pissed that his $100 investment is now worth $40.

Objectively, it has less syllables and letters than the other way, therefore its just easier to say and write "bcash."  Its so easy, ill even say it again - bcash.

Everyone knows on that date hes just gonna buy 1 sat at $.01 and then point to that to say "SEE LOOK BTC HIT $1MM I DONT HAVE TO EAT MY DICK NOW LEAVE ME ALONE I HAVE HOOKERS WAITING TO SHIT ON ME."

Reported you for blind stupidity. This is a legit discussion question.

Allegedly cremated. But I bet theres a receipt for a fake moustache floating around somewhere.
@_date: 2019-02-07 21:33:22
Yeah because you'd totally have to do that with bitcoin.

Some people also lost big time who bought Amazon stock in the late 90s. Just imagine if they still hold that stock today.

With that logic, a lot of merchants are also avoiding crypto as a valid payment.
@_date: 2019-12-15 19:19:22
Probably unaware of the fact that you could have also bought around $3k at the beginning of the year, but yeah I still agree with the claim that its a better investment than paper money and the FED.

Lol youre the one who started the caps-ing.
Just chill the fuck out, youll have a much more enjoyable life. 
Someone posts a rational response with caps FOR EMPHASIS, and you melt down. Grow up.

Gonna need a link homie
@_date: 2018-04-22 23:12:27
Yeah, we might wanna workshop that one a little bit
@_date: 2018-04-07 03:50:29
Yeah yeah I remember people saying the same thing in 2014 and look where.....
*checks cmc*
@_date: 2019-05-26 16:27:55
Sure, if we drop the "s."
@_date: 2018-12-28 09:52:13
I agree its similar reasoning, the difference being though that in a pyramid scheme, a single person can only be connected to the network one time and one time only. Each "node" in this scenario can have many different connections to the network through many different nodes.
