I'm new to Bitcoin world but I can tell you this:
We have few cryptocurrencies exchanges, and they have traffic. I personally know few people who own Bitcoins, but I don't think that adoption is wide.
In Ukraine we have large networks of street cash-in machines. You can use them to put money on your bank account, pay invoices or top your cellular or internet accounts. Some of them even sell you Bitcoins for cash. This service has some sort of partner program with one of the banks. You can use it to convert your Bitcoins in UAH and put it on debit card issued by this bank. I wonder how this service operators will react to NBU statement.
And thanks for the tip!

Just got a tip in this topic. Tipping to back to the community 20 bits @_date: 2014-11-11 15:38:13
Internet censorship is virtually non-existent in Ukraine. It has its downsides like Russian propaganda web-sites that operate freely or high levels of piracy. But in the end no censorship is good thing, one of the few things Ukraine can be proud of. Things are a bit worse in TV and press, because large media outlets are owned by rich people that have positions in government. So their representation of facts is skewed.
Maybe you've read about "Black Thursday". On 16th of January parliament had passed and Yanukovych have signed so called "dictatorship laws". They were targeting freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. And these laws also gave government the right to shutdown any website or restrict Internet access without any due process. Just on a whim. For me it was the scariest part of that package. These laws had sparked the most violent protest on Maidan and were canceled on 28th of January. So the Internet and media are as free as they were before the war.
@_date: 2014-11-10 18:46:08
Thanks, I'll have one!

I'm not a specialist in the field, but things are bad. Currency loses its value, prices are going up (to as fast as currency goes down, but still). But this happened not once in last 20 years, and we're still here, so I'm somewhat optimistic. On a plus side we've got a preferential trade agreement with the EU for one year. We can sell our goods there with lower custom dues, but we can set any tolls for their goods imported in Ukraine. 
The war is too expensive for today Ukraine. Too much money is spent on it and on internally displaced persons, who had to fled conflict area. Too much, but no nearly enough to fully supply military and police, or to provide as much help for IDPs as they need. There are many volunteer movements through the country who supply armed forces and help IDPs to adjust at their new homes.
I think that next six month will be crucial. We had elected new parliament. If new parliament prove itself better than last one and we survive the winter, I'll think (or hope) that things will get better.

Тут важно помнить, что НБУ не законодательный, а регуляторный орган. Они не могут ничего запретить сами по себе. Например, я, как гражданин Украины, не должен открывать счетов зарубежем, не уведомив НБУ. Но, с другой стороны, если я это сделаю, мне за это ничего не будет. Так и здесь, то что граждане и бизнес должны оперировать только гривной (кроме внешнеэкономической деятельности), так это так всегда было. Закона об электронных деньгах у нас до сих пор нет толком. У нас и Вебмани с Пейпалом в правовом вакууме.

I personally know three persons who own any amount of BTC. Maybe not everybody shared that info and there are more Bitcoin owners in my circle. (edit: I do not know how to extrapolate this to the country scale, but there are online forums and exchanges, so I think this is "a few" in the end.)
I know two Ukrainian cryptocurrency exchanges, but I suspect there are more than that.
As for cash-in machines, the company that operates them says it's more than 4000 all over the country. I can't confirm that obviously, but machine near may home does have that option. Never tried it.

My opinion on the war is simple: it's bad. I really wish Russia to stop to supply separatists with arms, troops and money, so it can end sooner in political process, not the armed conflict.
I think it doesn't affect Bitcoin trade in direct manner. The region were war takes place was most imbalanced. The few rich there were too rich, and the poor were too poor. So the former doesn't bother with Bitcoin (and fled that region anyway) and the later would be happy to have any money.
Indirectly the war affects trade of course. BTC prices are set to USD, and UAH is loosing its cost everyday. So BTC to UAH rates are going up as well. And whole sense of instability doesn't help any market.

1. If you look in the official census data, majority identify themselves as Ukrainians. Often it hasn't anything to do with ethnicity though. I'm myself not an ethnic Ukrainian but I consider myself Ukrainian as in "citizen of Ukraine" or part of the nation.
2. Yes. 99% of people here understand Ukrainian. Most of people can speak it. I know Ukrainian, I perfectly understand it, but I rarely speak it, so it is hard to find right words sometimes and Russian words get mixed with Ukrainian. This problem usually go away after few minutes. The same goes for Ukrainian speaking regions. Everyone there understands Russian and most people speak Russian without any trouble, except for mixing Ukrainian words in Russian sentences. In some rural areas people speak so called "Surzhyk" - the strange amalgamation of Russian and Ukrainian languages.

1) No, you can set prices in BTC if you state that it is "relative units" and state cost of this unit in UAH. I'm not sure maybe you can accept BTC if you immediately convert them to UAH for bookkeeping and taxes. But this is thin ice and I do not have enough expertise in this. Law says you should only accept UAH.
2) Yes. Strictly saying it is not forbidden.
3) Yes, exactly right.

No, you cannot barter. When someone wants to barter they just sell things to each other for 0.01 UAH. When selling house, because you have to pay a tax, price will be valued by government entity, so this 0.01 UAH trick shouldn't work in that case.
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:49:26
I do not think it would be that bad for Russia, they have their own agricultural regions (Black-Earth regions), so it mostly political.
I know that Ukraine wants to sell goods to Russia. Ukraine produces enough to trade both sides. And EU has more strict standards, so Russia may have broader market for us for a few more years, until we upgrade our own standards. Official argument from Russia is that European goods could be imported through Ukraine to Russia and thus hurt local Russian producers. But as I said, the real reason is political influence. Russia want Ukraine to depended of their market. For last few years we were 'punished' not once with import bans for their side, when Russia didn't like our political course.

And you cannot use anything except for UAH as a payment method. Doesn't mean its banned, though. You can buy USD, you can own USD, you can sell USD, but you cannot pay with USD. Same with the BTC, but its even isn't a currency as far as the law concerned. If NBU views it as money-substitute it doesn't automatically means that the law states that. NBU doesn't write laws, so if it will want to argue that BTC breaks the law it'll have to go to court in every case. So, until the new law on electronic money is written everything is the same as it was yesterday. And we need this law badly, even PayPal cannot operate in full mode here without it. We just need to be sure they wouldn't put something stupid, like actual BTC ban, in this law.

As far as I know (I have few contacts there) those who really wanted to be in Russia are still euphoric. More moderate persons hate higher prices and fewer tourists numbers.

In enforced in a sense, that if you'll be caught be hand selling something for the foreign currency there'll be consequences. But if you list price in "relative units" (USD or EUR) and all final transactions are made in UAH by current rate everything is ok. I cannot see why BTC cannot be this relative unit.

You are in the US, so nothing unusual in that. In Ukraine, however, even people from the western part have contacts with Russian speaking citizens. Sure, you can find small town where nobody speaks Russian* (but in such places often you find Ukrainian dialects much different form mainline version), but in larger cities everybody knows enough of both languages to communicate.
** on other hand you can hardly find place where nobody understands Ukrainian. But if you try, you can even find place where Hungarian is in majority. Or Bulganin and even Romanian.

Crimea had special autonomous status in Ukraine, so yes, it was never truly a part of Ukraine. However, it's common misconception that Soviet Union gave anything anybody. It was one country without state borders. Only administrative division. From that point of view it was logical to move Crimea under Ukrainian responsibility, because it's depended from water and energy from the mainland. But, part of Slobozhanschyna (north east of Ukraine) was transferred to Russia at the same time. I don't see Ukraine trying to get it back (I don't think we should, but still). When Soviet Union fell, Ukraine welcomed Crimean Tatars back to Crimea. But now, under Russian control once again there are repressions against non-Russian and non-Christian population. Many Crimean Tatars now live on the continent. But many more are still there (they love their land and are very attached to it) while Russia is deporting their cultural leaders. I don't think Russia have guts to repeat Stalin's relocation, but overall climate is not very friendly.
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:55:21
Slobozhanschyna is an Ukrainian core of the east. If you look at the map, north of Lugansk oblast isn't a war area, because it is a part of historical Slobozhanschyna and it is more Ukrainian and agricultural, than industrial Donbass. Donbass, as Kuban, was settled by Russians after Holodomor. Slobozhanshcyna suffered Holodomor as well (like all of Ukraine, except western part, because it was under Poland rule). I think Ukrainian population there declined as well, and that made transfer easier.

I cannot use anything than UAH for legal debts inside the country. It doesn't mean USD (for example) is banned. I can buy USD, I can own USD, I can sell USD.

you can't withdraw cash with them. Only buy BTC for cash. And the rate is not very good. As for today 1 BTC cost 5466.57 UAH. But you'll need to feed 6298.44 UAH in this ATM to get 1 BTC.

Ok. I'm Ukrainian so I can read Ukrainian language and NBU regulation information. Some things to clarify:
1. It is called National Bank (NBU), not Central Bank
2. They did not *BAN* Bitcoin.
3. They stated that Bitcoin is not regulated by them, so they cannot guaranty safety of your funds.
4. They stated that Bitcoins are often used in illegal activites. And they kinda are.
5. They pointed out that persons and legal entities can only use national currency - Ukrainian Hryvnia - for all official payments. It's nothing new, you cannot use anything but UAH for selling goods or providing services inside Ukraine.
6. They asked citizens to be vigilante when using Bitcoins.
