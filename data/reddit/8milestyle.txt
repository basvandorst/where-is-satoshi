I turned 300$ to like 2750is in about 5 years. If it hits 8k then I'll have a 10x return in about 5 years. I would hold what you got for at least 5 years. I'll spend some on digital stuff from the Microsoft store when the price is all time high

Rising Stock prices are inflation

Watch the money velocity chart. Velocity has been slow but I would guess when it pics up inflation will appear in the things money  moves into.
