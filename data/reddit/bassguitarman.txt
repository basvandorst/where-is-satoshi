Did I mention it's open source?  
It uses the twilio api, so just set it up as a callback url if you decide to set up your own

i'm paying for the api out of my pocket, because the fees are minimal.  I won't ask for donations because i don't need them. It will always be free for users

False, I am not a "shill" and I do believe they have some problems, but they are a legitimate company.  It really hurts posts like these when they are associated with people like you who chose passion over facts
@_date: 2014-05-01 05:39:10
True, but considering the blockchain isn't exclusive to bitcoin, we just need some cryptocurrency that is valuable
@_date: 2014-09-17 01:51:14
I have a cryptocurrency multireddit with a bunch of subs.  I'm sure a few of those are open
@_date: 2014-06-03 19:27:20
You have to look at the context.  1,900,000,000 from one of the largest banks in the world is a slap on the wrist

P2pool is an open source, multi currency software.  There is no one p2pool, anyone can make their own pool if they wish, and charge whatever they like

Considering hes probably saving a shit-ton of money by not paying you minimum wage , and having you rely on tips for a salary, I don't care if it's legal or not, thats a shitty thing to do

I didn't even see Dorian, nice touch
@_date: 2014-05-01 05:26:15
I think the Blockchain can be valuable and Bitcoin not valuable, or the other way around, and both can be together
@_date: 2014-06-13 07:49:57
Both of you are right.
There is no one p2pool.  P2pool is decentralized and anyone can make their own node
@_date: 2014-06-08 06:47:23
You can merge mine with p2pools.  I would suggest finding one that supports it.
In fact p2pool is the only major pool software of the 3 major ones that supports mergedmining
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:20:04
@_date: 2014-06-08 07:59:21
False.  There are many no fee p2pools
@_date: 2014-09-17 01:59:54
Awesome!  I'll compile some more if you're interested
@_date: 2014-12-16 21:38:58
Great job.  I bought an end the fed round from them, first silver purchase ever

@_date: 2014-06-08 06:53:22
Why do we even need a foundation
@_date: 2014-06-02 20:10:11
Not true.  It's possible, but you need to be lucky (or unlucky) enough that they do solve the next block.  It is not very likely that they will, but if they do, you get your btc back.
@_date: 2014-05-29 23:21:46
Ya :(
@_date: 2015-05-04 01:55:36
The network wouldn't be held up.  The basement node would be stuck on the wrong fork, but it wouldn't affect the network

@_date: 2015-01-19 03:45:47
I may do that, but I do respect the exchange, and this would easily be exploited by even a child, so I don't want them to lose money. 
Do you have any advice, as I feel releasing it would be unethical
@_date: 2015-01-13 05:56:47

@_date: 2015-08-15 20:29:25
Should we censor tonal bitcoins?  Which you call an alt coin? 
@_date: 2015-08-14 07:38:21
Oh god.
This will not be pretty when everyone and their dog is making an exchange 
@_date: 2015-08-12 04:32:27
Or maybe an actual fungible currency

@_date: 2015-08-15 20:40:02
Oh, just like BitcoinXT?  What you are saying is that it is an alt coin, but you can't forget, it's partially bitcoin (shared blockchain up to fork). so under your logic we shouldn't censor it.
Thanks for making your hypocrisy clear :)
@_date: 2015-07-27 09:33:39
None of that makes what you're doing ok
@_date: 2015-07-27 06:14:30
Getgems is a fork of telegram, which is open source
Telegram is open sourced under gpl license (see 
This means the MUST make their source code available, or else they are creating some ethical violations/breaking the law (
Getgems is closed source which means 1) I wouldn't trust them with my BTC (even if they are trustworthy, they might have code flaws which peer review could find) 2) They're kind of pissing on open source developers
