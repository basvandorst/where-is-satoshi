@_date: 2018-09-28 10:50:05
Yeah but which year?

Is he related to Andrew Ng?
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:01:08
People dont think that far in the crisis, besides, they need cash to feed their family?
@_date: 2018-10-15 12:05:57
Why is it not though?
@_date: 2018-10-12 01:50:25


Then why the sudden extreme buys/sells?
@_date: 2018-10-13 01:08:42
TL;DR: some dude did some study and he said that:.., very convincing!
@_date: 2018-10-05 04:18:46


I want to believe you
@_date: 2018-10-15 06:18:56
Thank you btc, guess btc got my voice msg
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:37:23
You optimistic, me like
@_date: 2018-10-11 11:12:13
So, is the panic over? Are we cool yet guys? 
@_date: 2018-10-05 03:55:43
Can the bull just run already please?!
@_date: 2018-10-20 14:56:13
Only time can tell

Why is hopium flying around today? Did I miss something?
@_date: 2018-10-16 14:58:30
Does anyone have insight to what is going on? The price these days are in staircase shape (what is the correct term? Is there anything shady here?
@_date: 2018-10-15 11:15:57
Thats why I dont understand why btc holders are scared of usdt collapsing
@_date: 2018-10-28 00:05:57
It was also stable in 2014 no?
@_date: 2018-10-08 07:06:15


that's mean
@_date: 2018-10-05 16:47:25
The flattening (2018)
@_date: 2018-10-08 13:05:37
Dont be so mean man, give people a little hope could you please?
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:49:32
Noobs question: everybody talk about bull run when stock market crashes, but isn’t that the time people sell everything, including coins, for cash? Wouldn’t people need cash to cover their loss from stocks/lay-off, and also cash is the safest commodity in most people’s mind?
@_date: 2018-10-27 23:35:25
Yes but we can do the same with USD. So these stable coins are for coin exchange only? Like binance?
@_date: 2018-10-24 15:39:44
I know you are joking but the chart looks rather positive to me, I expected a dip today but no, btc resisted :)
Hope I don't talk too soon.
@_date: 2018-10-15 11:08:26
I have a question: if people run away from usdt, will btc and other alts see a rise in price? Is it a good thing for btc holders? Since $ is pouring into btc and alts, not stable coins?
Why are people so scared of usdt collapsing?
@_date: 2018-10-22 14:22:32


November 2018?
@_date: 2018-10-24 09:17:59
I bet you will never get that $1000
@_date: 2018-10-11 06:18:22


The "market" realized that and decided to take action in a few seconds? Sounds legit.
@_date: 2018-10-24 10:42:46
1000 btc
@_date: 2018-10-22 09:50:32
What do you think why the low volatility? Whales slowly dumping all of their coins? Institution quietly buying in? People just don't care (then why no crash to 0?)? 6450 is the real value?
@_date: 2018-10-21 14:53:17


Count me in. 100% saving in btc, I'm 30+, 90% mortgage unpaid.
@_date: 2018-10-13 05:07:13
What common sense?

( ( ( ( ( HODL ) ) ) ) )
@_date: 2018-10-15 00:49:13
I need cash to fund my clan, have to give out XMas bonus, btc please do something!
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:01:39
When selling my behind?
@_date: 2018-10-24 04:37:14
I bet it will hit $1k, but I also am not certain about the date
@_date: 2018-10-22 09:47:37
Thanks man, almost replied him.
@_date: 2018-10-24 08:44:55
crossing the desert, to that ATH :)
@_date: 2018-10-27 23:36:58
Thats how the rest makes money, from others’ impatience.
@_date: 2018-10-24 15:36:36
I bet he would never get that 1000 btc from me, for this new bet, I place 2000 btc.
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:02:09

It's chicken and egg guys, first, need to create a fake interest aka hype --&gt; real interest --&gt; price increases --&gt; interest increases --&gt; price increases--&gt; .. --&gt; moon
@_date: 2018-10-09 09:25:19
1 BTC = 1 BTC, forever, how is it not stable?
@_date: 2018-10-20 11:16:07
Me, unless I go broke, I would never sell under $25k
@_date: 2018-10-15 04:16:44
Why doesnt the media do that again though?
@_date: 2018-10-15 08:58:36
chicken and egg question I think
@_date: 2018-10-08 09:18:39
I think November, since most people get their bonus at the end of October. Also November = holidays mood.
@_date: 2018-10-28 01:02:18
Oh I see. Didn’t know some countries tax for trading, Im from a tax heaven.
@_date: 2019-02-11 08:43:16
But high, sell NEVER
@_date: 2019-02-09 05:15:20
Me right now reading your post after last night :)
@_date: 2019-02-10 13:55:05
This little pump is only to serve a later massive dump, which will happen very soon.
Mark my words.
@_date: 2019-02-04 12:42:59
Moon, Lambo, pretty dark and deep \s
@_date: 2019-02-21 04:25:54


$0 here we go?
@_date: 2019-02-17 11:44:20
But fuck it I hate that sub 
@_date: 2019-02-01 05:39:48
How about rinsing between btc and alts? 10% at a time, pretty sweet.
@_date: 2019-02-13 10:59:13
Crash incoming
@_date: 2019-04-13 15:04:02
He started with good, somewhat heroic jntention but now he wants glory. I dont see its too hard to understand, human nature.
@_date: 2019-04-20 14:18:56
How much btc did you pay? How do they price in btc? Btc price tag changes every hour?
@_date: 2019-04-10 08:24:02
@_date: 2019-04-10 08:23:38
Lol trade btc for jewelry? Good choice /s
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:46:17
Wow, price fell and people here are eating each other!
@_date: 2018-11-26 03:19:49
50k by the end if 2018
@_date: 2018-11-13 21:51:47
Less supply for no demand doesn’t cause price surge
@_date: 2018-11-28 07:52:53
Is the lambo question valid again?
@_date: 2018-11-07 12:13:03
FUDGenerator generating FUD, move along, nothing to see here.
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:07:43
Price plummeted and people became so rude here.
@_date: 2018-11-21 07:44:06
Buy high, sell never!
But seriously no sell no lose guys, just quietly hodl and wait for the moooooon
@_date: 2018-11-30 10:08:41
inb4 the next bloodbath!
@_date: 2018-11-13 21:54:05
Well, at least thats what the average people think, you have to convince them otherwise
@_date: 2018-11-30 08:16:45
They were high on hopium!
@_date: 2018-11-02 00:18:44
I hope you are right but how can you be so sure?
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:47:38
Is this real?
@_date: 2019-01-16 07:10:58
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:31:47
Including mine T_T
@_date: 2018-11-26 08:56:08
People are angry at themselves, I put in $200k, lost half but I don’t give a damn. This too shall pass.
@_date: 2019-01-02 06:08:07
@_date: 2019-01-14 08:52:34
Tax evasion purpose?
@_date: 2018-11-30 02:28:11


True that but man this guy gives us hopium to go through this long winter.
@_date: 2019-01-02 06:09:34
Still above $1? You give me hope.
@_date: 2018-11-02 06:16:49
You will become a 10-year HODLER, billionaire confirmed.
@_date: 2018-11-13 23:16:09
I have no doubt in the technology, but not sure if people will trust crypto/btc.
And also, not less supply, it’s less additional supply.
@_date: 2018-11-07 00:28:54
I feel it too, so fact confirmed!
@_date: 2018-11-12 11:34:13
I can feel the bull jogging coming this XMas
@_date: 2018-12-24 10:56:53
There was a drop one hour ago
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:07:39
You need to speed up this gif 10 times.
@_date: 2018-12-03 07:43:43
Someone put up some btc sign, bull run tomorrow confirmed.
@_date: 2018-12-24 10:47:17
The train is losing steam :(
@_date: 2018-12-22 07:15:10
