Good idea, done! 500 bits @_date: 2017-08-27 22:30:40


As a user, I am authorized to get my product within 5 seconds after submitting my payment. That is what is meant by "transaction completion".
Further, things getting fixed (in the case of fraud, for example), is a good thing that Visa provides me at no cost (I pay my credit card on time).
On top of that, Visa also gives me cash back or reward points.
All around a better user experience.


Why would you want this when paying for goods and services? What if things go wrong? Bad shipment, damaged item, wrong price, etc. Reversibility of merchant transactions *is a feature*.

It doesn't, but they won't realize that until later when they remove CR and it becomes useless. Read the rest of the paragraph.
edit: I reread that paragraph and my explanation is unclear: when I say they switch off of blockchains, I mean both users and miners. Because the CR-fork will have changed PoW, I'm not sure what would happen to the miners of the centralized chain. Perhaps tweaks can be brought to their systems and to the CR-fork PoW so that the hardware does not go to waste, but it would have to be done in such a way that we know we're not headed back for the same centralization tendencies.
