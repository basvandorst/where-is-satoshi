Not necessarily. They do have high exchange rates and some require ID for larger transactions, but they are instant USD cash to BTC (or vice versa). The higher exchange rates or fees are due to the ultra-high convenience. Exchanges can take weeks or months for verification or to accept a USD deposit. Also, no bank info goes into atm's whereas online exchanges are at risk of hacks with your info.

When a person keeps their crypto on an exchange, the exchange is the owner of the private key. Since some exchanges use data storage *connected to the internet*, the private keys may be vulnerable to attack/hacks. 
However, if the private keys are stored *offline* (aka cold storage), they are essentially protected from hack.
@_date: 2018-09-28 08:32:42
Feed the trolls much?
@_date: 2018-09-28 07:03:34

A private key is the "key" to a bitcoin wallet address. It is used to uniquely "sign" transactions (if you were to send bitcoin). It is encrypted by an elliptical curve algorithm.
Long story short, if you own your own private key (and do not share it, hence *private*) your bitcoin is safe. If you had someone else's private key, you could take their bitcoin. If someone had your private key, they could swipe your bitcoin.
There is a theory that a quantum computer may be able to break the encryption of private keys, but we're nowhere near that right now. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 06:01:20
Exchanges get hacked, not bitcoin. Hold your own private keys. 
Not your private keys, not your bitcoin.

I'm not planning on going through electrum. All that seems overcomplicated. The plan is to import BTC directly into my blockchaininfo wallet first. Since there are now 2 chains, I think the BCH should stay on paper. I will then import the BCH into electron cash.
However,  the replay protection on BCH may be one-sided. I may have to do the electrum method after all. I'm just going to wait for a while to see what's up.

Many people on this sub were expecting too much of a quick return from venture capital funds / institutional money. 
Hear me out. If you were the manager of a large sum of capital (owned by many other people), would you drop a high portion of that value on a brand new offering in bitcoin futures? Even if it put multiple millions of your clients'  at risk?
Institutional investors want to see at least a glimpse of what happens with the (relatively) smaller initial performance. I'm not just implying price when I say performance, but also the ongoing security of Bakkt and its other features. They want to see firm proof that Bakkt doesn't end up "Hakkt". 
I firmly do not believe that Bakkt has been a failure, thus far at least. The water is chummed, wait for the sharks. I think they will come with a little time, but we must be patient.

Ok for a low amount, your easiest option would be to use a bitcoin atm (assuming there is one around your location). Check out coinatmradar.com to see if there are any near you. The only downside of BTC ATMs is that they have a high exchange rate in comparison to other options.
Your next best option would be to go through an exchange. Signing up and initial verification are simple. Personally I've never bought BTC with USD on an exchange, only traded altcoins for BTC. 
The third option is localbitcoins.com , but I've never used it myself.
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:58:33

If you live in the US, there are Know Your Customer and Anti Money Laundering laws. You could try coinatmradar.com and buy small amounts without ID, but BTC ATMs have really high exchange rates. You usually need to scan your ID to buy more than $1k at a time with an ATM.

A paper wallet can be made from a computer connected to the internet, however that brings risk of compromising the private keys if the computer is infected with spyware. Therefore, the most secure way to create one is by using an offline operating system, namely Ubuntu, running from a flashdrive. 
Another concern is that printers with wifi ability save the paper wallet in their cache, and the cache may be vulnerable if the printer is connected to internet.
Here's a guide to make a secure paper wallet. The only difference I would recommend would be to use segwitaddress.org instead of the legacy addresses from bitaddress.org.

If you're looking for the easy route, first search your area on coin atm radar. This will search your area for Bitcoin ATM's. The downside is large fees. If you want lower fees, bitcoin exchanges are your path. But it usually takes several days extra to get verified by said exchange. Higher levels of verification can be a nightmare if you want speed.

Computer hardware changes very quickly. How do we even know if the hardware wallets of today will be compatible with computers of that time? How do we know if the hardware wallets will even function properly after that many years?
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:45:27
Then they fight you.
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:24:13
Why does it have to happen right now of all times? More US gov't foul play?
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:15:07
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:45:17
Natural fluctuation
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:55:46
I feel your pain, I did the same at an atm with a super high exchange rate earlier. Fortunately when i panicked and went back, i had already maxed out the daily transaction limit. Phew.
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:43:24
Let's do it!!!
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:54:45
If you're in it for long term, a paper wallet is much easier to stash somewhere *secure* and forget about than using a hardware wallet imo.
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:52:55
Ah shit sorry. There used to be a site with a very similar name that was ran by the "anonymous" group which claimed to multiply however much btc you put in by 10 in a month.
@_date: 2017-05-18 00:20:31
Sounds a little "no bueno" to me.
@_date: 2017-07-04 05:18:40
Damn this is too good. Thanks a million.
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:58:10
We are guaranteed Segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:39:31
Anything that claims to multiply your bitcoin is a straight up scam. Don't fall for it.
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:34:48
Sell. Kill it and let Jihan shit the bed.
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:06:28
Made me lol.
@_date: 2017-07-23 05:04:22
HODL strong!
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:56:43
Oh yeah, and the mad gains.
@_date: 2017-07-23 06:00:12
Seriously what a letdown
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:44:54
We need to purge the poison first: Jihad, CW, Vermin...etc.
@_date: 2017-07-04 04:02:41
Finally, a decently made BTC song. Cheers.
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:51:33
Bitcoin: great. Litecoin: sure ok. Dogecoin: Really? What is this 2013?
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:51:47
Wow really man? The zuck is an addict of whoring for people's data and microtransactions. Do you really think he would create something financially liberating without taking credit or a cut for himself? Absolutely not.
@_date: 2019-05-09 01:02:42
What does this have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-27 05:21:41
That's what they said last time, then they banned it and everyone freaked out.
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:57:34
Bitpremier used to be a site for luxury homes, cars, and yachts, but they closed their website. ��
@_date: 2017-07-03 18:43:43
Time to figure out some kind of pest control. 
@_date: 2019-05-27 23:25:50
Ah gotcha, I can't really tell on this phone. Cheers.
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:56:10
Fackin Peter Schiff.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:20:54
Wow. I'm a dumbass. Thanks for helping me see the light through the huge brain fart.
@_date: 2018-12-25 00:29:15
Samourai is the best wallet for Android, bar none. Coinomi works alright, but they have relatively high fees and they took *forever* to implement segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-20 04:45:52
Why lose all your btc in poker when you can just get gains from holding? 
@_date: 2017-06-19 02:19:39
Student loans. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:55:57
My bad you're right.
@_date: 2017-06-21 03:30:26
Thanks for the bump bro.
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:44:56
Landing on moon in 5, 4, 3... Oh shit Coinbase just went down.
@_date: 2017-06-29 22:22:11
I don't care how much flak i catch for this. Let's be honest: you should have a gun to protect your assets to begin with. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 03:59:26
What does this have to do with bitcoin? Fuck right off with your off-topic propaganda.
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:02:34
I feel ya, I'm in BME. There's no way in hell I would understand bitcoin trends if I hadn't gone into engineering. Humanities/arts is a laugh to me. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:45:31
Thanks for the well wishes.
@_date: 2017-06-09 05:49:58
Does it really make a difference? See the trends, learn the trends, play off the trends. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:22:44
Totally not what I wanted...
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:22:45
I lost it.
@_date: 2017-06-24 21:53:45
It's terrible.
@_date: 2017-06-01 03:22:52
Why is u/sunnystartups in the tops twice? Both times for weak, unconvincing material/data?
@_date: 2018-12-29 23:11:02
What a great q4...
@_date: 2018-12-30 01:21:02
Good. Serves him right.
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:09:03
Why not just post the normal speech? The effects are unnecessary and rather annoying.
@_date: 2018-12-30 02:00:10
Good move.
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:02:50
I'm all in. Let's destroy 3k!
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:22:07
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:48:06
Oh nice I wasn't aware of this. Even better
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:53:31
Maybe it represents a hard-on for BTC? Close enough placement.
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:46:14
Can anyone explain the reason for the banana? It kinda ruins the entire image imo.
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:50:41
Backwards much?
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:40:58
I mean fuck it, we have segwit with some kind of consensus. Does it really matter how bitcoin runs? Gains incoming. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:26:36
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-06-21 05:20:56
Uh, no.
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:54:08
Bruh manual is where it's at.
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:28:09
I just wish he could've waited for about a week so we could totally recover from the drop a couple days ago...
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:37:52
Basically this just means while everyone else is signalling segwit/uasf, jihan alone will be mining his uahf? 
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:51:32
Considering he was an activist for BU, it's less hard to believe for me. He kinda reminds me of the "lowered expectations" skits from mad tv.
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:45:35
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:50:18
I don't get it
