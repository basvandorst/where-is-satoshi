Congrats! I'm working to get there - is my dream to own a whole BTC in the future. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 07:27:59
Can you help me with how to do this?

Do you know what it would be in the case of storing them with electrum? Will that support BCC? 
@_date: 2017-07-06 12:15:45
Obviously no one knows for certain and people are assuming things keeping in mind the advantages the technology brings and how it will be more widely used in the future. There's definitely a chance that it goes south and people don't see the value in blockchain, but as things stand, it is highly probably that the technology will only develop more and cryptos would be more widely used

It's not spam, just want to know what to do when it invariably splits on Aug 1. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:27:09
Did you buy some yesterday? 
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:48:54
Yeah I was planning on selling it to get some GNT and then buy back when it crashes 
@_date: 2017-06-09 03:51:49
Just read up on bitcoin and one of the advantages listed was the lack of a transaction fee that would make it more attractive in international payments. Thoughts on that?

10 years is a long time. If cryptos have anywhere near as much adoption as we are hoping, I'd say 50k is towards the lower side of the price range in 10 years. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 08:48:46
Really? 
Edit: just saw the PS 
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:37:46
How do I access my private key via electrum and bread wallet? 
@_date: 2017-06-29 04:12:55
Hahaha there is an obvious untruth in that bitcoin won't get far! But it lists decentralization as one of the disadvantages and have quoted the price to be $1000, so... 
@_date: 2017-06-10 16:35:57
I plan to buy a certain amount every month for the next 15 months irrespective of how much it crashes/goes up. Think long term ~7-8 years it's going to be a spectacular investment 
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:31:23
In terms of long term value? 
@_date: 2017-06-08 05:49:42
Could you tell me how the ledger Nano S works? 
@_date: 2017-06-08 05:19:00
Is Xapo a good place to store them long term? 
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:27:45
I use cex as an exchange. Didn't plan on day trading and am holding long term and planning to buy a certain amount of coin each month for the next year at least. With the BTC at a discount though thought of trading some ETH for BTC and then get some ETH back once BTC recovers. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:54:48
I use Exodus for storing GNT and leave a small amount of BTC there to exchange for other cryptos. Long term electrum is much safer. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 04:15:36
Don't buy on an Indian exchange. They sell at a high premium. I use cex even though it sells at a little premium but significantly less than Indian exchanges like Zebpay. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:00:07
Hahaha it is! As long as bitcoin does half as well as Chelsea have done post 2004 I'll be a very happy man 
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:41:41
Cex.io is pretty decent 
@_date: 2017-06-08 05:46:07
How is Xapo to store long term? 
@_date: 2017-06-29 08:48:23
It's a very popular newspaper in the northern states. This one is the Chandigarh edition. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:47:13
Currently have 50/30/20 in BTC, ETH and GNT respectively. Thoughts? 
@_date: 2017-06-08 05:15:50
Could anyone walk me through the steps needed to do that? I hear of these exchanges running into trouble all the time and thus was apprehensive about holding it long term on it 
@_date: 2017-06-13 05:12:00
It works well for the short term and I'm using exodus myself, but if and when u have large amounts consider buying a hard wallet like trezor, ledger nano s etc 
@_date: 2017-06-17 05:17:17
What do you guys think about cex.io? 
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:14:48
What altcoins are u looking at? 
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:48:19
Have you looked into GNT? 
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:46:06
Have you used Exodus? Seems to be an alternative to Jaxx 
@_date: 2017-06-29 04:11:53
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:55:42
Sarcasm? ��
@_date: 2017-06-29 04:21:53
You can do both. I use the credit card since I do it for not so large amounts which pretty much ensures the fee they take is less than or equal to an international wire transfer fee 
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:09:01
Haha you think ETH and other ctyptos are a better bet than BTC? 
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:25:48
What wallet do you use for ethereum? 
@_date: 2017-06-22 04:10:38
It depends on which country you're trying to buy from. I live in India and the exchanges here sell bitcoin at a 20-30% premium so I buy on cex.io 
@_date: 2017-06-20 11:49:07
Why does he not want to signal segwit? Because that would make fees lower?
