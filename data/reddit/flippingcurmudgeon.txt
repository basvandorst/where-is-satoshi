They don't answer texts and make decisions after hours? ;-)

There's a tipping point my mind arrives at where it turns from possibility of miscommunication/people being dramatic to actual evidence of complete incompetence.

Obviously there were no leaders left.

I guess you could make excuses.

Zero sympathy for them now if they get hacked from this point on.

Is more than 5% of the population capable of "waking up" to anything?

Growing pains indeed, but there seems to be few people involved committed to actually gaining freedom from the system that feeds on those weaknesses. Childish behavior like this shit instead of having some nuts and calling out Coinbase for what they are in place that's highly visible.

A wonderfully timeless invention systematically torn apart by humanity's weaknesses. Nothing new...

The real purpose for the invention of blockchain technology is to stop the past from being manipulated by something in the future (quantum retrocausality) by permanently recording computationally indestructible records.
It sounds crazy, doesn't it?

Then maybe? They'll be wolfing down Soylent Green after the TV says that eating people is perfectly safe.

Those kind of people will always go with the flow with the prevailing paradigm in place, there is no point in arguing with them. 
If you want change, you're going to have to get them "dumb" folk convinced in a way besides logic.

Never. They want to be led. Do you become what you hate to corral the sheep in a different direction? 
@_date: 2016-05-07 20:03:04
Your argument is logical, but we know the State makes and enforces its own rules and doesn't treat everyone equally.

Still can't connect to anything with this version either on Windows 7, even with firewall disabled. I have tried all the recommended troubleshooting steps. No, I don't want any assistance, this shit is too much of a pain in the ass.
