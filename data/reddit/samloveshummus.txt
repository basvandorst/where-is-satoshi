Yeah and allocating 0.003% of my salary to lottery ticket number 3 10 12 20 29 46 would have increased my returns by 3000%.
My point is that hindsight is 20/20, past performance is no guarantee of future returns, and that an investor who buys a highly volatile instrument is much more likely to lose than win big.

Enjoy waking up to find out millions have cashed out, your sole 'asset' is plummeting, and no fool wanting to take it off your hands.

That's exactly right. There's no way that any but a tiny fraction of the "hodlers" will ever be able to materialize their paper gains. Once the price starts falling no-one will want to buy a rapidly depreciating asset.

I lived next door to a grow house in 2009 and we didn't have to turn on our own central heating in the winter because there was so much heat coming through the wall, until the cops busted it.

Not until he cashes out and manages to do so before the bubble bursts. There are far more hypothetical millionaires than there are people who would pay them the market price for their assets.

But Apple/Google/Microsoft share prices go up because they make stuff so people give them money. Bitcoin goes up mainly because of the money being injected into the system by new people buying in. Everyone who bought in can't be better off at the same time. Where did that money come from?

Why would buying crypto with a credit card *not* be considered a cash advance? It's clearly not goods or services such as would earn the credit card company a fee.

It's really just a side bet on the value of bitcoin, which is economically equivalent to holding the bitcoin though the counterparty risk is different.

Assuming the brokerage isn't run by morons they will invest most of the deposits in such a way as to minimize their exposure to the actual price fluctuations. But they don't need to trade every time a client buys or sells; a lot of the time they'll be able to transfer a balance from one client's account directly to another one's.

That's true in general, but there are *some* laws which restrain the rich and powerful for the benefit of the regular person, and financial regulations are some of those laws. Sophisticated traders would make a killing if every chump and their dog were allowed to trade risky high-return derivatives and get massacred.
