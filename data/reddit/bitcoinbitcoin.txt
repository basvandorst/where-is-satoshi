Circle has yet to launch, yet it seems like every week ( or day ) they get publicity about their views on Bitcoin.   How about just launching.  
Not trying to be a dick, but focus all your effort on launching a successful project first, before stating your opinions IMHO.

Your chart is a guess; nothing more and nothing less.

You have no idea what your talking about dick.

It wasn't initially.

It's a joke that they post updates like this, or any other serious news on their Facebook wall.

"Little reason to believe lag times caused the drop".  Really?  The lag did indeed cause the drop.  Also to say a correction was inevitable is pure speculation anyways.

Mtgox: Get some f'ng Erlang and Redis guys in there.  Rewrite your shitty code on dev.  Push the dev version to prod asap
Who the hell cares if you have to spend a couple of million to do that.

Yeah MtGox was an integral part to Bitcoin taking off.  That doesn't mean things like, getting hacked, extraordinary lag times, and not registering with FinCEN is excusable.

Lag times brought the price down from around $250 to below $100 in less than a day.  I could go on with various other examples, but it seems like you're in serious denial.  
The point is, bad press from lag time, hacks, and not registering with FinCen hurts bitcoin overall.  Not the actual protocol of bitcoin, but the perception of what it is.  And that's all that matters when it comes to global adoption.
You can't tell me with a straight face that MtGox couldn't have done a better job on all 3 points in my original comment, then I don't know what to tell ya.  It's like you're saying it's ok to be a subpar company and not take responsibility for pertinent problems.
