Haters are hating on mainstream adoption. Crypto badly needs it and this will create new fiat demand for it.
At this point in time fiat demand for bitcoin and crypto is the best thing for it.
Also did anyone think that current  financial giants would actually be beaten by crypto? They don't lose they join knew paradigms so this is a good sign.
Bitcoin will eventually be Tier 1 capital for banks. And be held by central banks. That is the best we can realistically hope for.

I wouldn't try to avoid taxes. Big exchanges can take $1 million+ orders or you can have a third party trading company sell it OTC/ spread out between exchanges to avoid major price changes.
Americans have to live in Puerto Rico for 183 days and gain residence to avoid taxes legally. Renounci g citizenship wont work well because of exit taxes. Changing residency doesnt help USA citizens. 
All others can change residency to a low capital gains country.

There is plenty of evidence. "No idea" is not accurate either. And bitcoin t's are easily tracked so not anonymous.
Just b/c retail doesnt know exactly who this is does not mean chainalysis and a bunch of other parties are in the dark.

My first response was to someone who wrote "No idea" who owns theses addresses. That's why I wrote we do have good ideas of who it is.  
If it is tagged mt gox it is far more likely that. Then also far more likely we will see another idiotic dump from them.

Insider trading, yes. But I guess it isn't illegal in an unregulated matket

The OP origins link  points to silk road. Bitcoin is not anonymous, read the OP and see how s/he tracked all the tx's... and no exchange would take 10k of bitcoin without kyc.

Retail made it a bubble in December. 
An ETF locks up a ton of supply that will also put massive positive pressure on the price.
It also allows people/institutions to gain exposure without worrying about the tech/wallets and other complicated actions/risks of holding your own.

Dude cant make a profit on any of his cars yet. Tesla loses money every year and BMW, Mercedes, Porsche, and Audi are all entering the luxury e-market soon.
Just saying he may not be the best businessman to back Bitcoin. I'd much rather have Bezos.

Amazon stock is over-priced for sure. But It makes small profits each year.  Since 2006 only 6 negative quarters.
The difference is AMZN uses revenues as R&amp;D and start new businesses like AWS.
TSLA needs bonds and share offerings (new, financed cash injections) to keep the business running.

This feels like a mt. Gox dump coming up.
I see lots of posts trying to spin this as potentially positive. There is little doubt in my mind this is to liquidate the position

My post was 100% accurate. If you don't like facts keep downvoting.

This is telling. The 1st ranked advisor company in the US says they love the crypto asset class but cannot tell any customers to buy because of lack of SEC regulations.
SEC regs will bring 1-5% allocation recommendations for this asset class. Just have to buy and be patient.

I am looking forward to those L2's as well. Tumblers shapeshift and separate addresses are fine to stay anonymous from nosey people. However it wont keep any sophisticated entities or governments from eventually finding out who you are if they want to.  Good point on cash and cocaine. Most of us are not doing anything wrong and would probably not be identified for analysis.

Dont nations already outsource their monetary policy to (privately owned) central banks?

Holding USD used to net real interest of 5%+.  Now we pay much more In fees than interest for the honour of keeping our bank accounts.
Let's not pretend that the main reason we are better off is mainly because of debt-based fractional reserve banking.
It simply allows exorbitant profits for banking institutions because they are loaning out 10x OUR deposits....so banks become insanely affluent loaniNg out OUR deposits and using the FED's emergency liquidity when they get in trouble.

I think these features are cool. Looking forward to LN. But I am also looking forward to all of the other crypto scaling solutions for payments. If another solution (for instance paypal's) receives more adoption I am still bullish on bitcoin. 
My point was to say that it isnt simple for bitcoin or any crypto  to adopt xmr's privacy features. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 04:15:07
Which larger (or smaller) cryptocurrency is even trying to do what Monero does? XMR uses mandatory Ring ct, ring sigs, and stealth addresses. The september fork adds bullet proofs and soon kovri (built in tor).  What cryptocurrencies will implement mimblewimbe first? I highly doubt btc and would bet xmr will be at the top of the list.
When has BTC forked new features ever beyond segwit? Blocksize debates ripped the community into factions.
If you think that btc will be a leader in privacy features the core developers better get their asses in gear. And they need to poach some monero developers for help.
I am long btc but not in hopes that it becomes private.

Yes. 15k to 12k...20k to 15k...40k to 25k...80k to  55k...etc etc etc. Most likely not time this correctly. Now you have a cheat-sheet. GOOD LUCK

  You are talking about two different things. Monero is a deflationary currency. "Dividends" come in the form of price appreciation due to demand increasing vs supply. So the answer is no. 
Marketplace plus currency would be something like what Particl and others are trying to do. Having a single market place is a limiting factor in many ways. DNMs for instance can accept any currency they want to. A single entity like Particl may only have one market "Paricl's" that could pass profits to token holders.
If Monero remains the most private and fungible cryptocurrency on earth, then its acceptance will grow in many markets including DNMs, offshore funds, and mainstream markets. So Monero focusing on its core competency and staying the best at it is a much better path for its future than creating and operating a competing marketplace to other already operating monero-using markets

Ok. What specific L2 solutions are in the pipeline for btc or in general?  I would like to research them so any input is appreciated. What key management strategies keep btc used on the darknet from being flagged by chainalysis etc? 
@_date: 2018-03-11 04:24:32
XMR developers  implemented bullet-proofs  and it is being audited now. This will decrease transaction size by 80%. Mimble-wimble alone wont create privacy to the effect of ring sigs ct and stealth addresses.  Plus xmr will likely imlement MW before btc and most others.

The govt going into debt allows gdp to grow at a greater rate than debt? Not really since around 1980. And the debt isnt rising fast right now vs gdp growth because interest rates are artificially held low with central banks buying their own debt with printed money.
Companies are good at leveraging debt. Countries are historically terrible at this.

Debt to social security and medicare/Medicaid. All th fica taxes you pay support the treasury ponzi scheme that keeps retirement entitlements afloat.
Defaulting on the debt will hit these retirees before it hits foreign debt holders.
That's why inflation is the key. The payments keep comi g from devalued dollars.

Many comodities ETFs may only own derivatives, futures contracts. 
But with bitcoin it is very easy to store so having a "physical" ETF would be pretty easy for cryptocurrencies
