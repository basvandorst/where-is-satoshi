You just prompted me to get on my soap box ;)
Ghana is a great example but it's just the tip of the iceberg. A lot of Americans (including myself until recently) are totally ignorant to the monetary shenanigans that have been pulled by governments and central banks all over the world. 
Obviously there are the episodes of [hyperinflation]( which are worth reading up on. For every example of hyperinflation on that wikipedia page, there's at least five more that weren't included and their causes can be anything.. war, incompetence, corruption, general oppression. 
In addition to hyperinflation you have the demonetization events like Ghana and the [USSR]( Then you have crazy shit like the [Khmer Rouge]( trying to abolish money altogether. 
Those of us living in the U.S. or Europe have been relatively insulated from hyperinflation for the last ~60 years but it really gets to the core of why Bitcoin is worth what it is.

Yea. I'm guessing you sent some BTC to your Bitcoin address before August 1st. 
On August 1st, the Bitcoin network had something called a 'soft fork' to add Segwit. Segwit is necessary for Lightning Network and helps scale the Bitcoin network. 
Some users didn't like Segwit for a variety of reasons. So rather than adopting Segwit, they 'hard forked' Bitcoin and started their own network called Bitcoin Cash (aka BCash/BCH) which scaled the network by increasing block sizes instead of using Segwit. 
The BTC and BCH blockchains are completely identical up until the moment the fork happened. When the fork happened, two separate currencies were formed. So if you held BTC when the fork happened, you also got some 'free' BCH in the newly formed network.

At first I thought this was too stupid to be true but I think you may be correct. Now the question is why the hell would they do that? 
Other exchanges keep the majority of their BTC in a few big cold wallets but this doesn't seem to be the case for Coinbase.
If you're right and they're actually moving around the BTC in the backend, I wonder if some of it is related to trying to remain compliant with CFTC regulations. (Since they now offer margin trading.) 
Bitfinex was technically in violation of some [CFTC rule]( partially because they weren't doing this (and they weren't delivering Bitcoin to traders every 28 days or something). CFTC has shown that they're intent on [enforcing archaic commodity trading rules]( on to cryptocurrencies instead of adopting regulations that actually make sense.

Yea it gets even sillier than that..

I agree this is a very poorly written article. It's basically plagiarized clickbait. It's also [old news.](

Shitty article but not fraudulent. If you have some money and a PACER account you can buy the court documents [here]( and be 100% sure.
What I did find curious is that there are 513.1490393 BTC but only 512.9274588 BCH. Where'd the extra 0.22 BTC come from or the extra 0.22 BCH go? 
edit: here's the [document]( as provided by [arstechnica]( 
These are the values of BTC (and BCH) that they list. 
It sums up to 514.0239356 BTC and BCH. Whoever wrote that court document made a mistake with the arithmetic. 
It should be pretty easy to find the wallet addresses by searching the blockchain for wallets containing those values but I haven't done it yet.

Misleading title but Ghana *does* have a very interesting but little known history when it comes to currency and it's a great example of why Bitcoin is great.

TL/DR: Coinbase is actually one of the harder exchanges to track 'on-chain'.
There are a lot of reasons to hate Coinbase but their approach to keeping deposits and withdrawals private/ difficult to analyze on the blockchain is not one of them.
The short answer to your question is no, Coinbase doesn't keep the BTC at a separate address for each user and 'nebulous' is actually a good description of the addresses they control.
Most exchanges go \[user deposit address\] --&gt; hot wallet --&gt;\[user withdrawal address\] (sometimes also sending BTC or other cryptos to cold storage). Most exchanges also have static user deposit addresses whereas Coinbase generates a new address for each deposit. 
Coinbase will often send BTC from a deposit address almost directly to a withdrawal. Of course, sometimes multiple small deposits are combined to make a large withdrawal, or vice versa.

Arbitrage bots aren't anything unethical/nefarious. Say for example at GDAX the BTC/LTC price is 0.04 BTC per LTC and at Poloniex it's 0.03 BTC/LTC. The arbitrage bot buys 10 LTC at Poloniex and sells 10 LTC at GDAX at the same time. Netting a profit of 0.1 BTC. 
Eventually, the arbitrageur runs out of BTC at Poloniex and LTC at GDAX. So he (or his bot) sends BTC from GDAX to Poloniex and vice versa with the LTC. 
If the bots doing this go down, then when buyers at GDAX/Coinbase want LTC at GDAX, they have to pay a premium. (ie: a week ago this happened). 


In a very simple bot this would be true. Normally with anything more complex, people prefer to backtest their strategy before running it, which would take a lot longer than 10 seconds (tricky to do when it's a new market). 
The script that works for Bitcoin won't work identically to the one for ETH/LTC/BCH because of differences in market behavior and transfer time between exchanges.
It's possible the Picasso didn't backtest and that would explain the weird behavior. Just seems bloody reckless to me. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 20:32:29
Don't worry. I've read the report multiple times. It's not balanced. You can't possibly say that the stuff they wrote about Kraken (and Huobi/gate.io/Binance, 3 exchanges that I'm actually not a big fan of) is impartial or fair.
Specifically, saying stuff like they "might not limit the access of employees or other insiders to non-public or otherwise sensitive information, or monitor employees trading to ensure that other customers are not being placed at a disadvantage." Here's the thing, the exchanges that *DID* respond might also not limit that information. They just said they did because why would they say otherwise?
A lot of it is factually incorrect.
Here's their 'key findings':


They don't define 'abusive' trading activity. I assume it's spoofing/wash trading? If I notice a lot of spoofing and shit on an exchange I stop using that specific exchange. Wash trading costs the wash trader trading fees and sorry but if you use something as easily cheatable as volume on an exchange that doesn't specifically claim to monitor for wash trading as a trade indicator, that's your problem.


Actually... First rule of crypto is don't leave your crypto in an exchange. If you choose to do it anyways, it's pretty easy to audit funds. A lot of exchange addresses are labeled on popular block explorers (ie: on [Etherscan.io]( and if they aren't then it's normally easy to find the exchanges hot/cold wallets by following your own deposits/withdraws (the big exception being Coinbase who has different architecture).
There's even a peer-reviewed method for exchanges to prove solvency. See Dagher, G.G., et al. (2015), unfortunately I don't know of any exchanges that have adopted these proofs yet.


I found this one ironic. Attempts at regulation will only *raise* the barrier to entry for those who want to start a new cryptocurrency exchange which *will concentrate power in the few who can meet burdensome regulations.* This will allow a select few to profit from "non-public information". If you just let the market grow somewhat organically, a large number of exchanges will continue to pop up, spreading out the power, and the exchanges that users like and trust will gain popularity and if they start acting poorly, some kids in a garage will make a newer, better platform.

I think you missed the point. BCH miners are still getting block rewards. Today, BCH miners aren't getting a lot of transaction fees because their blocks are largely empty and there is no fee market. If BCH use grew significantly, BCH miners would also start earning money from fees. 
BTC miners are getting block rewards + transaction fees. Recently, the percentage of mining revenue from [fees]( has been pretty high (~5 BTC per block) because the network has been congested and there is a fee market but this has not always been the case. 
Of course, via lightning network, BTC will soon be able to scale to billions of trustless off-chain transactions per day.

"*Tether Used to Manipulate Price of Bitcoin During 2017 Peak: New Study*" is a great headline if you're participating in an organized effort to short sell Bitcoin.
Unfortunately, "*Tether Has No Real Impact on Bitcoin price: University Researcher*" does not have the opposite affect, so there's no reason for those outlets to publish it. (In fact, this paper has actually been available since roughly 1 month after the original Tether paper but most of us are just hearing about it now.)
The real issue here is that Bloomberg hyped up that FUD tether article which had very dubious findings and was conducted by researchers who likely had conflicts of interest. 
The original Tether manipulation paper was a great example of [data dredging]( combined with journalists who probably have no training as scientists or data anlysts.

While I appreciate bitfinex'ed's research and the Spoofy stuff, I'm not sure he's correct here. 


I arbitrage between GDAX and a few other exchanges and this happens occasionally when there is a lot of new demand. (new users buying through Coinbase drive up GDAX price. Also New Yorkers who are restricted to GDAX and Gemini).
When there is a lot of buy pressure from new users on Coinbase, arbitrageurs hit their withdraw limits on GDAX or the other exchange they're arbitraging from and the price differences get all fucked up. A week ago, there was a period of time where LTC/BTC price was over 15% higher on GDAX compared to other exchanges.
Also, occasionally one of the big arbitrageurs' bots will go down for some reason. (I know this because I figured out their Poloniex deposit address.)
Then there's the BCH part: 




This necessitates that the Picasso bot knew BCH was going to be implemented on Coinbase and already had the appropriate code implemented. It seems unlikely to me. 


While I certainly agree that no rational human being would buy 95 BCH at $8500, this is crypto and wealthy 27 year olds have thrown away more money than that with irrational trades on GDAX. (Remember the [Ethereum flash crash]( 
I haven't thought about this as much as bitfinex'ed and obviously it needs to be investigated (preferably by an independent team). But I'd urge caution in jumping to conclusions.

I disagree. It is negative and accusatory -- particularly with regards to Kraken.
For example this passage from the AG report:


It's misleading. Use of the word '*admitting*' implies that Kraken was involved in some misdeeds or was conceding a point. They weren't. Here's the passage where Kraken said "scams are rampant":


Then they throw a bunch more shade at Kraken with literally zero evidence, saying Kraken "might" be doing unethical/illegal stuff because they didn't respond to the survey. 
Powell's original blog post contains a well-reasoned response explaining why Kraken didn't comply with the NY AG's demands and fill out their form. To retaliate, NY AG is slandering (and apparently reporting) Kraken. I'd be really pissed off if I were Kraken too.

How do you think Bitfinex manipulates the price of BTC? 'Volume' doesn't control the price. It's real buy orders and real sell orders that control the price. The only way I can think of for Bitfinex to really manipulate the price is issuing more USDT than they have in their bank account and we haven't really seen much evidence for that other than the one research paper that claimed [weakly] that they might be doing that. 
I'd say that there's stronger evidence that the SEC and Bloomberg manipulate the price than there is that Bitfinex manipulates it. (The smoking gun is that SEC officials leaked confidential information to journalists which clearly affected price.) 
Even if Bitfinex and Binance are manipulating prices (you don't have to convince me that Binance is doing it on low market cap shitcoins) what is the government going to do about it? Malta is going to laugh their asses off if the NY AG tries to get Binance shut down.

Binance is the Wells Fargo of shitcoin exchanges, only worse.
They've done some shady shit that is just beginning to be documented. Nobody cared in December 2017 because we were all making money but their business model is  basically this:
* charge exorbitant fees for listings,
* list totally worthless shitcoins and market them to unsophisticated investors.
* make "liquidity agreements" with token developers (where they borrow the tokens, list them, and then market make on their own exchange, then return the tokens)
* make "trading contests" to pump up volume on shitcoins
* Not be transparent about their "API hacks" (we still [don't really know]( what happened there)
On the other hand, they're doing things like putting fees in their "insurance fund" which at least is pro-active for when they inevitably fuck up their security and admittedly, I use them occasionally when I want to test out a token that's not listed anywhere. And the front end is good.
Binance is full of red flags. A lot of people are going to butthurt when they inevitably lose all of the funds they have stored at Binance. Just don't say you weren't warned.

Cool analysis!
I see you used coinmarketcap for the trade volume. Has the exchanges included in Coinmarketcap's volume remained constant over that time period? I remember a long time ago they included the Chinese exchanges that charged 0% fees so volume was grossly inflated and frustratingly, 'analysts' who didn't know better came up with statistics like '[98% of BTC trade volume is in China]( I realize CMC started excluding certain exchanges from that statistic but I don't know the details. Might be worth looking at a select group of exchanges to get a better idea -- even divide them up by locale so we can see how volume has changed in China vs U.S. vs Europe, etc.
Also regarding tx count and tx volume, it may be worth pointing out that at least a small percentage of transactions (and potentially a bigger chunk of tx volume) may have moved to lightning network and liquid network.

I agree that you can't compel PayPal to do business with anyone. 
The problem is that regulations have raised the barrier to entry to a point where it's pretty much impossible to start a PayPal competitor. In addition to federal regulations like AML/KYC/PATRIOT act, almost every state has different money transmitter laws and ultimately you need to have a compliance/legal team in every state/territory you plan to operate in which is prohibitively expensive for a start-up.

These results also aren't typical. ~~(Also I think it's kind of weird that they have 200 nodes set up. A lot of nodes are hosted by Google so I wonder if that's these guys.)~~
Some more numbers: I've made about 50 Satoshis off my node in 2.5 months (and paid more than that in fees) but I only have 6-7 channels open and I think fees accrued scale almost factorially with number of channels open so maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way and should open more channels...
**edit**: They say they earned \~$185 in routing fees = \~0.03 BTC = 3 million satoshis. Even if they earned 2 Sats/tx, I'm very skeptical that they relayed 1.5M TXs. Satoshis.place has seen like a few hundred txs/day on average. I wonder if they were connected to some nodes that uploaded corrupted channel DBs and were penalized?

You're misunderstanding what I meant by off\-chain transactions. If I sell 1 BTC for 10 ETH on Coinbase, that's a transaction. Its value is secured by the network.

The beauty of blockchains is you don't have to take FSS's word for this and can verify it yourself :)
Tether uses both Ethereum and Omni for their tokens:
[  **"60,109,502.1043 USDT**"
[  "**2,770,000,000** **Tokens** "
=  **2,830,109,502.10** Tether tokens.
There are  **160,960,153.48** in [this Omni wallet]( which belongs to Tether and don't count as in circulation.
There are  **108,983** in [this Ethereum account]( which belongs to Tether as well.
There are **30,950,000** frozen Tether in [this address](
So we subtract the number of unissued, frozen and revoked Tethers from the number of total Tether tokens and we get  **2,638,090,365.62** Tether in circulation. (And about 600,000 that are "shareholder equity").
Hopefully I didn't make any major arithmetic errors.
This is significantly more than FSS said they had in their bank accounts on June 1st audit. I haven't checked but my guess is they either minted some new USDT on Ethereum or I noticed there are actually 4 more Omni wallets with frozen Tether: [**960,000**]( [**1,060,000**]( [**2,039,980**]( and [**940,000**]( that apparently aren't counted in Tether's calculation of "quarantined" tethers on their [website]( I'll look into the discrepancy after lunch.

I've never been a big fan of USDT (hoping DAI replaces it soon) so I figured I'd read their paper with an open mind. It's about 60 pages long so I haven't had time to read the whole thing but did look at the nice figures.
The actual paper is available here: [
Basically, they show that people minting Tether are exceedingly good at "buying the dip" and they probably bought about 50&amp; of the dips and if they didn't buy the dip crypto prices wouldn't have gone up as much. (I guess the evidence for this is pretty strong, but I wouldn't call this manipulation if they really have the money.)
The more interesting suggestion is that the Tether issuer is buying BTC during the month and then dumping it at the end of the month for USD so that their bank account shows the correct amount of USD. I think the statistics aren't as good on this.
Personally, I'm skeptical that the Tether people would be crazy enough to keep up this scam after being subpoena'd by the SEC (\~Dec 14th) which is why I'm not particularly worried.
But we should stop using USDT. It's a shitcoin \-\- retail investors can't even convert USD to USDT themselves, and can't redeem USDT for USD (afaik) so it's not the same as USD.

That's just  your definition of reclamation. It's not electric turbo compounding but you're still using energy that'd otherwise be lost. 


You're making a broad generalization about what is more efficient. 
If I want to heat my bedroom, it's more efficient for me to buy a space heater (or 2 GPUs) and run them than it is to install a heat pump in my house and heat the entire house. If a consumer (or a business) is in a place with cheap hydro or geothermal electricity, the energy savings from a heat pump may take 10-20 years to realize over an electric heater after you take installation costs into account. **4 million U.S. households** choose an electric water heater over the alternatives each year. **8 million households** buy electric space heaters each year.  If you replace those with miners(which some companies are already trying to do), you're not only generating heat, but also securing the bitcoin network, which has some economic value.


It's not the solution for every single community ever. If you're building a planned community or a large campus it's feasible depending on electric costs. Obviously retrofitting is more difficult.

Unless you live in an area with expensive gas and cheap electricity it usually doesn't make sense to heat your entire home with electric. (Obviously there are some places where this is the case but it's an exception.)
However, a benefit to electric is you can heat a very specific room. So heat your home office during the day, move the heater/miner to your living room in the evening and bedroom at night.
Then you're just heating 1 room instead of the whole house and actually saving heating energy that way.

If hashrate decreases the Bitcoin difficulty readjusts, making it easier for miners to solve a block. The network aims to maintain the difficulty at a level where a block is mined every ~10 minutes on average.

I don't have figures for number of people killed by heart disease during WW2 but it's less than 20M people per year worldwide today^[1]( and the world population was ~1/3 what it is today so let's guesstimate that it was 6M per year x 6 years = 36M. That's less than the number of people killed during WW2. 
Comparing WW2 to the U.S.'s current military engagements in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Somalia, Yemen and Pakistan is hilarious though. We should definitely be spending more on heart disease research than on those wars.

It's kind of a dick move to imply that a dude is guilty of a felony because he kept shitty records of his 'magic internet money' purchases in 2011... 
"flagged as suspicious by Kraken's bank" doesn't mean shit because we all know banks are overzealous with this stuff. 
Mid-2012 I sent someone $50 or $60 on PayPal and got about 10 BTC, then promptly forgot about it. 
I didn't keep proper records because (fortunately in my case there *was* a PayPal transaction and a corresponding BTC transaction and I never moved the funds so it was easy to prove when it came time to sell) but I can't blame a guy who got a couple hundred or thousand bucks for keeping shitty records.

This is an interesting and important point (as a bitcoiner I agree with) but you don't really explain it. I'm not actually sure what the best examples to explain it to no-coiners would be. Perhaps the secret service and DEA agents who got caught stealing BTC? 
I'm pretty sure, it'd be harder to launder a large amount of BTC than a large amount of cash *into the legacy financial system.*(it'd be easy to spend your DNM profits on DNMs, I guess.) As soon as you want to buy something that costs more than $10k from a law-abiding store, they have to report the payment to the IRS and with the blockchain it'd be hard to make the money look clean.

A fixed number of Bitcoin is released (12.5 BTC every ~10 minutes right now). 
Miners are competing against each other to be the first to solve a block and earn these 12.5 BTC + fees. 
If some miners find the BTC price is so low that they can no longer make a profit, then they will stop mining but that will increase the odds of solving a block first for the miners who are still mining. This makes it more profitable for them. 
If the value goes way down and it consistently takes the entire network more than 10 minutes to solve a block, then the 'puzzle' (hash) the network must solve to get the 12.5 BTC + fees becomes easier. 
So the network keeps itself functioning, regardless of price.

Adding on to that, the Nature Climate Change paper definitely didn't have any peer reviewers who understood how cryptocurrency works.
They make a bunch of provably false assumptions. For example:






The [Coinshares report]( credibly shows that the majority of mining power isn't using coal/gas/oil to mine (and mining wouldn't be profitable if they were).
Then here's the really bad part:


I'm too lazy to dig through this shit paper to find the exact numbers but here's a simplified version of their calculations:
They figured out the "average CO2 usage per transaction" using very controversial numbers. Roughly 100 kg of CO2/tx.
Then they assumed that every transaction in the future would use that same amount of CO2.
Then they projected that 314.2 billion transactions would occur ON-CHAIN. (This requires \~3 GB blocks).
So basically they get something like **314.2E9 txs/year \* 100 kg of CO2/tx = 31 Gigatons of CO2/year.**
Anybody who understands how scaling and BTC energy usage works knows that this is complete nonsense. The existence of LN pretty much disproves the paper... So I'm pretty sure they didn't have a peer reviewer who understands this.
As a scientist, this shit really pisses me off because junk science like this ends up making people distrust the real, properly carried out experiments. I considered writing an angry letter to the editors but decided my time was better spent doing other stuff.

Saying Bitcoin only has value "as a currency" is like an Econ 101 argument. Comparing Bitcoin to currencies that came before it is an apples and oranges comparison. Nothing before Bitcoin had:
* uncensorable transactions
* Predictable issuance
* Low-cost microtransactions (1 satoshi LN transactions?!)
* Multi-signature control of money (and coming soon ™ , more complex organizational control of money)
* All of the smart contract stuff (currently mostly on other blockchains but coming soon ™  to Bitcoin)
All of those properties give it value. Especially the smart contract stuff when you get into game theory. (See Augur and MakerDAO on the ETH blockchain for good examples of how you need the above properties to enable applications that were impossible without decentralized electronic money.)

It's pretty easy. Anybody can download a number of hacked BTC-related databases. (bitcointalk database, btc-e database, etc.) 
Then the scammer takes the list of BTC-related e-mails and cross references it with another database that includes full names. 
Now the scammer has a list of BTC users' full names and e-mail addresses. (Also in many cases username, password hash, DOB, meatspace address, ssn, all sorts of other private data depending on what database they're using.)
 Anybody with a semester of computer science class should be able to write a script that does this. Then just send out some spam e-mails.

There are a number of factors that contribute to fiat currencies failing. Obviously every currency that has failed has had unique factors precipitating its failure.
It's \[usually\] not just 1 of these factors, but rather a combination of them. Here's some examples.
* War. If your country gets rekt, nobody wants your currency anymore (sometimes your country doesn't even exist anymore. **Loads of examples of this**). War is expensive and incentivizes people in power to print a lot of money to cover their debts (**Confederate States of America, Chinese civil war**). If you lose a war or get invaded, the victor usually exploits your economy (**Greece - WW2**).
* Hyperinflation -- this is actually a really effective way for fiat issuers to get stuff done *until* people realize what's up. (**Hungary - 1946**) Historically, it's taken people months, years, or even decades to realize how hyperinflated their currencies are (**Roman Denarius**).
* Corruption -- if you control the money printing presses you can pay your buddies whatever you want (**Yugoslavia**) and eventually it leads to distrust and hyperinflation.
* Counterfeiting -- **French assignat** was one of the first currencies to fail back in the 1790s. **Phillipines** in the WWII is another good example of counterfeiting leading to decline of fiat. **CSA** is a well-known example although I believe the counterfeit currency in circulation was only a few percent of total amount.
Again, these are over simplifications of very complex events but it's *usually* some combination of these factors.

If you know the exact amount of BTC seized (which most criminal cases I've looked at give) it's pretty easy to identify the wallet... 
For example in today's FBI seizure report: "18-FBI-000898: 9.33308595 Bitcoin from a Bitcoin wallet associated with Randall Zandstra, valued at $90,131.38,
seized by the FBI on November 01, 2017 from Randall Zandstra in Longmont, CO for forfeiture pursuant to 21
U.S.C. 881."
google 9.33308595 and you get this address:  (the other 22 btc were also seized from him). 


Worth pointing out that the Monero seized from Cazes can not be traced. Because DOJ gave a public address instead of a public viewkey.

This is a common misconception. 
Your professor read some crappy article that misinformed him about how mining works. (My guess is [this one]( which was republished by some bigger news outlets.)
Tell him to read the white paper for starters (and you should too so you understand the theory behind mining!): 
A limited amount of energy will *not* hinder bitcoin mining. 
The network sets up a puzzle that miners must solve. If the puzzle is too easy and miners are solving it very fast, the entire network makes the puzzle more difficult. Conversely, if the puzzle becomes too difficult because electricity is too expensive to make mining profitable for most miners, then the network makes the puzzle easier. The target (right now) is that 12.5 BTC are mined every ~10 minutes. 
So if electricity actually does become scarce and electrical prices (worldwide) go up dramatically relative to the BTC price (like 5x in a week) then the network may be slower for a few weeks until the difficulty readjusts. 
The other option is ask him how much electricity he thinks the BTC network will use in 2019. If he says " the bitcoin network will require more electricity than the entire United States" (from the article) then you've got him. 
The U.S. uses ~4 trillion kWh per year. At $0.1/kWh that's $400B. At 1800 BTC mined per day, 657000 per year, you get a price of $608828 worth of electricity being expended per BTC mined. **Why would miners spend $608828 mining 1 bitcoin if it's not worth that?** If your professor sincerely believes the Bitcoin network will use that much energy in the future, he'd be stupid not to buy some ;)

Kraken is the latest target in what seems to be Bloomberg-backed shorting of crypto markets and this post is a reasonable response to that nonsense.
The [Bloomberg article]( in question doesn't make any sense... **They're trying to make it seem technical and quantitative but it's devoid of facts to back it up.**


.... It's arbitrage between USD and USDT. WTF are they talking about the "normal rules of economics"... Good thing they have a bunch of charts right?
Bloomberg repeats this illogcal stuff again: "the price of Tether is inconsistently changed by large and small orders to buy or sell the coin." Tether is pegged to the dollar. **Ostensibly, you can redeem 1 USDT for 1 USD at Bitfinex.** (I'm not a fan of USDT and I hope it gets replaced by multi-collateral Dai or another good stablecoin in the near future, but clearly the market tends to believe that their USDT are backed by dollars.) That's why the price isn't changed dramatically by large and small sell orders.


A lot of this is explained by **cross-exchange arbitrage. You can't look at just one market.** I just checked the USDT/USD market on Kraken. If I bought about $750k worth of USDT on Kraken, the price would go up about $0.0006. The guy who had just sold me the $750k would then try to buy back his $750k USDT on another market that offers USDT/USD (ie: Bitfinex) and eventually he'll send it to Kraken. He can even do "triangular arbitrage"! He could, for example, use the USD that I gave him for USDT to buy BTC, then sell BTC at another market for USDT, netting him more USDT than he sold me! I can't claim to know anything about forex, but I've been arbitraging cryptos for at least 5 years and that's the way crypto markets work. The Bloomberg article fails to mention this.
This part of the Bloomberg article is hilarious:


If you want to "cheat" by colluding with automated trading programs (unclear how/why someone would cheat/collude on USD/USDT markets but let's pretend they are), you have two ways to do it:
1. Use weird numbers on a publicly viewable order book to communicate with other bots.
2. Set up an encrypted channel between colluders over the internet.
Why would anybody ever use option  (which would be putting the evidence in public) when they could hide it in private???
Then they have a bunch of charts showing stuff like that someone spent $37.5 on Tether and the price increased by  0.0002. And then they spent $37.5 on Tether and the price didn't increase?!?!!!!! Again, it's nonsensical. Market fluctuations are kind of random. They're also affected by the pricing of other assets on other exchanges.
This is a particularly stupid quote:


Why would anybody pay $1.10 for a Tether if they *know* that the price is going to go back down to $1.00 in a very short period of time... A tether simply isn't worth $1.10. If I want to send value from one exchange to another, Tether is a great way to do it and sometimes it's worth paying $1.01, but at $1.10 I can transfer value with LTC or BTC or something because at $1.10 the premium on USDT would outweigh the benefits of lower volatility.
These lines say SO MUCH:


1. This guy listens to Bitfinexed. If Bitfinexeds' posts are enough to influence your opinion then you have no idea WTF you're talking about. His posts on Picasso and Spoofy make grand allegations and are accompanied by videos of... order books changing...
2. He admits he's short BTC. Now we know his motivations
These "experts" they're citing clearly aren't experts on cryptocurrency trading and are entering into fraud territory...

Assuming OPs numbers are correct, I did the math for Bitcoin vs Gold (someone double check it):
World gold market cap is about $8 trillion.  $8 trillion divided by 475 million GJ =  $16842 worth of gold exist per GJ being spent on mining.
For Bitcoin it's =  $121 Billion divided by 3.6 million GJ= $33611 worth of BTC exists per GJ being spent on mining
However, I don't think market cap is the right thing to normalize by. IMO, what matters is how much value gold mining is producing vs how much value Bitcoin mining is producing.
About 3000 metric tons of gold are mined per year. At $40/gram that comes out to **$120,000,000,000 worth of gold mined per year.**
You have 1800 BTC mined per day \* 365 days per year =  657,000 bitcoin \* $6500 comes out to **$4,270,500,000 worth of BTC mined per year.**
Divide that by the amount of energy expended according to OP and you get:
**$253 worth of gold produced for 1 GJ** of energy expended mining gold and  **$1186 worth of bitcoin produced for 1 GJ of energy expended**.
Now, I'm not certain OPs numbers are correct (they sound plausible for gold but I feel like BTC uses more than that), but this would suggest that the Bitcoin network is more efficiently producing value than gold mining is.

In a few days I hope to have my own node up and running and will just connect eclair to that. 
I think the issue with the ACINQ node is channels got exhausted because everyone connected to it could only send, not receive. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:27:12
The main problem I had was I opened my first lightning channel to the ACINQ node (because there's a button there that makes it very easy) and kept getting errors when I tried to make payments. 
I didn't look too much into the cause of the errors (and didn't save the error msgs) but I think the problem was lots of people using Eclair are connecting to that node and sending money but can't receive it which is causing the channels to be exhausted. 
For now, I would recommend opening a channel to [one of these nodes]( since they're all probably pretty liquid. 
This won't be an issue in a few weeks once the network grows more. 
Aside from that, I thought everything else was slick. Bitrefill posted [easy-to-follow instructions]( on how to make your first payment.

Here's what I'm doing with mine while I wait for the network to mature: 
* Read/write shitposts on [yalls]( 
* [Buy]( shit I don't need. 
* Write my own lightning app. 
* Pay other nerds who are also running LNDs. 
* Decorate my node, post on Reddit for karma.

Maybe give it a few months to grow organically? 
There's enough liquidity for microtransactions now. 
When coffee shops start accepting lightning BTC then more channels worth a few cups of coffee will be opened. 
When utility companies start accepting lightning transactions then channels worth whatever a coffee shop spends on electricity each quarter will be opened. 
etc.

A year ago today the price was ~$1100. Most sane people would've said hitting $19k in 2017 was impossible. 
Personally, I think the completion of lightning network and a few other similar-sized projects this year will act as a catalyst.

The target audience isn't the 'average' consumer *yet* (especially for Monero, which was the first crypto to use this design). 
Also this is on a university campus so hopefully a few students think about the meaning of the sign critically as they're walking by.

The first step is setting up a lightning node. (This is pretty easy, look up the raspberry pi builds.) 
The second step is figuring out how to build your point-of-sale setup. I guess you'd probably want to use [Blockstream's Nanopos.](
Honestly, it's probably too early though. Very few people have installed mobile lightning wallets.
IMO, you're better off just accepting 0-conf transactions. If someone wants to steal from you, they're going to shoplift. Not abuse 0-conf bitcoin transactions.

This is not true. The [store is still selling stickers.]( 
The problem is the main page (  ) says "We recommend" and then shows tshirts and hoodies. But if you click 'Shop' it takes you to the stickers as well. 
IMO it's a poor UI choice on Blockstream's end but on the other hand this is equivalent to visiting amazon.com and saying Amazon only sells things that you see on the landing page.


I don't know what version of eclair the author is using but for me it [clearly shows the USD value of BTC]( below the BTC value when I'm opening a lightning channel.

No, I think that website defaults to showing the BCash chain now so the ones you're seeing at the top of the page are on their chain. 
The website goes back to years before the hard fork but the site followed the other fork, presumably because big blocks are more amenable to this sort of nonsense.

Nope you can't send it out. From their [FAQ]( 








OP -- this isn't what Bitcoin is about. You're not actually buying Bitcoin if you can't withdraw it. 
I'd recommend making an account at a real Bitcoin exchange, buy a few dollars worth, withdraw it and hold it in your own wallet.

I open channels with businesses where I make recurrent purchases when fees are low ([1 sat/byte]( right now, not $30 as stated in the article you linked).
I may also receive some payments from some people. I assume they will also open a channel if fees are particularly low. If I can earn back more than like 300 Sats from a channel I opened, then I've made a profit.

You can hear his own words in this video and do your own interpretation/analysis so you don't have to rely on NYPost's analysis. 
Anyways, the tweeter is correct... The guy says you can use cash to buy crypto.
With a little critical thinking, this may lead to the conclusion that there will be less of a paper trail for crypto purchases in India than if they were made using the legacy banking system.

About a year ago I helped a friend convert about $20k USD to BTC to a foreign currency and she actually made a profit over the fx rate because BTC price was slightly higher in the other country and I guess arbitrage in and out was difficult for most people. 
I'd recommend that anybody converting significant amounts of money (ie when you're moving to a new country) at least explore using BTC for conversion.

I have a decent collection. Not just hyperinflation but other demonetized currencies as well. 
I have a partial spreadsheet so I'm transcribing it quick and dirty and partially from memory.  
Here's countries to look into.  Sorry I don't have highest denomination listed for all of these but you're smart, you can figure it out. 
* Nicaraguan Cordobas
* French Assignat
* Burma 75 kyat notes (demonetization)
* Russian Rubles (1991? Demonetization)
* Russian Rubles (current, I wanna say 100k is biggest)
* Brasil 100k cruzeiro
* Afghanis (10,000)
* Chinese Yuan (1949-1950)
* Venezuela (current)
* Mexico 500,000 pesos (~1994)
* Austria 10,000
* Weimar Republic marks
* Yugoslavia, Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia, etc. 
* Cambodia Riel (Pol Pot, interesting demonetization history)
* Hungarian Pengo
* Ghana 50 cedi (demonetization)
* Greece WW2
* Israel (1970s)
* Mozambique 
* Phillipines Japanese Occupation
* Zaire 
* US Continental Currency
* Poland (2M Zlotych)
* Belarus
* Turkey (current)
* Uruguay 1992 (500,000 pesos)
* Danzig (1923)
* Transnistria
* Iran (current)
* Peru 5M intis (~1990)
* Angola (1M Kwaanzas)
* Bolivia
* Ukraine (1M Karbovantsiv)
* Flying Tang cash (China)
* Roman double denarii (heavily debased coins)
* Both North and South Korean won
I know I'm missing a few. Moral of the story: don't trust a central authority to handle your money.

Is anybody actually trying to raise funds to start a liquidity-providing business?
I'm running a lightning node with the hope that it might help offset the fees for all those microtransactions I plan on doing and maybe receive some payments. Not as a business itself.

If I've routed someone else's payment, is that not providing liquidity?

Legit question: what ZK proof layer are people using?


I'm not saying it wouldn't be preferable to have a ZK layer on Bitcoin in the future. Just expressing my opinion that **it's stupid and douchey to dismiss all other projects as not "ever matter\[ing\]"**.
There are plenty of people who need Monero *right now* and it is an important project that does matter.
As for Rootstock, I haven't been following it very closely so I could be ignorant but I'd say there are legit projects on Ethereum (MakerDAO, Augur are my favorites) that I don't think have parallels on Rootstock.
@_date: 2018-12-12 16:43:01


You clearly don't understand Monero's use-case.
(And I'd argue that there are currently at least a few non-scam use-cases where Ethereum is better than Bitcoin as well.)

\~250 bytes per basic transaction (1 input, 2 outputs).
10 billion people making 1 basic transaction per day\*250 bytes=  2.5 terabytes per day.
They'll need like 17 GB blocks. Should be feasible assuming all miners and nodes are located in the same data center.

I'd actually argue that adoption is going pretty well in the countries where the use case is obvious. ie: Venezuela [
I think 2019 is the year that really seamless/user-friendly blockchain apps hit the market and the average smartphone user can start using LN, etc. We'll see continued adoption in hyperinflation countries like Venezuela, South Sudan, Zimbabwe.
Then other countries with high (but not hyper) inflation, such as Argentina and Turkey start to adopt BTC as a hedge against USD and precious metals.
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:51:27
Not trying to be pedantic but my initial comment was simply pointing out that some altcoins do have legit use-cases and are being used right now, hence they certainly do "matter".  
Aside from coinjoin, which is great (but inferior to Monero in terms of anonymization), none of those have public mainnets yet afaik. Liquid is cool but there's still certain temporal attacks that can be used to deanonymize or track those coins if a user converts between BTC and L-BTC and isn't extremely careful. (Kind of like was done here in section 8.2:

Every taxi driver I've ever met has exaggerated but I'm not sure your numbers are quite correct:


I checked a few of the approved payment processors for London taxi cabs and they **charge 2.5-5%**, and some bundle in equipment rental fees or try to make you use their additional services (dispatch, accounting, etc.)
[Here's one that's a flat 3.75%]( \+ 20p. (Seems reasonable, Square, which is a big player in mobile point-of-sale services, charges 2.75%.)


At 3.75% it comes to £3,200 per week, £166,400/year. That's revenue, not how much he's "making".
Last time I was in London I remember a cab costing roughly £1 per minute to/from the airport. So to make £3200/week in revenue, he'd need to have a fare for 53 hours/week. I believe they're limited to 65 hours of work per week (I could be wrong though, it may be less) and I'm not sure what percentage of the time the cab is actually driving a fare.
The taxi driver might've been exaggerating a bit, or he may have been citing a particularly rough week, but it's not way off.
