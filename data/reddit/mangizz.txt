Thanks a lot.
Don't we have a problem of communcation? I'm talking about China, something should be done, to have more communication between EUR/USA and China. 
Bitcoin seems to lack hard about governance and something should be done to decide how to proceed for a hardfork, more than what will be in the harkfork. Nop?
Because anyway one day we will need to HF this is sure.

Just don't do it, even with some open mind people with "high" education, it's just impossible, if you don't have DAYS, because they will try to understand how it's exactly works, and it's hard to understand (even if they think they are smart...). Even harder to EXPLAIN IRL, because if you really love bitcoin you are acting like a fool a bit. Because you start by "it's cool because... free, limited etc..." and you finish by "IT'S A FUCKING REVOLUTIONNNNNNN IT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHINNNNNNNNNNNNG" yes, yes....
With some average people who don't really understand money, internet and stuff like that, it's better. They just understand the benefit (instant free transfert), and maybe the store of value it's "limited". 
Now you clearly need to say I'am a happy bitcoin user and i don't have time to really explain why but here is some short explication, and why i think state currency are doom. I believe people will understand bitcoin crysis after crysis, maybe i'am wrong (we will not have a currency crysis...), at least its my way to see it :)

I bought 2 months ago for the halving, and because i had enough cash at this moment of course.

Volatility is very fun for smart people, because they know it's will go up and up anyway. And they just take pleasure look at people panic.
Just buy.
When you have cash, you buy. 
That's the rules, trying to get a good amount of bitcoin before it'S too late.
After Mtgox crash + China . I'm very confident about Bitcoin, people think the drop was huge, but let's me tell you for me it just showed how bitcoin is strong. The major exchange crash and Bitcoin stay at 400$ something like x3 the price post bubble, with the most horrible news of Bitcoin history.
@_date: 2015-06-02 04:00:22
it's the best solution by far... In 2020-2025 we will have an answer if bitcoin failed as mainstream or not, so dont start to worry about storage. lol...
If it's mainstream a lot of early will be rich enough to buy the lastest HD on the market to run a node.
If it's not mainstream it will be easy to find a solution between the remain user/miner etc...
However start at 4mb with 20% increase should be largely ENOUGH :)

Why don't just fund a pool ? We have a lof of new millionaires in dollars with BTC.
They need to care of the system, they need to raise money and fund competitive pool. It's must be a priority, it's like 1 year Ghash have a monopoly, we need reaction from who lead BTC.
I dont have a lot of BTC but i will surely invest few bucks in outsource mining system if it can make GHASH.io go down. 
Miner will realise : more they go with Ghash more people who dont really care about profit will invest and difficulty will rise. Everybody will lose. 
is not possible ? just do it :(
If some leader can make it happens a lot of smaller follower will invest for sure. Maximum hashrate 10%. When the pool rise 10% we open a new one if it's needed. If possible not in the same localisation USA, EUROPE, NORTH KOREA :D will make the takedown way lot harder.
Invest in hashrate is not like you are losing money, it's like you borrow money to the system to survivre. You will have your money back, it will just take sometime. It's like a saving account who give u interest but where you need to block your money in forever. :D
Mining is not mainstream, we need people able to "centralised" (yeah centralised to fight centralised) it and raise money. The whales have more incentive  to do, hey guy, you become very weathly with Bitcoin, time to give litte bit of time to the system who make you rich. If you are a early adopter you are a believer, you can't accept Ghash to go that high, it was one of the most important warning from Satoshi. We are already very unaware. Even something like 30-35% hashrate is huge.
It's your responsability to do something to preserve the system, stop wait people make it happens for you, you have money you need to invest it. With few hundread thousand $ (few whales can found it) it enough to make something start.
If you are a whales you don't need to work for live i believe, so use your time in an useful way for everyone. Put 25% of your saving in mining, and a safe and large place where we can start to bulding a massiv pool, you can take the risk. Mining stuff worth something, Borrow money to the system, when it's done make an huge topic with picture, make a website also, call the raise from the community. we will make it for sure, we just need few hundred thousands to start. We need someone who have TIME and MONEY to do it. Dont you want be the savior of BTC? I'm 100% it's will lead a new way to see mining. 
Mining is not only about PROFIT. The maximum returning roi is fixed an investor should be fixed like 110% MAXIMUM all calculate in Bitcoin, you fund 1 bitcoin, you will receive MAXIMUM 1.1BTC for example After that the funder is not in posession of the hashrate anymore.
Money go in the company wallet transparent wallet, and fund are used to do whatever is good for Bitcoin.
I'm far to be an expert of mining, but i think it's realistic, if someone have an idea how much it needed to start a pool like this, and if it can be profitable overall? (I believe yes, maybe install it where electricity cost is low, and where location rent is low aswell, i think if the first pool is outside US, it can be a good thing also, like East europe, south america sound better.)
It's the thing who make me kind of sad about bitcoin, selfish... most of the whales keep it in cold storage wallet. Invest it in bitcoin, you took the risk of bitcoin so early for what ? If you invest it, you not take a risk, it's make you safer, because the Bitcoin itself become safer.

Smarter than the average people ? Yes i think it's pretty OBV, really i don't like them, but it's like politics we don't like them, but of course they are smarter than the average joe, or at least well more educated.
Trader for example, it's sad but they have often a really good mathematic formation. They can do whatever they want but they choose trading which is for me horrible work. Bank win a lot of money, they pay a lot, so they have the power to recruit the best element of each country.
So yeah they are.... They are not THAT smart is more because average people are VERY DUMB. (turn on your TV 2hours and you will understand what i try to say :D)

I think the main idea to start is to have a democratic forum.
Here is some ideas :
* All forum are free to read to anyone on internet. 
* System of member with annual fee. (Member need to be verified)
* Only member can open topic, downvote and upvote. A reddit system like.
* If the organisation go far and it's a bit of mess, you can start a new forum, member can vote for someone representative. Only elected people can open topic, downvote and upvote (down&amp;upvote are public).
After that's there is a lot of other things to do of course, but i think, it's a good way to start, if you want to build something democratic, forum is the main thing, and surely the easiest and cheaper way to start. When it's done, you can start to think of building a real decentralised organisation.
Fee is here to be sure voter are serious about Bitcoin and not casual or troll, like we can see on reddit. Don't know about the cost, can be lowered or up after vote. Fee are collected and go into a multisign wallet with at least 5 wellknow member of bitcoin community, who gonna be in charge to spend it the more transparent way possible, all transaction need to be signed and public ofc
This is just an example, and for me that's why one month clearly it's a bit short, hope OP will review the deadline to 3months minimum.

yes but i'm someone who moove a lot around, i dont have any home to store backup because i moove so often. I dont trust hardrive very much (2 HD crash in 1 year... lol).
So if i have local wallet it's cool, but backup will need to be always mooved etc, i feel it's not really safe, when you don't have a safe life lol.
Online blockchain seems very secure by the way they works. Wallet is on the cloud, but i have also few physical backup with me in case of something happen to the website. If i lose backup i'm still fine, If website is unacessible i'm still fine. If you do not use an infect computer, i don't know if you can be really hacked if you don't do critical mistake, like let's a backup copy of ur wallet in your mailbox. 
Any suggestion for someone like me ? I feel online is the safer way.

Almost 2 years i'm involve in bitcoin (i mean understand it and push it to my friends and over internet...). I start to be used to (i don't really care about charts anymore...), bitcoin become like a "normal thing" you know... Not like when i discovered it, so yeah i not really push it anymore. But we don't need to way people asking what is bitcoin, we just need to use it and explain.
This kind of video remind me how bitcoin is huge, and we need to push it all together because this technology IS the futur. Can't wait to see the next of this incredible story, poor middle joe guy who don't understand anything "bitoin tulip LOL", and whining all day about banking system. We've got some work to do, explain, explain, explain, never give up. It's not only about make profit, it's about change our internet and our world for the better.

Bitcoin with blockchain will succeed as a new technologie whatever regulator decide to do with this, you can limit it, but it's just a matter of time i think.
With some others technologies (3D print, IA, robotic, and much more) it will change the world in human organisation like nothing did in our past history.
We are coming in a new stage of human history, that's why the world is in crysis, new model is coming, and you need to be a fucking genious to bet where we gonna go, because nobody can know exactly.
The best we can do is adapt our world smoother as we can, or we gonna face large trouble.
I wish you good luck with law anyway... I don't think any law based on the old model will be applicable... The transition will take time, you firstly need to think the world as a really global thing now, because national mean almost nothing on the web where the main economics activity will happens in the near futur.

We don't care if bitcoin is cool or not.
This is a short term thing. The only question is how to make Bitcoin better, and everyday new idea are coming, revolution is here, we need people who can build tools.
Someday somehow average joe will have to face the truth, bitcoin outclass banking system and fiat currency.
I remember around 1998 i was maybe 13. People was just like " why this guy is spending so much time on internet..." and the same people are now on facebook 24/7 playing candy crush and criminal case stupid thing like this, in 1998 i was playing Starcraft...

Really i'm tired to see it everywhere, but really i don't understand some of you.
Bitcoin is designed to be very useful on internet and for trade something with someone who stay fairly far (far enough to not make the trade in person).
This is the main strength of bitcoin, is to replace national and international banking system money transfert.
Bitcoin OUTPERFORM already the old system who is slow, costly, not 24/7 etc...
Bitcoin CAN replace cash someday somehow, but really as a bitcoin believer, tomorrow i will not go pay for my noddle soup or my beer in bitcoin.
First of all, because i dont have any smartphone and i don't plan to use one ( i like to be not connected when i stay with friend or alone outside, computer and internet are my works and i will be so tired to read something about bitcoin or my business even at restaurant).
And simply because i think cash is perfectly OK in real life.
“Cash has been remarkably durable, even with the introduction of credit cards and debit cards and tap-and-go cards. If you look at the growth of cash in the economy, it’s grown roughly in line with the growth of nominal income.”
he is exactly right, i will not use bitcoin to buy a beer or buy some food, i will not use credit card also. Cash is good, because it's fast, h24, free to use (i know... shutup), etc...
I'm not saying bitcoin can't never replace cash, but really this is far to be the first objective. Even if you are totally again bankster and you see bitcoin like a shit who can make them fear, let's me tell you, cash is nothing if you compare with digital dollars or euro, tomorrow if international business start to be in bitcoin like : Customer pay company in bitcoin, who pay supplier in bitcoin, they are already in A LOT of trouble. (sorry for my english, i'm bad at it, and i write quickly this one, because this shit about cash vs bitcoin start to broke my ball a little :D)

You could be right about this, it's sure with 6BTC you are confortable here ;-) Even myself i'm ok, i was just sayin' if you are a regular drinker, smoker, need a car, and need to live in BKK, Visa, 6BTC can appear a LOT, but money go like crazy in Thailand, because you tentation to go out everyday is very important.  And you need to have some saving, because if you any trouble you will certainly pay a lot to get out of a mess.

China is the new Silkroad, when it's done price will rise, because the bottom has been tested.
There is no really reason for someone to sell at the bottom, and there is no reason to wait more to buy. + There is a lot of good news.
It's a very important moment i feel, i don't know how many buyer was waiting the bottom but if the price continue to rise, it can directly conduct to a kind of panic buy. Price will rise but i not pretend this can be the next bubble. Maybe we can go over 550 pretty quickly.

Of course stock is one of the coolest application for BTC.
The revolution is not because everybody can trade 24/7 on phone, for me is more because the fact that everyone can get funding.
We all know small team are way more efficient, crownfunding is cool but just for few things. Decentralised stock is a LOT better, innovation will explose. People will make company like they change socks, start to make product directly for customer. Customer will buy stock of the company they support.
Invest money will become like a vote. It's already like this for few people, but for the majority of the earth stock is handle by saving bank account with few % interest who cover hardly the inflation. People think bitcoin will make the economy worst, but it's untrue. People will invest the money when it will be safe.
Economic will be out of the dark age of bankster, where stock become useless as fuck for real economy (for me is not only useless its dangerous), where only huge company can use it (so they use it at an advantage vs smaller company because cashflow is insane with actual stock, and they just need to buy company who try to innovate) and so few people are able to trade on it.
Look at the stock right now, go up all time high, who believe the economy is better for the average person? Stock are more and more disconnected from reality
Internet is about decentralisation. Everything will be decentralised a lot of people will open company to do whatever they want, because it will be fast and easy. Think about auction before internet its was so centralised, expansive. Now everyone can sell in auction on internet, its crazy because is not over and everything will become like this. Their is thousands of example, we enter in a new era with the bitcoin standard.
I'm french and before bitcoin i was kind of socialist, because i was thinking the system is evil, and only state can regulate it to offer more egality. I'm not talking about everyone need to have the same wage, but everyone need to have a chance to do what they want to do. In this system is really hard to someone with energy and a good idea to make it true. Bitcoin can make liberalism the true way it need to be. So now i became a ultra liberalist, because bitcoin make the dream possible.
Everyone will be able to do trade, or product whatever they want. And if they don't have a lot of cashflow, they can go for Stocks and crownfunding. You will be able to start a project with 0$. That's crazy.

nobody come in Thaland to see Ping Pong show lol :D But yeah it's kind of a legends so there is some people who try it, why not, never been to a ping pong show and none of my friend aswell and we live here... (So i can't say if its really horrible or not :()
After i'm not saying there is no sexuel tourist in Thailand, but they not come for ping pong show ;-)
And 6 BTC as a foreigner is not a LOT in Thailand, especially in BKK, if you want something with european standard in the hearth of the city you already spent 1.5 BTC.
I spend almost 1500euros by months (4btc?), and i'm not a real drinker, no smoker, i don't have car, and i don't have "many girl friend". Just some party here and here, and some good food.
6BTC is far to be 10X the medium wage, because national wage mean nothing in Thailand, there is a lot of difference between someone living in Bangkok and a farmer from Issan. City where foreigner live such as Island (phuket, samui) - BKK - Pattaya and chiang mai, are cheap, but medium wage is more about 1 btc.
But yeah of course 6 BTC you are very confortable with, you can rent a big place, and go party 2 time a week, maybe at the end of the month you not spend everything :D

It's all depends about news i feel.
I feel it good. I don't see what kind of bad news can happen, to be at the level of the last down Mtgox + China :D I don't know how bitcoin resist that way, it's crazy. Now bitcoin look very very strong.
So i think market is waiting for good news
Before the end of 2014 The next "big" news, like paypal confirm working on bitcoin, will make a panic buy, bitcoin will be at all time high (1500$).
The difference with last time is now the huge media coverage. Bitcoin will take place on TV.
This will make wallstreet fear to enter too late in the game and will start to buy to be before mainstream. (5000$++) probably early 2015. The timing is perfect because it's seems like serious company to buy BTC for "pro" will come soon.
This will make politic to seriously look at Bitcoin, and the next USA campaign will have a bitcoin topic, so the world. Before this x2 less bitcoin will come in the market every 10 minute. Few months / Weeks before the halving people will realise it and the last big panic buy will happen (10k++)
This will make more coverage and speculation.
Overall i expect bitcoin to growth like crazy if silicon valley adopt it (will surely happen i feel), and the only thing who can stop it now is a REALLY bad news their is only two i think :
huge flaw discover in protocol (low probability)
Ban from USA, EUROPE ... (can happen... after a massive growth, Bitcoin with darkmarket and darkwallet will look very dangerous for the system, and it is, i hope about a national debat maybe in USA campaign 2016 ? I hope not before..)

I hope Satoshi is waiting for the global domination of bitcoin. After that him will make a huge announce. 1 million bitcoin has been placed on a multisign wallet
And him give away 100 000 key after a giant democratic vote on the blockchain, to who have the right to posses one of the key.
this million bitcoin will serve to etablish a right world.
:D :D :D
I don't know but satoshi need to do something great with it, but firstly him need to wait the stability and the domination of bitcoin, or he will destroy it.
What you can do with 1 million bitcoin  ? Nothing is way too much to one person, the best thing him can do is to think how to use it for the best.
But when bitcoin will become global, we can still try to convince him to do something with, we can talk about project and how to use this one million bitcoin, maybe he will listen, because i think it's a hard thing to handle alone (yes i do believe is alone, because its impossible to be so anonymous with a group of person) And he will need the approbation of the majority of the world to do something great. We can have this discuss in 10 years maybe.

This tattoo is directly inspired by Bitcoin, i mean all the new ideology i made behind it. I know some of you, will not agree, but it's a large part of BTC community, so maybe some of you might like the idea.
+ My recent life make me kind of "individual sovereign" this tattoo is made in this new era for me, where i choose to leave my country and live only by internet. (i had no formation about it, and start from 0 i mean i was good at using computer but that's it).
Overall is just to discuss how BTC idea change your mind, and how we can represent it by art... Reverse triangle and the eye is largely inspired by the darkwallet. I find the idea very cool. At the top left of the tattoo its for me represent the decentralised idea and power, and internet itself. And at bottom the electronic nature of all of this of course.
The tattoo is more about Bitcoin and internet than everything else, but the idea it's was just to be no so OBV for average people to think i refere at it, some of my friend think is directly connected to illuminati for example :D the idea is here yeah... But is not about anti-illuminati no.
If you have some cool stuff of this kind, share. I might be interested to continu this tattoo. In few months or years who know. I like symbolic art.

I'm not saying it's the perfect solution. You guys are talking always about P2P, it's wonderful we all know. But for now it's at 1% !!
Centralised organisation are way more easy to handle, because you can "invest in" and have a ROI, P2P is idealist (but can suceed no doubt). Centralised organisation is more easy to start, human work like this for thousand of years and it's working. We just need some balance Ghash is way too high, and we need to make a pool where the first objective will be to fix it.
 i think Centralised and p2p we can do both at the same time where is the problem? P2P it's about computer science programing skill and persuasion, centralised pool it's about $$$ and leadership. I don't have enough money to buy a real stuff for mining bitcoin to connect to p2p (and i dont want a mining station at home), also i dont have any knowedge in programing to help in p2p. We are 90% like this. Why not provide a mining contract to small investor. 
We can even think to a pool where the objective is to give the hashrate power to p2p pool. There is no problem about it. We need an organisation who collect the money, invest in mining stuff, give back bitcoin to people who invest. 
We just need more competition...
I'm 100% for p2p reach 100% one day, it's way better than centralised. But it's seems like miner just don't care about the distribution, we need people who dont care about mining to pay for fight against it. Selfish vs community. This is a balance.
We need also to take out the mining power from US, is not because we dont like you guys ;) We can do both at the same time, promote decentralised localisation and fight against evil pool. 
I'm not talking about 2020, we need to take care it quickly, i think it can start to be a major problem in bitcoin development. How can you expect Bitcoin to be credible one day... Ghash i'm tired of it, we need to fight it with money. Like i said more the rate of Ghash will be high more the incensitive to invest in other pools will be high, so competition will rise, miner will think 2 time before choosing a pool, now they are not very concern, we just talk and cry about how Ghash could be evil for MONTHS now, and nothing happened. Miner are selfish they look at 0.5% profit. We need a community pools who dont care about short term profit, but work the distribution of hashing power and decenstralisation localisation. It's possible to make bitcoin invincible, i just don't know why is not the first concern of this community. We all know cryptocurrency are here to stay, but bitcoin not 100% sure, mining is one the biggest problem.
Bitcoin millionaire have a really high interest to make bitcoin invincible i believe. Bitcoin is far to be invincible right now :) Too much hashing power in USA, too much Ghash power. I don't like say it, but we need to be realistic one minute, it's true. Even if is not that's bad, this is still a threat. The crazy thing is we know how to make bitcoin invincible, everything was say by Satoshi at first, the decentralisation is the main thing of bitcoin, we need community to take care the mining..

If the boss of the pool is someone know by everyone with a large amount of BTC will you not trust him?...
Or just why not make an transparent and democratic organisation to rules the pool.
What do you think is better 1 pool with 45% or 3 pools with 15% ? I don't understand the point.
Your point is buy mining contract make us in this situation.
You are wrong, what make us in this situation it's because mining contract are needed and useful, but only 1 company is able to provide it.
We need more pool able to "rent" hashrate, we need more competition in this sector, when you have 2 btc you can't afford a mining station, why just not fund one ? It's the only way to decentralised the mining market, is to make possible for small investor to buy some hashrate.
Like i said if the succes is here we need rules. like 10% max. Even less, 10% it's already a LOT. You can try to decentralised it to a maximum of localisation.
i'd love invest in company like this who can give me a 110% roi but even if i don't reach 100% feel like my bitcoin was spent in a right way. Like i said is not about profit. You invest to secure the network. 
You can imagine a lot of thing one not so bad IMO: a part of Benefice (if the 110% roi is reach) is after allowed to useful thing like node.
It's really easy to make a website explain to people why is a good bet to invest in this kind of pool, it's really easy to understand the benefit of decentralised mining and an "almost" no-profit organisation who work in the interest of the Bitcoin.
I feel like we need to take care about this security issu of mining, all of us. But like i said we need a leader first, because at first you need someone who have time and some money to do the first step. I'm sure people will follow, i can help to promote it for free, no problem.

@_date: 2014-05-03 01:40:47
Thanks you.
you are perfectly right. 
The 2 decimal you are all talking about is not usable in a near futur. 
I think mBTC could be perfectly fine for YEARS. I don't know why now people reverse their mind and all want "bits".
We have parity dollars/bitoin when the price is at "1000" and it's very acceptable even at 10 000$.
it's only if you want people think they have something valuable with this money.
Sorry but i'm maybe little bit dump, but when i go to asia and get some "kips", "baht" or some "riel" and their are in my pocket, i don't have the feeling that money is strong, and valuable at all. Majority of the world not using thousand (or even million in our case with BITS) something to buy food. China - Europe - North America using the same kind of "metric" for money. 
Big mac USA : 4$ | France : 3euro | China : 15yuans. (example) You can take example of lower money 
Thailand : 99baht.
With "bits" bitcoin will really look like something fresh and new "oh lol so cool i just pay 12 450 bits for my sandiwch" Yeah it's kinda "cool" try to pronouce it : "twelwe thousand four hundred fifty". LOL.
Do you think this is acceptable ?
I largely prefere "this sandwich cost me 12.45 mBTC"  : "Twelve, forty five"
Is not because bitcoin is designed to become extremly divisible, we need to use all the figure. Satoshi will never be used, or i will be billionaire with few BTC, come on guys... And one day if it's case will mean everybody on earth used bitcoin already, so we can go for "bits".
So Bits it's about delete decimal and start with price range 10k to 1 million. 
mBTC is more stay in the system who a large majority of the world know already with 2, 3, 4 figures with sometime decimal.
Going for bits now is very premature i think.
For me the coolest thing than Bitpay can do is switch to mBTC and allow merchant to roundish 2 decimal after mBTC, because yeah the actual systeme of Bitpay with 4 decimals is not so good.

I'm fucking tired of all of you.
BITCOIN IS NOT BANNED FROM THAILAND. It's was a statement from the central bank, not LAW.
Proof :
 -  - 
There is one bar restaurant who accept bitcoin near where i live.
I never stop "trading" bitcoin, never got any issue.
And to finish : Illegal mean nothing in 3rd world especially in Thailand, where prostitution and counterfeil product are against law and can be find everywhere. :-o
Anyway OP if you come to Pattaya drop me a line, we can meet each other and have a drink at the restaurant who accept bitcoin :D (never tried yet)

when wall street will come in the game, it will not be 100$ rising. You will feel it trust me..
I think is mostly people from the last bubble rebuy, because bad news are over, and the bottom has been tested. 
The bottom make bitcoin really strong, because news was horrible with mtgox, still at 400$++ it's a miracle. Their is a lot of believer like me who will never sell. And we will become more and more, only fool, daily trader or miner will sell.
Btc will be rare. Who sold gold for fiat in war time ? :D We are in war.

And i'm not a pro in security huh. Just try to understand how from your gmail account him can take your bitcoin ? Do you use the same password ? Do you use only one wallet (spending/save) ?

Car explaination is the worst. Because is not that's useful in this world, right now.
Smart property will be possible only when this system is mature enough.
Share of company is a better way to talk about CC, because the best thing with colored coin is you can split a value of anything and sell it to multiple people.
Of course colored coin is useless without any trading place, and like everything else, you need trust on the web... But guess what ? Human are not stupid and created a rating system. E-Reputation. 
Rating will be usefull to marketplace where you can trade your CC, for the issuer of the coin it's like crowfunding after that... there is 90% of serious guy, 10% scammer. That's fine, like IRL i would say.
Maybe there is a possibility with coloredcoin to go with Multisign wallet for the issuer of the coin, if there is 5 people with a good reputation of the web selling share from the same company with a multisign, i think you will not need anymore proof of trust.
I'm not expert maybe we can go further : We can imagine a system where a shareholder can obtain a key of the multisign wallet after obtain  X% of the share ? How amazing it's can be for the trust.
For me Coloredcoin is like Bitcoin, it can be good only if some smart guy try to make something usefull with, a nice trading place is clairly the first step. 
The technology alone is useless, let's it some time before judge it.

like tomtomtom7 said 0 confirmation is enough for most of what you can buy.
more than 5 confirmations is the equal with credit card at 6 month (reverse chargeback transaction). For the merchant is way more secure to receive bitcoin than any card in the world.

Of course I was talking about like NOW. If OB take over the world lol, or become as big as ebay, advertising will be probably important, but for the moment, I don't think we will be thousands merchant selling the same item. Quality, customer service, price and the rating will be the advertising.
That's why I'm asking the BTC community to take it seriously and try OB now and to buy whatever they possibly need on OB instead of regular e-commerce websites for the release... Not to make me rich ;-) but to make it at least profitable, more merchants will come, and the competition between merchant will begin.
I plan to be a merchant but of course I will do the same, I will try to buy on OB.

Exactly SegWit can come after 4MB, it will certainly help and fix bug.
Scaling solution seem to come from Lighthing but nobody is sure with that, so 4MB isn't a bad option at the moment.
If there is enough traction. And if it only need all segwit switch to 4Mb to be sucessful I think we strongly should do that.

Not really, at the best bitcoin is a global financial instrument. China is very important country in our world. We can't do without China :) So is not only about the price.
I think if China miss the train, such as facebook they will make their own crypto currency ? So the world will be split ? I cannot imagine China get back to bitcoin if chinese dont have wealth in it, US advantage will be so huge in this case, they will need to make their own crypto currency i mean not the government itself, but they will "not ban" one of the cryptocurrency they choose to make their own.
I guess it's could happen, anyway exchange cryptocurrency is pretty easy, but yeah this country is an entiere world itself, they kind of already split the web in 2.
So in fact if you think their is no doubt if this technologie will suceed or not there is two choose :
1) one world with only 1 global crypto currency.
2) one world with many crypto currency.
Crypto currency DONT NEED to be global, but the world will not be the same if it's the case.

SegWit is the best way to go because it's less risked than simply upgrade to 4MB, was not this the whole point? Ok it fix issues too, which can be fixed later on 4MB. No?
So now 4MB is gaining traction I wonder why we have to do a drama? If big miners from China want to switch to 4MB I don't think it's a bad news. 
SegWit supporter, should follow the trend if there is any, and accept the fork. NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. SegWit supporter should not block and resist to this hardfork IMO, CoreDev, Company, and the community should be behind. Come on 4MB will not centralize anything or I'm missing something?
Even if we are going to 4MB, SegWit isn't dead. If Bitcoin continue his success and it will if a sucessful hard fork happen, SegWit will be on the table again. Because I don't think 4MB will solve anything. The same about Lightning.
I think we are making a big mistake standing against 4MB if this is where big miners want to go, we should not be sectarian. If I remember well SegWit was created to not technically go to 4mb directly, because chineese was against this due to orphan block with bad connection no?

Depends. 
If bitcoin is used as a store of value instead of USD or gold, and if it start to be mainstream to do this. it can very well be the end of a system.
It's not gonna be tomorrow and yes bitcoin will face legislation for sure... 
Like i say all the time in first we need bitcoin to bypass banking system and Western union in international medium of exchange first, this is the first step. 
Before that bitcoin can't pretend nothing in this serious business :D and will stay an underground medium of exhange and store of value, which is fine too.

Anyway i'm not saying i'm 100% sure the winter is coming, i'm able to keep some fiat and invest in others things but the risk/reward of bitcoin is huge in my opinion.
You did not explain what Inflation-protected savings  but if you are talking about real estate or stock market for me in the exact opposite, a low risk/reward, you are able to protect yourself against inflation it's true, but you expose yourself to lose a lot for this protection. 
Anyway investment is investment there is risk / reward, you should explain more what investment you think are correct, but for me everything who are affiliate with fiat are high risk.

Multiple factor, for now we have the problem about blocksize debat, no body really care about what will happen in 1 year, but people care about what happens in NY and in the blocksize or whatever. It's normal.
Everybody knows it's coming, but miner still sell the large majority of what they mine to cover their expanse.
When their will be 3 threads on this subreddit of halving everyday it will be a thing. Halving it's a huge event, but it's still one year far.
6-3-1 months before People will start to hold a bit more, miner too.   The price will start to going up, we all know what happen in this case "to the moon" thread, some media cover "soon bitcoin it will have x2 less bitcoin on the market!" and we are in the next bubble, but a strong one i believe, because their is a fact. Every fucking 10minutes it will have 12.5 bitcoin less available on the market.

Depends for who... and from where, i bought at 120$ the major party of bitcoin i own (not too much).
Yeah i was happy at 1200... Some of my friend bought at 4$...
I believe you are american it's cool for you, dollars is pretty stable, what about Argentina or Venezuela ?
Do you believe the currency you own whatever it is, will stay stable forever ?
I'm not saying everyone should use bitcoin now as a store of value (that's why i said before be a real store of value, bitcoin need to be an almost free an instant international medium of exchange it's the first step), just in a near future i could be one way to escape to a currency crisis which is likely to happen soon. no?
Everyone should at least understand how bitcoin works, and setup an exchange account,

And i'm now sure bitcoin will take over a lot of thing. And that's one reason why (and not the only one, failure of actual fiat and stock market it's another) it will rise in value, and at the end (5-10years), will become a strong store of value.
But again time will tell, you think i have zero experience with finance, but me i think you have 0 awareness of what the world is, and why bitcoin can help NOW worker and saver in many countries around the world (venezuela, argentina) , and soon it will be useful for USA one day maybe too. So don't be so sure about what you are saying.

i will watch the vod when i have some free time, but i just would like to say, you have to read The sovereign individual (  )

in my research i fund this post on the new reddit 
ethernet 0 points (+0|-0) 5 months ago 
(you should upvote him for this nice post lol 0 point poor guy)
"I've spent days trying to figure out who Satoshi Nakamoto is and i don't think he is a shady Japanese guy. If you wanna look at who invented bitcoin you need to look back to early 90s and cypherpunks (not to be confused with cyberpunks) and the extropians. People like Nick Szabo, Adam Back, Hal Finny, David Chaum etc
You should read the cypherpunk menefesto (google it, easy to find) They have been trying to make bitcoin for like 20 years! Satoshi is just a fake name they picked for the person who would reveal it to the world! If you're going up against the banks, would you want your name out there?! HELL FUCKING NO. they are very smart people!
Here.. wanna have some fun with this? Wanna go down the rabbit hole? Let me help you with some fuuuuun research.
Let's start with some history:
“RPOW” was added on top of Adam Back’s “HashCash”. (This is how Hal Finney created the solution for the Byzantine General’s Problem which allowed BitGold/Bitcoin to be completed). 
It seems BitCoin was then mostly created in the comment sections of the "Nanobarter", "BitGold" &amp; "BitGold-Markets" papers(look at "url's" for correct dates).    
2007 Szabo applies BitGold and his "Scarce Object" theory to Zookos p2p hard drive project.
Szabo: "One possible answer to central mint vulnerability is bit gold -- a currency the value of which does not depend on any particular trusted third party. ANOTHER alternative is (an object barter economy"Scarce Objects")." Note: Put these all together and you have Bitcoin.... 
Note: The relation between Zooko and Jim McCoy needs to be understood.....Zooko is just using Jim's earlier work to create a new system using parts of MojoNation. Understand that Jim McCoy is the real "Drive" behind the creation of these type of schemes. McCoy has spent most of his life and millions of his own dollars in trying to find the best scheme for his MojoNation ideas.(That's right, he's ritch.)
Szabo quote: "I'm sure you and Jim can make better guesses than I in this regard, and I'd love to hear them, but I can suggest a general approach. My approach would be to start with some possible proxy measures of what users find valuable in backup services: gigabytes, reliability, timeliness, etc. Choice(s) of proxy measure are worth quite a bit of brainstorming and experimentation because the best proxy measures may be highly non-obvious."
Szabo and Jim McCoy relation: 
Jim McCoy quoye:
"I'd be quite interested in more detail about what you tried to implement and how it compares to what I have proposed....At some point we should sync up over vast quantities of alcohol and I can describe various approaches that were proposed, implemented, or abandoned."
Nick Szabo quote: "Jim, I do appreciate your comments, and I'd love to learn more over beer (but not until August -- bar exam :-)."
"I have extensively studied barter and money systems (in addition to working for David Chaum and playing a major role setting up a certificate authority) and do believe I have some insights."
Quotes from Cryddit (aka Ray Dillinger "Bear" original cypherpunk-mentored by Tim C. May himself)
"Speaking as someone who reviewed some of his code in late 2008, I think I can express a pretty strong opinion that it was probably written by one person."
"As for comments, he rarely used one word where none would do. His comments were mostly limited to notes to himself to do stuff later or resolve design issues, not explanations. In itself, not unusual, but again, you wouldn't find it completely consistent across a project by multiple people."
"I should clarify this last. What I mean is that people who are coding as part of a team usually use comments to explain the code they're writing to the other members of the team. So-called "lone wolf" programmers making something all by themselves usually are in the habit of not needing to explain anything to anyone so they don't."
Satoshi states early in the mailing list that he did it backwards, writing code first then writing the white paper:
"I appreciate your questions. I actually did this kind of backwards. I had to write all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve every problem, then I wrote the paper. I think I will be able to release the code sooner than I could write a detailed spec. You're already right about most of your assumptions where you filled in the blanks." ~ Satoshi Nakamoto 
Someone else who had this habbit to code first with no white paper and very little notes:
Jim McCoy quote: "A lot of our various ideas and implementation changes were either lost when whiteboards were re-tasked (at one point we were actually using polaroid snapshots of whiteboards to maintain internal history Smiley or never explained even in the code........no one really had the inclination to write up white papers or discuss design decisions in email, so we ended up leaving less of a digital trail than anyone would have liked."

Okok but what you say at this end is largely paranoid, everything is possible in hacking, but very unlikely to happen. Hardwallet is enough for most of us.
If you comit to a big transaction like 10 or 20btc maybe you should read the entiere adress, on both screen.

I've got a friend who's working for Uber as a engineer. They dont want to incorpore bitcoin for now, the market is too low. They already have a ton of work, and they are focus on expending, they don't have enough engineer now for the grow, so not for this tiny market which is bitcoin.
And they don't want any more problem with legal issue, since they have a LOT of trouble, they prefere to stay classic for now, you already have a lot of state and country against you, they don't want to add more problem with visa or MC :D
It's what he told me... 
I believe they will be force to accept bitcoin if its start to be huge, and if they finish their expansion, to optimise fee processing transaction, maybe in 2-5 years ? :P

Again you don't get what openbazaar is. 
It's an opensource project, not just a website.
You can take the code and make your apple friendly website tomorrow if you want to.
Nobody on openbazaar pretend your mam will be able to buy sextoy from day one, it's not the point.
I believe your friend like mine was unable to download anything and you had to do it for them on emule or napster, and fucking burn a cd T_T just for 12 fucking music, now they all know how to do. Even sometime they know tell me where are the best torrent website (and they know nothing about internet more than FACEBOOK and DOWNLOAD) What it's important for now it's the technology not the accessibility from day one.
We all gonna be (who will be able to use openbazaar from dayone) kind of betatester for few months/years i believe.

cool for you, i had almost the same story few months ago, maybe 20 Btc in a wallet double encryption. No seed of course :D
I could remember the 1st password without problem, but the 2nd one... LoL... it took me 2 stressful hours. The feeling is hard when you type 3 or 4 wrong password.
No kidding human brain is shit, we are all paranoid so we want to use longer, different password than we use normaly. At the end the brain start to be fucked up, too many password to remember, because i had 1 saving wallet, 1 spending wallet with 2 pass each. 
The saving wallet was not use for maybe 1year and half.
Anyway all of this to suggest you to stop this and use hardwallet. This changed my bitcoin experience, so good to have it.

It would be better to maybe focus at first in something very pollutant and/or valuable at first, and expand the concept later. 
I'm naturaly thinking about all sort of battery, old cell phone  ...
I think Phone can be identified with imei or something like that ? Not sure.
There is another Great idea, but who is very different and maybe more simple, you can make a penny converter. I mean we all have a huge amount of penny, or coin, and sometime i'm lazy to take this on me for spend it. Usually i have bottle of plastic full of this and i don't know what to do with.
One time in Canada Montreal i saw a small machine in a supermarket which allow you to convert penny vs a voucher. Of course the machine was taking a large cut, something like 10% or 15% i forgot, and you can spend it only in this supermarket. 
I don't know i have the feeling like if the machine work and start to be expand everywhere it can be nice for bitcoin and for people.
Penny vs Bitcoin. I like this idea. :D
Of course this is only the first step for micro payment automatic machine vs something. You can do what you suggest later on. Start small, see big :D

Honestly I was about to buy some gold... Because I have "enough" bitcoin (% of my wealth) but seriously when you start to really want buy gold it's a nightmare, you have to be sure to not buy a copy, you have to know where to store it against thief or humidity, you have to give your ID.
It's when you realize bitcoin is superior. Remember me the first time I was about to buy Bitcoin, needed a wire to Mtgox, my bank refused, it's when I've understand Bitcoin is superior :D
But I will still buy gold something around 10%/20% of my wealth and pay a company to store it securely any advice btw? :)

bitcoin is still the currency who protect the blockchain. No bitcoin no blockchain.
If the blockchain become more and more usefull then the bitcoin become more valuable, because you have to maintain the price of bitcoin high enough to pay the miner.

Thanks for this post, this is actually one of the main point why I don't think ETH is superior to BTC.
ETH has "official" devs and this is their project, if ETH became a threat to anything, they will setup them. 
It's like the difference between Torrents and Piratebay. Bitcoin is a technology own by no one, piratebay was a company. Not sure if it's an appropriate analogy. But the idea is there :P
However I like ETH, I've missed the opportunity to invest early, it was probably a mistake. And ultimately ETH is good for Bitcoin, competitions always are, because yes they are competitor at the end.

Really I'm really tired about your debate. Whatever the solution is, I will take it at this point. This summer could be the start of the end for Bitcoin. It's not like it will be something horrible for the crypto world. But probably the end of the PoW only consensus, and anarchism style. Bitcoin is showing one thing to me: When something become too valuable without any proper form of gouvernance it's just a mess.
The future of crypto currencies might be corporate/centralized. Which is an horrible idea to me. Really you have to put all your effort at least to avoid this, it's not about the value of Bitcoin (I can switch them to whatever I like in a few seconds), it's about an idea.
This is not againt you, but about the whole community. Core devs and miners in particularly.

sorry but 2mb was in the roadmap no? Segwit alone is not enough to handle everything, 2mb + segwit I guess yes. Then we can go on lighthing and decide if future increase of block is necessary. I don't think it will, but 2mb is also a progress IMO. The community is tired of this fight, devs I just ask you to make it work please. :)

We like or we don't like Crypt0 videos, but Omar is more than legit on this community, a true believer and evangelist. Always measured about Cryptos. He is educating people.
I think CoinDesk is becoming too professional which is good, but they should keep the interest of cryptos in first, and act like we are a community not everything is about money or business.
Omar did a great job covering this event, I will say it clearly: If there is no excuse from CoinDesk I will boycott them. This is not acceptable.

its been a while than betting on e-sport exist in korea. A scandal happened with starcraft with a lot of consequences : 
A lot of player was involved and was banned from the community.
Anyway this website is a nice idea, this website will maybe allow you to bet in your own match against a friend ? Did you ever bet anything on something with friend ? so you will be able to do so online with a online friend, for a virtual game.
For more competitive player, i can imagine one famous player from a game, try it and, guess what ? yes for me as a starcraft player i can bet and lose 0.5btc with a smile on my face if i can play a famous top player.
Last point, for player who want to play unknow player and still bet on it, it's possible, what the problem, i will not be afraid to play 5 or 10$ by game. I'm average good player, maybe i will be able to have a ratio of 50%. There is a lot of player like me, not so good to win all the match, but not so bad to lose all of them. This will just make my game more intense.
Anyway good luck for this website, i don't know why people are talking about "bet" and stuff like that, it's not like this guy said him want to be the next Pokerstars.com, it's will be not, and??? Still, some gamer will have interest in it for many reasons and some as i said before in this post.

I think people start to be a lot more interested by bitcoin, but it's not like it's a (r)evolution easy to understand. People who start to researching some information only a few % of them will get in. And it's gonna take months
the democratisation of bitcoin will uprise when some serious company will adopt bitcoin officialy. And when an easy way to buy / secure bitcoin will be available (hardwallet or kill apps smartphone). However i fully trust start-up who works on hardware and the core of early adopters who works on idea... a damn smart community...
And very Frankly bitcoin is still a big bet =), noone already knows what will happen with governments in few months. But it's worth, i believe in the technology, but not in lobby and men of power. That's why we are not already in 10k$, we take the risk before the mainstream? :)
So no bitcoin is not bigger than we think, but this is the proof it will become huge in few time if everything goes like we all wish

There is always a down, yeah. But a crash... ? Not so sure.
Is not like there will be ANYWAY a crash... Last time the crash was about a massive hack problem. Not because the price was rising crazy. Did you remember that ?...
The 2 (+1) more obv fact for me of this rising are just standard, and there is no reason for a "crash" just a correction will happens after the high (who know where its will be...) :
+ 1 China, the number of bitconer just rising. Standard i would say no?... Bitcoin market is still small. Baidu is coming into : Virtually 1.3 billions of people heard something about it somewhere. Can you imagine the impact of it, on a market like this ? (+ the fact of westerner understand china is committing more, so they try to buy before the high - before it's possibly too late - )
+ 2 Difficulty of mining insanely increased. And it's will continue, people like me not pro at all in mining, who not care so much about this part of bitcoin aspect, just understanding this : There will be less and less "new BTC" create by day. And it's start right now. 
Mining Stuff bought thousand of dollars couple months ago who was working so well to mine (SO MANY) bitcoin, and supply demand very well (who was lower as now), start to become ALREADY obsolete.
Time to buy maybe before the next insane difficulty (who is coming very soon)
+ 3 fact who is just a standard of this kind of rising no need to be say but i would anyway : Price are rising, Media are talking about this, New person are coming into market + People who hold bitcoin but not really pay attention last couple of month are coming back to check what's happening.
Snowball effect.
But i don't really understand why people are talking about crash. 
Crash can happens but not because price are rising fast!...
Correct me if i'm wrong :D

Be careful with the money you invest in, is a good advice.
I hope we are still the early adopter (and i'm pretty sure about this), but instead of store it, you should try to talk about this, and use it, is the best way to go on the moon. Not just wait and post some dumb thing on reddit when the price up.
@_date: 2013-10-27 12:27:59
Thanks, we can assume it's lower than this!
Confort me in the way we are just crazy geek - or still fucking early adopters.
Keep spread about bitcoin, send few dollars to a friend. Tips people outside when they deserve it....! Share innovation on facebook, and more !
if we are something like 0.1% tomorrow we will be 0.2% and after tomorrow 0.4%. When we reach 1% we are already at xxxx$ or very near, and governement will take it seriously. Embrace or Condamn. The show must go on. :D :D :D after go to piracy money around 50$ (and some ballerz will start the resistance) or embrace money xxk$! (and all of us will have a big smile on face "I TOLD YA!!!!!!")
So talk about bitcoin in is very cool. But talk about this outside it's all what we have to do.

not agree.
with uBTC, bitcoin just look like monkey or monopoly money.
With mBTC we can have a kind of parity with currency like euro or usd, for a while, even if we reach 5k$, 1mBTC will still be 5$ which is perfect.
If you want a currency who look strong and serious, you need to be over traditionnal fiat in value to be psychologically stronger for people. Bitcoin need to stay precious in minds of people...

BITCOIN IS NOT ILLEGAL IN THAI AND IN FRANCE.
You all made a mistake about thailand. There is no law about bitcoin. The story is a guy who run the first exchange in thailand "ask" to the central thai bank (something like this) if him can do this kind of business they said "no" and him stop his business.
Is not illegal in thailand, there is many seller in localbitcoin.
and there is website where you can buy, pay your bill electricty, and topup your phone...
For finish, bitcoin is not so usefull in thailand, only for international. For national transfert, is very easy to do so, it's free  h24 7/7 to an random atm you can send anykind of transfert (personnal, commercial etc..) to someone simply in atm in 20secondes. You can topup your phone aswell, bank are very convenient in thailand, way more than in France or even a national wire transfert is a fucking pain in the ass.

yep i think the best way to do it is to have a double display... mBTC + BTC At least for a year.
We need wallet and exchange switch to mBTC + BTC double display first. People will not talk about mBTC naturally it's have to be push by main plateforme!
But is not very urgent, we need to stabilize at 1000$++ for few weeks / months first i think...
But yeah when it's done we have to REALLY make it happens.

i think 51% attack will not work at all. Because it will be a huge spotlight on bitcoin and crypto currency for sure, yes thousands of people will lose money.
But we have many other crypto currency, and we will surely switch to another one such as litecoin. Or another one, and we gonna protect it vs 51% attack, and maybe make it more private (bitcoin is not anonym at all)
So yeah it's a big deal for bitcoin, but for the technology, not so much. Bitcoin is still a bet for that, because nobody knows what will be government reaction.
But for china, if TV and website are able to talk about this, and support it, its because China government is ok with. So let's think about something hypothetical : Imagine china have interest to have a global currency such as bitcoin, to try to stop the supremacy of USD.
And the usa want to destroy bitcoin, can we think there is a way to spy the minage thing to be able to detect a incoming 51% attack and repond to make it fail the answer is yes.
I think we are possibly on this kinds of cyberwar. Since bitcoin is a major technology who can change the global politic. I think major agency of each country was working on it way before 2013...
And i sometime as a paranoiak Bitcoin is not so hated by government, because transaction are not private, and exchange asking a proof of ID. I think NSA is already working on it, and have a huge data about this, so easy for them to hack mtgox... If you have 25% of the identity wallet, do you think bitcoin will ever be something private ? Come on. It's a dream for agency like this. Just collect all the metadata and wait to have a tool to expoit it.

Thx, that's why i should maybe care more about mining thing. I will. ;D

anonymity for them, and no anonymity for most of people (who buying in exchange with proof of id and adress)

not agree.
with uBTC, bitcoin just look like monkey or monopoly money.
With mBTC we can have a kind of parity with currency like euro or usd, for a while, even if we reach 5k$, 1mBTC will still be 5$ which is perfect.
If you want a currency who look strong and serious, you need to be over traditionnal fiat in value to be psychologically stronger for people.  Bitcoin need to stay precious in minds of people...
uBTC is the worst upvote topic for long time by far. What do you want guys ? look like you are rich "yeahhhhhh i have so much figure on my wallet!!":D

I'm new on reddit, and really tips over internet is fucking awesome to me who is an active forum user since i'm 12 yo... (27 now...). A part of internet history i feel.
But i still not understand how to fund the "wallet tips" with the original bot, and how it's work EXACTLY (because i never used it). So maybe it's cool if extension can help to make it more user friendly, and of course make it happens over internet, and not only to reddit.
It's a VERY good way to spread bitcon also ! 
So pretty happy about that, and this kind of thing remind me i forgot to try to understand and make my time tips, i will do so tomorrow, then try the chrome extension.
Cool stuff.

Today we had economic expert in french business channel tv, talking about bitcoin, and the fluctuation was like the main problem for the economic expert
"HOW CAN YOU ACCEPT BITCOIN AS A MERCHANT WHEN YOU SEE THIS KIND OF FLUCTUATION?"
Oh my god... ;-)

Yep i think you right, 1 million coin it's just too much.
This is not communism, but we can assume the creator of this technology can be highly reward, but own about 10% of a global curency it's like crazy, and not good for the confidence in it aswell.
Because we don't even know who or what is satoshi. Who can be 100% sure satoshi is not a dark project ? Who can be sure 100% this technology will drive world to more liberty ? Not me. 
Global currency is at the same time a beautiful idea, but also a dangerous one.
In fact i just hope this coin are just lost. But i don't think so... :)

Why everyone are just happy when it's go up quickly like this. Me i'm like "fuckkkkkk my 10next bitcoin will cost me 1900$ instead of 1400$!"
I'm the only one who think like this ?
Or most of the people here have already a huge amount of bitcoin ? 
Me i believe in the fact where its bitcoin will reach xx,xxx$ but i want it not too fast, give me time to buy it at the best price... Below 150$ It's ok for me, 120$ i will be very happy.
Calm down chinese please... ;-)

Me i'm looking for a wallet who is easy to put money in, and more hard to make a transaction out.
Like this i can use it like for store my bitcoin.
The double authentification is nice, why not add a SMS confirmation required with a small pin for anymoney go out. You can charge it no problem. I'm talking about a wallet where normally there will be no transaction out at all, only for emergency. "save wallet".
Maybe is still useless and will not really enforce the security. But for me, i like to go on my wallet sometime just see my balance (i know it's dumb :D), and i have to put ALL details : Identification, password + email confirmation code. And after this i can do everything i want. Feel not normal for me. I'm always thinking like "oh maybe i just got a keylogger yesterday with this pornwebsite, better for me if i don't go look my balance wallet today"
There is anyway to add a security level for out transaction ?
Thanks if someone know if this kind of wallet exist, and if not if my idea will inforce the security? I feel like yes, maybe a short 6number pin with "3 try" is LARGELY enough.

any way to buy or not buy :D this book in pdf ? 
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:19:34
yep very important to switch to mBTC... At least when we reach 4 figures 
No body want to buy a fraction of something, and its kind of ridiculous to pay like 0.005 for a beer :P
