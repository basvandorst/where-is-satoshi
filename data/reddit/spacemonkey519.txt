so this is just a drop in the bucket compared to what is actually going on, interesting. Forgot to consider how huge China really is!

interesting, so should the controls be applied to the interior this would change significantly. I guess the real question is how does the chinese gov really feel about bitcoin and what can we expect for future regulation

If the government is cracking down on capital flight how is this huge amount of money still making it to the exchange? Did some googling and could only find really general info about the chinese btc scene, could someone explain this? Does the chinese gov actually like bitcoin or is there something else going on?

really makes you think about bitcoins potential! ive been pretty disillusioned with it, been out since the whole block size debate really started(was that ever resolved, or did we just stop talking about it?), but now I am thinking I will buy the next dip, if cavirtex will stop screwing up direct deposits.....

wow that article makes me miss the 90s, "So how come my local mall does more business in an afternoon than the entire Internet handles in a month? Even if there were a trustworthy way to send money over the Internet—which there isn't—the network is missing a most essential ingredient of capitalism: salespeople."

someone else answered all my questions:
" its architecture will have to be altered again and again..."
It's been 6 years, and has held up to $10billion of liquidity without modifying architecture yet. This happens once every 10 years maybe and mostly only because encryption continues to mature.
"What happens if a change makes old bitcoins incompatible with new coins"
When there is an actual fork in the bitcoin code, each version has it's own chain. The consensus is global and between many parties including miners, wallets, users and others. Either everyone upgrades, or no one does. In any case, you never have to worry about duplicate coins being spent or created as the world is only on one bitcoin blockchain at a time.
"Never mind the fact that jp morgan or goldman sachs could manipulate the shit out of the bitcoin market..."
This is only true up until a point, as bitcoin continues to grow in both usability/utility and liquidity, there will come a time when it's marketcap will be large enough that no one entity could ever move the price single handedly.

I was wondering why I couldnt login! This has never happened to protonmail before has it?

I've made around 9000 off bitcoin over the past few years, I'm definitely not a noob, and the internet is still pretty broken and may need to drastically change as well, nothing is safe out there.

wow thats really interesting! starting coding man the world needs that
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:12:29

rumple, I would diversify more if I could but I should mention that was all the money I have, im just a university student. My goal is simply to grow my savings, and im ok with the risk.

hmm sounds like the biggest obstacle to this is that miners would essentially control the vote (from choosing whether or not to share blockchains they have mined) So it is still a possibility but the bitcoin software would changed alot to prevent this.

Just wanted to add, I still do have 3 BTC, anyone else have a bad feeling that another serious forking issue is down the road (like when bitcoin went from 0.7 to 0.8?)
