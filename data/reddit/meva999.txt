I want to think he's being very sarcastic but not 100% sure :) . Every market has its run(s) up to higher levels and followed up with a correction at some point. Stop calling it a "crash". Everything in crypto happens much faster vs regular markets with higher volatility. These "crashes" are normal corrections that every market has. They usually follow measurable Fibonacci retracement levels closely. Draw yourself some pretty trend lines from the "Crash" to "Crash" bottoms and you'll see a parabolic curve patter starting to appear. Just know what you're talking about before claiming the sky is falling... Waiting until after a correction before buying into any market is always good advice. Just stop using the word crash.

You could use a random dictionary. It could be English, English to Spanish, another language... Doesn't matter... Just make sure you can get another one easily in the future. Find your word and record the page number (eg. 52) then count down the page to your word (eg. 19). Combining the two together to look like this (52-19). In some cases, the seed word ends with a consonant like "ing" which may not be in your dictionary. In this case, I would add it to the end like this (52-19.ing). You could store these any which way you like so long as no one knows which book it came from. Might be best to get it from a local bookstore vs Amazon in case your computer is compromised in some way. Storing these random numbers online instead of the actual seed words would be my preference. Of course, I would also encrypt them just for an added dose of BACK OFF GET YOUR OWN CRYPTO!

What a huge milestone for BTC :)
Participating / watching since 2012 and it still feels like BTC is just getting started. "Exciting" feels like an oversimplification. Can't wait to see what 2018 brings because so far 2017 has me grinning from ear to ear!

I'm from Canada so not quite... but they sneeze and we cough for some reason so I bet we'll help pay for it in some way... me thinks they'll have enough to worry about rebuilding the damage in Texas and Florida.

Thanks for sharing! Enjoyed the story :)

As a Canadian I don't get to vote on American problems so it doesn't matter what I think. I agree healthcare is a major problem though.
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:41:12
No kidding... I'll keep my original BTC and sell everything else for more original BTC... If not BTC then I'll use it to keep building my ETH portfolio. Would be nice to get to 31 ETH for staking when the time comes :D

Don't know much about universal health care... Healthcare is almost free up here in the north. I agree healthcare is a huge problem in the states though.
