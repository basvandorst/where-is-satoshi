THE LAW ENDS WHERE MY STUPID LIFE CHOICES BEGIN
Lel get burned kid. How the hell did you buy in at $260 not knowing the things are only worth $15? This is what you deserve for using reddit

LMAO at all these pathetic idiots who can't admit they lost hard. "Well according to current trends it..." According to trends it's a FUCKING BUBBLE. The only use for bitcoins is buying drugs, CP and getting arrested over fake assassinations. Are all of you holding onto them going to tell everyone you know to invest in narcotic child porn money?
The standard price of bitcoins is between $10 and $30. It's not going to rise above fifty for months and months. At this point the people who actually sell things for bitcoins aren't accepting them. If they drop low again and all of you autists buy frantically and fluxuate the market again guess what will happen? NO ONE will accept them as payment and any backing they had is now gone.
Keep the aire of smuggness though. Ride it right into that noose.

LETS KEEP THE PRICE FLUCTUATING WILDLY! SOON WE'LL ENSURE THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY ACCEPTED THESE FOR GOODS NEVER OPEN UP TO TAKE THEM AGAIN! TOGETHER WE CAN DESTROY THIS CURRENCY AND BECOME BROKE, WHILE WE BREAK SILK ROADS DRUG TRADE.
YAAAAAAAY REDDIT

The only thing you can do if you bought in over $200 (LOL) is wait for the silk road dealers to open up and buy your drug of choice to console yourself for falling for a bubble and not knowing the past of the market very well. These things aren't even worth $50. A small number of closely related accounts bought a huge number of bitcoins and traded them back and forth untim people jumped in and this happened. I'm honestly surprised it didn't start this process at $190 when it started to fall. I think it only recovered because of naive people thinking at $170 "THIS IS MY CHANCE!". 
Anyway yeah. If you don't want to buy drugs with them you can hire someone to kill you, or sit on them for years. This won't happen again soon.

You can't buy them cheap until they are worth less than what heroin dealers and kiddie porn peddlars think they are worth. This would be under $10 at the most expensive to be considered "cheap"
You don't know shit about bitcoins and all of this retarded speculation is going to get them locked out as a viable trading currency.

May I ask why anyone thinks this isn't a free fall? Are you guys going to spread the word that people should buy untraceable money for drug deals, assassinations and CP on the herp web? From what I hear silk road dealers and the like aren't even accepting the coins currently because of the volatility of the situation. Their true value before all of this market manipulation BS was never more than $10-30. If you really think it's going to stay this high as the Russian mafia dump all the coins the laundered and the only people who originally drive the market keep their shops closed; you are delusional.
