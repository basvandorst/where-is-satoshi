I'm vegan, and I like to brew my own beer. 
So, I'm just trying to lead by example, the same way I am with bitcoin. :)

Is gold a currency?
Both gold &amp; BTC are mined, not created.

Well, I'm using cgminer via the Terminal, and it's been running non-stop since November...
Haven't tried mining with any of the gui packages (Asteriod, etc.)...

Guilty as charged: I'm vegan &amp; a BTC miner. 
It is good that you are *mindful* of your actions, and not simply doing what everyone else is because we were raised that way.

As someone who started mining last fall, if I had bought bitcoin at $1000/BTC instead of investing in ASICS, I would have double the BTC I have mined, and that does not count the energy costs.
Roll the dice, friend.

Crack it open, add a USB interface &amp; cram a block erupter in there to do the SHA256.

Maybe you included alternate characters in your mnemonic? 
Like, instead of "Apple Horse Water Copper", maybe you replaced some characters, like "App1e H0rse Wat3r C0pp3r"?

Example: you create a wallet in MultiBit, and bitcoin are sent to  your new address. You pay using this address, and the change is then put into a new address that MultiBit creates.

I mine on a couple of Macs using Asics (block erupters, BFL Jalapeno) with no problems...
I downloaded this installer

Solo, pooled, whatever. I'll worry about whether I want 2 BTC a week from a pool vs 25 BTC once or twice a year after I find out if this setup will work at all. 
But I was considering beginning with a pool.

Like notagardner, I only have a small amount  (0.0250003 BTC) in my first wallet. There may be minimum amounts needed for some transactions, and of course transaction fees must be considered. 
If there will only be 21 million coins mined by 2013, and there are 7 billion people on the planet... well, let's just say that I wouldn't be surprised if BTC shoots up to $5,000-$10,000 in the next ten years or so as adoption increases. 
I wonder if even a modest amount could be used to purchase ASICMiner shares which could automatically keep building your balance for you. That's what I'm currently considering; I just need to research the minimum purchase amounts. You might find this thread interesting:

    Well, let's see here...
    Below is a comparision between 4.5 &amp; 7GH/s based on calculations from this site:
	Coins	Dollars
per Day	฿0.15	$15.86
per Week	฿1.02	$111.05
per Month	฿4.41	$482.29
	Coins	Dollars
per Day	฿0.23	$24.68
per Week	฿1.58	$172.75
per Month	฿6.86	$750.23
    Granted, difficulty and exchange rate will vary, but at least this gives you a comparison.

You want to reset the printing system:
you may also be interested in deleting ALL cache files via a safe boot (hold down option key on boot until you see the apple logo, wait for progress bar to finish, at safeboot login screen reboot again).

Ah, that makes sense; pooled mining it is on this machine. Thanks for clearing that up.
Although Easyminer ships with the Jalapeno, Josh sez: "We recommend BFGMiner or CGMiner on Linux.":
So it looks like I'll use one of these.
