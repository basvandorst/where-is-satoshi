I mean of course. Otherwise what would be the incentive for a company to provide cloud mining? The mining is done via automation so you are just buying access to means of production. A company would only sell that access if they made more money selling access than they would owning the production themselves. 
It is a "too good to be true" scenario.

That isn't the same as financing terrorism wtf

It won't happen because we have to leave the centralization to the "experts" or else the economy would crash

Obama was a literal puppet. I mean look at him. You put your fist up there and use his mouth to talk with your hands.
@_date: 2016-11-11 23:40:34
Obama didn't follow through on a lot of things he promised...

Inflation is the hidden tax on our future after all. The bubble has to burst at some point, and the established powers have been protecting this bubble for generations. They are sitting on a house of cards, and the cards can only stack up so high before the forces of nature topple them down. Can't wait to see what happens, millenials of developed nations around the world are finally becoming fed up with their politically-backed financial institutions and rightly so. Those very institutions are becoming increasingly seen as obsolete and therefore more self-serving with each passing day. Hopefully the change is within my lifetime because us followers of crypto already know the best method to store our value when the inevitable chaos arrives. More importantly we could be among the first to pave the way for the brightest economic situation possible for the world as a whole. No more value siphoned off and wasted thanks to ego-driven groupthink and primitive tribalisms. What a world that could be!

Savings is our future though. But yes I agree with your sentiments whole-heartedly. I believe the internet and freedom of information will be the catalyst for waking people up to the truth of how our system is run. The illuminati conspiracy theorists were onto something, now lets help them put the pieces together and start a revolution.

I never said it would be an easy or quick process. I think the natural order of supply and demand will eventually topple the system if it fails to properly address the issues of the middle class and below. Once the middle class is wiped out, which it will in my opinion thanks to greed clouding the judgement of the upper class, we will see people on a massive scale looking for answers. The anti-establishment narrative has already been started, just take a look at how Donal Trump got elected. Unfortunately he is far from the right answer, but it's the first real step I have seen in regards to the "waking up" process that I think is really happening. Once people realize simply voting won't change anything, people will lose trust in the system even further. It's all leading up to something. 
In regards to the bigger picture, Marx was right about the social result of our system. He was wrong about the result being a dead end revolution resulting in the welfare state. He had little faith in humanity and he greatly understimated our potential as a species. What he didn't understand is this revolution will be fought economically, with technology being our weapon to make that happen. Progress as a civilization requires it no matter how scary, uncertain, and impossible it seems right now. This change is simply human evolution doing what it does best- adapting for something better than what was previously known. The process is as painful as it is rewarding.

I think he is talking about investments that don't involve cryptocurrencies....

Or asking a unified trans-dimensional super consciousness what is the advantage of experiencing novelty and ignorance again, imploding itself into another big bang, reversing entropy and continuing the cycle of creation for all of eternity.
Wait what subreddit am I even in right now? I need to stop smoking so much weed...

More like an educated guess than a gamble. The guess being btc will become more popular and trendy than it was when you bought.

A pact only works if the more powerful party agrees to enforce it. The most powerful party gets their power through force, during a time of chaos, and everyone else has to play their game until the next opposition comes to challenge. This is war buffered by the game of economics. And it's their game, not yours. Until you come knocking on their door with the largest army the world has ever seen, stirring up the most chaos the world has ever seen, things will stay the same. And I think nobody wants a single force that powerful, for what would be put in place of what we have now could be much worse.
Just think of the society we have built up, for all the good and all the bad. It isn't perfect, but maintaining the delicate balance between order and chaos is a constant effort and an interest that all living things share.

It appreciates depending on a lot of things, mainly an actively growing economy and a good local market. You don't have those two and you are SOL.

Why offer 50 percent when they can keep all of it? I mean worth a shot but that is wishful thinking at best. Unless you can steal them back yourself, which it sounds like the thieves covered their tracks better than you did yours. Sorry to say but you most likely won't be seeing those coins again (unless it was an inside job as others have mentioned). Just learn from it and move on.

If they are mixing the coins thoroughly you are SOL. They are probably not tying it to one location with those sums. LE investigation will have trouble getting past that, as would anyone else. Improbable, people launder sub mil sums broken up through mixers frequently. Think of all the darknet drug dealers out there who still fly under the radar.

Don't forget to look into altcoins as well. Competetion is good!

Any user with sense would see cloud mining as a scam. If it is too good to be true, it is.
@_date: 2016-07-26 01:24:00
You think people would put down those quantities in btc? No way. Too risky. 
@_date: 2016-07-30 16:07:39
I agree completely! It is totally subjective. One of the biggest motivators for getting rich is to pass that wealth on to your children and family so that they can have a good life that you provided for them. One can see that as unfair because the rich kid got money for being born or one can see that as fair because the parent worked to provide a better standard of living than what he or she recieved growing up. It is all in *how* you look at things...

Plus fractional banking was already invented by this point. They had a notary system.
