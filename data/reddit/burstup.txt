In the 1990s, people said email won't scale, the usenet won't scale, the web will not scale, youtube will destroy the internet cause it can't scale, BitTorrent won't scale, etc. etc. - and they were right. Failing to scale is a good thing. New protocols were invented, better cables were put into the ground, better servers were built. The internet - failing to scale gracefully for the past 25 years. Bitcoin is failing to scale, too. It will take over the world.
@_date: 2016-08-10 08:29:36
I think you're too pessimistic there. It's cool that you gave away free BTC to people. I also do that sometimes. But what gives Bitcoin its value is not its adoption as a payment option. Not yet. Right now it's more important for people to save bitcoins. And to spread the word. Then we'll need applications. I am not worried about mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. It mirrors the adoption of email and the web. It might take another 10-20 years. But it will happen. Just keep a few BTC in a paper wallet and be patient.

Bear: An investor who believes that a particular market is headed downward and attempts to profit from a decline in prices.
Bear market: A condition in which prices fall and pessimism causes a market's downward spiral to be self-sustaining.
Bull: An investor who thinks the market is poised to rise and purchases an asset under the assumption that he can sell it at a higher price later.
Bull market: A condition in which prices are rising or are expected to rise. 
Fork: In software engineering, a fork happens when developers take a copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software. The term often implies not merely a development branch, but also a split in the developer community. In cryptocurrency a fork can lead to a chain split.
Chain split: A situation in which a blockchain splits into two separate chains temporarily or permanently. It can occur naturally (when two chains following the same consensus rules temporarily have the same accumulated proof-of-work and are both considered valid), or as a consequence of the use of two distinct sets of rules trying to govern the same blockchain.

It wasn't "one guy who came along and made it happen". Bitcoin builds on the ideas of Adam Back (Hashcash), Nick Szabo (Bitgold), of Hal Finney, of Wei Dai (b-money and the Crypto++ library) and many other cypherpunks. It was and it is a group effort and it's open source software.

Some weird and misleading definitions here. For example, a fork is a common concept in software development. There are dozens of Linux forks or forks of Open Office etc. A fork is not the same thing as a chain split.
Explanations for terms such as bears and bulls are weird, too.

A Lightning transaction is a Bitcoin transaction. It uses the multisig and n-lock time functionalities of Bitcoin. State channel technology such as Lightning was part of Satoshi Nakamoto's vision from the start, because he knew that Bitcoin would only be able to scale to millions of transactions per second via additional protocol layers. Therefore it is absolutely fine to write about Lightning on the Bitcoin subreddit.

That‘s an extremely silly thing to say. Neither MAST nor Schnorr signatures are „external solutions“. They are protocol optimizations. Ligtning is not an „external solution“ either, but an additional protocol layer. A Lightning transaction is a Bitcoin transaction, it uses Bitcoin‘s multisig and nLock time functiionalities. Please educate yourself before you post such nonsense.

Chinese miners are already setting up mining farms in other countries such as Canada.
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:59:31
Of the four things I listed, only one (Rootstock) is a sidechain - and an amazing one, because it's turing complete and even compatible to Ethereum smart contracts. There's nothing wrong with the expansion of Bitcoin via sidechains.
Schnorr signatures and MAST (Merklized Syntax Trees) optimizations that highly improve the efficiency and security of smart contracts. Calling these "band aids" is silly. 
Lightning is a state channel network - something Satoshi Nakamoto talked about before he vanished, because he knew that a Blockchain can not scale to millions of transactions per second without state channels. 
No other cryptocurrency has more developers and more innovation coming than Bitcoin. 2018 is an amazing year for Bitcoin.

I didn't say that Nick Szabo (or any other person I mentioned) was Satoshi. The exact identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is irrelevant. I was pointing towards the fact that the idea of cryptocurrency was debated and developed over several decades within the Cypherpunk community 
and culminated in the creation of Bitcoin within that movement - the same movement that fought and won the first crypto war against the US government's prohibition of private encryption. Many technologies we use today, such as PGP, BitTorrent, Signal and Bitcoin, were created by coders within the movement that fought for your right to use private encryption. The idea that Bitcoin was created by the same government that the Cypherpunk movement fought and won against is ridiculous.

The cost for a Segwit transaction is currently under 5 cent. Segwit adoption is at 10% only.

Sorry, but that explanation is very weird. There is no "forking from the blockchain" in Lightning, and there is no need to speak of a "main" blockchain (because Lightning is not a sidechain.) The Lightning network is a system of state channels established by smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain. They use Bitcoin's multisig and nLock time functions. Lightning will enable millions of instant transactions per second.

That's how I see it, too. Why care about the price now, if you believe in the importance of Bitcoin and its underlying technology.

news obviously do not influence the price much. you have to keep in mind that Bitcoin is in its infant stage right now, and there was only one block reward halving so far! there are so many new bitcoins being mined we have an inflation of 10%. of course the value is volatile, that's no surprise.

Once mined out, the Bitcoin network will have 21 million bitcoins, each of them 100 million satoshi. That's 2.1 quadrillion satoshi.

Is coinbase even a wallet? From what I saw when I logged on there once, they don't give you a private key - so it's not a wallet but a bank. Don't use fake wallets like that.

Then on the other hand, we could call it a deflationary currency when the growth of Bitcoin is smaller than the growth of the economy. So yeah... :)

In language there are many words that have different meanings. Date, right, type, stamp, jam, clip, crane... these words and many, many more. (Even the word football means different things in different areas of the world). The human brain is very good at distinguishing between multiple meanings. Bits as a denomination for 100 satoshis or a millionth of a bitcoin is easy to pronounce, easy to remember and it makes sense to people in terms of money being divided into 100 smaller units. I think bits will happen for these reasons, and the multiple meaning of the word bits is not relevant at all.

I'm sorry for your destroyed phone. Please keep in mind that the thing you call a "12-word pass phrase" is not a pass phrase at all. It's a cryptographic seed. From that seed you can create billions of private and public keys. And you are not supposed to lose that. Ever. This is hindsight, I know - but it's really important to keep this in mind.
Now for a solution to your problem: Find a smartphone repair shop. They can replace screens, it's not that expensive. And then write down your seed. Twice. And store it in different locations.

I think it's sad how many people use Coinbase - a website that does not even give them the private keys to their "wallets". Didn't they learn anything from the MtGox desaster? If you don't own the private key, you don't own the bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 09:47:24
Sorry to hear it's not so easy. I know from my own experience that the service guys always have to replace the whole front - also with a Nexus 5 for example, because the "screen" spare part is not just the screen but half the phone. So that's standard procedure - but I don't see a reason why they would have to wipe your phone. Maybe go to a phone repair shop instead of Sony - sometimes the small shops are much better at fixing phones.

The maximum number of 21 million bitcoins means there's a maximum number of 210 trillion bits or 21 quadrillion satoshi. The gross world product (GWP) currently is 85 trillion US$. So there will be enough bits or satoshi even if we manage to lose half of all mined BTC.

The question is not relevant at this time. Deflation means that the money supply is getting smaller.
That will not happen with Bitcoin for decades to come. Right now, Bitcoin has an inflation rate of 10%. See this graphic:
Bitcoin's algorithmic inflation will continue for many years, until the number of mined Bitcoins is smaller than Bitcoins that are lost - only then will we have deflation, and it won't matter, because Bitcoin can be divided infinitely.

You can buy and sell altcoins for bitcoins on Cryptsy or Shapeshift. I used to like altcoins and I am holding some Litecoin, Dogecoin and Darkcoin.

If you give a USB stick with your private key to a friend, that friend will have access to your bitcoins. You can use a password with the key. But I wouldn't recommend giving a private key to someone else.

You need the Core wallet only when you're a miner.

Some people may think this is about "freedom of speech" - a common misconception. Freedom of speech means that the government is not allowed to lock you up for saying your opinion. It does not mean that you must invite a well known scammer and liar to speak at your conference.

The Paycoin scam belongs here, because
1. customers of GAW mining were mining bitcoins, then did not get payouts and instead were promised Garza's premined paycoin
2. users paid Garza with bitcoins.
So the GAW/Paycoin operation was and is a scam designed to rob people of their bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:47:36
Bitcoin was not hacked and never will be.
A poorly programmed Exchange website was hacked, and people who had bitcoins there were stolen. Don't store bitcoins in a centralized web wallet. It's a decentralized cryptographic currency, so be sure to have your own private keys. If you don't own the private key, you don't own the bitcoin.

So effectively, Josh Garza is getting 30 more minutes to spread his lies. The websites of GAW and Paycoin tell you everything you need: GAW rents out "hashlet" asics that don't exist and Paycoin is a 97% premined cryptocurrency. Garza lied about cooperations that don't exist (amazon, walmart), and he lied about the guaranteed pricing "floor" of Paycoin. The forum on the GAW website is censored in the most extreme way, while Garza's PR agents spread lies about GAW and Paycoin in dozens of other forums. The whole operation is shady as hell, and now Garza plans to run his own cryptocurrency exchange, too. GAW/Paycoin is the biggest and most obvious cryptocurrency scam since MtGox.

The GAW/Paycoin scam was designed to steal bitcoins from people. 
People bought fake ASICs to mine bitcoins, then did not receive payouts and instead were promised the premined shitcoin. Many customers paid GAW in bitcoins. Therefore this scam belongs here - and if you don't want to read about it you don't have to read about it.

I don't believe in conspiracies. There are just more bitcoins on the market than people want to buy them at the moment. Until the next block reward halving, we have a monetary inflation of roughly 10%. Low market prices are to be expected. After 2 more halvings (year 2020) things will look very different.

Bitcoin so far had only one block reward halving. This is still early years, thousands of freshly mined bitcoins on the market every day. Hold for 2 more block reward halvings and see what happens. (The next halving is in 2016, and the next after that in 2020.)

If you have 14 BTC, then don't keep them in a wallet with a private key on your PC either. Your computer can be compromised with malware and a keylogger.

Don't use Coinbase as a wallet. If you don't own the private keys, the bitcoins are not yours.
@_date: 2015-01-08 13:53:55
Let'd do this again - based on the gross world product (which is about the same size as the M2). The gross world product is 60 trillion USD. 10 years from now there will be 18 million bitcoins mined. Because people hoard - let's assume - two thirds of them, 6 million bitcoins will be circulating. If bitcoin reaches a 10% share of the global currency market, that will be a market capitalizatoin of 6 trillion USD. 6 trillion USD divided by 6 million BTC = 1 million USD value per bitcoin. If bitcoin reaches only 1 percent share of the global currency market, that's a market capitalization of 600 billion USD, therefore a bitcoin would be worth 100 000 dollars.

It has everything to do with Bitcoin. Paying users at GAW were "mining" bitcoins (on fake ASICs that only existed as shiny renders on a website). One day users could not get their BTC payouts anymore. Instead they were offered Paycoin, GAW's own 97% premined shitcoin, also known as Paycoin. 
Since this is one of the largest ongoing Bitcoin scams, and its mastermind will speak at BTC Miami, it is very relevant in this subreddit.
@_date: 2015-01-04 12:03:42
Yes, high volatility is a direct effect of the high volume that can still be mined. We have a monetary inflation of 8% right now. Any currency with an inflation like that would be unstable. This will be better after the next block reward halving (2016), and really interesting after two more (2020).

Excellent statment. Jihan Wu should read it.
@_date: 2017-02-25 12:55:38
There are several fallacies in that article on Gizmodo. The 3 most important ones:
Bitcoin is not a "web based currency". Bitcoin is an internet protocol for the transfer of value. It's similiar to the protocols TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP or POP/SMTP.  It does not use the web to function.  
Chinese companies do not "control Bitcoin". The majority of mining operations is in China nowadays. If the Bitcoin protocol and network would fork into two networks, one of them called "Bitcoin New" and the other one called "Bitcoin Classic", a Bitcoin investor can sell his Bitcoin New for Bitcoin Classic, or vice versa, depending on which he thinks is the better idea. Therefore it's the investors, not the miners, who control Bitcoin.
Bitcoin exchanges are "prone to collapse" because they are companies and centralized entities. But Bitcoin is a decentralized, distributed peer-to-peer network. An exchange should be used solely for the purpose of changing currencies. It is not recommended to store money at an exchange. A Bitcoin wallet is a pair of cryptographic keys (public keys and private keys). If you own the private key of a wallet, the bitcoins are yours.
When something like this happens - an article full of mistakes written by a technology editor who is not an expert on the subject of Bitcoin - it's important to give feedback. Many of us here were skeptics when we first heard of Bitcoin. Be patient and keep explaining what this is all about.
@_date: 2014-12-18 21:06:45

Bitcoin is like a tracking stock, because all these banks and governments setting up their own blockchains will soon realize that they want to be on the biggest, most secure and most widely used network - the Bitcoin blockchain. Let them play with their own little altcoins, even the Chinese communists want one now. Good for them, they are getting used to cryptocurrency. Good for Bitcoin.

Very different situation. In the case of Ethereum, (1) the ETC team came up with the name "Ethereum Classic" themselves and (2) all the major exchanges decided to call the forked version ETH. With Bitcoin, 20 exchanges already announced that they will call the original chain BTC and the fork BTU.

A Lightning transaction is not provided by a third party. It is a real blockchain transaction, based on multisig and a native smart-contract scripting language. Lightning enables every bitcoin user to create a secure network of participants which are able to transact at high volume and high speed. In Bidirectional Payment Channels two participants create a ledger entry on the blockchain which requires both participants to sign off on any spending of funds. Lightning would be an extremely useful extension of the Bitcoin protocoll. And for Lightning to work the way it's supposed to, we should implement SegWit first - which would have the side effect of giving us more transactions per block right away (before Lightning could be implemented within the months or years to follow). Lightning is permissionsless - no third party needed. You can read more about how Lightning works here:

True, but the social dynamic was very different: ETC proponents were ignorant and afraid, while the Ethereum foundation had developers and the vision to go forward. Compare that the current situation in Bitcoin: BTU is afraid of Segwit and second layer protocols, Bitcoin Core has the developers and a vision. Therefore I believe that in case of a chain split, BTU would become the boring, worthless altcoin, while BTC with Segwit and Lightning would flourish. I don't believe a split will happen though. Reason will prevail.

I started out with the Oculus Rift Devkit 1 in 2013, then the DK2. When I got the Vive, I immediately fell in love with wireless motion controllers and the precise tracking - but the Vive headset feels considerably heavier, which is tiring in long sessions (especially when playing a simulator game such as Elite Dangerous). 
I prefer the Oculus Rift for its lighter weight and better comfort. In October 2016 I got the Oculus Touch controllers, and I also prefer them compared to the Vive Wands. The Oculus Touch controllers have capacitive sensors and recognize movements of the user's fingers. When using 3 sensors I get the same tracking precision I have with the Vive. The disadvantage here is that the Oculus sensors cause more cable mess than the Vive's sensors - something I am more than willing to deal with though for the greater comfort of the Rift and the superior capabilities of the Oculus Touch controllers.

Hm, okay, Multibit uses BIP 32, BIP 39 and BIP 44 seeds. That gives you a lot of options. E.g. Mycelium (I believe), and Bither, and of course a Trezor hardware wallet.
The different standards for HD seeds are annoying. I made a friend use Mycelium wallet on his Android phone to buy BTC. When he later switched to an iPhone, the iOS version of Mycelium used a different kind of seed and he couldn't get his bitcoins to show up in it. It's a bit ridiculous.
Your bitcoins are safe though. You just need to find a wallet that uses the same kind of seed you originally used.

If you don't hold the private key, the bitcoins are not yours. 
Coinbase "wallet" does not give you the privaze key, so that's a red flag. (I think the Coinbase "vault" gives you a private key). I don't use Coinbase "wallet" and instead recommend Mycelium (if you have an Android phone), Bread Wallet (if you have an iPhone), Green Address (PC) or Electrum (PC).

SegWit was not an "agreement", it was a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal. BIP141 (SegWit) reached 95% in the way it was supposed to from the start: by reaching consensus between the 5 constituencies of Bitcoin: miners, developers, merchant services, exchange services and wallet designers. 
"SegWit 2x" is the name for a roadmap some people at a conference agreed to. Most Bitcoin users were not part of that conference. I certainly was not there and did not agree to anything there. 
I am not opposed to an extension of Bitcoin blocks to 2MB. But it will have to be reached through nakamoto consensus (between miners, developers, merchant services, exchange services and wallet designers), not through votes by CEOs at a conference.

Coinbase is okay for buying bitcoins. Just don't leave any BTC on the exchange. A wallet that you don't hold the private keys for is never a good idea for storing bitcoins. Move the BTC to a wallet that you have the private key or seed for.

Segregated Witness is an upgrade of the Bitcoin protocol that solves several problems such as transaction malleability and the quadratic hashing problem. By doing that it enables bidirectional state channels, side chains, better security for hardware wallets etc.   
Thanks to SegWit we will have cross chain transcations (e.g. between Litecoin and Bitcoin), decentralized exchanges, millions of microtransactions per second and much more.
SegWit creates a bigger block, and in the bigger block all transactions contain signatures. Transactions without signatures continue to be invalid and signatures continue to be committed in blocks.  
SegWit does not, as conspiracy theorists sometimes claim, allow to write transacations without a signature into the blockchain. SegWit allows partial validators who do not check signature validity to do so without downloading the signatures themselves. This does not make invalid transactions valid. It does not make invalid blocks valid. It does not make invalid signatures valid. It does not make transactions without signatures valid. It does not remove signatures from blocks, as all block content continues to be committed in the block header. SegWit simply lets you verify non-witness transaction data without downloading (then discarding) the witnesses, which solves the problem of light clients having to download things they don’t care about.
For more clarifaction on the myths about SegWit, check this link:

Networks such as Bitcoin gain value in a nonlinear way as more users join them. When a network loses 20% of its users, the original network’s value is reduced to 64% of its original value, the new network is only worth 4% of the original, and they combine for a measly 68%. This is due to the synergistic effects of connected networks. Additional users bring connections to every existing member, and when subtracted, all these connections are lost. In a worst case, the network splits down the middle, both new networks are worth one quarter of the original, and the total value of both new networks added together is only half of the original. The sum of the parts is worth less than the whole.

AsicBoost is not a secret. Bitmain is holding one of several patents regarding Asicboost, and the inventors published a whitepaper.  
Bitmain tried to keep their usage of Asicboost a secret for a while, which is probably the reason why people said they're using "covert" asicboost. 


Segregated Witness, which was proposed in 2015 and will activate two weeks from now, disables AsicBoost.

A valid block is a block that follows the block validation rules of full nodes that stay in consensus with each other. BCH changed the rules without consensus and therefore forked off. BCH blocks are invalid and invisible to the Bitcoin blockchain, which is the reason why BCH blocks can never become Bitcoin blocks, no matter how long the BCH chain gets.

There is no such thing as "true", "fundamental" or "intrinsic" value - neither for paper money, nor for gold or bitcoin. Bitcoin however offers something that paper/fiat money and gold don't: A peer-to-peer network secured by cryptography and proof work, enabling internet users to send value without having to rely on a third party. This - and the networking effect - is what gives bitcoin value. How much the price of a single bitcoin token will be or could be is just speculation. One thing is for sure: The higher Bitcoin's price is, the more useful the network will be, because a higher bitcoin price enables more people to send more value.

It's similiar. However, entropy as a degree of order and disorder describes a system. Imagine molecules and atoms in a block of ice. Order is very strong in terms of their placement. As you increase the temperature, the system will become more disordered since it will become a liquid, the molecules will flow. Increase the temperature more and the molecules will become more disordered turning the water into steam. As you go from solid to gas, disorder increases. The entropy and its progress are measurable and predictable, whereas chaos usually describes randomness and unpredictability.

Bitcoin had user activated soft forks before, e.g. BIP16 was activated that way.
@_date: 2017-04-04 06:16:38
Except that it changed many times, so it's not dumb of me to say so at all. One change for example was BIP16, a new standard transaction type for the Bitcoin scripting system that defines additional validation rules for the new transactions. (That was a UASF by the way.) BIP34 introduced an upgrade path for versioned transactions and blocks. A unique value is added to newly produced coinbase transactions, and blocks are updated to version 2. BIP 112 introduced a new opcode (CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY) for the Bitcoin scripting system that allows execution pathways of a script to be restricted based on the age of the output being spent.
The list of protocol changes goes on and on.

Bitcoin never notified any of its costumers that the backdoor was there and that it could be used as an "anti theft feature". What good is such a feature when no one gets the information that it exists and the only people who know about it are those who created the code and those who analyze it? It's way too shady.

Yes. In the event that the economic majority does not support BIP148, users should remove software that enforces BIP148. A flag day activation for SegWit would be the next logical steps and require coordination of the community, most likely towards the end of 2018."

I'm not worried about that at all. Bitcoin is constantly changing and evolving and a lot of other projects are inspired by the innovations happening in Bitcoin, not the other way round. There are lots of upgrades and extensions coming to Bitcoin right now or later this year: Lightning networks, Merklized Abstract Syntax Trees, Schnorr signatures, Rootstock, ZKsnarks and many more. No other cryptocurrency has as many Github commits and as many developers. Bitcoin is a protocol and it has the largest network effect. There are some altcoins that I like, but I don't see any of them replacing Bitcoin, because Bitcoin is where the most development and the most exciting things are happening.

What Bitcoin really needs is not a PoW change, but faster difficulty adjustment via Gravity Well (each block). Currently, difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks, which usually takes 2 weeks but can be used as an attack vector against Bitcoin - and that's exactly what the mining cartel will try to do in November. BCH + B2X is a double attack, an attempt to bring the BTC blockchain to a grinding halt. If Bitcoin had faster difficulty adjustment via Gravity Well (like Monero and VTC have), this attack would not be possible.

Nullc, I respect your work and everything you've done for Bitcoin. But don't you think that difficulty being adjusted every 2016 blocks is Bitcoin's weakest spot? I don't think that B2X will succeed, but I can't get rid of the feeling that right now, Bitcoin is under a double attack via Bcash and B2X. In November the mining cartel will try to bring down the hashrate so much that blocks could take hours or days even, and difficulty might not adjust for months. The difficulty algorithm of Bitcoin is an attack vector, isn't it? I understand that Gravity well works for Monero, Vertcoin etc. But maybe there's something I'm overlooking here. What's "so horribly busted" about Gravity Well and why is a 2016 block adjustment better?
@_date: 2017-10-28 11:45:09

Funny that you mention the „internet bubble“ here. Because, you know, the internet did just fine after that. TCP/IP still worked, HTTP and POP/SMTP continued, FTP was okay. Why? Because in fact it was a stock market bubble. The internet didn’t care. Yes, there may be a bubble and a crash in Bitcoin that will destroy ICO money, startups and bad businessses. But Bitcoin - the internet protocol - will be just fine. Hint: Right after the so-called „internet bubble“ of March 2000, the largest businesses and platforms on the internet today (Youtube, Google, Facebook, iTunes, Amazon, eBay etc. etc.) were created.

Halvings of block rewards can go on forever, even when the block reward reaches 1 satoshi (in the year 2140), because it‘s trivial to implement more decimal numbers behind the 8 digits we have now. Furthermore, there are transaction fees. So mining can go on.

You got it wrong. Here‘s why:
A blockchain is one of several technological principles that make Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) work. Others are: proof of work and decentralized consensus. 
In the same way that packet switching is one of several inventions that make the internet protocol TCP/IP work, blockchain is one of several inventions that make Bitcoin work. And in the same way that nobody will want give up TCP/IP for another basic internet protocol (because everyone is using TCP/IP already and it‘s good enough), nobody will ask to replace Bitcoin for another protocol. Bitcoin has the biggest network effect and it‘s good enough.
Instead of replacing TCP/IP, additional protocols were built on top of it (for example HTTP, or BitTorrent).
Instead of replacing Bitcoin, additional layers are built on top of that (for example Lightning).
Don‘t believe the „blockchain is bigger than Bitcoin“ hype. People who say that usually don‘t consider the networking effect of Bitcoin as a protocol already in use. They furthermore overlook the fact that most innovation is happening in the Bitcoin space (thousands of Github commits in Bitcoin compared to very little in other cryptocurrencies) and most groundbreaking inventions (state channels etc.) are happening in Bitcoin. I do not see a realistic scenario where Bitcoin as an internet protocol for the transfer of value gets replaced by another one. On the contrary, Bitcoin is becoming stronger and more widely accepted with every passing day.

No, there's no need for that. Use it in your hot wallets though (Trezor, Ledger and Greenadress have Segwit already) - it's good for the network.

Some months ago I tried a Xapo wallet and it didn't allow me to store the private key myself. Never touched it again.  Their lying about B2X is one more reason to avoid Xapo.

So basically, B2X is ransomware now.
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:19:02
I don't think this would help. A hardfork with a change of PoW algorithm would lead to another chain split and therefore to a new altcoin + the original Bitcoin with SHA256. 
Also, there is an ASIC-resistant fork of Bitcoin already, called Vertcoin (VTC). It's pretty good even.

In the Lightning network you create smart contracts that use Bitcoin's nLock and multisig functionalities. A Lightning transaction is a Bitcoin transaction.
You can close a Lightning channel anytime and get back your unspent bitcoins from it. There is no "group" that controls Lightning - it's an open protocol, there are several software implementations, and everyone can run them to create a Lightning node. Furthermore,  Lightning uses onion routing (similiar to TOR), so it offers a high degree of privacy.

Plenty of mistakes. The author calls ETC a „fork of Ethereum“ although it‘s the unforked chain, and BCH an „upgrade“ of Bitcoin although it‘s an altcoin created via a hard fork. It‘s also unclear what he means when he writes that Litecoin‘s „transaction time“ is 4 times faster than Bitcoin’s - what he really means is block interval and the time it takes for a transaction to get confirmations. Both Bitcoin and Litecoin transactions are broadcast on the blockchain immediately and visible within a second - confirmation time varies depending on fees and mempool.

Bitpanda is a crypto broker similiar to Coinbase. You can buy BTC, ETH, DASH and LTC. You can also sell. The reason I like it is that Bitpanda offers many different payment options. Service is fast an reliable. I needed customer support once because of a minor problem and it was sorted within an hour. As usual, you need to register with ID and address (because of laws and KYC-regulations).

If you're in Europe, I recommend Bitpanda.
@_date: 2017-05-01 21:54:00
It's exponential growth, caused by short squeezes and by the fact that miners at these prices need to sell less bitcoins to pay for power, which makes the price go up even more. Of course growth seems extremely fast atm. And of course there will be another drop.  Then it will go up again, increasingly faster. Exponential growth is fun.

I sent a ticket to Poloniex 9 days ago. No answer yet. Their customer service is awful.
@_date: 2017-05-19 21:22:25
Vertcoin just did it. Before the activation of SegWit, one pool extended its hashrate to 51%. Users said they want SegWit and did a UASF. It worked fine, SegWit is active in VTC now and the team is working with Charlie Lee on cross chain transactions between Vertcoin and Litecoin via Lightning channels.
Furthermore, Bitcoin had a user activated soft fork once already. (If I'm not mistaken it was BIP9, but I'm not sure right now, I'd have to look up which one it was.) A UASF is not a "revolt". The way Bitcoin works is that miners find blocks and nodes validate them. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 14:31:19
The malleability fix ist part of it, because Lightning would be a lot more complicated and less functional without it - but SegWit offers a lot more, e.g. signature optimization and better utxo management. Also more block space, second layer support, better support for sidechains and for hardware wallets etc.

It doesn't take "forever" to confirm a bitcoin transaction. It takes 10 minutes per block, and you can see the transaction within seconds. the risk of someone faking a transaction when you sell something is extremely small, so for small transactions (such as a coffee or a sandwich) there is no need to wait for even a single confirmation - you can accept the bitcoin payment instantly. For larger deals (such as a car) you wait a couple of blocks - still a lot faster than a bank transfer. I don't see ANY need to use Ripple or any other altcoin just because "it's faster", because Bitcoin is fast enough. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 10:39:34

I think it's a bit misleading and counterproductive to call Lightning transactions "offchain".
In a Lightning channel, the balance sheets between users are regular 2-of-2 multisig transactions in the Bitcoin network. They are just not valid yet, because they are each missing one signature. A Lightning transaction is a Bitcoin transaction on a second layer, based on multisig on the blockchain.

Gross world product and the M2 money supply are both approximately 60 trillion dollars.  Ten years from now 18 million bitcoins will be mined. People will hoard two thirds, therefore 6 million bitcoins will circulate.  Let's assume M2 stays the same. Divide one percent of M2 by 6 million. If Bitcoin reaches 1% of M2,  1 BTC = 100 000 dollars. Divide 10% of M2 by 6 million:  1 BTC is 1 million US$.

I mean: A Bitoin wallet is a an application that allows you to write down or save a copy of your private key. Xapo is a fake wallet, because they don't give you the key. If you don't own the key, you don't own the bitcoin, you just own an IOU (a promise to get paid) - which means Xapo acts like a bank.

Coinbase Vault is not secure at all - because you don't even get a private key for that. If you want to hold larger amounts of Bitcoin, just generate a paperwallet on an offline computer, print it out twice and store it in a safe, undisclosed location.

I don't think that anybody will do that - because  paypal chargebacks are possible even weeks after the purchase.
there is one way though: On VirWox you can buy Linden Dollars with PayPal (L$, that's the Second Life currency), then exchange the L$ for Bitcoins. That works fast and reliable, but the fees are a bit high.

Just hold your bitcoins and be patient until 2021 (two more block reward halvings). Of course bitcoin is volatile atm, it has a relatively small userbase and 10% inflation right now. The userbase will grow and the inflation will go down due to reward halvings. There is absolutely no need to think about any investment schemes or scams. Buy as many bitcoins as you can and then wait for a few years.

I can't feel sorry for cloud mining companies that go bankrupt. Most of them are scams anyway, and mining should not be a business at all. Creating new bitcoins through mining is a side effect of validating transactions and supporting the bitcoin network.

It's not. Monetary deflation means that the money supply decreases. 
Bitcoin right now creates a block reward of 12.5 BTC every 10 minutes. That's a monetary inflation of 1800 BTC per day.
The block reward is halved every 4 years. Therefore Bitcoin has decreasing inflation.

Not necessarily. Anyone can run a Lightning node, and there is no need to set aside a lot of funds for it. A Lightning node is simply a wallet with one or more open Lightning channels. This should not be confused with a Bitcoin full node that validates Bitcoin blocks - although a full Bitcoin node's wallet may also be simultaneously used as a Lightning node to the advantage of the Lightning network user. Up until now, running a Bitcoin node does not earn any fees if you don't mine. With Lightning, your full node becomes able to earn fees, or you can configure your full-node to monitor the blockchain as a service which may also bring in some "micro-earnings".

Bitcoin has more development and innovation than any other cryptocurrency. Thousands of apps and projects are in development on GitHub and other repositories. Even if SegWit would not happen, Bitcoin will have sidechains such as Rootstock (which has the full Ethereum virtual machine built in and many more things). SegWit will happen and with it Lightning Networks, crosschain transactions, streaming money, decentralized exchanges etc. Yes, fees are high at the moment and that sucks. But every emerging technology runs into scaling problems as it grows. If Bitcoin would not grow, there would be no scaling problems, no high fees and no debate. But these problems will be solved, the future of Bitcoin looks great.
