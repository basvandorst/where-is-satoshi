As a long time customer of Coinbase i find the addition of ETH/ETC very confusing and a distraction from keeping things simple for new users(which should be your target audience). You guys held your ground for a long time only supporting bitcoin, knowing that having alts listed would be confusing to people. 
Why was there a sudden change of policy? 
From an end user standpoint it feels like it's opened Coinbase up to many more potential hacks/bugs etc. 
How do you plan on earning our trust back from this wreckless alt support?
@_date: 2016-08-09 18:39:38
Sorry, this doesn't sit well with me, where was the community demand? I don't remember being asked, why weren't us customers polled on how we felt about this?
Don't get me wrong I'm not a hater of alts or ETH specifically, this just felt like a wreckless move for very little gain...unless someone with power at Coinbase happened to be holding a large amount of ETH!
Can you see how this would change your customers perspective on the security and trust we have in your services?
@_date: 2016-04-26 20:17:39
looks like they trickled out of this address today, that has had over 50k bitcoins move through it in the last month 
@_date: 2016-04-22 18:00:21
Wouldn't that make the premium even higher not lower? if each share now contains less bitcoin.

"Mathematics make it appear possible but I believe there is a limit to what actual humans will pay for a small lump of something that is shiny and highly malleable but not particularly useful for anything but baubles.

Fake schedule...I don't see pickup large dessert drink anywhere on it. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 19:46:55
They already block the exchange for several states, so that shouldn't be an issue. The only thing left would be the regular wallet as you suggested.
@_date: 2015-06-03 17:03:06
Alright let's get Gemini launched. Then on to the ETF.

The shared key is stored encrypted so they don't have access to it without your password.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:55:40
They decided to keep these! :)  
they haven't announced the date yet.

@_date: 2015-06-01 18:50:03
I just find it interesting that with all the developments going on in the bitcoin space that anyone that has knowledge of bitcoin could think it is fading into obscurity. I guess if price is their only metric?

I wonder why you left $200 off...looks like it might be a decent time to buy! :)
@_date: 2015-06-03 22:11:45
for the multi-sig I set it up on my phone, then scanned the share code with my tablet, then scanned it to my pc, that completes the three keys. This makes it so someone needs to be in control of 2 of your devices in order to spend your coins.
@_date: 2015-06-03 19:15:04
No that is not correct.


We built the most secure and resilient solution possible. The 3-key architecture allows ease of use, easy backups, full security and complete control.
Use to recover if your password is lost.
COINBASE KEY
The only key that Coinbase stores. Enables you to sign transactions from your Coinbase account.
Sign transactions on Coinbase or if the User Key is lost
SHARED KEY
Encrypted with your password and stored both by you and Coinbase.
Sign transactions without Coinbase
USER KEY
Stored by you and can be used to sign transactions without Coinbase.

@_date: 2014-12-16 17:33:11
I think merchants hanging on to substantial amounts of Bitcoin is going to take awhile and it won't be done in 2015, but I bet more microtransaction type services will start exploding, and they are more likely to not cash out immediately.
The bigger piece to that will be driving adoption is the unbanked and countries with failing fiat currencies.
@_date: 2014-08-11 20:06:29
All the other costs? 
Why would you have to give your info over to a shady exchange?
It took the older generation longer to start using the internet as well, does that make the internet worthless?
hmm, Britain disagrees with you.
@_date: 2014-08-11 21:40:32
I view it as bad for 2 reasons: 
1. it costs us tax payers and consumers money to detect.
2. if I get a counterfeit bill dumped on me and try and spend it, I'm the one that is SOL.

Yes that happened 4 years ago, but please explain how these are still in circulation...
@_date: 2014-08-11 20:21:05
The bug that was exploited had to be a number that was really high in order for the bug to be exploited, so they couldn't create such a small fake amount.
"This was possible because the code used for checking transactions before including them in a block didn't account for the case of outputs so large that they overflowed when summed."
"Does anybody audit the blockchain to make sure the number of bitcoin in existence is correct?"

@_date: 2014-08-11 17:48:12
Oh, but a big difference, first if you wait for the confirmations this doesn't work and if you did have this happen, the coins would be un-spendable so they couldn't spread through the system like counterfeit fiat.

I agree Paypal filled a need and exists for a reason, but lets not kid ourselves thinking that there isn't a better solution, so lets compare some other pieces.
How about fees Paypal vs Bitcoin?
How about central authority, if Paypal wants to lock your account they can do it with no notice, lets see someone lock your Bitcoin wallet that you hold the private key to.
With Paypal how long after someone pays you do you have to worry about a chargeback?

If you are transacting with Bitcoins onchain and waiting for confirmations, you will not be a victim of counterfeiting PERIOD!
When I do face to face transactions, I prefer buying Bitcoin as apposed to selling Bitcoins as I have know way to determine if the fiat I'm accepting is legit or not.

In summer, they auctioned off 30,000 Bitcoins, and though the amount they sold for wasn’t disclosed, the rumor mill says they were sold at market price, which was $645 at the time.  In other words, the U.S. Marshals would have netted $19,350,000 on the deal, which isn’t exactly chump change.
And they’ve announced a new auction, slated for the 4th of December of this year, where 50,000 Bitcoins will be auctioned off in two rounds. The first round will consist of 10 blocks of 2,000 units while the next round will be made up of another 10 blocks but of 3,000 units.
Does this mean the government is insane? **By auctioning off Bitcoins, the government is admitting and validating their value. They are saying, essentially, that Bitcoins are not only legal but an accepted form of tender.** And with the government being the seller, new investors are joining the game who might have felt reticent about sourcing their virtual currency from unknown sellers previously."

It shows that it doesn't take a bunch of info in order for people to be curious. Check out one of the comments, "Bitcoin...I have seen this term referenced a lot...can someone explain to me what it is? Is there actual value to them? How are bitcoins limited in terms of use? Wiki only goes so far... What is a bitcoin valued in terms of $, how does one convert bitcoins to $?"
and erik voorhees stepped in to help them out.

I would love to see those numbers as well. The article seems to stop to sudden as well, where is this CAGR machine he speaks of?
"OK, then, let's put some recent Bitcoin price predictions into the CAGR machine and see what we come up with…"
edit: I found a calculator online and started it with 0.10, here are the results: Compound Annual Growth Rate:
and the link to the calculator
@_date: 2016-06-29 15:22:26
the calculator won't let me go less than a penny, and i'm not sure the prices from the first couple of years really count since there were only a handful of people that even new about it.
having said that:
This is at an assumed price of 0.01 from 2009
Compound Annual Growth Rate:
@_date: 2016-06-14 21:06:35
It's only a matter of time until a bank adopts bitcoin, it's no longer just about the blockchain
@_date: 2016-06-29 14:06:03
from his last line:
"OK, then, let's put some recent Bitcoin price predictions into the CAGR machine and see what we come up with…"
it looks like he was starting with $100 and ending with $600 over 3 periods.
if we try and maintain that 82% CAGR each year forecasted out into the future, here are some calculations(these all go off of his starting at $100 so 4 periods is just 1 year in the future 5 periods is 2 years into the future etc.):  4 periods = $1100;  5 periods = $2000;  6 periods = $3635;  7 periods = $6625;  8 periods = $12100;  9 periods = $22000;
@_date: 2017-01-17 22:54:53
contact 1hash, they are the ones that mined it, maybe they will feel bad for you.
@_date: 2016-06-29 16:39:54
Most of 2013 the price was under 100, you just got in at a high point. Good job on sticking with it though, you've held and added to you position for 2.5 years lets see what happens in the next 2.5 years!
@_date: 2017-01-10 19:12:22
not sure exactly what that's supposed to mean? I'll assume you are trying to say that bitcoin is bad because it's used for bad things...
no one claimed all use cases were going to be for good things, and you better stop using your favorite fiat currency...
@_date: 2017-01-04 16:51:16
I think we just witnessed his head exploding.
@_date: 2016-06-29 14:20:28
in 2009 it really never had a value, it wasn't until 2010 that it hit 0.10, i just used it as an assumed starting value.
if we forget about 2009 and say the price started at 0.10 in 2010 it gives us a Compound Annual Growth Rate:

Read the F'n article before you post...they clearly mention alts.
"On a percentage basis, a few other cryptocurrencies may have outperformed bitcoin, but their extremely low valuations mean they’re largely irrelevant to the global investing community. One example is Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. In January, a single ether token was worth $1. Now, it’s worth $7. Its price peaked above $20."

@_date: 2016-12-07 16:30:58
I've had good success with them, I just don't like how they went from talking about alts making it confusing for new users, when people were begging for LTC to be added to their site, to them suddenly jumping on the Ether bandwagon.
@_date: 2015-07-01 19:42:05
You could tell the main anchor was totally against Bitcoin. 
The fun part would be if even 100,000 investors tried to buy 1 bitcoin, not many are going to get them in the $200's!

My kids use it 100%, it is much easier for me and them, I give them their allowance in bitcoin, they buy games or gift cards and figured out how to use it in about 5 mins. 
It saves me time rather then giving them cash that I need to go to the bank to get and then have them give me the cash back if they want to purchase a product online, which I would then need to take back to the bank.

@_date: 2015-07-08 18:17:59
sure! It's really simple if you have multiple devices(phone,tablet,pc etc). 
Basically someone would need to be able to control two of your devices and know your passwords in order to spend your bitcoin.
I currently use  it's an open source wallet created by bitpay and is available for pretty much every device and os.
Download the wallet on your first device and it will walk you through setting it up. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 20:29:33
And probably less than that, as the price kept rising many of those asks would be pulled.
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:10:22
What is the transaction ID for the .00200740, did you include a fee?

that's worth chasing! good luck!
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:51:50
Looks like you used localbitcoins, so no you didn't control it, controlling an address means you control the private keys for that public address.
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:07:48
Copay meets a lot of those requirements. Check it out.
@_date: 2015-07-10 15:11:37
Nice, this is quickly becoming THE wallet! 
@_date: 2015-07-17 17:31:31
That would probably work as well, although I think Money resonates more with people than Ledger. lol
@_date: 2015-07-17 20:54:15
If you send bitcoin to any address you don't control the private keys for, there is potential that you are going to lose your bitcoins. With a sketchy site like this that potential for losing your bitcoins goes up.
Trust your gut!
@_date: 2015-07-08 14:18:41

@_date: 2015-07-17 21:38:14
I stated from the start that I find this simpler than cash...they typically want to make online purchases this is what led me to start paying them in bitcoin. 
I was tired of: 
getting cash from the bank&gt;give them the cash&gt;they want an online product&gt;I use my credit card&gt;they give me the cash&gt;I go deposit cash in bank
clearly this is beyond your comprehension...so i'm done here. Thanks
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:41:32
unfortunately the network is so busy right now that the standard fee is causing delays.
you only paid 1.16903633 sat/B, i think right now i saw 40 sat/B to be included in the next block.
@_date: 2015-07-02 01:50:50
@_date: 2015-07-23 16:34:57
Yeah i know how that works, I wanted to get clarification from the OP to see how he knew the balance. I'm skeptical that he forgot about these coins considering the dates of the transactions showing were right at the height of the 2013 bubble...
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:56:01
Could we get some proof that this is really you?
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:01:34
so they got the coins and then sent them on...
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:55:36
it's been awhile since i used localbitcoin, i think they add the fee automatically but maybe not. So what problem are you still having? is your end recipient claiming they didn't get the bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-07-07 18:34:00
Yep business as usual for my transactions as well.
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:48:31
Care to explain the process you go through currently? I can see the initial confusion and taking some time starting out, especially if it was a few years ago, but with the options available today, I can't see the 1+ hours.
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:20:30
You don't always have to buy a gift card, there are merchants that take bitcoin directly.
For in store purchases once you've purchased a card on gyft it is on your device and doesn't need a network connection so no issue.  
So you think setting up a google account requires the same information as setting up a bank account? A google account doesn't even need to be real information. Are you really this disconnected from reality?
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:44:23
they should have showed in there, just with 0 confirmations, it looks like your transaction wasn't included until this block 
the network for low or no fee transactions is running very slow right now because of some spam transactions.

It's another buttcoiner that creates a new account each day and then posts stupid crap in r/bitcoin. It seems to be happening more and more.
@_date: 2015-07-17 23:13:59
I can't see that as being a problem, every transaction is to a new address so figuring out how much they have in their wallet would be difficult. Also I make transactions as well, not just their allowance.

@_date: 2015-07-06 19:27:55
Thanks for the tip! Looks like your original post was deleted so i can't quite remember all of your requirements.
* 1. yes it creates a new address for each transaction
* 2. No
* 3. From Github:
Payment Protocol
Copay currently supports **BIP70** (Payment Protocol), with the following limitations:
Only one output is allowed. Payment requests that are more that one output are not supported.
Only standard Pay-to-pubkeyhash and Pay-to-scripthash scripts are supported (on payment requests). Other script types will cause the entire payment request to be rejected.
Memos from the customer to the server are not supported (i.e. there is no place to write messages to the server in the current UX)
@_date: 2015-07-06 19:37:14
no clue...it just says [removed]

I wouldn't waste any more time on zimmer, some people just love to argue...
Besides isn't it clear all open source projects die once their original developer stops developing for the project...oh wait bitcoin has somehow survived for another 4+ years! 
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:03:49


nope the bank account would require time and personal information to setup and then transfer time from my account for their allowance. A bitcoin wallet takes literally seconds to install on a phone.
bank account is not safer...with bitcoin there is no personal information included in the transaction.

the price series is now fixed.
@_date: 2016-10-29 13:01:00
Coincidence that the price has been on a fairly steady rise since the auctions started? 
It's not a ton of volume on these, but averaging 1400 bitcoin per day being taken off the market eating up most of the mined coins each day, if these investors are holding on to their purchases this could be creating some nice up pressure. 
@_date: 2016-10-11 20:32:15

Here is another one of his gems:
"There is a central authority who controls bitcoin and created the software. You may run the software on your computer, but you are using the software someone else created. If there were no central authority, Bitcoin would be worthless. Bitcoin also relies on the internet, so if the internet falls, Bitcoin is worthless. You cannot spend your currency. With every software, there is an exploit, and it must be updated to avoid it, hence why Motorola must update Droid daily. Once an exploit is found, however, it will be exploited. It may not be easy to hack, but it's just a matter of time until it is hacked.
And Dustin, I understand it fully. However, you seem to not be able to comprehend that distribution has to come from somewhere. **I know encryption. I understand how cryptocurrency works, however it is still hackable. I used to think Bitcoin was a great idea, then I figured out how computers work.**"

The hashrate didn't plummet after the first halvening...and it was the most "sudden" that we will ever experience 25 btc cut, this halving coming up will only be cutting 12.5 btc from the reward and so on, so each halvening is "smoothing out" the bonus reward.

He's still responding on there, looks like an idiot not a troll, looks like his first statement of "I know how bitcoin works." may have been a bit premature...
"So tell me, somebody has to hand out the Bitcoins, right? Somebody or some entity(s) controls all of the Bitcoin distribution, correct? If somebody were to theoretically control the distribution of Bitcoins, then they could then theoretically download the Bitcoins to an account they own, could they not? It's the same principle if someone hacked the Fed and took all the money for themselves. I'm not saying you could hack individually every single bitcoin on earth. That's obviously impossible. But he who controls distribution, controls currency."

The April bubble was caused by people trying to purchase asic miners, the first miners to market(avalon) could only be purchased with bitcoin, so a $1500 asic purchased with bitcoin we didn't care how much we were paying per bitcoin only that we need $1500 worth of bitcoin per machine we were purchasing.

This comment is my favorite:
"I know how bitcoin works. All it takes is one person to take it and copy and paste it. Billions of times if they wanted to. Its easier to inflate Bitcoin than the dollar."

To accept it without a 3rd party you will need to hook into the API reference (JSON-RPC)
