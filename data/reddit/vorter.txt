GA gets screwed for many bitcoin sites, it's infuriating. My only options are Gemini and Bitstamp (fuck Coinbase).
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:17:28
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:04:05
Yep. They only charge a 0.25% fee on purchases and sales.

Yeah USD ACH deposit seems to be the same. Still doesn't allow any BTC withdrawal until ACH clears.

Let's see how low we go.

Pop is right. 
I'm still holding until zero or 250+.

Bitfloor is instant, but it's through Bank of America which is only open when i'm in school. :/

Of course, this is reddit!

Err, at this current volatility, it is essentially gambling.
Unless you plan to hold for more than several months at the minimum, this could go downhill fast.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:32:59
Actually, nvm, I no longer wish to buy any.
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:20:47

For everyone else, volume.

Yeah we're all kicking ourselves for selling/not buying Bitcoins earlier.

Easiest instantly: BitInstant Cash Deposit (fill out a form and pay) 
BitInstant rips me off though ($4 + 4%)
Easiest if you have time: Dwolla deposit

So you're telling me this WASNT a speculative bubble?

Coinbase has a limited amount of sales per day and bitstamp is only Euro, unless you do an international bank wire which takes a few days AND has a minimum $15 fee.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:19:59
On one side, you're basically censoring what could otherwise be a free market.
On the other, the "free market" tends to favor that which is easily digestible (memes) over less digestible content that takes longer to read, but provides larger returns (though provoking discussions).
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:50:28
Eh, with PayPal sending money is free and if you load it up with cash beforehand it's instant. You could say getting bitcoins takes days from   a bank transfer but if you already have coins that's near instant too. There's no real risk of a freeze unless you're selling/moving large amounts of money.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:23:49
Plus PayPal is a douchebag. Holding my funds for a week because I'm "suspicious".

I already had it enabled on coinbase.

I'm guessing a trap?

Huh? Do you mean USD per bitcoin, because that hit 270 or so yesterday. But yeah, $200 is not what it lost. It's more around 150 AT MOST.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:09:12
Mtgox is frozen.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:35:42
It sounds like a bull trap, and with how "textbook" things have turned out, it may very well be.
We'll see, it could go either way.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:52:44
Okay pm me the PayPal address and I'll pm you back my bit coin address. 
It'll be 4 chunks of $23 at a time from me. You'll be sending 0.1 BTC at a time. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:16:31
Yup I use bitinstant to fund my Mt gox account. I'm looking to try using bit floor.

Mt gox is currently the only exchange that let's me get bitcoins instantly via cash deposit. Are there any other exchanges that I can use with cash deposit?

Obviously bitcoin is as stable and guaranteed as an FDIC-insured savings account!

1. Join a mining pool (sidebar)
Depending on your hardware, you could earn a few bucks worth a day
2. Well, maybe, if your kind of investing is high volality. People on here have both became millionaires and homeless within hours, so unless you are prepared to lose it all, then dont bother. Future? Possibly, but not now.
3. -$999999999-$999999999999

Bitinstant is cash deposit.

It's through BoA which has the usual "bank hours".
I'm at school the entire time.
CampBX has a Dwolla deposit (takes days) or money order and personal check, which also takes days.
