Is there a website that is respected to BTC news and future company markets getting involved? I’d really like to find out the most up to date information. I can only stare at the depth chart for so long ;)

An abbreviation for Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. Do your best to have informed discussion without causing the spread of FUD. Happy HODLing!

Pip hit the nail on the head. However. If you’re a crypto daytrader newb fag like me, the fun is certainly here. One moment it’s 12k, the next it’s 15! This is satisfying my gambling addiction. I’ve put in enough to have fun with, learn some things, and I do this while I research and learn more about BTC and crypto in general. Archiving every AnAnt video and digesting the substance to memory. It’s incredibly interesting. I’ve got some side hodl and this bit to play with. BUY ZE DIPZ.

Have you read anything on the right side of the Reddit (not on mobile)? That’s a good place to inform yourself of what it is, and see if you believe in it and it’s capabilities, and what that just might mean for the future. Do you think it’s a good idea? Do your research. Then answer for yourself! :D

Speaking of such noobs, do you have a good resource on some (accurate) basic marketing economic information on walls you could reference me? I find myself watching the walls being put up and then the events that follow after chaotic. I’d like to know more about those.
