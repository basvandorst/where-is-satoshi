One more point about signing a transaction with the right private key.
If the user have 0.2btc in a change address and another 0.2btc in another change address, can the user send  0.3btc to someone in 1 transaction only ?  In that case (if it is possible to combine btc from different addresses into 1 transaction to a destination adr) which private key to use to sign this transaction ?  Should the wallet sign this transaction with both private keys  (pk matching with the first change address and pk matching with the second) ?
The logic would be that I cannot send 0.3 btc in one transaction only (if we want to respect what has been said above: a transaction has to be signed with the PK matching with public key that has been used to generate the address). 
I have to use 2 transactions and sign each transaction individually with the 2 private keys matching with each of the 2 change addresses and pay 2 times the fee for for the miners.
Is it correct ?
What looks strange to me is that I don't see this kind of limitation in the usual bitcoin wallets available... usually, those walllets show me my btc balance.   I can always send some btc, whatever the transaction, without having to do 2 transactions and paying 2 times fee.  So, it should exist a way to combine small amounts of btc to make a bigger transaction .....  but what private key to use to sign a combination like that ?
