Well they have to stop trading at the end of the month.

Co-founder of Bitmain (hardware miner) well he certainly wouldn't say if exchanges close once and for all.

China is shutting down exchanges, nothing say they want to grant licenses and yes they want to introduce a digital yuan so people put money into this. According to latest rumors they might even use gfw (great firewall of china) to block everything related to bitcoin. Honestly nobody know right now.

I'm not even sure they want to allow fiat conversion for several reasons, rough translation:
"So the real focus is whether Bitcoins are of value in the real economy. At present, the country vigorously promote the economy off to reality, to encourage the real economic development. If Bitcoin does not have value in the real economy, but only the value of investment speculation, then limit its speculation, will help guide the funds from the bit currency speculation in the return to the real economy."

The way I understood it is they want money to flow into the real economy and to support their national currency, They might ban fiat -&gt; crypto and not only temporary.

If you read the people.cn article it's not as easy as that, we will see I guess.

or.. close.

It's not all conspiracy theory and fud, China governement wants to redirect money put in cryptocurrencies into real local economy and their national currency, they're also very afraid of capital evasion. China also plan to introduce their own crypto. They might or might not impose other technical measures. In the end you can think it's a problem or not.
