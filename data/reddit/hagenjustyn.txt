Can someone do an explain like I’m 5 for me on this one? Does that mean they mined and got bitcoin? How much bitcoin was mined? Do the people mining get to keep all of it? I saw there was a fee of $7000. What makes this worth it?

So what does the size and weight mean?

Ugh. I don’t get why there’s so much division. It’s toxic almost. Openly promote both or stfu.

Oh I see what’s going on. The post is saying that Bitcoin Core is the new experimental coin claiming that BCH is the one true Bitcoin. I get what they’re saying but it’s misleading.

Isn’t that the truth though? Bitcoin has evolved and become something different from the original white papers and bitcoin cash was created to carry on the original guidelines. Which is a better coin/formula is hearsay. Or am I mistaken?

Good. That dude is a joke and is bad for Bitcoin

Wait isn’t this the opposite of what we want?
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:17:16
Seems legit.

I wish he had answered Tone’s final question which was, once BCH scales to the same amount of transaction volume that BTC currently has, how much will fees be then
@_date: 2019-05-04 00:08:10
Funny, if true!

When’s bitcoin hitting 100K guys :F
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:45:21
True but it’s not like the S&amp;P goes up 20+% in a week either. It’s not that volatile.
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:09:55
What did it cost?

You’re going to be thiccc

Crashed is a strong word. Pulled back or consolidated is what you’re looking for
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:39:40
There is no hope left for bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:17:18
Woah woah woah now. Let’s not get too crazy here. Lol
