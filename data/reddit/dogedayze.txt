contact Coinbase and BitPay.  BitPay does instant verifications (they process the sale and credit you instantly).  No chargeback= fewer scams.

under what situations current or future could bitcoin be lent out in a fractional reserve manner?  is it ever possible for bitcoin to be rehypothecated?

I just checked 20 secs ago and it is still up over my purchase price.  I bought today.  Perhaps you should buy some as well.

I hope it works out.  thanks for the positive vibes...  rare on the internet, but I am getting mauled like everyone else on the bitcoin.

they could be isolated and "colored."  there is no way Karpeles buys a country and makes himself emperor.  adaptions to bitcoin software could be implemented.
even if Karpeles has a tremendous amount of bitcoins, he will be hounded and tracked for years.

I'll go there.  thanks for the heads up.

PERHAPS THAT IS THE EBAY PREMIUM.  I DON'T KNOW.  
I'VE FOLLOWED EBAY CASASCIUS PRICES SINCE I BOUGHT THEM ON EBAY LAST SUMMER.  THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AT LEAST 50% HIGHER THAN THE BTC PRICE.
BITSTAMP PLUS 10% ISN'T APPEALING.  AT THAT LEVEL, I'D RATHER KEEP THEM AND NOT BE BOTHERED.  I AM NOT DESPARATE.

Fractional reserve bitcoin banking or straight up bucketing funds...  it is the only plausible explanation.  Hopefully, we someday find out the truth and soon.

People are quite authoritative about subjects they only partially understand or don't understand at all.  I see a lot of schadenfreude with people gloating as they assume I am losing my a$$ in gold and silver.  Turns out they saw some news snippet where a talking head said gold and silver are tanking.  No analysis, no research, no critical thinking, no objectivity just I must be losing my a$$ and gold is going to drop big time because someone told me so on TV.  
I get less schadenfreude with bitcoin because most people don't really have a clue what it is.  They parrot talking head opinions like w/ gold and silver.  But talking with these nuts (ex police chiefs, teachers, Dave Ramsey devotees etc.) it is clear they don't have a clue what bitcoin is but just parrot the the talking head snippet they watched.  Its scary that people are so sheepish.

I will bet $50,000 that BTC does not reach his price target.  I do not expect to be contacted by him but am serious.  
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:58:51
why save money somewhere when you are losing it, duh?  stick to a losings account.  (inflation)

I really liked this.  despite my r/alias I actually am a bitcoin guy and think doge doesn't have a long future.

Whether goxxers somehow get made whole or not, I empathize with y'all.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:35:31
no the price hasn't really gone down priced in bitcoin.  I could have left my  bitcoin in bitcoin.  gee wow.  oh, they are long bitcoin and can't hedge.  so what.  when it comes down to it, most businesses can't totally hedge.  I haven't lost anything priced in bitcoin.  it isn't an emergency no need for condolences.  congrats on your brilliance.

or a potential investor dupes gox into manipulating the price lower for potential investor's gain and then jilts gox at the altar...  "oh gee, we didn't know it was this bad.  no thanks."  whatever comes of this will be most interesting.

**I don't have the background knowledge of a lot of you;  I've only been seriously following and investing in BTC since last summer.  My knowledge of BTC history is incomplete.
My theory is they were hacked and lost the coins back in 2011 and have been acting on a fractional reserve basis since.  They may have also had proprietary trading losses.  Perhaps some of the coins still exist but not enough to continue the charade.  Hence, gox throws in the towel.  The idea may have been that they were trying to trade back and earn back the lost coins.  This theory would possibly explain the recent goxbtc trading which seems to have been unnatural and manipulated.  Perhaps the horrendous recent PR was an attempt at manipulation.  The idea being to arbitrage enough coins to keep going.  Another possibility is that gox didn't have any significant BTC for some time and was bucketing the orders while perhaps proprietary trading and attempting to manipulate the market.  It wouldn't be surprising to learn of cohorts, whether with direct or indirect involvement, trying to manipulate prices for gains.  Abject criminal involvement ala the Yakuza or Russian mafia or the like would seem unlikely; Mark could bail out of that on air and ask for protection from state depts and the like.  That would probably be his only choice.  I don't think a government or group of governments acting covertly would leave so many loose strings and unanswered questions.

My mom was negative on bitcoin.  Then I gave her 2 1.0 Casascious btc coins for Christmas and made her half a bitcoin on a dogecoin trade.  She has since integrated bitcoin into her store and is positive on crypto.
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:48:47
this is the conclusion I have come to.  I considered mining for bitcoin and litecoin and couldn't justify it versus just buying the coins.  I could not justify buying mining shares also.
