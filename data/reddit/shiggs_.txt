Why would a miner be confirming invalid transactions if he only puts valid transactions into a block that only he received and did not pass on to other nodes? He then would of course share ( assuming he's the first to find it and if not keep the transaction for himself until he finds a valid one) the block with every other node to claim the reward and the extra fees. So the double spending should not be a problem here. 
Of course it is not as important as the security of the whole system, but every single miner has than an incentive to deviate and not share. :/
What am i missing? That's why i was asking if there is a way to punish nodes that do not pass on transactions and mine them only for themselves.

I get that and that is where my question is coming from. If all nodes were miners, there might not be a passing of transactions to other nodes, since miners might be selfish and want to claim the transaction fees for themselves. Am i correct?

yea my bad. kinda confused. can u explain to me how transitions get into the memory pool then?

okay thanks! So if there is no incentive for miners to relay transactions, is it significantly important that there are a huge amount of nodes that do not mine, for the network to be stable?

My bad! I was talking about nodes. But i still don't  quite get it. For me as a person without a bitcoin node. Do I have to reach out to a node with my transaction data and hope for them to pass it on to other nodes? What is the incentive for miners ( that run a node and receive such a transaction containing especially high fees) to pass on the transaction?

You da real MVP hahah

You need your old 24 recover words in order to recover your wallet. That's why you should write them down in case you'd lose your trezor

I think you just connect your empty trezor and select the option to recover your wallet. Then you enter your 24 words and you should be good.

Yeah thank you haha. I'm just curious how it works because they say that you are the only one owning your private keys. So what I meant was how can I recover my private keys without them knowing/saving them?

Thats the answer I was looking for! Thanks m8
