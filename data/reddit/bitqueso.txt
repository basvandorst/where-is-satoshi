These types of posts are why there are no longer high-powered VC's on this sub.

These are the types of posts that make people disrespect this sub.  You know full well the event has already happened and yet don't put it in the title.  Click bait idiotic bullshit.

You and your Mom are not ready yet.  Bitcoin is still very much at an innovator/early adopter stage.  This is why it attracts so many forward-thinkers with strong political opinions. 
However, even though we're largely under construction at the moment, if you pay attention, you'll find average consumers benefitting.  A few examples...
If you buy stuff on Amazon, you can get discounts via Purse.io.  
A couple weeks ago, average consumers in Argentina were banned from using credit cards to hail Ubers, but now they can via bitcoin.
Average consumers don't like ads so they may use the forthcoming Brave browser, which just received 8.5MM in funding with tech built using Bitcoin.
So the space is being built out and more and more advantages are coming to light.   Maybe as we enter the early majority phase, you'll see more of your friends using Bitcoin and then find a benefit that strikes a chord with you.  
But for now, it's an industry filled with many passionate people working to solve very large problems with the current status quo.

Already done.  That wasn't what I was asking for.  
@_date: 2016-04-30 23:39:32
Already done.  Not what I'm asking for.  There's a reason Andreas is our top evangelist.
@_date: 2014-02-10 07:22:20
Yes, thank you.  With Coinbase, If I don't request a certain amount, it still shows as zero.  Doesn't look like they allow you to remove it.
@_date: 2014-12-04 17:25:21
Do you guys have any of the Chase logo bitcoin shirts left over in an medium?  Don't see it on your site anymore.

@_date: 2014-02-10 07:24:23
Awesome.  Got it now.  Thanks!
@_date: 2014-02-10 07:04:40
Ummm, ELI 5 please?
@_date: 2014-12-04 21:54:01
It said bitcoin but in the font of the Chase logo?  Could have been another company...sorry
@_date: 2014-05-13 22:32:55
Any BKK redditors you can intro me to who are doing it on the cheap?   Considering a 3 mo. or so stay and would appreciate some insight.
@_date: 2014-07-06 20:45:20
I'll help.  It's definitely not mybitcoinatm.com
@_date: 2015-05-28 06:57:28
Can someone relatively new to BTC ELI 5 this for me?
@_date: 2015-05-29 08:25:11
Ah thanks. Didn't know that about getting to choose which transactions are written in.  It has to be a certain amount though correct?

"...names are very important for widespread adoption." 
Let me get off REDDIT and go search GOOGLE for a better alternative to EBAY.  
@_date: 2015-05-28 08:18:47
lol I have a handle on bitcoin itself, but if you could break down OP's commentary.  
@_date: 2015-05-28 21:24:31
thx!  Mind further explaining the "21 inc's mining pool will certainly "win" the bitcoin mining competition so often that they could include all 21 inc's transactions (maybe even blacklisting all others) at zero fee" part?  How does that happen?
@_date: 2014-07-31 17:23:39
check out fiverr.  they even accept btc.
@_date: 2016-01-11 01:36:58
If I give my wallet address, can I mail order you?
@_date: 2016-03-28 15:06:25
This is actually good news.  No really.  We want someone inept in that role.
@_date: 2016-03-24 22:48:01
Or better yet, take your chances on Bitcoin instead!

A major part of Sanders' campaign platform is breaking up large financial institutions.
@_date: 2016-01-19 09:28:03
No, the point of the open ended question is to get the discussion flowing around more talking points than just what his presidency would mean if he were to break up the large financial institutions.  I'd like to hear as many opinions as possible re: what a Sanders presidency might mean for Bitcoin.

Disagree as this could generate the press needed to counter Vivek's current headlines.  
Hoping Wences is hinting at something he's already learned at his time at Paypal.
@_date: 2016-06-24 06:13:29
It's been done: 
@_date: 2016-06-21 18:53:23
@_date: 2016-06-25 00:22:19
This is actually good news.
@_date: 2015-07-28 19:29:45
It doesn't say smart person. It's too over the top and thus, grabs attention in a negative way.  
@_date: 2016-02-05 07:51:47
Between Paypal's ownership of Braintree which is integrated with Coinbase, and Wences' recent board seat appointment, I'm more of the mindset that good news is on the horizon. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:33:58
Please don't do this.  
@_date: 2016-02-02 06:33:48
He even let them name the new Warriors stadium the Chase Center.

Great news!  Especially considering what's going on with their currency recently.
@_date: 2016-10-28 15:54:12
Mind ELI:5-ing the post and your comment?
@_date: 2015-11-11 04:12:36
@_date: 2016-05-01 17:26:42
thanks. I do like this one.
@_date: 2015-11-09 16:21:47
It won't look good because the QR code will show through to the other side, obfuscating the B.
@_date: 2016-05-01 17:25:04
Nah, I would say Andreas is an incredible asset to the community.
@_date: 2016-05-01 17:26:01
Already done.  I want her to understand it from a global perspective.
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:45:55
Well, it's not original: 
@_date: 2015-11-11 03:42:45
You don't think it's manipulation?
@_date: 2015-03-02 23:36:38
@_date: 2015-11-11 03:58:26
that's kind of implied bro
