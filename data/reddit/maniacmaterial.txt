Ahh. I didn't. I bought a week ago and kept it in bch. Now I have more btc value than I would have holding btc.

seems a little harsh 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:50:17
Hahahahahahahahha how is that working out for you right now?

Well at this point, we exchange BTC for every type of alt. And I don't see that being any different for a good couple of years.

Regardless of your opinion towards BCH, your reckless approach to handling it is kind of ridiculous. 
It doesn't sound you're very knowledgeable as to what a hard fork is. 
Did you have BTC on the date of BCH fork? Do you know when that date was? Do you know how to access it in the first place? Have you considered the moves you're making relative to price in order to get yourself the best deal if you truly wish to sell your BCH now (as opposed to any other time) in order to buy BTC now (as opposed to any other time)? 
Hard forks aren't free money. But sometimes they do create an asset that has value. I wouldn't be so quick to throw any coin away that you got for doing absolutely jack-squat just because of a personal bias.
Further more, the question "is that safe?" doesn't even make sense. Is it safe to use an exchange? Is that what you're asking?

I also don't like the fact that I'm not allowed to trade whatever the fuck I please. Countless times I've had and then not had bitcoin cash. I'm here to make money, I don't know what these kids are here for.

I don't even have any bch ���� I'm on your team bud. I trade alts to accumulate btc and btc alone. I just thought he was lacking knowledge 
Also it seems you are too as you don't know what FUD means. I didn't fud bitcoin in the slightest. I am bullish on bitcoin for the rest of forever.

Right well this isn't NASDAQ.

This still should not be encouraged and is harmful for anyone who can actually afford having Bitcoin.

4 million, and no. It could mean that, but it isnt guaranteed.

You know how when there's an incoming transfer into your electrum wallet, you can see that it's coming, but that it's not quite confirmed? Yeah that hasn't even happened yet. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 04:43:04
I didn't do anything differently than I have done in the past for 50+ transfers from Coinbase to Electrum. I didn't know you could change the fee on Coinbase.
