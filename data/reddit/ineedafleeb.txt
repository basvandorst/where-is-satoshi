Clearly you don't know your history. The first thing he did was to privatize national assetts. The government didnt control the corporations, just the workers..... Stop reading Breitbart mate and get a grip on reality

You need to read up on what hard left and hard right means. If he was hard left why did he support private enterprise?

Do you understand what a ponzi scheme is?

Wow you've made so many mistakes its laughable. Get off 4chan buddy, you sound like a nutcase. 
The Nazis were not socialist, they were on the opposite side of the spectrum. None-socialist states have also commuted genocide. And most of the right wing are anti immigration to some degree.
I'm centre right, and you my freind, need to stop looking at fake news that fits your bias.

I've been interested in Crypto for quite some time now and to deny that there is no similarites to a ponzi scheme is absurd. Albeit it is more like a pyramid scheme, well technically it is a pyramid scheme. Just a successful one.
I mean it has no use cases at this moment in time except for nefarious uses. It has not been proven to be an effective currency. 
And the value it has today is from people buying and expecting a return I.e. the next fool paying more than you did. And the fact that it is NOT evenly distributed among holders

Very good point u/jstolfi. I do like to read well constructed arguments against Bitcoin as much as for it. I applaud your professionalism in replying to people who don't seem to get your thought process, which is very logical. I dislike the sudden hate when someone has a different view point to them and they seem to think 'you just don't get it' with no argument back to you, or a lady one.
The amount of attention Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies has got is staggering. What this is telling me the most is the the overwhelming lack of faith in our current financial system; my analysis of people investing tend to be people who have little faith in our set-up. This has cause a massive price surge into an interesting technology which I believe is lacklustre and unfair. 
Any argument made against our current financial system can be made against bitcoin. Bitcoin and USD are very top heavy; they both have 1% of the people controlling 50% of the supply. 
This being said. The fundamental technology behind Bitcoin is very interesting and I believe multiple use cases will sprout out of it in the future. And we may even be seeing the start of it with Ethereum.
