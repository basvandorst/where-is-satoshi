Me too, buy on Coinbase and transfer to GDAX. 
Only because i'm not paying another £15 to send a new SEPA transfer to a new exchange.

Wow i *really* misunderstood how mining works! No wonder crypto gets bad press...
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:09:41
[UK meaning](
Just a joke

SrGrafo posts blank templates for people to use.

I think being a motivational speaker is your lifes calling. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:29:43
You're on the internet, and yet this seems to surprise you....
@_date: 2019-07-11 17:35:20
Don't crop the original artists name from the template. Dick move.
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:03:44
Yeah exactly my thoughts.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:33:19
Don't get your news from *any* single source.
(Whoops, deleted original comment)
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:57:17
No no, it was a mastabatorium.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:44:04
Hodl doesn't mean not buy more... 
@_date: 2018-09-09 01:02:23
Stop pulling imaginary figures/claims out of your arse. You do nobody interested in BTC any favours.
@_date: 2018-10-02 07:53:29


OP is an estate agent not a financial advisor.

Not enough spreadsheets

I bought my 1st house at about 24, after renting my own place from 18. All my own money, in a job with an apprenticeship.
If you dont piss your money down the drain and be semi-sensible you can absolutely buy a house. Granted London is a horror-show though.
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:47:21
And? What do those 2 figures have to do with each other?
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:49:58
Sorry if i'm asking a stupid question, but I only have BTC showing in my Electrum wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:49:01
It says in the article...
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:33:39
Am i correct in thinking i use the same address as my BTC holdings?
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:21:52
[I hate you all]( ❤
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:46:17
Checkout the cryptocompare.com BTC forum. Wow! 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:25:48
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:13:36
That was the same.
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:36:33
Do this for every x1000 milestone.
@_date: 2017-10-08 13:57:22
Is that not obvious?
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:46:24
So we're just allowing non-BTC posts with flat out false claims now? Shit like this does nothing to help the cause for crypto in general.
@_date: 2017-10-11 07:37:05
It seems to be a thing with BTC. It's almost like a religion to some people, unfortunately it's the case of the noisy minority. Check out the forums on cryptocompare forums....
I just want to find somewhere to find sensible mature info &amp; news without all this wierd fan-boy shit! 
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:02:05
Room for one more?
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:28:36
Hmmm am I in r/bitcoinzimbabwe?
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:50:48
Thats always my excuse too...
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:38:43
Because a lot of people are thinking longer terms than a month.
@_date: 2018-07-01 12:41:31
So I take it you will be remortgaging all your properties and buying BTC with it yes?
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:22:19
Scamming her parents for BTC
@_date: 2018-07-01 12:06:59


That's exactly my point.


I don't know, as I said, London is a horror show for property.
@_date: 2018-07-01 00:01:35
And once you have the deposit paid its cost-neutral or not a great deal extra to pay a mortgage as you don't pay rent anymore.
Rent is more expensive than a mortgage for an equivalent property where i'm from.
@_date: 2018-07-27 19:28:58
Send me your BTC and i'll send you back double.
@_date: 2018-07-01 12:11:19


Oh don't be so pedantic with terms. Yes i *do* own my house, all the paperwork and rights are in my name, not the bank. I owe money to the bank, they don't own my house. Having something as collateral isn't owning it.


Yup, which I said myself...
@_date: 2018-04-17 07:30:44
2018 will be Bitcoin by the end of $100,000
