1. Bitcoin scarcity means jack shit when it can be divided infinitely into smaller units (something the $ cannot do). The number of Bitcoins may be finite, but the number of satoshis isn't. There will always be "bits" on the market to buy, no matter the price.
2. Bitcoin can and probably will be regulated and taxed just as any other commodity\currency. It is by no means "censorship resistant". If the U.S government decides tomorrow that Bitcoin is illegal, Bitcoin will be dead, for all intents and purposes, the day after tomorrow.

Cool! Just what I asked for :)

Kudos. Looks handy.
Are you going to support BTC China anytime soon?

I just get a kick from seeing how many Bitcoin cuckoos are out there. Apparently, at least 20% are mad hatters.

Gay black Jewish vegetarian dude that invested in Bitcoins.
Talk about having a rough time..

People turn to gold or Dollar or the equivalent. There is always, always a market for buying these. Legit or black.

Thats just a regular tip with extra steps.

"We have experienced some delays with payment processing..."
Favorite sentence of every scam-service ever.
@_date: 2015-08-01 17:53:20
That is beside the point and non-relevant.
History owes you nothing. If tomorrow the US goes down in flames and the dollar evaporates, then you're fucked. No compensation deserved. The day after tomorrow you'll find a new kind of government rising printing its own new currency. No chance of a non-governed kumbaya chanting commune. Thats non-realistic hippie crap. You need police, armies and courts to hold together millions without chaos.   
Nothing is certain except death and taxes.
Oh yeah, and some sort of central government and its currency.

1) Every government that has fallen in the history of the world was replaced by another government.
2) Every form of government produces its own currency.
3) Math

Bitcoin has great potential.
But fiat money ain't going nowhere.
Best case scenario is that Bitcoin goes mainstream and is just another legitimate currency out there. 
Thinking Bitcoin will *replace* the current money system is a cuckoos pipe dream... 
@_date: 2015-10-22 17:51:37
Yep. I agree. That pretty much sums it up..

Also, $99 for a report titled "Who Really Uses Bitcoin?".
Here's your answer, free of charge. No one.
No one uses Bitcoin (darknet markerts excluded).
