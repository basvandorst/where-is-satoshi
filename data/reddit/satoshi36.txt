Why have we created satoshi36, since there is a number of bitcoin lotteries already in use?
The answer is simple – other lotteries fail to represent the very process of a game; moreover, we find them to be not so user-friendly. 
What satoshi36 does is to bring together a convenient interface designed by a good usability bureau and a clear and transparent algorithm for making a bet and following the result. 
Satoshi36 is a new-generation lottery. Perfectly fair and giving an opportunity to use mathematical algorithms and your own skill rather than face a risk of fraud, as in classical lottery. 
Importantly, bets in satoshi36 lottery are only accepted in bitcoin, to make sure that the transaction is instantly processed and guarantee the transparency of the system, so that no one can block or cancel your bet.
