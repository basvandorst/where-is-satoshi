Of course not. We are talking about the guy who's only going to invest in what he understands. He gave Google and Facebook a pass because of this.

My guess here would be the obvious relationship, they are all cryptocurrencies. Sometimes the market changes capital from one sector to the other (recent example for this, very simplified, past Thursday to Friday: massive capital moved from tech to finance. You could follow that money quite easily observing their respective indices) 
So to answer your question, crypto currencies make up a new sector that is and will even more so be used as a stable tool that people incooperate into their investment strategies (to hedge, diversify etc.). 
The market bundles them when it comes to sentiment as they do for example automotive companies, certain commodities, real estate, banks, biotech etc. pp. 
Adding to this, there are many more valid reasons why crypto correleates the way it does:
- often similar underlying technology / conception 
- touched by the same laws and policies 
- often too similar in name / goal / story
- too unknown or abstract for a majority -&gt; generalised 
- those that are crypto affine in the market often heavily diversify within the sector (somebody who might have had success with bitcurrency A buys also B and C because said person believes in the grand concept rather than in a single coin....)
- lots that invest in cryptocurrencies are alternative investors that have never invested in anything else before 
- it's been all over the news and under medial focus that even little news could be headlining and stirring up buying and selling surges of relatively inexperienced investors 
I could go on if you like it

That was what I was thinking, too.
I reckon there will be some analytic doing a piece on it tomorrow. I'll update here once I figured it out.
*edit: I researched the matter again a couple of days later and afaik there really wasn't an event directly correlating that market change across crypto. Might have been the mentioned whale, then.

What did cause you that huge spike today? Went up so much in 30 minutes that there got to be correlation to an event.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:43:42
Well, no. The spike was evident for most major bitcurrencies. Even more accentuated for Bitcoin Gold and Cash. (12% gains in 30 minutes in comparison to 6% of bitcoin)
My guess would be a popular exchange opened up  bitcurrency trading to their customer base? Might as well have been an entirely different reason. Like news leakage or influencer commenting.
