FTFY. Templars holding and guaranteeing wealth for those on pilgrimage to the holy land are the basis for modern banking.

Yes, yes it does. It up to the BUYER to be aware of the laws relevant to his or her purchase. This article is grossly misleading, as a semi-automatic firearm is not synonymous with a machine gun.

So if I order with bitcoin, will you ship my shirts then? Fiat didn't seem to work.

I'm a statist.

I was aware of that. Its a general whine about the lead time, not a *real* complaint. It's only been a week since I ordered. Pretty on-the-ball with that response though, ty.

Demonoid is gone, stop perpetuating the honeypot that sits in its place.

Life savings? Into something volitile? I believe in bitcoin's potential but that's borderline predatory and a good way to risk your relationship with your family.

Idk man, I am reminded of the time I was training in Oaklahoma City and after a couple of months I felt an overwhelming desire for mexican food. It was bad and I felt bad for eating it. The Alibi summed it up when the food critic said "the mexican food there would get you stabbed if you tried to serve it here [Albuquerque]".

I would trust a German to make Texan food. This is within acceptable parameters. I just might stop in if I manage to get to Berlin someday, thank you :-)

As a new mexican, the last thing I want to eat is an enchilada made in Berlin...

He seems just fine, fgt.

That's not a gun. That's a stick that has bullet-firing capability.

You haven't bought a gun lately, have you? That's some theory:practice disconnect, right there.
