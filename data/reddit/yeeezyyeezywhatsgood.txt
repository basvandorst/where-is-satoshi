I know you guys love to hate banks, but they do a pretty good job storing money securely yet making it spendable everywhere.
meanwhile crypto has hacks and founders "dying" with millions of stolen currency
I'm happy to have made a little money with btc but also glad I can withdraw to a real account

a run on the banks is hardly "helping themselves"
but seriously..  it'd be interesting to compare money lost per user between 2009-2019 that was in BTC vs in real banks.  maybe in some extremely volatile countries it's better to have BTC if you're about to leave before the country crashes.  I doubt BTC wins any other cases

true -- I am mixing these things.  although there is a lot of value lost in BTC indirectly e.g. via energy costs or increased hardware costs 
on the other hand... can you imagine how fucked we would all be if everyone held onto their own money? want a loan? nope.  want interest? nope.  want to regulate inflation? nope.  these are very basic things that society relies on (for good reason)

it's pretty hard to regulate something intently immutable and decentralised

have you heard him talk? he's a lot but not hype at all 
@_date: 2019-02-08 07:34:31
true.  begs the question why make a second system if the other is so optimized
@_date: 2019-02-16 09:51:30
what makes you say that
@_date: 2019-02-08 17:59:07
I mean... kinda yes.  if your fraction is anything besides 1 then it's frb

is BTC useful if access to electricity is limited

I admit you had me there in the first sentence, but then... wth!

maybe they benefit un-proportionally, but they do provide a very useful service and should be compensated for that like any other job.

remember the anticipation when Chicago started listing futures...
