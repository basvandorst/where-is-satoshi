The people that sell are selling to people with the fiat.  So coinbase has nothing to do with that problem.   If there aren’t enough people with fiat to purchase what is trying to be sold then price goes down.

Its not track race for every block.  It’s a guessing game.  For simplicity, each each miner (hardware) has the same chance of solving the block.   So the only way to mine all the blocks is if you were the only one mining.   Otherwise, your chances of solving a block is your percentage of total hashrate.

It’s vague because I don’t know those definitive numbers.  Hence, the reason it’s a question.  If I knew these answers I wouldn’t be asking the community to enlighten me.   Sounds like it is a possibility but a very unlikely one.  If price did decline drastically, hashrate would most likely fall at a smoother rate and the difficulty adjustment would adjust fast enough.  
I appreciate the replies and will try and go back to look at past discussions.

I would think the value at which mining is unprofitable for Bitmain is pretty low.  However, that would probably make them own over 51% of the hashrate which raises another problem.

I would say a major problem would be the price that causes the mining of blocks to go from 10 minutes to days.   If the price falls significantly below the cost to mine, I would think miners would stop mining.   Idk that number though.

Disagree with all the 2018 ones.  I can’t tell you what will happen by 2022.   BTC will most likely be under 6k at end of year.   When there’s blood in the streets, that’s when you buy!  I say we will see 3k.   Hope not...just my feeling.

@_date: 2018-08-14 23:12:35
The more popular bitcoin gets as an actual currency, the price will go up and there will be more transactions.  I’m not sure if the block size will remain the same or increase when the time is right.   However, it will find a balance.  Total hash rate doesn’t have to keep increasing for it to be secure.  It just has to be great enough that financially it would cost more to produce a 51% attack than you’d receive in the attack.   The network is already at a point to where it is almost impossible to do that...unless you’re manufacturing the miners yourself and have the capital.   Bitmain is really the only entity at the moment that could pull this off but there is more incentive for them to keep it secure.

It can be a little overwhelming at first so you may want to research the different options.  Basically though you’d want to make a limit order.  Set the price you’d like to buy at (has to be lower than spot price) and how much btc you want to buy.  It’ll fill if the price falls to or below your order price.    One thing to be aware of if you place a market buy or sell (besides there are fees for these) is that it’ll fill it based on the orders out there.   For instance, if you want to buy $100 worth of btc and u place a market order with current price at $6500, you may not get the get all your btc at that price because the price may go up as your market buy takes orders off the books.   My advice to you is pick a price you want to buy at whether it’s right below spot price or a lot.   Don’t set it and get nervous that it won’t fill.   Set and walk away.

There is a reason most political ads are mudslinging.  Because it’s more effective at influencing people’s opinions than vanilla facts.  No one will ever say I judge people by rumors (or claims they haven’t fact checked) I hear but research has proven otherwise.  
@_date: 2018-10-11 17:09:54
First off if the market tanks most individual people won’t move anything.  The ones that do will put it into something very low risk.   Fund managers are the ones who will actually move assets to control risk management and it won’t be into crypto cause they can’t and too risky.  Crypto markets will take a huge hit if we see a recession.  However, I do believe when the recovery starts more people look to crypto as part of their portfolio and hopefully by then we have ETFs approved.   So I do think the stock market plunging won’t directly help cryptos but will indirectly down the road.   
@_date: 2018-10-01 01:10:03

70,000,000 Th/s is the current total hashrate.

52560 blocks per year.  
Total hashrate/(your hashrate x 52560) = years to find a block.

Yes.  Satoshi said “The price of any commodity tends to gravitate toward the production cost.” 
In the case of bitcoin, the amount mined is halved so miners will be looking for double the price.

Do you know the person requesting the BTC?  They most likely are requesting it for a reason.  Most legitimate companies that transact in BTC also will accept typical payment methods unless they are doing things that are illegal.   If you’re buying something illegal, know that all bitcoin transactions are recorded forever and can be traced back to you if your address is ever associated with your name.   If it’s not something illegal, there is a good chance that the person selling it obtained it illegally.
@_date: 2018-10-03 03:19:45
I don’t use coinbase anymore but I believe they charge more than the spot price to ensure they don’t lose money in the time it takes for them to fill the order.   Same with selling only it’s always lower.  Plus they charge a fee.  Make a market order on gdax (believe its coinbase pro now) and you won’t pay any fee and will buy/sell at spot price. 
Edit:  its 0.5% above spot price if you buy and 0.5% below if you sell.  Plus whatever fee they advertise.   
@_date: 2018-10-31 01:26:45
You may be right.   However, if I said I had a friend and only told you bad things about him/her and you knew they were highly opinionated statements would you think they are a good person, bad person, or wait to decide for yourself (everyone is going to say they’ll wait to decide for themselves...lol)?   Just saying it has a subconscious affect on people over time.  It’s tough to have to seek out the facts all the time on important issues.  To call yourself “news” you should provide unbiased news but extreme opinions drives viewership.  Fuck, even the weather forecasts use extreme cases to drive ratings.   With all that sad I believe in a free market and you let people/business do what they want and let the market decide.   My only problem is there a lot of dumb people out there that just eat all this up as gospel and can’t think for themselves.    End rant.   
@_date: 2019-08-04 23:57:19
Its not a speed really.  It’s the size of the fee.   If you google mempool for bitcoin, it’ll show you the transactions currently waiting to be included in a block and their fee size.  So to ensure your transaction gets included in a block in those time ranges they suggest a fee size.  This isn’t 100% certainty because more transaction could come in with higher fees and get chosen before yours.

There is no guarantee.  It’s impossible to guarantee a time range.  One, we really don’t know when the next block will be found.  It could be 1 minute or an hour.  Two, there is no way to ensure other people don’t send transactions with higher fees than yours.  So these are just educated guesses based on the current mempool status.

A person loses all credibility when his explanation to market movements is “The whales did this...did that”.    
Yes they can raise the price, but they had to buy at those prices to raise the price.   Then they have to KNOW that they’re is enough people ready to buy to sell to higher than they bought and vice versa if they want to lower the price.   No doubt there is manipulation in this environment but it’s way more complex than your simple the whales wanted to.

Best advise is to stop even thinking about the price in terms of what you could’ve gained or lost.   If you’re in it for short term profits, given the emotional thoughts you have, just get out. You will lose.  GUARANTEED.    If you’re in it long term, absolutely don’t even think about trading.  Just buy more if it makes a big correction (only if you have more to lose).   The absolute only time I would think about selling is if it goes parabolic and everyone is talking about it going to $1,000,000.  Even then you need to have patience to not FOMO back in at a higher price.   That’s when revenge trading happens.   It’s an emotional rollercoaster watching those prices.

10 minutes times how many confirmations the exchange needs.    This is an estimate as blocks are on average mined every ten minutes but could be mined quicker or longer.   That’s assuming you have set a fee large enough to be included in the next block.   This changes by the amount of transactions in the mempool.    My advise to you is if you’re looking to sell in the near future to just put it on the exchange and that way it is already there (only use reputable exchanges).  I would not emotionally sell your bitcoin based on fear.   You should already have your mind made up on if you’re long on bitcoin or just looking to profit short term.   If you’re long then don’t even consider selling it but buy more if there are big dips.

They are either purposely circulated to “explain” the movements from big players or the masses just look for anything to explain btc movement.    If believe in bitcoin, DCA in and DCA out (if you need money or you get nervous with the price movements which means you have too much money at risk).  Do not try and trade for profit.

You don’t use coinbase to trade.  They charge a fee plus have a spread on top of the current spot price.   This is because you are actually buying and selling from them (although they probably immediately buy or sell to someone else).  You need to use coinbase pro if you’re going to trade.  There are fees there too (they list them).  There you are buying and selling from other buyers and sellers directly.

I believe you can’t rebuy within 30 calendar days.  Otherwise it’s called a wash sale and acts like you never sold it.   Not the same if you sell and have gains.  Those are immediate and doesn’t matter if you immediately rebuy.  Just another fun fact just in case you get the itch to sell. 
Edit:  as pointed out.  Cryptos are treated like property and not stocks or securities.  Thus they are not subject to the wash sale rule...for now.

Well it kinda does.  On a downward trend for hashrate the blocks take longer than 10 minutes on average for a block to be mined.  On an upward trend it takes less than 10 minutes on average.   This is the reason we are a head of schedule from the original timeline for all bitcoin to be mined.  Now this difference is probably negligible but just an FYI.  
@_date: 2019-01-01 21:59:56
Again, back to my point.  If it goes up he won’t have a loss and will then need to pay the taxes on gains he really didn’t have but on paper.  So it’s not a fuckup unless he really needed that loss to stop other financial needs he couldn’t meet.

Idk.  It’s in the public eye.  The IRS is a business just like other businesses.  Is it “profitable” to put manpower to go after that sector.   I’m sure there are some people that have profited greatly off of Warcraft gold and they either paid taxes on gains or the IRS would tax them if they were audited.   So just because they don’t proactively make sure people are paying taxes on things like that, doesn’t mean they aren’t expecting you to pay taxes on those gains and will tax you if audited.

Bitcoin transaction are visible to anyone.  All you see though is what addresses were involved in the transaction.  Not necessarily the person associated with those addresses.  It’s possible for someone to indirectly link their personal info to an address.  For instance, if someone uses an exchange and inputs all their personal information for that exchange (if required) then sends crypto to an address, that person could be linked to that address.   However, if you never use an address in a way that it could be linked to your personal information, then there is no way to know who is in control of it.

It’s all just data in bitcoins ledger.  Coins don’t really go anywhere.  You make an address and the ledger keeps track of what addresses “own” how many bitcoin.  The different types of wallets are just different ways to store your seed which is needed to send or receive bitcoin to those addresses.  
I’m sure something isn’t exactly correct with the above information but it’s good enough.  
ELI5:   The blockchain is just a bunch of locked boxes (addresses).  You need the key to open them (send or receive).   The different wallets are just a way to store your key so no one can steal it and open your box.  Soft wallet is like holding a digital key online and can be hacked in different ways because it’s online.   Hard wallet is like a digital key that is designed so the key is never really online.  Cold storage or paper wallet is like having a physical key in your pocket.

The higher the fee you pay will increase your odds at getting into a block sooner than if you paid a low fee.  At times when the mempool is clearing every block then it really won’t help unless there is suddenly an increase in transactions.  In this case a higher fee would’ve helped because you probably would’ve made it into the next block.  Where a low fee might not have been able to go into the next block because new transactions with higher fees filled the block.

The wealthy are less likely to act on fomo or fear.  They typically are diversified to make sure they will succeed regardless of the market.  The amount of financial advisors who don’t believe in bitcoin greatly outnumber the ones that do.   Thus they have no desire to even acknowledge it at all...at this point.    To them if bitcoin is to become something they’ll use it when needed and may never consider it an investment (no one should really).

It sounds very logical to have a third party who can always ensure you have what you say you have.  This way investors have no worries about the legitimacy of their claims.   You could as you said just have a 3rd party verify based on wallet addresses but there still could be some hand waving.  Like hey this is one of our addresses...but it’s not.  Maybe it’s an affiliated partner’s address but not part of the Exchange’s addresses.

It’s a guessing game.  A bunch of computers just keep guessing until one gets it.  Analogy: to solve a block you need to flip a coin and get heads 3 times in a row.   On average this takes 3 minutes.  It’s possible you could get it in 3 flips and sometimes it’d take you an hour.   The more hashrate there is, the more difficult it is to solve.  Like saying now you need 5 heads in a row.

Your credit card company will give you the money back but it will be pending coinbase’s response to the fraud.  They obviously will say they did nothing wrong and your credit company will take the money back from you.   After that coinbase will probably disable your account.

That is their lane.  When you loan someone money, you need to qualify that customer and figure out their risk.   Someone who is putting a lot of money into crypto is a higher risk.  I think it’s a risk for two reasons other than the fact it’s just a risky investment.  1) Losing your funds from being hacked or user error is a real possibility.  Think of any other investment where you just lose that asset outside of its value changing.  2) Cryptos are just getting established but their is a high risk that people aren’t paying their taxes correctly.  Uncle Sam will get his money before the bank will.   So it’s all about risk assessment and that’s their right (kinda...neglecting the fact the government lets them do fractional reserve banking which allows them to do what they’re doing anyway).

I would say yes.   It’s nothing that you’ll look back on and regret to the point where it’d have a negative impact on your life.  
With that said, use this opportunity to learn about bitcoin and why it was invented.  Learn about traditional investments and how markets works.   Prices don’t always correlate to information you’d think would drive price.  It’s a lot of speculation and herd mentality.  
The most successful investors have the ability to evaluate assets, buy when they think it’s underpriced, and sell when it’s overpriced.  The average person buys when it’s overpriced and sells when it’s underpriced.  Sounds easy but emotions are a powerful thing. 
If you take anything from this moving forward is, NEVER buy or sell (anything really...not just bitcoin) off of emotions!   Always have a plan and stick to it.   Dollar cost average!

Bitcoin is not a scam.   Bitcoin is the technology and is as advertised.  As you’ve defended yourself many times stating attacking the user is a not a valid argument.  Your whole point in calling bitcoin a scam is because some of the users can manipulate the price of bitcoin too easily and profit off of the general public.   Which is basically attacking the users of bitcoin and not bitcoin itself.   Bitcoin works exactly as the code is written.  If you think you’re going to buy bitcoin and get rich quick, then you’re a fool.   A fool and his money are soon parted.   Bitcoin has never been intended as an investment.   The product is not in question here.

No Bitcoin is Not a scam.  Again you’re attacking users of bitcoin.   Show me where Bitcoin itself does not work as intended.  No where does any of the code promise a price.   If you need bitcoin to actually use as currency, then you can buy and send and price fluctuations have little affect on you.  If you try and invest to get richer, then you’re taking a risk in a market with low liquidity and a lot of unknown influences.  The only way we would be in agreement is that Bitcoin is not a scam but the idea of promising wealth by investing in Bitcoin is.   So when you say Bitcoin is a scam you are just as bad as people saying investing in bitcoin will make you rich.
