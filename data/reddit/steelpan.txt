It was the first one that reached the mainstream media (at least in my country), IIRC.

 &gt;It can be used for remittances, smart contracts, stock issuance and ownership, and any form of asset transfer imaginable. That’s the power of the decentralized public ledger. 
Can someone please explain how stock issuance/ownership works with Bitcoin? Can buy stock in a company using Bitcoin?

Well, with "assess" I meant "evaluate or estimate the value of bitcoin" but in a more official way, by issuing quarterly reports on the performance of bitcoin for example. I didn't mean "assess" as in "set the value of"

Right, but the math is neutral. A computer is also math.  Computers didn't promote themselves, did they? Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Michael Dell, and many many more did. 


Right, so maybe we need a success story. One that gets bitcoin rid of the bad reputation bitcoin built up. Something like Subway did with the [Jared Fogle]( guy, but then with a business owner who adopted bitcoin and grew his sales by 300% (but doesn't sell drugs or anything shady).

Of course it needed leadership. Especially in the early stages. Did Tim-Berners Lee, who invented the internet, just sit there idly as the internet took off? No, he's now [director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)]( which oversees the Web's continued development. 
Does email need a marketing team? No, but do Gmail, Live, and Outlook market the service? Yes. 
Now does bitcoin need a marketing team? I think yes.

I just gilded you. I had 10 free gold creddits given to me last year because I signed up for the "best of [subreddit]" for my sub Almost nobody submitted anything, so I now have creddits that were created out of nothing and didn't cost me anything except time.

Haha, poeple. Was that on purpose too?

I think you're mistaking Ethiopia for Somalia.

I do too. In my mind Bitcoin is like pokémon, there's no different plural version.

I wonder what kinds of things are discussed in these sorts of meetings.
