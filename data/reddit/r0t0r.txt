Are people going to get their money back?
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:40:07
The price is going to go up, or it's going to go down.  If it's going to down, you don't want to own it, unless that changes.  If it's going to go up, you do want to own it, until that changes.  The price you bought it for has absolutely no relevance to the situation.  It's history, it doesn't matter.

So we agree.  Sell all your BTC.
lol, kidding.  Good luck in the next 24 hours.  We could all use it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:52:25
And the people that didn't "lock in losses" at $600 should have.
You clearly don't understand.  Don't know how else to help you.  I'd draw a picture but it's too late at night for that.  I hope you figure it out though.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:37:56
when did that get sent out?
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:50:48
Very possible.
But why do that?  Any thoughts on motive?
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:56:32
I think the whole damn thing got hacked, personally, and someone's just trolling.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:07:46
Yes, if it's going to drop more, then you should sell it.  WTF are you talking about.

Y'all are idiots.  You've lost money whether you sell or not.
As for whether or not to sell, no idea.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:40:08
I will.  If not for you, than for anyone else unfortunate enough to listen to this dumb "not a loss till you sell" advice.

Fuck you bitch.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:24:25


:D That's all I'm trying to say.  Following from that logic, neither does it matter whether you've lost or gained.  All that matters is if it's worth owning into the future.
I was never saying the guy should or shouldn't sell, I was just saying that you shouldn't avoid selling simply based on the fact that it would be a loss.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:00:10
Agreed.  I've never on Reddit seen stupid posts flooding in like they have been on in the last hour.  This must be what people do when they panic.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:57:55
It's an exchange, dummy.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:07:40
This is a brand new technology with a brand new way of banking.  Nobody knows what it's like to depend on unregulated banking.  Of course people were side swiped.  When someone's ridden their whole life with training wheels, you can't expect them not to fall the first few minutes you take them off.
The free market can handle this.
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:03:38
No.  Being responsible for that much of other peoples' money is not a joke.  You don't just wing it and lie to people when you fuck up.  He may be all sad and depressed about the situation he's put himself in.  Would have been cool if he had cared before the ceiling caved in, not after.
I didn't lose any money on Gox, I was out of there a long time ago, but I have no sympathy for him.  He's a piece of shit.

@_date: 2014-02-25 10:16:22
Right.  You think it's going up, so you should hold it (or buy it).  The opposite is true as well; if you think it's going down, you should dump it (or not buy it).  In either case, it doesn't matter what your entry price was.
What I'm talking about really has nothing to do with Bitcoin at all, it's the philosophy of trading.  The philosophy that you haven't lost anything unless you sell.  It's simply denial.  People are always thrilled about their gains when their asset climbs in price, even if that haven't sold it yet, but somehow they don't acknowledge that they've taken a loss take a loss until they sell.  It makes no sense.
It doesn't matter what price you bought it at.  It doesn't matter if it's a loss or a gain.  You act on position based on what you think the future of the asset is.  This "it's not a loss until you sell" is ignoring the future in order to make the past less painful.
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:56:38
So.... what's going to happen from here.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:33:20


Of course it can, and the reverse can happen, too.  You can go long on an asset that bankrupts.  Totally irrelevant.  Not the point at all.
Whether it's currently a loss for you or currently a gain for you is totally irrelevant.  If it's a bad time to *purchase* it, it's a bad time to *own* it.  This idea that you've haven't lost anything until you sell is ludicrous.
I'm repeating myself now, so I guess I'm not doing a good job of getting the point across.  I'll try to find a better explanation online.  Stand by.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:54:49
hahaha yea, no kidding
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:50:29
I agree, but many people have found success with momentum trading.  I wish I knew how to momentum trade (instead of swing trade), without falling into that 90%.  I haven't been successful so far.
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:43:55
what a lazy fuck you are
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:53:00
Good find.  I'm surprised nobody has pointed this out before.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:09:10


I don't.  That isn't the point.  The point is that if you happen to be very bearish on something, you shouldn't avoid selling it so you don't "lock in losses".  **You already have lost.**  All that matters now is what will happen.  The only time "locking in losses" is a concern is with taxes.  It's not a relevant concept from a pure trading/investing standpoint.
Are you being ignorant on purpose, or do you still not understand?  This is an honest question. I'm not going to waste my time if you simply just don't want to learn.
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:33:38
Wow.  Good work.  Are you a hacker?
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:55:09
Even if you *are* planning on holding long-term, if it's going to be cheaper tomorrow than it is today, it would be beneficial to sell it and buy even more tomorrow.
What I'm saying is that this idea that you haven't experienced a loss if you don't sell is fucking stupid.  It's an emotional defense mechanism.  Yes, you've lost money, whether you like it or not.  Even if you don't sell it until the price comes back, you still lost money, you just earned it back.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:52:09
Yea, I doubt it.
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:12:21
On all of those gray buttons, find the one that says "LTC/BTC".  That will buy/sell between those two currencies.  Use the chart (if you wish) to determine how much LTC you want to buy and at what price (in BTC), and put it in the "Buy LTC" box.
Ignore the chat box on the right.  Don't let anything said there have anything to do with your trading.
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:21:57
Glad they helped *you* out.  They waited almost two weeks to give me my BTC, despite e-mailing and receiving a response from support.  Meanwhile, I got to watch it tumbling, wishing I could sell it.  Thanks Oba... Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:52:12
In BTCe, go to **Finances-&gt;Funds-&gt;(next to "BTC")Deposit**.  Copy the long code that shows up at the bottom of the screen.
In coinbase,  **"Send/Request"-&gt;"Send Money"**.  Paste that code in the addresses, put the amount of BTC you want to send, and you're on your way!

I'm not a big successful trader or anything, but I tried out CampBX today (I'm a convert from Mt. Gox).  I like it.  Made several trades pretty easily.  Transferring USD is $2 per ECH transfer, in or out, or you can do check/money orders for free.  They have different order types like Fill-or-Kill, which is nice, and they intend to start doing short/margin trading soon.  Seems like a legit setup.  The fees aren't crazy (0.55%/trade).
Link: [CampBX](
Use a referral link if you sign up. You get 10% off of commissions forever (and the referrer get 10%).  If none of your friends have accounts there, the link above includes my referral.
Don't trust my opinion though, these are just my initial thoughts after using them for a day.
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:43:14
I commented on another post with information that might help you, too.  It is **[here](
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:54:29
If you're in the U.S:
There's a multitude of exchanges.  Many of them are difficult to put US dollars (USD) into.  So what you can do is use one of the exchanges that handles USD well, buy bitcoin there, and then easily transfer that bitcoin to your preferred exchange.  Below are the ones I like for purchasing with USD.  They're both really easy, they're both in the U.S., and they both support two-factor authentication.
**[COINBASE]( is popular.  The fee is 1% and it automatically buys the bitcoin at the current market price.  Transfers are done with ACH (uses routing number and account number off of your checks).  If you back-up your account with a credit card, you can transfer USD in instantly (still comes from your bank account).  Coinbase is really easy for turning USD into BTC, but it's not a platform you want to use for trading.
**[CAMPBX]( is the other.  You can just mail them a check or money order and they'll put it into your web account **for free**.  (ACH deposits coming soon.)  Then you buy/sell bitcoins at 0.55% transaction fee.  When you get rich you can then transfer back to your bank account for a flat $2 fee (ACH transfer).  CampBX is a better platform for trading than Coinbase.
With either one, **definitely** use a referral code when you sign up.  Getting a referral to Coinbase gives you and the referrer each $5 once you've made a transaction of $100.  The referral for CampBX gives you 10% off of transaction fees forever and the referrer 10% of your transaction fees.  If you have a friend with an account, ask them for their referral code.  Or, you can use my referral codes (they're built in to the links above.)
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:06:42
Just buy some.  A couple of the websites make it really easy to buy in with only a few dollars.
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:03:46
I can't comment on cryptsy, but I was talking to someone about it last night, and they like it.  Hard to get USD into it though, just like BTC-e.
Last couple of days I've been using CampBX.  If you're in the U.S., I recommend looking into them.  They're U.S. based and can do ACH transfers **to** your bank account for a flat $2 (instead of a percentage).  Soon you can do ACH transfers *from* your bank, which will be awesome.)
It seems to work well.  They have some advanced order types that are convenient (like Fill-or-Kill).  Fee is .55%/transaction.
If you decide to get an account there, definitely use a referral code.  You save 10% on exchange fees forever (and your referrer gets 10% of your fees).  If you don't have any friends with CampBX, you can use my referral link
Link:  [CampBX](
Don't your own research, though.  I do like CampBX, but I've only used it for a couple of days.
**EDIT:** Sorry.  Just saw that you're trying to buy LTC, not BTC.  CampBX could still be a good way to get USD to BTC before going to a cryto exchange.  Coinbase is 1% fee for both transfering USD from your bank, and for converting it into BTC.  CampBX will be $2 to get USD in, and .55% to put it in BTC.  Which will be cheaper depends on the amount you want to put in.
