Yeah, ironically in my experience even the poorest people in Asia have smartphones and use them for everything and here in Germany there are university students in their twenties who walk around with old flip phones.
I personally don't give a shit whether crypto can help the unbanked. There already are non blockchain alternatives for that (M-Pesa and such). I just hope that crypto can help the paranoid people here in Germany who (claim to) value their privacy above all else to arrive in the 21st century.

Exactly, crypto is not just a digital payment system. Those already exist and seeing people fantasizing about paying everything with their phone makes me cringe everytime when I think what Chinese people (I am not despite my name) would think about this. WeChat and Alipay are perfectly digital and more usable than Bitcoin will likely ever be.

I have in the past. There is a coffee place where I live that accepts Bitcoin. Unfortunately the fees have been a bit high recently to justify using it.

Wow, I didn't know that Edeka accepts BTC. That's really cool. You should add [Lieferando]( to that list.

Then go to China. WeChat and Alipay did that.

What the hell? Even if you don't want Bitcoin or believe it will be worthless at some point, you can just sell it for Dollars. Do they not know the current exchange rate? Even if it crashed to zero before the time they manage to sell it they only lose 1 Dollar.

Just the act of scanning the code and having the payment accepted felt strange and novel? That's exactly how it has worked for hundreds of millions of people in China for years now.

Isn't it ironic that you need to use more intermediaries in order to pay with a currency that was supposed to eliminate intermediaries?
