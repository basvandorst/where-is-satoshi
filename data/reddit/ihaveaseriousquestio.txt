Now taking investors! I tried to get my mom into it, she didn't really go for it. I tried though!
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:42:02
I'm sorry, I don't want any though, I don't really know how to use the coin. You should give some to your friends though, explain it to them, and get the word out.
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:01:12
Not going to happen. Hold!

If you're going to tip him/her especially to build trust I would have done more than a dollar. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:56:16
I believe you have to accept the tip within 21 days or its gone?

I've got very little experience with it myself, but I tell ya, I've never been so happy on reddit. All these people, normal people for the most part, making it! Makes me want some popcorn!
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:35:30
I just got an account! Thinking about buying my first bit coin! Should I do it?!
Glad I didn't do it Edit.

I don't know if this is a trick to increase the use of btc. It seems after record highs and all the news about millionaires popping around more people know about btc . Maybe the dip is to make btc avail at lower prices so people can see the potential in investing at a lower price. Or maybe I'm full of shit and such.

@_date: 2013-04-11 20:42:38
I agree!

now we need just one language...
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:47:47
If people hoard it , the market will crash, we needs more people to offer places to spend BTC.

Growing pains.

If this is true you'll be vindicated shortly.

Be careful! Spend some and save some, keep the market active!

Keep your head up, taking risks and learning lessons is good for future investments.
