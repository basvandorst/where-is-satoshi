Massively connected central hubs.
KYC AML
So this is how the Bitcoin vision dies... To massive applause.

When I bought the Genesis contract fees were low. It was quite some time ago.

Oh, I liked BTC a lot! I bought the Genesis contract quite some time ago, before BTC ground to a standstill, before I started being vocal against BTC. 
So I checked my BTC wallet today for the first time in months, because I want to sell. What a disaster.

Oh noooos! RED PILL!
DO NOT TAKE THE RED PILL!

The solution is to raise the blocksize. For every sucker like me who complains there are millions who don't and just won't use BTC again. Any company who treats its customers like Core does deserves to die. 
By the time LN is a thing (if ever) BTC wil be overtaken by a coin that does not screw its customers.

Sure... The problem is I cannot leave. That is the whole point: I cannot sell my BTC because of the fees. So no matter how hard I hit the door, it is stuck.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:21:57
Precisely my point. If BTC does not care about its customers it will die. Thank you for pointing it out so clearly.

It is Craig Wright buying rigs for the November Hash War.

The problem is we are not talking about Bitcoin dying here, we're talking about segwitcoin dying.

Use Dash instead of BTC. Confirmation is in 2 seconds, settlement is 2,5 minutes and fees are minute.

Which is why Craig Wright prefers that people regard him as a fraud and not the real SN.
How much is tax on a trillion USD's?
Also Blockstream can't accept him as SN, since it would destroy theit credibility regarding blocksize and segwit...

So where is LN? I don't see LN. Do you see LN?

My first segwit tx cost 20 USDs

A 110% onchain capacity increase is simply not enough. Anybody who has seen the mempool size recently knows that.
Since the block capacity is not significantly increased in relation to the mempool, fees will not come down to acceptible levels.
Segwit is not the fastest onchain scaling solution. This is simply not true. 
Segwit is not the best malleability fix, there are other simpler solutions.
Sorry, I am not convinced.

From segwit to non segwit. No. Segwit did not make it cost more. Full blocks did.

So in which jurisdiction? Ver is not a US citizen anymore.
