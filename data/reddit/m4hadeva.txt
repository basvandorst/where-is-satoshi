Thank you for actually answering the question ;) 
Okay so it is definitely unsafe to accept BTC transactions before a block confirmation.
Do you have a link to some resources about this?

Thanks! Do you know further reading on this?

Thanks. At this point I haven’t been able to use a custodial LN wallet on my device (iPhone).
Also my customers asked specifically about Bitcoin and not LN so far.

Thank you for the info. Sadly I do not own a lightning node and this seems a bit complicated. 
I will keep that in mind.

I see. Is there any alternative way? Some way to have instant and secure transactions? 
I am reading online that Bitcoin Cash does not have RBF and transactions are instant and considered secure. Is this viable?

Thank you. As mentioned above I couldn’t  find a wallet (where I actually hold my funds and not give them to a bank/third party) that supports lightning on iOS.
Is there such thing?

Thank you! Valuable info.

Thanks. This sounds overly complicated to be honest :/ 
This would require me to run my own full node etc.. which I do not really want at this point as I am just getting started with crypto

How can I differentiate those two types of transactions? 
I am using Bluewallet and Bitcoin.com wallet on my phone.

RBF does allow change of the output address (as mentioned in BitcoinCore’s documentation).
As mentioned above, it would be for use in a physical shop, so I cannot ask my customers to wait for between 1 minute to a few hours (depending on the time of block confirmation).
Could you imagine going to a store and wait for an hour in front of the cashier?

Thank you for the clarification, but my question is about RBF. I am asking the probability of successful transaction replacement, and if possible some links to some resources about the subject :)
