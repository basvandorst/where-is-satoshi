$1,100 capital gains.

You only have to report payments you made in the course of your trade or business.  Reporting is not required if the payee is a corporation, or if the payment is for merchandise.

Yes.  That really was the only open question, whether mining coins would be income when mined, or treated as manufactured inventory.  It really could have gone either way.
I suspect that the Tax Court might still agree with a miner who treated mined coins as inventory.

Let's say 2013 was your first year doing this.  If you tried to reasonably estimate your gains, the IRS would not quibble over the exact amounts.
If I were in this situation (lots of tiny transactions), I would just use a monthly price average and a little Excel spreadsheet.  Using average prices of 20, 30, 50, 100, 200, 160, 130, 100, 100, 150, 200, and 500, I can figure that I bought 207.43 bitcoins through the year, and sold 138.28, leaving 69.15 in my wallet.  I'd check that with my actual wallet to see if it's reasonably close.
Using LIFO, the coins I actually sold are deemed to be the ones I bought in Jan, Feb, and Mar, and 9.11 out of the 12.5 I bought in Apr.  Those specific coins cost me 4,661.57, so I would report short-term gains of 5,338.43.
As far as not having a centralized exchange, I wouldn't be surprised if exchanges started being regulated exactly like any other barter exchange, including 1099-B reporting requirements.

1.  Assuming you buy and sell the bitcoin on the same day, it would be reasonable to treat the bitcoin as not having changed in price.  So no capital gain or loss there.  You may have a currency gain or loss from the foreign currency transaction.
2. Value the .15 BTC at FMV at the time you spent them.  If they're worth $600, then you have spent $90.  Your taxable gain (or loss) is the difference between $90 and what you paid for the .15 BTC.  (Or the amount you included as income when you mined them.)
3.  Gambling income is normally reported on Line 21 of your 1040.  If you win 0.1 BTC, you have $60 income (assuming 600 USD/BTC).  Gambling losses are reported on Schedule A, and are limited to your gambling income.  If you lose 0.1 BTC you have a $60 deduction, but you have to report a capital gain (or loss) equal to the difference between $60 and whatever that 0.1 BTC was worth when you got it.

Currency gains (except for certain futures or forward contracts) are taxed at ordinary income tax rates, not capital gains tax rates.  So treatment as a stock or property is actually beneficial to the taxpayer.
In other words, the IRS treatment of Bitcoin as property means that you owe *less* tax than if it were recognized as a currency.

Supremacy clause + Commerce clause vs 10th Amendment.  I think the 10th loses this one.

Not true.  If you buy a car for gold, you will incur capital gain or loss.

Back in the early days of bitcoin faucet, they would give away 5 btc per day to everyone who asked.

Actually, what the USA is concerned with is "undeniable accession to wealth" (*Glenshaw Glass* 1955).  Meaning if you have more "stuff" at the end of the day than at the start, you had income and are liable for tax.

Section 1031 does apply to personal property.  The scenario you describe is actually a 1031 exchange.  The difference between real and personal property is that personal property doesn't have to go through a qualified intermediary if the exchange is simultaneous.
I think the different cryptos are similar enough to qualify for like-kind treatment, but that doesn't ease the reporting burden, as each trade would require its own 8824.

The FMV is supposed to be as of "immediately after" the spinoff.  Hopefully there will be enough depth in the market on August 1 that the FMV of each coin is readily ascertainable.  But if markets are thin, then using the FMV on, say, Feb. 1 six months later may be reasonable.

Selling for fiat is not what triggers taxation.  It is accession to wealth.  Barter is taxable in the US.  If a tax preparer does a carpenter's taxes in exchange for the carpenter doing some work on his house, both parties have income.  If "one red paperclip" had happened in the US, each trade would be taxable.

The correct stock analogy would be a "spin-off", not a split.  In a stock spin-off you allocate your basis in the original investment according to the relative FMV of the new and old shares.

To qualify for long-term, the asset has to be held for *more than* 1 year.  So wait until August 2 to sell.  It may seem like a nitpick now but I would hate for someone to sell one day too early and end up paying hundreds or thousands in unnecessary taxes.

Good point about securities, and you are probably right that cryptocoins are more similar to stocks than anything else right now.  But Notice 2014-21 has no mention of "security", and the definition in The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 does not seem to apply.  I honestly think a court could end up going either way on this, and I think an examiner/auditor would have no idea what to do.
I agree that as a practical matter, for most people just reporting USD trades is probably "good enough" but if someone makes a ton of money daytrading cryptos without converting to USD and fails to report they are setting themselves up for a bad day.

This sounds exactly right to me.
