Hi xjunda, if the app proves to be popular I will certainly make it available via Android in the near future.
Edit: I will give you a ticket towards our next raffle. Although you may not have an iOS device, you could still be in with the chance of winning. Best of luck!

Thank you CosteaReddit. 1 ticket credited to you. Best of luck!

There are no referrals, and it certainly isn't a pyramid scheme =) Hopefully the website makes it clearer to understand. Thanks for the feedback, we will let everyone know when the Android app is out!

Good question - Similarly to mining in the real world, your virtual GPUs/ASICs need to be running with a working network connection in order to mine tickets.

At the moment we manually(server-sided) credit you, but it will be automated in the next version.
These tickets can be seen on our 'Latest Submissions' table on our [website](

Thanks for the feedback Adam. As appreciation, we'll credit you with a couple of tickets for tonights draw =)

It did take time to explain how our app worked to the App Store team.
However, our app is unique in that users are entering the raffle indirectly, without purchasing tickets.
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:12:13
You need the app to generate tickets, however, I'll credit you a few tickets for our raffle on in a few hours.
Check out luckybitz.com for more info! Good luck!
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:29:37
Yes, for sure. Hopefully sooner rather than later, watch this space!
**Edit:** In the meantime, I've credited you a few tickets towards today's raffle. See our [website]( for more information and best of luck!

Without spending a penny on the app, you can generate tickets in roughly 5-10 minutes. This time will decrease proportionally to any increases in GH/s.
The "Tap screen to share" feature may not work on larger devices (iPads), which I believe you have, but there will be an update soon to resolve this. Best of luck!
@_date: 2015-01-09 08:57:50
I would be very surprised if that was the case!
@_date: 2015-01-08 18:24:56
Nice to hear, thanks =)
@_date: 2015-01-08 18:27:19
Sorry to hear =( What kind of error did you get? Scanning your QR code?  
Here's a couple of tickets towards today's raffle to compensate for this confusion! Best of luck!

This will be automated in the next version - for now, we are manually crediting tickets. See the tickets you've received - [luckybitz.com](
