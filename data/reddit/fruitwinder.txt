I would consider myself to have an average understanding of how Bitcoin works, but I've got to say reading through those comments made me cringe.
Well done for trying though OP, even though the people you encountered are clueless about several things.

The best way is offline paper wallets if you're really concerned about security. USB wallets are good, however what if you lose it? Or it gets damaged? At least with a paper wallet you can note down the private key in several places and, providing you're not an idiot, have a high level of assurity that your BTC is safe.

Problem solved, it looks like they hacked my Dropbox, which has the paper backup of my account, then used that to log in. I've just checked the logs on backup and I've got one logging in from Mexico. Thanks for your help.
@_date: 2014-01-31 13:00:23
The last time I was logged in was 33 hours prior to them logging in.
@_date: 2014-01-31 13:23:12
Here's a screenshot of all the logs I have, I've had to remove my IP just to be on the safe side. But that's everything that is on my account.

GPU mining is next to useless these days as difficulty is just far too high for a GPU mining rig. If you really want to do mining then to make any decent money from it then you would have to use an ASIC chip based miner, however it's not worth buying one now. My suggestion would be to use any money that you were going to use to buy mining equipment to buy Bitcoins from an exchange.
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:07:52
The best time to buy is now, and then forget about it for 6 months or a year. Don't be the guy who panic sells when the price decreases slightly.
@_date: 2014-07-24 15:51:52
Password protect your wallet, and if there is any significant amount which you cannot live without then put it into an offline paper wallet - will always be the safest way.
I lost about 0.1 BTC about 6 months ago with a flaw in the Blockchain Dropbox backup and due to me not enabling a secondary password on my wallet. You're just going to have to suck it up for now I'm afraid and take it as a somewhat expensive lesson.

Creating a link for you now.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:00:40
Not sure if it would work but you could try recovering your wallet?
@_date: 2014-02-01 11:11:14
No, I only lost a little over 0.1 bitcoins (all that I had in the account). I have no idea what I'd be doing if I was in your position.
@_date: 2014-02-11 09:05:48
No, from what I can make out they've only sent it out to 2999 addresses.
@_date: 2014-03-21 22:07:44
If you're having to ask whether something is safe or not then don't do it. Transfer your funds into something which you have primary control over, ideally a cold storage, that way you can be sure of it being safe and trustworthy.

Mining requires internet connection, it's how your miner talks to the pool to verify your accepted shares. If you have no internet connection your mining is for nothing, afterall, Bitcoin is the "currency of the internet".

My phone is iPhone. I've done a trace on their IP and they logged in (assuming that they're not using a proxy) from Illinois, USA. I live in the UK.
@_date: 2014-01-31 13:28:46


@_date: 2014-01-31 13:49:29
Thank you for your help. I do have 1BTC in cold storage on a paper wallet so it's not a massive blow to me. And hey life goes on!
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:23:42
This isn't an economic trend, this decrease is due to MTGOX having issues with it's withdrawal system and therefore they're fixing it - hence the price is going down as MTGOX is one of the biggest BTC exchanges in the world.
Instead of being a "I told you so...", why not tell people that now is the time to buy?
@_date: 2014-01-31 13:52:42
Already done, I've also changed the password.

You could set up a blockchain account and bind her phone number to it. When the payment is received she would receive a text of confirmation.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:57:47
If, like myself, you earned that through mining, then congratulations. But your work isn't done.
Send that BTC into cold storage, split it up into several amounts if you like but make sure that your BTC is not in a wallet that has ever had access to the internet otherwise all of your waiting and mining will have been for nothing!
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:11:33
How can they allow withdrawals when they're repairing the feature at the moment?


@_date: 2014-03-15 16:35:26
I agree, too many people are looking to make a quick buck. If things all go well those people shouldn't need to ever cash-in on their BTC as BTC will be regarded as highly as any other form of currency.
@_date: 2014-01-31 12:50:53
Yeah, I'm not holding much hope. It'd just be nice to get it back if it was at all possible.
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:21:15
Would you rather that they left the issue in place and then you or someone else loses BTC due to errors? Then you would be blaming MTGox for stealing your BTC.

@_date: 2014-01-31 13:35:47
I think you're being overly paranoid. I've just got the the root cause of how I got hacked. I had my wallet being backed up to my Dropbox. My Dropbox was compromised and therefore the hacker had access to my wallet. Then they transferred the coins out.
@_date: 2014-03-12 05:43:02
Why would you store the coins in something which has a single point of failure? If the iPad died, all the bitcoins would be lost. I know BTC can't be stored on an Apple device but I'm just using it as an example.
If you're really struggling then set up a wallet with Block chain and just have the QR code for the public address visible, alternatively set up a cold storage paper wallet, create a QR code and do it that way. Don't leave the coins on anything which has a single point of failure, if you set up a wallet on your PC at home, for the love of God, back up the private key.
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:12:48


@_date: 2014-02-01 09:17:16
Check your Dropbox login activity friend. The exact same thing happened to me yesterday. In any case I'm going to get in contact with Blockchain and see if there is anything that they can do because their backup scheme is clearly flawed.
@_date: 2014-01-31 12:48:37
It's not linked to any other devices. I only ever access through the web interface on a server, with automatic logout after 10 minutes. So it would have sent another request for authentication before allowing you to log in.
@_date: 2014-01-31 13:31:15


@_date: 2014-01-31 13:00:52
No, it's just a standard SMS message which is sent to my mobile phone number.
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:02:07
It's not up for debate, they're working on it but they need to turn of withdrawals to fix to problem efficiently.


@_date: 2014-02-11 09:03:34
I know this doesn't really help you, not at all in fact. But people should not be using exchanges as a way of storing Bitcoins, especially huge amounts such as what you've done. If you browse through the Bitcoin reddit, countless times have I seen people storing their entire amount of bitcoins on an exchange. 
I know that MtGox has dropped the bollock, figuratively speaking, on their own here but exchanges were never designed to be used for storing Bitcoins. They do exactly what they say, exchange.
Good luck OP, hopefully MtGox will fix their 'issue' and release your funds. At which point I would highly recommend storing any Bitcoins you aren't using right now into a cold storage paper wallet.
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:32:23
Humble Bundle have already enabled people to buy games via Bitcoin, so it can be done.
@_date: 2014-01-31 13:09:13
That's exactly what I'm thinking. Even if they had access to my browser, they still require the 2FA. It's confused me as well, I was almost certain that I had a compromised computer until I checked the logs. No problem, thanks for your endeavors anyway! 
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:05:27
Appreciated. Any recommendations of hardware wallets I could look at?
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:51:59
How so? I've not really looked much into hardware wallets but have used offline paper wallets in the past. Care to explain? I'm not saying you're wrong, just genuinely curious.

Make sure to HODL the tip!
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:44:46
$2000 for 1400 MH/s is ridiculous. You'lll **NEVER** see a ROI. I've got a 5GH/s miner running 24/7 at my place of work in a datacentre with 1Gbps internet speed and free power (perk of the job), luckily I bought it early enough that the difficulty was low I was making 0.1 BTC every 4 to 5 days. Now I'm lucky to get 0.005 per 24 hours (BTC Guild pool).
I'm just going to leave it constantly running seeing as I don't have to pay for it, and it's already paid for itself so anything that it makes is a bonus.
I'd suggest to you on actually buying bitcoins when the price drops (such as now) as to be honest, as you need to really invest in a high powered miner to make any profit from mining now as the difficulty is just too high.
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:52:10
I'll give you $100 for it. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:18:26
Personally I don't think someone who's not tech savvy would go about creating their own private keys. When I didn't know much about how the whole system worked I used Blockchain.info to store my coins. They create it for you and give you a long mnemonic to remember if you forget your passwords. So I think people would be more likely to go through websites such as those, and then read more into it and set up their own private keys; which is exactly what I did.
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:24:27
It depends how you store your private keys. If you created the private keys offline and used a brain wallet with 100 characters, it would be extremely unlikely that they would ever get access to your private keys. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:45:05
You're not more likely to find a block by having more people.
Theoretically, yes, you should be more likely but it's just rolling dice. It's really whoever gets to it first.
If you're talking about 1400 GH/s and not 1400MH/s because I'd be extremely surprised if you could find that sort of hashrate for that price. Also, buy on eBay and not direct from manufacturers because by the time you have the rig the difficulty will have increased and it's too late.

DM focus on how it's being used for things such as Silk Road and how women are using it obtain money for taking their clothes off, but that makes it no different to any other currency that has ever existed; all except you get more money now when you take your clothes off.

Use a cold paper wallet instead.
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:52:25
Seems OK, but how secure is the actual process of creating a paper wallet? How do I go about retrieving my coins from the private key if I ever want to sell my bitcoins? Also, how do I check the balance of my key once I transfer coins to it? Sorry if I'm being a noob I've just never used paper wallets before, I've always done it where I am able to see my balance and fairly easily send and receive coins.

I predict that Bitcoin Black Friday will bring about $1500, but only if people actually spend their bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:56:27
Leave it running and wait, all depends on the luck of the pool you're mining with. It also depends on your hash rate, if you're GPU mining then it's unlikely that you'll make much over the course of 24 hours.
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:45:35
Currently sitting at $973.90.
If it doesn't hit $1000 today then I'm very positive that Bitcoin Black Friday will cause it to tip over the edge.

It will never become easier to mine. The difficulty is always increasing.
