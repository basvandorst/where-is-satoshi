Neither does a strongly encrypted digital wallet used for cold storage then.
Both paper and digital wallets would be vulnerable to social engineering but you've have to be the biggest moron on the planet to fall for such a thing.
A strongly encrypted digital wallet isn't vulnerable to hacking, cracking or malware. You could give that wallet to a cracker and wouldn't gain access to the bitcoins within. That's the point of using strong encryption.
Both paper and digital wallets are vulnerable to keyloggers but at that point it's too late for the attackers to do anything about it as all the coins will have been transferred out before they even learn of your password. That's how you use cold storage.
So no, in reality a strongly encrypted digital wallet used for cold storage isn't vulnerable to any of those things. A hot wallet might be but paper wallets can't be hot wallets so if your replacing a paper wallet with a digital wallet, it's obviously for cold storage reasons.

Because we're talking about using a normal wallet instead of a paper wallet to perform the functions the paper wallet was performing.


Are you saying that if you enter your BIP38 password on a machine that has a keylogger, that keylogger will not be able to log the BIP38 password? That's obviously nonsense so I'll assume you meant a clean, offline computer. Any file can be decrypted on a clean offline computer without a keylogger logging the password because the keylogger does not exist.

Well, I don't consider that to be voluntary and neither do millions of other people. You've probably heard of us, we call ourselves communists. We claim the worker is forced to sell their labour in order to survive.
Why are some people poor in their 40s? Because the capitalist system exploits them by taking the product of their labour and giving them a fraction of the value. Why else do you think the inequality gap is getting ever wider? Because workers are just lazy? No, it's because the capitalist system we have is designed to funnel wealth to non-working capitalists at the expense of workers.

Your method is flawed. It assumes a static network hash rate. If you look at the [actual data for past year]( you'll see that 1,612,800 BTC was actually mined. That's 22.66% more than your equation gave. In order to be able to calculate the amount of BTC mined in the next year you need to be able to predict the amount of hashing power coming online every 2016 blocks for the rest of the year. You also need to take into account the block reward for each block. It's basically a fools errand.
Bitcoin has it's own timing system. The block, 2016 blocks (difficulty retarget) and 210,000 blocks (block reward halving).

Obviously. I don't understand your point though. ASIC manufacturers selling bitcoins would increase supply and without a similar increase in demand, price would fall.
ASIC manufactures wouldn't just simply flood the market though, crashing the price, they'd release their coins in batches, allowing the price to rise slightly between releases.
Edit: I just saw a $500,000 sale followed by a $1,000,000 sale, followed by another $500,000 sale and the price barely even moved. In fact, it's now back to what it was before those sales and less than 10 minutes has passed.

You can already simply ignore bitcoin and go and use some alt-coin with some tiny hash rate if you really want to. There's a reason people don't do that though and it's the same reason why people won't be ignoring ASIC miners.


No they don't. All those users can do is refuse to relay data if they're actually a node. On the other hand, without the miners, there can be no transactions at all and no data worth relaying. It's clearly obvious that the miners have the power and control in the bitcoin network.

Milli is a prefix which means a thousandth and micro is a prefix which means a millionth. A bitcoin is the current globally recognized and accepted unit. Anyone who denies this is simply delusional. A millibitcoin is quite obviously a thousandth of a bitcoin and a microbitcoin is quite obviously a millionth of a bitcoin. 
Bitcoins, millibitcoins, microbitcoins and Satoshis are the globally recognised and accepted units of currency in the Bitcoin protocol and have been using since the beginning. People are too lazy to say millibitcoins and microbitcoins so they shorten them to millibits and microbits. *You* don't have to like that, but it's a fact regardless of your opinion.
Given the above, then logically, 1 bit = 1 bitcoin, which should be obvious because bit is simply short for bitcoin as it's currently used. Some people want to change that so 1 bit = 1 microbit.

When selling bitcoins you need the BTC in your LBC account and the amount you're selling gets taken out of your account and put into escrow automatically. A buyer picks your ad, sends you the fiat by the method you requested and marks the payment as complete. When the seller gets the payment, they mark the transaction as complete and the BTC is released to the buyer's account.
It just doesn't work the way you are describing.

What you are calling democracy is representative democracy. In a real democracy, a.k.a direct democracy, there is no need to elect representatives at all, you don't vote for people, you vote for a policy you want to see implemented. 
Many people confuse direct democracy with 51% majority rule, which it isn't. That's just a specific type of voting mechanism which could be used in a direct democracy as is 100% consensus. The most important thing about direct democracy is not even voting but being able to take part in the discussions which lead to the ideas to be voted on.
A blockchain alone is not enough to provide direct democracy but is great for recording and tallying votes. You need something like reddit as well in order for the discussion to take place.

You're missing the point about accessibility. It's not about receiving, it's about when it comes time to spend. Let's say you'd been buying and saving bitcoins for a year and some emergency pops up requiring you to sell some bitcoins. Let's say this emergency happens while you're on holiday in a different country. How do you get your bitcoins out of the paper wallet that's stored in a safe location? With a digital wallet, you could just access a copy stored on the Internet instantly or with a HD wallet just recreate it.
The point I'm making is that paper wallets offer no advantages to a strongly encrypted digital wallet used for cold storage. In fact they have a few disadvantages such as accessibility and change address errors (which lots of people aren't aware of).
It seems to me that most people don't realise that digital wallets can be used just to receive bitcoins, therefore they don't need to use their password. Nor do they seem to realise that encrypted digital wallets can be created on a clean offline computer. They just hear that they need to use a paper wallet, so that's what they use.

There's nothing future proof about this silly idea. It's just creating unnecessary confusion. Instead of people saying millibitcoins, microbitcoins, or nanobitcoins, people simply say millibits, microbits and nanobits. No amount of voting is going to change this, it's just how people use language.
Now, if some people are using "bit" to mean 1/1,000,000 of a bitcoin while others are using "bit" as shorthand for bitcoin, does 100 millibits refer to 0.1 BTC or does it refer to 0.0000001 BTC? You'd have to figure this out based on the context.
That's why this idea is idiotic and why I won't be adopting it. Those who do adopt it are just spreading confusion because they lack common sense. If you want to give 1/1,000,000 of a bitcoin a name, then anything but bits or Satoshis will do.

That wasn't the case at all. AM had 60 Ph/s worth of chips to sell and they didn't sell as many chips as they expected. They also designed an open source miner and are now selling them as well and are into batch 3. At the same time they started using the new chips to self-mine with.
None of that means that they "got so few orders they were forced to consume their own product or declare bankruptcy". That's a ridiculous statement considering they had 100,000 USD and 1,000,000 RMB in cash on the May 27th [balance sheet]( with total assets worth 19.73 BTC, 8,764,786.70 USD and 3,862,089.14 RMB. On the [cash flow sheet]( from May 27th you can see that chip sales brought in 513.70 BTC, 3,691,731.36 USD and 2,880,000.00 RMB.
The price of BTC on May 27th was around 580 USD/BTC and the USD/RMB exchange rate was 0.16 USD/RMB. [Friedcat said that the average price of chips sold was 0.5 USD per Gh/s]( 
580 USD/BTC * 513.70 BTC = 297,946 USD.  
0.16 USD/RMB * 2,880,000.00 RMB = 460,800 USD.  
297,946 USD + 460,800 USD + 3,691,731.36 USD = 4,450,477.36 USD.  
4,450,477.36 / 0.5 = 8,900,954.72 Gh/s = 8.9 Ph/s.  
At 10 Gh/s per chip, that's 890,095 chips sold which is enough to make 9,271 Tubes.
AM's "so few orders" is probably more than Spondo's or Bitmain's total orders.

Of course they do. Let's say the devs make some changes to the protocol which stops ASIC miners from functioning. Will those people using ASIC miners, update their software? Of course they won't as it would destroy their ability to mine, therefore, they would continue to use the old version of the software which allows them to mine.
Now, given that the vast majority of the network hash rate comes from ASIC miners, the bitcoin network would continue to function using the older protocol instead of the new one. If mining pools tried to switch to the new protocol, most of the miners would leave the pool to find or create one based on the old protocol.

To trade paper wallets securely, you need to verify that the address actually has the specified amount of bitcoins. You also need to transfer the coins to a new address to ensure that the previous owner can't transfer the bitcoins back to themselves. Both activities require a device with an internet connection. It's simpler and quicker to just transfer the bitcoins using electronic wallets since you'd need the equipment anyway.

A strongly encrypted wallet publicly published and well seeded on bittorrent would be better than a paper wallet. Paper wallets are way over-rated.
1. Create wallet using clean computer.
2. Strongly encrypt wallet.
3. Store it all over the Internet.
The original purpose of paper wallets was in case people lost their keys. When pointed out that paper wallets are easily destroyed or the keys can be easily stolen just by taking a photo, the usual response is BIP38 encryption and storing it a fireproof/waterproof safe, nullifying the original purpose for such wallets.
So, now you have an encrypted paper wallet stored in a safe, or in a few safe at different locations. Now you can't access those wallets whenever you want because you need to physically be at a specific place to do so.
In the case of the strongly encrypted wallet, you pretty much always have instant access to it in case of emergencies.

Digital wallets can quite easily be used for cold storage.

How would the risk of malware be higher though for the digital wallet? Malware would clearly pose the exact same threat in both instances, which would be having the password stolen.

Actually, they're not. Plenty of bitcoins users are not part of the network. In order to be considered part of the network you need to run the right software.

It sounds like you've misunderstood what I was talking about and seem to think I'm talking about using hot wallets for cold storage as well. That's not the case. I'm talking about using a digital wallet solely for cold storage instead of a paper wallet.


Why, because you say so? That's not a very convincing argument. You've provided no reason why anyone should believe you. Period.


That's 5 minutes more than than it would have taken if you wasn't using a paper wallet. Also, how long did it take you to create your paper wallet?


There's no difference in using a paper wallet or a strongly encrypted digital wallet in this regard. Malware can't brute force the encryption, the only thing it would be vulnerable to is key logging. Since were talking about cold storage, you won't be using the wallet until it's time to transfer all the coins out anyway, so you won't be entering any key to be logged. A BIP38 paper wallet is vulnerable in the exact same way. The key could be logged at the time of use but it would be too late at that point to do anything with.


Sure you might get malware on your computer. Malware can't do fuck all to  a strongly encrypted digital cold wallet except corrupt it which is completely irrelevant when you have multiple backups scattered all over the globe which are instantly accessible.




How exactly can your room mate steal bitcoins from your strongly encrypted cold storage wallet? You could hand that wallet to the best cracker on the planet, show him the 1,000,000 bitcoins in it and tell him he can keep them if he can take them. That wallet would still remain secure.


Yeah, the government can come and seize all your computers and devices but they obviously can't take a piece of paper. As for the malware, that's already been addressed.


I'm not telling them wrong things at all, you and all the rest of the paper wallet brigade are and the dad in the original post nearly lost all his bitcoins because of that.


That's not a fact at all, that's complete nonsense. A regular user can use a secure password just as easily as the worlds greatest security expert.


I am right. There's nothing pseudo-secure about strong encryption. If you think that, then you shouldn't be using bitcoins at all. For obvious reasons. Please explain how a strongly encrypted cold storage wallet can be hacked while a paper wallet can't.

Bitcoin transactions can be completely anonymous.
If you mined bitcoins, the only thing linking those bitcoins to a specific person is an IP address. With that information, it could be possible to extract your identity from the ISP. Perhaps you were using your neighbours wifi or a modded cable modem which would mean that the IP address wouldn't be linked to you.
If you now send those bitcoins to some bitcoin address using the same connection as before, how is that transaction not anonymous?

No it doesn't and it doesn't fit the definition of socialism perfectly either. That's why I said "socialist principles" and "socialist in nature" because it does incorporate those aspects.


That may not be relevant to you, but it's at the very heart of socialism. To claim otherwise is just silly.


No it doesn't but wage labour *is* a major feature of capitalism. Rewarding workers with a share of the profits proportional to the amount and type of wok they do is not. That's most definitely a socialist ideology.

Securing the blockchain involves the processing of all the transactions. Without miners, the blockchain is useless. What users want is irrelevant, the only thing that matters is what miners want because they are the ones who control the network through their choice of software/pool.
Going from 200 Ph/s to 200 Gh/s then slowly trying to build up the hash rate again over 2 years is anything but a seamless transition. Like I asked, why should miners mine on the new bitcoin network as opposed to some different coin given that Bitcoin's advantage has just been nullified?

There are plenty of legitimate "cloud mining" services available. Even ASICminer have just released AMHash - 1Gh/s mining contracts. It's starting to cost too much for the manufacturers to ship the miners.
There is nothing inherently scammy about these "cloud mining" services. That does not mean you wil make any profit from them though, just like you are not guaranteed to make any profit from mining in your home.
Also, you don't need shit loads of hashing power to make a profit from mining. What you actually need are low purchase cost for the miner, good power efficiency for the miner and cheap electricity.
For example, miner A has 100 Ph/s which cost 1 $/Gh, has a power efficiency of 0.5 J/Gh and pays 0.05 $/kWh for electricity. Miner B has 1Th/s which also cost 1 $/Gh, has a power efficiency of 0.5 J/Gh and pays 0.05 $/kWh for electricity. Both miners make the same percentage of profit or loss

What you and a lot of people don't seem to understand is that government != State.
A State is an elite group in charge of governing a society. They perform the action of government. It's States which are oppressive, not government because government isn't a group, it's an action.
It's quite possible to have a Stateless government such as direct democracy over the Internet where every single person has equal political power. Now, before anyone starts wailing about majority rules, know that that's not what direct democracy is, that's just one form of voting. Another form of voting is 100% consensus. Direct democracy includes both and everything in between. The most important thing about direct democracy though is not the vote, it's being able to take part in creating the ideas to be voted on in.

It's far more difficult and time consuming to create the paper wallet. You don't need to be connected to the Internet to install or run the client, you only need to be connected to download the block chain and do transactions. 
It's basically a case of installing the client, running it, creating a password, closing the client, then uploading the wallet. Some people may add a second layer of encryption before uploading.
Another alternative would be to use a deterministic wallet. They can be recreated from the passphrase.

You don't need to go online to create a wallet at all though. That's the part you guys don't seem to understand.

Yeah, this is what I always tell people when they ask about buying bitcoins in the UK. Localbitcoins is by far the quickest and most convenient option unless you're planning on day-trading as Localbitcoins isn't really a good platform for such activities. You can just pick someone to buy from, do a direct bank transfer (usually takes between 0 and a few minutes with faster payments) and the bitcoins get released to you from escrow. There's lots of other payment methods too but I haven't used them.
Buying from an exchange can mean sending in ID, transferring funds to the exchange, waiting for approval and funds to clear and then finally buying the bitcoins. It's a process which can sometimes take weeks for new buyers.
It's good to see Localbitcoins getting more use as it's likely to be regular people buying as opposed to day-traders which points to increasing popularity amongst the general population.

By nationalised, I mean that the main infrastructure should be created and maintained by the government, just like roads, etc.


By selling access to ISPs and using taxes (such as the $200 billion given to cable companies to improve services).


Any company that paid for access would be able to provide internet services to homes and businesses.


I don't know. I don't have the necessary info to make such calculations.
It would be far better to have the government spend tax-payers money on actually improving infrastructure though instead of giving that money ($200 billion) to cable companies that just lie about improving infrastructure. I also think it would be far better if no private corporations had a monopoly on providing Internet services.
You talk about removing artificial barriers but some of those barriers are not artificial. Should anyone who wants to set up service be able to dig up the roads, etc to lay their own cables whenever they feel like? Could they even afford to if they were allowed? This is why the monopolies exist, because it simply makes more sense. The problem is that it's private corporations who have those monopolies. Having that infrastructure controlled by the government instead solves that problem and opens up the infrastructure to everyone.

The best solutions don't come from one person telling everyone else that this is the best solution, they come from collaboration and debate.

It's an idiotic proposal which will lead to the value of 100 millibits having a value of 0.1 BTC or 10 Satoshis depending on who you are talking to.

A "government" is simply a group that governs society. It takes it's name from the action it performs - governance of society. This iaction is not restricted to people, for example, the laws of physics govern how matter interacts, how planets orbit their stars, etc.
Governments have always been centralised because it wasn't previously possible to decentralise them properly but that changed with the introduction of the Internet. It's now possible to have decentralised government in the form of direct democracy over the Internet, giving everyone equal political power.
Anarchists say that we should have no government, but that's nonsense. Without some form of government (as in the action of governance), there can be no society. What anarchists actually mean is that the people should self-govern yet what they fail to understand is that is simply direct democracy. Another thing they fail to understand is that the State is simply the apparatus of government - the bureaucracy which serves the political elite who currently serve the will of the capitalist class.
The only way to stop the State from serving the minority is to make everyone a member of the Government with equal political power through distributed direct democracy over the Internet. From that point on the State itself will begin to decentralise due to greater local governance and technological advances.

The reasons you provided do nothing to show that the new protocol would not face the exact same problems as new coins. You even state that it could take up to two years for new ASICs to be made and get mining on the new protocol. In other words, you are restarting Bitcoin from scratch again and hoping that ASIC miners join the new network once mining on the old network becomes unprofitable for them. In the mean time, given the vast number of cryptocurrencies out there (some of which are technically better than bitcoin), what makes you think miners would switch to the new bitcoin protocol as opposed to another cryptocurrency?

Socialism is not about to go the way of the typewriter at all. Socialism is getting closer to actually being implemented thanks to capitalism building up the infrastructure necessary for a socialist society.
Socialism is worker control of the means of production. As automation increases, unemployment will also increase. What do you think will happen when 50% of society is unemployed and the State can't afford the welfare bill? Do you think the unemployed will just lie down and die?
Until automation makes employment unnecessary, worker control of the means of production is the best course of action society can take. Instead of a bunch of non-working owners taking all the profit and paying the workers the lowest wage they can get away with, all the profit will get distributed to the actual workers in a unequal manner, proportional to the type and amount of work done. Because the workers would be receiving a greater income, they could afford to work less hours, meaning more people could be employed.

I'm not sure, but it would make sense. AM alone plans on putting out between 400 and 1600 PH/s worth of gen 3 chips, so miners will need a hell of a lot of hashing power to make mining worthwhile and that's going to cost a lot of money. In order for those miners to be profitable, BTC/USD value would have to increase significantly.
Edit: The previous rise to $1000+ corresponded pretty well with KnC releasing miners and the rise to $200+ before that corresponded pretty well with the initial release of ASICs from AM and Avalon.

The strongly encrypted wallet wouldn't be vulnerable at all while simply being stored on a malware infected computer. It wouldn't even be vulnerable if you specifically gave it to someone who's sole intention was to break the encryption on the wallet. The worst that could happen is the wallet gets corrupted, hence the importance of backups.
It's only vulnerable if the password is compromised and that would require you to spend some bitcoins while having an active key logger running at the time.

People just assume that direct democracy means majority rules because that's what the capitalist propaganda says it is to scare people away from it. Once the idea starts to be discussed they learn that direct democracy is not simply majority rules like they were misled into believing. The most important part of direct democracy isn't voting though, it's being able to take part in the discussions that lead to the ideas being voted on.
A constitution written by the wealthy for the wealthy does no favours for the poor. What you get is nonsense like black peoples votes being worth 3/5 that of a white man and corporations being people.
All current government systems are completely outdated. They're centuries old and no longer fit for purpose. We need to start again from scratch.

You're ignoring the fact that most miners have invested in and use ASIC miners.

The BTC gets converted to fiat automatically for a small fee by Bitcoin payment processors. How many times do you need to be told that before it sinks into that retarded brain of yours?
If the landlord is passing that fee on to the renter then why would the landlord care? They just get the exact same in fiat as they would have got if the renter wanted to pay in fiat.

Technological progress is not something that can be halted or reversed, it marches forward with time. It's not even unique to humans, other animals are technologically progressing by using tools. The only way you can stop a species from advancing technology is to eradicate that species.
Advances in technology cause corresponding changes in society, culture, politics and economics. We just don't recognise these changes because they're gradual, but if you look at the word today compared to 30 years ago, compared to 100 years ago, they're blatantly obvious.
In the capitalist stage, the capitalists are the ruling elite and the rewards are not distributed equally, the rewards mostly go to capitalists at the expense of workers. This is what you see happening now. Why is capitalism producing stuff like driverless vehicles, robotic workers and AI? All these things will significantly increase unemployment and once unemployment levels become high enough you get riots. If the issues are not addressed you get revolution. So why are capitalists making these advances? The answer is quite simple. Short term profit because there is no long term for them. They know this because they're not stupid.
In the socialist stage, there is no ruling elite, socialism begins with direct democracy. The rewards are distributed fairly to the workers in proportion to the amount and type of work they contribute. Those who can't work will get a basic income and society as a whole benefits instead of a few elite capitalists. Basically, workers become the shareholders and society is governed through direct democracy over the Internet.
In the communist stage, people no longer need to work because people no longer exist. They've uploaded their minds to become digital immortals and are busy exploring the universe in their spaceship avatars. Their consciousness exists within a virtual reality in which they are basically omnipotent. They  can transfer their minds to avatars of any form they desire, they can copy their minds to make clones, fork themselves, network with other minds, etc.

You're assuming that all miners want to sell their bitcoins which is also demonstrably false. Lots of people who use bitcoin expect to never have to need to sell their bitcoins because they can spend them directly, that includes miners. 
The fact is, hash rate does not follow price nor does price follow hash rate. If you need proof of this, the exchange rate was around 1200 USD/BTC at the beginning of December 2013 and the network hash rate was about 1.35 Ph/s. If hash rate follows price and the price is now around 500 USD/BTC then the hash rate should be around 562.5 Th/s. If price follows hash rate and the hash rate is now around 200 Ph/s then the price should be around 178,000 USD/BTC.
Obviously, neither case is true.

Not all cloud mining services are scams. Some of the ASIC manufacturers also sell cloud mining - ASICMiner's AMHash, Bitmain's Hashnest and KNC's KNC Cloud. There's also CEX.io who are pretty reputable too. Whether those services are profitable or not you'll have to figure out for yourself but they're clearly not scams. BitFury and Spondoolies also think cloud mining is the future so expect a massive uptake in cloud mining next year.
As for mining from home, whether it is profitable or not pretty much depends on how much you pay for electricity. If you pay more than 0.01 USD/kWh then you'd be better off buying AMHash contracts (which seem to be the cheapest contracts out of the above listed services).

I'm not changing my tune at all. My comments are all perfectly consistent with my initial reply to you - that a strongly encrypted wallet is better than a paper wallet.

In fact, it's probably more secure because cracking the safe would be far easier than cracking the strong encryption.
It's simply a myth that paper wallets are more secure. That myth is based on a comparison between a long term storage paper wallet created in a clean, secure environment and a normal wallet created in an insecure, malware infested environment for the purpose of everyday use. That's comparing apples to kangaroos. If you do an honest apple to apple comparison, there are no benefits to using a paper wallet so why bother with the extra hassle?

It depends on how you are using the wallet. Keyloggers can only log passwords that you enter. You only need to enter a password to *send* coins from a wallet. So, if you are using the wallet for long term storage, strongly encrypted wallets stored online are no less secure than encrypted paper wallets. Both are vulnerable to keylogging but that is negated by the fact that the coins will be transferred to a new wallet as soon as the password is entered.
Storing the wallet online in multiple places has the benefit of making your wallet accessible to you at all times.

Various ways. Take a vending machine for example. It could generatemoney by selling its stock, then use that money to order a refill when it's running low on stock. 
How would it get money to buy stock in the first place? It would ask a bunch of people for a loan, then pick the best deal.

Cloud mining is no more a scam than mining with your own hardware. Most ASIC manufacturers now offer cloud mining themselves and for most people it works out cheaper than buying and running a physical miner.
If you want a physical miner, you've got to pay for PSUs, shipping costs, import fees, taxes and electricity/maintenance costs. Buying cloud mining, the upfront costs *and* the maintenance fees are lower.

Why would cex.io buy new hardware with their own money and then give it to their customers who paid for X for Y and got exactly what they paid for? If they decide to buy new miners for their cloud mining service, they will offer new contracts based on the cost of those new miners. They won't be upgrading people out of their own pockets that's for sure.
Basically, cex.io contracts are reaching the end of their life cycle. You may as well be asking why GPU mining is no longer profitable. The answer is the same.

How I expect it to behave is completely irrelevant to how it was designed to behave and how it was designed to behave may not be the same as how it actually behaves.
The claim specifically said that bitcoin was designed to use speculation early on. Where's the evidence to back up such a claim? I'm not looking for your opinion, your opinion is irrelevant. I'm looking for a link to a post by Satoshi or one of the newer devs backing up such a claim.
The reason I ask for proof is because I have common sense and don't just believe stuff I read on the Internet because it was posted by someone "famous".

The manufacturers also provide cloud mining services and some of them have maintenance fees that are cheaper than most peoples electricity or hosting companies fees. There's Hashnest, AMHash, KNC Cloud and Bit-x. *They* get the cheapest hardware and they know how much that hardware actually costs. They *don't* know how many bitcoins that hardware will mine though. So, they charge enough to cover costs and guarantee a profit for themselves while passing the mining risk on to the customer in the exact same way they do when selling physical miners.
Like I've said elsewhere, cloud mining is just another way for ASIC manufacturers to sell hashing power and can actually be more profitable for customers due to the extra costs associated with physical miners.

They're selling "perpetual" contracts based on a fixed hash rate, not a share of total output. For example if you buy a 1 Th/s miner, you can offer 1000 x 1 Gh/s contracts. That would be a 1/1000 share of the total output. Now, if you bought another 1 Th/s miner you could offer another 1000 contracts. Each contract would now be a 1/2000 share of the total output.
Now, the contract may be perpetual, but that does not mean that it will be profitable forever, it just means you will have that 1 Gh/s contract until you sell it.


No, it's because the contracts are for a fixed hash rate and as difficulty increases you will get less reward for the same hash rate. How many times does this need to be explained to you?

There's simply no need to add monetary incentives to seed content. If content is popular it will already be well seeded and if it isn't popular, it doesn't need to be. Also, if your going to pay people to download content from them, why not pay the creators of the content instead of random people?
This is just people involved with bitcoin trying to cash in on bittorrent without understanding the bittorrent community.

How does bitcoin contradict socialism. Bitcoin mining is actually a pretty good example of socialism in practice. The bitcoin miners own and control the infrastructure and are rewarded in a fair and proportional manner to the amount of work they contribute.
How on earth is that incompatible with socialism, where workers own and control the means of production and receive a fair and  proportional reward for the work they contribute?

I'm not a stock trader so I can't say whether it's undervalued compared to other stocks, but ASICMINER is way overvalued compared to BFL ASICs and upcoming ASICs from BitFury and KnCminer.
ASICminer is overvalued because it's basically been the only player in the game. That's changing though and as the other companies roll out their ASICs, ASICMINER's share of the network hash rate is going to plummet, causing a decrease in dividends. ASICMINER dividends are also seeing a boost due to sales of extremely overpriced USB miners. Again, once other companies devices are readily available, do you think anyone in their right mind would purchase a 300 Mh/s miner when they could get a 5 GH/s miner for the same price? That drop in USB sales will also cause the dividends to decrease.
So no, I don't think they're undervalued at all. I think they're way overvalued.

The price went from 30 USD/BTC to $260 USD/BTC. I've no idea why you are fixating on 135 USD/BTC. At the moment, the price is around 100 USD/BTC and it drops down to about 90 USD/BTC on the weekends. It's been at those levels for weeks now.
The drop down to 100 USD/BTC wasn't a crash, it was a the price correcting itself after the bubble burst.
Why is AM share price inflated? For the following reasons:
It basically has a monopoly at the moment.
It's hardware is weak compared to competitors hardware.
It's dividends are poor compared to owning a competitors ASIC miner yourself.
It's dividends are poor compared to those of other stocks.
With competition just around the corner, they will not be able to maintain their current share of the network so mining dividends will drop. Also, they will no longer be able to sell hardware at the prices they do now, so income from hardware sales will also drop.

I bet plenty of people have thought the same, right before losing a load of money. There's always risk involved.


Not for me it doesn't. The extra cost for electricity due to GPU mining is pretty negligible. My PC is always on and put to good use. I've been using a PC in that manner for around 15 years now.
As for the the 5 GH/s BFLs, they use about 30W. That's less than a light bulb and about 1/5 of what my GPU consumes.
Also, as I've stated on numerous occasions, there's nothing for me to pay off or recoup. The hardware I'm mining on is meant for gaming. Mining is just a sweet bonus. Plenty of people are doing the same thing as I am. If you know about bitcoin and own a gaming rig, you'd be stupid not to mine. It means free games and hardware upgrades.

I don't need to trust Josh on the number of orders figure and neither does anyone who has an order with BFL. They can just log in to their account, check the order and then check the invoice number (which you get once you pay for the device). My order number is 1000387xx and my invoice number is 1000167xx. So what he's saying there about orders checks out.
How is it not a good idea? [This link here]( shows the relationship between difficulty and network hash rate. A network hash rate of 1000 Th/s results in a difficulty of:
    1e+15 * 600 * 0xFFFF / 2^48 = 139,696,254.564
If you plug the numbers into a bitcoin mining calculator, you'll see that you'll make 0.018 BTC per day. If we assume that a 5 Gh/s BitForce costs 3 BTC with shipping, then it would take 167 days to make back that 3 BTC.
If you buy a share in ASICMINER for 2.5 BTC, how long will it take you to make that 2.5 BTC back? With fixed dividends of 0.01 BTC per week, it would take 250 weeks. Dividends would need to increase to 0.1 BTC per week for it would take about 175 days to make that 2.5 BTC back.
Is it worth ordering a BFL? Definitely!

How can the the contents of the ballot be specified by an attacker?
I've seen you're posts about people being forced to vote, but those examples are based on our current system of representative democracy and are problems with that system. In the worst case, those problems would still exist.
Like I said elsewhere, there's no point in trying to force a few people to vote a specific way because in order to benefit, you'd need the vote to actually go your way. This would require forcing as many people as necessary in order to ensure the vote is won and that could be the majority of the people.
How are going to force half the population to vote the way you want them to? Threats of violence? Bribes? Blackmail?
Under representative democracy, those wanting to force the vote simply bypass the voters and force the representatives. Direct democracy solves that problem by making the middleman obsolete.
Forcing the vote under direct democracy would be incredibly expensive. How much money would it take to bribe a single person to vote against their interests for something trivial? How much for something they consider important?

I get what you're saying, and the Jupiters and Saturns offer far better value but KnC are a complete unknown at this point, whereas BFL have conquered their problems the hard way. Their miners deliver the stated performance and usually more. I'd say get one by November by the absolute latest, but more likely in September/October.
@_date: 2013-05-09 11:20:30
For those wondering how this would compare to a BFL, here's the answer.
With a network hash rate of 1000 Th/s, a 5 GH/s miner would have 0.0005% of the total hashing power. That's equivalent to mining with a 409 Mh/s miner at the moment, which would earn around 0.02 BTC per day.
Using an estimate of $100 per BTC, then you would need to mine 2.74 BTC to recover the costs for the device, so let's just say 3 BTC. Even at 1000 Th/s, it would only take a 5 Gh/s BFL around 150 days to mine 3 BTC and recoup the initial cost.

I take it you bought in at the 0.0009xx high then? I put a bid in for 0.0005 and got 1000, even though the asking price was still at 0.0009xx.
I wouldn't worry about their price dropping, it's very early days for AMC. They'll have their Avalons in a week or two and I wouldn't be surprised if the price is 0.002 BTC by then. I'd expect a massive rise when they've got their own ASIC running. Look at 100TH, the price increased from 0.138 to 0.249 (only 1 share at that price then it's up to 0.29) overnight with their latest report about the wafer.
@_date: 2013-06-13 08:41:44
That shows that the hash rate has increased from 34.14 Th/s to 36.8 Th/s. That's 2.66 Th/s. At that rate, they could put out 100 Th/s in 38 days.

If you can, image the disks.
You've basically eradicated the index information for the files on the disk so you'll have to scan the disk for specific bytes.
If the wallet was encrypted, you're probably screwed. If it wasn't, it may be possible to recover the wallet, or at least some of the keys from it.
The first thing to do is learn about the structure of the wallet. Then download a hex editor like [HxD]( which will allow you to work with the drive on a byte by byte basis.
So, you'd basically open the drive, search for an account name or address which you can remember. In this way, you may be able to salvage some of the private keys.
If you're extremely lucky, you may be able to figure out where the wallet begins and ends. In that case you could select that range of bytes and write them to a new "wallet.dat" file.
Recovering the whole wallet file is extremely unlikely so I'd concentrate on trying to recover the private keys.
Try creating a brand new wallet and opening the file in HxD to see how it looks. Make a few changes to the wallet and reopen it to see how the changes are stored. With a bit of luck, you may be able to figure it out.

Why do capitalist always spout this complete and utter bullshit? Only a tiny fraction of people who were born poor, actually become wealthy. Those who are in that tiny fraction were extremely lucky. It wasn't because they were extremely smart or had an extremely good plan. They were in the right place at the right time and exploited the situation for their own benefit.


If you thinks socialists are Luddites then you're seriously mistaken. You'll find that most of us fully support the automaton of labour. A lot of us think this automation will force a switch to socialism as unemployment rises due to technological unemployment and that such automation is an essential part of communism.
Where human labour is required though, socialists want workers to be the ones making the profit from their labour, as opposed to some person born with a silver spoon up their arse, sitting on a beach doing fuck all, while paying a worker to manage their money for them.
Again let me put this into bitcoin language.

Do the maths and you'll see that they can't maintain their percentage.
BFL alone had 75,000 chips which are capable of about 4 Gh/s, that's 300 Th/s. [This site]( shows almost 400 Th/s to come from BFL pre-orders and that site isn't even complete. Then there's the chip sales to factor in as well. Avalon have around 100 Th/s in systems waiting to ship and around 150 Th/s in chips. 100TH has 200 Th/s (100 Th/s being sold for shares and 50 Th/s being sold to Metabank) set for July/August. KnC has about 200 Th/s from those 500 pre-orders set for September/October.
People claiming that ASICMINER will maintain their share of the network are either purposefully lying or simply ignorant of the hashing power that their competitors are set to roll out over the next few months.

I just said that the profit is shared after operating costs have been paid. Also, under socialism, not everyone receives the same amount. Different types of works receive different pay, for example, a machine operator and a manager would receive different amounts.
Does the pool owner keep the block reward for themselves and pay the miners a tiny fraction of what they should have earned? No! Then it's not capitalist.
It's most definitely socialist. The pool owner gets the block reward, pays the operating costs and pays the miners a proportion of the rewards based on the amount of work they contributed. That's socialism, whether you like that word or not.

With the price of PURCHASE set to drop to around 0.04 it'll be interesting to see how the market decide on how to price MINING. With TAT.VM still selling for around 0.004 BTC, MINING could sell as high as 0.02 BTC, meaning SELLING would also be priced at around 0.02 BTC.
If you sell before the dividends, for around 0.035, then you've made 0.004 BTC profit. If you sold after the dividends for around 0.025, you'd make 0.002 BTC profit.
If you hold, you'll likely recoup your costs in about 2-4 months.
I'm going to try and sell before the dividends for around 0.035 and take the profit.

As long as you buy in before the dividends are paid out, you'll get those dividends. DMS.SELLING dividends are paid out the day after the difficulty increase, which should be a few hours from now. You should have untill 5 PM GMT Friday to buy in.
After you get the dividends, sell DMS.SELLING and buy back in again at the next increase.

No, I'm not, I'm just looking further ahead than you are. You say they'll end up employed somewhere else. I say that "somewhere else" is not immune to automation and the jobs will not be available because the work will be done by machinery. You claim there's no limit to the amount of work that can be done, but that doesn't mean that it will be people doing that work.


Stealing all the land and taking away my means of survival, then telling me I have to work for you for a fraction of the profit created by my labour or starve to death, is not voluntary in the slightest.


It's not voluntary and I can and will call it theft.= because that's precisely what it is.


We already have a very basic molecular assemble and the technology will advance. Explain how capitalism or socialism even is supposed to survive when everyone has the means of production in their living room. Wealth becomes obsolete at that point. This is not a case of whether it will happen, it's a case of when.


So what? Like I said, socialism is an evolution of capitalism and communism is an evolution of socialism.


No, it isn't. Some people will use "the government" and "the State" interchangeably, but I never said "the government", I simply said "government" as in the act of governing something, not a group of people.


I wouldn't sign such an agreement, so do your laws not apply to me? 


Why are they allowed to force their will on me?


Not by me they wasn't, so obviously they have no authority whatsoever over me.


Why because I violated some rules which you made up? What if I claim you only made up those rules after the deed? What a crime? Who defined these crimes and how? Who are they generally recognised by and how?


So what you're saying is that your society would have discussed between its members and came up with a bill of rights? How is that not an act of direct democracy that I've been claiming all along?


How were those "norms" decided upon? Direct democracy by any chance?
What you call "individual agreement and acceptance" is simply another name for direct democracy. This becomes quite obvious when you look at it more closely, as proven above, precisely like I said it was.

I never declared what the share price would be, but it will definitely be above 0.01. I have no intention of dumping any of my shares for a good few months and there's no need to pump this stock. The share price will rise significantly within 2 weeks due to hashing power coming online.
A Labcoin share price of 0.1 BTC is based on ASICMiner having a share price of 2.5 BTC and Labcoin being equally as profitable as AM is now.
10,000,000 shares / 400,000 shares = 25  
2.5 BTC / 25 = 0.1 BTC
Labcoin's 3-4 TH/s will be about 0.5% of the network hash rate in 2 weeks, bringing in weekly dividends from mining of between 0.00000882 BTC and 0.00001235 (after taking into account 30% being reinvested). If we assume the network hash rate is about 1000 Th/s by the time Labcoin gets it's 50 Th/s online, then Labcoin's share of the network hash rate would be about 5% and dividends from mining would be between 0.00008820 BTC and 0.00012348 (after taking into account 30% being reinvested).
For the price of 1 AM share you can currently get about 700 Labcoin shares, yet in 2 months times, not only will those 1000 Labcoin shares have increased in price by around 10x, they'll also be paying mining dividends totalling between 0.06 BTC and 0.085 BTC, which is far better than the mining dividends from 1 share of AM.
I'm not trying to trick people here, it's just a tip for people who have bitcoin but haven't looked into investing. Buying Labcoin shares now is like buying ASICMiner shares when they cost 0.3 BTC. There's going to be a lot of people kicking themselves in 2 weeks time for not acting upon this tip now.

No. Dividends are paid out at about 5 PM GMT, the day after the increase. That block countdown is only for the difficulty increase. If you're going to sell, make sure you've actually received your dividends first. Check your balance or the "History" tab, right-side pane.
If the difficulty increase occurs within the next 3 hours, dividend will be paid out tomorrow at 5 PM GMT, but I think that is unlikely to happen.
So dividends will be paid out either 20 hours from now (if the increase occurs within the next 3 hours) or 44 hours from now.

share cost = 2.5 BTC
dividends = 0.02 BTC per week
ROI = 125 weeks
In order for a 5 GH/s BFL to take that long, difficulty would need to be about 880 million, meaning the network hash rate would need to be around 6300 Th/s.
Even with a network hashrate of 1000 Th/s, a 5 Gh/s BFL will take about 5 months to make your money back. If you had one today, it would only take about 2 weeks.
You're spot on about those ASICminer shares. They're insanely overpriced. When all the other companies roll out ASICs, they're not going to be able to keep their share of the network hash rate so dividends and share price will fall, as will the cost of any hardware they sell.

Power consumption was never mentioned in the actual bet and no power consumption was advertised at all unless you count the forum post from 2012 stating the initial specs. If you're going to count that forum post, then you must include the other posts which were made before the bet was created. Post which state that the power consumption was 7.5W per chip.
So, if you want to play that game, at the time the bet was created, the "advertised" power consumption was 7.5W per chip.
The bet was clearly ambiguous and never should have been allowed in the first place according to BitBet's FAQ, so why wasn't it cancelled?

Yes, they do. They clearly do. To deny this is beyond stupidity. If you think otherwise, then show me a single pool which does not pay its miners based on the proportion of work they contribute. You clearly can't do this because you are simply talking out of your arse.


And those terms state that the miner will receive a fair and proportional payment based on the proportion of work they contribute.


I'm not trying to convince you that capitalism is a measure of how fair/unfair something it. I'm simply claiming that the rewards for bitcoin mining is socialist in nature. Also, what makes you think pool operators own the equipment? Most of them are simply renting the servers. Most of them also maintain the site themselves, which makes them workers. The capitalists in this scenario are the owners of the data centre which hosts the servers.


Why would I delete that? Most people are not stupid enough to not understand what an example is.


Of course it's still capitalist. How could it not be given that you claim it's privately owned means of production? Let us ignore that point though in order to address your argument. There's no longer exploitation of the miners when the pool operator does work and receives a payment for that work the same as the miners. The pool operator is also entitled to extra payment for maintaining the pool. The highest fee I've seen on a pool is 3%. That a fair payment for their work. Where is the line drawn you ask? The line isn't drawn because the pools are not actually socialist, they're simply using a reward system which is socialist in nature.
Can you imagine a corporate CEO only getting 3% more than the lowest paid worker?
Bitcoin mining rewards are inherently socialist in nature. If you don't like that fact, go and start a your own pool using a capitalist reward system where you keep 90% of the rewards. For some reason, I don't think it will be successful.

That 100% of Internet users would purchase something for a penny if they could? It *probably* will not happen. What about 1% though?


Because they currently don't know that they can! What's stupid is you not understanding that the Internet has provided a new way of doing business. A way that does not require parasitic middle men. A way that does not require ripping off your customers by charging them excessive amounts of money. Instead of embracing such a system, you'd rather prop up corporations using business models which the Internet has made obsolete.


No I don't. How is that even relevant though? I'm providing a valid example of how payments of 1p can be very useful, which is what you questioned. If you had a good digital product, you could charge a penny and become a millionaire from selling to 5% of your potential customers.

What you are complaining about is the fact that you need to follow the rules of society and you don't want to follow certain rules you disagree with.
This complaint is pure nonsense at its finest and has absolutely nothing to do with direct democracy. You want to gain the benefits from being a member of society while simultaneously ignoring the restrictions such membership places upon you. If you can't accept such restrictions, you can't be a part of any society because they all have rules which are essential in order to allow them to function.
It wouldn't matter if those rules were the product of an absolute monarchy, representative democracy or direct democracy. You simply don't want to follow rules you don't agree with it.
Also, "natural laws" the way you are using that term, are simply a social construct in order to allow society to function more smoothly. The only reason you have more of a "right to life" than a gazelle being hunted by a lioness is because the society you live in says you do. There is nothing natural about it. It's quite obviously man-made.

0.018 BTC per day.


If you had the device today with the network hash rate being around 100 Th/s, you'd be making 0.2069 BTC per day. Given the current exchange rate, it would take about 11 days to recover your costs.
With the network hash rate at 1000 Th/s (10x greater than it currently is), and assuming the exchange rate doesn't change, it would take about 119 days to recover your costs.
Nobody can tell you when you would receive your device if ordered today though, and nobody can tell you what the network hash rate will be at that time. I'd guess that if you ordered a device today, you'll recover your costs this year.
I'd avoid those little 300 Mh/s USB ones for around 2 BTC. You'd be better off just getting a decent AMD video card. For the others, if you can afford them, then sure, why not. They're not as cheap as BFL per Gh/s but you'll be mining far sooner.

Here in the UK, the main infrastructure was originally nationalised and only later privatised. The current regulations force the private company (British Telecom) to open up that infrastructure for use by other companies at a reasonable cost, reducing the barrier to entry into that market. This means that most people in the UK have a far greater choice of ISPs than those in the US and due to the competition, they can get broadband from £2 a month from Tesco.

So let me get this straight.
Your society has a bill of rights for its city, yet this bill of rights was somehow individually determined? Does this bill of rights include the names of everyone living in the city and all the rights which these people have decided they individually have?
This society also has laws determined in the same manner as the bill of rights, basically a list of people and all the laws they have decided for themselves. What happens when those laws conflict with each other? Who determined that? Also, this society has certain norms which were also determined individually. How then, can they possibly be norms of society if they wasn't determined by society?

Look at this giant pile of nonsense you've created, all because you refuse to admit something which is blatantly obvious - that in a society, each person does not make up their own rules and try to enforce them on everyone else (while claiming you're not allowed to force people to do stuff), they discuss with each other and come up with a set of rules that they agree on. You've demonstrated that your society clearly functions in this way - bill of rights, laws, courts, societal norms, etc - you simply refuse to admit that you were wrong, that those functions came about through collective discussion.

That's the main reason why ASICMINER is overpriced, the lack of competition. By the time BFL have shipped all their back orders, they'll have brought more hashing power online than ASICMINER.
With BFL products then available off the shelves, they'll provide far better value than ASICMINER shares at current prices. That's a couple of months away. ASICMINER can't possibly bring 2,000 Th/s online because they only have 250 Th/s in the pipeline. They'll introduce the next gen chip after that but they still wont have 2,000 Th/s any time this year, nor next year neither. For ASICMINER to have any hope of being competitive, share prices will have to fall.

Networked devices have an IP address such as 103.56.65.193. Every website has such an IP address but they can be difficult to remember so we associate domain names with those addresses.
A domain name is a web address like reddit.com. When you type "reddit.com" into the web browser, the computer performs a "dns lookup" which sends the domain name to a central server which then returns the IP address associated with that domain name.
Namecoin provides that functionality in a distributed manner using a blockchain like bitcoin, instead of relying on a central server.

BFL has finally overcome its problems and is now shipping in fair quantities. While the Jupiter offers better value than the Minirig, I think you'll receive a Minirig before a KnC if ordered today. The proceeds from the Minirig would be enough to buy a Jupiter within 2 months.

You should be aware that after tomorrows dividend payout, the price of DMS.PURCHASE will fall to around 0.04 BTC from 0.048759 BTC. The price of DMS.MINING and DMS.SELLING add up roughly to the price of DMS.PURCHASE. For example, f DMS.MINING was being sold for 0.015 BTC, DMS.SELLING would cost around 0.025 BTC.
If you're planning on selling your shares after you get the dividends you should take the above into account. If you want to guarantee a profit, you could sell now for around 0.035 BTC though.

Forgive me for not understanding the lingo you just made up. You seem to be describing communism, which people call communism, not communist socialism. That just sounds weird to me.


The Marxist variety, where technological advancements in the means of communication and production will sow the seeds for the destruction of capitalism. Oh wait, that was from the 19th century and its now the 21st. Trains are no longer the ultimate form of communication, the Internet is. Factory assembly lines are no longer the ultimate means of production, replicators are.


In a word where we have the technology to replicate stuff like on Star Trek, why on earth would you need money? What would you do with this "money" thing. Trade it with me? Why the hell would I want it if I can replicate whatever I want?


That's the step after communism, when we become digital immortals, abandon are bodies and upload our minds to the net.

No it doesn't. That ASIC cost me 1.6 BTC which was about 6 months of part time mining with a HD6870. I make about 0.1 BTC per week mining 24/7 with that HD6870 at the present time. Like I showed previously, if the total network hashrate was around 1000 TH/s, I'd still make around 0.1 BTC. That means it'd take about 16 weeks to mine 1.6 BTC with a 5 GH/s ASIC if the network hashrate was about 1000 TH/s.
I don't have anything to recover though. I mined the coins to purchase the ASIC using my GPU, which was also purchased from bitcoins mined on an 8 year old CPU. It simply isn't possible for me to make my money back because I didn't put any in in the first place.

If those numbers are unrealistic now, then they were most certainly unrealistic a year ago. We know for a fact there hasn't been 715 Th/s added in a month so I'm not sure what you're trying to say here.




It went up by about that amount when the Avalons and Asicminer's went online. These companies have a limited capacity to produce the ASIC chips though. Take BFL for example, they said they can ship 400 5 GH/s ASICs per day when ramped up. That's about 12,000 per month which is 60 Th/s per month.


That's not true. There's been a few units shipped and received so far. They may have been ordered 9 months ago but they've only just become ready to ship now. Obviously they can't ship something which does not exist. I ordered a 5 GH/s on the 10th last month. My position in the queue is 16732. If BFL can actually ship 400 a day, then mine should ship in about 40 days after they ramp up production.

It people lost money it was because they bought at the high and panic sold. I agree most people would not have made 25% profit, some people may have though as someone filled the asks up to 0.031 BTC at 17:47 BST (25 minutes after the dividends).
I actually sold before the dividends for 0.035049 BTC, making around 0.005 BTC profit per share. I also advised someone here on reddit to buy in at 0.031 BTC and sell at 0.035 BTC because I expected the share price to drop to about 0.025 BTC. That actually did happen but it went back up to 0.031 BTC pretty damn quickly.
If you want to sell a large number of shares you don't do it by putting them all up for a single price. That just forces people to outbid you. You sell a few at a time.
All you are basically saying here is that people who panic and make bad decisions might have lost money. That's true for every stock.

Digital files can be duplicated at the press of a button and can be distributed for storage all over the globe. If you have multiple copies at different locations, then realistically, the only way to stop you from being able to access your wallet is by stopping you from accessing the Internet. If your wallet is strongly encrypted them it makes no difference who has access to the file because only you can access the contents, so there is no reason to fear people stealing your wallet because they can't access the keys within it.
By using a paper wallet, you're ultimately saying that you don't trust cryptography to keep your bitcoins secure, which is bizarre because Bitcoin relies on cryptography to keep your coins secure.

That would require 715 Th/s worth of miners to come online each month. That's equivalent to:
* 143,165 5 Gh/s miners
* 28,633 25 Gh/s miners
* 14,316 50 Gh/s miners
Let's look at the Avalon numbers:
* Avalon batch 1 = 300 @ 65 Gh/s
* Avalon batch 2 = 600 @ 65 Gh/s
* Avalon batch 3 = 600 @ 65 Gh/s
* Avalon total = 1500 @ 65 Gh/s = 97.5 Th/s
Avalon would have to ship 18 batches of 600 in a month to put out 715 Th/s a month. The numbers you're quoting simply aren't realistic.
@_date: 2013-05-09 12:44:33


Just so you know, the order number is irrelevant, what counts is the invoice number. My order number is 1000387xx which was placed on the 10th of April 2013. My invoice number is 1000167xx. So from that, I could estimate that the order placed on 2013/05/08 with order number 100054377 would have an invoice number of around 100023642. That's about 12 weeks at 400 pieces a day.


You can't ship something if you don't have anything to ship. Their past promises are completely irrelevant. The only thing that matters is how many they can ship once production is ramped up, which clearly hasn't happened yet.




Then stop spreading bullshit as if you have some inside knowledge and know for a fact that they can't. Why should anyone trust the word of someone who owns ASICMiner shares? The more people you convince to cancel their ASIC orders, the more profit you make.

BitFunder is simply a stock exchange, like Mt.Gox is a currency exchange.
You want to buy shares in one of the companies listed on BitFunder, one that runs a mining operation. You purchase those shares with bitcoins and they pay you dividends that include the income form mining. The amount paid out differs depending on numerous factors such as percentage of network hashrate, number of shares, amount invested in more hardware, etc. Check the description for that listing to find out its details and check its dividend history to see how it's paid out in the past.
In order to get funds into BitFunder, you must go through a payment site called WeExchange which is total pain in the arse. If you are just looking to buy shares in ASICMINER-PT or TAT.ASICMINER, you'd be better off using BTC-TC instead as they allow you to deposit directly with them. A TAT.ASICMINER share is simply 100th of an ASICMINER share. When you get 100+ TAT.ASICMINER shares, you can sell them and buy an ASICMINER-PT share.

No it isn't. DMS.SELLING dividends basically depend on the difficulty increase.
Price per share was about 0.035 BTC and dividends were 0.01107977 BTC with the 23% increase. ASICMINER shares cost 100x that, yet the dividends are only about 4x greater at most.
Tomorrows dividends will be about 0.0035 to 0.004 BTC with the 10.3 increase. That's still 5-10 x less dividends than AM for 100th the cost.

Socialism is all about direct democracy in government and in the work place through worker control of the means of production.
Bitcoin mining is extremely socialist in nature. The blockchain is a record of direct democracy in action and miners are paid a fair and proportional reward based on the proportion of the work they contribute.
Socialism is meant to come after capitalism. The capitalist stage being required to build up the necessary material and social conditions. It seems to me your basing your ideas of socialism on Leninism, which was a failed attempt to implement socialism in a feudal society, bypassing the capitalist stage.
Leninism and its offshoots are highly centralised because they need to force build the non-existent means of production. Socialism in an advanced capitalist nations today would be mostly decentralised with essential infrastructure such as water, power, communications, etc, being nationalised and only while it needed to be. For example, it could be assumed that power would become decentralised by people putting solar panels on their roofs, etc.
The difference between socialism and capitalism is that under socialism, the workers become the shareholders and they govern through direct democracy rather than representative democracy. On that note, a blockchain would be a good way to record the decisions made by such a direct democracy.

Your the one who changed the subject with your lame, "Herp derp, communist is evil, violent oppression, derp!" statement. I merely pointed out that all societies have rules and punishments for breaking those rules.
I'm not wrong about bitcoin mining in the slightest. It's socialist in nature as proven by the fact that miners receive a proportional share of the profit based on the proportion of the work they contribute. If bitcoin mining was based on capitalistic principles, then Satoshi would be getting all the reward from mining, then paying the miner that actually found the block a tiny fraction of that reward.
Bitcoin mining is socialist in nature and nothing you can do or say will change that fact.

Society is also inherently collectivist.


How is me voting for a political party that I agree with forcing anybody to do anything against their wishes? Now, when the party comes to power and forces capitalists to give up their shares in companies or start actually working for them, that would be use of force. But isn't force allowed to be used for self-defense? And don't you consider an an act of violence against an aggressor to be self-defense? Given that such a society sees claiming ownership of land and means of production as acts of aggression, isn't that society acting in self-defense?


Say I was the person who actually put in the labour which made you that $100. I need money in order to live, therefore I'll take what jobs I can so I don't die. Why should you get $100 from my work simply because you are rich enough to own means of production. How is that not theft? What have you got to complain about if the government takes $50 of that money which I made for you while you sat on a beach somewhere in the sun?


Nothing can turn an unethical decision into an ethical one, so why try and saddle that on the will of the majority? The will of the majority is certainly a fairer representation of society than the will of the minority though.


There is no problem for me. It's simply an example of technology eliminating jobs. There are a finite number of jobs available and an ever increasing labour pool to fill them. Some people will get new jobs, others wont be so lucky. If you think there are an infinite number of jobs then you're clearly delusional.


The Luddites were against such technological unemployment and tried to destroy the technology and halt its progress. I'm all for such progress and the unemployment it will bring. It's not a fallacy and there's nothing Luddite about it. It's an historical fact that technological progress replaces people with machinery.


Yes, we do more productive and efficient work and such work doesn't require as many people as it used to. That's the point I'm making. Eventually, unemployment level will reach a breaking point and society will collapse. Under socialism, the workers would be making more money as they would be the shareholders. Therefore they can work less hours and employ more people, thereby avoiding such a collapse.


No, it's a problem created by technological progress. It will happen as long as technology advances. My solution is for the people to take over everything and govern society through direct democracy over the Internet. I don't delude myself into thinking that socialism is immune to these problems though, it's simply better able to handle them due to workers receiving a fair and proportional share of profits based on the proportion and type of the labour they contribute. Then it's a matter of waiting for technological progress to force another change in society - the change to communism. That will be brought about through further advancements in automation of mental labour, power and most importantly molecular assemblers.
It's not government which is meant to go away, it's the State which is meant to go away. Like I said, you can't have any society if you don't have a method to govern the interactions of its members.


Arrested, tried and convicted by who? Where did these people come from and who gave them power? The answer is simple and obvious. They were created and given power by the will of the majority.


And what if I tell you to shove your laws up your arse, laugh in your face, beat you to a bloody pulp then leave your premises. You claimed I'd be breaking the law, subdued and convicted. Again I ask, who by? Also who's law would I be breaking?


So, you propose to create an agreement and contract for every single interaction between people? That's insane.


Yes we have covered it. I claimed all along these things were required by society. In your society, how are these things created? I've already told you that in my society, they're created through direct democracy, that is, the members of society discussing it between themselves, coming up with solutions and choosing the best.

Do you paper wallet people not understand the risks associated with something so insecure? In order to steal all the bitcoins from your paper wallet, all someone has to do is take a photo, import the key into their wallet and transfer your coins.
A digital wallet with strong encryption and uploaded all over the Internet is far more secure and accessible than any paper wallet. If you don't trust in cryptography to keep your wallet secure then what the hell are you buying bitcoins for in the first place?

With a network hash rate of 1000 Th/s, a 5 GH/s miner would have 0.0005% of the total hashing power. That's equivalent to mining with a 409 Mh/s miner at the moment, which would earn around 0.02 BTC per day.
Using an estimate of $100 per BTC, then you would need to mine 2.74 BTC to recover the costs for the device, so let's just say 3 BTC. Even at 1000 Th/s, it would only take a 5 Gh/s BFL around 150 days to mine 3 BTC and recoup the initial cost.

Which is just as vulnerable as the original paper wallet. Paper wallets just lying around the house are completely insecure and the more you have lying around in different places, the greater the chance of someone finding them.


What makes you think that? Perhaps they kept them in their purse.


I'm not, but then I'm not your average user. So let's look at it from their perspective. I'd advise the same measures as taken for creating a paper wallet, but instead of actually creating a paper wallet, you just encrypt the file and copy it to disc or thumb drive, transfer it to a computer with an Internet connection, then store it all over the place.
If your using paper wallets then you really should be physically securing them from both physical damage and theft.

My guess would be that AM has shipped less hashing power. 150 Blades + less than 10,000 USBs.
10,000 USBs comes to around 3.5 Th/s and 150 Blades comes to around 1.5 Th/s. So less than 5 Th/s, which is equivalent to 10 Minirigs. Given that 5 were shipped the first week, I see no reason to doubt that at least 5 were shipped last week as well.

I mine on my system with an HD6870. I make about 0.01 BTC per day, so it would take about 3-4 months to mine 1 BTC at current difficulty. Difficulty will skyrocket soon though and I don't believe I'll be able to mine 1 BTC in the next year, never mind 6 months.
If I didn't have a GPU and I wasn't a PC gamer, I'd just order a 5 GH/s BFL. Sure, you'll have to wait a few months, but the sooner you order one the sooner you'll get it. It's pretty much the only cheap ASIC out there at the moment.

Socialism in the tradition sense is a bunch of factory workers owning the factory and running it democratically through soviet councils and recallable delegates.
My version is just updated to actually make it relevant to the world today instead of pretending that it's still the 19th century.
What I just described is socialism in a developed nation in the 21st century. You can call it what you want, but socialism is workers owning and controlling the infrastructure democratically.
When people say that we should implement socialism, this is the type of stuff they mean, not "let's reimplement Stalin's policies". Not, "lets take everyone's wealth and share it out equally". Not, "lets kill everyone who disagrees with us". But, "let's remove the parasitic middlemen, thereby stopping them from stealing 90% of the value created by the workers".

Under socialism, wage labourers don't receive the full fruit of their labour either due to the operating costs of their work place. They receive a share of profits after costs.
@_date: 2013-06-12 14:09:55


Socialists also stand against corporate capitalism, the State, centralisation of power and corporatism.
Socialists want workers to control the means of production and be paid a fair and proportional reward based on the proportion and type of labour they contribute. Basically, workers become the shareholders.
Capitalists want to control the means of production, without having to do any of the work. They do this by paying workers the smallest wage they can get away with, while keeping most of the profit for themselves.
Let me put that into the language of bitcoin. Bitcoin miners are socialists. They receive a fair and proportional reward based on the proportion of work they contribute.

I think my example confused you. In that example, your wallet is the lock, your password is the key. Because the lock (wallet) has become damaged (corrupted), the key (password) no longer opens it.
The private bitcoin keys (which are what you need to spend bitcoins) are encrypted within your wallet and can only be accessed by first decrypting the wallet, which you cannot do because the password no longer works due to the wallet being corrupted.

What if I only have 1 song which I want to sell for 1p and don't want to use any payment provider? I can currently do this but if the exchange rate goes over a certain value, then I wouldn't be able to.


Is it? When do indie games makes the most money? When they're on sale in Steam. It's simply common sense that more people will by a product if it's vastly cheaper than the competition. So, I could sell a song for 100p and sell 1,000 copies. I could sell that song   20p and sell 10,000 copies. I could sell that song for 1p and sell 1,000,000 copies. There's currently around 2.4 billion Internet users. Imagine if everyone of them used bitcoin and bought that song for 1p, that's £24 million.
The only thing stopping an individual from selling in this fashion is a the lack of a good enough microtransaction payment service. Bitcoin provides that ability.

If course it matters. The pool operator is equivalent to a factory manager and miners are equivalent to assembly line workers. I've already explained to you that different types or workers receive different amounts under socialism. Socialists are not against the manger receiving more pay than the assembly line workers.


And yet, the miners still receive a fair and proportional amount of the profit based on the proportion of the work which they contributed, making it quite clearly and quite obviously socialist in nature. 
Do "wage slaves" earn a fair proportion of the profits based on the proportion of the work they contributed to generate those profits? No, they earn a flat wage.
If mining pools were capitalist like you claim, then they'd only distribute about 1 BTC between the miners for every 25 BTC they received.

That is socialism in the style of Marx, updated for today. Today you learned that worker co-ops are socialist. 
Socialism is workers owning and controlling the infrastructure through direct democracy.
Leninism is not the same as Marxism. Leninists would have you believe that Leninism is a continuation of Marxism by calling themselves Marxist-Leninists but that is complete nonsense. Lenin completely ignored or misunderstood Marx when it came to the dictatorship of the proletariat, implementing an actual dictatorship, instead of the direct democracy espoused by Marx, as shown [here](
Bakunin: "There are about forty million Germans. Are all forty million going to be members of the government?"  
Marx: "Certainly, because the thing starts with the self-government of the commune."
Kautsky continued were Marx left off, not Lenin, and most certainly not Stalin. Lenin used his power and influence to smear and attack Kautsky for daring to speak out against the lack of democracy for the majority of the workers. Turns out Kautsky was right and a lot of the stuff he warned Lenin about actually came to pass.
To me, saying Marxist-Leninist is like saying Marxist-Randian or Anarcho-Capitalist. It just does not compute.

Wouldn't that make the seller an irrational fool though? There are numerous exchanges, therefore that 20k BTC could be split between them and wouldn't have as much of an effect on the price. The seller would make more money and not crash the price.

I've no idea why people keep advocating the use of paper wallets. Paper wallets are inherently insecure. Remember, all you need to steal someone's bitcoins is their private key, which is exactly what is displayed on a paper wallet. Someone could steal your wallet by simply taking a picture of it. But you'll keep it in a safe or bank vault you say? Because safes never get cracked and banks never get robbed?
 
A far better method of cold storage is to very strongly encrypt a wallet and store multiple copies all over the place. If someone gets hold of your very strongly encrypted wallet, then there's nothing they can do with it. If someone gets hold of your paper wallet, then you can kiss goodbye to your bitcoins.

No. The 5 GH/s ASIC will produce a similar amount of BTC as the HD6870 does now, if the network hashrate is 1000 TH/s.


The 5 GH/s BFL is currently $274 which worked out to £211 with shipping to the UK. Bitcoins reached $266/BTC. $266 * 1.6 = $425.6. I sold at $170 EUR/BTC which gave me enough to cover transfer fees and the cost of the ASIC.


Make back what costs? All this is free shit for me. Do you not understand that? Besides, if you're going to say that a 5GH/s ASIC will produce the same amount of BTC as an HD6870, then I've already shown you that it would take about 16 weeks to mine 1.6 BTC.

The costs are vastly different. For example, a BFL minirig costs 22,200 USD for 500 GH/s whereas the KnC Jupiter costs 7,000 USD for 350 Gh/s and the Avalon based Terrahash costs 85 BTC for 180 Gh/s.

No, but they have products which will be available off the shelves in a few months when the back orders are delivered. Their products are available from 274 USD, so 2.74 BTC @ 100 USD per BTC. That's less than the current price of an ASICMINER share. A BFL device will also provide a far higher hash rate per dollar, providing far greater mining returns.
And with BFL available on the shelves, ASICMINER's income from hardware sales will decrease as they'll have to be competitive with BFL.

Would you still be willing to manage this?
I think we should go with KnC Jupiters instead of BFL Minirigs though. I've been reading a few threads on the bitcoin forum about them and I feel more confident towards them now.
The KnC Jupiter costs 6,995 USD. By charging 75 BTC each, that should cover any variations in the exchange rate, escrow fees and pay for a couple of months hosting. Any extra could be returned with he first dividends. I'd stick to 1000 shares though as to give more people an opportunity to get it on it. Each share providing 350 Mh/s for 0.075 BTC.
Due to the number of shares that need to managed, it may be worthwhile to list on one of the stock exchanges and Havelock and shown interest.
It you can get Avalon based systems for cheaper though and quickly enough to cover the difference in cost between it and the KNC, then that would be excellent. At 20,000 USD, they'd need to mine about 130 BTC before the KnC became available.
Perhaps, as others have said, it would be wise to get some of each if possible.

Avalon have already said that their 2nd gen chips will be coming in October and using 55 nm and BFL are already using 65nm.
ASICMINER has had the benefit of pretty much being the only player in the game so far, but that's changed now. BFL and Avalon will be pumping out systems and chips over the next few months which will decrease ASICMINER's network share. This will in turn decrease the dividends from mining. Dividends from hardware sales will also decrease due to 2 factors. First, due to the competition having devices on the market, hardware will have to sell for less and not as many devices will be sold. Second, the chips will be needed by the mining operation in order to keep as high a percentage of the network hashing power as possible, so not as much hardware will be able to be sold.
100TH will be coming online in July/August using 55 nm BitFury chips. Metabank.ru BitFury 120 GH/s systems will be shipping in August and 28nm Knc 175 GHs and 350 Gh/s systems will be shipping in September. In 2014 AMC will be producing 45nm and 28nm chips which will be used by VMC to make systems with.
So from now on, they've got a fair bet of competition.
If you look at ASICMINER from the perspective of a bitcoin miner, it's incredibably poor value.
44.04 Th/s  
400,000 shares  
2.8989 BTC per share  
110.100 Mh/s per share  
37.98 Mh/s per BTC  
379.78 kh/s per USD @ 100 USD/BTC  
BFL BitForce 5  
5 Gh/s  
274 USD  
2.74 BTC @ 100 USD/BTC  
18.249 Mh/s per USD  
1.825 Gh/s per BTC @ 100 USD/BTC  
A 5 GH/s BFL offer 48 times better value than an ASICMINER share. So, ASICMINER needs to increase their hash rate by a factor of 48 in order to offer competitve mining power.
ASICMINER initially ordered 50 Th/s of hashing power and have 200 Th/s in the pipeline. If we use this value for ASICMINER's hash rate we get the following numbers:
250 Th/s  
2.8989 BTC per share  
625 Mh/s per share  
215.599 Mh/s per BTC  
**TLDR**: In fact, at its current share price, ASICMINER would need to be hashing with over 2,000 Th/s in order to match the value of a 5 Gh/s BFL.

It's not that much of a credible threat though because like I pointed out, you may need to threaten the majority of the voters. Changing the vote of one voter is completely ineffectual when there are millions of voters. So, why make threats when there is nothing to gain from making those threats? It is a possibility though and could have an effect on small or close votes. That's why secret ballots are a good idea but it doesn't make them essential.
The blockchain would record voters keys but you can't tell who a voter is just from looking at their key. What's to stop me from pointing to some random key and claiming it to be mine?


What's wrong with that? Nobody said direct democracy required you to participate in every single vote, it simply provides you with the opportunity to do so. Naturally, people will vote on what they consider to be relevant.






They'd have to be able to prove how they voted and you've simply assumed that using the blockchain for voting would allow them to do so. I explained in another post that the bitcoin blockchain was specifically created for use with currency and that it would be better to create a voting transaction.
The basic form of such a transaction could look like the following:
    Input:
    Signature: ...
    Voter Public Key: ...
    Output:
    Proposal Public Key: ...
The input represents a voter and the output represents the option they voted for. The signature is simply the Proposal Public Key signed with the Voter Private Key. This form of transaction would be enough to ensure a single vote per private key and that each public key listed is valid.
As you can see, in its most basic form the secrecy of the ballot is preserved. The only data that can be obtained from that transaction is that a voter with the specified public key voted for the option with the specified public key.

With paper wallets it's not just about protection from theft, you have to think about protection from physical damage as well. An encrypted file hosted at multiple locations on the Internet is far more secure than anything in any household safe.
You say that you can't trust any machine, unless booted from a clean OS offline. What's stopping you from using that same system for creating the digital wallet?

I think you've lost track of the argument. The question asked was:


If Bitcoin didn't use a socialist model and was operating on capitalist principles instead, then Satoshi would be reaping all the rewards from bitcoin miners finding new blocks, then paying a fraction of that reward to the miner which found it. 
Fortunately for miners and for bitcoin, Satoshi decided to make the reward system socialist in nature, therefore miners receive a proportional share of the profits based on the proportion of the work they contributed.

I've been thinking about this as well. It's the blockchain which is useful, not the currency aspect.
The blockchain is basically is a list of blocks. A block is basically a list of transactions. A transaction is basically a transference of BTC from a list of inputs to a list of outputs.
It's the blocks that get hashed though, not the transactions, so the transactions can be replaced with something completely different. It would probably be better to create a voting transaction from scratch and avoid the currency aspect altogether.

Then you can't live in a society because all societies need some way to govern the interactions between people.


Which is fine if you live by yourself and never come in contact with other people. As soon as you move to a setting where other people exist, then you need some method to govern those interactions.

I was looking at getting some shares, but I'm unsure how it works.
Looking at G.ASICMINER-PT on BitFunding, it seems to me that dividends are paid out once a week. The last payout was 0.00773063 BTC per share.
A share costs 1.14 BTC (at the time of writing this), so that would take 148 weeks to make back that 1.14 BTC.
Is that correct?
After buying the shares, how do I get paid? Do they ask me for an address or something? Do they pay me weekly?

The price an hour before the dividend was 0.034899 BTC and the last sale was at 0.026997 BTC.
0.026997 * 100 / 0.034899 = 77.36%

ASICMINER will not maintain or increase its share in the long term. They can only do so while the other companies are not shipping their products. Avalon batch 2 and batch 3 will bring 78 TH/s, 100TH will bring around 100 Th/s in July, and whatever BFL and AMC bring to the table.
The ASICMINER dividends will fall once these come online as will the share price. As for them selling their hardware, that's going to be a lot more difficult when people can buy a BFL and have it shipped the same day. Do you seriously think people will pay 2 BTC for a 300 MH/s thumb drive when they can get a 5 GH/s BFL for that price?
The only reason ASICMINER is doing so well at the moment is because of the severe lack of competition.
Saying that, I do have some TAT.ASICMINER shares, as well as some AMC shares and a 5 Gh/s BitForce ordered on the 10th of April.

Tell that to the people who bought first day Jalapenos and have currently mined more than AM IPO shares have paid out in dividends.
@_date: 2013-05-26 12:26:25
You're analysis completely ignores BFL. By August, BFL should have shipped most or all of their current orders.
A 5Gh/s BitForce costs $274, which is about 2.1 BTC at current prices. That works out to 0.42 BTC per Gh/s or 0.084 BTC per 200 Mh/s. A 100TH share currently costs 0.275 BTC. That's about 3.3 times the cost of what you'd pay BFL for the same hash rate.
If we include the cost of shipping for the BFL and allow for some fluctuation in the price of bitcoins, then 3 BTC seems a conservative estimate for the maximum cost of a 5 Gh/s BitForce. That gives 0.6 BTC per Gh/s and 0.12 BTC per 200 Mh/s. That's still 2.3x cheaper than what 100TH shares are going for.
Buying a 5 Gh/s BFL today makes far more sense than spending $274 on 100TH shares today.
@_date: 2013-06-13 08:51:50

@_date: 2013-05-23 14:38:27


Perhaps, perhaps not. I doubt it though. You'll probably be looking at August/September. Will 100TH come online in July? Their latest post says:


To get 5 GH/s, you could give BFL 2.2 BTC or buy 25 shares with 100TH at 0.23900000 BTC per share which is 5.975 BTC.
5.975 - 2.2 = 3.775
At today's difficulty, 5 Gh/s would mine 0.2248 BTC per day, so it would take about 17 days to mine 3.775 BTC. Given that there's a good amount of hashing power set to come online in the next couple of months from ASICMINER, Avalon and BFL, I'd expect a large increase in difficulty by the time 100TH is online. It will probably take between 1-3 months to mine that 3.775, meaning you'd probably be better off buying the BFL now.

No, of course it isn't. How could that possibly be proof? BFL haven't had any product to ship for the past nine months so they couldn't possibly ship anything?
They've only shipped a few tens of units so far starting in April, therefore they clearly haven't ramped up production yet. They claimed they'll be able to ship 400 5 GH/s units a day and once production is ramped up, we'll see how accurate that claim was.

At 0.2 BTC per share that's 1 BTC per Gh/s. They don't expect to be mining online till July and the BFLs should be online by then. A 5 Gh/s BFL costs 2.2 BTC at current prices which is 0.44 BTC per Gh/s, so each 100TH share is only worth around 0.088 BTC. They're currently around 3 times that price.
I bought 2 100TH shares at 0.138 the other day, just sold them and bought 1000 AMC shares on BitFunder instead. Those AMC shares are dirt cheap at the moment.

As you can see it makes no mention of power consumption, never mind initial power consumption. It's an ambiguous bet because "advertised performance" could mean different things to different people, which was clearly the case as seen in the comments on the bet page. As pointed out in the bitcoin forum thread, according to BitBet's FAQ, this was a bad bet and never should have been allowed in the first place.
Also, as you can see from the forum thread, kakobrekla states that he made his decision based on the initial spec stated in a forum post in 2012. As pointed out by mabsark, by the time the bet was created (30-03-2013), it had already been posted in the same forum that the initial power consumption spec had changed.
kakobrekla also stated that they discussed this on an IRC channel, yet they conveniently never bothered to inform their users that they would be including power consumption in the bet, therefore they purposely misled their user.
And then theirs the allegation that BitBet actually bet 20 BTC on a "no" outcome. Now if that turns out to be true then they're proper shady.
The outcome was both "yes" and "no" in my opinion because the bet was totally ambiguous. The bet never should have been allowed. Instead of resolving the bet, it clearly should have been cancelled according to their own policy as stated in the FAQ.

Why not? Both physical and mental labour is becoming more and more automated as technology progresses. The logical conclusion being that unemployment will rise and so will unemployment benefits.

Direct democracy is completely different. In a direct democracy, everyone has an equal say and has equal political power. It is not simply majority rules as you suggest. That's only one form of vote available, another is consensus (100% of the vote). Voting itself is only a part of direct democracy, the main part is being able to participate in the process which produces the ideas to vote for.

You're making assumptions about the system again. I never described where the private keys came from or who controls them, you're just assuming that the private keys are in the voter's possession.
In the transaction I previously described, the voters private key could be generated at the moment the voter makes a decision and discarded after being used for the transaction. If we assume that these votes are presented on a centralised website, then that website would be responsible for ensuring that each account was eligible to vote, could only vote once per issue and would generate the private keys for voters as they made their decisions. Such a voting website would not need to log which account had used which private keys in order to restrict the vote to one vote per issue. It would simply need to record the fact that the user voted on that issue.
In such a system, the ballot is clearly secret. You can claim that such and such is vulnerable to such and such attack, but until you show exactly how that is the case, it's just hot air. If you think the above system would not be adequate to maintain a secret ballot, then please show how in a step by step manner.

The only competitors to AM that have shipped anything are Avalon and BFL. Avalon ASICs are also poor value though, so that just leaves BFL, which as you say have many back orders. That does not change the fact though that they have actually shipped hundreds of orders which people are mining on right now. Nor does it change the specifications of the device. 
So yes, without a doubt, AM hardware is extremely poor value compared to BFL hardware for those who actually have such hardware.


First day BFL Jalapenos are already making a profit. In fact, those Jalapenos have made more profit from mining than AM IPO shares have from dividends. That's a FACT.


So, how much will people pay for a 336 Mh/s USB Erupter when then can get a 5 GH/s BFL for 2.74 BTC? Will they pay 1 BTC? Not a chance. At the point, a fair price for the USB Erupter would be 0.2 BTC. A fair price for the 10 Gh/s Blades at that point would be 5.5 BTC.
So, with USB Erupters going for 0.2 BTC, Blades going for 5.5 BTC and plenty of competition available on the shelves, what do you think will happen to income from hardware sales?
Also, with lot's of competition pumping out hardware and AM needing to maintain their network share, there will be less hardware actually available for sale in the first place.


No it doesn't. The value of the hardware does not change the specifications of the hardware. AM and Avalon are weak compared to BFL simply because they're using older technology, 130nm and 110 nm compared to 65nm. And BFL's chips are not particularly good either. Compare BFL to BitFury and BFL looks just as weak as AM and Avalon. That will probably change when AM and Avalon produce their 55nm chips, but remains to be seen.
AM basically currently have a monopoly, but it's ending, and will be over in a couple of months. At that point, the share price will fall because dividends will decrease as both income from mining and hardware sales decrease.

I believe that 4 months is a pretty fair estimate. The first pre-order batch from KnC is sold out and systems based on Avalon chips should become available around August/September and will likely have their own back orders to deal with and they won't provide as much hashing power.
So, BFL is probably the quickest option at this point, unless you buy from an overpriced auction, and will allow for reinvesting into new devices as the mining proceeds allow and the devices become available.

What socialists object to, is capitalists receiving all the profits while doing none of the work.

Cold storage does not mean paper wallet. Cold storage simply means a wallet meant for long term storage. A strongly encrypted wallet will remain secure no matter who has access to it.
Personally, I wouldn't trust anyone to store my cold wallet unless I had created and encrypted that wallet myself. That's what's truly important, whereas the place of storage is pretty irrelevant.
A lot of people here clearly think that cryptography is too insecure to keep their bitcoins safe, which is the height of insanity considering that Bitcoin relies on cryptography.
Let me make this perfectly clear to such people. If cryptography is not good enough to secure your wallet, then the bitcoin protocol is doomed.

It doesn't matter if someone steals your wallet file if they cannot access the contents, which they can't do if the wallet is securely encrypted.
Why store the wallet in multiple places? So you always have access to it. If you only have 1 copy of your wallet and it's damaged or destroyed, you've lost your bitcoins. If it's stored in multiple places and one copy is damaged, destroyed or becomes inaccessible for some reason, you still have multiple backups and therefore your bitcoins.

You're probably going to be replied to by a load of trolls talking nonsense. Here are the facts.
People have waited almost a year for their devices because the devices did not exist at the time they were ordered. A few devices have been shipped but they're still being tweaked at the moment. If you order now, you will definitely have to wait a number of months. BFL say 2+ months, the trolls say 6 months to never.
The time it takes to mine a block is not fixed, it could take 10 seconds or 100 hours. You wont want to solo mine with a 5 Gh/s device though. 
Are BFL reliable? Not when it comes to sticking to their production schedule.
As for how much you'd earn with a 5Gh/s device, that depends on the network hash rate at the time you receive your device. At 1000 Th/s, a 5 Gh/s device will get you 0.018 BTC per day. It's unlikely that the network hash rate will reach 1000 Th/s this year.
You're just going to get many conflicting answers regarding BFL. You're going to have to do your own research and come to your own conclusions. If I was you, I'd buy one. I'd also try to buy shares in some of the mining companies as well. There's no need to be an idiotic fanboy and put all your eggs in one basket.

Social democracy, socialism, communism, transhumanism and the technological singularity.
I think it's unfair for the majority to be forced to serve the will of the minority, therefore I support direct democracy over the Internet. I believe this could be achieved without violent revolution by voting for a party running on the platform of providing direct democracy.
I also think it's extremely unfair that the owners of the means of production should be able to keep the majority of the value produced by the operators of those means of production, simply because they happened to have a large amount of money to spare in the first place.
I believe that unemployment is going to rise as technology automates production and services, for example, driverless vehicles will have a major impact on the transport industry. The only way capitalism can deal with this is to bribe the unemployed with safety nets in order to stop them from revolting, but that can't go on forever.
Socialism is far better equipped to deal with the technological unemployment problem. Under socialism, the workers of a company become the shareholders instead of a bunch of people who do no work at all related to that company. This means they would see vastly increased wages, which means they wouldn't have to work as many hours to receive a wage they can live off, which means more people could be employed.
Now look at 3D printing. It's basically a little portable factory that everyone could have in their home to produce various goods. Now compare these 3D printers to molecular assembler technology. This is like comparing a calculator to a state of the art PC. We've just created a basic molecular assembler and in a couple of decades we'll have our Star Trek replicators. At that point, wealth becomes obsolete.
Communism is simply an inevitability. It's just a matter of technological progress and time.
Now consider brain simulation. A fair bit of progress is being made in this field and the experts reckon we'll have a fully simulated human brain by 2050. This is the beginning of the end of humanity. From that point on, we'll start to transition to digital beings that are immortal and can take on any physical form they desire. They'll be able to form networked collectives, replicate themselves, and spread throughout the universe.

Because those systems are based on Stalin's ideas, not Marx's ideas. Marx was pretty damn clear and specific that socialism begins with direct democracy. How many of those supposed implementations of Marx's ideas began with direct democracy?


The State is an elite group in charge of governing the country and there is no elite group when everyone is an equal member of the government as in a direct democracy. What happens then?
@_date: 2013-05-27 13:25:06


And those laws, rights and acknowledgements could only come about by the community having a discussion, hence direct democracy.


Which again, would be engaging direct democracy.


That's basically an argument I've made myself many times to how decisions would be made. That is a clear example of direct democracy.


Except for those who are also experts in the area. Those expert would discuss the idea and the occasional lay person would chip in. They would hash out the flaws, and tweak the idea to make it better. Again, direct democracy.


What? You've just spent a good few paragraphs showing that people are bound by the decisions of the group, basically saying that if they don't like the rules, they can get out or not join in the first place. The same would be true of a socialist or communist city.


So, I create a law set, and submit it to some database of law sets which I assume would be online. Then others come along and pick the law set they want, like they were renting a movie? Do you not see the many problems inherent in that? First of all, most people don't have such aligned interests, and would only agree with a couple of laws in one set and a few laws from other sets. Secondly, how are people you come into contact and interact with supposed to know your specific laws? Do you constantly transit at people in your proximity? How do you think that's going to work out in a large city. There would simply be too much information for people to handle.


No, it's nothing like that at all, as I've just shown. The picture you painted above is just unworkable, impractical, inefficient and just plain silly when you look at the details.


What if they're not on any property and just in the city in general. Are you now contradicting yourself by claiming that the city has no rules that people need to abide by. Is it perfectly fine for to mug you outside your property? How about if we are both on some else's property and they don't have a law regarding me beating you? Is that ok as well? Of course there's going to be conflicts, to claim otherwise is not only delusional but extremely arrogant as well.


What if they don't use the road at all?


You just claimed there couldn't be any conflicts. How can you not understand that those dispute resolution procedures are yet another example of direct democracy?


I've already pointed out a couple of the flaws with you "law-set" idea.


But it wouldn't work and I've already explained why. The only way to establish community rules, is for the community to discuss amongst its members and decide upon a set of rules. Your way is simply forcing the will of a single person on the whole of the community. That's a dictatorship.


Again, do laws not exist when not on a persons property?


You've already stated that you're perfectly fine with consensus decision making which is a form of voting available in a direct democracy. And you're perfectly fine with collective discussion which is the core of direct democracy. Why then would you claim to be against direct democracy which is both those things in one package?


The decision making is with the individual in direct democracy. It's a simple fact of reality though, that people can't have everything they want so compromises need to be made. These compromises are made though discussion, through direct democracy.


In a direct democracy, people have 100% say in everything. They wont get everything they want though, because that simply isn't possible in any society as there will always be compromises which need to made.




There would be no elections whatsoever in a direct democracy. People would propose ideas directly. Those ideas would get discussed, refined, and abandoned or accepted as society wishes. Don't like those rules, then you're free to leave, just like in your society. 








That's not direct democracy, that's majority rules, I've already explained this to you. Direct democracy != majority rules. Majority rules is simply one form of voting which would be available, consensus is another form. Why do you assume majority rules and not consensus? Why not 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or any other percent for that matter?


Under consensus, X law wouldn't be passed until everyone agreed with it. It more likely that the proposal would be modified until agreement could be reached.
The idea of everyone having their own individual laws is just completely silly and would cause society to collapse. Nobody would know what laws apply to what people so they'd be constantly breaking laws and settling such disputes which arise. You need rules which apply to the whole of society so that people know what they can and can't do within that society.

In the bitcoin-qt client, click "Help", then "Debug Window", then select the "Console" tab. This will allow you to use the RPC API.
You could start with the following command:
listunspent [minconf=1] [maxconf=9999999] ["address",...]
Returns array of unspent transaction outputs with between minconf and maxconf (inclusive) confirmations. Optionally filtered to only include txouts paid to specified addresses. Results are an array of Objects, each of which has: {txid, vout, scriptPubKey, amount, confirmations}.
This would build up a list of unspent transactions for every address in our wallet. You would then look through that list for dust and create a 2 new lists, one containing dust transactions and the other containing non-dust transactions.
You could then use:
createrawtransaction [{"txid":txid,"vout":n},...] {address:amount,...}
Create a transaction spending given inputs (array of objects containing transaction id and output number), sending to given address(es). Returns hex-encoded raw transaction. Note that the transaction's inputs are not signed, and it is not stored in the wallet or transmitted to the network.
You would use the values from a non-dust unspent transaction and the value from a few dust tansactions, for example:
createrawtransaction [{"txid":NONDUSTTXID,"vout":NONDUSTVOUT},{"txid":DUST1TXID,"vout":DUST1VOUT},{"txid":DUST2TXID,"vout":DUST2VOUT}] {NewAddress:NONDUSTAMOUNT+DUST1AMOUNT+DUST2AMOUNT}
You would then remove the used dust transactions from the list. I'm not sure on the next part. I think you have to sign the transaction before you send it, and I'm not exactly sure how?
signrawtransaction &lt;hex string&gt; [{"txid":txid,"vout":n,"scriptPubKey":hex,"redeemScript":hex},...] [&lt;privatekey1&gt;,...] [sighashtype="ALL"]
Sign inputs for raw transaction (serialized, hex-encoded). Second optional argument (may be null) is an array of previous transaction outputs that this transaction depends on but may not yet be in the block chain. Third optional argument (may be null) is an array of base58-encoded private keys that, if given, will be the only keys used to sign the transaction. Fourth optional argument is a string that is one of six values; ALL, NONE, SINGLE or ALL|ANYONECANPAY, NONE|ANYONECANPAY, SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY. Returns json object with keys:
hex : raw transaction with signature(s) (hex-encoded string)
complete : 1 if transaction has a complete set of signature (0 if not)
requires wallet passphrase to be set with walletpassphrase first
So, you'd take the output from createrawtransaction and use it as the input for signrawtransaction (along with he private keys of the addresses in the transactions?).
With the raw transaction created, you can then send it to the network using:
sendrawtransaction &lt;hex string&gt;
Submits raw transaction (serialized, hex-encoded) to local node and network.
Now you would go back to the part where you create a raw transaction and repeat until you have no dust left.

Lets look at some numbers.
1,000 TH/s / 5 GH/s = 200,000  
65.031 TH/s / 300 MH/s = 216770  
65.031 TH/s / 350 MH/s = 185,802.857143
So, if the total hashpower was 1 PH/s and you had a 5 GH/s miner, you'd have about the same percentage of hash power as someone currently mining with an HD6870 or similar card (5830/5850).
As someone currently mining on an HD6870, I make around 0.1 BTC per week.
I also ordered one of those 5 GH/s BFLs. I don't worry about whether it'll pay for itself though as my 6870 has already paid for it. It just needs to cover it's electricity costs.

You need to stop paying attention to the BFL trolls. None of us know how long it will take for BFL to ship their ASICs. [BFL say that if you buy now, it will ship in 2 months though](
As for the difficulty, my calculations were based on a network hash of 1000 Th/s and a bitcoin price of $100. At the moment the network hash rate is 71 Th/s. So, if difficulty increases by 14x, it will take a 5 Gh/s miner around 30 weeks to make 3 BTC. At the current difficulty, it would only take 2 weeks to mine 3.5 BTC.
Sure, you could day trade and increase your BTC. You could also lose it all. Also, there's nothing stopping you from day trading with the BTC you mined.

I know what the phrase means. I don't know why you think it would apply here though.
You can claim that purchasing a mining device and buying shares which equate to a specified hashing power are somehow different, but they're not. At the end of the day, in both cases you are buying hashing power.
How is that anything like buying some tools to perform physical labour and buying shares in a company which provides the finished product of that labour? In one case you simply have some tools which will turn to rust. In the other case, you will receive a regular income from the share.
The examples are not similar in any way, shape or form. Your example is the actual red herring.

Stop making assumptions about me and my situation.
As for mining LTC being 3x more profitable. That's wrong according to the math.
An HD6870 get about 320-350 kH/s which makes about 0.9 LTC per day according to the calculators. According to Vircurex, 1 LTC = 0.0238 BTC.
0.9 * 7 = 6.3 LTC per week
6.3 * 0.0238 = 0.14994 BTC per week
At the next difficulty change, the number of LTC per day drops to 0.75 and he BTC per week to 0.125 BTC. According to BTC mining calculators, 300 MH/s = 0.12 BTC per week and 350 MH/s = 0.14 BTC per week at current difficulty, which has just seen an increase. If I would have been doing nothing but mining 24/7, I would have likely earned around 1.5 BTC in the past week.
So no, LTC are not 3x more profitable.

What I know for certain is that I paid 1.6 BTC (including shipping) for a 5 Gh/s miner on the 10th of April. With a network hashrate of 1000 Th/s, a 5 Gh/s miner will make 0.018 BTC per day and take 89 days to recover the cost. I will have my device way before the network hash rate reaches 1000 Th/s. It'll probably take me about a month to recover my costs after I get my device.

Like I said, if you don't trust in cryptography to keep your wallet safe, then why are you holding bitcoins which rely on cryptography to keep them safe and secure?
Strong encryption is far more secure than the most secure bank vault, never mind some cheap household safe. If you disagree with that, then you really shouldn't be holding bitcoins.

I ordered a Jalapeno in April and it cost me 1.6 BTC. At that price, if it ships this year it will make more profit than a 5 Gh/s AM Mini Blade (10 BTC) ordered today.
People who ordered in April are pretty damn lucky and actually got a good bargain.

They also have a custom fab business. For example, they'll be making [14nm Altera FPGAs next year](

I agree as well that it'll happen eventually, I just don't see it happening any time soon. There's simply not enough players in the game and those that are in the game simply don't have the capacity to ship that much hashing power in a month. Even with a load of companies selling ASICs, they'd still be limited by what the fabs could produce.


I thought you were saying that someone like AMD was maing them or something. Those systems eat up huge quantities of chips, and those chip are in limited supply.


If they can't ship that many, then the hash rate can't increase that fast. They didn't have a product to ship before, now they do. It's a different ballgame. Maybe they can't ship 400 a day, we'll find out soon enough though.

I haven't once insulted you for disagreeing with me. At one point, I claimed your argument that performing tyrannous acts is tyranny under socialism was pathetic, which it was. Stating the obvious when it's completely irrelevant to try and score points is pathetic and lazy. Was that an insult towards you or a criticism of your argument?
In a later comment, I told you that if you insist on deliberately misrepresenting socialism and communism after repeatedly being corrected on your misuse, then I may start using that tactic against you. Again, is that an insult, or is it criticism of your tactic of spreading pure lies about socialism and communism and trying to pass them off as fact. 
It's like we're having a discussion and you keep making up random words just to stump me.


Did I ask for guns or run of the place. See what I mean? You just can't refrain from spreading bullshit can you?
I will again ask you the questions I initially asked.
Does taking part in reddit discussions lead to tyranny?
Does voting on reddit lead to tyranny?
Does working for yourself or a few peers lead to tyranny?
If none of these things lead to tyranny, why would socialism?
This time, do you think you could actually answer the questions instead of trying to palm me off with something as retarded, pathetic and lazy as "tyrannous acts are tyrannous, herp, derp".

I'm not very good at explaining things. You'd be better off just reading the thread on the forum.
They have capital from sales of purchasing. Any capital left after 400 days of mining dividends at the new rate is paid as dividends for SELLING. Or something like that.

If you spend that 10 BTC on DMS.SELLING right now you could buy about 322 shares. It's going to pay a nice dividend tomorrow or Friday of between 0.006 and 0.01 BTC per share. So, if you spend that 10 BTC right now on DMS.SELLING, by Saturday you will have earned 2-3.5 BTC.
Difficulty is going to see some pretty big increases over the next few rounds and DMS.SELLING will see similar dividends for those as well.

There's also about 200 TH/s coming from 100TH (104 TH/s for share holders, 44 Th/s for Metabank and 52 for them to use as they please). The 104 Th/s should be online by August, the 44 Th/s from Metabank should be shipped August - October.
There's also KnCminer which is supposed to be shipping September/October for the 500 pre-orders. They have 2 devices, 175 Gh/s and 250 Gh/s. If it's 500 pre-orders for each type then that's 212.5 Th/s. If those 500 pre-orders include both devices, then that's a minimum of 87.5 Th/s and a maximum of 125 Th/s.

Could bitcoin miners make any profit if bitcoin wasn't created?

is4k did in the title.


By posting here, the poster is completely ignoring the rules of the sub:


The article has nothing to do with bitcoin. So, the whole thread is a joke and my comments rightfully treat it as such.

I've no idea what you are trying to get at. Nobody refers to precious metals as bitcoins. So, what are talking about?
I know what the OP meant with the title, I'm just taking the piss because he never should have posted it here in the first place as it's against the community rules. There's no relationship between bitcoins and precious metals.

I'm not aware of it being used in such a way at the moment, but I've seen it discussed on reddit and the bitcoin forums a few times.

What if it were in their purse which was lost in the accident? It's easy to plan for situations you expect, it's the unexpected situations which get people every time.
You cannot predict the future, so let's not pretend you can. There's plenty of situations which could arise which places the control of paper wallets into hands of others. For example, say your mother and father split up, and your mother meets a new bloke who she bring home. The guy just happens to stumble across your paper wallet and recognises it for what it is and takes a picture of it as to not arouse suspicion.
I can come up with situations all day where you lose your bitcoins due to not securing your paper wallet. Can you come up with a single situation in which I'd lose the coins from my encrypted wallet which is stored in multiple locations on the Internet?

So, Theymos, when will you be banning all the other trolls? The trolls that I actually know of because they troll so fucking much. Banned for trolling, my arse! You banned him because you don't like him, otherwise half your forum members would be getting banned.
Theymos, you've proven yourself to be an idiotic, scummy piece of shit who cannot be trusted. Enjoy all the stolen donations and censoring speech.
