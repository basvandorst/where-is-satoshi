just curious, what do you think we've made in the last 100 years that compares to the sistine chapel, for instance?
in terms of tech and medicine we're obviously moving forward but in terms of culture i dont think many people would dispute we're going backwards

mathmatics is a hard science. if i say 2 + 2 = 4 that can be proven or disproven. if i say "this painting of a sunflower is pretty" no one can tell me its not
the LOTR, which i love, is nothing compared to Paradise Lost, or the King James Bible. And the LOTR is the strongest work among those you just named

i never said fiction, i said literature. there's a difference
if you're seriously critiquing the KJ version of the bible as being poorly written then you're just a moron. the choice of language is what makes it special, not the story it tells, and it is very well written
if i say that we're leap years ahead in math now than we were in the 1500's, it still has nothing to do with my original point, it only addresses a side-avenue that you're trying to force the conversation down. if you dont want to talk about what i said, i invite you to stop talking and do something else

i think saying hello to a client and telling a client about how money is a scam propagated by the federal reserve are 2 different things.

you're side stepping my question and you know it
what painting, piece of sculpture, piece of literature, etc do you think we've produced in the last 50 years that favorably compares with the top works of the 1400's-1700's?
yes, we're ahead in some areas, i said that already, but mathmatical theorems are not culture-specific and you know that i'm sure

why is "our clients" in quotes here? you worked for the company, right? their clients weren't your clients or what's the issue?
