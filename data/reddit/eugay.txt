There are two issues with Lightning.
1. The path to the recipient needs to consist of channels with a lot of liquidity so when people transfer a larger amount of money the transaction can succeed.
2. If your counterparty commits an old state of your channel to the blockchain (where they had more money), you need to react quickly enough and commit a newer state to the network. If your software is offline, you will lose money. If you manage to do it, they will lose their portion of the channel's money, provided their share is not nil. The channel thus needs to be run and monitored by a machine which is online 100% of the time and has a lot of liquidity.
Both of these lead to centralization around major hubs which will be collecting fees. Whether you're okay with it or not is up to you.

The reason why your node can't go offline is you stand to lose money if your channel's counterparty submits an old channel state to the network (and you, being offline, don't submit a newer one in time).

I'm not up to date, is there a way to transfer $1 for a fee of $0.02 now in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-06 07:27:03
No, they don't. Blockchain is a single-page web app. They can even disable the delay mobile web browsers impose on links, waiting for doubletaps. It's going to feel like a native app if they do that and use iOS's add-to-homescreen feature.
@_date: 2014-01-06 01:20:51
Great. Blockchain has an app in the Mac app store - signed and sandboxed. 
Multibit and others don't come signed which is a real bummer as it encourages bad practice of opening unsigned bitcoin apps.

Hey genius, the crimean crisis started half a year ago. Now see why I chose 6 months?

ITT perfect examples of how delusional users can be.

An HTML5 webapp will work okay for blokchain.info. You'd be surprised, just visit  from Safari on iOS and add it to your home screen. It works basically like a native app does, and since both weather forecasts and blockchain.info require an internet connection to work, I don't care whether it comes from the app store or the web.
Security would be greater if it was a native app though, since in case of a security breach on blockchain.info, an attacker wouldn't be able to change the app's code.

Okay then, how would that be different from the current credit card processors? Eventually the market would leave only a few big ones supported by the majority of retailers, no?
@_date: 2014-11-28 00:37:20
They better! it's not like Bitcoin lost 50% of its value in the past 6 months. Right?

You'll be thrilled to know they're moving production of the batteries to the US. Besides, there's a lot to love about them other than impact on the environment.

O hey we hate blockchain now? I'm a bit out of the loop, what happened?
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:20:51
$0-0.15 national, $0-$2 within the EU

Isn't energy the cheapest where it is also the dirtiest/most polluting? That can't be good.

How about 150 million $1 transactions? As it currently stands, you’ll end up spending $30 million on bitcoin fees.

Actually, on ethereum, due to the way the blockchain is structured, full nodes do not need to download the full history - it contains a lot of unnecessary, intermediate, stale state information. 
Here's more info:

Why is it zero, smartypants?

Altcoins have completely separate chains. BCH is not an altcoin because it forked off Bitcoin's chain. People who have vested interest in BTC winning over BCH use that argument in hope that people who had enough of their koolaid (or who have similar vested interests) will eat it right up and spread their marketing spiel. Seems to be working. 
As a person who doesn't care about which chain ends up  winning I suggest you reevaluate your views objectively.
@_date: 2017-09-11 01:55:22
I mean, BCH clearly says they are Bitcoin *Cash*, not just "Bitcoin" or bitcoin2, so I think the hostility is unwarranted, but successfully stirred up by BTC to divide the community.

Wow. Seriously. This is ridiculous. Thanks for the link.

As a noob, what happens when I send somebody the money for bitcoins but they never mark it as received on bitcoin.de? Do you trasnfer the bitcoins anyway when the buyer shows a proof of transfer? If so, what if the proof is fake?

Well, PayPass is very handy. That's what made ccs popular in my country. Do you live in Germany by chance?

Why are these shitty tactics? It's great. If people from eastern EU were to pay the same amount od money as westerners do, Spotify wouldn't be as popular as it is. They earn so much less.

Wait, what is going on in Hamburg? Should I go as well?

Does that mean somebody is pumping it?

Plus, theoretically, if someone generated the same random address as you (so that both of you would have the private key for such an address), you could both spend the coins.
It's highly unlikely, but I found it quite shocking when I first found out. :)

And it didn't occur to you that people In Europe don't perceive guns as a necessity simply because they have never seen one in real life, nor have they felt threatened enough to get one as no one else posesses them?
But if I lived in the US, yes, I think I'd like one.

The choice of node.js is difficult for me to understand. But I'm biased since I love C so much.

They also have a signed and sandboxed (as required by Apple) app in the Mac App Store. Is is even safer?
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:48:49
Hey! Can I ask why is OS X regarded as less safe than Linux? I'd say its sandboxing of apps and only running signed apps by default are some pretty neat features.
By the way, Electrum doesn't come signed for OS X. Seems like a big omission.
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:07:05
If you download an app before it's deleted from the App Store, you can use it as long as you want.
@_date: 2013-11-10 10:01:10
Hey, what is your operating system? I'm wondering what's the chance of getting hacked on OS X. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 09:04:45
Yeah, but even then, if each transaction gets a new address, they could only prove tax avoidance for a tiny amount of transactions (ones which they know the addresses for).
