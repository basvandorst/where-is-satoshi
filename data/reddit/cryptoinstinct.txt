Not Wall st. But if you look at Gdax you can see someone putting big bitcoin sell orders(40+ BTC) then when the price drops a good few hundred out because of panic sellers a big bitcoin buy order comes. Looks like they're just repeating it over and over and it's working

Most exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini, Paypal, or anything related have a fast bank verification that they can do by selecting your bank from a drop down list or searching it and when you do you can use your bank info to login and it will see that you got a "Success" from logging in and automatically verify it. 
You could do it the slower way where they deposit 2 small amounts to your account but I would do the faster way.

They're just not allowing you to buy bitcoin with a credit card, big whoop. Shouldn't spend money you don't have on bitcoin anyways.

Well I got the automated response reply, but after that it took about 2 weeks. Could be 1.5 weeks, Also I'm not saying CB gave me money back, I'm saying I made a dispute through my card because CB wouldn't reply.

Pretty much, someone got ahold of my CC info somehow. (Luckily it was a preapaid card) but  they used $800 out of the $1000 on it. I contacted coinbase to notify them that someone just purchased $800 worth within 10 minutes of the purchase, (Usually takes a while to verify) they didn't take any action and replied 2 weeks later.
I got my $800 back though. Took about 3 months for the dispute to be done since prepaid card companies are slow
