At least dont repeat the same mistake twice.  Maybe wait for BCH to pick up a little bit before u sell it into BTC so you dont sell at the bottom and buy at the top all over again

This is super cool.

Switch bank.  They work for you, not the other way around. Fck em.

Only point there was what the cost of a big event such as a war or a financial crash may come in many forms, and might be way more expensive than money.  This all depends on your understanding of what is voluntary and to what extent people are willing to go on.

It´s an interesting point.  Maybe it just depends upon if enough Big Money have been persuaded to go into crypto instead of for example gold and silver.

I completely agree. BTC is going to take a sizeable bite out of that 8 trillion dollar market cap and, if nothing else, we´ll see tremendeous growth in price from that alone.  I believe more and more of the hardcore Gold community will warm and switch to BTC as they see the price going up and learn more about it too.

My conclusion on this thus far is that stock market fear is very good for BTC price, but stock market crash might not be.
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:17:39
This is true to a certain extent.  Much of the rise in gold price came between 2009-2012 when the American economy experienced allot of recovery (not for the middle class obviously, but more so WallStreet).  Maybe it was a delayed reaction to the 2008 crash.  It does make allot of sense and no doubt that one had something to do with the other.  Off course this hedge is nothing new.

Be nice to people on your way up, because you´ll meet them on your way down.  I think it would be good for the entire community if we could keep this whole fork-fight as civil as possible, and stop gloating over the fact that Bcash is doing poorly and Bitcoin is doing well.  It does not matter how much BTC or how little BTC someone has.  We can all try our best to treat each other with respect either way.  This fork is a result of a completely free market.  I did not care for it much, but was happy with the way it has worked out so far.

Yup, know a great deal about it.  Complex stuff, but one of the biggest issues was that they gave out loans to high risk customers who had no chance at paying down the loan with the insane interst rates they got, and then they packaged all these loans together into big mortage derivatives, got standard&amp;Poor or moodys to give them a better rating than they deserved, and sold them off to some other sucker bank as fast as possible untill that ticking timebomb exploded.  Thats some of the story.

Agree.  I don´t think it would be a huge problem for an exchange like Coinbase to offer solutions for problems like this one.  The bigger challenge is to find a decentralized solution if at all possible.  Just thinking out loud here, but I believe one solution would be to have some sort of service that notifies the person who will inherit from you with all necessary info to access your funds.  Say that this message will be sent if you are inactive with your funds for over 5 months.  If the app gave you plenty of notifications in the weeks leading up to the fifth month, you would have plenty of time to stop the message transfer if you happened to take a long vacation or somehow did not check in with your Bitcoin for close to half a year.  There are probably plenty of security issues with this, but some solution should be possible to figure out.

Do I get a discount if I pay you in BTC? Like 50% off?
@_date: 2017-07-10 05:41:01
As you explain, it is easy to see the direct use for BTC and LTC, Ethereum is being used for ICOs now.  Sure, it might get way bigger than BTC and LTC, but apart from ICOs, ETH is promising everything and focusing on nothing as far as I can see.  I probably need to read more up on ETH.
But in regards to picking winners and losers I have seen and heard of many times where the better product lost.  In the 80s, Beta lost to VHS (Beta had better picture quality).  
@_date: 2017-07-12 13:43:53
Yup, it´s probably not dead.  Just seems to be a thing to say, every time it drops a bit.

Lol.  That answer is about as good as the question.  Thanks.
@_date: 2017-07-12 11:36:28
I find the title of the article missleading.  Very clickbaity.  
@_date: 2017-07-12 04:26:37
Most likely three reasons;
01. The protocol is being upgraded to segwit august 1.  Lots of people are afraid that this might lead to a hard fork, causing Bitcoin to split into two different coins, operating on separate blockchains.  If this happens, both sides will lose value.  So many want to get out of BTC before august to be on the safe side.
02. The whole cryptoverse has been in a bubble for the past months, with great help from plenty of phony ICOs.  People have been throwing their money at this, expecting it to rise higher and higher.  Many of the short term speculators are now seing that BTC and others have been slow in growth for the past weeks.  People get impatient, afraid of a dip in price, and everyone starts selling.
03. The Mt.Gox trail. This is probably, if at all, the smallest reason why BTC and others drop in price.  I do believe it will affect the price in some small negative way.  Especially for newcomers who do not understand the difference between holding BTC for them selves, versus having it stored on an exchange.  But in short, the CEO of the Mt.Gox exchange manipulated the price increase of BTC in 2013, buy faking purchases of hundreds of thousands of BTC to his own accounts.  Thing is he didn´t buy the coins, he stole them from customers. 
This causes insecurity "Is my money safe?", "can I trust any of the exchanges at all?" etc etc.
As always, with great rewards comes great risk.  If you have appetite for the risky nature of this market you might just do all right.
@_date: 2017-07-10 16:19:17
this is true.
@_date: 2017-07-10 06:29:18
True.  So do some Research, make some decisions and hodl I guess
@_date: 2017-07-12 10:02:21
20 LTC, you say?
@_date: 2017-07-10 11:15:17
1 trillion Venezuelan Bolivar maybe. :)

Invest your Bitcoin in Litecoin (Full disclosure, I hold Litecoin and mostly want u to invest in it to help drive up the price)
