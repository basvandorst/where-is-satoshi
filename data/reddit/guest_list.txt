As someone who trades futures, i called my trading feed (cmegroup) and they said you’re only buying the price of bitcoin and you will not actually possess a bitcoin. Just the price

i was waiting for a dip since 10k it finally came after it hit 19k luckily i got fomo and just bought little bits here and there along the way. i think my last buy was at 13.8 not mad at all
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:31:09
Trading futures you are only trading the price of bitcoin. You don’t actual own or buy bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:33
yup I talked to my cousin about it yesterday he ended up getting in at 14000 last night and this morning is mad at me because he didn't buy more

aren't you the guy that got banned from and made that fake video betting 300k on apple earnings?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:35:52
why not sell 25%?
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:14:18

@_date: 2017-12-08 14:37:00
my cousin is skeptical about it and after its 4k rally yesterday it dropped 2k (but was still up 2K from the previous day) "its crashing!"
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:48:57
Had to downvote your first comment for your error
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:49:45
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:34:16
yeah man then go for it
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:25:04
If you can survive a bitcoin dip you can survive cancer! Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:16:46
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:22:00
No because there’s limits to how much you can buy at a time. With a debit card you can only invest $750 per week and a wire transfer you can only invest 5000-10000 per week but it takes like 3-4 days to go through. At least on coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:55:34
Not even 700 people. 700 contracts
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:09:06
I think it will just slow things down. I don’t think it will effect it negatively too much. Wall Street is just salty that we’re making money on it and they are not
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:06:37
If you sell it will go up. Do us all a favor and take one for the team

@_date: 2017-12-11 17:34:32
May not believe im a future trader. But i was right. The futures have not effected the price of bitcoin at all. Currently at 16.5
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:52:04
$250 so far waiting for a pull back to invest the remaining 1750
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:24:12
Got in at 9,600
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:56:14
God dam this is me. Been waiting over a week for a dip and it just won’t give it to me
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:16:11
I tried to get in at 2800 but couldn’t figure out how to buy it. Once it hit 8k i sat down and figured it out and waited for a dip. The dip never came so i bout a partial position at 10,100. Waiting for a dip before i put the rest of my postition in
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:55:28

This is the dotcom bubble of our generation. Ask anyone over 50 what their biggest regret is and they’ll tell you i wish i bought Apple at $23. Bitcoin is our Apple
