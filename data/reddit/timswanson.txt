Not that it matters, but since you're very interested in my life, both my wife and I work in San Jose and are currently visiting some friends in SF.  We were at the parade today: 
I still do not think that my history or background is relevant to the issues discussed in the slides.  They either stand on their own merits or do not.

Actually, I do not.  I make a distinction both in the report and slides that there are permissionless blockchains (such as Bitcoin) and permissioned blockchains.  I actually prefer using the term "shared, replicated ledger" because of the connotation surrounding blockchain (such as this very conversation).

See comment from An article from The core components of Bitcoin's blockchain:
    2001: SHA-256 finalized
    1999-present: Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT etc.)
    1999-present: P2P networks (excluding early networks like Usenet or FidoNet; MojoNation &amp; BitTorrent, Napster, Gnutella, eDonkey, Freenet, i2p etc.)
    1998: Wei Dai, B-money
    1997: HashCash; 19986: Nick Szabo, Bit Gold; ~2000: MojoNation/BitTorrent; ~2001-2003, Karma, etc
    1992-1993: Proof-of-work for spam
    1991: cryptographic timestamps
    1980: public key cryptography
    1979: Hash tree

This is not quite true.  If you read both the slides and paper, I make it clear that organizations, irrespective of their ideology, can create different types of shared, replicated ledgers to solve a variety of use-cases.  If you do not want to call it a blockchain, that is fine, I'm not trying to trademark that term.
In one scenario, banks can use known validators (called mintettes) that are legally accountable, to perform transaction verification.  Not a really novel idea actually, Ben Laurie discussed mintettes in his 2011 paper:

Hi Chris, wrote a whole report about it a couple months ago.  Page 4 &amp; 5 have a number of definitions you may be interested in:

What are any of our credentials?  Is there a certain probation period in which everyone must be gated through before they're allowed to do research on a specific topic?  (FWIW, this is one the reasons why newspapers like The Economist didn't put the author's name on an article for decades)
Either my arguments rest on their own or they do not.  Appealing to certifications or credentials is superficial.

So, an airplane?

I don't think you were actually present for any of the negotiations nor did you have access to the term sheet.  So I don't know how you can come to this conclusion.
As an aside, I think what bothers a lot of people is that I actually disclose my actual financial interests.  There are not many people in the cryptocurrency space (yet) that fully disclose their holdings in different assets, including internet commodities like virtual currencies.  I currently hold none nor do I have any trading positions open.

Is there a blockchain/distributed ledger degree program I am unaware of?  What's the right place to get a BS/MS in Blockchainology from?
And what does my background (or lackthereof) have to do with the slides:

The reddit goskino are on my case, this is good news for BINO.  Next, hopefully, we shall see an exposé on the Airbus A380, which is not a true aeroplane because the only true aeroplane's that can exist are wooden biplanes handcrafted by the Wright brothers themselves.

Hi, I am not a reporter or journalist.  I do research for a couple different organizations including SKBI in Singapore:

Steven, I respond to your post here:

I like this chart, very neat.  FWIW, we might not agree on conclusions but I do certainly appreciate the hard work you do with all your data sets/charts.
@_date: 2014-06-22 22:18:26
Hi, sure, I have a paper that discusses those numbers in detail: 
"Learning from Bitcoin’s past to improve its future" 
It concurs with what John noted in his article above, ~30%.

Great comment, really appreciate the feedback .  And you're absolutely right, this could be just a short-term issue related to boot-strapping.  I could even be interpreting the data incorrectly.  Thanks again for the info in the past, hope more solutions come to the market too.

Hi, is correct.  The one thing that ArtForz seems to have done first was scale with more than 2 GPUs and for a much longer period of time.  I've amended the post to include this update.

Hi guys, some good questions.
A lot of the consumer behavior we are seeing relates to (low) time preferences and expectations.  Recall that from a demographics stand point, most UTXO "owners" (individuals who have knowledge of a private key) are typically young men from developed countries with access to a number of payment systems.  Since these other payment systems fulfill most of their requirements for retail purchases and because they have an expectation that token prices will increase in the future, many owners are holding and not spending the tokens (note: if you look around in this article you may be able to find some slides that show some of the numbers I am referring to: 
But not all people who shop online are young men, correct?  If you look through this Stone Street Advisors deck (specifically starting at slide 33), you will see some of the challenges facing merchants like Overstock, namely that women represent the bulk customer base and as a variety of surveys have shown, female bitcoin owners are basically a rounding error: 
Reddit can probably come up with all sorts of hypothetical scenarios for when, why and how people with bitcoins will start spending tokens on a regular basis to fulfill retail orders, but this is unlikely to occur for those in developed countries since their payment systems are for the time being "good enough" relative to the frictions they currently need to go through in order to obtain, secure and spend virtual currencies.  Perhaps that will change in the future.
