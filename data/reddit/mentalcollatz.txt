It is missing perhaps the most useful defense: [salt](  The salt needs to be unique, but does not need to be a secret.  For example your email address works as a salt.

While I agree that he shouldn't be allowed to call Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core", does the argument not go both ways?  At the time of writing, 13 people in this thread have referred to Bitcoin Cash as "bcash", and no one has said "Hey everyone, its actually called Bitcoin Cash and the name bcash is inflammatory".  And if anyone did in this sub they would probably be downvoted to oblivion.
Note: I don't think they should be allowed to call themselves "Bitcoin Cash", because even that is too misleading.  But that ship has sailed.  Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash and we're stuck with it.  But if we demand consistency from them we should offer consistency back.

Yes, I found multiple attacks against the original implementations of multi-algo.  The groestl attack you mentioned wasn't specific to multi-algo, but the attacker was able to succeed with a moderately low hashrate because of multi-algo.  All known attacks have been patched in DGB and all but one have been patched in MYR (the outstanding attack is an obscure double-spending attack).  Both are also provably time-warp resistant.
Overall I'd say multi-algo has the potential to increase the security of the network against 51% attacks, but care must be taken in the implementation.  For example, deciding how much "work" a block contains becomes a non-trivial problem when multiple algorithms are involved.

If I hadn't been following this sub lately I would think that response was sarcasm.  "Miners don't decide consensus"?  Isn't the very definition of a soft fork a change in network rules caused by a *majority of miners* changing their block acceptance rules?  Why is this situation so different just because it's a hard fork instead of soft?  It seems like the difference is that with a soft fork people that disagree with the change are forced to go along, but with a hard fork people who disagree can choose not to accept it.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to defend S2X.  I think it's absolutely awful, but I don't understand this particular argument.
