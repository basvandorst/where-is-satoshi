Not claiming the fees is effectively the same thing, it is reducing the supply of bitcoins. eg. 
To think of it in a different way, pretend there is no block reward and 1 BTC of fees were used in transactions in a block.  If that 1 BTC is not claimed in the coinbase transaction, it's gone forever.

This is the smallest block reward in the 50btc era (48.24219931 BTC): 
This is the smallest block reward in the 25btc era (24.995 BTC): 
edit: This is by excluding fees, not by reducing the actual block reward

Having just launched a block explorer in beta, these tests have been great to stress test our system.  Still some more tweaking to be done.  Our mempool currently showing 23,000+ txs (20mb+)

Thanks for reporting this.  Can I ask what browser and screen resolution you are using?
Noted on the plural confirmations :)

Currently running 4 nodes, all of them have crashed today.  Quite frustrating having to baby sit them. Upgraded the servers they are on and it seems to be a bit better now (2gb -&gt; 4gb ram).

The Bitcoin consensus rules allow miners to give themselves less than the full block reward. We calculate the bitcoin supply by taking the actual reward amount - not by simply calculating based on block height.
This is a good example: 
You can see 2 transactions in this block that pay a 0.0005 BTC fee.  The miner has neglected to include this in their payout, thus only 49.999 BTC were created from this block.  There are many like this and it adds up to an odd amount.
