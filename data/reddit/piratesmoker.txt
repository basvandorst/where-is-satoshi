This is assuming BTC is "the future".  
It's not even the best technology today, let alone "in the future".  There's better coins, technically speaking, they just don't have the name recognition (or the capitalization, but that can change).

The "greater fool" has been shoveling fiat into the market for months, hoping to "catch the falling knife".  Where do you think all that fiat people are cashing out for is coming from?   And those in the know will continue to milk the greater fools, as long as they remain ("hurr durr muh cost averaging hurr") until the milk runs dry, and by then, all y'all "hodlers" will have left will be each others shoulders to cry on.

There's nothing BTC could do that you would not think is "good".

Nah.  It's going to be BITCOIN VS SUPERIOR CRYPTOCURRENCIES
What bitcoin has going for it is market cap, name recognition and momentum.    Which is a big deal, of course.
What it is NOT is, a superior technology.  There's better coins, technologically speaking.  There will certainly be better ones invented.  And one of the better ones is going to be the coin of the future... not the antique tech BTC represents.  
People can see the future, and crypto plays a part... but BTC?   Please.  BTC will be a shit coin before long and will never again reach its current all time high.  Heck, it'll never reach HALF it's all time high.  The smart money knows this... can see the writing on the wall, and are cashing out.
