You can set up a buy for as much as you like privately through localbitcoins. Just do the exchange with a reputable seller and you should be fine.

It's good for btc hodlers because it lowers the total supply and moves up the price fractionally. Their individual loss becomes everybody else's gain.

At the end of the day you are at the whim of the early adopters, scammers, mining company &amp; exchange operators who hold a good portion of the total btc that will ever exist (apart from satoshi himself who hasn't touched the 1M or so coins he owns).
As an early adopter I can say most of these people would sell their own mother down the river for a few extra satoshis. 
That said I think it should be enormously profitable to invest - these people are incredibly greedy - the won't kill the golden goose - just slice big chunks of it and wait for it to grow back. I believe it's probably going to 100k+ but it's gonna be a bumpy ride getting there. If you look at past performance it looks as though a buy and hold strategy over say 5 years would yield some pretty dramatic gains. **as long as you store your coins correctly**
Couple this with the fact that by design it doesn't lend itself well to traditional regulation you can see it's a high risk, high reward type proposition.

Dollar cost average is the way to go unless you're an actual pro trader or wanna get skinned alive.
