Hey,at least thats some funding for one of the most important sites about bitcoin for a start, but the foundation has to do MORE especially away from computer screens, forums, the "virtual world". Sitting at home waiting for a wonder to happen does not do the marketing. One has to go outside and tell everyday people in the real world about this new revolutionary innovative payment system in a NON TECHNICAL way (as paypal does in its ads). 
Its about time to start a simple marketing campaign of some kind by talking to businesses and people directly in different states, fitting them with some kind of "starter kit" including bitcoin/flyers and handouts for customers to take with them (a simple QR code with the merchants bitcoin address) and a link to a wallet app before leaving, recording customer and business feedback/problems with the payment system, learning from the mistakes and making the usage better and easier. If you dont know what the people want or why they dont use it yet,you will never fit the product to market and the bitcoin usage will experience growth even slower. It is essential for the whole project and cause to use the money for these kind of activities!

try using a tool to undelete files, maybe your wallet.dat file reappears,eg.  Remember to download and unzip the program onto an usb stick to keep the OS from overwriting stuff on your HD.
