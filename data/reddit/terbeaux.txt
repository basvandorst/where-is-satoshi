They did get back to me quickly. I opened my cryptsy account late last year when a different exchange went offline. I have only used it for MOON and TIPS. They f-ed up one of two withdrawals that I made. Statistically, they are 50% accurate with my withdrawals.
I also am generally superstitious of anything coming out of Florida. It seems to be either crime  or spam

Can you please get congress and senate to do the same thing so that we can see who slips in cash for the military in the farm budget?

I have a catch all domain. anything goes into a single email address. When I sign up for a new service I instantly create a new email address, in this case cyptsy If I start receiving spam directed at that email address then I know which site is responsible for leaking my email. An added benefit is that if someone hacks one site it is slightly more difficult to correlate my account data (e.g. secret questions) with a different service.
The downside is that all websites call me their own name.

This isn't anything specific to bitcoin or cryptocoins for me. If I used any service and had anything of value stored there and I logged in one day to find out that they had not accurately accounted for it then I would close the account, irregardnerlessly of whether or not it was cryptocurrency, meat from kingdom of loathing, or wowcraft gold.
