Sometimes paying a small amount is a worse incentive than not paying people at all.

You shouldn't use the same address again. It is not certain how coinbase will handle that. You also probably shouldn't trust mrtrch822 unless you know them.

Bad at presenting the facts of a case. Bad at mentioning important details and presenting a nuanced perspective. I have disliked articles from them that I agree with and that I disagree with (when it comes down to opinion pieces).

This money was from the website and unclaimed. They didn't steal it. They gave notice that it was confiscated and the owner could claim it (if they wanted to admit to running the silk road).

You could do a nash equilibrium situation where the host stakes as much as they are going to get paid and gives you the ability to return this stake or destroy it. You then release these funds as you download your data which would be broken up into chunks. That way there would be no financial incentive to rip and run. 
If they offered a partial refund (say for unused time/bandwidth) when cancellations happened then you would have no good reason to spite their nash stake. If you coupled this with host/customer reputation system it seems entirely possible (although pretty tricky to get right).
Asking a host to prove they still have files without downloading the whole thing is solvable as well. Say you want to store 10gb for 6 months and pay monthly. Before you upload the software could store 6 distinct hashes of the data + some random salt. Then at each payment time you provide the salt and ask for the hash. This way the host would have to keep the data. This coupled with the fact they wouldn't actually gain anything for pretending they are hosting it would mitigate a lot of the incentives to lie.
This kind of system doesn't come without its own problems.
All real profit would only be after each retrieval. Also hosts would need as much capital as they wanted to charge everyone or at least a large amount of 'dead' capital. This is an unusual economic requirement. Also the equilibrium would not require the host to provide you with /good/ service. They could still serve up your data at terrible speeds for example.

They have repeatedly told people here and elsewhere that offering more choices of payment methods actually cuts the amount of donations they get.
As such displaying it prominently would cost them a lot more than the tiny amount of fees they would save on the donations given with bitcoin.

Criminal is not a moral word. It is a legal one. Law referes how the state operates not how anyone thinks it should.
If you want to say it is wrong that people are arrested for taking drugs that is fine, but it is nonsensical to say it isn't illegal.

That doesn't apply to paying for illegal things though....

Not if the current price is based on speculation. Especially as I qualified growth as growth in use.

Why not just use larger amounts for coloured coins? Presumably when you 'sell' your stock or whatever you exchange it for their value + the (still tiny) value of the btc. I don't see the problem here?

There is no reason to think as many people need to use bitcoin as other currencies for it to be useful and have value though. So the value could be anything in between 0 and 100000 as well.
@_date: 2013-03-30 20:32:41
Sure it does you would just have to charge more. Either your rate needs to be higher than the rate of deflation or you pin the amount to a value in some other currency. Either has the same effect.

Alternatively you could ask, why don't you put **all** your money into bitcoins and then you would have to spend them if you wanted to spend any money.
The answer of course is that it currently seems far too risky. So actually it isn't the percentage increase that is the problem but the variance.

Ah ok. Well the price could stay at $120 even with some growth if it is currently above what it 'ought' to be for how many people are using it. Use could go up with speculation going down if you see what I mean.
