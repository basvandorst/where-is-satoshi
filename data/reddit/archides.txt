Well you'll have to ask individuals why each of them bought bitcoin. I didn't buy it to be a store of value. Although I know the value would go up, I bought hoping that it'd be cool to be able to use this stuff to transact, as it grew in adoption, no matter where I travelled. In my mind if it's not do that then why would want a currency you can't reasonably spend. So the value comes from the utility, and high fees/delays inhibit the utility, contrary to the first sentence of your first post. As fees increase, the less it is utilized by businesses, and the more places drop support for these reasons.

No, they won’t.

However in our case the population has the option of making the same purchase with much less costly means (by using fiat). So that can directly affect the demand for bitcoin.

I’m just saying I read it’s purpose,it’s properties, observed its adoption, and wanted to be a part of its growth. The two things you mentioned are both mentioned by Satoshi in his paper (electronic cash system, later in the paper he says it’s more akin to a precious metal given its limited supply).

@_date: 2018-01-31 20:36:08
I think the sudden boom in price was by people looking for a get rich quick idea ("21M club", "there arent enough bitcoin for every millionaire to own one", blah blah blah. few people were actually using it for stuff). Now that it very publicly lost a lot of people's money in a short amount of time, I don't the same mania will return to this drinking well soon.

People really interested will now about it anyways. It was already in that article, but now for those who didn't see it its getting blasted on reddit. The idea of most auctions is to find a better price than you can get in the normal market. But that's not going to happen now (not like I had $200k USD to deposit anyways lol)
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:36:08
Lots of people buy high and sell low when they first get in. It’s not smart but people do it. The price booms so people buy at 17k in fear that it’ll cost 18k+ soon. Then it drops by $900 and they have fears that it could be headed back to 14k  range so they sell to cut their losses go, and maybe attempt to buy cheaper. Then it goes back up and they lose patience and get back in when it’s high....so on and

Could be, but there are various facets of this space that have had room for improvement for a long time (why do Coinbase, Bitpay, etc have obvious shortcomings yet the nearest competition in their respective markets are nowhere near overthrowing their dominance?). So one can’t just assume that, if there’s a need, that a solution is coming.
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:45:27
Now that it’s been broadcast here to over half a million owners, the auction will just settle at the market price. Pointless.
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:55:59
By that logic it’s desirable for fees to keep increasing, and the efforts to lower costs are anti-Bitcoin. That’s simply not true, the prices aren’t this high because people are forced to hodl. What caused the skyrocketing price is the demand for bitcoin. Everyone who researched before they bought it surely read that it’s intent is to be a decentralized electronic cash system with limited supply. Nowhere in there are fees listed as an incentive for value. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:31:53
His reasons for giving it a C+ were pretty sound, "major network bottlenecks causing delays and high transaction costs." Not much different than what Steam said when they dropped support last month. If the author gave it an "A", despite the fact that just weeks ago Jameson admitted Bitcoin has significant issues right now, and is more of a store of value than a currency, readers would have a good reason to argue Jameson's own admission to the author, since he is a Bitcoin proponent.

Who knows what will happen, but I've always felt that Bitcoin can't die from the outside. People will still use it as a store of value, it just might not be mainstream anymore, and it might go back to being underground gold. But it will still be gold nonetheless. I'm sure they will just find a way to regulate/tax cryptos. You can't kill the technology or stop two internet geeks from sending crypto back and forth.

Well I meant since it’s it’s is getting our info from exchanges like Coinbase it’s bad. But if the technology upgrades to where we do trades off exchanges there is no trusted party they can force to produce people’s records.. Ultimately it may come down to what Charlie lee said that in the future it won’t matter which crypto you use because crosschain swaps will be status quo. Then it will take regulation more time to catch up with technology.

Nice! That is something that kept me out of bitcoin for a while, is not knowing you could buy fractions. It actually wasn't until i bought ether on coinbase that I realized bitcoin was fractional too. Most people assume a bitcoin works like a stock, and if you can't afford a whole stock, then you can't buy any of it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:43:49
There are plenty of stories. And Coinbase closed me and my wife’s account because since we have the same bank account they said it violated their TOS because it circumvented their controls on buy limits. Is their really something suspicious about a husband and wife using a bank account? Both of our IDs were verified. So I have first hand experience that they close accounts for irrational reasons.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:00:37
Its surreal for me to read a thread about people buying below $19,000. Bitcoin has come so far so fast.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:15:24
Pretty much anytime you send bitcoin there is a fee for conducting the transaction. Since bitcoin miners are the ones who provide the computing power for the network, they get to keep a piece of the bitcoin (as a fee) we send in our transactions. The problem is that Bitcoin only processes transactions once every 10 minutes, AND the amount of transactions for each 10 minutes is also limited. So what happens is that if there are a lot of people sending bitcoin to and fro, it creates a backlog where the transactions that didn't fit into the 10:00 block will have to wait until the 10:10 time, and the ones that miss 10:10, have to wait until 10:20, etc etc. And it creates a long line of transactions waiting to be processed. But in order to prioritize transactions should be processed first, the miners select transactions that offer them the highest fees. This means that if you want to send your $50 of bitcoin from one wallet to another, you can pay a $20 fee and it will happen quickly, or pay a $6 days and possible wait a day or more. People who mine bitcoin do it for the financial reward so they prioritize the transactions that pay them the highest fees. Therefore it can cost you $70 to send $50 worth of bitcoin, which is not practical at all. 
Also, as you know bitcoin is divided into decimals. The OP points out that there is a minimum decimal limit required for fees, and as the value of bitcoin goes up,  people who buy small amounts of bitcoin now cannot even afford the minimum fee limit.
The Lightning Network is a project that is supposed to alleviate some of the congestion on the Bitcoin chain, but it still hasn't been released. The other thing the OP mentions is increasing the blocksize. This will increase the number of transactions miners can process every 10 minutes, thus relieving some of the congestion and hopefully reducing fees.
Hope that helps you understand the concept of things.

Well there is cash, and there is stocks. You may feel okay asking someone how much stock they have in something, but you don't ask them how much cash they have in the bank. Bitcoin is a cash system. People can try to find out how/when/where/what accounts my access your bitcoin. you keep your bitcoin. Plus I don't mean may not necessarily be the person asking you, but it could be someone else they tell in casual conversation. Since its cash, and not a regulated stock, you should never ask someone how much their bitcoin balance is.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:59:55
Naw, segwit took the opposite route. Instead of increasing blocksize, segwit significantly reduces the amount of a transaction's data put into the block.. This results in more transaction being able to fit in each block. And yes, companies must specifically integrate segwit into their software. Otherwise users are left paying the old, high fees. But these same companies wouldn't actually make money off of the high fees unless they are also in the business of mining too.
Segwit transactions are WAY faster and cheaper than regular ones, I think these companies are lagging out of laziness, and because it doesn't actually save THEM money (it saves the customer money).

As soon as I got into bitcoin I noticed the irony at how many people entrusted their trustless currency to exchanges like Coinbase. But then I got it, it’s very unforgiving if you lose your bitcoin and people would rather let a company hold their money who is 1) thoroughly competent in tech threats 2) accountable if their money gets taken. And I was also surprised at how expensive it was to move bitcoin around. I think with improvements in these areas (ease of use/security, and fees) it will grow in *use*. And the growing value will be a byproduct of usefulness.

And I'm glad I got in when I did, because it blew up this year. With that being said, if for any reason the long term outlook changes, I'm happy to move my money into another investment.

If this is like the Trezor, you can use a passphrase to recover your funds. Meaning, if you lose your wallet, the person who finds it must know your device specific PIN in order to log in. And you can simply download another Bitcoin wallet that's compatible with Ledger and enter the passphrase, and you will gain access to your funds through the compatible wallet.
That's how it works with Trezor anyway. I believe ledger is the same.

I think this is moreso the ripple effect of Coinbase's awful Bcash surprise. The insider trading made the whole crypto industry look vulnerable to manipulation, plus the fact adding introducing something called "bitcoin cash" to a brand new customerbase is confusing, and when people see the value of Bitcoin plummet they are naturally gonna wanna run away to save their money. It was a really stupid move by Coinbase, and they are the one's I blame. I know nothing about Jihan, but I've seen him post publicly several times that " Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin.

Day trading any asset is extremely risky. Even the Nasdaq has a page on their website explicitly warning that daytrading is dangerous. IMO it doesn't matter if you're a professional or not, nobody knows that future, nor can predict the next peak or valley of a price chart. Day trading will cost you money, and it is addictive.
I lost a bit of money this summer by trying to trade too, and I was doing it on GDAX where there are no fees. I came up decently on a couple trades, but it didn't outweight they bad trades. When it was all said and done I had lost 1/3 of my original bitcoin investment. Since then I have only held, and I hodling is SO much better

Nothing, and JIhan Wu seems okay with the two co-existing (He has tweeted before that Bitcoin is Bitcoin, and Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash. Asserting that he wants BCash to have its own identity). But Roger Ver is a retard. Actually he's pretty smart, because he recognizes that any version of "Bitcoin [insert surname here]" will be low value just like Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Gold, etc. So Roger refuses to leave the main chain alone because he knows Bitcoin Cash will end up like all the other forks if he can't steal the name of simply "Bitcoin"

Because the other hand, the people buying in to ponzi schemes are told that the share/contract/item of the business they buy into will be worth more in the future and are discouraged to sell by the people running the scheme. So outsiders parallel it to bitcoin because people who are long in bitcoin tell everyone HODL because it will be worth more later. HODL isnt sound investment advice because it can come time to cut losses and rebuy at a lower price. Ive always thought HODL sounded ponzi-ish. If someone really believes in bitcoin as a currency they would buy and spend it. Because its a currency. Another property of ponzi schemes is that the business dont actually function as they are advertised. In bitcojn’s case HODL defies the nature of “use”, and “use” is the logical thing that should take place to encourage adoption.

For "security". You can read various threads here on people who have been locked out. Coinbase uses an algorithm to help with security, and if you do something that traggers the algorithm, it automatically restricts certain actions from your account. Only a customer service staff can review and remove the restrictions, but Coinbase is backlogged for weeks. I've been waiting over 3 weeks for a human response.

I would love to know why the price would go up again? Bitcoin publicly lost a lot of people a lot of money. What you’re saying is like saying adjustable rate mortgage loans (the once-popular loans that caused the 2007 crash in the US) will be in high demand one day soon. People won’t often touch a hot stove twice. Who knows what the future holds but what makes you think all the dumb money that made the price skyrocket in get-rich-quick dreams is going to return? Those people got burned, and they were a large crowd

It is safe against someone trying to remove it from your account in a hurry, but not safe from Coinbase locking you out of your account or disabling withdrawals. So safe from hackers, yes.

I’m not a tech head but here’s what Ive read as I followed the situation:
Bitcoin is scheduled to undergo a split in November. The two resulting chains will not interact with each other at all. The entire idea to split bitcoin was agreed on by some companies, but not others. Coinbase agreed to it, meaning after November they are committed to only support the new chain, and not the current/original chain. The original chain has way more nodes running it (the last I read there are about 7000+ as compared to about 190 supporting the new chain).Nodes are just normal people who volunteer to run the Bitcoin client on their computer, and their computers help create the ledger of the constant transactions. The less nodes supporting the network, the less secure Bitcoin is. So you can see why people are concerned that a major company like Coinbase is going with the new chain which barely has any node support (among other technical concerns that I didn’t mention).

Well he made billions in other industries so he thinks understands those industries, the consumer-base, and their business=structures better (I read he looks seriously at a business' corporate structure assessing whether an investment is worth his time). So he really hasn't had a need to get into tech, when he's a billionaire from non-tech. Although now he just finally bought a large portion of Apple. The article I read said it was only after a lot of analysis by his team though. So even trying the largest tech stock on earth wasn't something he took lightly.

@_date: 2017-09-25 22:56:56
because Bitpay recently committed to Bitmain, who is going with Segwit2x. When Bitpay's customers find out they're on the wrong side of the bitcoin split they may lose faith in bitcoin as a whole and that is a major step back for mass adoption and can cripple the value.

Roger has been doing that for months. Interestingly enough Jihan Wu, a BCash proponent does not seem to agree with hijacking the Bitcoin name and openly tweeted his stance saying "No. Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash."

I agree. In May the turnaround time for customer service was like 2-3 days. But this month weeks ago my Buys and deposits were disabled and I've been emailling them for over two weeks and they still have given no response.

they are known to close customer accounts without giving reason. You can also check their sub reddit and theres no shortage of customers whose accounts are frozen and who cant access their own money for peroods of time, with no response from coinbase.

As a noobie the first thing to look at historically is that bitcoin is very volatile. Price changes of 10% in a day are not abnormal. If you can't handle big price swings you're going to end up getting weak and selling low, then buying high. Just hang on and understand that this is the nature of the game. It's been happening for years and its not about to stop now.
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:07:46
It sounds immature. But consider:
1) This decision can affect people's real money. It's no different than if a bank made a contentious decision. Customers would downvote the bank.
2) There are strong hints of collusion. Coinbase was pro-stability and status-quo monday, but after another big US exchange made a blog post supporting 2x Coinbase did a 180
3) They are trying to be deceptive by using euphemisms. Everyone knows Coinbase's market is their 10M customers. And coinbase says the market will decide Bitcoin, but then they clearly say whicheve chain has greatest hashpower wins. Hashpower and market are two different things. But they try to pass off the groups of miners as representative of the market.
4) Again, people stand to lose REAL MONEY if this thing fails, and right now Coinbase is collaborating with other businesses who want to force an issue, while pretending to make its totally up to their customers.
So yes, community needs to hit Coinbase where it hurts, no different than any other bank. Brian Armstrong, on twitter, did say that community support would be taken into account.

I don't know what country you're in, but at the very least, in the US not all banks are automatically backed by the all the citizens. US Banks can be insured, in case they go under, but even that only covers a certain limit account. Therefore if that banks screws up and over-lends, then the people who have accounts there can only expect to be insured for a limited amount of their cash. Bitcoin (assuming you keep your keys) eliminates the problem of having your bank ruin your finances when it loans itself into oblivion. the US Federal Reserve only requires banks to have a small fraction of their cash on-hand (I read that its around 15%). The rest can be loaned out. Therefore banks HEAVILY loan out their customers' money, but as long as the debtors pay them back, the system works fine. But the recession (and the depression of the 1930's) showed how dangerous heavy lending is, and so Bitcoin was borne out of that era. So bitcoin gives people a way to not be damaged by bailouts, by not giving a bank their money which the bank would loan away 85% of anyway.

Yes it's because 2x wanted to be referred to simply as BTC. That's because being known to the world as Bitcoin is a valuable thing (that's why the owner of Bitcoin.com refers to his preferred altcoin as "Bitcoin" although it's not the real Bitcoin). If there's anything else in a coin's name beyond "Bitcoin" or "BTC" it means it's not going to hold the value of original Bitcoin. BCH, and BitcoinXT for example....

No, because the man was charged with money transmitting, to which it specifically says there is no threshhold for money transmitter. A lot of FinCEN's laws are loose catch-all's, so that if it seems like you're compliant with one, there's another vague one they can accuse you of. They define money transmitter here: 
"Any person...who...transmits the currency or funds, or the value of currency or funds, by any means..." That is so retardedly vague a lawyer can make that apply to pretty much anything. And notice part B of the definition is even more vague just in case a defendant somehow falls outside of part A.

How do you suggest customers show they don’t appreciate a company risking their investment? If this was Wells Fargo would it bother you to read that they did risky things with their customers money? Why do you feel with Coinbase must the customers must stay quiet? Everyone with bitcoin has an interest in this move, and should let others know. Non-USBitcoin exchanges the like Bitfinex will continue at status quo after the fork. But Coinbase is going to cause confusion naming a different chain bitcoin all because the mining pools want to. So Coinbase is hurting Bitcoins cause by giving into the confusion that will result, not the unhappy customers. Also, nothing stops those who support 2x from voting in favor of Coinbase, so there’s nothing unfair about it.

I learned the same lesson this summer with Ether. The Aug 1 fork was impending, so I switched out to Ether because I was new to crypto and saw it jump from 80 to 300+ in my short time here. So I bought, and the flash crash happened, and afterward it continutally dropped in price compared to bitcoin. Then I tried buying litecoin to insulate myself from the upcoming Aug 1 fork, but litecoin kept dropping too. 
It was at that point I learned a valuable lesson: Bitcoin is the backbone of the crypto world. On days when Bitcoin trends poorly, alts trend poorly too, 99% of the time. So I got back in, after losing 1/3 of the bitcoin I originally had, and since then I've only bought and held bitcoin (although I'll gladly spend &amp; repurchase to help encourage merchant adoption). But never again will I trade bitcoin in the short term. I later bought a little bit at 4800 and watched the value plummet to 3200, and held strong, so I'm proud of myself for learning my lesson. Just hold. By trading it away you are betting against it. And it will cost you in the long run. You may come up once or twice, but the majority of the time you will be wrong and lose.

It's not that, it's that this can cost people a lot of money if the split causes a loss in value. Right now Bitfinex is calling legacy bitcoin BTC, and coinbase will call 2x BTC. Bitcoin is supposed to be global, but its not even the same thing in the US anymore. That can shake mass adoption, and thus the value, big time, and lose a lot of money.
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:49:48
You can't predict what a market full of people are going to do. I will say, that before the Aug 1 bitcoin split there was a bear marketand Bitcoin just couldn't get past 3000, and often stayed around 2600 because nobody would buy, because of the uncertainty of the impending split. In the weeks before the split, it quickly dipped to the $1900s (33% below the $3000 All Time High)before rebounding as people gained confidence that any split would be non-consequential. Well there is another (very serious) split coming in November, and at some point the bull market might end as people wonder what will happen to bitcoins integrity after the November split.

Too true. In Coinbase’s case their 10,000,000+customers are the market. IMO Coinbase is being deceptive with that phrase “letting the market decide” and/or is colluding with Gemini to ensure the definition of “bitcoin” is consistent with the US to minimize lawsuits by customers who traverse the two (it’s also no secret that people who get booted from Coinbase often head to Gemini). My basis for the suspicion is the fact that Coinbase completely flipped from their 10/23 blogpost, just 24 hours later. The flip totally contradicted their previous position and matched Gemini’s post which was made just hours earlier.

agree. its been a bear market for the last month, and this week the price really started to drop with gdax announcing they may pause all bitcoin trading until it gets sorted out. Who knows what other exchanges may announce, but the increasing isn't over. I wouldn't buy right now, you'll be able to get more for your money in two weeks.

no i was referring to the current dip. i sold everything earlier this week, and because the price is still sliding I saved myself $300 per bitcoin (and the savings still r adding up as the price slides). And ill use the same fiat to buy back even more bitcoin if/when the split issue gets resolved after August 1. Im confident price will go back to new ATH's (thats why i bought bitcoinin the first place).

No its not a sale, its a withdrawal.

I don't know what concerns me more: the fact you had an EZ bake oven, the fact you had multiple EZ bake ovens, or that fact you couldn't bake good cupcakes.

the point of money is gain if you see a have blatant oppourtunity for this why *shouldnt* someone make the most of it?

Yes you would be safe because this announcement only applies to bitcoin. eth and ltc are different blockchains altogether.

It’s because sec’s van eck etf decision is due soon. Same thing happened last year in the weeks leading up to the winklevoss etf decision. Everyone buys, anticipating that if it’s approved the price will go even higher. If it’s not approved it drops in the next weeks.

exactly. or why have one bitcoin, when you could have sold during an obvoous dip and bought back 1.5 or more at a cheaper price tag? OP sounds more scared of the tax man than anything else. what he said totally defies common sense.
