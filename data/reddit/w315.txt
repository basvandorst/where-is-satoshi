Actually, I remember a case where it has been used: (link in German)
Summary: Arsonist got caught because he left newspaper articles at the crime scene(s), and at least one of those was copied at the newspaper itself. Police tracked it back to the newspaper, where someone remembered the guy asking for a copy - and they still had his address...

By American standards you would call large parts of the EU "left wing communist". So that's not really a benchmark...

Printing paper wallets with ink jet printers is a bad idea, because ink is usually NOT waterproof. So this waterproof paper is kinda useless...

You probably meant "Neinsager" :)

This wouldn't work, as man in the middle attacks actually don't need to change the public color, they change the mixed one instead.
Let's say the public color is yellow, and the private and mixed colours are:
Name | Private color | Mixed color
Alice | blue | green
Bob | red | orange
Eve | green | yellow-green
Now, the key(color)-exchange would happen, but instead of Alice and Bob receiving orange and green from each other, they receive the yellow-green of Eve, who has intercepted the green and orange and generates those keys for herself.
Alice and Bob have, without knowing, exchanged keys with Eve instead of each other.
Eve can now intercept each message from Alice, decrypt it with Alice's key, read (and possibly manipulate) it, encrypt it with Bob's key and send the result to Bob (and vice versa).
(*Alice's/Bob's Key* is technically the key negotiated by Eve with Alice/Bob, but that would have completely destroyed that sentence... ;) 
Also, I ignored the fact that mixing colours is not really a one-way-function, because spectrometers exist.)

I disagree. There were at least two of them.
The first one was accidentally introduced in 0.8, then reverted by a soft fork in 0.8.1 that later "legalized" the new 0.8 behaviour in another hardfork.
Just because the chain created by the accidental 0.8 hardfork was later abandoned, doesn't mean it never happened.

Not quite ELI1, but:
The author of the HN post argues that there is a difference between a (not existing) "real Bitcoin protocol" and the "Bitcoin core protocol".
The shortcoming of the (currently used) "Bitcoin core protocol" is that it isn't implementation agnostic - because a supermajority of Bitcoin nodes are running the Bitcoin core software (and not an other implementation), the Bitcoin core developers can dictate Bitcoin protocol features.
(Just like in a hypothetical world where a supermajority of all HTTP traffic would be sent by Microsoft IIS and received by Microsoft IE, there would be no "HTTP protocol", only a "MicrosoftTM HTTP protocol", and Microsoft could dictate its behavior).
He proves this by giving an example where implementation details of a previous Bitcoin core version dictated how the "Bitcoin core protocol" works.
Or, in other words:
As long as there is no Bitcoin core competitior with over 33% market share, the Bitcoin network is running the "Bitcoin core protocol" and therefore not fully decentralized.

Are you really arguing that adding features to a piece of software doesn't increase the complexity of that software? Think again.
Watch nerds who happen to be software developers have been calling features "complications" long before Apple started doing that, a famous example are the developers of the app "Vesper" for iOS.
