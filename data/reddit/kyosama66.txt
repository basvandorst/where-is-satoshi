Thank you for posting that second half. Saves anyone else from having to look to hard to find it!

It's a douche move to just kill off an entire currency, but does anyone else feel like this is kinda cool? It emphasises one of the reasons I support cryptocurrency; you CAN do this.
Things like this are a reflection of the freedoms Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies give us, total control of our own money.

I may have one. The sticker will have been peeled and redeemed, however. If that's cool, I'd probably get it off to you on the cheap. 
@_date: 2011-12-22 16:36:06
They already exist. I've seen at least 3 of them to date, granted they are on the UnderNet with Silk Road and whatnot, but they are there. I'll try to get some sort of link for you.

I never win stuff, but hey. Maybe this time.
@_date: 2011-12-01 09:24:58
HA. No, if I had been like, "lol, yeah; I'll buy you some pizza for 10k BTC".

I agree that the endgame has to be to get the coins out into circulation. People buying hundreds of dollars in these things to hold on to aren't really doing much good, since at some point; they'll have to enter all those private keys, or hold those coins locked up forever.
As far as indivisibility goes; that's, in my opinion, the biggest problem. Say we get another inflation swing. Or even if it stays at ~$3/BTC. How do I pay for my 99 cent bottle of coke at the gas station? Do I get change in USD? Do they send it to my wallet address?
Physical coins are a double-edged sword with notable positives and negatives everywhere. BUT: I feel this is a bit out of hand, since I was really just suggesting the idea of a secure, offline wallet to store BTC in that wasn't a list of keys on a page. :D
@_date: 2011-10-24 17:18:16
That's why I'm just getting a few singles to have around for the design. I'm also known to lose my shit for holograms (Just look at pokemon cards).
@_date: 2011-11-05 01:04:59
I'm NOT saying you should all use Casascius coins, I'm using it as an example of a one-way offline storage solution. Generate your own keys, then stick them wherever. I just like the hologram disintegrating to show it's been opened, and that's where I got the whole "piggy bank" thing.
@_date: 2011-11-05 19:46:58
I had a pretty sweet reply all typed out, then left the page &amp;
The private key remains valid, it just becomes obvious that it was viewd, and possibly copied/spent. [Like this]( You can/could "refill" the key by sending more coins (or the "change") to the address, but someone else out there already has your key, and could spend it again.
A better method would be plastic cards with magstrips containing a special wallet that would be read by the POS terminal, then debited, then cleared from memory. The card could be reloaded by sending it coins later. Like a debit card for Bitcoins. That system would have to be more widely designed and constructed than the Casascius coins, however. But that's just my two (bit)cents on the idea.
And in case you're wondering; here's 2 more shots of the broken holograms: [ [ The second one has the private key, but the reflection from the hologram was messing with my camera. It's printed on there in some damn small font.
@_date: 2011-12-02 10:41:49
It is for me. Searched "mt gox", second result.
@_date: 2011-10-29 18:00:14
That's a pretty spiffy idea. It should help reduce the odds of someone spamming the Shit out of you, at least they'll have to add a new/different address every time.
@_date: 2011-12-17 08:10:21
In this situation, I would say that your anonymity depends on the person tracking you not having access to MT. Gox records. 
Ideally, you'd buy your coins in cash from a miner, or trade them using a pre-paid card bought with cash. That way, the person selling can't identify you by your real details, unless you gave them. 
This is just my understanding, though. 
@_date: 2011-11-05 01:07:38
I understand that, and I would certainly use a key I generated myself for any large stashes, but you can't argue that the coins are spiffy-looking. As far as someone cashing it by gaining physical access to it; well, it's the same as cash. Don't let those you don't trust have access to whatever it is you're using.
@_date: 2011-10-29 18:02:52
I'd be happy to volunteer some time as a mod if you need help. Cool idea and all, I'd love to see it take off. I know I'm just a stranger, but let me know if I can help.

Use the  room on Freenode. It's the IRC room with people willing to trade.
@_date: 2011-11-05 01:10:17
That sounds like you just want to torture yourself. You could also store whatever you used to generate the keys as printed QR codes, then scan them in sequentially when you want access. As long as you generate the QRs offline, and keep them in a safe place, you could save yourself a lot of work without sacrificing security.
@_date: 2011-12-01 17:31:43
Oh damnit. I really need to be more careful when posting from my phone.
@_date: 2011-12-01 22:06:21
That's a good point. Imagine a modern mining rig in the beginning. You'd probably get 90% of all the blocks.
@_date: 2011-10-29 05:41:43
I made some submission. Are you limiting it to one submission per wallet address?
@_date: 2011-12-02 05:46:09
Oh man. Best of luck on that; I'd love to see you get that.
@_date: 2011-11-17 06:27:52
That may be so, but that transaction was over a million dollars. I just don't get used to that,
@_date: 2011-12-01 08:10:20
I think the answer is pretty obvious. I would make money. Or, at least, I would try.
@_date: 2011-12-01 20:11:36
I agree that we should look to do more than trade BTC in and out of USD, but some of us just don't have the skills or items people are willing to shell out their Bitcoin for. Sure wish I did, though.
@_date: 2011-12-02 09:56:09
I haven't used it extensively, but I can tell you that it allows you to issue buy/sell orders, and apparently now has paper key importing. As far as security; it's probably just like accessing the site anyways: It's only as secure as the network you're using. The app claims "All communications with Mt. Gox servers are encrypted with SSL technology. Additionally, signatures and keys are secured with SHA-512 and AES" but I have no way of verifying this, since I'm not about to fire up a packet sniffer and try to catch the data at 3AM when I should be getting to bed. I'd bet it's probably pretty secure, though.
@_date: 2011-11-05 05:58:09
PRESERVE THE SHINIES! And really; having the hologram in your hand makes it that much more mesmerizing.
@_date: 2011-11-05 18:06:33
I really like what you're saying here, but I'd like to point out that if we could get just a small fraction of the current production into physical coins (Casascius coins only make up less than 4% of BTC in circulation, but he only made the 1 BTC coin production numbers public, so who really knows?) It could become immensely easier for merchants to become accustomed to accepting them; just like any other physical currency. Our world of commerce and business isn't quite ready for someone to get to a cash register, scan a QR code and say "Ok, paid for!". I know it's a small one-off, but until more people accept BTC for what it is as a digital currency, a physical aspect is a great idea to help people understand it.
It also helps to be able to hold one while demonstrating and explaining the system to friends or whoever happens to ask.

Actually; I've successfully used Paypal to purchase Kiwis. [Like so.](

This is one of those "I'm so mad I didn't think of this first" moments. I mean, the guy never even had to do anything. I mean, he might have needed to buy it himself a time or two, but aside from that; it's a beautiful example of the free market working in the BTC setting. Hope he sells it.
@_date: 2013-01-28 19:40:57
I'm kinda in love with this idea. Seems like it'd be a good way to start 1 on 1 discussions and lessons both in an online and offline sense. Next up: Being "The Bitcoin Guy" at your local hackerspace.
