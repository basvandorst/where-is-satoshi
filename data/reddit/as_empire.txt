Coinbase implements segwit 
Bitcoin etf 
Lightning Network

 Not true, and cryptokitties was a perfect example of how fragile Ether can be as well. Blockchain is not made to scale.

Yes to diversify 
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:38:23
They said 2018, looks like it’s going to happen very soon considering the founder of coinbase is tweeting about it now. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:53:41
This. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:33:51

housing market crashed because people defaulted on their mortgages, and the stock market made their financial instruments for profiting on mortgages. 
you are basically comparing two different things that aren't close to being related to each other. 
The market is quite simple, there are 16 million bitcoins out there, and millions of people want to own one. It's a high-end collectible. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:07:33
LN plus Segwit will resolve bitcoin not being cheap or fast. 
These two are critical to long term success. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:59:39
man I wish. Cost of entry is too high now, I think a year from now it will be a rarity to see someone own 1 full bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:36:11

don't worry, Coinbase insures all digital currency stored if someone breached their system. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:53:03
it is very certain that BTC will hit 40K at some point. I'm guessing Summer
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:41:52
30K - Coinbase will launch Segwit and Lightning Network will announce launch date of Summer. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:01:16

Hey monkey, 
Did you see the latest statement from Nicehash. It’s a planned maintenxe update and he Bitcoin is safe and sound. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:57:15
Satoshi? Ya baby
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:01:12

@_date: 2017-12-06 06:00:27
Hold on to your butts.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:05:26
Damn homie, you lost your only chance in life to be a millionaire 
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:59:47
It’s in the best interest of businesses, wallets, and exchanges to activate the payment channel. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:21:13
exactly, none of this makes sense. He just conveniently he forgot where he bought it? Sorry kid, but your dad/mom are taking you for a ride. 
If he knew he has 450 bitcoins worth millions now and "forgot" where bought them, he would be severely depressed. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:21:53
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:43:54
not even close to the same scale. There isn't enough people that took out mortgages and loans that influence the price at this moment, perhaps in the future but majority owners of bitcoin is miners, and we haven't even seen real institutional funding coming into place. Once coinbase launches their custodian service, the landscape will change again. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:57:42
Lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:41:53
will never happen, even miners spend thousands of dollars on costs and electricity to get one bitcoin, they will never sell less than that. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:21:24
Wait till it hits 10K tomm, you will be crying. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:30:32
Just sent you 2 BTC
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:57:33
Do it before Lightning Network is announced. 
Also before Coinbase implements segwit. When that happens, look for a rapid growth in price for btc.
The only thing Bcash sells is cheaper and faster. Once Bitcoin resolves those problems, knockoff bitcoin is worthless.
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:23:18
Maybe as an 18 year old you should focus on building up fiat. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:39:56
Lol yep, it’s a lazy solution. Cryptokitties proved what’s going to happen in the future. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:23:31

@_date: 2017-12-28 21:06:25

@_date: 2017-12-13 01:46:19
You're essentially throwing money down a toilet. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:05:47
Don't think so since there plenty of people who will buy at the dip, and institutional investors are pouring money into it. 
Bitcoin isn't a traditional financial investment, it's a very unique concept that features a very finite amount of supply. It's essentially a commodity that is agile enough to be a currency. Think of it this away, if the 15 million millionaires all hold one bitcoin, then masses would be fighting over fractions of bitcoins which will drive the value up.
The demand at this point is extremely high. Also don't think the media attention has been positive, CNBC and Bloomberg have been talking about it how it's "fraud", "bubble", and will be the biggest crash in history yet Bitcoin continues to hit all time highs. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:02:30
Lol then go ahead believe a 3 week old site that is trying to get clicks, that statement may not even be real. 
Are people this gullible on the internet 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:07:23
"Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up" - Satoshi Nakamoto, 2009
the more wallets that are opening up, the more value is being created. As soon as Lightning Network is implemented, that solves high transaction fees and the entire media is going to create a storm again. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:05:03
So we discover time travel in 7 years?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:24:12
weak hands. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:15:34
I think it will hit 1 million much faster
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:44:42
lol it's probably another 18 year old thats broke as AF. Exactly, not only is he minus 726 dollars in his bank account, he's also losing money on bitcoin at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:34:59
This my friends is an idiot. Good luck maintains those machines and make 100k back in one year when he could have just invested directly and made greater returns. 
Oh yeah and electricity costs lol 
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:07:22
It’s actually a nice design. Good work.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:38:22
doubt it, as soon as there was an official date of futures, the week leading to the opening of futures was a major bull run. Beyond that, ETFs mean that hedge funds will be buying bitcoin directly. The more people own and hold bitcoin, the more value is created. 
hypothetically, think if the 15 million millionaires in the world all owned one bitcoin, the masses would be fighting over the fractions, driving the price up. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:13:33
I'm not sure of myself, I am looking at trends. One thing I have noticed, is that dips recover much faster than I have ever seen. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:38:24
this is the dip boys, buy in. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:30:21
I’m selfish and greedy :( crypto has made me self centered
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:35:57
nothing will, only a fool chooses to mine now. You would have made more in return if you just bought BTC directly and held it. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:25:37
Then don’t buy it. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:16:27
yep, it's definitely happening. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:58:57
Think of Bitcoin from a tech product perspective.
V1 - Store of value, massive adoption
V2 (Lightning Network) -  global currency 
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:46:00
Ledger is a game changer, your crypto is bullet proof. I just moved all my crypto off coinbase, it’s nerve wracking if it got hacked during the holidays. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:59:01
Do you even read? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:51:46
No, it will just make more people hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:20:41
Lol 700 is considered a dip? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:23:28
I guarantee you it’s not stolen
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:38:45
after you're done, go on a long trip or something will keep you occupied. 
The path you are on is not sustainable for your well-being and health. It's a good game but eventually you will burn out and you have to retire from it. Work until you hit 6-7 figures, then GTFO and live life. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:54:33

she can't buy a couple bitcoins on coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:11:46
Won’t happen for a while, too many new people trying to buy some of that 17 million supply and too many holders waiting for a dip to buy.
Every dip now only lasts minutes 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:12:07
it's a different landscape now, lots of people have confidence now after seeing it surpass 10K. I am just speaking from the trends that I have seen, if you think bitcoin volatility is the same as 2013, then you're looking at it wrong. The game has changed. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:21:10
Sent you 1 BTC
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:34:31
yes they do: 
All digital currency that Coinbase holds online is fully insured. This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result. Digital currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and digital currency accounts and value balances on Coinbase are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections. 
they only hold 2% online, the 98% is held offline and basically impossible to hack.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:02:23
if it's a bubble, it's a long way from bursting. There are 2 billion working people in the world and only 16 million available to purchase. 
There are 15 million millionaires in the world, if they all chose to buy 1 bitcoin, then the middle class would be fighting over fractions to own a bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:26:03
so you got him a 1 dollar bitcoin off eBay? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:20:40
the likelihood of people stop buying is very low considering hedge funds are starting to make ETFs for Bitcoin. Right now Bitcoin's main adoption driver is having a store of value. Transactions and currency can come later when the price stabilizes and it's more widely accepted. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:09:24
lol thanks for sharing, It's funny how it it actually on pace to be 1 million in 3 years. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:11:44
200 million users fighting over 17 million coins. That means bitcoin will be worth 100K+
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:10:42
It's because of Roger Ver, that greedy selfish asshole keeps on spreading fun on BTC
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:56:19
Lol of course you don’t, you want btc to dip or you’re bitter about missing out. 
This will not affect btc price in any significant manner. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:05:33
what the fuck are you talking about?
Last year in the same time frame it went from 922 to 864 which was a 8 percent decrease. 
Right now its its around 14% decrease which seem right to me consider how many more people have bitcoin as opposed to last year. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:16:56
good luck. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:32:27
I've made a pact when I cash out, I will never look at the crypto markets again. Go on a silent meditation retreat and disconnect for a month to reset. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:42:18
let's bitcoin to 1 million and be done with it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:03:30
Dump it all
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:29:21
It’s building adoption, when it’s ready it will become a global currency especially with so many people owning it 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:01:58
your dad is bullshitting you to look cool and relevant to his son. If someone bought something as obscure as bitcoin back in the day, they would have been competent enough to remember how they bought it, 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:56:29
like I've been saying, dips and downward trends will now last for hours. The game has changed
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:58:18
I think the only reason it won't crash as most people predict is because there is so much interest and such a finite amount of coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:58:35
go home, we don't want you. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:14:49
Volume = stability 
There has been more volume than ever in bitcoin which is why dips like the old days won’t happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:21:42
I’m pretty sure it be very rare to own one bitcoin by the end of 2018.
Congrats on getting one of the rarest commodities in the world. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:43:24
No one cares 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:42:07
if the 15 million millionaires all buy one bitcoin and hold, the rest of the world would be fighting for scraps. 16 million bitcoins to support a market that can be accessed by the world will make the price sky rocket. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:11:18
This is a direct cause of new people buying bitcoin and old buyers waiting for a dip to buy. 
This thing is going to skyrocket, John McAfee is going to be right. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:44:24
1 million 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:08:53
It will have very little impact except that it brings more brand awareness to institutional investors. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:08:05
1 million per coin
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:17:25
Lightning Network will be adopted by all exchanges and wallets very quickly 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:33:49
 
this site used to have a timer for hitting a million but it's stopped working now. Any other moon math websites?
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:33:09
lol. when did internet speed become any importance for mining? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:22:35
Cheap fees and instant transactions to go along with a monster user base? 
You can bet every altcoin that only uses faster, cheaper transactions as their strength will die. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:17:16
The funny thing is that it is hard to argue against his points, there is logic behind it.

who cares about bcash
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:10:04
when he said BTC will hit 5K, everyone thought he was foolish. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:55:24
sorry bro, you lost your money
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:02:30
It’s good, but it’s competing directly against monsters in this space. If bitcoin implements cheap fast transactions, raiblocks will take a major hit. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:51:01
This is the correct answer 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:27:02
Nope. 
Mining is no longer feasible, you better just buy the coins directly because pretty soon that boat is about leave as well with 500 billion market cap. 
it will take 7-10 months to break even if you're lucky and that will only be if bitcoin's price increases so you actually  end up with less BTC than if you bought today directly. Don't forget electricity costs and hours you have to put in to maintain. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:10:32
Cash out.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:51:37

@_date: 2017-08-02 21:13:13
If this was the first batch of antminer l3+, sure, but now there's multiple batches coming out that goes into November. The difficulty will make it harder to profit. I would have rather spent that money on alt coins. Use your researching time on coins rather than mining. 
My friend's experience: had a 100,000 mining setup, sold it, used the 100,000 to invest into ether before its big jump, now worth 3.5 million. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:39:09
mining is dead. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:42:51
The common person mines to gather the scraps of cryto currency in hopes the price will increase in the future. In the meantime, they're spending money on hardware and electricity which makes their ROI 8-12 months before breaking even. That's also best case scenario if the coin increases in value in the same time span. 
The real profiteers of mining are people with loads of capital that setup huge mining farms. You're too late, if it's 2012 you would have been part of the party. Now you're literally trying to scrape the bottom of the barrel. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:22:09
I prefer to be frozen for the next 10 years. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:19:33
although I know this is not true, this just shows how amateur crypto currency trading is compared to actual stock markets. the two biggest exchanges are shutdown to due to server load, are you kidding me? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:58:03
only because people can't access their GDAX or coinbase to sell. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:52:58
no one is, not at the current price. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:13:39
there is no bubble bursting for a long time, there is a mass amount of people waiting for it to drop so they can buy back in. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:44:45
I’ve given up on waiting, I’m buying it now. It’s just going to go up after the Big Bang theory episode

mom and pop miners aren't very profitable. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:59:17
don't get me wrong I'm ecstatic when I look at my blockfolio but I was literally going to press the trigger on a buy this weekend once the funds are cleared. 
oh well, what does a few hundred matter when BTC reaches a million. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:34:38
- machines are a headache to maintain. It's basically a lottery if you get good running machines or ones that causes you fits where you have to reboot every day. 
- the return are always diminishing and at a rapid pace, you won't break even for a few months in which you could have just bought the same amount in bitcoin at the present value and have it appreciate. 
I have a quite a few miners and I do it mostly as a hobby to be involved in all aspects of crypto, but if anyone is doing to make returns, I wouldn't recommend it.

the fact that you ask these questions, you have absolutely no idea what you are getting yourself into.

imagine the market cap of gold if it had the same utility and acquisition of bitcoin. I also think gold will likely be less relevant in the coming generations, the millenials have no desire to own gold anymore and are conditioned to value digital goods.

you're talking about a minority of people and not institutional investors.

mining is perhaps the worst way to approach crypto now. I regret purchasing ant miners considering I could have just invested directly into BTC and made much greater returns.

damn, just when I was planning to do a large order of BTC, this happens. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:11:49
I would wait for a dip, I think the price went up because some people still believe that the fork is going to happen. CoinBase just updated their iOS app and the description said this version will support "Segwit2X" even though the fork isn't happening anymore.

goodbye sweet prince.

1 million dollar bitcoin is looking likely. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:36:01
you can't. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:16:26
Thats probably the smartest thing you can do than keep in stored in a bank with minimal interest. Bitcoin is very liquid, if you need fiat back, you could do so quite quickly. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:38:27
Don't go into mining, you will have greater returns by buying directly now and letting the value appreciate. You will wait a year to break even with a bitcoin miner. wait for the dip, never buy when a 7 day trend is pointing up. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:26:43
how long did it take you unload all of them?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:48:11
below 10K, we're crashing hard
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:32:06
up to you, 
quadriga's office is linked to a residential house and when I asked for a wire request from coinsqure, they told me to wire it to a company called "Gonumerical" 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:14:53
yep, everyone fell for the pump. Bitcoin is falling to 8K and will stay there for a while. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:36:41
not really, it will hit 1 million in June 2020 according to the moon math. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:21:53
that will decrease by the time you have your machines arrive effectively increasing until you break even. 
It's also a headache, you will likely have to monitor and reboot machines every couple of days. You could have just bought Bitcoin at it's current price today and make a greater return in the long run. You're just delaying yourself 6 months to buy the same amount of bitcoin you could have bought today and at a likely cheaper price. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:32:16
I sold everything, will buy back in when this crashes to 6K
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:16:08
hell no.
I would spend it on bitcoin itself and let it appreciate. You're going to be greatly disappointed in the returns as time passes. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:45:49
I'm trying to sell but they won't let me either. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:45:03
1 million in 2020 isn't starting to look out of place 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:17:24
yep, you're too late
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:33:40
now traders will be able to short Bitcoin, so people can start profiting when Bitcoin's price goes down. It used to be just a one-way street where people will only profit when the price goes up.  Get ready for price manipulation when Hedge funds start playing with their war chest. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:15:41
I think there will be a dip
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:29:32
stay away from quadriga and coinsqaure. shady companies 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:42:00
1 million by 2020: 
Only 21 million tokens out there with interest increasing every day, at the very least, Bitcoin will be a high end collectible. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:06:37
Welcome to the millionaires club 
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:02:07
BCH doesn't even touch 1% of the awareness of Bitcoin globally. 
My grandfather knows what Bitcoin is, if I mention Bitcoin Cash, he would likely be turned off. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:01:31
lol any company that’s trying to compete with google search is vaporware. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:08:42
it means something when a guy who has been investing since the start of the internet says he has never been this excited. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:07:56
lol freemasons aren't what they used to be. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:44:18
This is what institutions and whales wanted, they wanted to starve the average investor to sell their bitcoin cheap before the next bull run
@_date: 2018-07-24 05:38:43
And immediately fell after
