Hi, If you have time, please advise me.
I have read everything in this thread so I have a good picture of all the issues people seen to have
Here is my problem.
1. I never filed for the old claim back in the days, however I followed the development during all those years and Im happy about this new chance to get some of the actual BTC back
2. Im 100% I have my old username, password and mail. But I cant login to check balance or do the new claim
3. The reset password function does not work, just gives same error like other guys get
4 i have tried to call the help number 50 times a day for a week during 1pm-10 pm. No one is picking up the phone.
5. If I do the offline claim, how big chance is there that they will get It and approve It? I mean, did anyone do the offline claim in the past and It worked? How dis you get a notification about It. I like to be sure It gets through. 
6. Im almost 100% certain I remember my BTC balance. But If It differ in any way, will try still approve my claim for the right amount of BTC? Whats your thoughts?
7. Regarding bitcoin cash, other forks and fiat from BTC sold, how will I claim for those? Or will that be auto corrected according to my BTC balance. Medling I dont need make a claim on those?
Would love some feedback so I can do this the most proper way.
