It depends who you ask? In the U.S and other developed countries? Probably not, the US dollar is strong and we have really accessible banking/credit cards. Under developed countries? Venezuela is a big example right now. They are using bitcoin to buy food because their government and currency went to shit.

If it anything it may serve as a stepping stone toward people accepting a new decentralized system vs jumping head first into bitcoin and the other alts.

What if the token is then used as a currency for the project? Is it still a security? Like it actually has a use, not just to raise initial funds.

unless it's legit at $0.00

How is this even more centralized? My current only option is Comcast. If this happens, I'll have two options. It can only be a good thing to have more options.

Nah they would just force them to block it for their country. Doubt they would start a war against basically the entire world just to get rid of internet access.

right even I have no clue what BTC is, if you show me it trading on coinbase or whatever for 8k, I'll probably take it and do my own research later on to make sure it's legit. Worst case scenario, I have this useless thing. Best case, I make 8k or hodl. Wtf would I want a random dollar for?

Not really, you can still keep your Comcast subscription.

What? Anyone who has every bought a piece of jewelry would know it has to worth something! At least more than chocolate.

I mean, it's 2019. All that can be Googled in five minutes.

It makes them stupid because they apparently don't have the mental capacity to ask what Bitcoin is or what the exchange rate for it is. Assuming it's worthless because they don't know about it and can't critically think for a moment makes them stupid. Also why not risk $1?

Not sure, I imagine some kind of receiver would be required. Location tied to it could do it.
