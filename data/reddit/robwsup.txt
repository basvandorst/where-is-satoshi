You trashed me twice on the same post? Not everyone is as L33T as you think you are. I didn't whine, I asked. Isn't seeking answers the key to educating one's self.

It is insider trading, it's just not illegal yet.

Bitpay wallet to Bitpay debit card. You nailed it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:23:28
Good luck. Seriously.

Look man, seriously you're right, I don't know everything about Crypto. I have been holding since 2013, and had a humble four rigs GPU-mining LTC for most of 2013-2014. For years before that they were doing SETI So I'm not an expert; I'm not a fly by night newbie. 
I was bewildered at the amount that it cost to transact BTC when it increased significantly in the past few weeks. I knew it would go up, it always does. We've (including you) never seen this volume ever. Shoot, GDAX traded 100k BTC in the last day. 
Be nicer. There are new people here, people's grandparents here, hell, my niece and nephew hold now. Part of the problem, part of the solution stuff. 
If you are an expert, people need and want your knowledge. If you start off with, "quit whining/crying", you're not helping anyone, including you. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:21:18
Thanks for your helpful reply. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:56:13
Nm, I've looked at your post history, you're just generally abrasive. 
December gets cold in your mom's basement, no problem man, I get it. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:33:21
Done. Glad this simmered down.....was stressing me. I'm in my 40's, with college-aged offspring. It's been awhile since someone acutely raised my temperature via the Arpanet. If you're even remotely in my age group, it further shores up my theory that, much younger than me you go toe-to-toe with your opponent, much older you send other people's kids to fight your conflicts, but around 35-45, you just want everyone to live and let live, even if they do it differently.
Figured out how to do a very low fee transaction to buy you Reddit Gold. Let's see if it eventually goes through, for science.

Bitcoin "slow transactions"....
My BCH transfer has taken 2+ hours now, without showing on Blockchain.
13fmfnWppMEMoocBq9fq8zAxUjnN5cpAd2 sent the BCH at 2243 EST.

I may have appeared a noob when I posted, but I doubt I was the only non-noob that was curious and/or concerned about regular textbook stuff seeming awry in the current market. 
I'm terrible at Forex trading, I've tried and failed. I've read and researched the candles/charts/tools and the psychology, learned the vocabulary, learned the software, but still come up short. I've got a BS in Nuclear Engineering so I'm fairly educated, but I am also practical enough that I can still build a house and rebuild a small block engine or automatic transmission. I've got the intelligence, but lack the knowledge or savvy to be even minimally successful at currency trading. I'd love to learn more. If you are even moderately successful at it, I'm impressed, would love advice and are happy for you. 
Re: your comment, You have to help people to help themselves. Maybe instead of telling them to educate themselves, maybe post a link that specifically addresses their issue. You certainly are fluent enough to know where to guide new people. You're right that people should read and research, but we don't live in Should-Land. 
It's a Catch-22 situation; the more people that get involved, the more our holdings accrue value, but with Joe-Public comes ignorance. This is not a bad word folks, it just means doesn't know yet, not can't know or can't understand. That being said, willfully ignorant is terrible. Joe-Public has a lot of money and influence though, and that can be a good thing. The stock market was rarely as profitable as it is today. Joe-Public caused that with the advent of 401k.
I think that we might be in the Bitcoin version of the "Eternal September". If you are not familiar with the term, Wikipedia it, it's a great read, and maybe relevant. 
Not that anyone has asked for it, but proof:
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:00:11
It wasn't great at 100k unconfirmed. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:25:51
It's to my Bitpay card. And yeah I'm not seeing an option to set it. That being said, wouldn't 6¢ take forever to confirm? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:27:46
And it's gone. $13.8k.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:18:24
So says the 11 day Redditor. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:36:59
Virginia (EST) still up.
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:04:02
Thanks man. Yeah, the money we all coulda/shoulda made on BTC would be really neat, but life is living, not spending. 
That being said, it'd be great to not have to worry about the mortgage every month. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:44:49
What part of the country? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:06:49
Yeah, I just got back at ~5k. First bought in at $250. Should have held (hodl?), but I didn't, but I'm back. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:34:36
That's cool. I do the digital wallet on their phone so it will be in their face all the time. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:42:56
Who doesn't? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:04:39
Why you talkin' about old shit? 
Oh yeah, that was two days ago... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:55:02
Just for the last almost decade. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:33:47
It's back up now, and cooking. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:52:34
Yeah, definitely be nice. We've got people's grandparents coming in these days. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:59:59
There were a few people telling you that you need to be more cautious, but some were straight up jerks. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:56:16
Almost back to $11k,
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:46:48
About $5k at current prices. Dodged the Mtgox fiasco. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:18:40
Everywhere. Get a Bitpay.com debit card. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:06:46
YouTube view counts are not immediately updated. Not sure how often a day they do it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:53:11
That's good news. Buy now! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:50:56
$800 is barely 7%. It's going to be okay. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:22:05
88yo, probably has never sent an email. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:00:09
Good job. That's 2.5x your original money. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:54:51
This is getting crazy. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:09:02
That's cool. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:39:36
"Sis, you just asked me how a watch works. Ima catch up with you later". 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:10:18
That chart puts it in perspective. People thought it was the end of the world. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:40:51
I can believe that. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:02:50
Yeah, GDAX bounced $9920-$9980 all day yesterday. When it finally punched through $10k, it went another 10% in 12 hours. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:49:08
This. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:08:36
Yeah, gdax.com has been buggy a few times this morning. They'll be upgrading I'm sure. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:03:12
I've had miners since 2013.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:49:47
Generally it's true. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:07:47
Lol, I gotta pull a Comcast/Verizon/DirecTV/etc on you...
"This offer is only available for new customers".
Man, I don't know how they do it. I felt like a jerk just typing that. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:13:08
The good thing is that you'll probably get it sorted out and you didn't withdraw at $5k/btc.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:49:16
Clickbait, Clickbait, Clickbait... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:48:19
Gotta look at it as ancient history. I made a good chunk mining/hustling DOGE through there. Sucks still, but came out ahead. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:04:01
You called the Segwit2x correctly too. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:44:06
Coinex is a bunch of fucksticks. they hold your coin, and ridicule you when you ask for your money.
