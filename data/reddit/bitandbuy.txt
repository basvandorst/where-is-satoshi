Hello everyone,
i am very excited to announce our first Bitcoin startup !
bitandbuy.com - Get your favourite apple products for BTC.
And it gets even better , we are able to offer a limited 10 % deflation discount for the first 100 orders.
From our FAQ :
We created Bit&amp;Buy, because we believe in Bitcoins and its future. We love to spend them and want everyone to love it too. Now you can spend your Bitcoins directly on Apple products. Fast, easy and secure!
Who are we?
We are 3 college students, highly infected with the Bitcoin Virus. Two of us living in the U.S. and one in France. We love the idea behind Bitcoins and wanted to create something to support the economy. That's why we have choosen to start a shop 100% dedicated to Apple products. It is always better to say, “Look I bought my iPad with this new thing named Bitcoins.” than anything else.
How fast do you ship?
We try to ship every order as soon as possible. Mostly within 36 hours!
Where do you deliver?
We try to deliver worldwide. Bitcoins knows no borders. If it's not possible to take care of your order, we will contact you.
How do you manage to give 10% deflation discount?
Bitcoin exchange rates are like roller coasters, but we believe in its future. So for us Bitcoins are always going up. Our funds are high enough to handle the fluctuations.
Are these original Apple products?
Yes, we work with different resellers in our countries. Every product is 100% new and sealed.
We hope to deliver your new apple product soon !
Jean, Miriam and Steven

Thank you for the helpful suggestions. We are currently working on a proper shop solution with more information and proper terms. It should be ready some time next week.

We are currently looking into this. For this type of transaction, we will probably have to find an insurance company to secure us, may take another week at least.

Well, thank you. Our products are all sealed. But if you don't have enough trust , it's fine. Some paranoia is allowed.
