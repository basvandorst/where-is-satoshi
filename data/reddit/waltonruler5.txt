Just dug up my wallet from 3 years ago because I had .25 BTC. My wallet client is Bitcoin qt, and it's 96 weeks behind. Do I need to wait for it to back up, or can I send them to my coinbase account now? Just trying to get everything in one place
Edit: Also it's telling my the alert key is compromised and an upgrade is required. Any wallet recommendations?

I think you're on the mark donating to basic resources like water in the third world. Mosquito nets are huge too. Givewell.org supports a lot of these.
I think anything that also supports entrepreneurial activity in the third world is also important. Growing economies lift everyone.
Lastly, in the first world, I think most of our issues relate to ageing. Anti-ageing may sound like sci-fi, but I think it's got the most potential for gains in the developed world.

I just checked five minutes ago. What the fuck is going on?

I couldn't even figure out what was up between the headlines.
Satoshi Nakamoto says he is not Dorian Nakamoto.
Dorian Nakamoto is not Satoshi Nakamoto, says AP.
NewsWeekly literally sucks dick.
Dorian Nakamoto gets free lunch, sneaky old man.

If you included the rationals, you'd still be countably infinite.
But I could see why you wouldn't want to deal with a dense set.

I completely agree with your point. But the kind of person that is okay with being extorted is likely okay with all of that as well. They still believe the police are their protectors despite evidence to the contrary.

And government has socialized the cost of that externality by (ideally) offering police protection to all citizens. In a society with private protection firms, a firm might conclude that a man that buys a nuke is more likely to come into conflict and more likely to incur them costs and would charge him a greater premium. I, of course, would not deny a man his right to own a nuke, but in any modern governmental system, he is likely only able to afford to do so by taking advantage of socialized protection services.

That's still a &gt;5% change
