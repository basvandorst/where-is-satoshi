Skepticism is **healthy and smart**, when properly applied.
I own thousands in crypto but am still skeptical, which is why I continue to research, read, and check my own assumptions.
There's a reason skepticism is so important in fields like science and law: The alternative is fanaticism, where people blindly push their beliefs at any costs.
Investing without skepticism is throwing your life savings and mortgaging the house to buy empty coins based on a feeling.
Investing without skepticism is *BitConnect.*
**Be skeptical.** Recognize that nobody knows anything, Bitcoin could be worth zero in a year, and nothing is guaranteed.
Then invest in the areas where your skepticism consistently leads to solid answers, but *always* be questioning and evaluating.

So, October. You've had Bitcoin for just over three months.

This reads like a 15 year old wrote it. If you really have a Bachelor's degree and are now in a top MBA program yet write like this, I weep for the country.
You're basically bragging about how smert you are, while admitting that you're flushing away money on a useless, outdated MBA.
That's the opposite of smart.
"The most important part of crypto is the blockchain .... They didn't even realize that's how you get BTC initially!"
What. 
"You get BTC initially from the blockchain?" Stop. Just stop.
Ten bucks says this story happened, but replace "MBA" with "high school" and "professor" with "freshman economics teacher."

It's so dense.

A Reddit account is not a crypto wallet.
Point is if you are all worked up over this "crash," get out because you over extended yourself.

BCH just dropped from 8,400 to 3,400 in literally a minute on Coinbase.
What the Sam Hell is going on?

Tldr; Guy who bought $100 of Bitcoin last month thinks he's now a crypto expert.
Nothing crashed. If you invested more than you can afford to completely lose, that's on you.

I have a friend and mentor who sold a TV station for about $10 million in the early 2000s, closer to 14,000,000 today's money.
Dude wears jeans, a baseball cap, and drives a beat-up Ford F-150.
He also travels the world and does whatever he wants, but the Lambo image isn't everything.

Credit card bills coming?
I don't actually think this is the reason for the dip, but it is true that 90% of westerners (not just Americans) load Christmas on the credit card.

All buying options are "grayed out" and say "UNAVAILABLE." This is after the "All maintenance completed" message:
For reference, I'm a U.S. customer, verified, with thousands of dollars of previous Coinbase purchases.

That doesn't mean that stock investments or real estate purchases were therefore wrong.
If you bought key stocks in the 90s you'd be doing very well right now. Mass ignorance =/= bad purchase.

This made me do a spit-take. Was not expecting that.
