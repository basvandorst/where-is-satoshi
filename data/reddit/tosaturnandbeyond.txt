Just wanna say that if half of America would do that Bitcoin would be $500K.

There aren't 32M wallets. First of all it's addresses, and second if there are 20M of addresses with $1 or more, the addresses with $100 or more are counted in the first category (&gt; $1). So the total number of addresses is 20 something million.

You'all missing the point. BTC at ATH was 4 days (I'm nice I'm picking from 16K to 19K and back to 16K). 4 days. BTC at $3700 (and below) was for 3 freaking months. Even if you were just here for the hype only a few bought at ATH, people didn't have the occasion. But buying at 3700? You had your chances.
@_date: 2019-07-26 14:39:57
Good on you
@_date: 2019-07-25 18:17:34
Some would say that the risk differs on how much you believe in it ;)
@_date: 2019-07-26 12:58:56
Bitcoin was at 19K for a few minutes, 3700 (and below) for a few months. You had way more opportunities to buy low than to buy extremely high.
@_date: 2019-07-25 21:45:44
If I made this thread, you can bet I bought Bitcoin at $3700. Hope you did too, great investor.
@_date: 2019-07-07 15:26:32
If you go down a bit it says the addresses richer than1/100/1,000/10,000 USD
But that doesn't mean much, because a lot of people have multiple addresses.

Amazon at 6 bucks was in 1998, Bitcoin at $3700 was Feb 2019.

1 million dollar Bitcoin is 18 Trillion Dollars (in reality it's more 15 considering all the lost coins). It's not even half of the off-shore banking market. Not even the double of Gold.
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:24:54
I see, but then everything you buy from an exchange is considered as non tainted (or maybe it was but through mixing and whatnot if exchanges accepted them then they're not considered as tainted?)
@_date: 2019-07-25 15:13:33
2042 for a million dollars Bitcoin? You guys are not very optimistic.
@_date: 2019-07-26 13:11:16
The point is to show how much it outperforms it. Of course it does, but by a 15 years long investment? I (personally) wouldn't think that much.
@_date: 2019-07-25 21:42:20
Never bet against Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-31 07:27:43
I did the maths too and I would have done the same as you. I’m 24 and 95% of all my saving is in BTC. And I’m not even scared. I believe in it *that* much.
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:20:48
Yeah it means that one coin is indistinguishable from another. Bitcoin is not fungible since you have tainted coins.

Especially from 16:00 to \~34:00 (but I highly recommend listening to everything). This is a remarkable demonstration of how Bitcoin is unique and going to be huge. If after listening to this he still doesn't want to put at least little money, then I am sorry.

Damn looks like you did everything good.
@_date: 2019-07-26 06:45:18
But guys, halving *can't* completely be priced in. Remember that the halving is not only "Bitcoin getting more scarce hurry up if you want your part of the pie", it's also way less selling pressure every 10 min from the miners. Everyday 1800 BTC or so are getting sold on exchanges by miners, that keeps the price down (or at least it stops it to go as high as it could be). When the halving will come, it'll be only 900 BTC from the miners sold, and that makes a substantial difference.
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:36:32
I see, thanks for your responses.
@_date: 2019-07-25 17:46:54
I said $3700 because that was the average price from December 2018 to March 2019.
@_date: 2019-07-07 15:08:10
I speaking about the coins that were used by criminals and that are know tainted. You know, Bitcoin is not fungible since everything is public. I've heard about tainted coins for years but I've never "seen" one, or seen an address with tainted coins.  
How does the protocol make the distinction between a tainted coin and a regular one?
@_date: 2019-07-25 21:21:16
Depends when you would have started. I choose $3700 because it was the average price for 3 months when we hit the bottom in late 2018/early 2019.

I've developed a passion for cryptocurrencies 2 years ago. Since then I spend hours every day reading about it, learning learning and learning. I'm a programmer so naturally I found it fascinating and wanted to learn HOW it works (and when I mean how I mean how every single piece of Bitcoin works, from proof-of-work to merkle trees to utxo and so on).
Read Mastering Bitcoin: [
Reading this I've build my own blockchain from scratch using Python and used it for a project I found interesting. Try to do the same.

If any of you have money that you won't need in the next 10 years, all of you should put all of it in Bitcoin.

A lot of people own more than 1 Bitcoin so less than 17M.

So it's like a Venmo/PayPal but with Bitcoin?

I see. Do you plan to support other cryptocurrencies? (Monero for privacy and Nano for speed would be great).

Must be such a horrible job to do, manipulating those millions of dollars every day while you know you'll only get $2K at the end of the month.

Excited to see their UI/UX.

Remember that most exchanges fake their volume so don't compare it to the $700M the exchange "coinsuper" did.
@_date: 2019-08-11 21:53:06
Unpopular opinion: I think Bitcoin will 100x in 6 years or less (just one year after the 2024 halving, as these effects tend to appear with a delay).

Question: what will happen when MtGox's BTC get released? Also, will those coins be tinted?
@_date: 2019-10-01 16:58:55
What worries me is that even the most bullish maximalists in the crypto space see $10M per BTC the endgame (something that they think will happen in several decades). This model predicts 50% higher than the endgame goal in less than 10 years.
@_date: 2019-10-01 17:59:58
It is $15M by 2028
Otherwise agree with what you said.
@_date: 2019-06-16 11:54:48
True. But in the same time, if Bitcoin becomes what we all want it to be, kids will get their pocket money in Bitcoin. I just don't know how many &lt; 7yo kids their are so it was easier this way.

If you can find any investment asset besides Bitcoin where you put $1 and get back $50 in 4 years call me.
@_date: 2019-12-24 15:10:42
Found it interesting that he doesn't think past market cycles will repeat this time and thinks $250K per Bitcoin is feasible only one year before another halving (a very important one since it will make Bitcoin the hardest asset on earth, with double the stock to flow of Gold).
@_date: 2019-12-24 15:15:10
Draper predicted $10K Bitcoin 2 years in advance at exactly Dec 2017 though. I don't care about fucking Tone Vays predictions that are wrong 90% of the time but Draper is a tad more legitimate.
@_date: 2019-10-01 15:03:45
I want to believe to this model, I really do, and so far there's no denying it's really accurate. But it predicts $1.3M by 2024 and $15M by 2028. I don't know man. I can only wish it was true but that seems... Insane? Also when is it gonna stop? Bitcoin can't go to a trillion, at some point the model has to stop working no?

Listen to me do not memorize your seed. You will forget it. It's not something you will use everyday, you might never have to use it for years, you will forget it. Encrypt your seed with a passphrase of 6 words and hide the seed somewhere safe and that's it.

The deposit gets lower if you deposit 10 BTC, they don't care about the USD value. It might change if Bitcoin reaches $1M though.
@_date: 2019-09-22 00:39:31
People who bought in 2011/2012 multiple thousands of BTC for a few grants would all have sold way before today, not a lot of people can resist a 1000x return on their investments (heck, some of those guys bought 30K worth of BTC and it's now worth multiple hundreds of millions).
Plus, you don't have to sold everything, just the fact that not a single Bitcoin moved out of tens of thousands makes it extremely likely that everything is lost.
@_date: 2019-09-02 21:10:43
Jeez guys I just realized that at the beginning of each month in the last 4 months BTC pumped. People are pouring their salaries as soon as it hits their Bank account.
@_date: 2019-09-21 22:55:44
[  
3.75M coins didn't move since July 2014. You can bet most if not all of these are lost.
@_date: 2019-09-18 21:57:57
Guys I just realized that if Bitcoin ever reach $1M and that you have one and put it in a interest account like BlockFi it'll bring you at least $62.000 of interest per year with compound interest if Bitcoin doesn't move and stays at $1M. So you can live of your single Bitcoin for the rest of your life.
@_date: 2019-09-22 07:47:36
Haha 99.9% of people would have sold way before today's price if they had bought at less than a dollar their BTC. If your $10K investment is now worth more than $100M you just sell, at least a massive portion of it.
@_date: 2019-09-19 00:00:48

@_date: 2019-09-09 19:49:08
Because if the project is worth $120B you know you are investing in something that has value and you're not the only one in the boat (also why the more Bitcoin is valuable the more it will attract people).
You need some serious balls to invest in something barely worth $10M with a thousand people on it.
@_date: 2019-09-22 07:51:57
@_date: 2019-09-22 07:32:07
Sure so you've been buying since 2010 (or should I say mine) when BTC was at a few cents and you didn't sell something that's worth hundreds of millions, sure buddy. 
And check those addresses with multiple thousands of bitcoins in them, not a single coin has moved since the first deposit 5 or more years ago. Not a single one. Those coins are lost.
