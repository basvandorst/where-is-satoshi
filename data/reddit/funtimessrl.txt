Hodl till you're broke, it's the bitcoin way!

It is also the most useless and inefficient blockchain in the history of mankind. It does absolutely nothing, except running a periodic virtual token lottery so that some Chinese miners can cash out on your money. It's super funny, but only for those who aren't part of the pyramid, and that can laugh at the huge losses you guys have :)

Are you implying they could have cashed out without completely destroying the price? The whole purpose of the ETF is to try to get enough liquidity to dump their buttcoins on greater fools.

I'm putting my speculative 1% in beanie babies. At least those aren't virtual, and have greater chances of success compared to bitcoin. I recommend you all do the same. If just in the USA, people invested 1% of their retirement savings into beanie babies, the price of beanie babies would be 50 times higher.

So, the crazy people are the ones NOT buying virtual tokens for $330 each? Tokens that many of you paid $1200 for? I'll enjoy my insanity while you dig an even bigger hole in your finances, thank you very much :D

Of course you are. Losing 70% in just a few months is how one gets rich quick. When it goes to zero you'll be even richer!

OP is dumb and so are you :D Enjoy the losses, it will only get worse!

Tell him Satoshi can't steal his coins. However, what he can do is dump his own stash in all the exchanges and crash the price to zero forever. Cause he's got a bunch of them. And he might be interested in your real money. Fingers crossed, right?

Price was also higher a year ago. REKT losers

No 3% fee, but expect to lose 100% on the price dropping. I'm sold!
