Once it’s stable like a currency it may be treated as a currency. When it goes from $3000 to $12000 in a period of months it looks like a stock asset on steroids and will be treated as such. There are no free lunches.

Easy to use, right?

Trezor has a “test my seed words” feature. Basically you enter them and it tells you if there were correct or not.

This actually worries me. Millionaires aren’t really a problem for the government. Billionaires are. If it becomes possible that overnight billionaires can happen due to crypto you should expect extreme governmental action.

That’s so cute

As a Bitcoin hodler, reading this post makes me really concerned about Bitcoin ever becoming simple enough for the masses to understand and adopt.

Retiring at 55 gives you roughly 33 years of working for someone who starts after a 4 year degree. I think that’s plenty. I say do it.

My deposit to Coinbase Pro took a week. Is there some other method to make it instant?

If you know it, it’s already priced in.

Only bought crypto with USD on Coinbase and then transferred to a hardware wallet. That’s the full extent of my crypto career. No plans to do anything else for years.

Thanks. I’m well informed on capital gains taxation. Just was curious how crypto purchases were treated.
@_date: 2019-11-09 23:08:02
Not until purchases cease to become a taxable event.

Those are the ones that sit in the BarcaLounger all day watching Maury and Judge Judy. My life is significantly different than that. My days would start with a long run or trip to the gym. Every. Day.

Wouldn’t buying that coffee be considered a taxable event and become a headache come tax time?

What happens when there are no more (or very few) coins left to mine?  Aren't the miners the computers storing and processing the ledger?  Who does that once there's no more coins to mine?

For those with a substantial traditional portfolio what would you say would be a good percentage to have in crypto?  1%?  5%?  More?

How do wallets (hardware in particular) know your balance?  I assume the wallet only has your private key stored locally. Does it connect to the blockchain and scan EVERYTHING for addresses that could have been generated by the local private key and then add the balances up on those transactions?

Newcomer investigating Bitcoin here. Is Bitcoin to the point that one could buy some, setup a Trezor with the keys, and throw it in a safe deposit box for five years and come back and still have that Bitcoin?  Would I have to worry about things like forks or protocol updates?  Can a hardware wallet truly remain “cold” for years at a time?

Sooo much easier than fiat!
