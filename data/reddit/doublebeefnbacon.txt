Currency is an extremely important aspect of our economy and growth. Bitcoin essentially is opposite of the current currency, in that it is scarce and increases in value. The economics of bitcoin is the most important thing to consider in thinking about its adoption and value growth into the future. It will never be used by businesses or economists - generally rational people - unless there is a serious case for an economy based on deflationary currency with empirical evidence. Deflation of currency is theoretically a very negative economic force and has proven to be so.

Bitcoin's limited supply would lead to a deflationary economy, whereby prices fall over time rather than increase. Having money that increase in value reduces the incentive to invest and spend, decreasing the rate of growth. Doesn't stop economic growth, just hinders it.

Interesting points, after months of posting about this stuff someone is finally making some sense. 
I would then question the stability of an economic with a static/close to static deflation. We use inflation to maintain a certain rate of growth to decrease the overall fluctuations in growth - essentially keeping the economy more stable.
In my thinkings about bitcoin and economics I had always assumed bitcoin as an all or nothing scenario but it would be interesting to model the value of certain numbers of users. Mathematically it will continue to be there for a long time, but only if it's used in reality will it continue to grow against fiat. I guess if there's always a market for trading bitcoin for fiat then there will always be value to bitcoin. 
Hmm, so living in the economy which we do, where the vast majority of money was in fiat it would be interesting to see the economic force of more people putting their fiat into bitcoin. I understand bitcoin would increase in value but that doesn't matter. I guess it would affect aggregate inflation, the fiat is still in circulation but it's value is pushed into bitcoin. I guess it would be a similar effect to people buying lots of gold, only difference being gold has a more long-term track record as a store of value. Maybe bitcoin will actually become as legitimised as a mineral we have used for thousands of years.
In any case, the way the bitcoin supply is almost entirely distributed by 2030 is also interesting. Meaning almost all the potential value in bitcoin will be owned by this time.

Could you please explain this statement?
@_date: 2015-05-20 11:27:50
Hmm, this positive news is about blockchain as a technology. I haven't seen too many articles claiming bitcoin will be a global currency, as it should if it were a more effective technology (currency). 
I think this is because many people forget that bitcoin is a currency. Currency in economics being in some ways a gear of the economy. If you make this gear bigger, smaller or spin it backwards it has different effects on economics growth and ultimately, the development of society. 
The trend of Bitcoin's value over the long-term poses threats to economic growth. A good economist should explain the ways bitcoin may operate in the economy. Particularly examining the effect of the supply of bitcoin. 
I've been on my soapbox lately trying to discuss the economics of bitcoin as currency but no-one that sees is interested. So if no one does a good paper on this I'll do it. Won't be for a few years until then though..

My biggest concern for bitcoin as 'the global currency of the future' is that the economic ideology of our governments oppose bitcoin and deflationary currencies.
During the transition to a deflationary currency the following would happen:
1. a substantial reduction in all investment products (companies, bonds, ect.).
1. central banks could no longer change base interest rates
These are both functions that governments use to create currency and debt. Both devaluing peoples fiat currency and adding to national debt. As well as giving governments the ability to influence peoples amount of consumption and investment. 
3 Questions:
1. Is government economic intervention a net positive or net negative for humanity?
1. Would we have the same potential economic evolution without government influence?
1. Does rapid economic growth matter most? OR Are we sacrificing the progression of morality and humanity for increased economic prosperity?


1. Bitcoin being decentralised, central banks and governments would lose the power to set interest rates. This has allowed them to control economic growth and influences personal consumption. Banks would become part of the free-market again.

Replacing the global currency supply with bitcoin
Value of 1 Bitcoin to replace World currency = World (M0) Cash and Coin amount / Current number of Bitcoin available (14/01/15)
= ~5,000,000,000,000 / 21,000,000
= $238,095

I've asked this question so many times in thanks for answering!
I have a few things which I'd like to add to the question if you wish to comment:
1. Could you comment on the supply curve of bitcoins? 
 
It would be useful to model demand in many scenarios. In any case, the drastic curve of supply is very concerning from an economic standpoint.
2. In Macroeconomics we are taught that a key factor in the economic recoveries since the great depression has been the use of Keynesian economics. 
*Keynesian economics being known in bitcoin and libertarian communities as money printing. It was implemented as a regulatory device within the economic shortly after the great depression.*
2. Inflation has an accelerating effect on our economy. *If you take away that 2-3% inflation or reduction of cash value you are directly taking away an incentive to consume and invest. Consumption and investment being an fundamental aspects of economic growth.* 
Just on the point of economic growth, people often get up-in-arms when you start talking about wanting economic growth. But I'd like to point out how important past growth rates have been for the average world standard of living and the technological development that we have reaped. The rate at which we as a society add to our collective intelligence is related to the rate of economic growth. This progression is fundamentally important to our lives and future as a species. And while future developments may not be seen as important now, the continuance of capitalism and technological development will provide individuals with greater choice and better quality of life.

Are you an investor or interested in Bitcoin for its social value? As an investment I wouldn't recommend investing much in it. It's future is far more uncertain then other investments.
But if you understand it as a more efficient method of transaction. And you believe it will be a more widely accepted currency in the future, then surely it's worth buying.

Thank you. I've said this a few times, there is a severe lack of economic studies relating to bitcoin. And each time I ask economic questions relating to bitcoin it's a ghost town.
I'm not an economic expert but there are surely some issues with bitcoin as a monetary system. And that includes the decentralisation removing the Keynesian aspects of our current economic system. Governments being able to influence inflation though creating money has had a considerable stabilizing effect on the economy. It may have been the reason we didn't enter depression after the 08 crash, jobs and economic growth could never have been turned around so quickly without it.

Great! Can't wait to read the points you make related to the deflationary nature of bitcoin as a currency - my biggest hangup with imagining bitcoin as a national/world currency.

No economies are collapsing. Chinese markets are reacting to prices which grew too fast. Greece and the eurozone will adapt, possibly by legislating on consistent fiscal policy to match the consistent currency and monetary policy.
But I agree with your sentiment - bitcoiners who think that company values are bubbles and wish for economic hardship for their personal gain are selfish and misguided. Economic growth benefits us in the short-run by providing wealth and high rates of employment and in a profound way by allowing society and technology to progress at a faster rate.

I haven't seen a single rational or insightful economic look at bitcoin. Zero discussed on this board about the economics of deflationary currency and risks involved with the loss of Keynesian economic powers (government influence on money supply). Since governments could print money, we have had a faster growing and more stable economy. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 10:24:27
Thanks for replying. Seems like the bitcoin community isn't that interested in the economics (very important for its value now and in the future). 
Deflation isn't necessarily bad and economies will still function with a deflationary currency. And I do believe bitcoin in the long-run will be deflationary. With full world adoption, population growth rate may be greater then the rate of new bitcoin being added to the economy).  
Deflationary currency may come lower investment returns relative to inflation/deflation rate, this puts (temporary) negative pressure on investment markets and immediately lowers the value of companies and bonds. There are a lot of effects to be explored in economics when it comes to a rise in deflationary currencies, it's the most important discussion that we are not having on this board.

The basis of the price of anything is what the market believes it's value to be. You have to understand that bitcoins environment is more dynamic and open to change than a major currency pair or blue chip stock. The fact that just a small fraction of people use/care about bitcoin is a testament to that. Bitcoin's market is small and the potential expanding of that market will have more influence on the price than the consensus of the current market players.
Have you made BTC trades based on tech analysis? I've looked at it on a technical basis since 2012. I always analysed on the daily chart and it never did what the technicals would have had be believe. Maybe it could work on a shorter timeframe but I'm pretty sure the margins with bitcoin exchanges is too high to expect profit from short-period trading. Anyway, I'm interested to hear your experience.
@_date: 2015-11-28 00:25:35
haha make sure you get other sources. A broader group of people would yield a more accurate result. Basically what I'm saying is that almost everyone here will be in favour of bitcoin and answer with that bias.

In this community there was a lot of buzz around the BTC investment funds. These funds adds no value to bitcoin other then potentially leading to a higher price. 
The true value in bitcoin is as a better means of transaction for humanity. As a decentralised, decreasingly deflationary currency bitcoin would change the world by bringing a new economic environment.  
I'd love to see some discussion and research into what effect bitcoin would have on inflation, societal growth and economic growth. Seems as though we would need a more bitcoin-adopted world to accurately answer bitcoin economy questions.
@_date: 2015-11-28 00:21:48
Tech analysis CAN work in markets where there are a lot of institutional traders. It's different for bitcoin, the average trader has a larger impact and there are whales who can have large impacts on price. 
If you just look at the history of BTC price, less-common tech analysis techniques like fib retracement/expansion and even trend lines would have failed to predict the majority of past price movements. 
I think price supports/barriers - previous highs/lows could come into play if you're a trader. But predicting with tech analysis is arbitrary.
I don't mean to be a dick, this is just my opinion.
