It's hard for me to keep track, but what's your outlook on Bitcoin as compared to SgtFuckFace?
For some reason, I have the two of you combined in my head as one persona.

Interesting. What other subcultures do you laugh at? Bronies? If so, have I got the video for you!

And yet, there are tons of Bitcoin gambling sites that exist with users (or else we wouldn't see the weekly post about some teenager who last his dad's money gambling).
