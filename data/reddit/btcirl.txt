Have used these guys to buy a couple of things on Amazon.co.uk using BTC.

I've been a lurker here for a long time and never felt the need to register an account until now. This is absolutely amazing, huge props to you for being an awesome parent and props to your son for his enthusiasm!
Best of luck to the little guy with his presentation! I've just sent a little to even his balance out to 0.30 BTC. ;)

Ah 2weiX, it's certainly been a long time! It seems we have resolved the Western Union problems by beating them at their own game!! :D I've sent you a message in any event, it would be great to catch up. And thanks for the response!

Awesome, I look forward to the response! :)

Haha, amazing! :D That's so great that he's thinking like that already, it really speaks volumes about you as a parent. Major kudos to you SiON42X! The bracelet is really cool too (I'd be lying if I said I wasn't stumped as to how he makes them!!) - I went to the store to buy but you don't have international shipping set up so I can't purchase just yet.
I'm in Ireland and checked out shipping on the USPS website. $9.45 for "First-Class Package International Service" with a large envelope. I'm sure it would fit in a small envelope but figured I should price a little higher to be on the safe side - I can imagine the backlash if I was ripping a 9 year old off on postage costs :P.
If you're able to add Ireland as a shipping option I'd love to buy it and I think it's a very fair price indeed! :)

Striving to improve his products at age 9 - I'm blown away by this guy!
No confirmations yet on his first sale but here's a Tx ID for him to check out:
I'm not making him feel like a straight up businessman though, he IS a straight up businessman.
Good going Andrew! I'll post a picture when the bracelet arrives so you can see your product out in the wild, and thanks very much for making it for me! :)

That's one thing that concerns me about BIPS. We were originally intending to go with them before their recent issues. Thanks for weighing in!

That's a really nice gesture but I wanted to send that over as a little encouragement for what he's doing and I couldn't accept something in return for that. However if he's willing to accept payment in BTC for a rubber band bracelet I'd love to pay for one! Ask him what he thinks is a fair price and he's got his first sale! I think it'd be awesome to have something made by "the Bitcoin wonderkid!" :D

Yup, gone to processing when it hit 1 confirmation. :) It's awesome that he's got it all ready to go, he's definitely running a good show there. That last bit brought a smile on, that was very thoughtful of him!
I have to say I really am so impressed that a 9 year old has just managed to sell one of his creations to an international buyer without any government interference, registration or payment problems - and with just a sprinkling of help from his dad, of course! This kid is going places and you've definitely got him on the right track. Again, major kudos to you guys!
