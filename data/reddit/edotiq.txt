You sound like a pain to hang around but let me try why people may dislike you:
You talk in a condescending way about someone who seems to not know any better and get defensive since it is about a topic you like. You attack a man with a proven track record and sound pseudo smart and your statements hold no value. When people call you out on your shit you get very defensive and cannot let go. 
This is all just my assumption from reading the comment chain. Maybe you are as I described, maybe you just had a bad day and in fact you are not. I honestly don't care, just trying to give a perspective since I don't feel the replies to your follow up questions satisfactory. The user straight out just attacked you without providing any substance himself.
Have a good day!

Imo a short after 22k is suicide. If we can hold 16k for 48h without a dump below that, I can see btc rallying to over 22k easily.

When USD crashes now, it will take the crypto market with it. When times get hard, people pull out of speculative investments first. Then stocks, bonds, funds etc

I am really curious about the general sentiment of the sub right now. I bought into 16k usd and am pretty chill about it. But people trying to rationalize the current drop or trying to convince others that everything is fine screams insecurities to me. Are you really not afraid right now?
I'm half in fiat right now because it eases my mind. But I can imagine that people who are nearly 100% in BTC are getting anxious.

Thanks for giving insight on your thoughts. I really appreciate it.
I've been in BTC since 2012, so I witnessed much worse crashes, so I'm not too worried. but I'm curious about others.
I see a lot of comments telling people to "buy the dip" which is imo very selfish and irresponsible. They are basically telling others to secure their own investment.

Earlier in the comment chain, you complained that people downvoted you instead of replying. So, I thought I'd chime in and give you a perspective of why they may have done so.

I think this is game theory. By being 2 steps ahead and acting before the realization hits, you can capitalize on it. If you think other traders will sell also and it will create a sudden downwards spike, you sell with them and create the downturn momentum.
The message doesn't necessarily create panic in itself. It is people acting on expecting it to create panic, that may create the panic.
Sophisticated traders do this what is called a "stop hunt". They will force people to their stop loss levels or better yet, try to trigger margin calls and forced liquidations.
For more information about Game Theory, read up on this experiment: 
It is pretty interesting how people try to gain an edge over the market by acting on expected outcomes instead of the current events.
I have closed a long position yesterday, that I opened 1 day before. I will close my next long as soon as we hit 17k dollars. It is a big hurdle that we need to breach. In case it does breach 17k and builds up momentum, I will take part in buying in at 19k. But if it again, will lose steam at the 17k hurdle (like the last 48hours) then I still have cash to make other moves in the swings inbetween.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:07:21
My numbers were hyperbole I have to admit. It could even be lower. If you google coin lending or ICO scam, you can see a lot of people in poorer nations capitalizing on the recent bull runs. You can see what gets upvoted here. 
I don‘t know your experience, so my outlook is based on my personal experience. I hope yours is better than mine. The people I used to tell about BTC only turned around after reaching ATH after ATH. And the first thing they ask me was not: “Can you tell me more about Bitcoin?“ It was: ”If I give you x Eur now, how long will it take until it is worth y Eur?“
Out of over 50 people I used to tell about BTC, only 3 are left with whom I can have a conversation about BTC where it‘s not about the current price. Maybe I am a bitter person, but I am heavily disappointed in the community.
I am glad that people like you, who still believe in the vision, exist. I appreciate that you take your time to educate other people. I gave up on that for a long time.

You are 1%. 99% of the people here don‘t care about the technology or the implications of a decentralized currency.
99% here are only in for the easy gains. Look at the quality of the content this community produces and upvotes. People like you (and me) are remnants from the 2011-2013 era. We care about the philosophy, vision and change that it could bring. Blockchain has already disrupted how we think about transparency and trust, Bitcoin as the first cryptocurrency disrupted the fundraising space. But don‘t assume that this is true for most people here. Sadly the biggest part (or most vocal part) of the community just cares about the price and nothing else.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:33:18
I think the guy you are replying to is just lying or he is a trader and doesn't care much about the philosophy behind BTC but making a profit.
If he's in for the longterm, it doesn't matter much if he buys at 18k or 17.5k, so why stagger it? He could just go all-in  and it won't matter if he believes that BTC could rise even further. Staggering your buy order and risking an asset to rise above the buy order is too much risk for someone who intends to hold longterm.
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:52:34
What recovery?
Most people here have never experienced a bear market. Welcome to reality. It will have bull runs, followed by bear markets for the next weeks. I don't know why people think that the first upswing was already a recovery. It did not even scratch the 17k resistance. 
Will it kill Bitcoin? Most likely not. Will it shake up a lot of the new blood? Hell yes! People who have experienced multiple crashes since 2013 know how this most likely will play out. This is a dead cat bounce until it can breach 17k and 20k again. I don't see the next rally starting before we have climbed over these 2 barriers.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:19:31

But I don't believe in the vision anymore hence my sell off. I will invest the money to pursue a passion or build up a business I can believe in.

How does this shit get upvoted in the BTC sub? Max cap is 8mb and not every block == 8mb now. Old blocks will not be touched, only future blocks can be filled with up to 8mb. And 8mb blocks will have more transactions recorded, so what is your point? You feel the need to shit on blocksize increases but the current transaction backlogs are okay for you? How delusional are you? There are lots of problems to all current solutions and instead of wasting time for this shit, people should actually put their time to find a solution. But no, memes and shit talking are more important.
What is the point of this all? Do you feel so insecure about BTC that you felt the need to make this shit post and garner reaffirmation of your believes? People like you are ruining Bitcoin.

Don't try to time the market. You bought at x price because that's the value you assigned to BTC at that given time. If we all could predict the tops and floors, we'd be rich. In hindsight, it always seems so obvious which move would have been the better one.

As my parents are immigrants in the country I grew up in, I found it pretty huge to be able to send any kind of money around the globe for &lt;1USD in fees. There is a big liquidity problem in emerging markets and workforce exports are a thing. For example, does South Korea contract people in Vietnam to work in manufacturing for 5 years. It's the Vietnamese's opportunity to earn enough to escape poverty when his 5 years are over. Same as Pinoys, Myanmarese and other Asian workforces working in Dubai and sending their earnings back home to family.
Also, I was a big believer in the vision of decentralized money that cannot be stolen from you by inflation or frozen bank accounts. For Argentinians and Venezuelans, it is impossible to save money with the inflation rate of 20%+.
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:09:28
I'm in BTC since 2012. I don't think it will fail. Technology wise, the price is way ahead of the technology and current development. So I do think that the price is heavily inflated. BUT Bitcoin has a valuable brand and following that gives it strength AND value. I am disappointed in the current short comings of BTC but I really hope that it can be useful and great again. I miss the times where merchant adoption was heavily celebrated and every step a good milestone in the right direction. Nowadays it's just price price price which is not healthy. But I don't think the price will crash anytime now. In the future if there is no milestone reached and solution to the fees deployed: probably yes. Will it recover? Yeah, most likely. The community behind BTC is strong.

I compare BTC pre 2014 and post 2014. For me, it seems as if the vision and whole community changed a lot. I don't necessarily dislike change. It's just that BTC seems to have a lot of different kind of supporters for various reasons. Back in 2013 the community seemed to be more united and sharing a common goal. But this probably was bound to happen as soon as it exceeded a certain threshold of users/investors. Now there are a lot of different faces to Bitcoin supporters.
Just my impression. I took a break from following crypto in 2015 and just got back to it couple weeks ago and the change of culture is huge.

Problem is, you can‘t accurately predict the next spike. You have to set investment goals:
1) do you want to have a high risk/high reward gamble? Just hold and maybe recoup your initial investment at x% growth and hold the rest as a golden ticket that paid itself
2) is USD profit as a side income your objective? Then buy the rallys and sell every x% run up and plan your next  move after you have closed your positions. To be longterm succesful you need to be able to commit to your strategy and not get emotions doing your decisions. 
3) one time USD profit: set your goal (for example downpayment for a house) and sell when you have reached your goal
4) Is your goal to increase your crypto holdings? Just buy and hold. It‘s impossible to predict the top, but sometimes, you can find your timing near top and sell it. Just be patient and buy the dips with x% crypto gains in mind. Or if timing the market is too hard for you (it really is damn hard) and you have lots of liquidity, then hold, buy the dips, as soon as it recovers, sell enough to recoup your „dip money“ and keep the profit in crypto. This way you don‘t need to time the market but are still liquid to make moves in case big things happen. One could argue, why not just buy and hold with your money right from the beginning? Well, sometimes things happen in our lifes (a disease strikes us and treatment may be expensive, or your house just burned down) and it‘s imo very stupid to tie up too much of your equity in something that is as volatile as BTC. You may invest right at the top and a crash that needs weeks to recover happens. But you may need liquid cash in the next 3 days.

What adoption though? BTC had multiple bubbles and crashes in its life time and every time people said "This time will be different. This time its adoption driving the price". In 2013, in 2014 and even now.

I'm talking about traders who are anticipating both falls AND rises. I'm not talking about people who act on panic. There's a big difference here. 
I sold at $200 and bought back at $160 in 2013. I could have bought back at $65 but hindsight is 20/20. It's still at a profit. In 2014/15, I sold at $700 and bought back at $500. I did not sell the absolute tops and did not buy the lowest bottoms. Why? Because it is impossible to predict the minimas and maximas in the movement. But you can predict trends and profit on them.
This time, I bought too early and it sucks for me. I want BTC to rise as any other here too, but for the short term, I have locked my liquidity unecessarily. I still have a couple thousands on the sidelines I will throw in, as soon as I feel a reversal coming but that's not now.
What I want to say is, for successful traders, it's not about calling the tops and bottoms but about predicting trends. I don't care about missing out on a bull run if it means that I can increase the safety of keeping my equity high. I'd rather not run into a bulltrap but wait it out and be patient. Panic buying and selling is for suckers.
When you buy at 1k, you don't sell at 500. Either you sold at 800 or you don't touch your investment any further. I'm playing with 30% to make decisions. If I did not make a move before the price had a 30% change, be it up or down, I will sit it out and not act upon it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:42:22
If you can afford it, maybe keep a ratio of 70/30 or 80/20 in a cold wallet and don‘t touch it. With the smaller amount you can have fun playing the market. In the end, holding will be probably more profitable based on the assumption that BTC will go up in price infinitely (a big assumption but good risk high reward ratio and worth it imo) but having a small sum at the sidelines for trading can actually be a lot of fun. You will learn (and maybe lose) a lot. But don‘t forget, failing is part of learning and never chase losses. Good luck to you!

Spent around 50btc on Silkroad before it got shut down. Spent another 5 btc at Silkroad 2. No regrets, without the darknet markets BTC wouldn‘t have come this far now. It was the first real world usage for BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:39:01
Same for me actually. I loved Bitcoin in 2012 and bought in big time in 2013. 4 years ago, this sub was all about: Merchant X accepts bitcoin, this is good news!
Now it's just memes and circlejerking the price, ATH after ATH. I remember how you got downvoted when you called it an "investment" and not a currency. Now people only talk about an investment since as a currency, BTC is failing with it hitting hard limits.
I actually sold all BTC as the vision I bought into does not exist anymore. I hope BTC can go back to its root but I doubt it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:37:51
I think people really have short memories. I remember when Darknetmarkets helped to get Bitcoin being proven as having usage in real world services. People were acknowledging Silkroad‘s part in all of this. Just one year later, people denied Silkroad‘s influence on Bitcoin awareness and dismissed it wholeheartedly, saying they don‘t want Bitcoin being associated with it.
Then during the 2013-3014 run, people were talking about adoptions, merchants accepting Bitcoin, Bitpay’s role in all of this, Overstock accepting BTC. It felt really as if Bitcoin could take off. People hated the word investment and were advocating for Bitcoin to be used as a currency.
3 years later, people only talk about Bitcoin being a „store of value“, no need to be used as a currency etc etc. There is no issue because Bitcoin is digital Gold.
People forget what made Bitcoin what it is in the first place. And they willfully ignore the problems that is making Bitcoin actually going backwards now. By losing its utility as a currency and real world usage, it is now nothing more than a big ponzi scheme. Speculative mania replaced problem solving.
Discussions about technology and adoption were replaced with ATH circlejerks, memes and hostility against anyone who dares to talk about the problems Bitcoin is facing now.
All in all, I am heavily disappointed and where BTC used to be something I truly believed in, it is now just a trading vehicle for me to make a profit.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:46:03

@_date: 2017-12-20 15:59:06
Back then I made a mistake, I tied up all my money in BTC and when it crashed after gox, well no problem, you don‘t sell you don‘t lose right? That works in theory, but I was illiquid as fuck and had to sell some of my holdings at a 50-75% loss. In the end, I did profit, since I still had a lot until last year but never again will I repeat the mistake to tie up too much of my money. Being illiquid can be stressful as hell. Nowadays I just trade to increase my fiat networth. Will I become a millionaire by doing this? No. By buying and holding the chance is probably much greater than with trading. But do I want to become a millionaire by holding? Nope, there are a lot of opportunities out there. I prefer to be liquid now and being able to afford to try a lot of different things without worrying about paying rent and cost of living each month. You just gotta try your best and be passionate about it. If I‘m lucky, I can still be a millionaire by building up a good career or starting my own business with the skills I acquire out there. Who knows what the future might bring.
To each their own I‘d say.
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:51:54
Survivorship bias. It could have gone either way. How are the people feeling who held pets.com or VW? Holding in a bullish market is indeed the superior strategy, no doubt. But in a bear market it is a high risk gamble. You basically hope and prey for things to get back to the next rally. Most people here haven't experience a bear market ever. I held during Gox and china ban. I sold at the last Gox shenanigan and bought in back a lot more BTC when it trended downwards. I did not try to time the market and buy the floor. I actually waited for the next uptrend and did not maximized my profit but this is okay! I sacrificed potential profits for security. It could have gone both ways and BTC could have been worth nothing. I was extremely lucky that it climbed back up. Being lucky does not make your strategy (or mine) better than any other. But I think it is irresponsible to advice people to hold without any further context. For some, it might be better to decrease the risk (and potential profit) by selling and switching part of their portfolio to something more secure. Bitcoin is an extremely high risk investment and there is nothing wrong with seeking more stability in your portfolio.

Because like 95% of people who buy bitcoin are in for the money. If it tanks and you are quick to pull the trigger, you can make money. If it rises and you are quick, you can make money.
In a bull run, holding is 100% the smart choice. You will profit by doing nothing but being patient.
In a bear market, you can make a lot of money by selling and being patient. I don't think that holding in a bear market is the superior strategy. Selling and waiting on the sidelines is. In case it goes up, you just buy in and swallow the loss of btc in favour of increased security. In case it falls, you have not only secured your liquidity and equity, you also have the resources to make a move, when you feel the market is stabilizing again, increasing your holdings by a 1.5 - 2 fold, which is insane. No other investment vehicle can provide you with such gains and comparable low risks. This is why people sell, they expect others to sell also and then make a profit.
People don't think it will kill bitcoin, but people think this is a great opportunity to make money. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 09:09:09
You can't lose more than your margin deposit though. That's not how it works.
You make a deposit and increase your buying power. It makes sense for traders but not for investors. People don't invest on margin unless they are stupid. Traders don't hold positions over longer terms, hence using leverage to increase the possible ROI on the volatility we have.

Yeah, we've been in a big accumulation scheme for weeks. I'll just wait it out. Not confident enough to make any longterm predictions in what will happen. I'm biased and leaning up not because of my passion for trading (as you rightly pointed out, only liquidity and volatility matters to me) but because of the huge accumulation I am seeing when we are trending down.
It's hard to say which levels will increase the money flow into the market. The problem with low liquidity is that no one wants to sell at these price levels as you have said. So the whales fight each other and try to trap retailers and force them to cover their margin longs.

Support couldn't even form because the pump to 9.9 left such a big volume gap that no confidence in the prices between 6.9 and 8.5k exist. That's how you get such a dip with a steep slope.

Yeah, see some of my replies. There's been some heavy accumulation ongoing for approx 2 weeks. That someone will not let btc die

Yeah, bitmex is also called the bitmex casino. They offer trading with btc deposits only, no fiat.
Their perpetual swap has no expiry and there are always 2 quarterly future instruments available. I think they released bi-weekly options too last week but I haven't checked them out yet.

You seem to miss that they are capitalizing on the rivalry to promote their shitty exchange.
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:41:21
The good thing about steep slopes in price trends is, that they exhaust faster than a gradual rise/decline, so a temporary bottom is probably near.
The market is mostly psychology and algorithm driven. When you watch the charts the whole day, you can spot recurring patterns. The bot that pumped us from 7.9 to 9.9 for example buys 0.02, 0.024 and 0.026 bitcoin in a 1-5 seconds interval every time he is flipped on.
There is so much blatant manipulation going on which is imo not a bad thing. All markets are rigged (traditional and crypto) but the infrastructure in crypto is not sophisticated enough to support HFT, so for now spotting certain bots is possible.
Also there has been a huge accumulation play going on, so someone (dunno whether it's an organization, a hedge fund or just someone who is crazily rich) has been buying a shitload of btc while the price has been tanking. I spotted the accumulation starting around the fall from 8.8 to 8.6 and has been going on periodically. While Bitstamp, Finex and Bitmex had huge selling volumes for example, someone bought a shitload of BTC on Gdax with minimal selling volume still tanking the price.
These out-of-sync actions between exchanges are easy to spot when you observe them and split the volume by buying and selling. Also sometimes you have huge volume and little to no price effect which means that someone knows what they are doing. It's not easy to build or liquidate a big position without affecting prices.
I reckon as soon as that player has completed his target of desired asset position, we will see a price increase. The only problem with that information is, that it's not much applicable. Their accumulation timeframe could be months or years even, so trying to copy him and buying when he is, for a quick profit, won't work. But it's reassuring to know for a certainty that Bitcoin is not going to die.

For example you want to open a 1btc position on Bitmex. You choose 10x leverage and hence only 0.1 btc will be used as margin. If the market moves against you for 9.5%, the auto liquidation will kick in and bitmex will keep 0.5% for their fund if the engine perfectly executed it. If the book is too thin and there's slippage, bitmex will cover it for you.
The only instance you can get account liquidated is if you use cross margins.
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:06:28
Buy the bottoms and short the tops. Ez ¯\\(ッ)/¯ 
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:28:48
The rally was bullshit in itself. Shorts at an all time high at 6.7k. Long:Short ratio on Bfx: 40:60
Then the shorts got liquidated in a glorious 1k green candle, bringing the ratio down. The rally to 9.9 was quite artificial in itself.
Just a small hint, the long/short ratio is currently 60:40 
@_date: 2018-05-29 13:14:11
You get liquidated at 5% margin levels on bitmex and that's it. If there's left over coins, they'll get added to bitmex's fund. If slippage is too big, Bitmex will take over the costs for you. But their insurance fund has only been increasing, so it's quite profitable for them to offer this model.
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:24:08
Bots tend to respect them. So it's useful to increase your chances of success instead of blindly buying/selling. But it's only one part of being a successful trader. Risk management is even more important. With a solid risk management strategy, you can make money even without TA. You just need the price and some intuition.
With TA you can increase the probability of not being too early/too late. It's a useful tool especially for scalpers. Different exchanges show different behavior. Be careful where you apply your TA

the lending on bfx is purely p2p. On bitmex there won't be a margin call but a forced liquidation as soon as your position is too heavily underwater. Check out  on twitter. You can see how degen the market is. Sometimes a 50-100 usd swing in price liquidates people with 7 figure positions.

If bitfinex margin is blowing your mind, take a look at bitmex. It's a derivative exchange and has the highest btc trading volume since January. Bfx offers 1-3x leverage whereas bitmex offers 1-100x leverage. Most of the trading volume in btc is in derivatives and not spots. Speculations make more than 60% of the current demand.

Bitmex's volume took over since January this year I think. They are the most liquid exchange I have used so far. You can market order a 50-100k contract position with little to no slippage when you trade perps.
Futures are different though. The u18 contract with expiry in September can have slippage with just a 1btc order.

You are Gox.
You owe A, B and C 2btc each, makes your debt 6btc.
You owe D, E and F $300 each, which makes your debt $900
Your funds are frozen and you can't repay D, E and F, your actual assets are 4btc.
You could take 3btc to stamp and sell them for $300 and repay D, E and F.
But you would still owe A,B,C 2btc each, but only have 1btc in your wallet.
Or you could unload 3btc for 300goxdollars each, D, E and F each buy 1btc which get credited to their accounts, but you don't owe them any dollars.
Now you owe A, B, C 2btc (=6) and D, E, F 1btc (=3), makes your debt 9btc but you don't owe anyone USD anymore.
Now after the announcement btc tanks to $50, A,B,C,D,E,F are suckers and sold when it hit $50. Now your debt is 0btc, but $450 (9btc sold for 50usd/btc)
You now take 2 btc to another exchange, sell them for $250 each and can repay everyone and still have 2btc and $50 extra

If the market matures and more brokerage firms offer derivative BTC products, you think the hedge funds will trade spot when derivatives offer much more liquidity?
That's in a scenario where spot is very limited and they can't find sellers who are willing to unload 10k+ BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-14 10:26:13
Last time that happened we still had growing trading volume, higher price fluctuations etc. The market was still in price discovery. Now we are in price compression (declining volume, declining volatility) Not to say that I don't agree with buying here though. But for different reasons than you have I guess.
@_date: 2018-06-23 14:29:19
for every buyer there is a seller and vica versa
@_date: 2018-06-14 04:25:34
Hardforks that create a significant alt coin are the exception. I'm just saying that world economy / 21,000,000 is likely to not be the future price of BTC since the supply can be diluted with derivatives that provide way more liquidity than the real thing. I think it's not realistic that demand is driven by the prospect of the hardforks. Calling it a dividend is misleading. BTC is not a company.

25k is a fucking joke. Rent in Germany averages 700€ for 65square meters. So you have 500€ left for food, clothings, electricity.
I waited tables and made roughly 30k/y with tipps. That's the minimum you need in Frankfurt (Main).
Food ~300€/m, electricity ~35€/m, that alone is 1035. No way someone can support a family with 1200€/m

Problem is: the btc you send will come from
various addresses in your wallet, when the sum is too high.
Your Wallet A has  
•Address1 with 0.1btc  
•Address2 with 0.2btc  
•Address3 with 0.1btc  
You want to send 0.4btc to Address4, then your wallet will use btc from Address1,2,3 to send to Address4. And I don't like to reuse adresses, fragmentation is even bigger in my wallets.

Dogs can sniff everything, even double vacuum packed drugs, but the feds don't have the time nor do they have the ressources to get every package sniffed. The vacuum packaging is so humans can't 'sniff' the odor (sry, don't know which word to use, as English is not my mother tounge). All in all it's quite easy, the stealth is often really good and made me lol a couple of times. You can ship mushrooms and lable it "cooking ingredients" or you put it in a DVD housing and use sth like an amazon lable.

23y old, 1550€ (~2000USD) invested at about 23€ (29USD).
Asset change is at ~60% since my first investment.
Probably gonna cash some out at 10.000%
I got in at dec 2012 when the price was at 9,9€ (12-13USD).
I just invested 150€ at first and did some trades (buying at 10€ and selling it to people for 12-13)
When I made 75€ (97USD) after 2-3 Weeks I decided to invest some more.
Another 150 so I was at 300€.
1st of match I bought another batch (25BTC for 26€ or 33USD each).
5days later the value raised. This was right before the small crash.

still buying, got a in when the price was 16usd so I've still got a lot of room to break even, should the price drop.

Never invest more than you are willing to lose.
And isn't bitcoin a longterm thing? The first thing I'd do when the prices dips 30% would be: buy more, in fact I buy every dip here and there so just chill out.
We don't need those noobs anyway, if they want to sell: let them sell, better: encourage them to do so, in this business you need some ball of steels anyway
@_date: 2013-03-06 20:26:29
I buy them at bitcoin-24.com and bitcoin.de
Verification on btcde are 2-3 business days,
Btc24 don't need verification as far as I remember

Love the rage in the thread. Try to imagine you ordered 5bitcoins worth 200USD because you wanted to to buy something worth 1000USD on any site supporting bitcoin. By the time you'll get your coins, they are only worth 130USD, but you still get charged 200USD/btc. I would have canceled too.
EDIT: nice downvotes but no one cares to take on the provided example. You would be mad too, if you'd have to pay another 350usd to get your 1000usd item, which makes it cost 1350.

I hate customers paying bills below 20€ with card.
Transaction fee for us (the merchant) = 8cent per dial to the system + 2,5% for Visa/Mastercard // 3,5% AMEX - 
While Cash = 0 fees for us.
Seriously, everybody should have at least 20-50€ in cash when going out.

It's a crappy business modell that you don't get your coins instantly.
When I traded at gox or btc24 I got the coins and payed the current exchange rate, not 1 week later. How usefull is bitcoin then in the situation I described before? So you have to pay another 350usd to buy your desired item? 
Example: exchanging 1000usd to buy a TV at bitmit. 1 week later when you'll get your coins, they are only worth 130usd each. So you'll have to pay another 350usd to pay for the 1000usd TV. In the end you payed 1350usd? yeah, makes a lot of sense. Stop using coinbase. Having have to wait 1 week with sth that's as volatily as btc sucks.

use a secure password. Seriously, it's hard to get robbed. Chances you get robbed in the street are much bigger. Sure, you never have your whole money in bar in your pockets, but chances are so slim, that you'll get your wallet.dat stolen and someone bruteforcing it.
Encrypt your wallet and you should be safe.
