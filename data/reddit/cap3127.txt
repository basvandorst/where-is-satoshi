Yeah.  Though price did rise a few bucks since that "leak."  Sign of things to come?

the QT wallet is pretty easy to use... and well worth not losing your BTC over.  It takes me a while to sync too, but once you have the blockchain  downloaded, updates are quick

Awesome title.  But no real substance.

No online wallet is safe.  Get a local or paper wallet.  BTC was not designed for cloud storage, and cloud wallets give a central point for hackers to target.  Get a local wallet.

You are what is wrong with BTC.  Go donate it to charity and stop messing with BTC.

Flash drives are cheap.  Encrypt, password lock, and make a couple copies.  Throw em into a firebox with your birth certificate.

Let's say you work in NASA's testing division.  You assume there is oxygen in every room.  One day you find a quiet, dark room and take a nap.  Turns out it's a vacuum chamber, and it's testing day.  Woops.  
Most assumptions are easy enough, and safe enough to make.  The problem is, when your assumption is wrong, the result is catastrophic.  Bitcoin was designed so that you SHOULD be holding onto your private key: it is how ownership of BTC is acknowledged.  Also, some of these people lost serious money with Gox.  You wouldn't trust some "Jon Doe" with your life savings if you knew he had trouble with money in the past, so why would you treat him like a bank? Likewise, why would you trust an online wallet, Mark Kerapeles and Gox?  At that point, it's your own fault.

It's asymptotic: the block reward halves every so many blocks, until it reaches a satoshi.  Since that cannot be halved, then it will just be fees

The BTC price is gonna go nuts in about 20 minutes...
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:22:05
Once the news starts getting out people are going to be speculating.  Decisions might be made, etc.  Not saying it's smart or if BTC will go up or down... but this is big news.
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:34:41
Hmmm.  News like this usually affects price.  Lets see if Gox's statement does the trick.
@_date: 2014-03-01 07:32:24
Yes.  If i speed while driving and tell the cop "I didnt notice i was speeding!" I still pay the price (EG i still get a ticket).
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:50:57
I still don't understand why people don't use their own wallets instead of online wallets?  Exchanges have been hacked enough (not to mention Gox's prior signs of incompetency) to make me think storing a lot of it online is a bad idea.
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:46:47
I mean the concept of storing BTC online instead of in your own wallet at any time seems counter-productive: it's not how BTC was designed to operate, not securely at least.

Actually, as far as cryptography goes, BTC could be an excellent way to solve a major problem: factoring.  If someone could develop a way to crack encryption, but hold onto that method for personal gain, perhaps some agencies throughout the world would like that method?  Perhaps providing an incentive would help?  BTC could be that incentive, because somebody with the "magic decryption method" could instantly hash any block that comes out, gaining immense profit.  Or hack wallets, etc.  But also, ponder for a second, Satoshi Nakamoto.  A highly intelligent cryptograpther/technological enthusiast skilled in economics, mathematics, and the technical skill to develop BTC.  I also think Satoshi was not one person, but many people, who have an ulterior motive to just creating an online currency.

An offline wallet with flash-drive backups is pretty dang secure.  And recoverable.  And safe.  
At any rate, most of the options above are a LOT safer than an online wallet.
@_date: 2014-03-01 04:08:39
...in other words, people made an assumption.  Assumptions are bad, especially where money and unregulated things are concerned.

This is postponing the buy of a rifle i really wanted...
