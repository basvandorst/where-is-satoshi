I read it's only about 0,3 percent of the total marker cap. That's not gonna do a whole lot.. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:06:12
Good point. We'll see where it goes, but I'm not to worried about it in the coming months. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:28:43
Ha I was super happy when I saw this, then checked my account and saw I sold because my stop loss went through.. Stupid. Should've set it lower. Oh well, I'll get back in soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:35:33
Bitstamp of you're in the eu. Gemini for us. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:20:36
I love it, tried the recovery process and it worked. Awesome device 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:35:58
Yes and what's interesting is that I hear from a lot of people on forums etc that money they sent to coinbase isn't coming though on their account since Friday. For me the same but then Monday. So that's kinda fishy.. Dumping and not letting people buy because there's no fiat getting through to buy.
Edit: waiting for my bitstamp verification. Fuck coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:32:32
If large amounts of people move their coins out of there it's a big deal. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:58:22
Well, just hodl right? :) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:36:30
Hahah shit is getting real, pun intended. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:08:46
Bit if you've got the 24 words, you can just recover them on another device without the pincode as I understood. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:34:44
All good here.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:14:48
Lots of money moving into alts. Also maybe people taking some profit for holidays / Christmas. We'll probably be up again soon. Just hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:38:18
Not buying any time soon anymore. So either they have implemented segwit by then, or bitstamp etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:16:32
So much this. Was just laughing like a manic over my coffee. But fuck it, hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:26:23
Thx for the clear answer! Sending my BTC from nano ledger to gdax in a couple of minutes would be fine, and hour or more would suck for trading then. Guess a good alternative is to 50/50 it. Half for trading, other half for safe keeping. I'll order a nano ledger and experiment. Thx again for the explanation.

1 min
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:56:14
I understand what you mean, but don't you think if they see a ton of people moving their coins out and not buying there anymore as well, it will send a clear signal? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:36:17
No idea, gdax eats the fee. And was high enough to go fast i guess. They got that going for them, which is nice.. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:36:57
Yes, we're slowly creeping back up again. We lost all the panic sellers, and now we can focus on steady growth by implementing lightning and more segwit adoption. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:34:08
Was a butt clenching 10 minutes, but we back in business boys. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:03:02
I ordered directly from ledger, but you doing should be fine with ordering from Amazon. But.. Beter safe than sorry for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:09:50
You don't think the actions of the last days, and the truck loads of support questions they get about this doesn't show up as a blip? If they care is another question, but I do think they noticed it. They said that they are implementing in 2018 now.. For what it's worth. (not a lot) 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:27:13
They also are a shit site that randomly goes down when something happens or halt trading. Let alone the whole bcash story. Easy if you ask me. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:59:00
Hey man, quick question! I've got my BTC sitting in gdax now because I trade quite a bit. Would it be safer to move it to coinbase and then back to gdax for trading? And secondly, if I would get a ledger nano and store BTC on there, how fast will I be able to get it back into gdax to trade? That's the thing that holds me back the most. If it would take  long my trading/selling opportunity is gone. Hope you can answer my question, thx! 
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:31:28
It didn't actually, been staring at that wall non stop for the last hours..
Edit: Now at 7 hours later it did! Pop the champagne guys, to the moon we go!!

It's insane. I love it, but it's crazy. I've put in a stop sell order at 11.5k euro's to be sure, will get in again if it dips under that. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:20:01
I did! ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:38:50
Quality post my man! Thx for the wise words, I've got to say I know this, but it's good to be reminded of it every now and then :) 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:35:27
So I took out my BTC from gdax into my hardware wallet. No shapeshift done or anything. Can I still do that and is it really necessary? I'm from Europe btw. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:55:01
But it's already on the hardware wallet.. So shapeshift and then back to the same adress (my hardware wallet) will make a difference? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:04:22
Better than doing nothing and keeping my coins there and keep spending money there. If it's gonna hurt their numbers, they might do something faster. What have you done? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:12:50
Bitstamp 
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:18:35
Yes!! Fasten seatbelts boys and hodl tight!! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:36:53
My stop order didn't go on gdax, and now I can't cancel my order. Great. Wake up call this.. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:55:23
What is a hardware wallet and how does it work? You can't trade anymore then right? Sorry, BTC noob. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:47:40
Oh man, those feels are coming back! 
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:09:58
To the moooooooon
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:09:12
We back baby!
