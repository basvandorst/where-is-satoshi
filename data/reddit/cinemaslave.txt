UPDATE: Turns out I just had to wait a little bit. The funds got sent back to my wallet and it sent it with a higher fee. It was detected as a double spend but the new transaction was confirmed first, which invalidated the original. 
Lesson learned: Don't be cheap with your fees. Thanks for your help everyone!

Is it theoretically possible that a BTC transaction will never get confirmed? As in, the money might as well be considered lost because it keeps getting rebroadcast somewhere along the way but no miner confirms it?

I don't understand why it's showing the transaction starting today. I sent the money literally over 4 days ago.

None of these suggestions are really an option for me, so I guess all I can do is wait? That's a little frustrating, the money is already 48 hours late. 
Though I guess I should have looked up recommended fees instead of letting my wallet decide.

So would it be safe to say that the transaction will *eventually* be confirmed? Or sent back to the wallet?

I did try this but Electrum told me that I don't have enough funds.

In terms of the actual Bitcoin themselves, they don't just disappear. If you there is an unconfirmed transaction it will either get confirmed eventually or get dropped by the network, allowing you to send again. 
If I'm correct, the btc will eventually go through to the seller, as for the seller not refunding, that's honestly a problem you need to sort out with the seller, not the Bitcoin itself.
