Because we already use a numbered system to track the year? Taxes aren't due until April, so it's not like you have to do any work during the holiday because of the year ending.

There are literally an infinite number of ways to use bitcoin for tax avoidance. Obvious ways are not paying taxes when buying/selling things. But you could also repatriate offshore funds - buy bitcoins with the money and then buy things with the bitcoins. You can also just dump money into bitcoin throughout a year and report lower income than you actually generated (because you’ll actually have less money in your accounts). Sure, it’s all technically illegal, but people used to do the same thing to hide money by storing money in PayPal long ago (and many other ways in history).

The reason why this happens should be pretty obvious. It's used for tax evasion. Hide your assets by the end of the year in bitcoin, pushes the price up and lets you store the value. Cash out in the new year and do whatever you want with the money. Repeat.

Hahaha "buy more", great advice for what to do with regards to an unbacked, unregulated speculative asset as it's crashing!
A fool and his money are easily parted.

If you’re avoiding paying taxes for the 2017 calendar year, you only need the money hidden in bitcoin at years end. You can turn it back into cash right after the calendar changes. You don’t need to worry about tax avoidance for 2018 until later in the year. Notice how bitcoin takes a hit every January...
Edit: for example. 2017, I make a million, hide it all in bitcoin at the end of the year and report 0 income. 2018 I want to use that money, so I take it out. Make 2 million in 2018, hide it all in bitcoin, report no income. Take it out in 2019 to make more money with it. Etc. This is just the simplest and dumbest way to do this, of course, but it should illustrate the point.

In the USA, taxes are due for the calendar year, so the tax year ends December 31st. Additionally, 65%+ of US companies use the calendar year as the fiscal year. I don’t know where you’re getting your info from. Have you ever paid taxes in the US? If so, you’ve been doing it wrong.

Bitcoin’s value directly correlates to the general stupidity of the human population. This is why it keeps going up despite being quite obviously useless nonsense. Never bet on the population getting smarter.

You will still be liable for any coins you purchased and their appreciation. Just waving your hands and saying, “you can’t prove which wallet I transferred them to” does not matter. People go to jail for tax evasion all the time even without the money trail being complete.
You can also be legally compelled to provide the transfer record (and private key) and not obeying such an order would land you in jail.

This is almost the dumbest thread I've ever seen.

If you’re showing that you sent them to another wallet, they not have the info on that other wallet...

Safe haven? Good luck when the IRS seizes a shitton of wallets.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:21:37
Sure, maybe. You’re assuming that the only way the IRS could figure out the owner of a wallet or other account is if their name is on it.
In all likelihood, you’re just using a major exchange and your name is on it though.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:14:41
Maybe they did and are just exploiting the rest of you?
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:21:51
Oh yeah? Have you ever used a bank account (or other account tied to your name) in a transaction to buy crypto? That’s been tracked.

Monday? We’re here now motherfucker.

Your attempt to evade the laws of extremely powerful nation-states is laughable. They can track everything you're doing.
