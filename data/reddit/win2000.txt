I don't think it matters what the limit is in 2036 at this point in time. This won't be the last hard fork ever. So if we have new knowledge after the next 10 years we can make a change in one of the next hard forks way before 2036 comes around. At least with the current proposal we have headroom to grow and miners still can produce smaller blocks than the proposed limits if they desire.

It doesn't have to be a paper wallet. An extra computer (old pc or cheap netbook) with internet explorer disabled is enough.. the only applications that can connect to the internet are the wallet software and windows updates. easy &amp; secure.

If you have a large harddrive and a fast internet connection i'd suggest using the original client that downloads the full blockchain and represents a full node.

Then it is secure enough... for now that is.. no one has lost a single coin by having a dedicated system.. yet... that might change in a few months. once there is a way to infect a pc just by connecting it for the internet and stealing all the bitcoins then it is over for the bitcoin economy and fast adoption. How do you expect does average joe store his coins? everything in cold storage paper wallets? how do i buy anything online? where do i redeem the paper wallet? should be a clean system too... manually transmitting and signing the transaction? i doubt average joe will do that anytime soon. trezor is pretty good.. but still expensive.

Love them.. got my first coins there.  
Bank transfer but you buy first and then wire to the seller. Price is locked.

Good idea but not a fan of this. I like ninite, but with sensitive applications like wallets, i prefer to get them at the source and verify the security certificate upon installation. (in the UAC box that pops up)

It says 4 weeks or more. That is a different saying of "minimum 4 weeks". Theoretically they could say 24hrs or more and still be right. :/

 - Don't store more than pocket change on your main computer. Have dedicated storage for your coins and sleep well at night!

just the usual skepticism: not legal tender, "lol", etc. Just do a ctrl-f and jump the results. you should have an overview within 1-2 minutes skimming through.

A hardware wallet with backups will work too (trezor). A cold wallet is not even needed. My rules are: no online wallets, an extra computer with disabled internet explorer. (can be an old pc with at least 1GB of ram or a cheap netbook) and the only application on there that ever connects to the internet is the wallet software and windows updates like described in the [Bitcoin 101 for beginners]( If this method is not secure enough then bitcoin really has a problem getting widely used.
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:24:44
Both.. Everything... I have no idea... all i know is that in currency markets trillions in volume are traded. And if they start trading pairs like USD/BTC or EUR/BTC then things can get wild.

Be glad you only lost 10 dollars.. do some research before spending any money. [Here are some sources to get bitcoin - depending on your location.](

Vote for Bitcoin-24 for all the EUR traders out there!

tumble everything... like keyword spamming every email for the nsa. then everything is "suspect". method becomes worthless.

Time for new exchanges to get more liquidity:  
  
   
  
  
competition is good!  
Edit: also 
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:03:38
same... thats my strategy. The only way to lose is when bitcoin goes under completely. I don't care if it crashes in between...more cheap coins
@_date: 2013-04-07 00:42:30
More exchanges for those who don't want to wait:  
For the United States there is   
For Europeans trading in EUR I can recommend   or   
Or use any other exchange listed here: [Bitcoin Exchanges](
@_date: 2013-08-22 10:01:00
Just ctrl-f bitcoin. There is a lot going on...

Coinbase, campBX or localbitcoins.com

Use another exchange. Liquidity might not be as high as on Mt. Gox but if you are not daytrading its more than enough. [Here are some Bitcoin Exchanges.]( Great ones are Bitfloor, Bitcoin-24 or Bitstamp.
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:23:09
relatively easy. just 2500 coins.. there is a sell wall of 1300 coins on bitstamp right now. then just 800 coins somewhere else... distributed on 2-3 exchanges or all on bitstamp and the price would rise to $410

A list to start is [here at YellowCoins.com]( But it's far from complete. If someone knows more global or popular companies feel free to add them or send them to me.

I'd like to spoil it for you: yes we will see these posts in the future. :)

This! It is a decentralized currency and decentral trading adds to its stability. I wrote in another thread:

Don't use coinbase to buy/trade coins. They are not an exchange, they don't have an orderbook. The are just selling coins directly so they also can run out of coins. [Here are some Bitcoin exchanges](  that get you started. Depending on your locations there are some good ones. Mt Gox, Bitfloor for the US and Bitstamp, Bitcoin-24, Bitcoin.de for Europe and EUR denominated trades.
@_date: 2013-11-01 23:24:49
no, but your post makes it seem that you have given up on waiting for your coins. i would only use known sources to get bitcoins.. like known exchanges (coinbase/bitstamp) or localbitcoins.com

Can you show me a case where coins were stolen on a computer where nothing but the wallet software can access the internet?

The two biggest exchanges currently are [Bitstamp]( and [Mt. Gox](

I see your point. But lets be realistic. If it gets that bad, then large-scale bitcoin adoption isn't going to happen anytime soon. Apart from that OSX is pretty good for that purpose and as easy to use as windows for the average person.
@_date: 2013-11-03 10:39:58
When someone says Bitcoin is too expensive, i say it is too cheap and show them [THIS]( to put things into perspective. There are Investment firms that manage 20x the volume of the whole bitcoin economy/market cap. Even Twitter is worth nearly 5 times of that.

A small hardware-wallet appliance would be great. Maybe on a Raspberry Pi basis with open source software on it and built in display and USB port for a keyboard...

For beginners there is also worth exploring...
