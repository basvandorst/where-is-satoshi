So I don't see any reason why this wouldn't check out just fine

Ha, I sold yesterday at $190.  Then later last night I saw the price had rebounded to $170 and I had had a few drinks so I purchased again at $170.  This morning I had a lot going on and forgot that I had done that, barely sold out again at $100 whenever the price was there.  Still haven't lost any money necessarily, but sober me is much better at handling my money than drunk me, go figure.

I'm still waiting for around $220
I just logged into my BitFloor account, it shows my balance as 0 for everything and it shows no pending withdrawal.  I checked my CapitalOne360 account where the refund should have been processed to and that shows no recent deposits.  Am I supposed to expect a check or something?

I can say the only "fee" would be that they do a credit check and automatically open up a line of credit in your name for overdraft protection.  I'm going through the setup right now and I believe I can set the credit line to 0 so that I don't have it, but then I could potentially be at risk of overdraft fees if I were to start using this account for other purposes.

Umm I didn't, I could lose it, I don't really give a fuck

So I guess to clarify, on blockchain or any other wallet, it represents my total account balance as a single amount, when in reality each wallet is separate from each other.  So if I have 1 in Address A and 2 in Address B and I send 3 to Address C, there is record that AddressA+AddressB funded the transaction?  In this case would it be better to use a fourth address to collect all the funds then send from that address to C?

Can someone ELI5? If I have two addresses and receive money at both at the same time are they linked to a single transaction?   I don't see how someone's identity can be deduced if they can change or create their bitcoin address at any given moment.

I had 4 bitcoins in bitfloor, and that's the end of that story
