The bitcoin fanatics have become a bit religious about the whole thing and fail to see bitcoin as what it truly is. Mark Karpeles is smart enough to know that bitcoin has no intrinsic value and is not backed by a government nor army. He was free to do what he wanted.
Having the document 'leaked' at the same time the other exchanges banded together and MT Gox goes dark. It's all too convenient for me. 
Smells like fish to me.

Psychopaths are certainly clever, aren't they?
According to the psychopath himself:
[Tuesday, September 13, 2011] [03:03:10 am] &lt;MagicalTux&gt;  and bitcoin users are known to be naive and dreamers hoping for a decentralized world, easy to trick into traps
He's been waiting for this moment in time to screw the world of bitcoin.

Thanks Charlie! It's too bad we have 'spoilers' like the US Feds to mess with everyone. Bitcoin doesn't have a long term shot because 'they' don't like the competition. Psychopath must control everyone and everything. Thumps up to you!
*spoilers - enjoy making life miserable for others

So this so-called Plan was LEAKED to "the two-bit idiot" and we should all believe this? Oh come on guys, we're smarter than they are. 
"The two-bit idiot" is being used as the stooge in this skit. He was given this ?inside info? to do with -- spread it far and wide.  Of course, MT Gox can just sit back and relax because it didn't come from them...... um, yeah right. Or at least they are not admitting or denying this doc. How convenient! 
My BS meter went off the moment I laid eyes on this. Mark is full of it and so are his lame minions.  But according to him, we're all just stupid and will fall for anything. 
AS of April 1st, MT GOX/GOX.COM  is done - FINISHED. There is no re-branding, it's a JOKE!
