The mining pools don't want to accept 0.0001 fees for mining your coins lol. Throw a 0.001 fee and tx goes through. hmmmm.

lol wonder why
@_date: 2016-12-02 15:13:59
hahhaha you really think it works like that? You clearly don't understand BTC lol do a test... send one tx with a low fee and one with a high fee.... scrub get some knowledge... my high tx took 10 mins my low tx is on 30 mins and counting...

Stop trying to rush things. BTC will grow and become what it will grow and become to be.

I think it's clear who doesn't know shit about the topic lol... Do what I just did earlier... Send 2 tx. 1tx with a .0001 fee and 1tx with a .001 fee and let me know what one shows up first ;)

Stop being broke mofo's and spend a couple extra cents to support the network and your payments would go through... Everybody using minimal tx fees smh

Tx would go through a lot faster if ppl upped the mining fee, or are you to far gone to understand how btc works?

KYC makes things terrible for some users.
