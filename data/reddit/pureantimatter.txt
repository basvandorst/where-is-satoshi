I’m giving memes for Christmas.

I think the psychological impression of a relatively legit sub $1 coin is really appealing to a lot of people.  Especially people that are getting a bit concerned that Btc growth is slowing.  I own Ripple, I bought in at ~$.71. I didn’t even consider selling btc to do it, though.  
Btc is soft right now because money is tight dues to the holidays.  Some people took profits to pay for gifts or to be able to take time off from work. 
Wait until people catch up after Christmas and start getting tax returns.

I bought at 9500 and it dipped. I felt the same way you do but I held it and am glad I did.

The good news is that these clowns can’t keep up the attack for nearly as long as I am prepared to hold my btc.

Bitcoin hits a new high and pulls back a bit. Then it hits a new high and pulls back a bit but it never drops to the prior pullback value. And the high keeps getting higher, too. 
 It isn’t a bubble, the value is what it is at the moment.

The USD is backed by nothing at all. It is more virtual than bitcoin.

That is my plan!

Thank you for that.

Baited and clicked.
 I already have an EZ bake oven but if you decide to unload your BTC cheap please let me know.
