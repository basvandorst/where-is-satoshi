Thanks for the research and information. IIUC [10.1,) are vulnerable for the CM 10 releases although given the pretext of the question OP was probably not installing CM 10. Moot point seeing the age of the post. Cheers.

Good timing for a question. There was a 0 day vulnerability released a few days back for Cyanogen ROMs allowing MitM attacks. I wouldn't keep anything on a phone that I wasn't willing to lose.

His motive is to expose a flaw in mining where gaining a majority of the hash power of the network will allow reseting the block chain. While this flaw is currently being fixed by people a lot smarter than I, it doesn't appear that the exploit can be patched (or more so that the patch can be distributed to the majority of the user base) before the attack commences. It doesn't feel that this is a stunt for namecoin as the prices have plummeted since the news came out and most of the major exchanges have closed transactions in order to prevent loss of currency.
I was a pretty early adopter of namecoin and have enjoyed the community. It has never felt like a money grab but instead a look into what can be done with p2p currency technology (the whole idea of a decentralized dns system). Whether MtRed should offer NMC mining or not would be a decision I can't answer. Merged Mining has been a hot topic for a while and it would seem that BitcoinEXpress's motives have been to prevent merged mining. Merged mining allows for new cryptocurrencies to harness the hash power of larger and older currencies (like bitcoin) and prevents the ability for users to pump and dump. Here's a wiki on merged mining:

AFAIK the blockchain will be modified on block 19200 in order to supported merged mining. He is trying to get enough hash power to replace the blockchain with his own (reset to block 10000) which he will try to do on block 19101.

just like the popularity of Bitcoin, this post's popularity has exploded within a very small group in internerds (FTFY)
