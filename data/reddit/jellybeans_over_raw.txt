Most people do not have 250 k

Why do they give you bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:58:56
If it goes up 10x like in your post

This guy is trippin. Never seen a blunt in his life but is a so called expert.

Trying to sell high buy low 
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:03:54
It's really up to you but sometimes Ill wake up in the morning and see it went up like 800 or so. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:31:22
Surely this growth is unsustainable

You'll never lose the amount of Bitcoin you purchased unless you sell it. Only the value in USD or whatever currency can go up or down

Thanks, I didn’t know. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:09:55
definitely regret selling high last week and waiting for a dip that never came 
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:24:15
Seriously that is just an asinine statement 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:03:54
Don't think about it in the terms you're talking about

But did he actually do it cause that just makes me lose faith in everything 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:48:12
Thanks I guess ill just hodl it won't make a big difference in the scheme of things when we're up there. Just trying to capitalize on the dip if I can 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:06:56
I think my idea here was to just short it and end up with more in the long run 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:43:04
If I bought in with 150 usd and it's now worth 200 would I be smart to sell now and buy back in later? Does anyone see this dip dropping below 8?
