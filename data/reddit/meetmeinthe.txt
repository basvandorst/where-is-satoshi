Classic buy high sell low. But seriously that sucks. Hope you invested that money in alts.

Lot of alts going down as well. Perhaps people selling out to btc to get ready to cash out january 1st for the new tax year. Maybe combination of after christmas buy just like last thanksgiving as well...

Stagnant then sell jan 1st for tax purposes causing a slight dip. Bull run after in 2 weeks. 
Elliot waves bull run dead kek bounce fractals bitcoin!! Happy holiday!!!

Still a lot of confused people out there recycling a bunch of misinformation about bitcoin. Hopefully overtime the media and wallstreet will legitlamize crypto and bring in a lot more people.

Work a part time job and invest what you can afford. Save for tuition money aside...

Terrible. But if you did keep it active you probably sold at a much lower price with all the volatility.

Litecoin is $79. Short term percentage wise i think it will grow faster than bitcoin just because its so undervalue.

Dont worry. Of all the people who invested early. Not a lot of them can hodl till this day. Even if you did buy, its very hard to hodl until this point. Market goes up and down so much, you probably cash out at a certain point already. Also the second best time to invest is now...etc...
