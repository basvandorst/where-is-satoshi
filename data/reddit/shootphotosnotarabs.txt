Give us your money, not your problems!"
New motto. 
I'm going to use that. thanks @_date: 2014-01-20 06:16:00
That's a freaking outstanding idea. I have a few people helping me but it's always good to get info from a number of sources. 
For instance I allmost got charged 10k to set up something that i have just been informed is basically free.

If you have a shop, like I do, then all you need is an iPad and to train the staff member to do the transaction. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 06:21:42
I don't know what that means. 
If you could explain that would be cool.
@_date: 2014-02-21 12:20:02
And I assume you thought I was just one of these cash in types.
I'm not. My choice of words was poor but to be turned away so vigorously is not wise in my opinion. 
I hope crypto currencies get traction as well. I would appreciate your advice as someone with experience ten fold to me. I have a mountain of information and products to sift through and I will be back here asking for advice. 
No advice is ever acted upon without additional research, of course, but I would like to think that some good concepts and products can be extracted from this sub. I know abuot the hive mind that /r/ gets so if you know I other forums or information sources then that would be much appreciated. 
Out of interest you mentioned that you thought Bitcoin wasn't ready. At what point do you think it will be? And what forces would get it there if places likeare not good places to garner investment of all types? 
Note: I understand artificial price value due to heavy speculative investment but is that the only reason to deter investors? I mean the price still gets driven up by them and they still get educated about how it works.
I mean the price not dropping to $100 a coin when all the speculators started loosing (gox, SLK 2) surely demonstrates that the currency can survive panic selling. 
If speculators create big up shifts periodically is that detrimental?

Hey there, I have no idea what I'm doing. 
To my bitcoin virgin eyes and ears this post's TL;DR is:
Fuck off noob, your going to loose money here. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:55:43
Gox was the best known to me and many others, because it was the biggest. 
People say "do your research". 
Pretty epic to get up to speed on such a new idea, people seem very hostile if you don;t kniw exactly what your doing. I still have no idea which wallet host and exchange to use, you can find information, articles, reviews and serious warnings about every service I have looked at. Some is good news, some is bad news. 
It seems like if you pick a service and pick an opinion of that service at random you can find information to validate that opinion online.  
@_date: 2014-01-20 05:01:23
Every-time I turn around this shit gets simplified. I almost payed a consultant ten grand to set me up with a machine and a whole host of security stuff. 
Now after xmas the game has changed...... again. 
Thankyou for the help. Also I expect Bitcoin to be a very small part of sales. The biggest function it will provide is getting us as business operators schooled up and on board with the online currencies that are already shaping the business world. 
It's a pretty amazing time.

I was hoping there was a supportive community that could point me in the right direction, identify safe steps etc. 
But thanks for your input.  
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:14:08
If this had an answer it would be nice. Seems very relevant.

We are taking about physical hardware that produces qr codes to be scanned or directly debits a wallet via smart card. 
The other listings can accept online btc payments via a website : )

So name the top three exchanges that you would use?
@_date: 2014-03-06 06:44:34
Thankyou. 
To clarify your confusion regarding my exasperation at the comment by I think it's wrong to brand people who lost money on exchanges as at fault. I tire of hearing the blame leveled at a group of novice traders embarking in a world first technology. 
I'm afraid that you can't shout about the incredible new technology, and then shout about how the failings of the technology are the fault of the uneducated users. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 01:35:19
My shop is setting up to take Bitcoins today and [this design]( helped make our first staff shirts.
Thanks for the design and we will send you over a fat tip for your efforts.
I snuck my own little logo on the bottom left ; )
PS: Thanks to for all the advice and contacts to get our shop plumbed into the Bitcoin world.
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:12:56
Its no problerm for us to hold it as bitcoin. initaly anyway as we can't see our monthly bitcoin intake exceeding $100,000.00 AUD a month for a few months. leaving it as bitcoin is fine. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 05:24:19
I have been reading about the currency for three months, been to four bitcoin Brisbane social meetups and I regard myself as completely void of information regarding Bitcoin. 
The first step is sinking in your own money to see whats up and get an idea of how it works. By behaving in the way you have and discouraging the new and "Ignorant" people you stand as squarely in the way of the currencies development as possible. 
The only reason I will take this on and trade with it within my business is becasue I wasnt people to be able to use it in my shops. The more people I have to use the currency the more I will tool up to take it. 
If you pushed me away from bitcoin like you tried to with your condescending insults then that is one less person to add to the community and spread it further. 
I don't know anything much about this whole thing but at least I know I'm clueless, it seems to me that you may not realize that your not as clever as you think. 
Thank you for your time but a number of other users have put me in touch with the appropriate contacts. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 07:35:48
Out of curiosity, do you think bit coin has a future? 
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:11:34
So when are you buying more? When do you think it will reach the bottom of the dip?
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:07:55
Fuck I'm sick of that bulshit. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 01:15:36
I had a "accepts btc" sticker stuck on my shop and I looked it up to see what the fuss was. 
Taking btc next week. I posted about how to take btc on my business facebook wall and I got seven emails asking to place orders with btc. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:07:24
I own/run the outlets in brissy. The factory and online shop are run out of toowoomba. I need to show my partners that people use bitcoins and the investment is worth it so I may keep you on file with a discount code and when we set it up I can at least get one sale on the first day. 
We do biltong (In fact we make enough biltong every day to drown a small horse.) and I would make it a BIG discount to prove we can have customers on day one. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:51:03
I run a pair of shops and I'm attracted to the zero fee element and would like to incorporate this into my business as seamlessly as possible when the time comes. . 
There will be a global shift to decentralized money in the next decade and I want to be involved and aware as it changes. I want to understand the concept, uses, limits and risks. 
I told one of my service staff that wants us to take bitcoin. I said if he got one hundred people to sign there name up we would do it but not until he had a hundred signatures. It took him two days on his delivery route. Before my business signs up, i guess I better to find whats what. 
Govt reserve bank of Australia has directed over a dozen staff to generate advisory reports on bit (is that the word) currencies. 
State Premier Campbell Newman has commissioned a report into the regulation of bit currencies and a close friend of mine has to contribute as she liaises between agriculture and the Premier. (If the Govt gets around to it then I already should have.)
Plus I love the funky little B coins you see getting around. They are so pretty and shiny. 
But. I guess I will just show my ignorant self out. Thank you white Knight of bitcoin, you just saved the currency system from an idiot blindly throwing money into it. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 03:26:10
It puts it on it's skin. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 21:26:09
That doesn't matter. Validating an idea by paying someone per hour and seeing how much trade you do ius better than lumping $20,000 on an atm that you have no idea will be viable. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:26:06
Link? Colored coins? 
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:23:24
Yeah I guess that would put an extra step in the process.

Hi, I have been here for an hour. I have been sworn at twice and am "far too incompetent to be involved". 
Also Mt gox crashing is good. Silk road 2 dying is good. the price drop is good. This place is like denial central and full of rude people. 
This sub is not a good place for bit coin, well at least its poison for new or prospective investors.  
@_date: 2014-04-06 09:18:44
Did you get a qr code printed and use an app to scan it, or did you swipe a card to buy the beer? Genuinely curious.

I have money ear marked for bit coin investment, I have no clues about it. When you say in jest:


It makes me very dubious about the whole idea, whats to say the next step is people taking money at the exchange. After all they are just anonymous people half-way across the world exchanging my untraceable virtual currency. 
You say it to make others sound stupid, but it just paints the whole Bit coin concept as fucking insanely stupid. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:57:29
In all honesty is this a bot that confirms payments somehow? I clicked the "What's this" but i need an "explain like I'm still wet from birth". 
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:13:34
One reply says you can, one says you can't. One has 6 up votes the other has seven. As I hover around and debate whether to buy bit-coin this is worrying. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 07:00:33
As someone in business "falling through' is exactly what he meant and exactly what happened.
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:29:32
That's the OZ service provider? 
There was one oz provider that tanked and then re appeared again. Was that coinjar or affiliate? 
@_date: 2014-02-21 07:26:52
Today I have opened accounts, moved money, generated qr's for products and set up to take payments thanks to other people. 
I have increased security, sent bit-coins to a charity and even sent them to the dude from the Superbowl with the sign. LOL.  
I feel more confident in the operation of the payment method and we will partner with a provider once I am across this even further. 
I have learned a lot through doing, seeing and hearing. I have measured every step, read much of the fine print and have been advised of various pitfalls. All advice is checked (searched) before being undertaken. 
I am now going home, I will drink a beer and talk shit to my mates later on tonight. I will talk about btc show them my computer and likely they will sign up on Monday. Likely they will send the Superbowl guy some money. LOL
The one negative from today is this guy claiming a superiority of some sort and declaring that there is some "real technology" that we are all missing. 
I just wanted to let you know you have been a real downer. I guess there must be some undercurrent of bad feelings in this sub that led you to this position. But as a person just getting it figured out and turning the gears for the first time you have been incredibly negative about every part of what I'm doing. 
I don't really want to argue about what bit-coins use or potential is. I want a high PR value article that says I take BTC now at my business.
I want a cheap way of collecting funds for my internet customers. I want a motherfucking drone to pick product off my shelves and drops it in a cannon that fires it at a Velcro square on someones roof seven miles away after they paid for it with instant BTC, I want it to be automated. 
None if these things are possible if people like you discourage people like me from setting up a wallet and throwing some money into this bitch. 
TL:DR Shut up and get out of the way mate, the grown ups are trying to talk.

Ok, fuck this. Those children are using bitcoin in business. if someone could direct me to a place where I can set it up so my business can take bit coin that would be great. 
I have searched many links but there is no main authority it seems so if someone has a legit link then please share. 
I have been putting this off for far to long.
