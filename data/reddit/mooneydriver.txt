There isn't one.  In this case OP was asked once, anyway.
You've clearly made up your mind, evidence be damned.  There doesn't seem to be much point in continuing to argue with you.

If you read more of that article, instead of the bit you cherry picked, you'd see that you are wrong.  It is extremely unlikely that OP, if this was a sting, would be able to beat the charge with an entrapment defense.
[Here's a good resource](  See the second example.

Natural gas isn't available in many places and air source heat pumps aren't efficient in very cold places.

I think if that was the case he'd try They're a little more free with the tips there.

True, although in a lot of places that is because it's cheaper to shoot and bury or rape and release.

As bad as the police can be here, things are far worse in most of the rest of the world.

I've been subscribed to this one for a long, long time.  Anyway, who are you kidding?  It's plain as day to everyone that you're a blowhard who doesn't own a significant amount of any cryptocoin.

I think most members of this sub would be embarrassed by your childish comments if they saw them.  Fortunately Reddit is working correctly and you're being downvoted into oblivion.

That actually doesn't fit the legal description of entrapment.  Enticing someone to commit a crime, fucked up though it is, is not entrapment.

USD is used much more widely than the euro.  Try to buy your way out of trouble somewhere in the third world with euros sometime and you'll see what I mean.
Edit: Thanks for the downvotes!  It's so brave how you tried to bury my comment without actually taking a risk by expressing your own thoughts on the matter.

Why anybody would buy from tiger direct is beyond me.  They have appalling customer service.  They also lie about stock levels.  
I ordered a graphics card a few weeks back that said "ships in 24 hours".  I called customer service, they said it would ship in four days.  Called again, now it is 10 days.  Called again, now it is three weeks.

Hey, thanks for that.  I needed a way to insult the teenagers crapping up the tubes without insulting homosexuals.

Why do you have 1/3rd the upvotes of the conspiracy nut below you?  The likely explanation is that they got in way over their head and took way more orders than they can deliver in a reasonable amount of time.

Do you have any proof that they are "sitting on $4M worth of product"?  That the chips have been fabbed and packaged, but are just sitting in a warehouse?  That would be much more troubling than the likely explanation: manufacturing delays / limits in production volume / some other supply or distribution chain bottleneck.

You know that you weren't actually downvoted 209 times, right?  Reddit Fuzzes the vote count.

You're confusing the 1% of a certain pool of money OP is talking about with "the 1%".  Let me guess, you're a teenager?  Reddit is rife with summerfags tonight.

Probably not your guy.  Read the top comment: he's a troll who made this story up.

Great advice in early 2006 then, when they were still cost competitive.  You can get a machine that is in every way superior for the same money now.

So you make 600,000 a year but you need donations to run a small game server?

You claim to have nearly half a million in the bank and you're soliciting donations to revive your hobby business.
