Everything from houses to food, it's just more difficult to find an accepting party.. but they are out there. Done believe me? Google it. Many condominiums we're sold in Dubai for BTC.. 13 or so each if my memory serves me correctly.
If you really wanted. You could live your entire life from BTC, if you can convince your landlord (or just own your own place) to accept it as payment. The only thing I see being difficult if paying for utility services (electricity and hydro).
As for a store of value. It is. 
Arguably not a great one, as you said it has a volilitile nature, but you can still store your money in it. You can at any time (given an internet connection) buy BTC and sell your same BTC irrigardless of you gaining or losing money, it's still there. Doesn't matter if it's storing it well or not. It's still keeping it in place. 
It's like me buying sand. Shitloads of sand. Now I have and own all this sand. All I need is someone (luckily for Bitcoin there's a lot of people willing) to pay me back for my sand. 
Don't be ignorant

Still up a little over 100% YTD.. people get caught up in the day gains/losses and don't see the bigger picture of what's happening
