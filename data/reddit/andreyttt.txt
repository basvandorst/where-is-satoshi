... and I think it’s great that we’re here observing the very beginning of it! Altcoin and nocoin people must be either blind or ignorant to just watch LN grow and not go bullish on bitcoin.
LN cannot possibly have a negative impact on bitcoin. By mathematics we know that means it’s either no effect or a positive effect ;)

I'm a UBS client.
The DAY they deny my exchange transaction to me I will smile, set up a meeting to close my account for good and just use crypto as much as possible to buy plane tickets, pay online, pay to my friends who use it. I can also buy food (at least pizza) with it here anyway with takeaway.com.
Fuck banks.

How did you figure this out? �� 
By selling thousands worth of coins?

Don’t mix up the bitcoin community and the Reddit bitcoin community. Two different things! 
One cannot just make a repo on github and be happy LN will be largely adopted soon, make an FAQ, and expect the masses to try it out because it is NOT trivial to clone a repo for an average person and no one cares what a channel even is!
Make an app. Make a website. Make a tutorial video with pretty pictures. Not a mega thread that none of our friends will ever read!

What’s your point? I didn’t assume to buy btc illegally. The PAYMENTS with BTC are illegal, not buying it at an exchange. You can’t prove someone used btc to pay someone.

And Facebook is E-Corp right?

You don’t need to wait for confirmation because it assumes it will be validated with the fee you paid. That’s how it works in Switzerland with the train ticket CFF machines

Take advantage ;)

The average Joe can install an app on his phone and is capable of scanning a QR address at max... So what the hell are we all talking about here? Wake up for a sec, devs
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:41:39
his statement still true tho
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:08:47
Just closed both of my accounts there. What a stupid company
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:25:00
Is it gonna be the same « not ready yet » at 10000 nodes as well? :D

It had some humor to it mate :)
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:44:22
Good to know!:) Thanks for the info!

Source please, wanna show to my friends

“Payments are illegal in btc”.
- [officer] Did you pay him in BTC?!
- Hmmm no.
- [officer] ....ok.

Exactly my thoughts too, the problem is I need the specific dates on which it changed... From what I see the correct dates are those where the "interim" points are.
@_date: 2019-03-25 19:07:57
Np! It’s also possible to buy BTC at our train stations btw :)
@_date: 2019-03-25 17:02:52
Agreed. Although it’s called Digitec
@_date: 2019-03-29 22:19:52
Wrong. In Switzerland one can buy bitcoin via native railway ticket machines in most railway stations.
@_date: 2019-08-15 23:42:14
Does anyone know any website/web app monetization platform who pay in BTC? Big thanks
@_date: 2019-04-19 19:54:49
This. Everyone.

Take any course about Internet or networks please. See power law

You ask 1000 random ppl and see results.
@_date: 2019-09-17 16:27:28
I did double it :p But also already spent it hehe
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:17:45
The only moment I thought it was a very reasonable time to buy (around October 2018) we’ve all seen what happened.
I remember I bought on a Wednesday, then my Friday night was practically ruined ahah
@_date: 2018-04-02 07:36:44
Did you look at the graph tho?
