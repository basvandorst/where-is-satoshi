What if you get paid in BTC? Looks like people are already doing it: 
@_date: 2014-04-11 20:04:25
I love what you're doing, great idea. Have you considered having separate BTC addresses for each feature/enhancement? I feel that users may be more inclined to donate if they know it will get the specific feature they want implemented sooner.

Used this service recently. Works great.

Or it's based on IP address and you're on a shared network, such as at work or school.

Thank you! Will be paying it forward.

You must have missed the news... 
@_date: 2014-05-14 23:26:55
Yeah. People need to learn to get more familiar with escrow and multi-sig services. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 00:18:54
Great idea. You may want to consider signing the bitcoin address with your PGP key, or something of the likes, to prove the address and book is yours. Who knows if somebody will host their own edition and put their own bitcoin address.

Tx != Confirmation
That's literally the whole point of this thread.

You can also choose to keep it as Bitcoin if the business/person you plan on paying also accepts it.
Additionally you may choose to keep it as Bitcoin if you don't trust your money with the bank, or if your currency is undergoing massive inflation.
Just remember if you start to accumulate a very large sum of Bitcoin: follow recommended practices for managing your private key (bitcoin wallet). This will help you mitigate the risk of lost Bitcoin due to viruses (hackers) or data loss (broken computer, house-fire, website crashing, etc). You don't need to worry too much about this right now, but if you have all your money as Bitcoins, you should do some reading around to learn some of what I just mentioned.
It really isn't very complicated I promise. It usually takes me about 10 minutes to teach somebody what I mentioned above. If somebody had never used a traditional bank before, it would also require some education. Welcome!

I hope this will be open source.

You did a good job. Try not to say 'basically' so much though.
@_date: 2014-08-01 01:10:48
I would say look at it relative to all of the money you have overall. If Bitcoin is say more than 10% or 20% of it, I would recommend making sure you know the basics.
I would recommend using [Electrum]( as a wallet. You should write down your 'seed' and keep a copy in two separate physical locations. The 'seed' it is what is needed to recovery your wallet funds. Just make sure nobody untrusted see's it.
Then to get even safer, if you would like to store a large amount for months or years at a time, you should look into making a [cold wallet]( and keeping a couple of copies of that in different locations.
I want to throw out there that I think blockchain.info is also worth using especially for beginners. It's pretty safe, allows you to hold your private key and make a cold wallet, but it's still a web wallet at the end of the day.
You can do further reading here: 
This is definitely more than you need to know at this point :). With what you have right now, if you keep your funds in a blockchain.info wallet and wrote down the 'seed' or printed a backup you will be fine. As a precaution though you may want to turn on 2 factor authentication for any web wallets like blockchain.info.

I really like this. The response should be: the blue kingdom because they can just print more money.
One flaw though. You said that the payment had to be equivalent to $100, opposed to 100 mBTC and $100 respectively. So as the blue emperor prints more $, the mBTC will be worth more $.

So Facebook is being used for ID? Why is any ID required at all?

Seems like it: 
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:25:49
Thank you! I will be sure to find another commenter to pay this forward to.
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:58:19
Even more benefits can come if you can begin to start paying some of your suppliers with the Bitcoin you've been payed by customers. Multi-signature transactions may also be very helpful in this situation, depending on how reliable your suppliers are.

The most important developments have really been anything that makes bitcoin easier and more secure for the average person and business. This includes hardware wallets, bitcoin ATM's, platforms such as coinbase for businesses, deterministic wallets, easy to use multi-sig implementations. Many exciting things, but it's only the start.
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:42:38
Was your Electrum wallet encrypted?
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:32:09
One of the most interesting things about this is the BTC leads to a wallet which currently has about half a million $ worth of BTC... And over $35 million (62k BTC) have gone through this wallet.
@_date: 2014-04-11 17:04:52
Good analogy. Just further proves the point...
@_date: 2014-03-24 18:43:15
blockchain.info has a web wallet ( which works well with the iPhone, and supposedly they don't have access to your private keys since your wallet is encrypted.
Personally I wouldn't keep more than a few mBTC in there though, in the same way you wouldn't carry 100's of dollars in a fiat wallet around with you.
Edit: Correction. Thank you frankenmint.
@_date: 2014-04-08 18:37:53
You make it sound like by being able to ID your customers, it protects them in some way. If I'm in control of my own BTC wallet, and I am only using cash with your ATM. How is anybody going to steal anything from me?
Sounds like the controls are there due to AML/KYC.
@_date: 2014-04-17 14:31:18
It works pretty well on the iPhone. You also get to keep a copy of your private keys, which is better than most web wallets.
