Apologies for misappropriating your comment, to reply to yet another glib post from Frogolocaypse.

no-one in their right mind would accept 0-conf with opt-in RBF unless they trusted the sender ( presumably a small set of total use cases) so not really!
stuck transactions 
whats wrong with "transaction timeouts" + CPFP 
The only "current" use case for opt in - RBF as i see it is to produce a fee market. 
It also surely increases bandwidth usage as one transaction becomes &gt;=2 transactions and probably more as it becomes commonplace to try to find the "ideal" fee for any particular transaction. all this in a time when network bandwidth is "so vital"?
Any mechanism that promotes double spends in any form is not good for bitcoin.

just re read article, at no point does the OP say that the core devs are against zero-conf
but I assume you meant


which it may well be.
how safe is 1 confirmation? is that bulletproof / money in the bank, or 2 ..... the reality is its a continuum.
I don't believe he or I ever alluded to it being "safe" though I personally don't know enough yet, but I am more willing to trust someone who puts their money where their mouth is especially someone who has been in this space for so long.

Prior to my post I had googled to find merchants who accept 0-conf and did'nt really find many, shapeshift will accept if tx meets certain constraints. The french pizza place popped up on the front page. Also in another very recent thread (can't find it now) a merchant had mentioned that they used to accept 0-conf but dont now, was tempted to ask why (but i'm a shy newb). A gift card company apparently accepts it for transactions less than 100 dollars.
so it doesnt look good. but currently this is a subset of a small subset (merchants who accept bitcoin face to face)
I don't know enough yet to really argue strongly for or against 
and would be pleased to be pointed to further reading.
Ultimately the risk (0-conf (if workable) or 1,2,... conf, rbf flag etc) would be handled by the wallet and communicated to the user
I don't like opt-in RBF because at its roots i feel it's an erosion of the key bitcoin breakthrough of no double spending by creating a culture of "its ok to change the recipient of a transaction once sent"

And yet its what the vast majority wants and number 1 deal breaker when I have demonstrated bitcoin to anyone. as evoorhees states its not "safe" but he believes the risk can be managed. 
You may well be correct and manageable 0 - conf is just an unobtainable dream without LN etc.
I am sure plenty of people thought the same about The Byzantine Generals' Problem, and so didn't work on a solution.
Apparently businesses are accepting 0-conf
Il Bugigattolo, just dropped into my lap.
I am sure there wont be many saying 
"but the blockchain is not for pizza!"
ultimately scaling is what is important. what use is a small decentralised network where the primary use case is to feed bitcoin whales which is probably less use than a large more centralised network that everybody participates in. 
Hopefully we can have a large decentralised network but I feel the only way there is through adoption.
@_date: 2015-12-03 02:51:46
I didn't mention large amounts, the op was talking about managing risks. I was replying to your statement that opponents of 0 - conf are not inflexible and dont believe 0 - conf should not be used

That's true today with Core or any "Other" client.
The only solution to a Government level attack on hashpower is to massively scale, users and hashpower.
Now how do we do this?
Not by changing PoW, alienating miners or limiting the slow but inexorable growth that has been going on for the last 8 years.

I applaud you for putting forward this possible solution!
@_date: 2017-02-06 06:45:59
It's not an attack vector, that was my point.
What does it accomplish?
* Typically transactions get mined in the next block as we now have larger blocks and the system goes back to **how it was** when the mempool was not overflowing.
* 2 competing chains of 4 blocks with the first block in one chain &lt; 10% bigger than the other 7. ( the bigger the excessive block the less hashrate you engage )
* Typically all but the last 10% of transactions will be in both chains.
* the last 10% will be in block 4 on one chain and block 5 on the other.
* probably worst outcome is blocks take twice as long to confirm (a very good reason for miners to work together and decide on same AD/EB)
one block is orphaned weekly currently. and in the last year we have had 25 2 chain or more orphans.




No money is being screwed up! 
you might get 1 confirmation a bit early.
this happens today anyway as one block is orphaned every week.
tldr: its in miners interest to agree on EB/AD, No monies were harmed in this narrative.

He could only benifit by making **large number/value transactions** that he would hope would be orphaned, but this would be easy to spot (a smart wallet would see the split and warn accordingly).

@_date: 2017-02-07 04:02:57


Correct my apologies for that, I mixed you up with u/Cryptoconomy


From that paper


**Thats 2140**, trying to predict only 20 years in advance is a fools errand, never mind 100+ years.


A fee market.
That fee market is also essential to the health of bitcoin, so why would we want to get rid of it and weaken security at the same time? Its like you are trying to trade me some shit stained rookie card for my babe ruth.
prior to mid 2015 **blocks weren't full, there were still fees**, you seem to imagine miners will just suddenly include zero fee transactions only? 
There will still be a fee market just not an **extortionate** one like the guy yesterday paying a **$10 fee** for a [**$100 transaction](
Bitcoin price needs to increase at 20% per year to keep up with block reward halving. It is currently well in excess of that.
**But most tellingly you want a forced fee market when we are still in the bootstrap phase.**


None of you seem to realise LN scales tx's, users not so much, and the ones that do don't shout about it! 
Is **LN great, Absolutely**. Even if routing doesn't get solved and we only get large centralised hubs
but **LN is not a panacea** and is **not a viable substitute for on chain scaling**


I was referring to the effects of ddos on each client 


This will be fixed in future Flextrans or similar,
but it is a non issue as SigOps are currently capped at 20,000 per tx in BU 1.0 
Any miner creating aberrant block will get it orphaned by header first mining.




both chains would have the same tx's in slightly different order &amp; shifted by EB - median size, the bigger the shift the shorter the reorg, 


They already have it, its just not explicit.




how can you upgrade the blocksize in the future without a hard fork? 
LN on 1MB isn't going to work out as you seem to think it will!


I assume by this you mean hard forking, this only reinforces my belief that a future hard fork will be impossible post SegWit.




unfortunately SegWit is not, "letting the system do what it had been doing for the first 7 years" 
A blocksize increase is!


I probably would be happy with SegWit if I thought there was a realistic possibility of a hard fork later and I thought there was no other option to upgrade, but I am not, not that my opinion really matters.
The most rational argument I can give against current SegWit is..
**I believe it would be substantially different code if it was written with the intention of being deployed in a hard fork.**
and i don't mean shoehorning the SF SegWit into HF SegWit.


It will be slower, with the constriction of 1MB blocks , let the system do what it has been doing.


**One seems crazy and one makes plain sense.**
Now here is your false dichotomy, third option is increase the blocksize!


If you stop assuming rational actors then you'll realize the whole plan is crazy.
Bitcoin is predicated on a majority of miners acting rationally 
It's in the White Paper...

Par for the course, as expected.
where did you state what blocksize you were talking about, as u/Cryptolution and I were talking about Core and BU.
The only way for Core to increase the blocksize without some horrible extension blocks things is to hardfork.
Which they seem dead set against.
and a growing number make compelling arguments that its impossible already see your own u/Lejitz's [Paper](
@_date: 2017-02-06 08:12:05

At no point did I assume altruism, just profit seeking. which is currently the case today. 


You missed the point that the same tx's will be on both chains in a very similar order and owing to larger blocks the mempool will not be overflowing. think pipelining!
with an overspill of exactly how much larger the excessive block was, which cannot be much larger or you won't engage much hashpower.
so. your logic here is flawed.


* Spam attacks mitigated by larger blocks 
* ddos no difference between clients
* the worst part of the excessive block attack you didn't even pick up on, blocks take twice as long to confirm.
this last point I feel is the difference in our 2 camps yours is generally condescending (kids playing in a sandbox) and superior even when your logic is shown to be flawed, I wonder where that comes from? 
and the side I align myself with are happy to point out shortcomings and genuinely want to understand the issues. I must thank u/jonny1000 for being the stimulus that made me think of this.
so the solution here is miners having tight control over EB/AD or they loose money.
The only way to disrupt this is buying more than 50% of the network which is just a 50% attack same as today.


your implicit assumption is keeping the userbase small is the safe route. As I am sure you have heard many times LN scales tx's not users.
I believe letting the system do what it had been doing for the first 7 years is the safest course of action.
Admittedly I am not 100% sure about miners having control of the blocksize. But the more i think about it the happier I am with it, aligned incentives is a wonderful thing. no need for trust or naive assumptions

Only an order of magnitude difference, not worth it then?
in a world where just about any endeavour would be revolutionised by "only an order of magnitude" increase in a key property. it may not be practicle, but to just dismiss it as if its nothing well...
incidentally people say the same about 3tps to only 6tps as if this is also nothing, but in a world that is so competitive that even a few percent improvement can make a world of difference.
@_date: 2017-02-06 08:50:33


I believe this would be the case if miners don't have tight control over EB/AD but I am coming to the conclusion that they have very strong incentives to converge on the same values. It doesn't need to be an actual "attack" to split the network and for miners to loose money if they are on the orphaned chain.
And the attack is mitigated to a normal 51% attack as they cannot co-opt any of the rational miners if they have converged to same EB/AD
@_date: 2017-02-06 12:07:28
For someone who is so secure in their position, you clearly don't read your sub a lot. Do a google search on protocol ossification. u/Lejitz's makes some of the better arguments of the two broad camps 
1 those that support Core
2 those that support on chain scaling as a priority
Good luck on getting Core to hard fork, I honestly wish you well on this unfortunately I have no faith that this will happen.

A continuous attack from a government would end Bitcoin today. 51%+ attack mining empty blocks.


This assumes EB/AD has not converged to a consensus very quickly, and the sort of attack you are talking about **forces this to happen** or miners lose money.


Think for yourself rather than parroting someone else's analysis.
Both chains would have virtually the same transactions displaced by the amount of the EB, which couldn't be much larger than the median or you don't get an amplifying effect of half the network mining your fork.
So **no 5 confirmation** tx will be orphaned at most they will be slightly behind with 4 confirmations, and the situation is very visible to wallets.
* edit u/throwaway36256 brought up non EB chain could be ddos'd and effect it this way. 


chop off the hand that feeds them, bitcoin is predicated on this. perhaps BU skews the alignment but the more I think about it the more certain I am of the opinion that it is in alignment.
What would we do if we had 50% rogue miner today, it would be a PoW change no different if we have a rogue miner under BU.
And if most of the miners see it as in there financial interest to curtail BU because of largish rogue miners we can softfork the offending mis alignment.

I absolutely agree **decentralization** is one of, if not **the** fundamental  properties of bitcoin. 
How much do we have today?


your doing it now! nobody said it fixes it but it would make a not insignificant difference IMO, if the trend is so clear then lets reduce it, are you for that?


can the current 6000 handle the increase?


* if you meant **verify their own transactions** then even with 10 fold increase isn't this ok today.
* if you meant **support the network** at current adoption this isn't going to happen. what percentage of current bitcoin holders run a full node do you think?
and if the lightning network works how many of the countless new users will run a full node?
Adoption is a big part of decentralization its the next level above hardware / protocol decentralization.

what if all the miners double spent!. its not what happens as has been shown to be the case. 
your 0.1% miner would have to have a relationship with the double spender.


once majority chain is ahead of the other (say 10 blocks) the chains **don't interact** and if they don't interact there is no combinatorics 
and if there is no combinatorics it is just a race condition with minority trying to catch up.

@_date: 2016-03-24 01:14:39
A prudent approach, try with small amounts and see how it works with minimal risk. exactly what I did to start.
currently there is a huge "debate" as to whether bitcoin should be either
* **A Settlement Layer** - think acting like gold and only have large transactions. with smaller "coffee cup" transactions on a higher layer. i.e. the coffee house would settle all transactions at the end of the day. this may be necessary in the future as you don't want every small transaction saved on the blockchain which also may undermine a very important property of bitcoin namely decentralisation. 
* **A Payment Layer** - as you experience it now where you can pay anyone anywhere via the blockchain directly with any amount. 
the settlement layer would ultimately be enforced by having high fees $1 $2 $3 $5 .......
Fees per transaction are currently about 4 cents


This was my point. bitcoin needs to onboard people **now** and they are only going to do so with small amounts to start. sending small amounts to themselves and friends to see how it works. 
There are many better explanations of the debate if you google. 
just keep asking questions and experiment.

then my risk is that i will be double spent by you 1 times in 1000 so i have to raise the cost of my 2.50 coffee by less than 1cent


not really, attacker unlikely to use rbf for 0-conf tx as merchant is unlikely to accept it so there is no change in the likely hood of being double spent. 


please point me to this, though i am skeptical as once the majority chain is ahead by any significant amount it is a straightforward problem with no complex combinatorics as the lesser chain just has to catch up by producing more blocks which is statistically unlikely once the main chain is ahead
@_date: 2016-03-22 20:16:31
Unforunately the majority here are well meaming &amp; welcoming but miss the point that what they are saying elsewhere..

You with your $10 start, can do nothing but "spam" the network.

That was tried with XT, could of soft forked down to acceptable blocksize if growth rate was too much.
consensus is ultimately decided in meat space not by the code,
* node operators choose which software to run.
* miners choose which software to run.
* users decide to buy or sell
* and now miners/nodes can choose what blocksize is acceptable without wasting 5 years arguing for hard fork.

The only defence I can see against this type of attack is to massively scale, users and hashpower before they take Bitcoin seriously, see it as a real threat.
see earlier post.
Is there any other defence against a Government level attack?

You don't think that people paying **with Visa** to get their transactions through is not a crisis.


A supermajority BU fork (including economic nodes) won't be overtaken once it has gained momentum.
The minority fork has 1/3 the hashpower, so it has 
* ~1/81 chance of overtaking after it falls 3 blocks behind
* ~1/20,000 chance of overtaking after it falls 8 blocks behind
keep dividing by three for every block it drops behind. 
edit assuming minority fork 25% hashrate
@_date: 2017-03-07 04:14:22


this is what will happen with BU any miner setting wildly different EB runs the risk of your median block attack, and they will loose money. miners aren't fools


51% can hard fork **that's bitcoin** but not in their interest to unless they have clear majority **that's bitcoin**
@_date: 2017-03-07 05:34:12


its a crisis for bitcoin as that is what is happening now. people are paying with visa to get their transactions confirmed


but on average it is 10 mins, and 0 conf would be fine for low value tx's if we had timely entry in a block, and no rbf undermining first seen safe rule


also you are assuming their would be a functioning minority fork to pump, I have heard that 1MB die hards would dump their coins but I think the threat of it is worse than the actuality, they will follow the new consensus and change their reddit usernames.


I can assure you 1/3^4 = 1/81
you probably mean that the minority fork can increase it's hash power because your speculators would drop price of main fork and increase price of minority forcing miners to jump ship. 
How many coins would that take do you think?
@_date: 2017-01-09 19:24:35


Where did that come from, **more deflection maybe**
Your comprehension of my post is limited I said


as that is why you asked the question in the first place. 


"To test my knowledge!", I merely asked you to back up your claim and then gave a counter example for good measure. 
How's your arrogant post doing in that light.
So to unpack all this












**just answer the question**
e. final question
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:29:05


The system is incentive compatible 0-conf for small amounts has a manageable risk profile, 0-conf does not rely on miners being altruistic it merely needs miners not colluding en mass to double spend $2 transactions ie 50%+ not undermining a valuable use case.


and there is anecdotal evidence that 0-conf was working at an acceptable risk level up until network congestion / rbf




who is going to buy a coin that has no pow/pos backing it but has proof of exchange instead. 
you say my maths is wrong, yours makes no sense i cannot follow it. you are just stating numbers please explain where you get


a 75 : 25 split means that the minority chain will produce blocks on average at 1/3 the rate of the majority chain. this cannot be clearer.
the minority chain splits as soon as the majority chain creates a larger block
the majority chain on average creates 3 blocks for every 1 block created on the minority chain.
after only a few hours the majority chain will be unassailable.


and this whole scenario assumes that the 25% miners don't jump ship as they are expending the same electricity cost to mine coins with 1/500'th the value of what they could be making


BU is about choice, and frankly I don't think there would be a viable minority coin.

I understand. it's the same, as the softfork to p2sh uses the anyone can spend.
now we got that out the way,


tell me how a softfork that reduces block size to 0.5mb has the same undo difficulty as a softfork that produces different transactions. 
Answer you were wrong. it is not the same difficulty.

Hi I'm a noob also,


Andreas's talks are great probably my first real source of information was from his youtube presentations, I hope we do get both.
Please don't assume that my comment is against Lightning Networks. 
There are many things in Bitcoin that we can't easily quantify. 
But 500 million users in 1MB blocks, we **can** put figures to, and it may even work!, 1 channel open for greater than a year with a major hub, replenishing directly to the hub in fiat once a month, maybe?
Though I am skeptical.
One of my strong takeaways from Andreas's talks was banking the the third world, being able to send 1$ to someone in Africa with no intermediary. 
There are [2+ Billion Possible Users]( in the world already that could have access at the cost of downloading a mobile wallet.
But I can't see how that could work with only ~~400Million~~ 200Million *onchain* tx's a year segwit + 1MB
Have a read of [this]( it is a strong argument for not being able to increase the blocksize via a hard fork and possibly soft forks as well.
So my question is what is more important now, what should we push for, I come down on the side of on chain scaling (see my earlier post about starting up my first full node)


Have a look around this sub, see how many who make claims without any simple analysis.
Ultimately **You** can decide, put some figures on the claims I and others make, do they make sense?
e. revised 400Million to 200Million + added onchain to 200million tx's a year
@_date: 2017-01-13 19:26:22
Plenty to ponder!
Thanks for the discussion.
@_date: 2017-01-10 01:04:33


I don't doubt it is very draining, with people constantly asking the same questions over and over especialy if it is clear they have some misunderstanding of the way things work, I had my own misunderstandings of SegWit [corrected]( recently. So thanks for your forbearance.
I don't mean to come accross as an out and out SegWit detractor, what concerns me the most is that if it activates it is probably the death blow to alternate implementations or at least a lot more nails in their coffin. 
Which probably cuts off any real chance of hard forking to a larger blocksize which is my current short term preference for scaling. 
I welcome having my mind changed on this point, though I would probably only rehash arguments you have had for years.


Agreed, Once activated, as you said earlier if there were issues they would be fixed, probably without some drastic "undoing" of SegWit
I assume in part it is people reaching for easily identifiable reasons against SegWit, as their scaling preference is a blocksize increase (I understand that Segwit is an effective increase to ~2MB)
Though given 2 choices for the future that can be performed in either order ( I understand the ordering is controversial though I am not convinced )




I prefer the latter, especialy in the light of the **possibility** that the window for change is [closing]( fast.
In the light of this where should we direct our energies? (this is not meant to come accross as ungrateful from an armchair coder who hasn't picked up Stroustrup for many years, and has only just started a full node)
As an aside do you know (please be gentle or/and direct me to relevant work preferably accessible to said armchair coder)
If we transition to Schnorr signatures for transactions in SegWit (if this is even possible) would it be possible to aggregate all the input sigs into one signature? *(edit clarification i mean all input sigs form 1 transaction with many inputs not all sigs from every transaction in block)*
and by extension if we could hard fork to a new transaction type that used Schnorr would we be able to aggregate many input sigs into 1 sig thereby gaining SegWits UTXO benefits.
Thanks for the discussion and your work on Bitcoin.
I have tried to qualify my points by adding extra info in brackets not to be patronizing but to be as clear as i can be, hopefully in time you will be able to take what I have to say at face value.
e2. added clarification *(edit clarification i mean all input sigs form 1 transaction with many inputs not all sigs from every transaction in block)*

I absolutely wasn't calling you a troll, I was merely bringing attention to the double standards of &gt; I don't agree with Peter R. that it is safe to remove a node-enforced blocksize limit -- but of course it is important not to call people trolls just because they have an opinion I disagree with, even if it is very unconvincingly argued for.
I would be interested in your convincing arguments for removing the 21M coin limit. ( I will have a look through your posts ), though I believe most people would accept bigger blocks before that.


Couldn't that be said about the r/bitcoin crowd?, [example]( follow my interaction with u/bitusher's insistence of not being able to verify his own transactions on his limited connection in Costa Rica, if you have the time (no rush) I would be most interested in your critique whichever way it turns out.

I don't believe that's true, What about Gavin and Geof Garzik for example.


Could you elaborate, (I would prefer an answer to this more than any other part of my post)


This is not what I have seen, Initially Gavin and Mike came out with XT in extremis after a long time arguing for a blocksize increase, which was blocked by people who now say they are not against bigger blocks. (XT's exponential growth could have been curtailed with a soft fork *if necessary*).
And I have not seen anything unprofessional from the Classic &amp; BU teams. (perhaps Peter_R's block the stream, but no worse than Greg's Trebuchet to The Moon!)


Core have more eyes on the job, and this can only be a good thing. 
Though I am not convinced by the **code is the spec** argument (bug for bug compatibility or we loose peoples coins, I need to look into/think about this a lot more)


I feel the technical community you mention (Core) has one Vision and that is Greg's Vision, so I would be trusting in one person's vision. This in now way is meant to denigrate Greg's work in anyway. Just pointing out it's **one** mans vision not 100.
I am sure we won't agree on this but it is how I see it. (I know SegWit is Pieter Wullie's), I mean overall vision.


What would cause people to loose money?

You then tried to **deflect** this as you are aware that it would require keeping a log of all previous unspent segwit/p2sh transactions.

I fully don't expect you to, either your unable to or understand that it doesn't support your argument. 
This is just here for you lurkers. have a look at u/wztmjb comments and see that he doesn't really answer difficult questions just tries to deflect, probably wouldn't pass the Turing test.

At what point did I say


What I did try to do was put hard figures on a **prominent experts** claim, 


And if you read his reply, he had just quoted that figure **without really thinking about it**.
The real issue is people (you for example) bandy around numbers without any basis as is shown in your misplaced assumption about my post.


Have you really thought about/tested anything or are you just parroting what experts say (who may or may not have done their due diligence, see above)
**My data point** I just fired up my first node on an old dell e6220 i5 with 16GB ram which cost $240 + 480GB ssd $180 runs at 11watt, it synced whole chain in less than 24hours, it is currently using less than 1Mb average upload on a residential plan. 
Could I handle 10 times the throughput, I don't see why not. My data plan certainly can. (my current dataplan 200Mbit down, 12Mbit up)
In ten years could my NEW **old machine** handle 10 times again, quite probably. 
This of course equates tx's with users, but probably a reasonable assumption.


At what point did I allude to the emphasized end conclusion? 


And yet you took my **straightforward analysis** of 500 million users fitting into 1MB blocks as a nonsensical argument.

At 1MB that's maybe 1 channel opened every 2.5 years, per person. Might come down to 2 years with Schnorr (20% smaller?) **no other activity can fit**
Seems unrealistic to me. 
edit 2hrs later
Just thought who you are u/coblee The Director of engineering at coinbase.
If you can't see that 500 million people won't fit in 1 MB blocks with LN
it doesn't bode well for any of your more complicated technical arguments.
lets say we onboard our 500 million over 10 years, that leaves 0.8MB blocks for other commerce gold2.0?. **each channel has to be open on average for 5 years.** we have problems now with 1MB blocks.

You seem to imply there should be a fixed length of time to verify the whole chain it's currently at ~1day for a modest $200 second hand core i5 laptop from 2012.

So your saying the Bitcoin Blockchain should increase per year by at most ~15GB or 10% in order to keep in line with Technological improvements.
I don't believe transfer is the issue as I have just shown that one can "transmit" 150GB for less than a dollar.
Is the bottle neck signature checking, isn't this very parallelizable and hence far less subject to the slowing of moores law and certainly improving much faster than 10% per year.

100 Watt one would make $0.09 per KWhr.
(100 / (network power usage)) * (block reward per hour) * 10 
s7 has half efficiency of s9, s9 uses 1500w for 14TH, 
edit removed erreoneous factor of 10
edit 2 put it back in

Just re read your post 
I would appreciate your thoughts on one of my earlier questions
What do you think the price/adoption would be today if the blocksize softlimit of 250KB from 2012 was left in place till today
No figures needed Just a higher or lower will do.


Are you aware that the holy grail of Lightning Networks is decentralised routing No Hubs, No Spokes but p2p transactions.
If you take nothing else from our conversation have a deep thought about how **we** get a lot of users onto the Lighting Network.
Best Wishes
A Medium Blocker!

This guy is an idiot!
Nobody is talking about **instant demand** but accumulated growth.
* Q: How did I come up with my idiot assessment?
* A: I have read all his recent posts.

Picture taken clearly in between presentations, how desperate is that.

What about the one that can't be faked and bitcoin is based on?

it doesn't cost $10 a month to run
it would be nearer $0.02 a month to run! 
someone in the west would not even notice the added running cost. and it may be viable in poorer parts of the world for **real decentralisation**
it is perfect for decentralisation of mining if its shortcomings were fixed, ie pool mining.

Spam is hard to define, very easy to contradict oneself
I remember reading a post by you saying you had sent zero fee transactions to test the network. Something I am sure very worthwhile but not in keeping with above def.
also in the same vein. The tx you mentioned earlier as obvious spam. 
It had only a fee attached. Could this not be someone testing the network also. Drop a tx in the network see where / when it gets mined. Build a model all as cheaply as possible.

Sure! 
Because of course you would invest in a coin that used Proof of Twitter.

So no refutation. just your wrong. par for the course eh.
you actually seemed like you were interested in finding what is actually true and verifiable.
I don't assume I am right and welcome discussion correcting the holes in my understanding.
I replied in good faith to a post where you had made a number of assertions but you wont back any of them up?

I get its an effort to make a long post, I had spent a reasonable time on that one. I honestly don't feel it is just "a novel"
* Whats wrong with a hf to 8MB with softlimit of 2MB + 20k SigOps limit. ta

In their alpha build set for release 16 June, the Max Block Weight variable is kept at the same value as BIP141 SegWit: 4,000,000 bytes.
Very interesting thanks for that.
Are you planning to reply to my last post to you (I know its fairly long but hopefully it has some merit &amp; not just knee jerk reactionary)
