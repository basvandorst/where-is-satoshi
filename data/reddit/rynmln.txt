I'd like to see how this was implemented server side. Can you share the source code anywhere? Maybe via PM? I'd love to help out in what ever way I can. Building it as an extension is a nice proof of concept and can be used to get going on the testing/dev. But I want to see it built into the browser ultimately. I also agree that an RFC may be more appropriate. Brilliant work.

Merry Christmas! Glad you guys got some coins!

Care to share the "Note:" for the TX? Also these two addy's balances are reported to be stolen from inputs as well. 15WQxdwk2skFsz2HZs6RfxFBGf3CNRa4S4 and 1ggknc8N4WSasFYF84HRax5hVHDEpsEHr

Yeah, your coins are now located somewhere off the coast of Africa. Sorry man. I'd try to help you find em if my yacht was equipped for it but it is not. 
Also, how are you still posting links to screen shots of the blockchain and not links to the actual blockchain?
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:36:33
The problem with this is that in some cases, the way I understand it, bots provide liquidity and other helpful forces to the market.

Completely useful for the decentralization of the bitcoin network.

He's reselling reddit gold 'creddits.' They come at a discount because you buy a bunch at a time. He's probably paying around 2.49 for each. Therefore he's turning a profit of .50. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 19:57:31
I'm seriously just kidding. I'm looking at the transaction now. Will update when I come up with something.
Edit: looks like whatever address you sent the coins to has spent them via this tx. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:46:08
2FA and GPG...
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:25:35
You are right. Also, your account is very young. Welcome to reddit. Or maybe your not new but just your account is. Either way, welcome.  
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:30:15
Somebody likely tagged the address on blockchain.info and have this URL as a back story/context. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:34:34
Also, the higher the volume, the less the percentage per tx.

What do you make of the mining --&gt; exchanging bit? Is Mt.Gox the one acting as an MSB or are the miners and Mt. Gox both acting as MSBs? 
EDIT: Clarification of initial question.
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:57:55
I actually do work at Starbucks. It's in their nature to test in various markets before launching across the entire company at once. The original post stated they wouldn't be doing that. I've spoken to managers in my market and no one knows anything about it. Also, launching this in the middle of their peak(holiday) season is sort of crazy with everything else happening in the company. Things like this are planned out, trained on and announced in advance within the company. The moment I see something about this in the portal or via an email, I will say something. So far, there is nothing to this. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 19:10:44
Stop sharing your screen with us and copy and paste the link to blockchain itself. Also probably need the address you were supposed to send the btc to to compare to the address you actually sent them to hopefully they match. You need a way to prove the address you sent the btc to is controlled by amagi. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:21:37
They were reported at just-dice... one of the thefts was from the JD account on inputs.io for around 42 BTC.
edit: clarity. JD was not compromised directly. Just inputs.
@_date: 2013-03-19 00:52:09
Some MSB registration [exceptions]( I'm not at all sure of what this means, but I'm interested in [stored value]( specifically.
@_date: 2013-10-24 02:55:41
Inputs.io automatically mixes your coins. That may be your best/only option after purchasing from coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:23:59
Good, returning to normal...

Those pesky hosting fees. Forgot about those.

Seems to be a ddos that would seem to have something to do with having added an alt coin called NovaCoin to the exchange. Word is the coin was destroyed but the damage has been done, lots of drama. Coinotron added it as well for pooled mining and was ddos'd Thursday morning I think.
The lesson to learn here is to be careful with your BTC at all times and don't trade them out of pure speculation, especially for any other alt coins. Liken them to penny stocks, dangerous and volatile and not for you. LTC may or may not be the only exception, but that's for you to decide.
@_date: 2013-02-11 04:26:33
This may not be the most popular answer but I would look into LiteCoin mining if you're looking for the most profitable option. 
With the ASIC wave already upon us it may be more profitable to go the LTC route. There are many different opinions on this, these are just my two cents. LTC can be traded for BTC at  
Also, asking could be helpful as well as seeing the comparisons for BTC mining hardware at   and for a comparison for LTC mining using the scrypt algo --&gt; 
I don't want to discourage you from mining BTC, just want to help broaden your perspective. There are others around who are much more qualified to answer your question.

You keep including links to screenshots. A link to blockchain.info would be the same I think. Specifically the hash string page would be nice. I will say though that I don't think those things are really going to help as much as trying to work this out with amagi. They would have a record of your order if you did in fact submit the order after sending the btc. 
@_date: 2013-02-11 15:44:04
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-08-10 18:22:44
I believe they block apps which store the wallet data on the phone. I'm not positive though.

If you weren't prepared to loose money, you shouldn't have bought.
Plain and simple.

I made this site to help expand the possible uses of Bitcoin. Any thoughts or suggestions are welcome.

Mining. The bitcoin algorithm releases bitcoins with each block. Today it's 25 BTC per block. It used to be 50 BTC per block though. 
Edit: A space.  
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:04:55
You don't have to use verify. But it is helpful sometimes. Anyway, there's no record of it in the blockchain which is ultimate verification when an address is used to tip someone.

Not very bullish on reddit gold if we are just giving it away now, are we? If only I could mine it. Reddit needs a new business model and I think I know just the thing... It's time to pump reddit gold everyone! Hold on to yer britches!
@_date: 2013-02-19 17:25:06
You missed it...

I imagine it wont happen given the ratio of up/down votes it has gotten.

It will neither be proven, nor disproven. I imagine if you ask him he will probably deny it.
Also, what if OP is Reiter claiming to be Satoshi?

Nothing to see here FinCen...
@_date: 2013-02-11 04:36:35
This may not be helpful but I've stopped predicting anything beyond what is below. Mind you, I am slightly bullish with a healthy hint of bear. 
Short term you can expect corrections both large and small. 
Long term, it's anyone's guess. So long as no one finds some kind of flaw in BTC my guess is it will continue the trend upward after a few scary corrections.
The current trend seems overbought to me, but that's just me. 
EDIT: grammar
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:43:27
Probably not.
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:16:23
That's what the other two reported thefts stated as well.
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:33:51
Thanks, seems as though we are the minority. I thought it might come off as fan-boyish or something, but was worth a shot any way. Might make for a fun april fools day joke or something.
@_date: 2013-10-26 20:23:16
I tried the checkout process myself and you have to submit the order after you send the coins. Did you submit the order? Did you save the confirmation or print it after hitting submit? These are all things that would be useful when discussing this with amagi.
Edit: also, since it looks like amagi uses bitpay for their invoices I would contact bitpay with the date/time, Tx hash and address to which the coins were sent. They should be able to help more than amagi actually since they can pull up old invoices in their system. Tl/dr: contact bitpay.

Welcome. A couple tips if I may. Please don't store your new found wealth in a web wallet unless you're willing to loose it. Also, encrypt and backup the wallet you do use with a high bit entropy passphrase. I recommend armory but other desktop clients will work. I'd hate to see it lost at the hands of a hack out of a lack of effort put in to protect your coins. Again welcome and enjoy!
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:43:12
And yes, you got it right, the merchants are what matter. BUT, it's hard to convince myself to spend when I feel like if I waited I could spend less of my BTC on the same item later.

You'll still be doing better than the GPU crew when you take electricity into account.

I'm going to have to disagree with the way you think CampBX looks. I think it's clean and easy to understand. It also looks better than Gox to me. Looks are relative and have nothing to do with security.

Well, it'll be there when you need it. My phone is alerted as soon as a purchase is made, so it won't go unnoticed no matter if its a year from now. Unless soundcloud offers to accept btc, then I'm out haha.
