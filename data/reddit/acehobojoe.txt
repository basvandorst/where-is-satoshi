Lol, I didn't see the article til now! did you edit?
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:07:32
create a fake seed with like .01 BTC in it and let the thief find it. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:40:01
But isn't the LN something that is more "automatic" in litecoin? While I think in bitcoin we were going to try to do the savings/checkings analogy to have basically two wallets for most heavy users. Or is it something that can just be enabled for every transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:31:39
YESS I"m so excited. I think we all are. 
It would suck if it just crashed the network.. haha. I think that's why they're not rushing it, which is good.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:14:19
I like coinbase but.. . I feel like they have gone dark 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:16:51
I know this goes against the point of bitcoin, but couldn't there theoretically be a crypto bank for this purpose? or crypto insurance?
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:32:47
Such a sad story, but a lesson for us all! Make the most of what you have, not what you could have had.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:17:12
You've got to be kidding me. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:19:46
You should go to somewhere exciting and unconventional, like the rainforest of South America or Patagonia or something. I would avoid tourist traps. 
I think as soon as the fees decrease and it becomes instant, I'll start telling vendors why they should accept bitcoin :D

You make a great point with so few words.. honestly it is so genius when you think about PoW and what it means for the network. Care to elaborate for any government loving environmentalists on why it won't destroy the whole world?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:32:39
got it.. electrum is the bomb.com
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:09:21
He did it. He posted a video 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:07:21
but will you eat your right nut?
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:18:07
The latest one was so idiotic
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:46:02
So you're saying, spend Bcash on bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:37:56
What video? I don't think I saw it
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:28:23
B-Cash, B-cash, B-cash, 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:33:26
not at all
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:02:04
*the freaking frogs gay
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:50:34
Venezuelans will have better luck with BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:28:10
I understood that reference
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:32:52
where you at in SC? many people here getting in it. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:09:14
So, an amount below 10k basically should be fine, but once I start moving 20k in and out of bank account regularly, regulators will want to kick my ass
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:46:12
yep. It seems like this line of work is surrounded in scrutiny. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:36:53
Hahaha, fellow investor friend. I would never ask you to reveal how much bitcoin you own.. . . . 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:23:02
My opinion is ... daytrade if you have TONZ of money and you're ok making a tiny miniscule percentage. 
Trying to make a meaningful percentage is insane. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:38:30
I'm sure you are one of them. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:01:33
The female host did not buy bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:34:40
To be fair, there are only like 10 women in crypto, we need more! 
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:28:25
Continue to work and take a job doing something awesome for shit pay. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:30:18
but hey, buy bitcoin. AMIRIGHT
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:30:43
This is getting bad in the cryptospace. hopefully google can learn to exercise better judgement about phishing
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:26:05
Yea, they might as well be r/BCH
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:11:08
Totally agree, but what is our best shot at taking these bitches down? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:42:44
Get the ticker for Mac or windows
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:56:41
I mean hey, us traders can profit off of their stupidity. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:27:16
BE PATIENT. Take your time and just manage it properly. Like many have said, find a really really smart crypto lawyer if possible. I have some friends in this field specifically that can help because they understand it like you and I. 
You can put a lot of it in less risky investments, but I would for sure leave a good 10 to 20 in BTC. It would be wonderful if you left it all in, but you have to live. 
Invest it wisely and pay the least amount of taxes possible. even a measly 3% of growth per year is 100,000$ per year. That should be easy to live on? You can put it in mutual funds + gold and what have you. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:44:44
They talk a lot, but have no actual knowledge on crypto. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:20:32
I think it all depends on what you consider easy. We have made massive technological advancements that have made the world much better off, but some people might say it is harder. I think life is always hard and it's about what you do with what you're given :) 
@_date: 2017-09-04 00:19:49
I think we all can agree that fees everywhere across the bitcoin network need to go down. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 00:59:32
What is a good timeframe for trading? make a trade and leave it for a few hours? or concentrate all at one time?
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:28:43
would love to buy some
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:50:50
very interesting points. Thank you all. :)
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:53:58
Was thinking about California, but i have a few friends open to it in other states
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:15:06
I will mostly be doing direct bank deposits to a bank or credit union. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:52:12
you mean, don't put a time frame on getting back your initial investment?
