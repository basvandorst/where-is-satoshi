I HODL BTC and want to help. Can you help me understand if this is something I can from my home internet w/ TimeWarner cable without borking my usual bandwidth allotment?

Wall St is a threat to BTC. Rehypothecation. Don’t cheer for ETFs. Just buy your damn coins n keep damn your keys.

They’re telling you they don’t want your business. Cash app FTW.

Govt wants you spending to prop up their fiat wealth instead of saving your own real wealth. They want us to be good little serfs and spend more than we make on their tax farms.

If you’re in the US you’ll report ordinary income on the difference between what you paid for btc and what you sold or converted to USD.

Those paper wallets are generally unsafe. Prob ok for small amounts like this but if you used a recent copy of paper bitcoins.con you should know that it was sold and now is a scam site. Double chk the pub keys to see if the sats are still there so you guys won’t be disappointed.
