I think you replied to the wrong guy.  I have no idea what I am doing.

Hello so, I don't really udnerstand.  If I have btc in blockchain.info, do I now ALSO have bcc?
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:27:11
nah brah.  Nah.  Because the bitcoin you are buying is more expensive.
Look.  You go to a dealer, and you buy an 1/8 for $45.  You put it in your glove compartment and you forget it.  Then the dealer gets busted.  Now an 1/8 costs $60 because it is risky out there. 
Are you gonna go to the new dealer, sell your weed to him, and then buy it back?  Is he going to give you free weed just because you bought it a week ago?  Nah brah.  Nah.  He's not going to do that.  There's no magic weed loop based on the price, bro.
In conclusion: Your weed is your weed. Your bitcoin is your bitcoin. It is just more expensive now.
Disclaimer: Don't smoke your bitcoin.

If I import the bcc to there, do I lose my btc?  Or do I just get free bcc?

Can you explain this?  I heard Pollinex is getting shifty (not answering support tickets).  Are you saying this because bitcoin is gonna go up and alts will be less attractive?  Therefore it's bad to be holding them?  Just curious.  I couldn't make full sense of what you wrote.

No that was someone else who invested his and his sister's inheritance and panic sold during a dip.  He lost about 60% of the inheritance doing this.  That's when he came to reddit for advice and was told he was a complete moron.

You have lost money though.  Because at this moment you have the opportunity to take it out.  
I don't really understand the "playing with the house's money" arguments.  It's your money, you're just rationalizing.
That said I am in on bitcoin.  Bought pretty early so willing to ride. Let's see what happens.

B-buy the d-dip?
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:34:27
Just hold it.  There's no point locking in losses unless you think it will never hit 2200 again.  If you think that, then sell.
If you think it will hit 2200 again, then hold, and when it goes over where you bought it, then you can sell.

Well it seems that the price went up quite rapidly, and then the price went down quite rapidly. Then it kind of went up again.

why?  Honest question and not being snarky.

During the dot com bubble (at least at the end) you heard about dot coms a lot.  Pets.com for example had a super bowl ad.  That was the signal of death and became a symbol.  It became very well known and very hyped on the news.
The problem was that they conflated views with value.  So a site with views, even if it had no revenue, gained massively in value.  
Remains to be seen what is in common here.  I think the alt coins are definitely wild west right now, not sure about btc.  Might go a bunch higher then come down, might come down sooner.  Can't really tell till after.  That's the nature of it.

At 1T market cap whats the price per btc?

Bitcoin can function as a store of value whereas Ripple isn't designed to do this.  Ripple is just an instrument of liquidity.
It's really interesting technology but I can't really understand how it is a long term investment.
My guess is that the eventual ecosystem will indeed have a technology like Ripple in it, and maybe like Bitcoin too, but they have different purposes.

Why should there be a logical explanation?  I know it is natural to look for it, but you are dealing with a crowd.  Crowds are not rational.
Speculation is fueled by greed and fear.  Both emotions can lead to irrational behavior.  Therefore searching for a reason will likely leave you empty handed.
The crowd is made up of a bunch of people with partial information all searching for reasons exactly like you, and all trying to guess the behavior of the others.

SegWit is locked in which means that BIP148 pass and then we will disable ASIC Boost 
It was a good effort.
