Reminds me of...

Did you get a copy of the dump? I'd like to have a copy in orderto scrape the images before the server goes offline... Thanks.

This person needs help.
@_date: 2014-01-07 07:50:41
Yeah but the 10% discount is a short term promotion to draw up new business and generate goodwill with the bitcoin community. Since we're talking about it, I'd say it's working very, very well, wouldn't you?
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:20:09
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:57:02
Yep. Just saw this. The question is... is this a rogue dev messing with the market or a legit sign of things to come?
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:27:38
If they've copied your code/design then you can take legal action. That's copyright infringement. If their servers are hosted in USA you might even be able to do a DMCA takedown via their host. Not sure if the same exists in Canada to be honest.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:50:40
huh? The price has only been recovering since the source comment was posted.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:23:43
Source for this?
@_date: 2014-03-16 18:51:31
But 1 year is like 10 years in bitcoin terms. Apples to oranges really.
@_date: 2014-01-01 09:11:42


How is it different from the Bitcoin Embassy in Montreal?
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:10:39
Please expand? Thanks.
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:15:44
Why does that make you feel bullish?
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:29:45
Not working for me either. Seems to be an SSL problem.
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:11:31
I liked the old days of cut-out letters myself. Had a real crafty feel to it.
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:09:52


Right, registering with and complying with the myriad of laws from 48 different states is completely reasonable. Now you sound drunk.
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:29:08
Appropriate username ;-)
@_date: 2014-03-09 00:51:41
This is great. Perhaps a standalone post with this proposal is in order? Maybe leave Gavin's name and "sleezeball" board out of it to keep it more constructive?
@_date: 2014-03-26 06:57:01
I"m confused. Did you have a record or not?
And yes I know exactly what you mean at the USA land border crossings. To be fair though the Canadian side can be just as difficult.

It's my understanding that to prevent infinite loops the execution time of the script will be tied to its transaction fee. Can't tell you the details though but if you're curious you could look it up.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:02:53
Ok, "seriously stupid" then?

He could probably afford his own railroad. So, there's that.

I meant flash crash the BTC price.

Cheque is the Canadian/British spelling. Some might even say it's the "correct" spelling :-)

You're giving Mark waaay too much credit. His competence as a programmer and business leader have long been known to this community to be questionable. Some theories also suggest he is vastly over-confident so as to not recognize his limits and solicit help/guidance when he really needs it.
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:46:11
Really great and simple explanation. Thank you for this.
@_date: 2014-03-08 17:31:00
Yes, the irony is amazing. But imagine if there was a way to turn it into a nearly indestructible solid substance. 
Bonus points if the substance glitters.
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:38:32
Yeah that was weird. I think it was just an awkward segue to plugging his favorite game.

You mean ribbon. Trophies are expensive.

Obvious troll is obvious.

You sir, just won the internet.
@_date: 2014-03-26 06:43:55


The irony of this comment is...uhhh.... well, I'm at a loss for words. It appears you are the victim of someone using FUD yourself.
Either that or this is a joke. In which case, kudos!

Not spam bots. I have the same problem. What a bizarre conclusion.
@_date: 2014-05-07 15:12:40
Or..... move?
@_date: 2014-02-22 08:33:53
Settle down, jeez.

I'm still getting the same error myself. 19 hours later. Any ideas?
Here's a screen capture: 
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:39:39
Well congratulations on not giving a fuck. It's your right I guess.
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:15:31
Nobody argued against the moral obligation to adhere to regulation. For some strange reason you brought it up. They just said adhering to the regulation was not viable for their business. So they stopped.
Net result: innovation stifled.
From elsewhere in this thread:


No other notable free market economy has such obstacles. 48 states x 5 million is 240 million dollars. Not "reasonable" by any stretch of the imagination.

Can you post it somewhere please?
@_date: 2014-03-09 00:45:31
Legal fiduciary duty? Probably none. *Moral responsibility* is another thing altogether.
Note: I'm making moral judgements, as I don't have all the facts... I'm just pointing out where the real concern lies.
@_date: 2014-01-01 09:31:16
Huh? You lost me.

Smart whales will bet against this and cause a flash crash on the day in question so they can collect. Just sayin'.

That's a very good question that I haven't seen addressed yet. How do these new rules affect the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong? Anyone?

It was Max.
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:54:59
Thanks. Do you think that number is updated programatically though? Does it actually change daily?
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:07:08
You can buy fractions of bitcoins though. I started with $50 at the end of August when it was $118.

In case it hasn't been pointed out. The Canadian Exchange CAVirtex has debit cards that you can withdraw cash with at ANY ATM or use at almost ANY merchant in the country to pay for goods. They are available now.
With something like this in hand it makes sense to have ALL your money in BTC and only convert to dollars (via the debit card) when you need to pay for something and can't use BTC.
Best of both worlds!
@_date: 2013-12-27 17:18:41
I read that as "p2p distributed Silk Road", also a good idea.
