["The basic fallacy of this view is its failure to recognize that any amount of money is sufficient to make all the necessary exchanges in society. A greater stock of money simply means that all exchanges will be made with a structure of prices for consumer goods and factors of production at a higher level. If the money stock is smaller, the same set of exchanges will be made with a price structure at a lower level. Profits persist in either case."](

Nice. A written down brain wallet is just nonsense to someone who doesn't know what it is. Nice.
@_date: 2013-03-01 19:46:13
OK. **This is blowing my mind.**
You can just print out a sheet of linked public/private keys via bitaddress.org , then send BTC to them, and give them to people?!? Holy... 
What happens if you try and send money to a private key QR code?
I downloaded TOR, just out of curiosity, but I don't know how to get on the "forbidden site."
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:11:11
Ah. I don't have enough addresses to have gotten to the point where I messed with this. I have a spinner, a coinbase, and a blockchain account. You just keep the same wallet and add as many keys as you need? Can you consolidate wallets?
So it is IMPERATIVE that you keep your wallet forever with ALL the addresses you have ever used. Correct?
@_date: 2013-03-23 13:48:21
This is for a transfer, not a purchase.
@_date: 2013-10-08 14:58:26
Don't they operate in the same fashion?
@_date: 2013-03-22 19:52:16
It's not fiat money. It's a digital commodity. Fiat money is backed by nothing but words. Law. Force. Legal tender laws. Bitcoin is market driven, and voluntary.

Explain the address QR code to me. If I make that public, then people can send me BTCs with it?
@_date: 2013-10-08 14:59:43
In this particular case, it's two single wallets generated at bitaddress.org
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:14:09
Thank you. So Armory is an offline generator?
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:03:19
@_date: 2013-03-15 18:58:17
Well, I was trying to put my spinner key into my Coinbase, but I could't figure out how. It just kept creating new keys. Is Coinbase a good place to keep your keys? I was worried about my phone crashing, 'cause it's old.
@_date: 2013-03-15 19:18:38
Thank you.

@_date: 2013-04-03 21:02:02
I have a question. So if I move everything to a paper wallet, that paper wallet had to be generated on a computer. What's to say bitaddress.org, or some other service isn't storing that generated private/public key somewhere?
@_date: 2013-02-28 00:02:56
But when you say key**s**, how many are there? Why are their multiple keys? 
@_date: 2013-02-28 00:23:01
How do you consolidate? You just send the balance of one address to another?

@_date: 2013-02-28 14:30:54
Like yesterday, I saw someone tipped a waiter with .2 Bitcoins. So, he left a piece of paper with a QR code on it. I thought that code was a private key to a wallet with .2 Bitcoins in it. Is that how it would be done in the corporeal world?
@_date: 2013-03-01 21:09:06
In the situation where someone is transferring a paper wallet to someone else, how do you verify the amount? And, how do you prevent the giver from having a copy of the private key? I guess best practice is to transfer immediately to another account.
@_date: 2013-08-31 14:49:57
Sounds awesome. I can't wait to live in a citadel with a Hans-Hermann Hoppe robot buddy.
@_date: 2013-02-28 14:27:19
So if I wanted to create a second temporary wallet to give to someone, Spinner would not be the tool to use, correct?
I have .02 BTC BTW. High rollin'.
@_date: 2013-02-27 22:43:01
Oh, so you put a set amount in an online wallet, then you "give" the wallet on a piece of paper via QR code!?
So an unscrupulous person could scan the code and take the money?
Can you transfer money without a fee? How do you transfer?
@_date: 2013-03-15 17:41:55
I have my Spinner private key. It is associated with a public key that has been "published." 
Can I "put" that private key into other management software, like another instance of Spinner, or my Coinbase account?
@_date: 2013-02-28 03:40:32
So that key that Bitcoin Spinner created has nothing to do with my phone, right? So what if I wanted to look up my balance and history on that key with my computer instead? I would put my public key into where?
@_date: 2013-03-22 20:22:56
You can't counterfeit math! :-)
@_date: 2013-10-08 14:46:26
That's what I thought. I keep a very small about in Mycelium , but I have most of my BTC in two paper addresses in a safe. I wanted to know what to do in a panic situation. Like in a home invasion/raid type situation. If time is of the essence.
@_date: 2013-10-08 15:20:31
Which do suppose is the best for offline key generation and physical storage (like in a safe)?
@_date: 2013-02-27 23:51:15
So your backup is just the alphanumeric string that is your private key?
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:41:49
How does this work in the future? Will there be countless valid yet dead end key pairs floating around? FOr instance, I put my address on images I do. ( Would that be considered a semi-permanent address, whereas a one-off transaction pair would be discarded (though it would remain viable)?
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:32:03
What's your BTC/$ cutoff before you make a new wallet? (I should have more than one, right?)
@_date: 2013-10-08 15:34:15
I am well prepared for an illegal home invasion. I am more concerned with a "legal" home invasion. ...a confiscation attempt. 
@_date: 2013-10-08 15:55:53
I have an envelope that says Bitcoin Address - Do not throw away!
(I'm doing it wrong.)
@_date: 2013-03-01 20:23:49
How do I assure or at least verify that a generated address is unique to me, and not just a way to funnel BTC to a stranger? 
@_date: 2013-03-06 16:21:21
I finally got my Coinbase linked to a bank account, but it won't allow me to buy any BTC. Is that because there are none for sale?
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:57:45
@_date: 2013-02-27 22:26:41
So earlier today I saw a post where someone tipped a waiter with BTS, and left a piece of paper with a QR code on it. How does that work?
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:42:02
What I mean is, let's say I am doing hundreds of thousands of temporary transactions with unique addresses. So I have to keep track of which keys I keep and which ones I discard after I dump them. But if someone sends me something on a dumped temp address, or I mix up one of my primary addresses... It just seems like an overhead nightmare.
I guess I don't fully "get" how one is supposed to manage all the temp addresses.
@_date: 2013-02-27 22:27:15
If I place my public QR code on an image, people can send me BTC? 
Edit: I am havig a discussion with Jeff Tucker, and we were wondering if we should post the code on FB.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:55:19
75 Bitcoins. I wish.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:52:40
Resistance is futile.
@_date: 2013-02-28 00:42:44
I was just wondering when managing keys would become troublesome. I guess when the money is gone, it goes away?
