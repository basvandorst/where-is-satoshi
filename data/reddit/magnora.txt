Yeah, not until you get a crash like 2000 or 2008 or 1987... 
edit: Don't downvote me, I'm fucking right, and you guys know it. Few people saw 2008 coming and if you had a diversified portfolio during that time you would've been _killed_. That is gambling. It's all gambling. The only difference is that in a casino the house usually wins, and in the stock market that's hopefully not the case. That doesn't mean it's not gambling. No one knows the future.

I had the same thing happen. Hooray for coinbase.

Yeah I was down 3k, then I got it all back, then I was up 2k and then I just lost and lost until I was down 18k and quit. House takes 2.7%

Yup exactly. I viewed it as 2 hours of good entertainment for $2. Hard to complain about that.

Or factual. Or related to reality or real people's lives

yeah that works until your bet has to be bigger than how much you have

But the dollar could inflate beyond 3.7% a year, and then suddenly you're losing money and it's locked in to a CD that you have to pay fees to get out of. My point is that there is risk involved with every investment and in that sense it _is_ gambling.

I have a feeling things are going to get very very strange over the next few weeks.

Is this really what showed on the website if you went to it while it was hacked? At the end it says the FBI seized bitcoin because it's illegal? Is any of this real? What is going on here?

I spent all night losing 18,000 dogecoins on a roulette table

Investing is gambling, period. It's just that some gambles have acceptable risk.

That's where I get them too. They withdraw straight out of my online bank account now after I did a verification process. The fee is 1% of the total amount changed from USD to BTC, plus a 15 cent bank fee. Takes a week for the coins to arrive, but you get them at the price they were when you clicked 'buy'.

If that were true then everyone would be index stocks and that'd be the end of it. But that doesn't work because the market crashes with regularity. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:22:19
Yes, because CD rates are so low that you might as well just sit on your cash to have the extra liquidity. Everything has an opportunity cost. Plus the USD isn't going to be around forever. Nothing is rock solid. There are just varying amounts of risk

Maybe they want bitcoins so they can have a try at manipulating the bitcoin market
