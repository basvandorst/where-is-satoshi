That was very interesting to watch, thanks.
I don't really see a 100% direct comparison though...for example Henry Ford produced a product and sold it at market value. I think the comparison would be if Ford had produced 100,000 vehicles, released 1000 into the wild to drive up interest and frenzy, while holding back the other 99,000 until demand drove the prices higher and higher.

op isn't a homosexual or a cigarette and using/perpetuating negative language like that shows your intelligence really well.

If that was the case why wouldn't they just price their items in bitcoin? The fact is they price them in USD, so that is what they are accepting.

I call it 'greed' because that is exactly what it is...desire to possess wealth, goods, or objects of abstract value with the intention to keep it for one's self, far beyond the dictates of basic survival and comfort. I'm saying that over 90% of bitcoin daytraders operate in order to increase their own holdings, while doing nothing to increase the viability/success of the currency itself. They don't give a fuck if bitcoin succeeds or not, only if they make a quick buck.

Anyone who day trades is doing it for money...they are doing it for greed.
Yes I used an explicitive modifier, but that was to get a point across.
And I'd like to remind you that YOU were the one who replied "stop being so fucking ignorant" instead of contributing to the conversation in any positive way...go drink some bleach

That does not disprove anything that I've said.
