300000000x13000 = 3900000000000.  that is still a number greater than the total federal budget of 2017.  and you've failed to pay for defense, infrastructure, education, and only have 900 billion to pay for the medical care of 300000000 people.
so no you cannot pay for this by being rid of welfare programs.  not only that the people that were on welfare, or disability are just fucked, or still require further social welfare programs.


no it doesnt, they have less reason to pay you a minimum wage, you get $1000 a month, and they already help pay for that out of the taxes they pay.  plus that $1000 a month isnt enough for you to live the way you want on.  so ill find someone who will take the $2/hr im offering and you can go live on on your free $1000, why the fuck would i let you hurt my bottom line even further.


no, you've increased it to a number greater than the total budget of the US at this moment, and you still havent provided for the needs of the disabled, or those that actually needed a safety net and would have been back on their feet if the fucking moochers hadnt taken all the safety net money and distributed it amongst themselves so they could live the NEET lifestyle.
also 13k/yr is below the poverty line... those are the people that still get medicaid and food stamps and shit like that that consumes a large portion of social welfare benefits.

meaningless hypothetical.  I encounter people everyday who work harder at getting handouts than i work at working because they dont want to be productive. 


no matter how smart you think you sound when spouting this shit it is dumb, no need to try to sound stupider than you already are.


perhaps that is true of you or I, but that does not make it true of everyone.


there is no reason to work if they are already given enough free to survive, they can just spend more time begging for more free shit... its like you lived in a cave your whole fucking life and never met a moocher, that or you are a moocher... 


like there wont be ubi fruad?  so those people that dont want to work and get welfare, you just want to give them free money forever... not only do i have to pay that free dollar to them, but it devalues the dollars I earn.


if UBI is in place, minimum wage will be gone, and there wont be enough money to pay for everything, food, shelter, clothing, healthcare, etc, as a result supplemental income will be required (or higher taxes to pay for unfilled needs) but there will be no need for minimum wage as UBI is supposed to provide a living income to all, as a result minimum wage goes bye bye... ( i guarantee it, because if i was the fucking waltons this is what i would be lobbying for)  now people have to work 16hr days to make what they were making before on welfare with UBI and a job....
and the people that have good jobs that produce shit, professionals, craftsmen, people with skills, are paying extra taxes for the breadlines the slaves go stand in at the end of the day because they still arent paid enough even with their supplemental work income and the UBI which is supposed to provide for them... and this makes everyone who isnt fucking wealthy living off the work of the slaves a fucking slave to the tax man all the while the fucking wealthy reap in ever greater profits safely somewhere on an island or overseas where all the UBI poor fucks can never get them.


yeah, you aren't rich, but youre closer to the rothschilds than you are to commissar jamal and comrade kletus as far as those two are concerned.  And as far as people with money are concerned you are just a useful idiot.
edit: back in my college days i did debt collection, made a lot of calls to rural mississippi, louisana, alabama, the florida panhandle, on subprime loans... you are fucking rich dude.  oh and i lived in cali, now i live in that rural south where i did debt collection, and i can say with absolutely certainty ive met more than one of the people i called to collect on... you are pretty fucking rich dude, not to me... but to more people than you think.

Why the fuck are you morons so eager to become slaves.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:43:09
now go back and read above why UBI cannot replace those systems.  WHERE THE FUCK IS $4.3 TRILLION GOING TO COME FROM??? THE MONEY TREE?
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:57:33
And you are just twisting truth to fit you definition.
You are db as fuck if you think free money to everyone.
Where the fuck 4.3 trillion dollar per year going to come from you dumb fucking moron?
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:38:39
okay mister mister appeal to authority guy.
my name is Bernie Madoff, iff you give me $1,000,000 in 10 years i will give you $2,000,000.  trust me I am a financial expert and i run a successful hedge fund. 
edit: someone smart would have realized that I was insulting them by insinuating they were naive, not that i was actually making a serious argument.

All of this is not something I am going to read...  it is meaningless ramblings.  In the common usage communism is a system of government that relies on the redistribution of wealth... if you want to be more accurate it resembles full on socialsm, which is just a derivative of clasical communism, which is more commonly known as marxism.
UBI is communism just like the American republic is a fucking democracy.  define shit however you like a rose is still a rose.

WHERE THE FUCK DOES $1200 FREE DOLLARS FOR EVERYONE COME, THE FUCKING MONEY TREE?????
GOD YOU ARE FUCKING STUPID.

Okay.... look, im a nigerian prince, i have $100,000,000 earmarked for distribution, but this monies cant be moved from banks wothou...
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:45:19
I really dont care what you think of your position in the socioeconomic ladder.  It isnt going to change my opinion of you.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:45:18
Doesnt take research to arrive at this conclusion.  You think, from the perspective of poverty, that free money will make you free.  Well i am here to tell you that is no such thing as a free fucking lunch.  If someone is giving you free lunch it is because they stand to gain fromm it in the long run.  
I am sorry that you dont have 2nd order level of reasoning... 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:28:26
Ubi is a scam to create dependence.  Dependence leads to slavery.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:00:23
I didnt say you dont have to think.  I said you dont have to research.
When the nigerian prince sends you emails do you need to research their veracity or do you know a scam when you see it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:38:38
wait, wait, wait... so first is it $1200/yr, or $1200/month?
b/c $1200 per year isnt going to pay for the cost of those programs for the people that depend on it, fuck it wont even pay for half a year of medicaid.
if it is $1200/month that is 360billion dollars/month or 4.3trillion/yr that is 700 billion more than the entire 2017 federal budget.
and even if this is a limited program that say only benefits the bottom 25% then what about the rest, where is their free money.   people will be stuck on UBI...
it is just fucking communism you dumb piece of shit.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:33:25
Yeah, it is, you can literally go out on the street and ask anyone that isnt a communist.

stock trading, and even currency trading on markets are governed by a different set of laws than a currency exchange.
@_date: 2014-09-09 15:40:47
Not saying I wouldn't trust them, but an advantage of a currency like bitcoin is that it can be easily traded and sent from comfort of your own home.  This specific situation you bring up isn't about trust it's more about sloth... or time, or lack thereof, as well.
@_date: 2014-09-09 15:42:34
These laws don't require photo id's and pictures or video of you holding up said id, and pictures of utility bills.
Furthermore laws are only applicable if you are trading in a currency market and not simply purchasing a currency, like you would at the airport when you go to another cuontry.
@_date: 2014-09-09 15:59:48
does amazon ask you for your id? does travelocity? any poker sites? or any other online retailer?  No.  If amazon asked me for a picture of my ID and a picture of me holding said ID i would never in my life do business with or through them.
@_date: 2014-09-09 18:06:51
They do not ask for a picture id.  Wtf world do you live in?
@_date: 2014-09-09 15:36:47
In any transaction trust is required, even if you give me bitcoin for a product you have to trust that I will give you that product.  And yes it is what is wrong, you are asking me to trust you with my personal information, and my money, while you verify if you can trust me.
@_date: 2015-05-19 17:34:29
Same index as LIBOR.... so now wsll street is going to be manipulating bitcoin prices as well?
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:29:10
Cause and effect dont exist.
But there are a lot of ifs in that statement.  The middle if though is the weak point.  Points 1 and 3 stand on their own merit.
@_date: 2015-04-27 04:11:28
whats this?
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:15:27


I don't think there is a secret conspiracy.
I am just saying that it is something that does not seem out of the realm of possibility to me (but that is because i don't understand bitcoin at the level of code); using pooled processing power is used to solve problems, and is far cheaper than running a super computer, is it not?
I understand how hashing works in the most basic of terms.  I also understand that hashes are used to encrypt things other than currencies, this is correct no? 


Would there not be problems with the fiat currencies used today if supply constantly diminished?  What would exempt bitcoin from similar issues?
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:57:36


This desired output is arbitrary and of no use whatsoever except for winning the game that they are all playing (for the next block reward).
Does the existence of a massively large number of solutions offer the possibility of finding a pattern in the hash and perhaps a backdoor; and thus negate it's security?  Could a solution if found be applied to similar hashes?


Yes, but that is not how currency works, a shortage of currency can wreak havoc on financial markets, and even the currency itself.


This does certainly solve the problem of expanding the currency pool, and is actually one of the things I see as an advantage to bitcoin;  I do see as a problem in how further divisions are dictated, which requires a community consensus; or rather a consensus based on the number clients; this allows for the possiblity to manipulate markets.
Then there the distribution of wealth; bitcoin preferentially distibutes wealth to those who have known about it for the longest; meaning there are people who control significant percentages of bitcoin; it is not realistically linked to anything such as gdp, or production... here in lies the largest problem I can see.  Lets say that run a construction company, and It takes me three months to build a house and I get 500 bitcoin for it; well i the same time some dude with ASIC system can collect 500 bitcoin and all he did is run a fucking computer that cost $1,200 for three months, what about the guy who got in early and ran calculations on a bunch of his old unused gpu's and made thousands bitcoin, while the person who designed and built those video cards made salary...  there is a lack of parity.
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:25:07
I agree with your assessment but I still feel as though the existence of long term indicators is no guarantee in the long term viability of bitcoin.
Bitcoin development projects certainly are good for bitcoin; but what about bitcoin imitators, what effect will they have on the market?  What about the fact that only a certain subset of the population has the ability to create bitcoins, and an even smaller subset can create them at a reasonable pace?  What about the fact that there is a cap?  What about the the cost of maintaining cryptocurrencies after the tap is dried (this I see as the major flaw in the system, although it may not become apparent to many for decades, if bitcoin lasts decades)?
What about dead wallets and dead coins?
More importantly my question is: could there possibly be an ulterior motive? I am not horribly well acquainted with the cryptography, but it seems to me the creation of a currency in which hundreds of thousands of people are constantly solving problems with better and better hardware, might be a far cheaper, not to mention more efficient solution, to a larger problem, perhaps for some intelligence agency...  I mean no one knows who created bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:25:47
You make a very good argument here.


I don't think you can say it's out right false, anytime there is a change in currency from one form or another there is the destruction of wealth; or reapportionment.  You could say that I am overstating the possibilities; but even then these are concerns that people will have.
Look, I am just playing the devils advocate here.  Partly because I am trying decide if it is worthwhile to invest money in hardware to mine bitcoins, certainly had i been around at the beginning and cpu and gpu mining was still able to produce a reasonable amount of btc then certainly it would be a no brainer based on the investment/possible payout ratio; but it's a much different game, and the invest/payout ratio has certainly decreased, and will decrease very quickly with ASIC era on us.
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:35:05
can't ignore that fact; David won that battle, and if there is the possibility of multiple Davids, then his chances are even better.
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:28:09
This most certainly is true; and certainly the cost of obtaining gold has increased as reserves have decreased; and similarly the cost of equipment in order to mine increased as newer technologies were created.
And clearly could be made about fiat currencies; as those that control the production certainly maintain control over the value, and have the power to make themselves wealthy.
But lets talk realistically about a switchover; lets take the change of gold to paper currency; there was a parity when this switchover occurred, those with gold were allowed (rather forced) to exchange it for paper currencies; and the current stratum of wealth was maintained more or less.  Bit coin has nothing to maintain the current stratum of wealth; certainly people can exchange their currency for bitcoin (which is why they have value now) but what happens when the value of bitcoins is such that the holders of bitcoin are no longer willing to trade coins for cash; this leaves a large portion of the population that has just had their wealth destroyed.  This being the case it is likely that a large number of people, particularly vendors that are unlikely to accept bitcoin in addition to market volatility, it also precludes a large portion of the population from participating in bitcoin, as bitcoin has the possibility to destroy the wealth they currently have.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:59:58
i think that goes without saying; but given enough information, or computing power is it not possible that what once was infeasible becomes feasible?
