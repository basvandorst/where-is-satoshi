anyone dealing with crypto will need an account with an exchange.  it doesn't matter one bit which one they deal with
anyone moving money out of the game a dozen times a week is an idiot and deserves the discomfort for being stupid
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:43:36
it's the fault of both parties, therefore it's the fault of neither.  since they're both able to fix the problem but won't, there's absolutely no point in blaming anyone
the only thing you can do is like i said, third party intervention

... people speaking about barack obama on TV aren't "spokespeople for barack obama" he has specific press people that convey his messages to the world.  in the same fashion someone who claims they don't know anything about bitcoin is not a spokesperson FOR bitcoin
is english your second language or something? i don't understand why this would confuse you...

unless you're a major corporation, why should we care that you took whatever ambiguous amount of money out of one place and put it in another?
what do you want with this post? a ticker-tape parade?
@_date: 2014-07-06 20:34:14
no one cares, by any definition of "spokesperson" you are wrong, and thusly your whole position has no merit

well it's pretty easy to track just make a few simple assertions
politicians can't raise taxes or they don't get elected  
politicians need money  
politicians make a bank that prints money  
in return for money the politicians do whatever the banks say  
lo and behold, the banks run the united states government now.  if you don't think so, figure out how much a human being is worth, then divide the national debt by that amount.  the government is OWNED millions of times over by the banks

miners know what a 51% situation is, they know more about MINING than you do.  what could possibly make you think that they need YOU to educate them about mining?
oh i forgot, it's because you're an idiot
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:34:52
are you an idiot? it's basically a stack of money you're bidding on.  no one is going to turn down an opportunity to buy 1.5 million dollars at the price of 500k or whatever the bid is going to be
BURN the us government? why would you assume this auction is their only option?  they can just as easily throw it on some exchange, or spend it anywhere else
@_date: 2014-07-06 19:11:35
just because no one is an official spokesperson for something doesn't mean ANYONE who is famous who says "i know nothing about bitcoin" is now a spokesperson for bitcoin
that's like saying bangladesh doesn't have a soccer team and anyone from bangladesh who says "i don't play soccer" is now their soccer team.  only extremely retarded people would think that
*eyes you*

**which is fine**, and i hope every CEO of a major company does exactly the same thing
hell it's like insider trading that can't be punished
@_date: 2014-06-16 22:00:59
because greed?
they'd rather write a page-long explanation telling you they're not going take actions that go against their economic principles rather than solve the problem easily on their end and lose a bit of money

he's extremely mad at himself for missing the bitcoin boat when it was 13$.  now he's trying to throw it under the bus as much as he can in order to get it to crash so he has a new chance to buy in
i know these types of people
@_date: 2014-06-18 23:58:46
and my point is if people don't need to use exchanges to use bitcoin then they don't need them for alt-coins.  which is what YOU are complaining about
@_date: 2014-06-15 20:39:32
they understand just fine, they don't care (for what is this now, the 5th time?)
you think people throwing toxic waste into the ocean don't know what they're doing? one more time, you're an idiot
@_date: 2014-06-26 04:05:40
it's just a FUD spreading way of claiming bitcoin has no government regulation without actually coming out and SAYING it directly, which would get people saying, "hey you idiot, bitcoin **is** regulated"
@_date: 2014-06-27 15:07:30
"crash" is a loose term.  if a mcdonalds has tourbuses of people from a music concert or something for 5 days then the concert ends and things **go back to normal** do we call that a crash?
this is not the same as the store getting tainted meat and foodpoisoning people and losing all business at that location for a month

good luck convincing people to turn down free money

you are
@_date: 2014-06-13 03:31:37
it would be funny in the sense that they know so little about the technology that they left it where it was...
@_date: 2014-06-18 21:21:20
it IS easily exchanged, i literally took .2 darkcoins i mined and turned it into bitcoin in 10 seconds then bought 5772 doge with it another 10 seconds later.  just because that gives YOU trouble doesn't mean people without learning disabilities will have a problem doing it
furthermore the only thing that's affected is payout.  you can buy into the game with like 17 different coins.  it'll turn them into dogecoin for use in the game and you only have to worry about it when you take them out
again if you don't like it, don't play.  no big deal
@_date: 2014-06-15 21:12:01
no they don't care about you and your silly campaign to inform them about things they already know about
nor do they care about the stability of the coins they mine, this falls under the category of "not my problem" which i already covered in my first response to you
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:29:48
here's an actual statement from the professor
"i didn't buy in like any smart people did at 10$ so i decided to claim that bitcoin would fall in order to buy in when it did.  unfortunately no one is stupid enough to actually listen to me.  so now my reputation is shot to shit and i still don't have any bitcoin."
there you have it

say there's a beach people can just walk in and sift through the sand and come up with gold.  the owners of the beach get a portion of the gold people find.  now say it can accomodate 500 people before bad things happen, people get trampled by others can't get enough air and suffer heatstroke and die, whatever
now the beach can shut the doors and LIMIT the amount of people that enter, OR the people joining can look for themselves and see that it's not safe
guess what happens?  neither of those things
the beach owners will say "hey, i don't care.  people should self regulate it's not my problem"
the diggers will say "hey, why does everyone else get to dig and i don't? i'm going in anyways"
the end result is without third party intervention nothing changes.  people will not act responsibly unless there are **consequences** for acting irresponsibly
@_date: 2014-06-05 17:55:29
he doesn't have a point, before snowden came forward all you had was speculation
tell anyone you want but without proof you're just a moon-landing denier or a multiple-shooter troll.  the reason he's in hiding and has had to give up his life and future is because he brought proof to the table
the whole "i could have been snowden, i've been telling people for years that they been spying on us" is horseshit.  you don't work there, and you can't bring proof of your claims

his claims are completely unsubstantiated, until they actually see their profits drop they won't move.  and one person doing this won't make a difference
@_date: 2014-06-22 20:07:18
mostly because anyone in government that supports bitcoin is completely untrustworthy.  either they don't know who owns the hand that feeds them, or they're trying to scam the community out of support and campaign funds
saying you support bitcoin comes with some pretty stringent prerequisites if you intend to defend it against a government who might seek to undermine it.  a congressman that understands the technology is already unbelievable enough, but willing to jeopardize his career in order to champion its causes?
i think we have every right to be skeptical
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:42:34
as long as there's a benefit to hashing on the largest pool, then it will continue to happen
you think one person jumping off makes a difference? as soon as people leave, other people look at the less than 51% pool and say "you know what? i can make 5% more coin by switching to geico!
then you're back where you started
if you built incentives to centralize into your system don't be surprised when that's exactly what happens

at places people buy books i suppose.  sci-fi section prolly if you're in a brick&amp;mortar
neal stephenson is pretty well known, they should have it
@_date: 2014-06-02 02:59:21
if you get a chance to read cryptonomicon by stephenson he features the philippines heavily.  his book was way ahead of its time in many respects, outlining the need for digital anonymous currency and illustrating one way that it could happen (a fictitious nation "kinakuta" declares a hands-off policy regarding all data in its borders allowing the creation of a "data-haven")
@_date: 2014-05-27 09:00:01


no value but it converts to fiat, yeah that makes sense...
doge is involved with philanthropy because it gives us something to do, and that's what a community is.  people with similar mindsets gathering together to do things.  philanthropy just happens to be what our community does.  it would still do the same thing if our coin had the same buying power as bitcoin, except we'd be funding much heavier hitting programs
bitcoin itself is no stranger to charity, so even in that sense you are proven wrong as well.  you don't have to make a post justifying why you don't donate, you can choose to say nothing.  but you decided to double down on advertising how much of a toolbag you are...
@_date: 2014-07-06 22:34:38
why are you trying to argue about something that i didn't even say was a problem?
you said he was a spokesperson.  he's not.  i corrected **that part**
i don't give two fucks about anything else you said

no you idiot, he predicted a crash.  satoshis have always been under 10$ so how would that be a crash
morons upvoting you too... god damn people here are as stupid as bitcorn is
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:28:40
yep.  people put NOTHING at risk themselves by going public and making extremely uninformed predictions.  it's high time they pay for being idiots
@_date: 2014-07-01 13:55:50
just goes to show that crypto has a long way to go before people stop thinking of it as "fake money"
plus people are for the most part, retarded
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:28:45
what currency they decide to use is completely arbitrary, if you decide not to play just because they use yen instead of dollars, francs instead of  rupees, seashells instead of feathers then that's your problem
every crypto is easily exchanged at any number of the 50 billion exchanges that are running now.  if your hangups for some inconsequential detail such as which currency they're using for their back-end prevents you from playing so be it
the world continues to spin

it does make them evil, because they're actively fucking people over when **they have the option to NOT DO SO while looking for other solutions**
like saying "we know dumping toxic waste in the ocean is bad, but instead of stopping the production of it we're gonna continue to do so till someone else finds a solution that doesn't hurt us financially"
@_date: 2014-07-06 21:32:57

trust me, i'd love to be on the side of "one of us" on the inside.  it's just gonna take some significant convincing
@_date: 2014-06-19 00:31:00
moolah takes 17 coins including bitcoin.  so again, you have no legs to stand on and are just spouting complete nonsense
"i only use bitcoin and nothing else" is stupid.  there are people that use tacocoin and nothing else.  everyone gets to use an exchange and should.  if you don't like it, don't play
@_date: 2014-07-06 05:35:38
but he's not... he specifically says he doesn't know how bitcoin works
how does that make him a spokesperson for it?
@_date: 2014-06-18 21:44:56
sure they will, how else will they get bitcoin to begin with? or do you expect everyone playing to go out and buy a miner, sign up for a pool, AND THEN import their bitcoin into the game to play it?
@_date: 2014-06-18 22:34:03
same with **any** alt-coin.  so what's your problem?
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:09:26
you obviously didn't read/understand a single thing in my reply
i'll make it easier for you:
*if something is everyone's problem, then it's no one's problem*
if you can't punish the people exploiting then things will always get exploited.  you want to know why the US national debt is 17 trillion? because short term gain will always be chosen, regardless of the price that's to be paid long term
**especially** in cases where there's zero accountability for the actions.  especially in cases where the actions are shared by a multitude.  "why should someone else get to stay and get 5% more? i'm not leaving."
both of which are applicable in the case of large pool mining
@_date: 2014-06-17 12:59:36
because they don't get the same amount of gold.  obviously
