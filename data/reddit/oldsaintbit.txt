I see where you guys are coming from. I have been simply doing a few cents as I test out the bot. I will hopefully be tipping more once people decide to donate to the bot.
@_date: 2015-01-25 19:47:53
were you the one with the idea ? I really thought it was a great idea and have been planing to make this for awhile now. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 21:24:56
I was hoping people would like the idea and decide to donate. I would then pool the money together and tip a few dollars worth of bitcoin. I have only been doing a few cents to test out the bot as I edit it. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 21:05:52
Thanks, this will be used to help others become aware of bitcoins.

Thanks, your tip will help tip other redditors in the future.

I'm going to see what options I have available for funding. I like the idea of using lighthouse. However, I don't know how i can convince people to trust that I'll tip all the money. Thanks for the biggest tip so far. I'm working on ways to make it more visible where the money is going.

You seem extremely pissed about something pretty irrelevant. If you would have fully read the comments and what I wrote you would have seen that I used the .10$ to just test out my bot because I'm not made of money. Since i have finalized some more stuff I am waiting until I have more money to donate. This guys intentions are to only tip cents, mine are to give larger amounts of money which hopefully doesn't seem insulting. "Heres five dollars" "who the hell wants five dollars, you prick" is something I don't see happening. I'm trying to help the community, don't be a prick.

You don't think this would work as a marketing strategy for bitcoin? I can't think of any one who would get annoyed by receiving 5$ worth if bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:08:22
Yes it does. I am waiting until this changetip account has a little more money in it. I will than be tipping larger amounts of money. Happy Bitcoining. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:25:32
And people who say that won't collect, no harm no foul. That money will then be used on someone else.
@_date: 2015-01-25 19:19:52
awkward, I forgot to change that in the final version that actually posts haha. all changed now.

Maybe I'll turn it into a reddit bot that simply tips posts with a lot of upvoting. "your comment is popular here is $" or something"
@_date: 2015-01-25 19:22:58
You think so? I was planning on donating a couple dollars instead of only cents if enough people support. I would not be irritated if someone sent me five dollars. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 22:34:18
hmmm I'm pretty sure I posted something like this a few hours ago.

I wanted to first just bring awareness to the bot in the hopes that people would donate so I can increase the tip size. If i did tips of 5$ i could only do a few. I just simply don't have enough money. Hopefully if this catches son some more people will donate so I don't have to fund the entire thing. 
and just because thats not what it was designed for doesn't make it a bad idea.

There is no interaction necessary. They are just sitting back and receiving free money. I understand if tipping a few cents might be irritating but thats why Im hoping to increase the amount tipped to a few dollars. Is there no way you would see this as being useful ?
@_date: 2015-01-25 17:54:31
Ok, I will look into having it donate top comments more and making sure its not the same person.
@_date: 2015-01-25 19:56:42
haha, thats probably how I thought of this name then. Everyday is Bitmas. Happy bitcoining.

I apologize, I never realized people were going to die because they received 10 cents. more than half actually thanked me but thats besides the point. So apparently I'm not allowed to test it because I didn't have a 100$ laying around to tip 20 people. There have really one been a few people that didn't like the idea, the majority has told me its great if I'm able to do it. I'm still trying to figure out why your so mad, but whatever.  And like I said plenty of times now, I have stopped tipping change and will only continue when I have enough money. Go freak out on another post.

similar to what I commented on a different comment. I like the idea, I'm just not sure how to go about gaining everyones trust ? I'll research it further. if we had a few thousand dollars we could definitely get reddit talking.

The issue most people have is that it is considered spammy to just tip people a few cents. I have spent the day talking with a bunch of people about it.
@_date: 2015-01-25 20:41:57
I will try and incorporate these in the next update.
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:08:17
You don't think this will spark anyones interest ? If someone just gave me a couple dollars online I would defiantly look into it more.
@_date: 2015-01-25 20:51:41
will be added. Thanks for the suggestion. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 19:09:38
@_date: 2015-01-25 21:11:18
Would you be happier if I edited it so that it would tip the most upvoted comment on a popular submission ? It seems as if most people like that idea.
