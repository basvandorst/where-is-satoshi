My problem is that i'm not able to receive coins. I use this service to check my adress  and it say that my adress is not valid, and other services in this kind too

Yes that was exactly the site what I've found but as you said they ask for ID and photos. I really don't like the idea of giving such informations. So i'll test circle.com. 
I tried to send you back your bits but greenadress tell me that I don't have enough money Oo is that normal ?

Ok thank you 8292092 what kind of service do you use to check if an adress is valid or not ? It would be great if you tell me :D

Yes it seems I have to wait before I can send you back, i'll test it in a few minutes. Did you know a place for buy for example 10 us of bitcoin ? with paypal and no need to send personnal information like my ID and others ?

ok but only for the test I tested a faucet (a lot actually) like  and they keep saying my bitcoin adress is not good. I only wanted a bitcoin wallet because I'm curious about the thing maybe I should open another wallet without P2SH ? But it seems greenadress are the best or one of  the bests so. Sory for taking your time !

ok thanks for your help mate, I think I'll buy a part of a bitcoin but that seems really difficult too. Anyway thanks again for your time !
