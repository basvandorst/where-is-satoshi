No, there is no extra spending involved. You buy stuff online while using their referral link and they gain referral income of which they give something back to you. I've used them to buy a new Notebook for 800 Euros and got 50 Euros back.

Never heard of your site, had a look and it looks really good. I have some questions before trying it though:
Since other people are buying stuff for me (in Amazons perspective), what if I need to return some item?
What personal information are provided to potential buyers?
What if an order does not get bought by anyone a specific amount of time? Would it be possible to change the wanted discount level in that case?
What's the maximum viable discount?
