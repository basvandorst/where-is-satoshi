Then we just need to make sure we have a nice dip fund to buy more at the bottom.

So you DO see the address you sent to in your Addresses list? And there is zero balance on that specific address in Electrum, but that same number shows as having coins in blockchain, correct?

You need to be set up on either QuadrigaCX or Coinsquare.io. You can send your existing coins there and trade/sell/cashout etc, or buy new coins there. Do not buy from Coinbase once you are set up in a CDN exchange. Coinbase charges a higher rate.

How many nodes does electrum currently show you are connected to?

Please step away from the bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:38:43
Look at your Addresses tab in Electrum (view &gt; show addresses). Do you see the exact string you sent your coins to in there? Find the same line in there, then compare it to the data on blockchain to see where it was actually sent. If the numbers match, then you can still work out getting the coins. If the strings do not match.. Not good news I am afraid.

Really? I'm still seeing about 5.5 at the blockchain link. Anything to do with that coinbase sell wall that's up now?

What is to be learned? That it is super expensive to transfer btc funds, or there is a way the OP could have lowered his cost? Just wondering as I am just about to do a similar transfer as the OP.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:14:27
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:10:50
Yes, yes and yes. Instant transactions actually.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:20:36
This is correct. If you could get coins from public keys, we would all be rich, and broke.

Better chance of reaching Elsa than contacting coinbase support.

Have you tried changing to another server? Tools &gt; Network &gt; Server
I have needed to do that several times in the past to make the missing coins show up.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:46:34
Ok so you DO own the keys. You still own the coins. The issue is Electrum local client is not syncing to the servers properly to connect them to you yet. First, reboot and relaunch the app. Does that work, if not then shut down electrum, back up your wallet, download a new/updated electrum and reinstall. Import your wallet and try to force a server reconnect.

I wouldn't know. Coinbase does not allow selling from Canadian accounts.

That is a very centralized comment for a decentralized commodity.

Having my coins on an exchange allowed me to insta-sell when the price dropped recently before it got too low. Originally bought 4 at $3k CDN per - sold 4 at $14k CDN on the way down, and bought 8 at $7k at the bottom. Doubled my coins. Now that the price is back at $14k CDN, my original investment of $12k a year ago is now worth over $100k CDN. This would not have happened if my coins were safely stored away in full HODL mode.
