He is talking about the whole bitcoin ecosystem, not only one client.

There are more than 2% of btc1 nodes according to 
And this will probably change even more towards November.
@_date: 2017-08-28 01:15:11


Do you have a source for this number?

Core could survive by offering a hardfork with different proof-of-work.
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:53:07
Miners should follow their economic incentives. Nothing else.
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:45:14
Everybody can propose hardforks. Hashpower and economic incentives decide whether the fork happens and whether one side or both survive.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:21:32
I have been around probably longer than you and read all the white papers. But the topic of this thread is not LN.
Even though I prefer a rather radical version of freedom of speech, I would agree to a small amount of moderation but not based on arbitrary rules. And most importantly only if moderation logs are public. Otherwise I will assume the system is being abused.

It is not professional. If you don't have insider information it is just gambling. Just make a bitcoin bet on your favorite gambling website.

I am not sure what would happen if all the miners temporarily change to BTCC. I guess there would have been an equilibrium that wouldn't shut down BTC.
If anything I am disappointed by miners to not run a 51% attack on BTCC. They should just steal some of the BTCC coins with chain reorgs and double-spends. But it seems they are not greedy enough.
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:05:22
What do you mean by "Who decided that hard fork?". See my reply above: outcomes of hardforks are decided by miners and economic incentives. Or are you asking who provides the software for a hardfork?
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:02:43
Do not trade. If you see news that makes you want to trade based on the news it is way to late.
@_date: 2017-08-26 03:45:26
People criticise certain aspects of lightning networks. These open discussions are necessary to develop actual applications.
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:19:18
Only if you have nearly 100% nonmining nodes rejecting blocks. Even 5% of nodes that forward the blocks would keep the network running. Remember, the Internet (and p2p networks) are designed to survive even nuclear attacks by re-routing information around attackers.
@_date: 2017-08-26 05:07:33


There are only people with and without insider information. If you call people doing vodoo technical analysis professionals you can as well use a crystal ball.
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:08:34
You are clearly misunderstanding satoshi.


Satoshi did *not* anticipate non-mining nodes in his paper. So he is talking about &gt;51% of **mining** nodes controlling the network.
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:45:53
Who is doing these spam attacks? Who is paying for it?
@_date: 2017-08-27 04:05:05
If the transaction demand stays the same like now it will never confirm.
@_date: 2017-08-28 01:44:57
Something tells me that non listening nodes are not really important. But twist your world however you like it.
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:44:08
Go push your altcoin somewhere else, redditor for 2 weeks.
@_date: 2017-08-26 05:48:34
Yeah, these 1-2% of empty blocks wold have reduced the fees a lot! Maybe you should read up on the reasons for empty blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:21:05
3) would use the marketcap, which is a bit easier to measure. If someone can control the marketcap by changing it by 1% he would certainly have power over bitcoin (centralisation). 
Such power could be realized through hashpower, controlling bitcoins, politics, development decisions etc. So it covers a lot of different types of decentralisation.
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:48:35
Didn't miners want bigger blocks + segwit? This would help scaling.
@_date: 2017-08-29 01:38:04
You guys are so sweet.
@_date: 2017-08-28 01:04:42


You should talk to the music industry then. They would be very interested in banning users from p2p networks.


I am surprised you believe this is the case. It is a bit delusional.
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:03:46
Currently miners are getting 12.5 btc per block mined (block reward). This will be decreased in the future to reduce inflation. Thus, in the future fees are supposed to replace the block reward.
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:44:39
Some possibilities to define decentralisation:
1) Cost to take down the bitcoin network.
2) Average cost to de-anonymise a bitcoin user.
3) Cost to reduce market cap by 1%.
Any other suggestions?
@_date: 2017-08-28 12:06:52
Thanks for the worries, I know the difference very well.
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:11:53
Not sure whether I can follow you. After a hardfork, a user should update before making transactions. How is this related to decentralisation?
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:53:06


There are many good reasons for occasional empty blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-27 23:39:45


You mean because the polls don't support your opinion they are wrong? Oh my...
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:41:26
Then you probably never posted criticism of segwit or positive things about segwit2x and other scaling solutions.
@_date: 2017-08-27 23:45:52
Curious, can you point me to the part were non-mining nodes contribute to consensus? How are they banning miners?
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:23:32
Just realise that if you read news on bitcoin or see a price change then it is already much to late to react on it. So just relax and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:58:38
Might be because segwit2x actually has &gt;30% support.
@_date: 2017-08-27 03:24:02
By rejecting certain blocks? Sorry, it is not that easy to take down p2p networks.
Running a node that is not used for transactions by other people has the same effect like putting a flag in your front yard. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:44:25


Again, nonmining nodes cannot prevent blocks from propagating. What satoshi is writing about is how a SPV client can be warned about an invalid block. This would only have implications for a merchant running a SPV client.
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:59:08
You are mentioning altcoins all the time.
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:41:08
1) People like segwit because it fixes transaction malleability and it will increase transaction capacity by 70%. People don't like it because it changes the block structure, which is a major change to the protocol.
2) A majority of people wants segwit. Some people prefer only increasing blocksize for scaling. Others want both. For the "why?" see above.
3) There was the fork to btccash (increasing blocksize from 1 MB to 8 MB without segwit). And there is another fork coming up to double the blocksize of the existing bitcoin with segwit already activated (segwit2x). Mining will be split across all the surviving chains.
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:57:10
You are iterating this a few times already. But you cannot ban a node in a p2p network. This would only work if you control nearly 100% of the nodes the malicious node is connecting to.
And it would be easy and cheap for the attacker to spin up additional nodes.
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:20:51
Is your node doing anything meaningful? Running a big business or exchange?
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:26:31
It is under "Wallet Details".
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:53:37
Fees to buy bitcoin with fiat are 1% to 20%, depending on the exchange you are using and your payment method.
Within half an hour you need to pay with PayPal or credit card or find a btc atm. In this case probably you pay 20% fees.
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:57:14
When I was young, you could play around with bitcoin to get used to it. 
I would be scared starting now and not being able to make test transactions to get used to the system.
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:13:58
Because your fee was not high enough.
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:13:07


Well, there are other ways to verify blockchain transactions with minimal trust.
If you blindly run a node that doesn't support 2x you might lose some of your wealth via replay attacks.
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:40:17
2 MB sounds like a reasonable change. Why do most Core developers object it so much? The increase would save us so much trouble and people could focus on actual bitcoin development again.
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:55:21
Then let's have a constructive discussion about centralization risks of the lightning network here...
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:07:09
It is not only shady, but tends to make people ignore technical arguments and support the other side because of freedom of speech.

What is a china-coin and how is it different to the current bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-06 06:32:22


I will alienate any company that ignores PoW and calls a minority chain Bitcoin. Hopefully most other users will do the same.
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:33:35
The loss in market cap is mostly due to Ethereum, BCH, LTC. These currencies do not have crazy amounts of premined coins or noncirculating coins.
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:37:22
Oh my... ignore the data and call me a shill. Makes you look stupid.
@_date: 2017-09-06 06:29:31


Good that Bitcoin has a quite efficient consensus mechanism that solves this problem. We will see in November.
@_date: 2017-09-06 06:12:33


I am not against Bitcoin, but just because something is scarce doesn't make it automatically valuable.
@_date: 2017-09-02 04:27:23


And the rest is eaten up by the risk of losing money at an exchange. Unfortunately there is still a quite high chance of exchanges getting hacked/shut down. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:47:09


How can this be blamed on them? Isn't that like asking Coca Cola to give more market share to Pepsi?
@_date: 2017-09-06 06:42:03


If the Bitcoin core implementation fails to provide a sustainable scaling solution it might be useful to have an alternative development team. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:58:11


Did you actually read my post? Market cap is only a problem for currencies that have large amounts of non-circulating coins. This might be true for Ripple etc. But not for the cryptocurrencies that I mentioned.
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:57:07
You are kind of sweet. Never found such a strange mixture of lack of understanding the basics while simultaneously being condescending. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:12:21
Thanks! According to the picture the fee is 0.3% to get BTC out of GDAX. Do you know what kind of transfer method is used between GDAX and Fiat?
@_date: 2017-09-03 09:05:43
Average transaction fees are continuously increasing.
What is the point about these posts that everything is fine whenever fees are temporarily low?
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:57:16
He didn't what? The tweet is about BIP148 (UASF).
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:07:53
The median is following exactly the same trend:
The problem is that fees are at an unsustainable level. Bitcoin will just continue to lose market share to altcoins if this is not fixed.
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:24:13


This trend is more related to increased adoption and started much earlier than BCH (which just started beginning of August).


Well, I find it quite alarming that Bitcoin lost 40% market share since the beginning of this year.
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:14:33
Yes, terrible those countries. Includes US and UK if I remember correctly.
@_date: 2017-09-03 07:10:41


Wow, that sounds great. Will have a closer look into this.
@_date: 2017-09-03 03:20:02
What are the fees to get USD onto the exchange? And the fees to get your BTC out of the exchange?
@_date: 2017-09-04 10:46:57
Asia and Europe doesnt pay anything to send money within your country (and often even across borders).
@_date: 2017-09-07 06:52:55


Who is "you"? Bitcoin is not owned by anyone.
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:10:47
Roger Ver is generally criticizing the high fees. Calling him a liar because the fees are low at weekends is a bit weird.

Which hardfork did he create? I thought he always supported HK agreement and Segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-09-05 04:43:22

How did Jihan try to poke holes in bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:28:03
I cannot follow your logic. You do not need to like segwit to support HKA and NYA. It is called a compromise.
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:28:15


You must be joking. BCH and BTC share the same history which makes the marketcap comparable.


This is totally meaningless, since most crypto mining revenue is dominated by block rewards. Only bitcoin is tipping towards fees because of full blocks.


After all your nonsense that is something you should work on.
@_date: 2017-09-06 07:28:09
Useful layer 2 solutions will probably take another 3 years. If they will ever work.
