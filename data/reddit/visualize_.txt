What if your house burns down. I hope the safe is resistant to high temperature
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:51:05
Lol if you are at even a small profit then I wouldn't be sad at all. Perhaps you could buy back in at a smaller amount if you really wanted to hold BTC
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:42:00
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:11:38
It's situational. If you bought at like 15k and your automatic sells didn't go through at your target, you might as well just bite the cost of holding because this shit is nothing new, the cycle just restarted. 
Now if you are still in the profit, sure why not sell. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:14:30
Yeah and guess what, this shit is said every single time. It's all in cycles, and there's a lot of "mini" bubbles but the true large bubble encompassing crypto seems still pretty far from being popped because it isn't mainstream yet

Just make sure to trade with people who have an established trade history. Their profile will tell you the amount of trades they have done and their rating. For an amount like 2k, try searching for the best user possible (I think some people have over 5k trades done on the site). They also have escrow in the site, so theres some protection there also.
Theres a lot of different users who do direct transfers with different banks. I never heard of that bank before, but if its somewhat large then surely someone can do it so you can get BTC the same day.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:23:56
well no one is holding a gun to your head to hold? Do what you want lol. The main premise for people saying HODL is because most people hold the belief that BTC will be worth a lot in the years to come. But yes, if you take the time to learn about the market and can time it right, you would probably be better off buying and selling continuously. Or do both (hold, and buy and sell a portion of your holdings as a hedge)
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:30:39
Huge fees are a problem, but its not enough to stop the BTC train yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:39:06
I really doubt it will go below 10k. There should be a lot of support at 11k and even greater amount of support at 10k
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:48:06
bound to happen at some point. a lot of it is pretty much emotion and weak hands continually sell because they panic.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:58:51
I honestly don't understand why people are like this. Pleasure in seeing the misfortune of others, what is this middle school? grow the fuck up lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:20:46
well you can easily tell what type of person OP is with how he conveys his message. yikes
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:57:31
Lol its cute seeing people worry. When you have been in the game long enough this shit is meaningless. Just buckle up and wait for the 2018 gains

11k-11.5k is what I see. I want to buy more but I don't want to stay up all night to find out where the bleeding stops lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:43:27
looks like its time for you to go to bed.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:01:39
lol what are you even talking about
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:16:01
They inflate the buy prices as the fee for buying BTC (i think by like 1.5-2%), but they use the regular market value for when you sell
or it could be just market values moving fast because Coinbase already a section for added fees for using Coinbase. I honestly think they purposely have a higher value for buying BTC though
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:20:58
How would you not qualify this as a major crash?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:00:14
When BTC has a massive drop, (almost) everything else falls with it because BTC is the staple crypto currency and the health of the market is still pretty dependent on whats happening with it
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:34:59
I don't know man if you hate losers you probably should take a good look at your mirror.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:26:39
Guys not everyone just holds their coins. Some of us actually trades it actively. Do you know how annoying it would be if we has to transfer EACH coin to a desktop wallet or a hardware wallet back and forth. It's just not feasible especially if you invest in a lot of lesser known coins 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:55:07
Well alt coins price are highly related to BTC price and they get affected on both ends. When BTC has a huge red day a lot of people just pull out of all cryptos but when BTC rallies, a lot of people sell off alts to buy BTC. I wouldn't say sell offs are because they think its useless though. People are just trying to take profit or probably majority of people are cutting losses because they invested recently at the 16k+ level
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:20:01
I honestly would not suggest anyone selling their BTC to a random stranger with PayPal. way to easy to just get screwed over by unauthorized claim disputes. 
OP, if you can wait until morning use Local Bitcoins. Its really simple to figure out. You can meet with someone in person or do a wire transfer. You still will be safe because a lot of these people have so much reputation built up
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:14:02
"lose everything"
@_date: 2015-12-14 04:17:41
What's wrong with LBC? You can try trading with random users here, or on forums but be very careful!
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:08:37
Well yeah obviously the most optimal situation is you sold at 19k. But lets says you bought at 14k, it goes to 16k and you sell. But from 16k it keeps going up and up and theres a lot of uncertainty what buying low actually means now. 
A lot of people just remove the complication of continuously following the market and just hold because they have the belief that Bitcoin is going to be worth a lot in the long term and they find little value in day trading. Theres nothing wrong in either strategy, its just preference.
tl;dr: hindsight is 20/20
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:41:30
yeah and Bitcoins graph looked like the bubble theory so many times. Long story short this is nothing new and it always rises back in the long term.
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:12:01
uh ok...
I don't get the point of the post. It's pretty meaningless and doesn't provoke discussion. Like do you want a pat on the back or something?
@_date: 2017-03-27 22:56:39
Just seems like an extreme pump and dump. The coin was released in 2011 and I don't see any indication of how it fixes anything
@_date: 2017-01-13 04:44:05
Its pretty infuriating to read your posts because you are so vague. All you had to say was it's bad because their security is historically flawed, but instead you keep saying, it's bad because it's bad. And then you go on to say there are better alternatives out there, then list none...
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:48:18
Damn. Gottem
@_date: 2017-01-13 01:31:38
A huge userbase used Circle specifically for BTC because it was super easy to obtain it using their service. Now you can't get BTC from them anymore
@_date: 2017-01-13 03:54:20
Why is blockchain a bad wallet? Always was pretty reliable except for today where my transaction won't get any confirmations
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:49:13
I really doubt this has any large influence on BTC prices lol
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:54:14
haven't kept up with crypto in awhile. Is the bloodbath today in response to some news?
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:54:45
you mean 20/20 lol
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:53:11
fragments in case it bleeds further so you can cost average
@_date: 2016-12-25 16:52:18
But that shit back. Your 401K is suppose to be your future not your suicide 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:40:40
There was an upcoming fork similar to how Bitcoin Cash came around. This new thing people were more afraid of because it was viewed more as a hostile takeover of BTC, which is why people were glad this was cancelled. However, people have been putting their money in BTC because the fork would also give all BTC owners a free coin, which is probably why BTC has been rallying the past couple of weeks. I am unsure how this will effect BTC going forward price wise
@_date: 2016-02-19 14:55:42
I'm doing my EE on Bitcoin too.  What exactly are you researching about Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-02-19 15:17:54
I don't see how it matters, but okay.  Just asking because the survey seemed pretty broad 
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:27:33
I was so confused what Black Mirror was supposed to be about after watching the first episode. I honestly thought it was a comedy show at first, but you should just keep watching the other episodes because they are really good (and a lot more different)
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:24:50
Haven't you heard of cost averaging? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:18:24
I don't see where he said the crash is over. And I think the flawed assumption is that what happened in the past will ALWAYS continue happening in the future. However its still early in the game that is a relatively safe assumption that market cycles will keep repeating. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:36:39
TA applies to crypto fine 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:35:51
Obviously the floor adjusts one the resistance zone failed? Like after it kept dropping past 12k it as a pretty clear crash, but it tests lines of major support which are predicted as floors, and if you have to keep moving it then so be it. 
This was a killer day and the next zone is in mid 5k. Maybe smart money comes in maybe it doesn't, but if they do come in then it would be very likely they do come in at that level. If not then we wait to the next support line. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:31:41
This could not have been formatted any worse
