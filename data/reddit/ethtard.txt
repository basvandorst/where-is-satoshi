It is sad. But is actually the one who started making it political. If you can't see how the person behind is (in)directly Roger Ver, then I feel bad for you. 1) Posts everything on gets a lot of MSM attention for donating to charities and gain goodwill. 2) Out of nowhere start posting on instead of making false claims: calling it "Bitcoin Core" (classic Roger), overpaying fees x5-x10 (classic Roger), trying to convince companies to accept BCash "To BitPay and Coinbase, please support Bitcoin Cash as soon as you can. This isn't working." (Classic Roger), Always says "we" and then suddenly "Given that the Pineapple Fund has been a one person project with a busy life, I'd like to spend as little time micromanging the bitcoin network as possible.". (Classic narcissist (Roger)). The funds also came (partially) from Bitfinex and we know that Roger send a lot of Bitcoin there in November. Step 3) Go full MSM and claim how Bitcoin is useless and they're only going to use BCash from now on.

try with noscript, it gives that result

Then youre a very irresponsible person². 90% of networth in a speculative volatile asset is stupid. Hard fork without proper prepartion, testing and other improvements is also stupid.

bandwidth isnt the issue, issue is processing the blocks. max size is 4 MB, there are alot of tests from that size on testnet but that requires all transactions to be segwit compatible. in the current state it's already 2.1 MB, just from P2SH txs, and if more wallets implement segwit it will just keep increasing.

you do realize that LN is also on BU roadmap right? read

x4 current amount... on average thats 1500-2000 txs in 1 block so 6000-8000

it wasnt a photoshop and not by him and he didnt post it here, was someone else. it is Obvious manipulation by Roger to pull things out of context

no, quoting something on twitter without the most important part '25 years from now' is intentionally misinterpreting it

hard fork: everyone needs to upgrade or nodes that dont get kicked off the network; soft fork: not everyone has to upgrade, older nodes will still work but they just cant see everything. they chose for soft fork because there are a lot of old nodes on the bitcoin network that never get updated see:

stop trolling, did you actually check everything? dont make up bs 
@_date: 2016-11-27 11:10:18
yes, its already proven that if you would implement BU in the current state it would keep forking because of no consensus because everyone can set their own requirments

its about priorities, first they want to optimize and organise the space they have in the blocks, after that they will see when bigger blocks are needed
@_date: 2016-11-27 13:34:13
not if all wallet providers update to segwit and in current circumstances its already 2.1 MB
