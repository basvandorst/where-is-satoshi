this is the problem. its not even clear if theres a place in the world for crypto. bitcoins a speculation bubble and altcoins are penny stocks.
@_date: 2018-09-09 05:50:02
You just said a load of nonsense. Bitcoins value is completely unstable. 'stable functionality' is a nonsense term you just made up and even then is completely bollocks as shown by bitcoins completely crippling fees early this year.
And if bitcoin became widely used as a currency one day, instead of just being exchanged for fiat, prices would become extremely deflationary, the rich would become wealthier, wages would consistently deflate over time etc.

Bitcoin is nothing but it's relationship with fiat. The price of products in society increasing is inflation.
@_date: 2018-08-22 11:55:38
This is nonsense. Deflation is not inherently bad.  Bitcoin also experiences extreme deflation.
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:12:56
are you stupid?
bitcoins deflation is thousands of times worse than the dollars inflation.
if you borrowed $500 of bitcoin for a car two years ago you would be declaring bankruptcy over that debt now. inflation is not a charge.
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:45:40
You don't borrow £10 then pay back £10 adjusted for inflation/deglation + fixed percentage. You pay full appreciation/depreciation.
Otherwise I'd just borrow 100btc  now then just pay back 10btc if the value increases. The ridiculous 'pay pack adjusted value' means the loanee gets all the increased value while the loaner loses out. It'd allow risk free speculation just by borrowing money from everyone.
@_date: 2018-08-21 14:58:31
@_date: 2018-08-22 12:30:01
No it's not. It's a speculation bubble for an intangible asset with minimal practical use.
It's a milliom times more likely to collapse than the dollar. It's value is a measure of how likely people think other people will buy into the hype.

btc isnt its own thing its valued in dollars what i explained is deflation
its why 1 btc got you an apple 5 years ago but 1 btc now gets you a bag of cocaine. its real value has increased. deflation increases the value of currency.
but your response shows holy fuck you know literally nothing about economics at all you're literally gambling your money wildly on bitcoins

'government decides value of money ' no it doesn't
'cash can't be traced and bitcoin is 100% traceable' followed by 'everyone is tracing your cash but bitcoin can't be'
It's harder to obtain and transfer bitcoin than fiat money. By a fucking long shot.

Deflation is not increase in value of the currency.
Any bitcoin would be hugely deflationary if the supply was static. The rich would horde, prices would increase and their power and wealth would decrease while everyone else debt becomes unserviceable.

Bitcoin isn't that and 'better money' isn't a magic bullet.
And if bitcoin eliminates inflation/deflation as people here describe, what happens when the supplies run out? If prices don't change as people horde static wealth, money will just run out.
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:38:14
So deflationary. Meaning the cost of your debt would ever be increasing, eventually to the point where it becomes crippling and unserviceable.
So that 1 bitcoin loan you took out on your house looks a bit rough now houses cost .5bitcoins and you earn .05bitcoins pa

It's impossible to track all money so that's not gonna happen, nor is there any reason to think that's the goal. It's likely to go all digital eventually, but it'll happen naturally and there's no way to force it.
There's no way limiting large deposits/sales in case achieves that end, as it only impacts launderers and criminals in any real way

Lmfao what
You don't even know what the words you're using mean you buffoon. Deflating increases the value of money. It's why bitcoins not currently usable as a real currency because you have to change the price of everything on a minute to minute basis.
@_date: 2018-08-21 06:16:37
Deflationary currency is great, it means loaning/borrowing doesn't work due to ever spiralling value. Basically, it'd lead to the 1% owning literally everything.
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:17:56
Ok so it's inflationary/deflationary like any other currency then. It's purchasing power will fluctuate.
@_date: 2018-05-08 09:32:35

bitcoin has literally been undergoing deflation
it can literally go through inflation too. you clearly don't understand the very fundamentals of either bitcoin or fiat.

@_date: 2018-05-14 12:03:58
The loan won't be paid because of rampant deflation, which is why deflation is bad. It increases the value of debt.

inflation counters that in part. if it were deflationary with a static supply normal people would be using ever decreasing amounts (0.00001 etc) as the value of goods dropped in line with what people had, while that person who was hording moneys would increase dramatically.

bitcoin is deflationary! i got 1 btc for $20, now its worth $20,000! isnt that great! = i borrowed 1 btc to buy a pizza, now I'm a years wages in debt because i bought a fucking pizza. or, i got a mortgage on my house which i now have to default on because the monthly repayments going from $500 to $500,000 killed me.

Just saying fud isn't an argument, perhaps you'd like to refute their points?

Most of this stuff doesn't apply to banks in the UK. subservience to corporate America is the problem

pre-paid debit card - banking service
and are you saying you hold all of your money in crypto? everything you own? as in, in the past 6 months, you've lost 65%  or so of everything?
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:06:29
It's not. You can just look up the company and see they don't. It's a sticker.
@_date: 2018-06-03 18:20:46
if they're speaking a language thats one thing but bullshit are you picking out nationalities based on hair styles and mannerisms lmao 
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:13:56
My friend moved from the UK to Toronto.
He has a set limit of how many withdrawals he can make, monthly fees, charges for using other banks ATMs etc
All unheard of here.
@_date: 2018-06-19 17:23:14
It's just a sticker, not a taxi taking bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:35:49
i'd rather use a currency where the inflation and deflation are controlled.
@_date: 2018-06-23 23:41:59
how are you renting a car without a credit card? because they don't take prepaid debit cards.
seriously, you virgspergs need to research this a bit more carefully if you're gonna rollplay a bigboy on the internet.
but anyway, as confirmed, banks confirmed to offer an essential irreplacable service (no, just be a millionaire and buy a house outright! does not replace loans etc). i'm sorry your tried to undo the 'brain washing' by rinsing your brain in dog piss and battery acid.

Pump and dump
@_date: 2018-06-23 14:12:19
so you keep $30,000 in cash lying around in your house and walk around town with fistfuls of money stuffed in your pants incase you buy oomething? when  you shop online you just send them an envelope full of money?
fuck off shill. go pump and dump elsewhere.
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:52:40
so dont buy a house unless you have 100% of the money? no credit cards, no overdraft, no car finance, no mobile phone on contract?
you think eliminating all of those form society so you can have magic internet money with wild delation would work?
@_date: 2018-06-19 06:20:21
Because bitcoin being hyper deflationary wouldn't ever result in collapse.
@_date: 2018-06-02 10:26:51
making threats, fraud, fire in a theatre etc. there are plenty of limits on 'free speech'

It's not possible because what he takes will be mandated and recorded by his employer. It's a sticker

What about when you need to turn crypto to GBP so you can pay your mortgage? What % is thst
@_date: 2018-06-17 21:50:44
That's not intrinsic value. Gold has other uses, hence has some intrinsic value
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:40:45
it has intrinsic value because it has inherent uses. if the value of bitcoin collapses completely, you're left with nothing. completely worthless data. its value is fueled purely by speculation right now. Gold holds value because it has actual inherent uses beyond speculation, beyond some people will buy it incase other people want to buy it for more.
and we're talking about current investment, not the value of gold in the stone age. so thats irrelevant. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:59:38
because gold is an actual thing. it has value, it has uses, it has purpoes + speculation and investment.
btc is a useless nothing with no purpose whatsoever because of/besides rampant speculation. i expect its value will trend way, way down until a point where the fees drop enough to make it usable as a currency once again then it'll just sit there filling a niche. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:17:27
its being hoarded because it has intrinsic value/use. thats why its a store of value.  its value is largely stable, there will always be a call for gold because it has actual purpose.
bitcoins only purpose right now is buying it in the hope of a bigger idiot who will buy it from you for more.
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:41:31
theres nothing to get. Bitcoin has no real practical use or justification for its value.
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:43:53
Everyone loved dial up they just didn't like the speeds. The internet was always the shit.
Why would bitcoin be like that? What use do you envisage?
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:48:12
i'm explaining a concept to you, but you seem completely unable to grasp it and only extrapolate inane non sequiturs from it. 
gold isnt going to collapse because it has inherent value, inherent uses. and yes, gold is extremely easy to verify its not counterfeit lol
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:57:15
I'm not repeating myself anymore, bye.
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:28:31
gold has intrinsic value and uses, hence some semblance of stability
bitcoin, does not. that you're not grasping this very basic idea is another example of the bitcoin market is so fucked, so risky and nothing but a gamble. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:11:16
i mean, do i really have to list out uses of gold for you? jewelry, medicine, electronics etc.
bitcoins only value is what the speculation bubble put on it. it has no intrinsic value itself.  I bank transfer money to my friends via paypal, my bank etc and it costs me nothing and takes 1 second to clear.
@_date: 2018-03-31 10:04:30
'btc has the potential to be a competitor to gold'
except gold is a physical item with some intrinsic value and a store of wealth. bitcoin is an impractical currency not fit for purpose fueled by a speculation bubble.
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:29:19
Someone's lining up one more pump n dump
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:53:01
just because i can afford to lose money doesnt mean i want to or dont care when i do
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:18:33
and no practical use 
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:49:27
More features as in what? What practical uses of bitcoin do you see? 
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:16:12
had to check i wasnt on for a sec
@_date: 2018-07-05 12:15:28
Deflationary loans. The amount you owe increasing while paying it off lmao

It's not Doomsday stories. It's an explanation of why bitcoin isn't fit to supplant traditional currency

i don't beilve you've ever done anything important in your life, so how would your time be wasted?
continue to fundamentally misunderstand economics 101 while gambling your money on crypto. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 13:45:54
Less secure
Bad for credit 
No tangible benefits 
@_date: 2018-07-05 12:11:01
@_date: 2018-07-05 12:14:01
I don't get charged any of those things.
My bank account earns interest, has no fees, no foreign transaction charges etc
@_date: 2018-07-05 12:21:13
That's security. The fact someone could easily dupe you is a security flaw.
@_date: 2018-07-05 12:43:24
No, bitcoin won't replace fiat.
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:35:16
i just looked at bitrefill, only £5200 of bitcoin for a £5000 giftcard, bargain!
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:47:45
so theres no fee for using the app and you get 100% of the value of the bitcoin in usd?
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:08:51
if you sold on the high you could have bought a lot more when it dropped.
@_date: 2018-12-16 17:26:41
still in profit compared to the start, sure
75% down since its peak this time last year.
