I will sell you a toilet flush for 0.03 btc. I bet I can get you the water before GDAX can get anyone their crypto.

For the sweet, sweet rimjob of crypto love

I put in limit orders on the way down, and did maybe the largest (in USD) single-purchase I've ever done the instant it hit $10k.

I'll be switching to Gemini the instant I get back to the US. Currently working overseas.

This is Mercatox. Kind of an immature, poorly run exchange, but damn have they got some good prices sometimes. 
So they don't have enough BTC at any given address to cover a .99 btc, so they have to pool a bunch of addresses to cover it? They also have a slider to adjust your fee. In the past, 0.001 has been enough of a fee to clear in a few hours, and sometimes I'll bump it up a little, but it looks like they are having to use so many addresses in the tx that it bumps up the size large enough to make the fee insufficient. Does that sound right?

I'd have switched to Gemini months ago, but I'm overseas at the moment and don't have my +1 area code to make my account.

I placed my private keys in a safe deposit box. 
I copied the public keys so that I can still transfer, but when I decide to sell someday or if I want to move my larger holdings to more liquid medium, I'll have to go get them out.

They're citing the "founder of Bitcoin.com", though...

Exactly... We will surely see a several thousand dollar correction soon, but who's to say that the price won't rise at least that much before it happens?
Timing the markets is probably the wrong decision for all but the most hardcore technical investor.

Oh wow, let's bring that to fruition with a simple thought experiment...
BTC was at about $900 this time last year. GDAX has it now at 16k, almost a 1700% increase.
In USD, the total market cap of BTC (assuming you believe in the idea) is a little less than 300 million. The GDP of the US is a little less than 19 trillion. 
It kind of makes the whole idea a little disproportionate at the moment, and we haven't even spoken about currency exchanges in the (thousands of times over) larger traditional currency exchange world. It's just that you'd basically have to tax any capital gains from currency to such a high degree as to not make investing worth the effort in order to pay out any sort of noticeable capital loss to anyone who didn't invest.
The next counterargument might be that, well, maybe it's time that we eliminate currency investment. To do that, you either have to have a one-world government with oversight of all currencies, or you have to have a one-world currency. Well, a lot of the driving force behind crypto right now is that the zealots among the crypto communities believe that these new virtual currencies will do exactly that: be a one-world currency beyond government control.

I doubt anybody (for all practical purposes) with a license would do the work for free, which defeats the point of an open-source encyclopedia.

So since I have my own private keys, I could, after the fork, spend an equivalent amount of both BTC and B2X to any given recipient (an exchange, a merchant, etc)? I'm guessing I could tell, for example, Coinbase, that I'm transferring both BTC and B2X from the same wallet and the transactions would both be verified on their separate forks. 
What I'm trying to get at is that there is no harm in me simply holding the BTC on my own private keys during the fork and I'm not missing out on claiming B2X.

Mine too. Binance looked to me like they were doing a lot of back end consolidating when I was doing arbitrage.

I think the point that he was getting at is that the number of people demanding refunds are few enough that a bad business can afford to throw out refunds; they would rather solicit 5 new orders than argue about a refund on one.
I don't know if that's what's going on or not, but I think that's what he was saying.
