Yes that's called arbitrage. I've done it numerous times with great success. But it will need to be done when the  bitcoin network is not as congested. It can take time to transfer btc from one exchange to another. I usually do it with ethereum but even that cane take some time to transfer.

Sure, any coin can work. As long as it transfers fast enough so you can take advantage of the price difference.

You can actually buy ripple at bitstamp exchange with isd and its usually traded at a cheaper price, but be prepared for the credit card fees

IMO, its the Asian market with the weak hands. I think the Youbit exchange  hack, South Korean government rumours, and North Korean hackers are scaring Asian investors. That why the markets were strong all day, but night time comes, the dip occurs. Just my thoughts....

Its because the price fluctuated so fast that the money you have is now not enough.

It is the 2nd best IMO. It has alot of the top 50 alt coins to trade. When the site is busy, the graphs and prices tend to lag, so alot of browsing refreshing is needed. It just needs credit card support and fiat deposits/withdrawals, then it'd be king.

Fuk, shoulda sold at 14k and bought back in 11! Hindsight is a bitch.

Yeah I've paid the fee countless times just because it was easy, instant, and FOMO. Also, each of my CCs decline the transaction the first time due to it being an international transaction. So make sure you call your CC and let them know.

Eh I mean besides all the Coinbase bullshit that's been going on, it's hard to beat GDAX. Their UI is the smoothest and fastest.

So I ahead and sold at $13331 and bought back in at $13130 = $400  profit in btc. Ehhh at least its something.

There is also Bitstamp. You can use CC to buy BTC and other alts. The con is they charge 5% fee and they charge it as a "Cash Advance". The issue with that is most credit card companies charge a fee for cash advances. 
Citibank - "either $10 or 5% of the amount of each cash advance, whichever is greater."
CapitalOne - "Either 4% of the amount of each advance or $20 minimum, whichever is greater "

Sure but the problem with litecoin, is that's its not a commonly traded pair with other alt coins.

Dude, it's just money! Especially in this case, it's digital money! Who cares if you lose it all, it doesn't define you.
Step outside, take a breath of fresh air and look at the stars. Imagine how lucky you are as a sentient being to be alive on this planet and see the beauty of it everyday. The planets aligned perfectly with our star to give you life, think about how rare that is. Sorry for being all astrological on this shit, but it's true.
