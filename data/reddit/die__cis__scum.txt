It's a choice, retard. Learn to Gentoo.

You're using the wrong point of view.
The user of the patch here is the node operator. The node operator considers some transactions, thinks they're malware, and doesn't want to relay them. Preventing him from using the patch is slavery. And remember, node operators are doing all this for free.

I know you ;). You're also a bitcoin overlay contributor. So what are you doing here, the hall of dumb &amp; dumber?

How about a config file? And then you can distribute a suggested list.
I run a few nodes and I would be interested by blocking CBHS and crap like Mastercoin/Counterparty/etc. I didn't know it was easily possible.

You did not understand his reply. Chrome OS is using portage but not Gentoo's ebuilds.
And here come the clueless voters who don't get it either.

Please never manage a computer besides your own. Also, Gentoo, binaries? Caught talking out of your ass!

Keep thinking you're "boycotting" Gentoo. Not that you could ever install it. And you're the troll here, spouting baseless accusations at things you do not understand.

You said "Make it a choice.". It always was. Don't try to act like you understood. You did not. But you still had to write your uninformed opinion.
I wish there was a way to ban redditards from Bitcoin, I would certainly enable it.

Thanks. I'm still running the older versions because the new ones require an unstable dev-libs/boost. But I'm an actual Gentoo user (10 years) and node runner (3 years) unlike 99% of people here. I've always wanted to experiment with which transactions I would relay.

Since when all nodes should be running the same code? That never has been the case and will increasingly not be the case.
You don't understand Gentoo, Bitcoin, protocols, and probably computers.

Default means that there's a choice to be made. Which you did not understand. Stop trying to save face, you're a retard and now everyone knows it.

subscribers couldn't install Gentoo if their life depended on it.
Prove me wrong instead of downvoting me.

As a Gentoo user I'm also disgusted by all the pitchforks from people who have no clue about it. And amused by "boycotts" from cowards who couldn't install it anyway. Proof:
