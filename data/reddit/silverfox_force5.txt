I have a trezor and a ledger and prefer the trezor personally better because of the interface but ledger is physically nicer
@_date: 2019-07-26 12:33:27
I bought a trezor from them and everything went through just fine with no issues
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:10:00
I just tried and it said you didn’t have enough “inbound capacity” not sure what it means but wouldn’t let me send
@_date: 2019-07-25 20:16:24
Dude this isn’t smart anybody who can do math would know you have 3 bitcoins and even worse that you’re keeping them on coinbase and even worse leaves you vulnerable to a sim attack and even worse lose all your money

Everyone talking about the new wealthy elite, we will simply be joining the ranks at best. The wealthy of today will still be the wealthy of tomoorw. Say millionaires and billionaires don’t start buying bitcoin and realizing its potential as the future world currency until it hits a million. Guess how many million dollar bitcoin you can buy with a billion dollars?guess how many million dollar bitcoin you can buy with ten million? Most likely more then most of us btc subreddit

Yep got the trezor one and the nano s just like trezor interface when you hook it to a computer it’s neatly organized shows  graphs and prices and even links to a bunch of exchanges so you can trade cryptos without having to move from your trezor although the prices are a little high

So how did you know they accepted SPEDN payments? Did they advertise in the store or is it a certain type of pos that can automatically accept SPEDN lightning payments? We’re they even aware that they could accept btc at this place?

Not my seed phrase but my 24 word key. I actually had 2 ledgers and it was the same for both of them
@_date: 2019-11-05 19:21:28
No way one person did it. He’d have to have put in at least 150 billion dollars and not to mention other crypto’s that shot up 5-10-20x did he pump  bch,ltc,eth etc as well?

It’s more of an explanation of internet 3.0 and how it will be decentralized and how these companies like Facebook and amazon that steal your privacy won’t exist on Web 3.0 I think it’s a great theory
@_date: 2019-11-17 00:40:38
Does this explanation mean that the next halving won’t be as significant or it will be just as significant?
@_date: 2019-11-17 01:50:43
Is this real life?
@_date: 2019-11-03 00:24:03
I mean if you’re really that stupid I don’t think there is much you can do, sorry bud

thanks for the chance this is very cool and generous

Particl and others are working on things like this

Even with free electricity it would probably take you years to make your money back on your hardware investment.. mining is loud and not ideal if you’re renting a room.best bet is to just buy a small amount and from there you’ll be get it . It seems like most people tend to mull over the idea and watch it before they make the jump into buying (I certainly did) just take the jump and go down the rabbit hole you’ll start googling bitcoin and checking the price way too much and and eventually lead to the understanding of what money really is and ultimately you get to go to bed terrified every night knowing what the economies of the world are really built on. bitcoin is pretty awesome
@_date: 2019-11-23 20:38:40
That’s what I thought, I didn’t understand why but It was my devices (both times) that asked me to put the seed phrase into the device. Was a small pain in the ass but fortunately I was able to access my funds and just moved everything to my trezors
@_date: 2019-11-14 07:33:10
I’m pretty sure you can’t mine bitcoin from a phone so anything that says it can is probably just a scam. My friends been bugging me to mine “pi coin” supposedly it’s a coin you can mine from your phone but it’s not listed or worth anything but apparently theres a bunch of people who are mining it with the hopes it may be worth something someday
@_date: 2019-11-24 03:19:51
For all the dorks who take things way to literally obviously I didn’t mean “reinstall my keys” but I did have to punch in my private key into the device which was a lot less inconvenient compared to the trezor
@_date: 2019-11-17 01:29:45
Great explanation many thanks for taking the tome to wright that
@_date: 2019-11-27 23:14:53
Based on your grammar I definitely think you are stupid
@_date: 2019-11-17 02:17:07
You got skills brother if bitcoin doesn’t make you wealthy I’m sure you’re gd skills will lol nice job
@_date: 2019-11-01 08:27:49
Don’t buy from robinhood  they don’t ever give you actual btc that you can transfer to storage more of just an iou. Use cashapp or anywhere else that will let you control your own key and send and receive bitcoin
@_date: 2019-11-30 01:32:03
Great app and great of you to do this. what a generous community this is, all this sharing makes me want to do a giveaway
@_date: 2019-11-13 06:41:56
Well at least you didn’t get downvoted over 11k times so I guess that’s a win for btc ��‍♂️
@_date: 2019-11-20 08:17:34
Haha some real libertarian shit right here
@_date: 2019-11-20 21:55:27
I wish but No way this is real
@_date: 2019-11-07 05:09:34
Pretty sure this is a known scam I see this complaint every week on here. Never supposed to buy btc with PayPal sorry bud
@_date: 2019-11-14 04:57:25

Thanks I didn’t realize it was a public data base. I read on a different page that veggie galaxy only accepts btc on weekdays which doesn’t make any sense but I’ll be sure to update the info on coinmaps
@_date: 2019-06-16 08:24:49
No but I think there is something called screenshot

I believe that it’s legal to use and hold crypto in China but exchanges can’t sell it

sucks having stellar last. I took most of my coins out of alts but kept all my stellar for the reason I made most of my gains with it in 2017 and built a sentimental attachment. I bought at a penny and went to 85 cents legit. 85xed my investment that year but this year it hasn’t even 2xed
@_date: 2019-06-20 00:20:25
Sure it does it should direct you right to myetherwallet and keep your keys private and secure
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:05:12
I’ve made plenty of purchases on coinbase over the years and it usually takes about ten days but I made my first buy in over a year on May 28 and it’s still not letting me transfer my funds for some reason. Keeps saying to wait for my bank transfer to clear. I had the funds in my account instantly but still not able to send it almost 30 days later
@_date: 2019-06-01 20:22:48
I read this artcile saying institutional wallets are holding between 1000-12000 btc

You may be right, the sun is clearly setting behind them yet the shadows look like the sun would be in front of them. If there would even be a shadow with that little amount of clouded sunlight

@_date: 2019-12-07 00:30:49
You can’t. There is no private key for your coinbase wallet. They control the private key. You need to create your own wallet then send the btc from your cb wallet to the wallet that you control the keys to
@_date: 2019-12-27 16:31:15
It’s actually been about five years since I’ve seen a dentist as well and my teeth are all straight and still there but my front teeth are starting to get a nasty buildup on them and I know I have cavities in a bunch of teeth not to mention one in the back that’s completely rotting out and also my gums are probably in pretty rough shape so I know it’s hard to tell by that description. you were very lucky to not go for five years and have zero cavities. I think genetics play a lot into it as well.

Every day there’s a post on here that begins with “ I got a private message on discord yada yada yada free bitcoin”. Sounds like discord is scam city...also what is this discord I’m hearing about everyday?

looks like it’s an ethereum/erc20 wallet

Big blocks do work fine (for now) but not so fine in the grand scheme of global spending with millions of transactions a day which I don’t think lightning at this point is yet too either. but I’m hopeful that they’ll figure things out. Realistically 2 years isn’t that long when you look at the time it takes for most anyone or anything to cultivate from an idea to a finished product

Yikes two left feet, love the commitment but you should have waited until btc went up a little more and spent a  more money on your work. Good tattoos aren’t cheap and cheap tattoos aren’t good
@_date: 2019-12-08 23:53:49
Seems like you already figured it out. Like you said you never entered and why would anyone just give away free money. I certainly wouldn’t give them 75 bucks

Let the paper deal with it lol that’s silly but I like that you’re the kind of person who can do something like that you’re a sweety pie
@_date: 2019-12-09 07:58:57
I’ll second this but the fees seem a bit high. And yes you get control of your own keys
@_date: 2019-12-29 00:00:25
Nice, what store is this or what part of Boston is it located?
@_date: 2019-12-25 23:01:02
Where did you buy it?
@_date: 2019-12-23 06:25:52
I wonder if it has to do with the huge population of illegal Mexicans in LA.the best way to send money back to Mexico

You can’t put a price on your mouth bud. I’m a very confident and secure person generally but I’ve become very insecure about my teeth and not wanting to smile and talk close to people is really starting to hold me back. So it took you a couple years to fully finish? I’m a bit of a dentistphobe which is why I’ve gotten to this point. Ultimately I’d love to find someone to knock out the work over the course of a week or two
@_date: 2019-12-25 23:00:33
Sounds like you should have done some more research. There’s no usernames in bitcoin
@_date: 2019-12-28 19:23:24
Nothing like that at all man just trying to give back a little
@_date: 2019-12-13 07:35:38
A few months back some dude on here was bragging that he had 6.15 bitcoin or something. It’s became the joke of reddit for a couple days
@_date: 2019-12-28 19:59:06
Agreed bro but this is the 1% it’s not a scam. I spend a good hour a day reading articles on here and grateful for the community band just trying to give back

@_date: 2019-12-07 00:31:57
Also Your seed phrase is your private key
@_date: 2019-12-06 05:55:49
It’s a scam man. Anytime someone asks you to send bitcoin to get bitcoin it’s a scam. They make their money by people like you who send the 0.01 bitcoin. Nothing is ever free why would anyone reach out to a random stranger. Be smarter then that this is the biggest scam in the history of bitcoin
@_date: 2019-12-30 04:08:26
I’ll give you 7400 and fly out to Oregon to pick it up
@_date: 2019-12-06 05:58:14
It may look like you have 3 btc in your account but unless you have the private keys you can’t withdraw them. The scammer has the key to that wallet so he’s never at risk of losing any btc
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:21:34
This is just what I was looking for I ran a few test orders through to see what kind of savings I could get and was super impressed with this. Gonna pull the trigger tonight when I get home thanks
