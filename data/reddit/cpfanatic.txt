He probably really meant "donate".

A different style of censoring.

Proof that Ethereum could not have been built without tokens. Perhaps not even with tokens the way things have been looking...
Tokens were definitely an integral part of Ethereum's "blockchain" &lt;cough&gt; when it came to selling them to raise all that money!

I also noticed that the app refers to "gems" rather than 'XGEM'. Is that going to confuse the new users?
@_date: 2014-11-30 20:21:01
Is there another video showing how that user goes from zero GEMS to having earned GEMS?

The only thing you could have done to make this better is...
never-mind, it couldn't be better!
I loved the special effects that the sound-man contributed.

How could they possibly know that they were the first to do this? I know of other original music that has had its hash stored on the blockchain in 2014. When are they asserting that they actually began employing this practice?

I love the smell of marmots in the morning. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 15:44:38
I see marmots in there. You have to look very closely.

Have you considered the tag Guru?

Do you really have a hard time understanding the claim, or are you just the community manager for Factom?
@_date: 2015-08-17 05:30:53
So the big fanfare by the whole Factom team about how awesome this was should be disregarded? 
When the actual details are questioned we all get a version of 'well, that depends on what the definition of what is is'.

For starters, he doesn't know what the business case is. He certainly doesn't have a grasp on basic economics. It's clear that in the ten minutes or so of watching the guy interview him, the interviewer has a better handle on Peter's problems than Peter does (and that interviewer is just two-bit dudebro).

His name is "PICKLES" damn it!

"agreed" means an agreement - full stop.
"signed a contract" is no different. 
A verbal agreement is a contract as is a contract that is signed on paper. You (Factom) stated that there was an "agreement" and that is what was reported on by many 'media outlets' and trumpeted by your team as 'big news'!
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:26:31
The video is self-evident but since you're in-the-tank with Factom (being the "Community Manager") it's probably difficult for you to see.

It means about 328 different things.
Which one are you most interested in?
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:19:53
That was one of the funniest parts!

It looks like the traditional bank attire is starting to change. What is it say on that hat?

As Andreas says:  "Bitcoin is not smooth jazz. Bitcoin is punk rock."

He should know the "minute details" of his company's tech and economics! It was *not* a trick question that required almost a week and an entire team to create a 'pivot' response to his own interview!
@_date: 2015-04-04 00:44:18
It seems to me that this post would benefit Bitcoin and the people trying to get some visibility more than the OP.
It would be nice to see it get the attention it deserves.

I was doing SEO before anyone coined the term "SEO". I have read all the SEO 'Pearls of Wisdom' ad nauseam.
Much of the content is usually bullshit to benefit the self-serving purposes of the writer of the article.
I have rarely seen anyone provide the true 'chicken recipe' so clearly with no agenda and no interest in self promotional purpose. I am very impressed by this (for real).
Knowing what I know about this topic since the mid 1990's I know how on the money this advice is. I'm truly impressed and amazed at Josh's willingness to share this without any interest in profiting from it.
There are going to be hoards of SEO 'gurus' that will be freaking out as they read this being given away for no charge while they charge clients up-the-ass.
Josh has just blown up the SEO space kinda like Snowden blew up other secrets. I do know that what he shared are not exactly total 'secrets' that have never been addressed but no other "SEO" guys would be willing to be this frank.
Thanks Josh!

Do you mean all women who like Bitcoin or do you just mean that private club who call themselves the "Women of Bitcoin"?

It took no time – he already knew.
