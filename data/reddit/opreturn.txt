Yet I'm still waiting for them to approve my podcast. I have a feeling they are doing this on purpose. They want bitcoin to die, what better way, than to fill up the store with apps that steal coins.

thanks for going through my history. 
Yes! actually. I use Udemy. a couple of them. Not to become a programer, but network engineering these days are not like the old days. You need some basic programming knowledge. Software Defined Networking. So, yes, it's no longer enough to learn OSPF, STP, BGP, IPSec/VPN, HSRP, Load-balancing, Firewalling etc. You need to automate your work using python or ruby.

1. attach nano 
2. open the chrome extension (ethereum or BTC)
3. pick your chain (example: bitcoin, (not BCASH) then Segwit.
4. you'll come to a window that shows your balance 0.0
5. click receive! 
6. it will show you an address that starts with 3. (example: 3dKDldkalkalljlKJDLKJDLKJDLDKJLD)
7. Copy that shit. 
8. go to coinbase. (never used coin base so i don't know but send your bitcoin to that address) 
done!

Coinbase aka block reward will be sufficient enough to pay for miners for at least another 10, 20 years. I'm old enough to remember where miners were "barely scraping by" with 900 dollar btc price, just a year ago, and for some reason they are still barely scraping by at 10K.  Hmmmmm i wonder what's going on.  By the time we need to only rely on fees btc price will be high enough to make sure miners barely scrape by. ��

The.  Most. Secure. Chain. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:14:28
A bar of gold. A disk of iron. A chain of beads. A card of plastic. A slip of cotton-linen paper. These things are worthless. One cannot eat them, or drink them, or use them as a blanket. But they are valuable, too. Their value comes from the simplest thing. People believe they are money, and so they are.
If every currency is a consensual delusion, then bitcoin, a digital cryptocurrency that changes hands over the internet, feels more like a consensual hallucination on psychedelic drugs. The concept of bitcoin was born in a detailed white paper published in late 2008 by a pseudonymous “Satoshi Nakamoto.” By 2013, one bitcoin was worth $12. As of this writing, it’s worth more than $10,000. Its value has doubled in the last two months alone. For any currency’s value to increase by 100 percent in eight weeks is, to use a technical term, bonkers. If the Japanese yen or American dollar did the same, their economies would plunge into an infernal deflationary spiral.
Throughout history, currency has taken one of two forms: physical assets, like gold or beads, and fiat currency, like government-backed paper and coins. Bitcoin and its brethren introduce a third category: digital currencies that run on a combination of game theory, economics, and cryptography—thus, cryptocurrencies. If all money is the sharing of an illusion, bitcoin wants to build a better way to share it.
Like many people, I’ve long regarded bitcoin’s rise with both wonder and confusion.  To help me make sense of it, I started calling cryptocurrency experts and academics to ask, is bitcoin just a dumb bubble, like 17th-century tulip bulbs? An investment hedge, like gold? A currency, like dollars? The answers I got weren’t satisfyingly unanimous. I heard “all of the above” and “none of the above” and “nobody knows for sure, yet.”
Toward a More Perfect Money
What’s wrong with dollars, anyway? If you ask me, very little. I like my credit card. I don’t even mind cash.
But to others, the dollar’s dangers are glaringly obvious: a single omnipotent entity, the federal government, strictly controlling money supply and the rules that govern it. Some worry that the creation of too many dollars will lead to out-of-control inflation. “Cypherpunks have dreamed of fully decentralized electronic payment systems for decades” that would allay these concerns, writes Timothy Lee, a senior tech-policy reporter at Ars Technica who has long been on the bitcoin beat. Most digital-currency ideas, however, had the same tragic flaw—replicability. Just about everything that exists online (think text, photos, or files) can be copied. Fear of rampant counterfeiting would spell death for a digital currency.
Bitcoin solved this problem with the blockchain, an online ledger that records and validates all peer-to-peer payments to eliminate double-spending. For those inclined to less-than-legal behavior, it helps that the blockchain encrypts transactions to provide anonymity. The payment network is maintained by bitcoin “miners,” a decentralized group of individuals with powerful computers that approve transactions and are rewarded with new bitcoins for their work. The total possible supply of bitcoin in the world is capped. Thus, bitcoin solves both of the cryptopunk money problems—the blockchain thwarts centralization, and the planned scarcity of bitcoins checks inflation.

I watched 4 seconds of the video and i knew what that retard was trying to say, and he is wrong!
let me explain it to you;
You don't own any coins! there are no coins! What exists, is a mathematical puzzle that you have to solve using your private key (your wallet does that) in order for you to unlock them and send them to another person (key)
These unsolved mathematical puzzles are in a data set called the UTXO "unspent transaction outputs". the people who can solve these unlocked puzzles are the "owners of bitcoin"
good so far?
with lightning it's still the same thing, except the puzzle change. now it includes a multisig between you and the lightning node, with a time lock that releases the funds back to YOU if your partner (lightning node) doesn't play ball! so, it doesn't matter if your coins are locked up in a UTXO, or a multisig, at the end of the day, you have control over them. Don't fall for their bullshit! BCASH is fucking retarded. to have thousands of transactions per seconds you need gig blocks. at that point you're back to paypal and visa and we really didn't change anything. Maybe that's their plan all along. how is that for a conspiracy.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:14:39
The blockchain is an ingenious and potentially transformative technology. People like Marc Andreessen, the well-known venture capitalist, have predicted that it could become the scaffolding of the entire economy, like the internet. Here’s a taste of the transformative vision from an interview Andreessen held with The Washington Post:
Digital stocks. Digital equities. Digital fundraising for companies. Digital bonds. Digital contracts, digital keys, digital title, who owns what—digital title to your house, to your car … You’ve got digital voting, digital contracts, digital signatures … And then every aspect of financial services: insurance contracts, insurance derivatives, currency exchange, remittance—on and on and on.
Nobody knows for sure whether the blockchain will transform the economy of the future, as Andreessen foresees. What’s clearer, however, is that it has not transformed the economy of today. While the number of bitcoin transactions is growing every year, it’s nothing close to a mass-market consumer technology, like Google, or Netflix, or even PayPal. Bitcoin remains cumbersome to use (the typical transaction can take up to 10 minutes) and the price is extremely volatile. It is, for now, a frankly terrible currency built on top of a potential transformative technology.
Which leads to perhaps the most obvious question: If bitcoin appears to have flopped as a mass-market currency, why has it so suddenly succeeded as an investment vehicle?
Up, Up, and Away
There are countless theories about why bitcoin’s valuation has gone berserk. But for the purpose of time and sanity, let’s reduce them to four mega-arguments.
1. Venture capital (and a green light from the feds) got the ball rolling.
For the first five years of bitcoin’s existence, venture capital’s interest in bitcoin-related products and companies was minimal. After all, the very idea of cryptocurrency was infamous for its association with online black markets like Silk Road, where criminals used digital tokens to anonymously sell drugs and other illegal stuff. (In fact, one could argue that bitcoin’s rising valuation is just a bet that its most dubious uses—say, avoiding taxes or laundering money—will keep rising.) It seemed for a while that the U.S. government might try to crush the ostensible competitor of the almighty dollar.
But in November 2013, shortly after the FBI shut down Silk Road, several senators praised bitcoin and other virtual currencies at an official hearing as “legitimate financial services.” Senatorial droning on C-SPAN doesn’t always move markets. But when it does, it really does. The value of bitcoin tripled within the month to $900, and venture capital got its green light. VC investments in bitcoin rose from nearly nothing in 2012 to $400 million in 2014 and $600 million in 2016. Bitcoin didn’t yet have an obvious mainstream purpose. But it had something even more valuable: legitimacy from Washington, with curiosity and cash from Silicon Valley.
2. It’s digital gold.
People have long described bitcoin as digital gold. In early November, Bloomberg reported that “buy bitcoin” had overtaken “buy gold” as an online search phrase, suggesting that bitcoin’s rising valuation could be partly due to investors seeing it as the precious metal’s trendy equivalent. Like gold or silver, bitcoin is scarce (by design) and a popular hedge for inflation hawks, worrywarts, conspiracy theorists, and other antiestablishment investors who believe the global economy is always a month away from implosion or hyperinflation.
There is another important way that bitcoin is like gold: Its reputation is much bigger than its market. In any given week, $34 billion in bitcoin is traded, according to The Wall Street Journal, less than 1 percent of the global foreign-exchange market.
As New York University professor and so-called “dean of valuation” Aswath Damodaran quipped, bitcoin could become the world’s reserve cryptocurrency or the biggest bust of the century. “Right now it’s not a very good currency, because it’s not a good medium of exchange and it’s not a good store of value, because it’s too volatile,” he told CNBC. He offered a more probable outcome for bitcoin: “gold for Millennials.”
3. It’s the reserve currency of the ICO market.
What’s an ICO? An “initial coin offering” is essentially a way for a company to crowdsource funds without selling shares. Instead of accepting public money in exchange for equity, as in an initial public offering, or IPO, an ICO offers digital tokens denominated in a new cryptocurrency.
The conventional wisdom on ICOs is somewhat split. Some see it as an ingenious way for founders to quickly raise money without relying on the gatekeepers of venture capital. Others point out that it’s easy way to con poor dolts looking to buy into the crypto frenzy. And what a frenzy it is: In 2017, the ICO market exploded, raising more than $2 billion for new companies.
There are several ways that the ICO craze feeds, and is fed by, the bitcoin boom. First, some analysts believe that the most lucrative ICOs are driven, not only by gullible rubes, but also by bitcoin millionaires who want to diversify their investments without paying tax by cashing out of cryptocurrencies, which would trigger a capital-gains tax. ICOs fulfill that need.
Second, many ICO investors first convert their cash into bitcoin before buying tokens in a new cryptocurrency. As Tim Lee argues, this makes bitcoin the “reserve currency” of the crypto economy. Just as the U.S. dollar benefits from its status as the world’s reserve currency, accepted worldwide in lieu of or in exchange for the local currency, the same is often true of bitcoin in cryptocurrency markets. It’s possible that these factors work together in a feedback loop, where bitcoin millionaires seeking diversification raise the profile of ICOs, which increase the value of bitcoin.
This much is clear: Bitcoin’s valuation has gone nuts in tandem with the (perhaps equally nuts) boomlet in ICOs.
4. Maybe it’s just this simple: Bitcoin is an unprecedentedly dumb bubble built on ludicrous speculation.
It seems strange to call a currency a bubble. But lacking more specific terminology, bubble seems like the only word that would apply.
Even if one buys the argument that blockchain is brilliant, cryptocurrency is the new gold, and bitcoin is the reserve currency of the ICO market, it is still beyond strange to see any product’s value double in six weeks without any material change in its underlying success or application. Instead, there has been a great and widening divergence between bitcoin’s transaction volume (which has grown 32 times since 2012) and its market price (which had grown more than 1,000 times).
Surveys show that the vast majority of bitcoin owners are buying and holding bitcoin to exchange them for dollars. Let’s be clear: If the predominant use case for any asset is to buy it, wait for it to appreciate, and then to exchange it for dollars, it is a terrible currency. That is how people treat baseball cards or stamps, not money. For most of its owners, bitcoin is not a currency. It is a collectible—a digital baseball card, without the faces or stats.
* * *
The explosion of bitcoin’s value has been pretty silly. But great things can be born of such silliness.
As Dan Gross wrote in his book Pop!, the soapsuds of burst bubbles often fertilize the next generation’s breakthrough technologies. Before the national telegraph, train system, and tech giants, there was a telegraph bubble, a train bubble, and (who could forget?) a dot-com and online-retail bubble. The blockchain, like each of those technologies, has the potential to become a critical piece of infrastructure for the digital economy, even if the price of bitcoin is crashing as you read this paragraph.
In my most illuminating conversation about bitcoin, I spoke with Christian Catalini, a professor of technology at MIT Sloan School of Management. He began by reciting the three classic purposes of money: unit of account (you can measure income in dollars), store of value (you can hold dollars in your wallet and they won’t “go bad”), and medium of exchange (give somebody dollars and they’ll trust the value). Would bitcoin meet all three criteria? Maybe, he said. But maybe it won’t—and it won’t matter.
“You could imagine that in the future there might be a cryptocurrency that is mostly a store of value, like gold,” he said. “It would be decentralized, and robust, but with high transaction fees. I might use it to buy a house, but not a coffee. On the other hand, others might be more useful for smaller payments. With digital tech, maybe we can have many different kinds of currencies, which altogether unbundle store of value from medium of exchange.”
What seems most certain is that the future of money will test our conventional definitions—of currencies, of bubbles, and of initial offerings. What’s happening this month with bitcoin feels like an unsustainable paroxysm. But it’s foolish to try to develop rational models for when such a market will correct itself. Prices, like currencies, are collective illusions. And the history of American bubbles suggests that national hallucinations, like the over-construction of the rail system in the 19th century, can undergird the very real transformations of the next generation, even after they go pop.

so, the difference between gold and bitcoin is that the real bitcoins (not contracts based on cash) are easily transferable. So, when more and more companies accept bitcoin they take bitcoin. Not CME options. This is something gold didn't have.  Lets see if the CME and "tame" the honey badger.

Screencap this! Soon (3 to 5 years) you'll have countries who will dish out, passports and citizenship for people who are willing to pay like .25 btc fee and can prove they have over one btc. (or something like that) 
This will be a reverse brain drain and you'll see a digital curtain instead of an iron curtain.   Countries who are hostile to crytpo will probably become major shit holes with citizens in a never ending debt, while the other side prospers.

1.yes, i used localbitcoins a while ago. It's like buying a phone from someone on Craig list. Make sure it's during the day, in a public place, not a lont of cash, etc. just be smart and use common sense. Don't meet someone with 5k in cash in at 9pm in a parking lot! 
2. hardware wallets or paper wallets if you wanna store them long term. if you need to use it and spend it then put some one a phone wallet but it's not safe at all. Best one for me was Mycelium. 
3. Gemeni, GDAX, Poloneix, Kraken. these are some well known and popular exchanges. the first two are the most "legit" since they have all the proper licenses. Kraken might also. 
4. each exchange is different slightly. So, tell the person you're meeting that you're want to use GDAX  or whatever for price, and they will charge min 5% for meeting you and shit. So, localbitcoins also comes with a fee. that person has to take risk to come meet a total stranger also. 
5. coins i like beside bitcoin: ether, litecoin, vertcoin, and some erc 20 tokens but that might be a little advance.
things to avoid : BCASH (bitcoin trash, i mean cash), BitConnect, Dash (not as bad as the first two) 
cheers.

thats the next stage. stage one is "store of value"
after some point (2 mill a coin say) it won't fluctuate as much and you can use it as a medium of exchange. There are stages to anything in life.  from a Plant, to a baby, to development of automobiles. All in due time. We are in phase one. phase one ends, when everyone and their mom knows what bitcoin is, and all the old people have died off.  then phase two starts where you an buy coffee with 22 satoshis using Lightning.  You don't pop out of a vag with a laptop and a tie.

@_date: 2017-12-01 06:07:39
I watched 4 seconds of the video and i knew what that retard was trying to say, and he is wrong! 
let me explain it to you;   
You don't own any coins! there are no coins! What exists, is a mathematical puzzle that you have to solve using your private key (your wallet does that) in order for you to unlock them and send them to another person (key)
These unsolved mathematical puzzles are in a data set called the UTXO "unspent transaction outputs". the people who can solve these unlocked puzzles are the "owners of bitcoin" 
good so far?
with lightning it's still the same thing, except the puzzle change. now it includes a multisig between you and the lightning node, with a time lock that releases the funds back to YOU if your partner (lightning node) doesn't play ball!   so, it doesn't matter if your coins are locked up in a UTXO, or a multisig, at the end of the day, you have control over them.  Don't fall for their bullshit! BCASH is fucking retarded. to have thousands of transactions per seconds you need gig blocks. at that point you're back to paypal and visa and we really didn't change anything. Maybe that's their plan all along. how is that for a conspiracy.

its the the first immutable database ever invented by man kind. I mean, data goes in, and after about an hour, nobody on god's green earth can change it. even if jesus and muhamed came down together couldn't change the data. thats a blockchain backed by Proof of work, and a powerful proof of work like bitcoin.(the most actually) 
any other database someone that has root access can change data
Oh, did I mention it has been running 24 x 7 x 365 x 10 with 99.99999999999% up time and no one is in charge!

no, im not. 


you're the greater fool. an immutable database with 99.999999% up time, for the entire planet is something VERY tangible even though you're retarded and think something is tangible only if you can lick it. 


correct! what do you know, you got something right. 


typical tuliptard. 


a centralized blockchain is a contradiction in term. the purpose of a blockchain is to increase decentralization and you can only do that with an intrinsic token than rewards miners for securing the "blockchain" with proof of work.  a centralized blockchain is a horseless carriage with a horse and we already have those. 
Blockchain is just one component, of a set of technologies that work in conjunction to achieve one thing and one thing only, decentralization. that is the measure of success. thats where all the interesting characteristics emerge from!   WTF are you going to do with a centralized blockchain! all you have is a slow database with some hashes and again, we already have those.

Did you ever think about the fact that the CEO of blockstream is a well known cypherpunk who was sited both on the tor and the bitcoin whitepaper and he is the inventor of Proof of work, and they wanna work for him because it's like working for your fucking hero?

its the only secure immutable database ever invented by man kind.  I mean, data goes in, and after about an hour, nobody on god's green earth can change it.  even if jesus and muhamed came down together couldn't change the data. thats a blockchain backed by Proof of work, and a powerful proof of work like bitcoin.  
any other database someone  that has root access can change it. 
Oh, did I mention it has been running 24 x 7 x 365 x 10 with 99.99999999999% up time and no one is in charge!

They have nothing to do with each other. 


the energy that goes into bitcoin is to secure the database called blockchain. That means if you wanna change something in the past, you'll have to do the "work" (energy) all over again, from that point on, all the way to current block. which becomes impossible by the laws of thermodynamics. the energy consumption is there for a reason and that reason if the most crucial part of this equation. 
as far as transactions per seconds, just wait for the Lightning Network.  thanks!

stay in the shower.
When I found out about bitcoin in 2013, it was about to hit 1200$. by the time i figured out how to buy some, MT gox had collapsed and I got my first btc at 800. then i got some at 700. Then i got some more at 500. I even got some at 400. Never sold any.  I hodld.  The technology is what sucked me in, and that's because I had just learned about crypto via Cicada. I fucking HODLd. Guess what, it went to 20k! it was fun!!! didn't sell a single satoshi. Didn't buy any either. now we are 7k. Havn't sold a satoshi.   It will hit 35K, and then 200k! and guess what, i will not sell a single sat! then idiots will call me lucky because I got some bitcoin.   yes! I'm lucky! sure, what ever makes you sleep at night. It's not the fact that I read andreas' book which explains how bitcoin works down to the stack! It's not because I read books explaining the corrupt system of fractional reserve banking we live under which made me appreciate bitcoin. Nope. it was allll luck! I was just walking down the street, and bitcoin just hit me in the head and fell in my pocket! I can't believe i'm so lucky.

Imagine Lightning Hubs, not as companies but more like routers. When you from your machine at home go to a reddit server, you're going through multiple "hops" or routers and eventually you'll end up at your destination. LN hubs acts as routers and transfer value from Alice to Bob. keep in mind there are multiple routes and BGP, the routing protocol of the internet determines which is the best route. If one of the hops dies or blocks traffic, then BGP finds a way around it. thats how the internet works. 
Right now coins "belong to Alice" because Alice control a set of key pairs, and the private key allows you to spend UTXOs from that key pair, to another public address which locks it to another key-pair that is controlled by Bob. 
With LN, Alice controls 1 key, with Charlie, out of a 2 of 2 multi-sig with a time to live of say 1 week at which time the money is sent back to Alice. Charlie can't spend the money by himself. Alice can generate a transaction for full back to herself if she wants to money back and Charlie will sign the send sig needed. If Charlie is a cunt, then he won't and the money will be sent back to Alice after a week and Alice gets to bitch about it on twitter. Charlie's reputation goes down as Charlie is actually a company not really a person. But if Charlie is cool Scro, then if Alice wants to pay bob, in micro payments or whatever, then things go as smoothly as possible. Alice generates a tranny for 0.001 btc and signs it and through the magic of nLOCKTIME and Hash Time Lock Contracts and Bob will receive his message after it went through Chuck, Craig and Danny boy for a very small fee. 
You see, it's still your bitcoin. If it's held up in a 2 of 2 with an NLOCKTIME multi sig or it's held up in a 1 of 1 key-pair address. I know it's difficult for people to wrap their heads around this concept.

reasonable for everyday use? No. Do i need it right now for everyday use? no. Do I want to spend digital gold to buy coffee right now? no. 


I think bitcoin should be a currency for everyday use, but thats not more important that its decentralization characteristics.  Just wait and Lightning until Network will be ready soon and you can use it for everyday transactions.  Learn to have patience. You don't need to use bitcoin right now to buy bubblegum.  
Let me ask you this? Do you think every transaction should be in the blockchain? Do you want thousands of nodes across the world to keep the record of all the veiny dildos you bought from lover's package for the rest of time?  is that scaleable with 2MB? 4MB? 20MB? 1GB? 1 TB? How big should blocks be if you want every transaction to be on-chain? explain to me how that's scaleable.

If a miner is spamming the network *cough bitmain cough... * then the fees go up. Lets say they mine 30% of the blocks. They don't pay mining fee to themselves for the blocks they solve themselves. The fees they pay for the blocks they didn't mine, they make up by raising the transaction fees altogether. They outsource the cost to the average bitcoin user  while they can cry faul and whaaaa whaaaa MUH FEESSS&gt;&gt;

If I had to imagine these two forces (BTC and ETH) as like comic book/ mythical characters; 
BTC would be a giant, made of a Granite-like material but stronger. Slow moving, but immovable. It will destroy anything that stands in it's path. ETH on the other hand is this shapeless, liquid-like metallic entity, floating and moving fast, as if its teleporting. Nothing can stand in it's path, because it will simply go around it or just teleport through it.

No. Thats called Proof-of-work. You know how you always hear " miners are looking for a special number", and or "they are solving a math puzzle"? well, thats  the number. it's a number that starts with a shit ton of zeros. All block hashes start with a lot of zeros. The miners hash the blocks over and over and over and over while changing the nonce to get new hashes and when the find one after billions and trillions of tries, they have "found a block".

Watch it twice. 
If you wanna to save the environment go tell NFL and NBA and FIFA to stop wasting energy.  Tell Hollywood to stop making movies.  Way too much energy.  I don't watch movies. Not important.

Block Validation time.  Also,  it's not needed.  They are spamming the netowk. Plenty of articles showing proof of spam dust transactions. No reason for a person to send Satoshis back and forth over and over and over.  So,  2mb will be spammed.  4mb will be spammed.  This is not about scalability.  This is about taking control of mining and development.

If you understand that the worlds fiscal policy is absolutely retarded,  and I mean that,  then you know this isn't a bubble.  This is the first sound money since the gold standard.

All these technologies work in conjunction to achieve one goal and that's decentralization. As andreas so well put it, that is the measure of success. These guys are clueless and they want a "blockchain" which is not decentralized, it's not boarder-less,it's not open permission, none of that. They want none of that. Just use a database.

You do understand we have people who are spamming the network right? No reason to send a satoshi back and forth thousands of times. NO FUCKING REASON. MemPool has been under attack for a long time. Forking to 2 MB will not do anything specially when the people who are spamming are miners and they pay the fees to themselves ( at least a lot of it ) This will continue until they take more and more power and we end up with paypal. 
I rather have slow network thats decentralized and no one controls, than to have a fast payment network for Rogers coffee and end up with paypal. Want to buy a coffee use venmo.

Imagine Lightning Hubs, not as companies but more like routers. When you from your machine at home go to a reddit server, you're going through multiple "hops" or routers and eventually you'll end up at your destination. LN hubs acts as routers and transfer value from Alice to Bob. keep in mind there are multiple routes and BGP, the routing protocol of the internet determines which is the best route. If one of the hops dies or blocks traffic, then BGP finds a way around it. thats how the internet works. 
Right now coins "belong to Alice" because Alice control a set of key pairs, and the private key allows Alice to spend UTXOs from that key pair, to another public address which locks it to another key-pair that is controlled by Bob. 
With LN, Alice controls 1 key, with Charlie,  out of a 2 of 2 multi-sig with a time to live of say 1 week at which time the money is sent back to Alice. Charlie can't spend the money by himself. Alice can generate a transaction for full back to herself if she wants the money back and Charlie will sign the second signature needed.  If Charlie is a cunt, then he won't and the money will be sent back to Alice after a week and Alice gets to bitch about it on twitter. Charlie's reputation goes down as Charlie is actually a company not really a person.  But if Charlie is cool Scro, then if Alice wants to pay bob, in micro payments or whatever, then things go as follows. Alice generates a tranny for 0.001 btc and signs it and through the magic of nLOCKTIME and Hash Time Lock Contracts Bob will receive his coins after it went through Chuck, Craig and Danny boy for a very small fee. 
You see, it's still your bitcoin. If it's held up in a 2 of 2 with an NLOCKTIME multi sig or it's held up in a 1 of 1 key-pair address.  I know it's difficult for people to wrap their heads around this concept.

saved!!!! thanks!  I've used a bip39 password also. But it's not just a password. It's a md5 hash of an answer to a riddle that only my close family members know. So, even if someone takes the plates, it will be useless and since it's not a dictionary word or anything like that, it's even harder to brute force. I did have to explain what a md5 is and how to get the value to the people who need to crack it.  it should be a fun game for them :D, I love me a riddle.

Fine, i'll assume you're not a paid shill. 


I'm a network engineer. My expertise is in data center design and implementation. I understand scaling, and I im not worried about increased computation requirements. That comes with growth and development in all disciplines: 
- My android uses more energy than my old nokia 6160 
- cisco 3500 uses a lot more energy than a 4948
- 100mb fiber SFP uses a lot less energy than a 100Gb SFP
- CERN uses a lot more energy than Fermilab 
i can go on and on and on. 
I'm not a an expert in the field of distributed consensus systems, but speaking of "trust views of others. " [lets see what the person who wrote the book on bitcoin has to say about this topic.](  Until I watched his lecture a few times, I still didn't fully grasp how important proof of work actually is. 


You could be 100% right, or not. Too early to tell. The discussion isn't about understanding what PoW or PoS are.
sure, eth can go POS. I'm not against all POS systems. I'm saying, bitcoin will remain on POW for the foreseeable future. 


sorry, if i was rude, but im really getting sick of these same questions and arguments. Please watch that lecture, and let me know if you still think POS is the way to go for "digital gold"

You should have learned about bitcoin earlier. same with me. but we didn't but there was no barrier to entry for any of us except for knowledge unlike now, which requires you to pop out of a specific vagina on a specific patch of dirt. Do you know how many times people told me the shut the fuck up about bitcoin? Enough to the point where i stopped telling people about it after 2 years. But more than i can count. They all told me to go fuck myself, but maybe a handful. Their lack of interest in their own monetary sovereignty is NOT MY PROBLEM.

okay citigroup hahaha


remember when miners were profitable when bitcoin was 300-600 dollars for like 2 fucking years? yea, i do. now it's 7K per coin. They are making money fist over fist.  Also, did you know that new chips are 7 nm. Why is that important?  you and the author have such elementary understanding of all the game theoretical aspects of bitcoin, it's sorry. 


now you have a blockchain that is not immutable, but it's tamper evident. Great. just run hadoop, dedicate a column to hashes and signatures, why do you need a blockchain? but you probably don't know what that is.

i did the same thing. I gave out paper wallets to people i talk to about bitcoin while playing poker, (i used to play poker a lot not any more). basically i had like 3 paper wallets in my wallet at all time. All the PKs were swept in my mycelium wallet. I showed them how i zapped value to paper, so they can see how bitcoin worked. Then i would tell them to make their own wallet, and send these coins to your new wallet. You have 1 month. If you don't i'll take them back. 
70% never touched them and i took them back. I don't do that anymore. Fuck em. let them be laggards.

@_date: 2017-11-09 18:27:41


Wrong! [Altcoins have been around since the early days.](
it has nothing to do with block size! it has to do with poeple copy shit. it has to do with greed. It has to do with people wanting coins, but for cheaper, so they hope their new "altcoin" they buy now is going to take over bitcoin. it's greed.  They are not refusing to compromise! what are we compromising? not going to 20MB block, like how gavin wanted back in 2014? or not enabling segwit and breaking bitmains ASICBoost? WTF are you talking about? 


just shut the fuck up.

As far as the rest of your question my answer is BTC and ETH. I will never EVER sell any of my crypto for fiat. never have, never will. I will either use in 2022 or it's all gone which is fine. I've only put what i could afford to lose. so even though it's a big number, it's house money.

no they are not. They would have to redo the whole architecture. 


The problem with an architectural vulnerability like this is that it is challenging to fix without changing the architecture.
Ledger has employed multiple mitigations to try and prevent an attacker from exploiting this vulnerability.
First of all, the MCU firmware has been optimized and rearranged. Specifically, the firmware calls into functions in the bootloader instead of duplicating the functions. While this prevents this particular mode of attack, it’s important to be aware that there are other, more “creative” methods of attack that I know of, and probably some that I don’t know of.
Secondly, the SE now times the MCU when it asks it to send the flash contents. This is designed to prevent the use of compression algorithms. It is also supposed to prevent code being supplied by the computer over USB. I’m not sure how well it succeeds in doing the latter, due to the fact that the code can be kept in RAM.
However, it’s of note that the SE runs at up to 28 MHz yet the “adversary” (the MCU) runs at up to 80 MHz! This throws into question whether a slower chip can accurately time a faster chip to prevent it from doing extra things, especially given the slow UART communication.
Ledger refused to send me a release candidate, so I haven’t had an opportunity to verify how well these mitigations resolve the issue. But these raise an important question.
Is it truly possible to use a combination of timing and “difficult to compress” firmware to achieve security in this model?
Building secure systems using this model seems like an incredibly exciting research proposition and I think it’s interesting to see companies like Ledger pushing the envelope on this.

@_date: 2017-09-26 19:53:05
let me help you understand. 
It's not a wallet! don't think of it as a wallet. Think of it as a keychain. all bitcoins are tied to a keychain. There is a private key and a public key. So long as you have the private key you can create the public key from it, but not the other way around. Bitcoin addresses come from public keys but they are not public keys but thats not that important. 
bitcoin blockchain is a giant cloud computer that you can access anywhere. Think of it as a giant locker room with trillions and trillions of lockers. Using your private key, you can give owndership of those coins to another person using their PUBLIC address! it's just a giant chain of ownerships. 
now, when you have a web wallet on an exchange, YOU DON"T HAVE THE PRIVATE KEY! THEY DO. so, you can't have those coins on a say a hardware wallet. But if you have the private key (which now you can remember by those 12 or 24 seed words) you can "have control" of those coins on as many Hardware wallets, and software wallets as you want. 
hope that helped.

No. we got rich because we understand the technology, we understand how the current system is more corrupt that you can possibly imagine and we know bitcoin doesn't have to do anything.

I think you're wrong. Lets say some people in Iran decide to make a token that helped the wheat farmers sell their wheat on the ethereum blockchain or whatever. And the "governent" came along and said


do you think the ethereum community overwhelmingly are going to fork? the answer is NO. hell NO.  Ethereum fork was indeed created by the main dev team, but no one had to do anything. People willingly, upgraded (me included) their full node, and the projects, almost all of them, released their tokens on ETH and not ETC.  I don't know if you were around in the ethereum community back then, but i was, and pretty much everyone wanted to fork and the trolls who didn't, well, they got their ETC and look at it. It's dead. no development, it's like 20 bucks, while ETH is pushing 1k... all the activity is on ETH.

Forget that. Think about it this way. If the government only relied on taxation to get things done,  ie (build "roads and bridges") we wouldn't be in a 20 trillion dollar debt situation we are in. So,  the overwhelming majority of the capital used by government comes from printing money out if thin air. And you can't do that with bitcoin.

You don't seem to understand. It's a global thing. You can't do anything legally when it's a global, permission-less, open-source software system.  let me give you an analogy. 
It's as if, you want to protect yourself from a tiger so you decide to threaten it with legal stink.  The tiger doesn't give a shit! You need to protect yourself with something else, maybe a spear.

You could not mine certain transactions make life slower for some people. 
You could doublespend transactions and people would find out and black list your node so it only would work for so long.

Steps: 
1. Community finds out about a looming fork. 
2. A lot of money gets drained from the alt market and dumped into btc. Most people want free money they get from the fork. [I like money!]( Specially whales. 
3. This sharply increases the price of bitcoin and depresses the alt market. It sets a new low support for the BTC price. maybe 10, 15% higher. 
4. Fork happens. Savvy investors/whales are the first to dump their shiny new fake BTC coins. They either buy Alts, or they buy BTC, which increases the price of the alt market and [drops the price of the new BTC-copy-Goat-Shitcoin](
5. Then the pump begins. [The attackers start pumping their shitcoin]( but that only has a short fix as [more and more people start dumping their faux BTC]( 
6. Rinse repeat. 
They way I see it is that each fork attack, brings capital in from the attackers and distributes it between the BTC and the ALT market in the long run and makes both stronger as a result. This will have less and less of an effect as each time it happens it reaffirms to the community which chain is the true bitcoin and which chain is copy cat fake. Micky Mouse mate.

Wait.. are you telling me ETC "won"? lol There only reason ETC is still a thing is because of people like Charles Hawskensen and Barry Silbert and a lot of BTC anti-forkers who wanted to show that forking will cause a split and it's a bad thing (which I understood why they did that). If you think ETC exists because it won, I want what you're smoking. Show me ONE token with any use that lives on ETC. 


Don't tell me you're one of those who call what happened a "bail-out"! It still runs unstoppable code, except for when it's a clear jack move and they steal everyones money!(and by everyone, i mean pretty much everyone. almost Every single ether holder bought some DAO tokens) Ethereum runs unstopable code, unless that code is fucking EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE UP in which case humans via a majority fork fix the issue. I don't see anything wrong with that. It's like saying 


Ethereum Smart Contracts better called automated contracts are there to help humans and the community,  not to fuck shit up up, and in case it does, if the overwhelming majority agree, (which they did) then we can fork and see who wins. 
Also, it's not a bailout. in a bailout, you take money from everyone and give it to a bank because they lost all the money betting. What happened in ethereum was the money was taken from a thief ( i swear, if you claim that guy had the RIGHT to use the recursive call bug to drain the dao, then this conversation is over.) and given to the people he stole the money from. it's like a reverse bail-out.

bitcoin is even more rare, more transportable as it weighs nothing, more verifiable, (every time it changes hands, it gets re-casted to make sure it's not tungsten) and the jewelry thing .. you have it backwards buddy. 
The reason people wore gold as jewelry, was because it was a way for them to transfer their wealth around with them not because it was pretty. Spanish Pyrite is more pretty. but with technology, you can transfer your wealth around with you (invisibly ) either in your head or on a paper.

A few? 
Thats over 200 people! yes, some don't contribute or haven't in a while but thats not "a few". Is english your second language? few is like 5 to 10.  2x has... not a few .. but a couple, (2) developers and one of them, that Garlic Bread has been working on banging out an ICO just in time to make some sweet sweet CASYH on a shitcoin!  YOU ARE FUCKING HILARIOUS 


Jihan controls the majority hash power! His company literally makes over 70% of sha256 chips for mining.  DO. YOU. FUCKING. UNDERSTAND? I know Jihan is asian, i think you're confusing him with Satoshi! majority hash power MEANS ABSOLUTELY SHIT. So with your logic, if intels decides to make mining chips and take over the hash power by 90% suddenly the whole bitcoin community has to do what intel wants? are you out of your fucking mind?


MUH censorship! i can't even reply to people on more than once in 8 minutes. And my other accounts are banned. let me find my fucking violin 


oh you mean like this? 
that looks organic as fuck!! as organic as a hot pocket. your hypocrisy is mind numbing. 


Dumb idea. 


You touched on it alright. Harvey winestein style. 


Oh you're about find out. hopefully the hard way. Hopefully you sold most your btc for bcash. and you'll sell the rest for shit2x


NO. we will defend against the 2x attack and we'll grow stronger from it. One more attack bitcoin will be immuned  from. Fork attacks. 


NO. ShaolinFry and UASF and core DEVS got us SegWit. 2x GOT US JACK FUCKING SHIT!

Then I won't.  I'm not retarded.  Both core and big blockers have laid out their case. I've been involved since 2013. I have a good understanding of the tech and the characters roaming around.  I've used my brain and determined that this is an attack on bitcoin and what it stands for.  If they ask me to jump off cliff,  I will have to reassess the situation.  Until then,  I strongly believe in their technical abilities and their goals.  Any other stupid questions?

no. Your wallet contains keys. Public key and a private key! a public Address, not to be confused with a public key, is also known as your "bitcoin address" 
if you "own" bitcoins, it means at some point, someone gave you some. (unless you're a miner in which case you get it from a coinbase transaction, not to be confused with coinbase the company)  so when that person "gave you " bitcoins, it means they digitally signed a transaction that says " me alice, wanna give 0.1 BTC to Bob (you) and they used your "bitcoin address" in this thing called output script. They only way anyone can claim it is if they can solve the output using their private key! Thats were your wallet comes in. Now you can "send" those coins to another person by signing a transaction that gives your coins to another person(public address) and it goes on.  
it's just a giant chain of digital signatures.

They were also necessary, granted, but every. single. one of those companies mentioned above must have intimate relationships with the banks in order for their operation to work. Their business models can come crashing down over night, by banks deciding to cut them off. I'd say thats some heavy leverage the banks enjoy, and you want the community to trust them? Banks? Did you forget? Those are -not- examples you want to showcase. Talk about a huge red flag! If I had to pick between Brian Armstrong and Luke-Jr as to which one has the community's interest in mind and which one is motivated by profit, it would be the easiest choice in the world akin to having the option to rub my balls on a cactus, vs not have to rub my balls on said cactus.

Ah! pulling their investment out of crypto and put it in where? Stocks? well, you just said they were crashing? Cash? odds are, if the market is crashing QE is right around the corner. or maybe even negative interest rates. Meaning if you pull out cash, you'd have to pay the bank to store it for you, unless you're going to put the bags under your mattress, and QE is going to devalue the LIVING SHIT out of your cash, unlike anything before. This QE has to be bigger than all the other ones combined. Gold? bricks or comex paper trash? where are you going to put your money if the market is crashing? think about it.

 1. exchanges have fat wallets. 
 2. people have multiple wallets. 
 3. lots of early wallets with fat btc stacks are lost because people simply didn't care that they had 300 btc worth 8 dollars on their old HD they trashed. 
No real good way of knowing who owns how much. 
also, you should have learned about bitcoin earlier. same with me. but we didn't but there was no barrier to entry for any of us except for knowledge unlike now, which requires you to pop out of a specific vagina on a specific patch of dirt.

TCP/IP and BGP are like 30 years old and you use it everyday to shitpost. 


transactions are clearing for about 10 sat/byte (less than a dollar) right now as we speak. Also, mem-pool attack has been going on for almost 2 years now. finally it's starting to die off. Also, LIGHTNING FUCKING NETWORK YOU FUCKING MORON. 




so the FED and central banking (fractional) has been around for thousands of years? thousands? are you sure? are you fucking sure you brainlet?


say, how much sovereign debt is out there? how many trillions of dollars do we owe to banks? who apparently go broke every dozen years or so and we have to bail them out? how crooked is this system? who made these decisions that made us to be in such debt? is it even 1 100th of 1% of the people? we should feed them (and you) to hyenas! all of them those fucking savages. 


YOU MISSED IT BY HUNDREDS OF TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS!!! WHAT?? ARE YOU JUST STEALING MONEY? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?


your argument has no legs! it's like a dead snake. 


no one cares you have .001 btc and 300 tron! 


it's not about making money. it's about fixing a broken system. 
you know whats funny? You call me a bag holder now, but when btc hits 50K, then suddenly "im lucky" for getting in early. no one forgets the risk and balls it took to hold through these times.

nope not true.  They support a standard called BIP39. You generate you bip39 wallet on the HW, or you can generate it any other way and import it to your wallet. HW has no fucking clue what your seed is. 


again.. no. It's a standard. Ledger nano goes out of biz? oh well. I'll import my **bip 39 seed which is 12 words into any other wallet supporting BIP39**


again... 12 fucking words! break it? fell in the toilet? get a new wallet, import your 12 words... and you're back to normal.

SEGWIT was activated on the Bitcoin Blockchain.  Thats a major upgrade.  so, not sure what the fuck you're talking about. hanging out in too much eh?


no, thats not why the ice age was created. ice age was created so it pushes the miners out when it's time to shift to POS, and that was actually a good idea. If you wanna go to POS. Bitcoin has no intentions of going to POS. so, no need for an ice age.

Why would you side with people like Jeff/Roger/Craig/Jihan instead of Andreas/adam back/maxwell/Pieter Wuille/Nick /Rusty etc etc. and basically everyone who helped build this thing.  Jeff hasn't made a single contribution to bitcoin since 2014. Now he is doing an ICO for a cross atomic swaps? didn't Charlie do a X atomic swap with someone already?
Why do we need an ICO? Roger, i know you're buds, but come on man. seriously? Craig? that ass hat kangaroo in mom jeans who lied about having a super computer?! pardon my french.  Jihan? the literal bond villain who had taken bitcoin hostage until UASF enriching himself with his patented ASICBOOST??
How is that even a difficult decision?  I'm not listening to "trolls" bud. I've been involved in the community for a while now. I know who is who.

let me help you understand.
It's not a wallet! don't think of it as a wallet. Think of it as a keychain. all bitcoins are tied to a keychain. There is a private key and a public key. So long as you have the private key you can create the public key from it, but not the other way around. Bitcoin addresses come from public keys but they are not public keys but thats not that important.
bitcoin blockchain is a giant cloud computer that you can access anywhere. Think of it as a giant locker room with trillions and trillions of lockers. Using your private key, you can give owndership of those coins to another person using their PUBLIC address! it's just a giant chain of ownerships.
now, when you have a web wallet on an exchange, YOU DON"T HAVE THE PRIVATE KEY! THEY DO. so, you can't have those coins on a say a hardware wallet. But if you have the private key (which now you can remember by those 12 or 24 seed words) you can "have control" of those coins on as many Hardware wallets, and software wallets as you want.
hope that helped.

Well at least you admit it.  They have created a key pair in their Genesis block that 'no one knows the private key of part' and if you did, you could create unlimited units without ANYONE NOTICING.  The public part is used for zero knowledge.  Let that sink in.  Talk about trust less.  So they created this elaborate key ceremony to show that they created that key pair without  anyone knowing it.  But then again,  I saw David Blane bring  a seemingly dead bird back to life.  So....

You're not storing your bitcoin in a ledger.  You store your keys in a ledger.  You use the ledger to digitally sign transactions so you don't have to do it on a regular computer because the are most likely Pownd. If Google blocks Leger apps,  which they won't,  then I'm  sure they'll make a firefox plug in. And if that doesn't work,  then use a different device to sign your transactions. They coins are not in a ledger.  Ledget has the keys.  And you should back up the keys.

1. exchanges have fat wallets. 
2. people have multiple wallets. 
3. lots of early wallets with fat btc stacks are lost because people simply didn't care that they had 300 btc worth 8 dollars on their old HD they trashed. 
that pie chart is retarded. it doesn't represent reality. 
also, you should have learned about bitcoin earlier. same with me. but we didn't but there was no barrier to entry for any of us except for knowledge unlike now, which requires you to pop out of a specific vagina on a specific patch of dirt.

this is exactly why N00bs to crypto, start with bitcoin, but then quickly shift to shitcoins. They feel like they are getting in early on a project and it will be the next bitcoin. but since there are literally thousands of new coins now, they don't have the network effect. so they double their money and if they are smart enough they start putting in their gains in bitcoin. Bitcoin goes from 5k to 20k, and N00bs join bitcoin, rinse and repeats.  but im sorry, thats just life. Life is not fair. But at least with bitcoin, there is no printing press for the rich

It's not based on a date. It's based on a blocknumber.  Blocks get solved roughly every 10 minutes.  But it's very rough.  Sometimes people find blocks in a few minutes,  sometime it takes like 30 or 40 minutes.  Due to the fact that there is a lot of randomness involved, coming to a exact date and time is not possible.  You can only guess.  The closer you get, the more clear it gets.

You're the one who is a brain-washed clueless parrot. 
The reasons they give you, in your $200 college books is not the real reason your fool.  The reason we have inflation is because they want to be able to print as much money as they want. The reason they wanna do that is because thats how they finance their wars.  If Bush went on tv and said: 


we would tell him to go stick it up his ass.  Using inflation you can finance what ever the fuck you want now and you'll have the future generation pay for it. Stealing money from infants take some pretty nimble fingers.

Imagine a nuclear power-plant that was created from the ground up by a group of roughly 200 people. they know it inside out. then after 8 years, some land developers, and advertising agent, and a firecracker salesman tell everyone that they need to increase the load of this to twice capacity and everything will be just fine. One or two of the people who were in the original group of 200 agree, but they seem shady AS FUCK! but the other 190 plus disagree and say we should not do that.   
which way should we proceed?

I want you to understand what's going on. 
When you send a BTC to some one, you are signing a transaction. Digitally. BitcoinCash, BitcoinGold, BitcoinDogshit etc get airdropped to your BTC. meaning if you had 1 BTC in address X in the -bitcoin- blockchain, you now have 1 BTG(bitcoin"gold") in that same address X in the retarded bitcoingold Blockchain. 
now, if you sign to send .5 Bitcoin Gold to Bob, you sign with address X .5 BitcoinGold to Bob.  that gets broadcasted in the BitcoinGold blockchain. Anyone, can take that TX, and replay it on the actual BitcoinBlockchain and you will effectively signed .5 actual Bitcoins to bob and you will lose.  
same the other way. If you send .5 bitcoin to bob on the bitcoin chain, bob or anyone can replay that TX on the bitcoinGold blockchain and you will lose your bitcoin gold to bob also! 
now, greedy mofos will try to capitalize on the "free" money in a form of bitcoingold, and they will try to sell it. They will also, lose their actual bitcoin.   so, to make 400 bucks, they will lose 6000. lol
but if you don't care about bitcoingold, and you need to transact NOW, then who cares if you lose your bitcoingold. It will go to a few bucks soon anyway. IMO&gt; 
do what you gotta do!

go fix your wallet. 


If that is indeed the case, why do all other reputable desktop wallets perform this encryption in the correct manner, thus safeguarding our wallets, and only Jaxx does not?
Desktop wallets that DO CORRECTLY ENCRYPT your wallet: Exodus, MyEtherWallet, geth, parity, electrum.
 Desktop wallets that DO NOT CORRECTLY ENCRYPT your wallet: Jaxx.
(Jaxx “encrypts” the wallet seed, but with a hard-coded and easily extracted key, which means this is not encryption but rather obfuscation, which is not much better than no encryption.)

They can fork the codebase and I'd be fine and wouldn't call it an attack. When they fork and take the history it's an attack.  When you see the characters who are involved,  you know it's an attack.  I'm sorry Erik but I disagree.

nope. Sad to say it's not and devs said they will not fix the seed leak issue and they said " hey.. don't store a lot of money in it.. kay? kay!)  
I deleted it and changed my seed.

This will be a great lesson for the next group of idiots trying to hijack bitcoin in the future.  Hopefully people will get burned and 'ouch...  That's fire it burns'  they will learn not to touch it anymore .
