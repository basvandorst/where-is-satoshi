A big reason why Sweden is high on the list is the advocacy provided by Rick Falkvinge, the founder of the Swedish Pirate Party.  He has written a number of good blog posts on the subject.  The first one seems to be [With The Napster of Banking Round The Corner, Bring Out Your Popcorn]( and I think you can find most of the other ones by following the appropriate links in the article.

Does this program really need to send emails?  Seems a bit worrisome to me.
    $ strings "Bitcoin Trader.exe" | grep -i EHLO
    EHLO

Is it just me or is the slow order queuing of Mt. Gox annoying?  Regardless, I'm not very worried.

It should be noted, though, that among these asks are a couple of large individual asks, e.g. one for ~6384BTC at $15.50.

Confirmed. Watermarked here as well.
Best bet is to contact the authors directly and ask for a copy.

A question concerning the [network section]( Isn't megabit in networking terminology usually referring to 10⁶ bits and not 2²⁰ bits? If so then the required bandwidth should be about 8.2 megabit/s rather than 7.8 megabit/s as stated on the wiki (for 2000 tps and 512 byte average transaction size). Not a big difference but I got curious.
