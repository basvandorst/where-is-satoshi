Look, I'm not debating index funds, and I haven't said a thing about them.
Your oversimplification of the available vehicles is what I'm beefing with. The average joe doesn't have the cash to go into the market at $50/share or higher, so they're going to end up getting into the riskier sides of the market.
If you're someone who's wise enough to play the long game, and who's removed any attachment to the money you put into it, you can come out sane. If you're someone who's looking for a quick buck, or a get-rich-quick, you're setting yourself up for disappointment and a pretty decent tax burden.
I've tested and passed both Series 7 and 63, albeit a couple years back, so I'm not making this stuff up. I've personally placed thousands of stock orders and spent 9+ hours a day for a year steeping in the market, thanks to my (then-)employer's mandatory overtime rules and my own personal interests.
It sounds like you're spoiling for a fight rather than being interested in a discussion. Good luck with that.

*Just one each, though.*

Yeah, I gathered that through all the shouting.. Some folks want to yell and be right more than they want to listen and figure out where the other person is coming from  
Meh. Internet.

You're backwards here a bit - once your money is in the market, it's *gone*. If you manage to get money back out of the market, then more power to you - but there's NO guarantee that "after a bad year in the stock market, you'll still have money". Stocks DO drop to zero, and not uncommonly.
Don't get me wrong - I'm pro-investment, but the notion that the stock market is somehow safer than BTC is flawed; the market is gambling, just like investments in BTC. It's just been around longer and people think it's safer. It's not.

Re-read my comment. MOST folks aren't hearing "Index Fund" when you talk about the stock market, they're hearing "stocks".
You ought a tone back that vitriol a little, too - I'm not your enemy.

Got you - when I said "it's gone", I was making reference to it no longer being "money" per es, just numbers in a machine. Similar to the detachment from investments I referenced.
