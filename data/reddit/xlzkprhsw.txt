nice try, genesis block

nothing is final, son. roll the ancap-bullshit and stick it back up your ass. bitcoin is pretty much capitalists business now. your job is done here, clowns. you can fuck off now. just watch what grown ups do with the toy you found and brought home. I'm looking forward to the days when we can purchase slaves, jets, wars and femine with bitcoin also. beautiful times ahead. anyone who thinks that bitcoin's going to improve society is a lazy and naive moron trying to avoid the actual work of improving society. bitcoin technology just going to re-distribute the wealth from old evil to new evil, like internet did, like tv did, like internal combustion engine did, like fire and stick did. the only difference will be that the new evil can bullshit you, sheeple, better, that's all - it's got facebook now, you know, no need in TV anymore. you may take the currency control from the evil but this won't make evil go. the evil will find ways and shift the emphasis. bitcoin technology won't change the basic law: if you are ignorant or dead - you are not a problem.

I'm a heavy user of bitcoin and I was initially put off by this ancap-bullshit. But when I saw that ancap has nothing to do with it - I continued to ignore it like the most people do.

500... hm... I can give you 50% cut, but I won't pay 500 today..

jokes aside, kids, this is going to be tough test (why is Gavin hiding in Australia behind his family?)
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:41:02
the group of "don't trust bitcoin" is bigger and therefore it a bigger groupthink..
@_date: 2013-10-13 19:08:33
nope... the chart is big-3 vs. chinabtc, but bitcoinity says that big-3 hold 60% of volume in the last 24hrs
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:33:37


no. only 10m will be left to 'play around with' after I'm finished buying.

o, come on!!! this is not insulting at all! this kid at least called me an "asshole" - you can do better. come on, use your imagination and creativity, fuel it with hate and righteousness. for the mankind and all the noble values. please! think properly and try once again.
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:54:06
of course
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:15:16
I hope someone has already pointed this out, but in case not:
in your quora-article in this sentence you probably meant "then" instead of "or":
If any of those 300 entities get compromised or malevolent attackers will be able to read your email, access your bank account, and violate your privacy.

fuck off, no bitcoin begging here. I also typed up all my teen jerking off phantasies in a pdf file. you can have it for 0.5 btc. today's offer just for you!
@_date: 2013-07-17 18:17:43
I'd love to take yours..
@_date: 2013-10-07 23:12:07
ahh... fuck it - I'm leveraged in bitcoin 3 times my liquidity (hundreds of thou of dollars)... If bitcoin fucks up - I'll restart life. ;)

sell your shit on ebay physically - you'll see how people value different pieces - whether 1 dollar or say 2. you'll also see what people value more - like tits - you can paint then more tits to make money faster. experiment and combine a bit, different colors, sizes, more tits, less tits, maybe pussy will be a hit - you can sell it for 10 a piece. do speed-painting really fast, hire slaves to paint like you in high volumes - get rich, cancel that useless semesters of yours, buy lots of pussy yourself, have fun, get on reddit brag a bit about how you made it in life, piss off some kids who're trying..
@_date: 2013-07-17 18:43:10
not helpful - lot's of distraction there, but nothing about tipping anyone with bitcoin on reddit. I'm going to exercise the "bother-someon-with-instant-chat"-option - see where this takes me..

this has become a bitcoin-promotion reddit. it's like is not really news... 
time has come for a dedicated or similar..

you are being paranoid about privacy-concerned technically verse people..
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:48:17
what do you mean "critical mass" - there are a lot of critics already
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:14:27
hey.. don't get it? - don't buy / sell it then
@_date: 2013-08-21 20:04:06
"...with style!" - with money I'd rather advise "with caution".

always a pleasure :) it's just.... did you ever check out who owns the other dollars?
@_date: 2013-11-03 17:54:51
kids, your premature over-anticipation ruins it. shut the fuck up.. either go trade or go to bed.
@_date: 2013-07-28 17:17:10
I really like the graphs - they really show how really trully anonymous bitcoin is. you can buy anything and nobody know! not disappont!
@_date: 2013-11-11 00:34:52
judging by invited parties bitcoin vs. LE &amp; banks, it will be very tough to spin it into a positive event for bitcoin. (why there are no scientists, IT-specialists, cryptographers, mathematitians invited?)
LE &amp; banks already know everything they want to know about bitcoin as does the government (remember: there is google and they have NSA-security-experts and billions in budgets working for them and if they'd figured out how to benefit from bitcoin, they'd be doing it already and keep it all quiet).
it's a PR event to produce the justification for actions against bitcoin. all that needs to be planted into public and officials minds through state-run massmedia is "bitcoin = illegal (LE+SR) money laundring (banks)". this is where the discussion will be steered, I think..
but I'd love to be wrong on this one..

@_date: 2013-07-17 19:04:46
done, but I didn't mean this reddit-gold-funky-stuff (though thanks for making me try this out), I meant this robot/bot/script/whatever which leaves nice traces like "tip 0.00someDecimals" ---&gt; confirmed" or similar - I thought this is like.. cool and shit, you know.. I mean the dude opened me eye on online-prostitution - that's life-changing enlightenment for me right there.. I have a purpose in life now and finally a community with whom I can share and sympathize. I need someone to open my other eye on offline-bitcoin-pussy though - that'd  be a real life application. lot's of potential and great opportunities there I sense, Luke. be the wisdom and power with us, my friend.. and soberness..

does this screenshot actually associate a first &amp; last name with movies torrent/downloading/distribution? is that legal in your country?

thanks! how do I tip you with that reddit-btc-tip robot/plugin/whatever?
