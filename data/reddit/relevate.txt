There are a lot of positive reviews written for BitQuick  -- bittrust.org/bitquickco
This just adds to their good reputation

Although I'm sure he'll never do it and should focus his time on Overstock, I'm pretty split about this idea. On the one hand, he has done a tremendous job of making Bitcoin more mainstream for availability by the public but on the other hand, I believe the business representative on the Bitcoin board should be more intimately familiar with Bitcoin beyond simply just being a payment system.

I remember discussing with some high school students about buying things online. Being under 18 and unable to get a credit card, the only way to order items is by purchasing a visa gift card with cash or borrowing a parent's card -- and the latter isn't a popular option.
For bitcoins to have real utility for teens as a currency, there needs to be an easy way to convert cash to bitcoins. Aside from the bitcoin ATM, I'm not sure how else this could be accomplished efficiently.

Beautiful website and product. I noticed an ad for the personal block parser. How much storage space does this take up and how does it work? Is the data parsed into a query-able database?

This is no doubt for a great cause for both the world and the bitcoin community, but how can you guarantee that the money is going to the right place?

Fixed, thanks for letting me know about that!
