Hey KFC, way to gain a LOT of enemies in the crypto world with that comment. Doesn't seem very smart to me. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:59:06
NEO is nice as well.
@_date: 2018-01-10 07:46:20
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:28:50
Just buy ethereum and get it over with. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:18:23
If you don't know the answer to that, then you shouldn't be holding/investing in crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:18:10
Would also pay for this once its released.
NEO wallet tracking is a must for me. 
Great job doing something we've been all waiting for.
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:01:29
That lil beauty is ugly af. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:36:45
No man. Lol
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:28:23
What would happen to Bitcoin Cash if/when that happens? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:34:27
He cares. That's who
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:14:21
So wait, now Bitcoin Core is the victim? ...since when?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:50:06
Yes. People like me bought before. I bought because I'd info on Reddit. There are no arguments. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:06:01
I found a pass phrase with many words in it. I believe I tried to obfuscate it by adding decoys, but I know its an old BIP passphrase, how do I access old versions of BIP to test them out?
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:47:49
I sure hope you forgot your /s because y your 'source' can't be the movie taken... 
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:33:18
Lol. You do know that's the standard for all exchanges now, right?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:54:44
Yes, coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:23:23


@_date: 2017-12-13 06:42:57
Calm down.
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:14:45
Like ethereum? And many others by the way. Bitcoin is the only sub that doesn't have consistent interesting content. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:49:40
The point of bitcoin is to bring attention to ethereum and other better tech. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:43:16
What a fucking child. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 08:35:10
What about Tyson vs McGregor? 
@_date: 2018-05-02 05:19:37
This is lame. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:41:50
Yes, I follow the news sometimes. But I assure you I am not nor do I feel part of this community anymore.
You can have it to yourself. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:19:39
So? How much was there?! I'm so curious! :) 
@_date: 2018-05-27 10:30:04
If what you have is an address, you can at least look up the amount of btc in it.
And see if it's worthwhile to go through the trouble. It's possible it's empty.
Check on blockchain.info
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:44:00


You're doing it wrong. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:48:19
Maybe he means voluntarily cut off from the system. As in off the grid. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:22:24
You're right, ethereum. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 05:51:12
This comment is lame. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 08:38:19
u/fredrock12 can chime in
@_date: 2018-05-31 21:39:04
That's how this sub used to be... until it transformed into what it is now. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:43:56
And makes bitcoin seem scammy by making shit up.
@_date: 2018-05-05 15:26:18
Wasn't ver super liked before this bch debate? His nickname bitcoin Jesus isn't for nothing... 
@_date: 2018-05-02 09:18:10
just... stop.
@_date: 2017-08-28 07:50:48
The only philosophy investors have is: make more money.
In this case, they are effectively reducing their (already niche) target public to half (?).
All but one of my investors think like this. It's their ultimate goal, they rarely think like me and have the same goals as me other than making more money. This is not only my view, but of everyone around me with situations like mine.   
The one difference is the investor that invested in me, as a person, not me as a team member or our product.
@_date: 2018-06-21 11:25:06
There isn't. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 17:06:38
You could do ethtrader. They have a daily since a long time ago.
Another thing you should consider is to normalize data with amount of redditors subscribed as to eliminate the correlation more people - - -&gt; more comments. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 07:57:20
I'm on the same boat.
I'll diversify... when crypto allows me to FIRE. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 23:24:43
Wtf. Get out of here. Take off that tin foil cap and gtfo
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:20:08
No one can answer that for you, you should do this own research and make your own decision. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:33:16
During stagnation there usually is only infighting with rbtc. I rarely see quality content anymore and I agree with OP. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:32:53
I'm not going to risk answering that for him. Most people on this subreddit you can assume are already invested. Are they still buying? go ask them.
I'm not going to give investment advice to someone who might possibly sell his house to buy bitcoin at ATH.
If he wants to invest in something, especially something as volatile as crypto, let him do his homework.
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:43:26
Yes. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:16:00
Super interesting. thanks for that comment. I still wouldn't buy one but interesting nonetheless. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:41:04
And don't stop typing nor posting. Not because some rando internet zealot tells you to. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:31:18
I agree, I should've added that.
@_date: 2017-10-22 08:45:49
I got this same advice told to me yesterday by my older brother.
He's got no fucking blue what crypto is, and has never been able to save more than 5000 in his life (not because he doesn't have access to money, though).
Having said that, its very important to have a plan- and to stick with it.
I don't think the generic 50% advice is good for everyone.
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:35:58
How the F cares what that idiot has to say?
@_date: 2018-04-15 22:58:51
Stop saying this. It's simply not true. You sound like idiots repeating the same mistaken phrases over and over again. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 12:05:19
Ethereum clad is very passionate about tech in general as well. So might be the case as well. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:42:59
I would argue Vitalik is genuinely in it for more than just the money.
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:01:07
Oh, If your buddy at the party said so. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 06:59:21
Why would you say that? I don't think it's a slow shutter photo. Looks like a regular cell phi e took the picture. Probably some  hdr in the phone's software as well. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 11:25:24
Blockchain technology is the future, the faster it gets adopted, the better.
