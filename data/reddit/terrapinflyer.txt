The lag in verification is not a new thing, it took me 2 months to get verified when I submitted my info in April of 2013. I just waited to trade at Gox, shit I actually forgot that I submitted my info till I got an email telling me I was good to go. I hear noting but bad things about Gox and I have had 0 issues as of now. On the other hand I have had plenty of issues with Bitstamp and I see posts daily about Coinbase having deposit/withdrawal issues. I think that they all have there issues and its up to you as a consumer to make a decision where to trade and who to trust.

I received my 500 two days ago and I have to say that I was less then impressed. My plan was to leave these around my small town to spread awareness about bitcoin and to hopefully answer some questions that people may have. After receiving them I plan on contacting bigfoot and asking if he wants me to return these. I have no plans of leaving these anywhere of even showing them to a single person. In fact I had a close friend in my kitchen today asking me to explain bitcoin and I didnt even show them this brochure. IMHO these provide almost no actually information about bitcoin that is reverent. Some buzz words and some ads that is about it.

I disagree, I think this has everything to do with Bitcoin. Im not sure you fully understand what Bitcoin is attempting to do if you dont see that. 
"You the people have the power"
 
"Let us fight for a new world, a decent world. 
That will give men a chance to work. 
That will give you the future and the old age the security. 
By the promise of these things brutes have risen to power, but they lie.
They do not for fill their promises, they never will. 
Dictators free themselves but enslave the people. 
Now let us fight to fore fill that promise! 
Let us fight to free the wold! 
To do away with national barriers. 
To do away with greed. 
To do away with hate and intolerance. 
Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all mens happiness."

How exactly does Bitcoin scare banks? As far as I know when you make a transfer to Coinbase the **bank** receives a fee on both ends. Also the transfer to Coinbase is to a **bank** **account** where all there holdings of fiat is held. When you cash out from Coinbase they send USD back to your **bank** taking a fee from both end once again. So it seems to me banks are doing just fine with Bitcoin as of rite now. In fact I have never bought a Bitcoin that I didnt have to walk into a bank to buy.

I have to strongly disagree. I think that bitcointalk.org is THE place for technical facts and intelligent conversations about bitcoin. In fact I think this sub is a joke with more misinformation then any other place I frequent for bitcoin news.  Bitcointalk.org has many key features such as the trust system to help prevent people from scamming, although it has its flaws if used correctly you will have some great success with trading. Beyond the trust system there is a huge community of intelligent well informed people that are very active in that community.

And this average is on the low side considering almost no miners are currnelty getting 1W/GH/s and [almost no one gets power for 10c/KWH]( 
This topic is covered in the [Myths]( section to the wiki bitcoin page.


This statement is an attempt to apply to Bitcoin the labor theory of value, which is generally accepted as false. Just because something takes X resources to create does not mean that the resulting product will be worth X. It can be worth more, or less, depending on the utility thereof to its users.
In fact the causality is the reverse of that (this applies to the labor theory of value in general). The cost to mine bitcoins is based on how much they are worth. If bitcoins go up in value, more people will mine (because mining is profitable), thus difficulty will go up, thus the cost of mining will go up. The inverse happens if bitcoins go down in value. These effects balance out to cause mining to always cost an amount proportional to the value of bitcoins it produces.

Fuck this guy (not the OP). You know what is rite you absolutely owe it to the community to oust this thief. If you dont and wait the 5 years to get paid back you will either feel like shit because you know its all stolen money or never get paid at all. Bitcoin is based on trust and being personally responsible for your own actions. You have an obligation to flush this rat out. The attempt to beg for money because of your own missteps is pathetic, I have sympathy for your situation but will not be paying some ransom. You owe it to your community, not just the bitcoin world to expose this scam artist before he hurts more families like yours.  If you allow this guy to run around unexposed you will be responsible for anyone else he undoubtedly will rip off .

When you put so much of your capital in at one time you get emotionally attached to the investment and that can cause you to make some bad decisions. You are oblivious very emotional about this investment maybe you should take a deep breath and take smaller steps into a new market.

Just because a video is awesomely produced does not mean that people behind it are trustworthy.
Amir has a clear responsability in the bitcoinica trainwreck, that left several people that commited their ressources to the bitcoin vision financially crippled.
And now, you want to give him funds and trust him with your bitcoins ?
I can tell you what will happen if things go south, you wont have anybody to turn to.
Of course Amir's responsability is completly shared by Zhou tong and others.
But you are here jumping from project from project, why is your ex partner Patrick Strateman blocking the bitcoinica liquidation ? Can you answer that ? Can you try to help handle that instead of jumping to whichever project sounds the coolest ?
It would be great if we, bitcoinica claimants, could at any point in the future get any closure. We are far from that and all responsible protagonnists have left the sinking ship.

How did he get a deal? When he bought the car he paid full price. Just like he would have paid full price today. You missing the concept of bitcoin and all you see is a chart. Do you look at gas prices and say "damn I should have bought last year and held, the US dollar was worth so much more then..."?
Lets review the deal for the car.
The guy decieds hes buying a car, he gos to the dealership and gets a price. Then he spends USD on bitcoin. He then sends the bitcoin to the dealership. Dealership converts to USD. 
How did anyone get a deal or burned on that transaction.?

Can I join your guild? I studied under Cathe' Fish and got my PDC in 2011. Since I have been practicing in Mendocino Ca. This post has just inspired me to call Cathe' and talk to her about BTC, we have had many discussions about the downfall of the banking system and how to put the power back in the hands of the people. Except for the enormous cost in electricity to support the network BTC is pretty permaculture.
