@_date: 2017-12-07 13:19:09
A certain percentage of buyers today dont plan on selling any time soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:53:57

How many trillions would have to be in for btc to hit 1 million ?? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:11:43
Have ever been to bitcoin.com. Especially as a new person to cryptos. Yeah nuf said. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:18:53
Not to bloat but i have trezor it took about 3 min. Like they all said. Give it time check addresses. If correct it will get there. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:58:35
They are not crashes they are corrections and usually happen fast. So just keep an eye on the market buy the dips. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:02:05
20k then down to 16k
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:33:48
In 2040 we wont need to sell our btc 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:22:33
Is it true cboe is not trading now ? ! 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:13:44

@_date: 2017-12-01 02:51:04
Got in at 1181. Then dropped to 980 for a while. Hodl. Trust the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:21:34
What attack ?? I know price is down but what is the atrack. Or just a correction from panic and people taking profits. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:42:13
Don’t believe everything the mainstream media decides to shove down your throat. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:24:38
Yeah that “will be” cool !!

@_date: 2019-08-16 16:44:22
@_date: 2019-10-05 06:54:20
Set limits. If it goes under 1k it would be for under for seconds. Blood rewards.
@_date: 2019-10-11 22:35:41
Centralized crypto won’t ever work.

@_date: 2017-11-27 02:51:30
They tax it like a commodity right now 30% if you sell within a year. 15-20% if you hold longer than a year. Tax man always gets some lol. Sux. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 16:59:04
Bullish 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:27:30
Haha we shall see. That would be epic sale price !!! Buy the dips !! 
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:05:55
Whenever you feel like you should sell. Do to many personal and financial reasons. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:20:39
Blaa blaaa bla blaa 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:06:56
Bl blaaa blaaaa bla blaa. Think we all saw this coming. The tax man always gets some. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:09:45
U.s can go ahead a make them illegal. We dont need ever country to be on board to make cryptos worth something. Just as long as you have yours in a hardware wallet they have no idea you have them. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:20:29
Hell yeah good on you bra !! Not saying anything negative.. just referring to everyone last week saying if there was a HUGE price correction they would buy tons more. Just fact checking thats all. Glhf !! Btw big gains on this end too :) 
@_date: 2019-06-04 12:52:51
Instead of “hodl” in the dips. It needs to start saying “buy”.   Just saying.
@_date: 2019-02-03 15:20:49
How do these stores make money ??
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:15:53

@_date: 2017-11-30 04:05:15
@_date: 2019-10-05 03:59:09
If it goes under 1000$. Im all in !!!
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:44:17
If it goes to 45k ill be happy lol let alone 500k. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:47:07
I am not going to lie it is a risky investment, unproven but if you are in it for the long-haul it should work out..when I first bought it dropped 300$$the next day.....hodl.  Go long. 3-4 years. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:48:15
Can i please have a burrito 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:10:02
Should i sell lol. Why did you buy ?? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:29:33
For example coinbase. Hit buy tab and type in 50.00$ in the dollar box and it will translate that value to the amount of btc it will buy at the time. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:34:24
Lol all the negativity. I can tell you all bought recently. “Welcome to the show “. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:15:41
Instant buy but you wont receive for balance for 6-7 days. You are locked in at that price though 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:07:54
Get ready to be blown the ef away.  Hodl !! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:39:54
Truth. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:35:12
Capital flight !! Moon. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:28:54
You can. Litcoin will go up and down in value also, but not as much as btc. Transactions will are faster on litecoin. So the thinking is in the future  litecoin will be used for everyday shopping. Btc will be big purchases and storing wealth. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:54:22
Me too. Invested in 2016. Safe and sound. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:58:54
Yeah bought satoshi's at 7200. So this will help average for sure thanks bch !!!! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:31:21
 Because. Crypto still young. New money entering. Positive news. Moon incoming. Be prepared for the dip. ��
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:30:05
By the way yes gazillionare from btc profits !! Hodl !! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:29:05
Yeaaaaahh...... shows their intelligence. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:28:56
Yep buy coins when they are on sale. Works for me ! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:49:55
Same !! 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:11:40
Never ever sell and make them dollars then. Glhf 
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:28:02
This is a pure speculative buy. Btc has great potential but there are many unknowns only invest what you are willing lose.  Dont panic sell. Price always goes up and down. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:45:27
Coinbase, gemini then. Get ledger nano s. Or trezor to get it offline. And hodl. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:14:08
Humans. That is all. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:16:20
Only the strong will survive !! Hodl !! You know people got out and hours later it was to late to get back in lol opps. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:46:38
Just my guess.  Glhf !! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:30:28
Be patient 
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:16:35
Also never say on any social media platform how much you have. You become a target. Hackers love information 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:40:37
Multiple trezors. Update will. Leave seeds in very very safe places Like bank vaults. Safety deposit boxes. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:57:34
Do half if unsure. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:44:26
I hope you dont own take your analysis somewhere else glhf !!! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:59:28
Good luck trading. Hodl. Dont sell. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:14:10
Yeah wait for the turkey day pull back lots of newbs will be panic selling if theres a dip lol.

@_date: 2017-11-18 23:33:18

@_date: 2019-02-13 16:58:22

Do you even know how fast that will change  !!  Get in now and you will have excellent stories to tell when everyone is using the updated seamless system. Cause that will happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:18:54
Another nice thing is it never sleeps, its world wide, new exciting news all the time !! Addictive be careful though !! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:54:06
Well if you buy in 50$ and the price of btc goes up another 300% this year “example “. Then you made 300%, some say btc could 40k by August 2018 soooo.  Its all speculation. If we knew we would be billionaires glhf ! 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:33:17
I got in at 1100. It was to late ;)
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:35:04
Talk me into it. .......... hurry
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:09:04
There will be a definite pull back at 10k. No one knows how much and it maybe fast. My personal opinion is a 7% pull back. Then again it could be another 2 weeks til we hit 10k. We are in uncharted territory. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:18:08
Cryptos will dwarf all of these. Hodl people. Major world transfer of wealth wont be easy. Moon and beyond !! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:12:10
Yes no maybe so
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:04:13
Just a picture of the moon will do...
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:24:56
Between 0-18500k. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:22:03
Yes it will correct. But it might be a fast one dont fall asleep lol. Or set buy orders for 7% lower ! Glhf 
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:09:25
How bout trezor. Thats where mine are !

If btc is worth 1 million dollars. Then it wont be worth 1 million dollars......  the US dollar wont matter anymore. 
It will just be worth 1 btc. Which will be able to buy you a whole bunch of stuffs !!

Poloniex. Bittrex. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 00:59:44
Just seems like when btc goes up everything els goes up. Same with down. I know alt coins are cheaper and can get more for the money. I just think it's more of the lottery decision which altcoin will do good,,roll the dice. Or just buy all the btc and to the moon !! eventually lol like pretty much every analyst  is saying. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:58:57
Good job. This dip may be the last for awhile. Hodl 
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:22:54

Whenever people are going crazy and btc is at new heights sell 15% at the very least.  Then buy the drops. Because it will drop. Thats the nature of the beast. But act quickly lol glhf !! 
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:48:47

@_date: 2017-10-04 03:52:20
Trezor on Amazon. 58% off right now. Just read the reviews.

@_date: 2017-10-20 20:10:40
So in 2018 if we hit 1trillion. We should be at 60,000 btc. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:59:17
Btc would need lighting network for this to happen. 6-7 transactions per second isn't good enough yet. 
@_date: 2019-09-10 16:11:43
Id be cool with 389000
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:55:25
If so that will really help me lol....!!!!!!! And you gents too grats all !! 
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:04:58
Yeah i got mine new. Make sure its not a refurbished product. I choose trezor because it has a great support system. Can hold multiple coins. Recovery system looks solid if something goes wrong. 
@_date: 2019-09-19 00:35:59
Lots at that point.

So it sounds like we can keep them in coinbase. But not on gdax. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:20:24
Also use some if you can and immediately replace. 
@_date: 2019-09-17 17:14:24
This guy gets it.
@_date: 2017-10-02 20:17:22
So if I have 1 btc in my coinbase wallet I get one Bitcoin gold ?? The wallet is coinbase and the exchange is gdax  correct ??
@_date: 2018-07-27 16:01:35

@_date: 2018-04-17 14:20:37

@_date: 2018-12-07 03:58:45
Dca this bear market. When it turns around you will be thanking yourself. Crypto is the long game. Be patient. 
@_date: 2019-05-03 19:35:29
So glad I caught the bitcoin bug in 2016 ;)
@_date: 2019-05-03 23:15:39

@_date: 2018-12-14 16:59:56

@_date: 2018-12-15 00:50:49
