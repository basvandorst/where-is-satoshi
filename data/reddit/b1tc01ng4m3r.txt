With "provably fair" the game play itself is meant. The computer making its decision first and proving that it's not altered after the player made his / her move.

Yes, it's the payout structure.
Game FAQ, Point 5:
"Every time the computer wins, you loose your bet. For every win your balance is added 0.97 times the bet. A push (same choice by you and the computer) is not relevant for the balance. The odds for all three events are equal. Therefore the house edge is as small as 1%. In comparison, the house edge for Roulette is 2.7% (Single Zero) or 5.4% (Double Zero).
Calculation: 1/3 * 0 * bet (Push) + 1/3 * 0.97 * bet (Win) - 1/3 * 1 * bet (Loss) = -0.01 * bet"

Well, it's a game of pure chance. In the long run all three choices will be chosen an equal amount of times by the computer.

At least you could not buy such a high amount on any site at once. So maybe small (!!) amounts here and there from time to time - but it would take some time to get to $100 million. By this method you don't buy to high / low as you buy for the average over time.
Private sale from some early adopter that kept on to his / her coins and is now ready to sell. Or you buy other stuff for $100 million and sell this for Bitcoins over an online shop.
