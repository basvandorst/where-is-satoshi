There are a few projects aiming to do exactly that. And I'd look at bitcoin more or less as a digital store of value in this new era of economics being that it is deflationary. 
Edit: an irrefutable store of value at that.

Asset based tokens are being created. Even asset based token platforms to cater to the layman.

It is not simply a piece of code, it is a distributed ledger agreed on by everyone at the same time that has been around the longest deeming it the most secure. If you believe all cryptocurrencies are just aiming to be a store if value then you have a lot of research to do my friend.

Or it does Bart. You sell. It runs to 9k in the 6 other hours you sleep while you're tethered. Smart.

You must be loaded if you know what the markets going to do while you sleep.

It depends where you set your stop orders, they're usually high to increase your gains so it wouldn't have to "dip hard". Mostly I was just implying that it's all luck in this space. December was very fast.

Been holding since October, still better off than most people here����‍♂️ I'll see you in 2020.

Imagine if you set a stop order, the price dips, then it runs like December. You're all basing this on luck when you could just hold long term and reduce stress.
