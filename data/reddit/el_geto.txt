Can someone explain me the purpose for Bitcoin.org and why is important to Bitcoin?

That should be an easy task for a smart contract. One thing thou, no backsies

I agree, but that's very poor argument in favor of Bitcoin.  BTC has definitively more differentiable strengths than fiat currency, holding value is 1) really not unique to Bitcoin, any non-perishable good will hold value against a falling currency. 2) BTC volatility pretty much negates it as a safe investment. Buying a car would probably be a better way to maintain value than buying BTC.  You can do better

So it is the government that perpetuates what banks started, the 'inverted' pyramid scheme. 
I raise my case. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 15:09:16
I had a similar revelation last night, lending banks are essentially an 'inverted' pyramid scheme, backed by the government, which in turn also runs their own inverted pyramid scheme via the central bank. No wonder why the whole system is so fragile.

I was referring to the FDIC, which was created by the government to save banks during the Great Depression after banks running out of security deposits because of bank runs, and here we find ourselves again with financial institutions Too Big to Fail being saved by the government creating $ out of thin air.... Just wait until the pressure cooker of inflation starts whistling and we'll see Fiat Money at its best

Sadly this case is not how you are interpreting full friend comment. Petro as a public cryptocurrency does not exist, and I highly doubt that it exists as a private one. Since there is no Market, there is no price to peg the real currency to. Unfortunately this is a sad manipulation from the Government to try to give some 'credibility' to their currency by riding on the crypto fad.

Unrelated question here, what's the best way to convert Bitcoin to BGP. I set a friend up on Coinbase but they charge her £15 per BTC-&gt;GBP transaction

I have no sympathy for this guy, he's been known as a con man way before Megaupload and has been running from German authorities for a long time too.

Is not created out of thin air, is borrowed from future value generation.  Unless nothing of value gets generated, then it just goes into inflation 
@_date: 2019-03-15 11:17:10
You as the borrower are given money now based on a contract that you will repay it in X installments over Y time with Z interest. If you use that money to buy a car, and that car will allow you to get a better job, then that loan is generating value for you, and the overall economy.  If you use that money to pay other loans, then you’ve just generated nothing of value, just manipulated your time variable and the difference in interest from your previous loan, is inflation.

Venezuela is suffering from rampant inflation and strict capital controls, yet you don't see such Bitcoins businesses. Definitively there are adoption barriers, education and basic infrastructure (e.g. electricity,network). The first can be done, the second, not as easy.

It would take about 3,700 bills of their highest denomination.  Probably a shoebox chock full.

They do. Most of their electricity is low cost hydro power, which helped develop their mining and metallurgical industry, with easy access to the Caribbean via the Orinoco river making steel and aluminum competitive and accessible to the whole region, but most of their revenue of late came from oil and gas.  All this from a country a bit bigger than Texas
