Wouldn't it be prudent to hedge yourself so you prosper no matter who wins?

10% of any winnings will go as tithe to my church, with the specific instruction that the money be used to feed and cloth the homeless people who stop by and clearly can't take care of themselves.

While it is a religious mission it isn't run by a specific church, just a bunch of Christians down there teaching medial diagnostic skills to the local population. I'll get more info about it when I get home and post it here.

You sound very confident with your assessment of Trump's chances. I recall Jeb! Bush being extremely confident of a similar assessment. I also recall Nate Silver saying: 
* "Trump will not make it past the first debate"
* "Trump will not make it to the first primary"
* "Trump will not win any primaries"
* "Trump will not win enough primaries to secure the nomination"
* "Trump will not win the presidency"
you sure you want to tie your wagon to that horse?

Looks like he's being fucked by the actions of his government and citizens more than bankers.

Now he's "CNN'S Morgan Spurlock"?
His documentaries contain about as much depth and accurate information as their coverage so he should fit right in with the rest of the shark sandwich.

Definitely not, Cruz ended his career the other night. I'm unsure what he should have done but I do know he shouldn't have been accepting donations up to 5 minutes before he endorsed Hillary, that's for certain.

Yea being a career politician who just sold out his constituents is very time consuming.
