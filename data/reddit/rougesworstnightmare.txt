Granted, I’m far from an economics major, but think about why you get up and go to work everyday. To get money (currency) to buy things. That’s why money is desirable. Why is bitcoin desirable if you can’t buy anything with it? I’m not bashing bitcoin it’s made some ok money and the community here is great just my 2 cents.

The gold argument is a very good point. But look at currency from a very basic perspective. Somethings only worth what someone will pay for it. If Walmart starts accepting toothpicks as currency than toothpicks have a ton more value. If no one uses bitcoin and no one accepts it where is the value from?

His name has vagina in it. I can only imagine a 12 year old snickering as he made his username...

I invested two months ago, it was only ten bucks which is nothing but I’m up 50%. Just shows what’s possible if I put in more!
