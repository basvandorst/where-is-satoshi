I have noticed that a number of Bitcoin and Ethereaum core developers and "insiders" are providing consulting services to big banks.  Is there a conflict of interests for them to do so?  Can we trust that they will still act in the best interest of public blockchain users instead of the banks?

It is investing. Saving is putting your money in bank's saving account and earning less than inflation rates.

It would not be prudent to give advises without knowing your family financial situations.  No investments should be viewed in isolation, but in the context of your family's entire net worth, existing assets, expected future income and expenses.  Even your health conditions matter because it affects your future cashflow over the next 30 years.
I suggest you see a fee-based (not commission-based) certified financial planner.

How about listing Bitcoin ETF in other countries?
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:27:11
Why not listing the ETF on an exchange outside the US?

It makes sense for stores at airports to accept crypto.  Banks makes a lot of money from exchange rate spreads and fees.  Crypto payments completely bypass that.

No amount of bitcoin can save your life from a crash.

The story keeps changing. You wonder how long this "official stand" will last.

No need.  It is always good to know or remind of the strong economic rationale for digital currencies like Bitcoin.  So the next time when we hear some other "experts" say Bitcoin is a a fad, we can recall what Milton Friedman said in 1999.

More accurate than technical analysis, or reading tea leaves.

So much geopolitical risk around the world.  The risk of another global market meltdown cannot be ignored.

Recently I came across this channel on Youtube.  The curated content is quite good. A shout out to the curator.  Some of my favorite videos include:
* "Bitcoin Beats All Major Currencies" - Bloomberg TV
* "Money &amp; Life" - Katie Teague Documentary
* "Bitcoin &amp; Currency Wars" - Andreas Antonopoulos
* "Money As Free Speech" - Andreas Antonopoulos

Apparently many Chinese bitcoin miners use excess electricity from local generators.   Those generators are unable to store or sell excess capacity to other towns/cities.  So their owners sell electricity at discount to local miners.

To be fair, those experts couldn't possibly anticipate that the governments of India and Venezuela would join the public relation team of Bitcoin in 2016. :)
A number of prominent economists like Kenneth Rogoff, Larry Summers, and Peter Sands think the US should phase out its largest $100 bills.  Apparently the majority of the $100 USD bills are circulated outside the US.  What would happen if the Fed announces that all the $100 USD bills must be exchanged for smaller bills in a certain number of days, as India did?

Nope. Not even in the past.

Another way to show: countries with nominal GDP less than Bitcoin market cap.

Near zero interest rates and QE cause huge distribution of wealth to from savers to asset owners.

Among all the major tech companies, only Microsoft has jumped into crypto with both feet. Since Satya Nadella became its CEO in Feb, 2014, Microsoft has become forward-thinking and innovative. 
As a long-time Mac user, I want to buy a Surface Studio desktop with that cool Surface Dial!

Can you program periodic payments in bitcoin wallet?

During the set up of my Casa Node, I entered my computer's IP address, not my Casa Node's IP address, to the Casa Node software.  The software doesn't give me an option to correct the IP address on the Bitcoin Manage Node page.
How can I give my correct IP address to the node software?
