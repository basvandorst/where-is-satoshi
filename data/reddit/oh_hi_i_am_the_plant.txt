Can somebody give some more advice?
* is the method explained in the tutorial a solid one?
* what do you do do once you have your paper wallets printed? (i don't have an android smartphone to scan the QR)
* Can i set up a watch only wallet or how do I verify? i don't want to store my wallets only to find out when i want to buy my island after 5 years i did something wrong.
* Do I make copies of the paper wallet?
* other layers of security possible? double authentication for example

this is very true, 
i'm in bitcoin a few years already but I still don't really  know how to buy them, Most of the times i found somebody on a forum who was willing to sell them via paypal or i found somebody on local bitcoin. now i finally can  buy them at coinbase. very promising

can't you just tell your customers to add a personal code in de comment field of bitcoin transfer? just like regular bank payments
edit: i was refering to this: 
but i guess that's just a blockchain.info option instead of a blockchain-protocol option?
multiple adresses sounds like the best option though, but i was wondering about this being usefull or not.

i think you should make a site because you have an idea and really want to do it, not because you happen to have a domain name.

the only purpose is security. 
which isn't a bad purpose.

can't you just tag your payment by using the comment box when you send coins? 
Can the buyers enter a personal code, just like normal bank payments?

you could laser in Plexi, works very well, engraved black plexi gives nice white characters.

if i have to make a deposit, there is always a code i have to add, like when i pay for internet or electricity: everybody makes his deposit on the same bank account no?
i don't see why it has to be different for bitcoin, can somebody explain?
