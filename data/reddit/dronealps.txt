I tried but it wasn't possible, at least not without modifying it. With the Raspberry Pi / Python, no mods are required.

Not yet implemented

Similar but this has a much smaller footprint (only 185 lines of code).

"look at the code, and work out if its randomness is sound."
How does the Trezor code compare to 185 lines used here?
The goal is to create the safest COLD STORAGE DEVICE. Spending functions are therefore of limited importance. If you want to spend your coins, you can use a separate device designed specifically for that purpose.

It might be trusted, but it cannot be verified. You have no idea if the keys can be trusted unless you can verify the creation method. Using dice to create the private key is the only way to know for sure that everything is safe.

Yes but most have complex code. This is only 185 lines.

That's why it's recommended to check carefully :) But you also have the WIF private key just in case :)

We are working on a "spending device" with a similar safety aspect (I.e. tiny python code and offline). Until this is released, you'll need to put your private key into software to spend, like Electrum.

It's offline, so can't be hacked! :)

Dice are random, and you know where the entropy comes from. You can literally see/verify the randomness with your own eyes. The same cannot be said for hardware randomness. You have to trust it blindly. Not good. 
Neither device has "access" to your private key. You keep it written down. It's not stored anywhere else.

That's why the Dice Cold Wallet exists - it has the Python script preloaded.

The randomness must be created by dice, not the device. Also, having 2 devices (one for creation, another for spending) is safer.
