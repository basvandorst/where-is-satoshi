Thank you! Yes! I have a [website]( And I have an [online store where I sell prints.]( I'm currently thinking of how to accept bitcoin on my online store. Probably through coinbase.

Thanks for the tip. I will see if it's even ok with the store's terms to post a link to bitcoin acceptance. It's through bigcartel and they run exclusively on paypal for art sales.

8x10ish inches, charcoal/pastel on paper, with hand-made floater frame, shipped in the US - price is anywhere between .90 bitcoin - 1 bitcoin. But that's just an estimate.

Yes there is. But dropping $10,000 via the red phone is scary as hell. It's nerve-wracking just doing a couple hundred. But you can. Go to CVS, head for the red phone. Follow the directions. Listen to what the operator tells you to do. Then pay at the register. Make sure you get a receipt!! Then wait for a confirmation email and with luck your funds will be deposited.

It's sort of negotiable. You got a pic you can PM me? It's kinda based on how complicated the image is and how long it takes me to do it. But anywhere from 0.065-0.1

I don't use BOA. Do you have to have a BOA account?

Thanks for your input. I am still absolutely clueless as to what ethereum is supposed to accomplish. ? You say it's "unfinished?"

Use Coinbase. Alot safer. It uses your bank account but it can take up to 3 or 4 days to be verified.

It'll be like a stampede trying to flee through a very tiny door.
