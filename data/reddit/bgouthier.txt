Wow, that's very helpful. Thank you. I guess I just don't really see why everyone is throwing money at BitCoin then, or other altcoins. Personally, I'm using it as a way to learn to play stocks so when I make enough I can invest in them. 
So I've read about some alliance that major companies such as Microsoft and the sort have made regarding BitCoin, could that make a standard for at least some of the major companies? Also, with all the altcoins (sorry if I'm not supposed to talk about those on here) how would one get picked to be the standard? Or would the major companies make their own and accept others as well?
Technically speaking, could a bank eventually be like okay, we'll act as a bank but with BitCoin? In essence act as a wallet with extremely high security for everyone and then turn around and use our money to make more money through loans and investing and such? I know that's the opposite of what BitCoin was created to do, but it seems like it would inevitably happen if it did ever start to get mainstream attraction.
Lastly, do you possibly have some links to reliable sources to read up on these issues, or YouTube channels, or anything even remotely related in an economical sense to all this? I have been reading and watching for a few weeks now but it's hard to narrow down material and then even know if its trustworthy. 
Thank so much for the help!
