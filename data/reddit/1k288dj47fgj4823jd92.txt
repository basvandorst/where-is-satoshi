Quick, someone make a shitcoin called "Bircoin" with a supply of one and a bidder at 1,000,000!
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:01:28
 Thanks, that makes sense.

You will literally never, ever, mine a full Bitcoin using your Android app.

Backdoor in Ledger or a backdoor in Trezor.

What's your age and strategy?

Have you read that Privacy Policy?  Disgusting.

Support to withdraw, not support to buy.

Poloniex is shady.  I would not use, myself.

Bitsquare is the best, no doubt, it just needs more users.

These circles are not even proportionate.  This is a terrible image.

I wish you could buy this, pre-built, off Amazon.  I would be all over it.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:06:28
This is the solution I think I want... can you tell me about this?  Any guides out there?
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:28:48
I know it was likely unintentional, but I am not seeing any unequivocal, "we will not share your data with anyone" posts from the creator yet...
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:19:17
How do you store information and what is your privacy policy?
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:38:10
Also, you just said you don't not use any of the information to benefit yourselves.  So you just said that you use the information to benefit yourselves.

Fair enough - my sharp response is deleted.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:43:51
I want to know that it is stored securely and won't be sold.
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:39:41
Thanks for this.  My lingering question is "whose" clock?  Who is, "it's"?
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:56:13
Are you 16 tho?
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:18:38
But are you 16?
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:51:11
But what if a group of Bitcoin miners/nodes decided to modify the time (either into the past, or into the future)?
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:30:45
"But what if a..."

If BTC is up x10 - nobody will "cash out".  They will spend the BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:35:27
That is a goddamn dusty transaction!
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:16:29
I'm not saying this has been done, or will be, just asking a question, but here, take a downvote.
