Like 9 days ago also hahah. From 8-17 and now a stable 15 in just 9 days. I said above and will say it again. He’s probably only seen these bull runs and polluting this space with trash.

He’s probably only seen only the recent crazy bull runs and saying this.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Bitcoin. The fluctuations are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical accounting most of the bull runs will go over a typical investors head. There's also Ethers nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into its source code- it’s personal philosophy draws heavily from Satoshi literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these fluctuations, to realise that they're not just spikes or bubbles- they say something deep about Fiat. As a consequence people who dislike BTC truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in the existential catchphrase "HODL" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenevs Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Satoshi's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. ��
And yes, by the way, i DO have a BTC tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ��
