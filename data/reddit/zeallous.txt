lol again it's all PR

TC mentioned there is a small catch i.e. a small tweak needed in the bitcoin blockchain, what's the change needed?
@_date: 2015-06-12 17:50:15
Wow thanks for the reply. I can already imagine the potential. Hard to see other alternative blockchains building the feat as staggering as this. *ahem ripple*
@_date: 2014-09-08 01:21:28
OpenBazaar going mainstream!
@_date: 2014-09-04 09:21:50
They can't blame the Chinese (because it's what we do best), so they blame their own citizens! haha 
Conclusion: Fed is here to steal money. Savings makes them super annoyed

Also in Hong Kong, if anyone has any expertise on it.
@_date: 2014-09-11 07:22:03
This is very good to know.

Every large company seems to be only "testing" payments. even paypal. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 10:33:20
haha nice one .... because it really looks like too true...that it looks like a great bluff.haha
@_date: 2014-10-12 23:47:30
That's why it's important people start embracing this. Right now it's the consumers that are pushing the merchants to accept bitcoin. Most actually do accept, but unconsciousness they just say "no" for convenience sake.
@_date: 2014-10-12 23:46:30
did you follow the video mentioned in the post?
@_date: 2014-05-04 15:34:19
you just need a crap android phone, wifi connection, and a sim to get you SMS functionality. That's it. Just make sure android is 3.0+.
CoinPip is going to look for SMS Gateway Partners soon. Keep you guys posted! :)

So why do people still push for twice the block size when this does the job?
@_date: 2016-11-27 05:02:04
So is the premise of this post 1btc per person?? Lol
@_date: 2015-08-17 16:08:57
We know that. This is a no brainer. But the fact is there will be one, so I just wanna know how bad is it that's all.
@_date: 2019-06-04 17:01:19
I still dont quite understand lightning. Fast yes, centralized yes...what else
@_date: 2015-08-17 16:08:24
So comparing this with the bitLicense, this still offers room for innovation? I mean, from the tone... it sounds like it's a bit more accommodating 
@_date: 2015-04-23 04:39:51
Even if Greece adopts bitcoin, how are they going to get enough of them? Even if they don't, pegging the drachma to it also might not be be perfect idea.

Rand is trying EVERYTHING he can to get elected. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 06:09:53
Im not sure how to read this. some pointers would be good.
@_date: 2016-10-26 08:03:04
i don't know why when i send out transactions, it says its a double spend. do i just have wait til everything is confirmed (even if there's still surplus in the wallet) before i do anything.
all started with a 0.5btc sent and says its a low fee transfer (0.000129) and everything is stuck..
@_date: 2016-10-26 04:10:16
No the bitcoin confirmations is very slow. I do my regular transactions to regular recipients. This time its taking over 10 hours and still not verified.
I've increased the fees to 0.0005 now. but its still very slow. What are you guys paying?
@_date: 2016-10-26 04:10:59
haha i don't think 0.08 is enough. im paying 0.0005btc and its still slow.
@_date: 2015-03-14 18:33:24
This article is actually being sarcastic about SWIFT. Sorry for the confusion :)
@_date: 2013-12-27 14:03:46
Then what's good about coinbase? seems like a lot of people are pretty much anti coinbase. Where they gonna use their 25Mil on? Marketing!?
@_date: 2013-12-30 13:35:48
This is awesome! thanks for this
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:41:53
haha great opportunity to get people to know about bitcoins haha
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:48:39
So what basis is the indian govt clamping down the exchanges with? Sorry I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
@_date: 2013-12-28 09:46:22
hahah that's the Chinese system! Western system is innocent until proven guilty. Chinese system is guilty until proven innocent. Indian system should be the western system if I'm not wrong?
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:53:01
Haha if only it was more HD
@_date: 2013-12-31 10:05:12
obvious that i'm not talking about current prices right? And I did mention companies as well. Otherwise how can companies like Wikileaks survive :)
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:11:01
This is great, I hope ASEAN as a region will follow
@_date: 2013-12-24 09:47:47
wow this is important stuff. thanks
@_date: 2013-12-24 09:48:40
yeh, this argument should apply to Google....but it doesn't tho. I don't see Apple as a super risk adversed company. They are the largest startup!
@_date: 2013-12-31 10:09:05
Didn't they get the memo from the chinese govt?!
@_date: 2013-12-30 13:09:12
ok I'm sorry I'll delete this and re-write the headline again.
@_date: 2013-12-24 13:57:10
Sometimes you don't just want to sell to people you know right? Obviously not to scammers... 
but like...was it hard building the relationships? Was it more natural for you to trade online or trade cash?
@_date: 2013-12-30 13:28:11
so did someone start a petition for this already?
@_date: 2013-12-25 11:13:42
I see. So it's mainly a counterparty risk issue and that there are no real stats for cash transactions, thats the main thing right?
@_date: 2013-12-28 02:29:08
The assumption is windows 8 is for the masses.. But never the less...great!
@_date: 2013-12-24 08:29:21
Ok, I'll keep this in mind. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-28 13:02:09
Apple is a state of its own
@_date: 2013-12-24 08:20:48
So you're saying, if say Germany. I launch a bitcoin app there where it is now fully legal, Apple will allow it on their app store?
@_date: 2013-12-24 08:29:07
this is what i think too!
@_date: 2013-12-24 08:22:52
Hmm, somehow my reply didn't get submitted. I'll submit again.
Apple should be at the forefront with the laws and for them to be unsure like any laymen is really an excuse. Or are they up to something? They should be more worried than all of us due to their huge savings in USD. I thought they would understand from that perspective.
From what I know, if a new law is set, governments will give companies leeway to fix their business processes and uphold the new laws.
@_date: 2013-12-28 02:30:27
"They believe" is not enough for a legal clamp down. "I believe" you're a killer so I go arrest you....I can't do that right? So I'm just asking, on what basis are they clamping down on
