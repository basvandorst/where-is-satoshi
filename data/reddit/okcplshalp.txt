How exactly are poor people going get into forex trading? Take out a loan (on bad or no credit) and risk becoming even poorer? Easy there Mother Teresa. 


There is no implication in my statement that you need the green light, or that I was giving you the green light. Why do you think I was giving you the green light?


It was a motivational statement I've heard before. I tailored it to our conversation. The point was that sometimes good ideas face ridicule, and people just have to keep chugging along and ignore the ridicule.

When the alt coin bubble bursts it's going to make for a great day of staring at charts.

I think this has already happened. I would be very careful using public wifi, like in coffee shops, if I lived somewhere like SF.

My problem with other cryptos is that none of the other ones have anonymous founders who haven't made any money off the launch of the new crypto. 
If you were to subtract bitcoin from history, and try to sell me a currency you made, that you're starting with a bunch of, I would laugh at you. The only reason I took bitcoin seriously is because of what satoshi did with all the bitcoins he had: nothing. 
Bcash is even worse than most of the others. You have a guy who has a lot of bitcoin, selling me a clone of bitcoin with a minor change (pun intended), that he happens to start with some crazy amount of? That's not fair at all, and to make things worse, every bitcoin holder started with Bcash for free. So anyone trying to sell me Bcash can literally go fuck themselves, I'm not stupid. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:26:11
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:26:20
A vast majority of people who have the chance to make a billion dollars from nothing will take it, so I think it's pretty safe to say at this point satoshi is either gone forever, or is not willing to cash in the coins based on priniciple, because satoshi knows how bad it would make bitcoin look to have a founder profiting off the currency they made, you know, like all the alt coin founders ARE doing without question. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:13:56
My financial guy said about the same. I got him interested in bitcoin, and he said he was handcuffed and couldn't really give me advice on buying/selling, but to just hold on to what I have, because it may be the one asset I have that makes me rich one day.

The internet of money. 
Essentially it all boils down to: Every bitcoin has millions of potential inputs onto an immutable, verifiable public ledger. 
What those inputs are used for, I don't know. 
I see bitcoin being the internet of money. I see people exchanging stocks and other assets like how we send emails today. 
I also see bitcoin coexisting with fiat money, and I agree with AA in regards to there being hundreds of thousands of altcoins, but only a few with actual economic value. 


People *are* using it as a currency. I don't understand why people keep sticking their fingers in their ears, closing their eyes, and repeating this notion that nobody spends it. People spend it, especially people who value freedom to the point where they want to see bitcoin succeed, and don't mind missing out on potential profits to support freedom, and bitcoin's overall success.

This will lead to more people researching crypto, and get a few more people redpilled on how they're getting fucked by central banks. Finding out you're getting fucked by central banks leads to people wanting to fuck back, bitcoin could very well wind up being a nice tool for fucking back.

Doing it overtly would have made it seem as though they had a profit incentivized motive in preventing segwit implementation. Doing it covertly allowed them to maintain the boost in profit and allowed them to maintain a white-night reputation in the 'scaling debate' because having a better reputation reduced how much they were scrutinized. It also gave them plausible deniability in regards to their nefarious motives/actions. They were free to pump shitcoins, sell fake bitcoins, manipulate markets, and have a hashing rate advantage. Thow in the Roger Ver wildcard and it really made for a stressful time for me, and many others.

It was an if/then statement, but yeah, might be good to spend $200 on a consultation anyway.

I think it's more like 'let the developers do their hobby that they're quite passionate about', but I get what you mean.
