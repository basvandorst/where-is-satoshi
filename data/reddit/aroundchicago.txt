Could you please explain how Lightning network accomplishes this?
As a Lightning user it makes more sense to create channels with large nodes since they would have enough capital for me to make payments through. Also since large nodes are connected to more nodes in the network, fewer hops are needed for my payment to get to the end destination (and thus lower fees).
For these reasons users are incentivized to connect to large nodes which creates a degree of centralization.
So the answer to the question is that LN incentivizes nodes to remain small because the funds for a node are stored in a hot wallet. This incentivizes the node owner to limit the funds of their node in the event that they are stolen. This was the best reasoning I could find but it has me wondering - why would anyone want to run a node if there was even a tiny risk of losing their funds?

There were [236,609 transactions]( on the 29 Jan. 
There are 86,400 seconds in a day.
236,600 / 86,400 = 2.738 transactions per second. I have no idea were you're getting this 20 trans / sec number.

And you know why? *People have stopped transacting with Bitcoin*
They got burned by high fees once and they're not going to make the same mistake again. 
And it's not because of transaction batching - the number of *outputs* per block is [declining]( at the same rate as the number of transactions per block. If batching was significant I would expect transactions/block to go down while outputs/block would go up
EDIT: graph is for outputs *per block* not per day - my mistake. However the 7 day average is much lower than the 30 day average (793356 outputs vs 593141 outputs) showing a downward trend.

No - it's more like setting up a McDonalds right across the street which sells better burgers for a cheaper price. Not to mention the fries are crispy yet fluffy on the inside and the chicken nuggets are moist and tender. Plus all the dipping sauces you want.

Segwit adoption has been stagnant for a while now. It's fluctuated [between 10% and 14% for most of the time its been active](
However the volume of transactions has [decreased to 2015/16 levels]( in the past week or so.

Problem is nobody is going to use the LN for micro-payments if there's a large cost to opening a channel. It kinda defeats its purpose.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:33:50
Thank you! Your second paragraph cleared things up for me. What I didn't understand was that you don't really need to have channels with every shop you use as long as those shops have channels with each other. 
This video from the Lightning devs also cleared up lots

This makes no sense. How does insider trading have anything to do with BCH itself? It doesn't. You're grasping at straws to find *something* to complain about. 
The crypto market is largely unregulated. By trading crypto you except these terms and conditions. If you wanna complain maybe complain about Tether pumping millions of unverified dollars into BTC...
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:42:55
Technically speaking why is a Segwit transaction cheaper than a normal one? 
Are segwit transactions prioritized over normal ones? Is there a separate mem-pool for segwit transactions?
For extra credit: if every single transaction was a segwit transaction would fees decrease significantly? It seems like the only reason that segwit fees are cheaper atm is because there's much fewer of them.

As with any project there are leaders and there are followers. Right now Bitcoin ABC is leading the Bitcoin Cash protocol but that doesn't mean it's forever gonna be like this. If you don't think there's peer reviews and cross team discussions happening behind the scenes then you have no idea how modern software development works. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 16:18:12
None of these implementations have a say on the direction of the Bitcoin protocol. Some of these like btcd are just porting the C++ Bitcoin Core implementation over to Golang. However implementations like Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin Unlimited both have influence over the Bitcoin Cash protocol making them different from the ones you mentioned.
I'm sure the Bitcoin ABC team scheduled this upgrade after discussing it with other BCH teams. And this was announced _months_ before the May 15 date to give other dev teams plenty of time to prepare.

Now I know you're full of it - the [github page]( tells a very different story


Jesus this is painful to read. You can absolutely measure adoption [using outputs]( The data doesn't lie - Bitcoin's outputs/day was trending upward until the plague of high fees came thru at the end of last year causing merchants to drop support.


Dogecoin was started more than 4 years ago. Bitcoin Cash is less than a year old. The fact that BCH has a similar number of transactions as DOGE is impressive. 


The number of transactions on the LN is a drop in the bucket. Until the LN is fully capable it will remain insignificant. 


Bitcoin doesn't have **a** leader - it has leader**s**. Every coordinated effort in existence has one and can't function without one. That doesn't mean that there needs to be one glorious leader that we follow until the end of time. That means that _someone_ has to take the initiative and step up every so often. In the BCH community this is Bitcoin ABC at the present moment but could be someone else in the future. 
It's ironic that core supporters support decentralization more than any other aspect but can't seem to notice that the development of their beloved protocol is in itself centralized. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 15:53:42
Bitcoin ABC is one of many implementations of Bitcoin Cash. Listing it as "Bitcoin ABC (BCH)" is incorrect cause the Bitcoin ABC team does not have absolute authority for what goes into the Bitcoin Cash protocol. 
However Bitcoin Core is the _only_ implementation and therefore has final word for what goes into the Bitcoin protocol. So listing it as "Bitcoin Core (BTC)", while inconsistent with the rest of the list, is not wrong. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 17:02:02


So by this logic people like Gavin Andresen and Vitalik Buterin don't write good code? They disagreed with the Bitcoin Core vision and as a result got pushed out. 


All these people should be furious with the direction of Bitcoin - adoption, outputs, and transactions are the lowest they've been in a long time. Clearly something is wrong with Bitcoin's current vision. 


Like any project there are leaders and there are followers. Just because one team set the date doesn't mean there wasn't peer reviews and cross team discussions happening behind the scenes. Please share how you think consensus should work in a open source decentralized environment. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 15:36:45
Bitcoin Core is the _only_ implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. Therefore listing "Bitcoin Core" next to "BTC" makes sense cause the Bitcoin Core team has the only say on what goes into the Bitcoin protocol. 
However Bitcoin Cash has several implementations (BitcoinABC, Bitcoin Unlimited, etc) and involves a collaboration across different teams. No one team makes the final decisions. Therefore listing for example "BitcoinABC" next to "BCH" is incorrect because it's only one of many implementations.
edit: and by _only_ I mean it's the only implementation that can meaningfully impact the underlying Bitcoin protocol. Mirror implementations like btcd do not impact the protocol - it's porting the Bitcoin Core implementation to other languages
@_date: 2018-05-01 16:22:33
Bitcoin Core is the only one that truly matters - it's the one that calls  the shots and makes all the decisions on changes to the protocol. 
Other implementations are just following suite - many are just porting the Bitcoin Core implementation over to other languages. They do not influence the Bitcoin protocol in the same way that Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin ABC influence the Bitcoin Cash protocol.

Until the mempool gets huge, fees go up, transaction times go up and the cycle repeats. The problem with this is businesses don't want to use a payment system that works reliably every other month.
*What's clear now is that users will use Bitcoin if the fees are reasonable*. How many cycles do you think it'll take before enough users either switch to other cryptos or stop all together?
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:09:35
LN has a small use case where it truly shines - microtransactions. Now considering that there are very few businesses currently using these types of transactions, I fail to see how the LN can have a meaningful impact. In fact for normal transactions LN will make matters worse because it doubles the number of transactions necessary unless you want your funds tied up. A lose-lose situation.
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:04:17
I suppose one is a metric of throughput - the other is a metric of demand. 
It's gone up to 41 as I type this. It's also why the mempool has reversed its downward trend. I guess it's that time of the month again for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-21 04:20:46
Apparently there is a [LN implementation]( that doesn't need you to run a full node to run a LN node since it connects to other full nodes on the network. 
However it looks like you must run a LN node to receive lightning payments atm.

I forgot one! 
One has a community that counters dissenting opinions with facts - the other blindly shills for their supreme coin!

I recently read an interesting article on [Why is Bitcoin Valuable?]( He hits a lot of the points you mention and goes into depth on why crypto is bringing "democracy" to our monetary system 
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:40:43
Segwit has failed _so far_. It's had [stagnant adoption]( in the last few months. I'm sure Coinbase implementing segwit will help in this regard but this doesn't change the fact that [less people are using Bitcoin in general]( So implementing segwit next week won't have the huge impact it would have had last month.
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:44:11
One of the main arguments for Segwit was that it was a soft fork. It was chosen over raising the block size because that involves a hard fork. Core devs convinced the community that hard forks are the worst thing since smallpox and thus Segwit happened. 
My point is that soft forks can cause big problems as well. We had to wait 7 months for major players to finally catch on and Bitcoin has paid a huge price for it.

This is like saying the internet of 1987 is inferior to the highly advanced VISA payment network of 2018. Of course *today's* blockchains can't scale very well - there's a lot of research and development to be done before VISA level volume can be done on-chain. 
But as the [article]( demonstrates - blocks sizes can be raised to 100mb and still run on standard nodes (that's three times Paypal scale). 
Developing VISA scale solutions for Bitcoin at the moment is like trying to train a toddler to run a marathon. Bitcoin *doesn't need* and *is not ready* for these solutions yet. Maybe after Bitcoin gets a solid footing and starts walking on its own - solutions like the LN can be brought in successfully. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:17:27


Can you go into more detail about this? Blockchains get more secure as more blocks are added. If all nodes stored the last 100 blocks (10gb max if block size limit is 100mb) this is more than enough security. You would need an absurd amount of hashing power to re-write blocks with 100+ confirmations. 
In terms of block propagation the article also addresses this


It's reasonable to make the assumption that when we get to 100mb block scale - block compression will be standard. A 50mbps connection would have no problem propagating compressed blocks.
@_date: 2018-03-10 06:19:12
One has near zero fees and fast confirmation times (and has maintained these traits at high volume) - the other doesn't
One has a clear cut and tested plan for scaling - the other doesn't
One has a decentralized development strategy - the other doesn't
One strives to be usable by the richest and poorest of us - the other doesn't
I'll let you draw your own conclusions of which one better serves the purpose of a "peer-to-peer electronic cash system"
 
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:05:47
Lets say the current block number is N. It was my understanding that to rewrite block N-100 you first need to re-write block N, N-1, N-2, N-3, etc all the way thru block N-100. Since all nodes verify the latest 100 blocks than rewriting the blocks necessary to get to block N-100 is difficult enough to keep the entire blockchain secure. Is this incorrect?
2% almost seems like a ridiculous number although a new protocol called [Graphene]( can "encode information in about 10% of the space of Compact Blocks [BIP152]" . I'm no expert on this myself, but it's exciting to hear that these problems are being researched and could make it into mainline sooner than you think!
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:50:04


This is where I see LN's largest hurdle - adoption. Most businesses haven't heard of Bitcoin, much less run a Bitcoin node. Now you want them to _also_ run a LN node? It just seems like way to big of a gap to cross atm.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:58:55


It's hard to argue that some businesses will help with adoption more than others. What I mean here is that day to day transactions nowadays (grocery shopping, buying games on steam, etc) won't overly benefit from microtransactions significantly more than they would from normal transactions. Since the barrier to entry for accepting normal transactions (running a crypto node) is lower than accepting LN transactions (running a BTC node _and_ running a LN node) there's no incentive for them to put in the extra effort when they reach the former.
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:08:41
10$ please ;)
Oh I know development takes time - especially with features as complex as Segwit. History has shown that soft forks are not always a good idea especially when the performance of your application so heavily depends on it. Who made that development decision?
