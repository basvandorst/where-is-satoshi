Just shows there just arnt enough decimal places in btc. Need to offchain fractional satoshi, especially when btc goes to 100million usd per coin

Both sides are guilty of unethical behaviour. Get over it

Sorry friend, it couldn't be recovered and the coins are lost.... :)

Don't provide anything to them.
The terms of the site may mean you "have" to tell them, but i really doubt they will chase you.

Lightning network works well ?? Really?

Ask him to refer you for a job at Amazon aswell

ETH, BCH, XMR
The usual suspects
@_date: 2018-06-02 11:27:36
A couple of years and ETH will be ready. BTC perhaps a little longer because of all the politics, but together they will be unstoppable.

What is this originally from?

Crowdsourced infinite knowledge!!
@_date: 2019-10-16 05:59:30
I don't believe it. Share the law please
@_date: 2018-06-02 22:54:51
Ofcourse politics impacts developments. Lots of devs have left bitcoin because of all the garbage politics

Court is a court, I would hardly call it proof

The cost for a full node will not increase as much as you think. As time passes the cloud company will give more storage and resources for the same price
@_date: 2019-10-16 11:22:04
Exactly my point. Nothing is so clear cut, and the world does not follow usa law
@_date: 2019-10-16 10:15:57
So I can't give assets to a baby? 
The whole statement is full of holes

Trading on inside information. Access to fed policy before the public etc
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:27:52
fantastic :)

"failed" : - )
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:15:59
Probably ok to use for a quick trade, just don't keep much on there at a time.

Annual is ok, monthly is when we all have to panic : - )

The best comment here

Not mining segwit transactions is a good thing
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:17:59
I dont think they have still released the details of the last hack?
@_date: 2019-12-22 06:14:32
Mastering bitcoin. Easy read, just ignore the programming bits
@_date: 2019-12-29 12:02:32
Kraken is best for uk. Coinbase is second
@_date: 2019-12-26 17:09:31
And you think he wasn't taking money from ico projects to advertise for them?
@_date: 2019-12-22 06:16:06
Kraken is the best for European as they have great euro support
@_date: 2019-12-21 16:16:43
Regtest does not have block explorers. Testnet is the way to go once you need it.
@_date: 2019-12-21 16:18:12
If... even then I don't think you are right as new people means loads of new channels being opened.
@_date: 2019-12-29 01:14:25
Low fee means less demand for block space. This is a bad thing as it means less people are using btc
@_date: 2019-04-22 16:24:24
I would prefer the shiny bars

A tech upgrade which was used as a political football to divide the community more than it already was.
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:57:32
Cut the block size or we will just be filing blocks with spam 
@_date: 2018-04-08 07:48:25
1% isnt that bad if you are doing small buys.
Circle used to do zero fees but took around 1% on the rate, and that was good for a debit card fiat onramp.
@_date: 2018-04-20 12:10:40
The fact people can borrow what they dont have is why the prices are so high.
@_date: 2019-05-11 14:24:33
How do you define spam?
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:38:37
This is not relevant, we are talking about usage here.  Or are you saying if ethereum didn't change their emission rate then they would have even more transactions? 
Let's stay on topic
@_date: 2019-05-11 14:30:20
Perhaps that is right, or perhaps people have moved their business to other blockchains, hence less activity on bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-11 15:14:53
Absolute rubbish sorry. Ethereum is what is it, just like bitcoin is what it is.
If you don't feel people are transaction as currency on ethereum or monero then you should take another look.
@_date: 2018-04-08 07:36:36
It still is a get rich quick scheme !!
@_date: 2019-05-11 14:49:08
I put it vaguely as i don't know for sure :-)
But ethereum has loads of transactions everyday, and i presume others do aswell.
