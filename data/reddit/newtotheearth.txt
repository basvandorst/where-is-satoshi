I don't think you understand the seriousness of a hard fork.  A solid consensus is required for a successful and smooth transition.


Those are the questions that need to be deliberated upon and thoughtfully answered.  The hasty decision that you are desiring is not prudent in this case.

Do you have an update on your withdrawal attempts?
@_date: 2015-12-22 02:20:55
I'm having a similar experience.  I withdrew 0.1 LTC successfully, after 5 hours pending.  Since that worked, I thought everything was ok.  So I tried withdrawing all my LTC, over 100, and now it's been pending for almost 24 hours.  Your experience is making me even more nervous that I might not see that LTC again.
What had been working, and I should have stuck to it, is converting whatever altcoin to DOGE, by way of BTC.  So, altcoin -&gt; BTC -&gt; DOGE and then withdraw the DOGE in small chunks.  My largest chunk was about .4 BTC worth of DOGE.  It would be in pending for about 10 minutes, so was relatively convenient to withdraw a small chunk of DOGE, wait for it to be received and then withdraw another small chunk.  Over and over until I get everything out.
While this is the best way, that I've found, to get coins out of Cryptsy, there is a cost in the fact that, on the Cryptsy exchange, DOGE costs about 33% more than on other exchanges.  So, in essence, this method has a 33% fee.

It's not really politicizing.  Contrary to how everybody is treating this, it is a *general* policy, applicable to *all* hard forks.  The current block size debate simply exposed the need for the policy.  A large portion of its value is that it provides relatively firm guidance on how Bitcoin.org will be behave under certain circumstances.

Is there any value to finding out, in a real world scenario, exactly what happens when the block size starts bumping against the limit?  If there is value in this information, why not find out now, while Bitcoin is still in its Mickey Mouse phase?
The worst case scenario doesn't sound too bad.

Your bitcoin do not exist in your home, they exist on the blockchain.  Your *access* to your bitcoin, however, may exist within your home.  If you had an off-site safety deposit box, only accessible by key, and your keys were stolen from your house, would homeowner's insurance cover the contents of your safety deposit box?

It's there, if you just read a little further.
In the headline, "after" only refers redundantly to the price increase, essentially saying, 'Bitcoin passes $300 after price increase'.  "In wake of" refers is referring to the temporal relationship between the price increase and the VAT ruling.

It's interesting because if we assume that the guy is perfectly amoral and self-interested, the end game seems to hinge on the success of mcxNOW as a business.  If it is successful as a business/exchange, it likely would be more profitable to continue the business.  If, as a business, it fails or is simply mediocre, then "cashing out" by stealing the deposits and disappearing would most profitable.

That is the key issue, regardless of what is beyond their control and how backed up they are.
