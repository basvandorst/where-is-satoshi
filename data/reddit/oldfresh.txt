Thank you for your reply; I’m not interested in assigning blame, and I can only speak for myself. I’m most interested in the long-term profitability and success of bitcoin. I do not presently see any serious attempt to have a hard-fork (long-term technical debt avoidance) that includes SegWit along with a blocksize increase that is ready for deployment shortly after a soft-fork for SegWit. 
I’ve read that others fear that Bitcoin governance is dominated by one private US company (Blockstream) and so some miners wish to have a more active role in governance via BU. I hope and believe such rumors are false and the community can stick together and work together.

Thank you for your reply, I would argue the spirit of the agreement was not upheld and so there is a stand off. Compromise from 8mb to 2mb hard-fork has been rejected and I choose to reject SegWit soft-fork until the community can work together instead of only one group getting 100% of what it wants. Bitcoin is supported by many and we should want to keep it that way. It is not just a research project and sandbox for developers. The chain must be developed AND secured via Pow, let us work together to do both. Write code that miners feel is worth securing and we will do so in our own interest.

Miner here, I feel burned by the HK consensus. Trust is earned not demanded.

Well said, but I fear it will fall on deaf ears who would rather see their baby cut in half than admit their governance has failed.

Cool, so chain split in a few months then, enjoy the ride :)

If this happens I guarantee there will be a chain split; I will be splitting off with BU the true Bitcoin, not bank coin where users are forced off chain, leaving just large institutions on chain.

Sure let losers use secondary layers, but if your transaction is not on chain you might as well use PayPal. The real players know that and will jump ship to a bitcoin that actually works for them.

Validate what? Without larger blocks users won't get to have their transactions on chain.

Buckle up bitch you're in for a ride, I have a lot of coins and a lot of hashing power, and I along with my allies will destroy your shit coin.

It's also the fastest way to a chain split, and guess which side is going to have more hashing power... just sayin

If your transaction is not on chain you might as well use fucking PayPal. So sure let chumps use the scam layers, but leave the chain big enough for the real players to stay interested.
