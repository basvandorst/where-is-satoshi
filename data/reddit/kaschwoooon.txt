a market on acid for hackers on steroids!

How much is $1 million in blockchains?
@_date: 2014-12-23 18:40:45
yes yes

I always think of pineapples when I see this guy.

Will more transactions fit into a block if everybody uses dynamic fees?
Would dynamic fees still be reliable if everybody uses them?

Confrontational ideas can be very dangerous, I hope the mod team keeps providing a safe space for normal users while the experts figure out the best way to proceed.
@_date: 2016-03-16 19:17:13
Same here, goes to show how unbelievably more efficient everything could be, humanity needs cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2016-03-10 07:56:18
Reality disagrees, bitcoin started with 100% market share and now its below 80%.
The block size drama is a nice catalyst for diversification.
@_date: 2016-01-21 18:22:44
It's you who does not understand, can kicking is exactly what is needed until tps hit hard limits and not artificial ones.
Bitcoin is not in a vacuum, it does not have a monopoly, it has to compete and keep growing or competitors will spring up and satisfy the ignored demand.
I guess without this uncertainty bitcoin would be in bubble mode already.
Maybe the badger has to dump on some fools to keep it real.

Backpeddling much?
Strongly decrying something looks different imho.
@_date: 2016-01-22 18:24:40
People only have 2 options, voice and exit.
Guess what they will do next if core devs don't stop playing central bankers 2.0.

Perpetual motion machine was malfunctioning.
@_date: 2016-03-25 20:23:31
Big move ahead.
@_date: 2016-01-22 19:46:48
Thanks darling, just stating my opinion, the market will decide anyway.
As long as there is room enough for continued growth between the average block size and the limit it's not a perfect but a practical enough solution.
I would much prefer core doing it.
Who knows how people react to a fork to classic, maybe dogecoin gets the glory?
The growth will happen somewhere.

Good luck with socialism or even democracy for that matter when everybody has a swiss bank account in their pocket.
@_date: 2016-01-30 08:21:48
What about the block reward?
I always thought it's intention is to subsidise growth by making transactions cheaper, adding more users and in return making the whole network more valuable.
Now if we don't want on-chain transactions to grow anymore, whats the point of the block reward?
Subsidise rent seeking toll trolls?

@_date: 2016-02-01 12:58:14
It's in their self interest to get more transactions on chain and collect the fees on it, I'm surprised they don't push for a block limit increase harder actually.
@_date: 2016-02-24 11:45:38
Yeah, I actually believe a network gets more valuable with more participants and a higher rate of information exchange.
If that stops being the case it just stops growing, no central planning needed.
@_date: 2016-02-01 21:08:38
If a fork happens because the market demands it then it's just the protocol working as intended and I would BTFD.
Bitcoin is still mostly used as a store of value and people hodling naturally want returns for taking on the risks.
Hodlers get those returns when the network gets more valuable, it gets more valuable by growing, so there are huge growth expectations. Thats the positive feedback loop satoshi talked about.
If those expectations are continuously met by a brick wall then that could cause a price drop.
Inaction carries risks and there is no guaranteed recovery if we let bitcoin drop now and then decide to raise limits later, it may be too late and bitcoin becomes crypto-myspace, positive feedback loops can turn negative.
@_date: 2016-02-01 20:33:18
So we need the block size limit because otherwise transactions would cost nothing and then people will be happy to use lightning because it reduces their fees, which actually could be 0 according to you.
I don't know man.
@_date: 2016-02-01 19:38:42
Thats only true if you assume that transactions are free when there is no block size limit, which they are not, even if you pay nothing there is an opportunity cost for the miner to include your transaction.    On the other hand people wouldn't pay thousands of dollars to transact if you made the block size limit 500 bytes, they would just leave and bitcoins value would collapse.    There is a balance and it's for the market to find out.
If lightning provides value it will gain traction on it's own merit, forcing it on people won't work.
@_date: 2016-02-07 14:30:31
Let them eat cake.
@_date: 2016-02-01 20:24:56
Thats a good question.    The market price to transact may also get smaller if the block size isn't raised.    I think the revenue will be higher in USD terms because a network with more users is more valuable.
If bitcoin demands too high of a fee in relation to the utility it provides users would be incentivized to switch to a competitor.
@_date: 2016-02-24 12:23:00
Yes I agree, but why would I participate if I can't use it to transact because limits are reached or my use case is outpriced?
Why not use another network then?
Trying to artificially limit capacity and bump up fees will just alienate users and strengthen the use case for competitors exactly because bitcoin does not have a monopoly.
@_date: 2016-02-04 20:07:39
Whats the use case for bitcoin if you are just interested in buying everyday goods right now? You have a huge barrier of entry and no consumer protection. You gain pseudonymity.
People would go for it if they could save 3-10% everywhere using bitcoin. Companies would have to pass on their savings from accepting bitcoin to the customers.
@_date: 2016-02-24 10:30:09
Because the cryptocurrency market is not decentralized enough, bitcoin still has a market share of ~85% so we have to incentivize users to use other coins for more decentralization, also don't forget about the lightning network!
@_date: 2016-02-24 12:53:15
Yes but that changes the value proposition of bitcoin completely, for the worse in my opinion.
The blocksize limit is not a constant, it's a variable and should be determined by the market and not a group of experts, I think thats where we disagree and I will leave it at that.
@_date: 2015-07-21 14:28:15
Looks good. Maybe add an optional admin password to change security settings, like okcoin has it.

@_date: 2016-02-01 13:28:32
More fees are more fees. More transactions result in higher utility and a higher value for bitcoin. Bitcoin not allowing growth means users may go somewhere else where all this shiny miner equipment may be useless. Not growing is a risk without a gain for them, I think they just would prefer core making the call to not shake up confidence.
@_date: 2016-02-14 16:51:09
Bitcoin brand is so strong it might as well have a monopoly.
If thats not enough we just ban selling, problem solved.

People voting with their feet is not a democracy, it's the market.
@_date: 2016-02-24 10:57:56
The utility, opportunities and overall value grows exponentially too, maybe the people finding a better solution haven't even heard of bitcoin yet.
It's a bit early to defend the status quo.
@_date: 2015-11-06 17:14:55
If Bitcoin is able to grow beyond a boutique currency and reach global ubiquity, it won.
The bigger risk is the hammer coming down before that and not scaling quickly enough imho.
