A full node is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks. Almost all full nodes also help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other full nodes, validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to further full nodes.

So you have 3 "same" wallets distributed over 3 places? 
I use a Nano Ledger S and have one as backup.

Good choice :)
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:28:08
Is it possible to use a HW.1 as Nano Ledger S backup?! If yes, how?!
