No, this ain't going to cause any problem. Bitstamp does most of its operations in Slovenia but cash isn't going over any Slovenian bank. Even if it were, the Slovenian legislation is the key here, not the ownership of banks. Slovenia is relatively bitcoin-friendly at the moment.

I have found answers to my first question through comments and on the internet, citing "Because private keys contain many digits when expressed as decimal numbers, an alternative format called Wallet Import Format (WIF) has been devised. This format begins with the number "5" and contains a sequence of letters and numbers.".
I still wonder about BIP38 and importing of pvt key/actually spending the coins from paper wallet.

No, because fiat was not in bubble compared to bitcoin, but it was bitcoin that had a price bubble.
@_date: 2014-09-24 13:41:14
Definitely choosing option a). However in that case with only 21 million bitcoins it would be practically impossible for bitcoin to be priced at 1usd because there wouldn't be enough bitcoins out there to satisfy all the ongoing transactions, let alone potential user holdings and bitcoins sitting on exchanges for arbitrage and trading purposes. Higher price would come naturally. The "unnatural" part of high bitcoin price comes from speculative investment, I agree we don't need the price based on that.

Merchant adoption actually does matter since anyone who spends bitcoin must hold them in order to do so. There is some time before bitcoins are purchased, spent on product and then converted back to fiat. The higher the adoption is the more bitcoin circulating is required, thus higher demand. Imagine someone who spends 10BTC per year. At some point, his BTC balance would be 2 or 3 BTC and at some point maybe zero. On average his balance has let's say 1.6BTC all the time. Sum the averages across all the users and even merchants (even if they hold only for a few minutes) and you get a considerable demand.   
If users would only spent their existing bitcoins then yes, that would cause selling pressure. However, that equals divesting (selling BTC for USD = "selling" BTC for product) and can't last forever either.

Top 500 addresses mostly consist of "pool addresses" that contain bitcoin from several individuals, such as money on exchanges, payment processors, gambling sites, mining pools etc. Many of the addresses are probably strongly secured paper wallets - especially those with nice round number of bitcoins in them such as 10k, 5k and so on.
Because in time (with number of blocks) the total amount of bitcoin increases, so does the amount accumulated in those top 500 addresses as there's more bitcoin in circulation and on the market. Nothing special at all.

$1 billion worth of bitcoins at current prices would pretty much dry up all the exchanges and he'd still be buying. Price would skyrocket and volume (in bitcoin terms especially) would fall a lot after the initial huge spike (cus noone has any bitcoin to sell). It would take a bit of time till new bitcoins hit the exchanges and price would make a bit of a correction but still consolidate at a much high value than at the beginning.
@_date: 2014-09-23 02:44:17
As far as I see this there are two options:
1. You have 0 bitcoins. You purchase some and spend some -this is the idea of only having *hot wallet* balance. You will have to buy at least as much as you spend.
2. You have existiting bitcoins, you spend them and don't re-buy - that is the case of divesting. Instead of selling bitcoins for USD, you "sold" them for products. Either way, you didn't restore your previous balance so you divested. But this definitely wasn't caused because of new merchant adoption - therefore merchant adoption had no negative effect. Simply said, you only wanted to "get rid off" bitcoins.

I don't think that was confirmation bias. The fact it happened did not confirm any of my believes because I didn't have any. Simply when I saw that huge wall of bitcoin wanting to be sold I wondered how low is it going to end. Seeing how fast 30k BTC were bought out once market decided the price was undervalued truly surprised me. There's millions of dollars literally waiting for the right opportunity to jump on the market. If there had been a seller 5x as big, I'm sure price would tank even harder but how far can it go? At the price of $10 all available bitcoins would quickly vanish...

Well given the fact that the current price is around $320 the market price  for 0.25 BTC would equal $80 +fees +spread.
@_date: 2014-12-01 15:07:39
Collective opinion on the price is current price + interest rate (which is kinda low so we can ignore it).
This means that BTC on 31.12.2014 should be worth approx 380 USD.
@_date: 2015-05-01 15:45:44
Regulation of bitcoin is not a necessity, but in order for it to get a legal status and to be more widely and *legally* used, it has to be regulated at some point. Regulation doesn't always mean negative, suppressing methods but also means that government could say "you're completely free in using bitcoin" - just like with paper cash, which is official currency and legal tender, yet you're free to move it around (in normal quantities).

Firstly, lets talk about security of a pure paper wallet - meaning having a private key written on a piece of paper. If the process of creating the paper wallet (as you described above) is truly secure, the only way to get to your private key is by either getting the piece paper or guessing it. Chance to brute guess is too low to be considered so the only way plausible way to get this private key is by acquiring your piece of paper. By creating many copies you've increased the chances of it falling into wrong hands. By encrypting it with BIP38 you did a good job. The password strength is the key here however. For the password to be truly secure you'd need it to be random and long (for comparison, private key is essentially 160 coin tosses secure). 
Essentially, now you 2 layers of security - physical security + encryption (password) security. By making many copies and giving them to other people you've made the physical layer a bit less secure. What you rely on is BIP38 password strength. For it to be strong it should not use any dictionary words or phrases of any kind and have a long string of random characters. Essentially having 20+ random characters is hard to remember and is difficult and risky - so you'd need a paper backup for password (making whole BIP38 encryption meaningless). 
Conclusion: Your security is good because you are combining physical and password security at the same time. Even so, you should make sure each of them is as strong as possible especially the physical one because without this layer your private key is as vulnerable as the BIP38 password strength you've chosen.

@_date: 2015-01-24 19:41:21
In the end, the problem remains. If you plan to remember the password, you are facing risks of forgetting it. Also coins will be lost together with you if you die in accident. If you write pw down, however, encryption isn't solving anything.
I'm pretty sure there are almost as many coins lost by people forgetting their passwords than actually coins being stolen, if not more. Is our paranoia the biggest thief in the end?

As much as I wish they reopened the exchange as soon as possible, I kind of want them to take their time and create a beastly exchange I can trust and continue to use.

Complete translation:
Slovenian bitcoin exchange Bitstamp remains closed - hackers supposedly stole around 19000 bitcoins from its servers (4,3 million eur).
"Bistamp remains liquid, but I can't tell more because of the investigation" said co-founder Damijan Merlak and added they closed the exchange because otherwise "important trails could be erased". "With experts we are currently setting up a duplicate of entire infrastructure in San Francisco, which is bound to finish in the next 24 hours. At that time we will continue our services." explained Merlak for STA.
At the exchange they claim to have "more than enough reserves" to cover lost bitcoins. Hackers supposedly stole only "small part" of all bitcoins - because of cases as this one, exhanges keep majority of their bitcoins in offline computers.

Providing translation of key points 
**Tracking the hackers, who stole bitcoin: time of the attack was carefully selected, Bitstamp founders were on the plane** 
Expert in internet security Gorazd Novšak has analyzed the events on 4 January, when hackers broke into the Slovenian bitcoin exchange Bitstamp. He believes time almost certainly was not chosen at random. He otherwise adds that Bitstamp has stabilised, has sufficient reserves and has further improved technology after the attack 
1. He stated that Bitstamp prevented an even greater catastrophe and saved approximately 6,500 bitcoins. Atacker started to empty the Bitstamp wallet on January 4 at 2 hours and 26 minutes, Bitstamp reacted over 20 hours later and began to empty their hot wallet.  
 
2. *Why did it take so long before they react?* Bitstamp CEO Nejc Kodric was on plane to USA, where Bitstamp was supposed to attend CES fair. Nejc was on a plane during the attack and couldn't react. The time of the attack was definitely not random, hackers may have been prepared for a longer time, waiting for the right opportunity. 
3. Basically Novšak says that hacker may have been a newbie (at least to a bitcoin world). He was using large transaction fees and accumulating funds on single address and it attracted a lot of attention. The stealing of the 19000 bitcoins was actually very slow, over 24 hours period. Bitstamp took only 1.5 hours to rescue 6000 bitcoins, while the whole operation lasted 3 hours. Novšak also mentions how hacker left some bitcoins to bitstamp due to them hitting the change address and getting transfered to bitstamp cold wallet.  
4. He is just saying how blaming Bitstamp owners for stealing their own funds is ridiculuous (where did he read that?) and how Bitstamp improved their technology (multisig wallets).

I have no idea where you guys found me, but 3 years later I am still hodling strong behind that comment. I did however sold some of the stack as a part of risk diversification in my portfolio. Stick to the golden bitcoin investing rules and define your personal exit strategy and you'll be fine.

Changetip gave you $10, you gave out much more? There must be some satisfaction involved in giving out tips, am I right?

That's great to hear. I think tipping and donations are one of the most wonderful things involving bitcoin. I wish media covered this aspects more. Actually if I google "tipping donations" top results involve tipping Tuesday and cryptos. Thanks for the generous tip!

Actually 90 would be more than enough sample size for this subreddit if sample was truly random. I know it's not and I ain't even this straw-poll creator. But case remains, people were way too pessimistic 2 weeks ago. I kept reading "Bitcoin will go below $100 in next days" and other similar remarks.

This might become a weekly allowance budget for my kid in 15 years or just a funny memory. Win in any case :)
