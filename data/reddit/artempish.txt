Value comes from utility and supply/demand. 
Gold is valuable because its semi-scare and can be used as a strong conductor of electricity as well as its scarcity. 
So part of the value of gold comes from application, part from exclusivity (showing off and saying "hey this thing is XX carat gold).
It's kind of the same with Bitcoin, part of the value comes from what you can do with it, and part of the value comes from the 21m limit.

Right.  That's what I thought. But what happens if 2m of those 4 aren't lost but HEDL? 
The value is adjusted and increased on the premise of 17m being in circulation, which increases the value of 1 Bitcoin, so that means the 2m HEDL increases as well.
What happens to the value when the 2m HEDL are redeemed? Will the price drop significantly or will it be like finding a single $100 like u/snomannen suggested?
Or will it be similar to a standard market adjustment like they suggested?

Value comes from the amount in circulation though. So while it may not be deleted, it may be lost. 
Like imagine taking a 20 and burning it, the amount of USD in circulation is now -20.
If enough people burned enough 20's the amount of USD would be affected which would cause an increase in value, or the FED would have to print more to adjust.

So its possible that there isn't going to be 21m coin in circulation because of unaccounted loss?
What are the implications of this?
I imagine the value will increase, but what happens when assumed lost coins are redeemed? So say it's assumed 2m coins are lost, the value corrects to a 19m coin market, what happens when a million of those "lost" coins are redeemed?

Alright. That's essentially what I though.
As the circulated supply  decreases, the value increases, giving an advantage to the HODLer's.

So that decreases the number of total coins in circulation right? 
So say 1 million coins were lost, the total amount of bitcoin in circulation is now 20m, which would raise the value of the not-lost coins right?

So how is this tracked and values adjusted for it?
How does the system know a coin was lost versus just being HEDL?

Aren't keys designed to be almost impossible to crack?
Also, how does the bitcoin community decide to increase the number of coins?
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:26:52
So, just like the stock market?
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:21:34
A single $100 wont change the market. But what happens when long time HODLer's  cash in?

How is a hard fork implemented? 
Who decides when?
