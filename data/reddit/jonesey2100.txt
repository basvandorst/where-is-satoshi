You could open a short on the equivalent amount you have...
And then you would preserve your gains no matter what happens.
You wouldn´t gain more, but you wouldt loose more either.
Pretty solid strategy if you just want to preserve what you have right now.

Right now the Total Market Cap of Bitcoin is around $17 Billion roughly 0.17% of Gold.
If there were 20,000,000 Bitcoins valued at $100,000 that would equal $2 Trillion almost 30% the Market Cap of Gold. What is realistic?
I can definitely see how a $10,000-$20,000 Bitcoin may be possible. But we will not know....before we know.
In 25 years...Anything is possible.

Try the offline Ledger Nano S.
Been using it the last couple of months. Best buy last year :)

Sit back. Relax. Come back in 15 years time. 
Then go and buy a nice house. With ocean view.

Best choice you have made this year ;) 
You have to use the Ledger Wallet - a chrome plugin/app. Which functions as my main wallet now. 
It is the only choise you have with the Ledger nano. It works as a charm :) 
I send and recieve everything from that.

Nobody has ever went broke by buying low, and selling higher.
Good strategy if you need the money now.
