It's cheaper, but I wouldn't say it was cheap. Especially for an eastern European country.

It seems it's not quite as simple as you think.
@_date: 2014-10-12 20:11:20
Instead of wasting your time posting this comment, why don't you find something more constructive to do, or even just chill out? I did search and came back with nothing definitive. The 404 error threw me and I used to trade BTC a lot 1-2 years ago so it made me... Why am I telling you this, it's got nothing to do with you. In the  future, if you don't like something, downvote and move on.
@_date: 2014-10-12 20:53:58
Yea,  LOL, it would be so tongue face worthy.
@_date: 2014-10-12 20:15:30
I received the same thing. I followed the link because it was weebly, I wasn't going to download anything though, it just gave me a 404 error.

If my aunty had bollocks then she'd be my uncle.
Bitcoin's exchange rate did increase (there was always a good chance of that happening) and that's the end of it.


That depends entirely on the amount of debt and how much money he/she invested.

There are many on here who know what they're talking about, it's just a shame that I have to wade through 300+ trite/fatuous comments in order to find them.

I've read the whole artice, along with other definitions. The vast majority agree on one thing Fiat currency is **Government** backed. Bitcoin is **not**.

Cheers mate.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:48:01
I was in a very similar situation. I first discovered BTC when it was at £7, when it rose to £20 I thought it would be wise to let the price drop before investing. I kept waiting for the price to drop, I eventually bought a few coins at £65. When it hit £132 today I bought some more... I regret not buying earlier, hindsight is a wonderful thing...
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:38:11
That is not the definition of a "Fiat Currency".


@_date: 2013-04-11 17:24:45
If you want a rig then I suggest creating your own.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:29:49
Come on, BTC was never going to continue rising in worth. If you're looking for short-terms gains and have money invested which you can not afford to lose, I suggest selling now. The price of BTC is going to drop. However, if you can afford to keep your coins (or even buy more) then do so, many of us still know that BTC will most likely change the face of currency. It's only getting started.
@_date: 2013-04-30 21:47:34
I'd be more worried about the sellers.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:48:00
Sequels are never as good as the originals...
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:07:55
It depends, did he/she use a crystal ball or his mind to predict the future? If it was the latter, then yea, I'd call that smart. BTC could have easily continued to rise past $300. Mt.Gox's fuck up caused this, not BTC itself.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:06:08
Yea, I've tailored my front page so I rarely see the ridiculous memes. Unfortuantely the ignorant circlejerk is endemic.

Do you know what a ponzi scheme is?
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:58:54
I agree. BTC will become huge in the long term. This short-term bubble nonsense is all down to the media furore surrounding BTC. However, I will say this: everyone who is in this for short term gain and has invested money which they can not afford to lose; sell, sell every fucking coin you have because the price is going to drop, big time. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:15:37
Your username makes me nauseous.

Yep, they keep stalling. It's always next month, or even next fortnight.

When referencing drugs the term "user" conveys "the end consumer". However, I apologise for misinterpreting you.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:53:25
I hope we can both agree that you were lucky, no one had a fucking clue of how high BTC would rise.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:43:31
Which chart would that be?
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:40:06
That's exactly what I thought.
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:00:32
And you answered with minimal thought, well done.

I very much doubt that "illegal and irrelevant information" would be upvoted. Reddit works via a system of democracy, people upvote what they want to see.

@_date: 2013-04-21 16:45:32
Regular crashes are really bad news for a currency. The more they occur, the less trust people have in it. The only people who hope for crashes are greedy investors who do not give a fuck about the curreny.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:22:28
Exactly, if you're in it for the long haul then these short term blips aren't worth worrying about. Every price we have seen so far is still cheap for BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:20:30
I'm also optimistic, I'm talking short-term gains. This guy could make a killing buying back in when the price plummets.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:44:44
@_date: 2013-04-21 16:36:33


So you're reiterating the point for a third time?
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:35:41
Why is it the end of BTC as something "valuable"? If you had said "this may very well be the end of BTC as an investment" then I'd have agreed with you.
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:33:10


There are alot of frank and well thought-out comments in this sub. Sure you will find a few "circlejerks", but that is to be expected anywhere on Reddit.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:28:32


Because it's not a fucking plant, BTC actually has the potential to change the face of curency. It pisses me off when people attempt to compare the two literally. It's an entirely different concept.

I think you should read up on what a fiat currency is, and what it isn't. 
All money is backed by it's "usefulness", although that is a very ambiguous term.
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:06:12
How is bitcoin a fiat currency? This is a genuine question.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:58:11
Not a lot, not anymore anyway. It wouldn't affect my life if I lost the coins, but it would massively piss me off!

Because people are panicking, if the largest exchange can not be trusted then what can? Even sites like Btistamp are inundated with many people trying to sell BTC, this drives the price down. It's all controlled by opinion, nothing more.

I actually don't agree, there are many people out there who **do** know what they're talking about when it comes to their chosen field of expertise. Although, I do agree that there are even more people who enjoy mimicking these types by using buzzwords which are designed to impress the layman.
And when it comes to economics, I am most certainly a layman. However, I can normally tell when someone is talking utter bollocks.
