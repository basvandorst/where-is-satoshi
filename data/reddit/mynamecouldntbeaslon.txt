'He' is more than likely a group of people. Check out the comments to the code in v 0.1 he is asking 'himself' questions.

Why would Reddit decide to promote this sub? I don't see that much of a benefit.
@_date: 2014-03-07 08:17:05
For some reason that bothers me a lot... Particularly the sidebar.
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:08:48
That is honestly heartbreaking...
@_date: 2014-02-13 16:51:12
The code I write, when it's going to be seen by someone else, usually has just comments explaining what I'm doing. I keep my own questions to myself, but maybe that't just me.

Until one of your addresses becomes associated with yourself.

Explain, please?

Are you any of the people in the original pic? Because I'm pretty sure that's just the apple store in Kurfuerstendamm. As far as I know, no offices there.

The transfer was never the Problem. The *acquisition* makes it so much harder.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:15:08
any strange movements?
@_date: 2017-10-03 10:18:14
can you explain? I have little bitcoin in a blockchain.info wallet, what is being recommended to do when the fork comes?
@_date: 2013-09-20 18:40:02
Exactly, many many thanks!

You can get local beers here (in Berlin, Germany) for less than 1 euro in the supermarket. 2.5 I would consider overpriced in a bar on the eastern side of the city (where I live).

i find this ironic
@_date: 2013-12-11 11:11:31
Where's the profit here? Not even one tip in this chain!
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:56:13
So I can post my address and get free money?
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:03:09
In my very limited experience. People with a tech background believe 'in the cause'. They ride the waves up and down with little to no fuzz. The financial people are more concerned with 'how do I buy them, how do I transfer them and how do I store them safely.
It seems to me that both camps still have some 'I'm here to get rich quickly', but their technical backgrounds overlap in so few areas that they are mostly even pitted as a 'us vs them' scenario.

check bitcoin.org
i started my wallet in block chain (not recommended it seems), and for mining purposes, unless you have a gpu or something, it's gonna be quite hard, better join a pool or something like that, you could also read this:

You have to do it via a bot, here check this link out:

They are a little bit overpriced, I think.

This isn't a very well known sub by any means. Also, it is supposed to be frequented my more tech-savvy people. Who in their right mind would fall for something like this?? Particularly since the name doesn't match any with the employees or founders...
@_date: 2013-09-20 18:09:20
Thank you, a chart is very useful but I'm looking more for a dataset rather than a visual representation.
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:38:10
I guess so. I am one of those.This place is *exceptionally* good if you are a typical redditor who knows some programming languages. The start up scene here is big, and you can get contacts literally anywhere: I've seen people get recruited at the German lessons at the VHS. If anything else fails, you could try working in some office from the European Union, there are a lot here, and Germany is only bound to get much more important in the region, I think.
Here, try this:

Join a pool.
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:00:20
So, this is a thing.
