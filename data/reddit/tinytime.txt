They're called friends. You should be able to talk with them about anything. You don't have to follow their advice if you don't want to.

No, no you aren't. If you were, you wouldn't need random comments and suggestions.

Many people have an interest in feeding the bitcoin frenzy with submissions such as yours. But I don't know you, good luck if you are telling the truth.

I'd also attack my opponent's intellect if I felt cornered and couldn't rationally dispute his original argument. Have a nice life.

That's just it, there is no incentive. 99.99 percent of people have no need for such a currency.

Nice pyramid scheme.

That's the best you've got?

Figure out that they have no reason to ever require the use of a bitcoin, just like 99.99 percent of the global population?

Hoarding = smaller supply of bitcoins available to be purchased = higher prices for bitcoins = no reason to ever spend bitcoins = worthless as a currency.
