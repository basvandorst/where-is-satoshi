Earlier today I sent 0.05 BTC directly to 1GiCm9NRB1La1cPUjD8rnZUeko62A74Hrv.  That was outside of reddit.  Nothing is frustrating like having a wallet with zero balance.  Money given to you via bitcointip in reddit just as real but will reside in a different wallet.  You can move bitcoin back and forth between wallets.

Don't do it like me.  You have to give bitcointip 0.75 for the ability.  I had given only 0.25.  Embarrassing!

I would also suggest giving the 0.75 time to settle. Maybe a day. I donated and the bitcoin transferred to bitcointip. I tried to tip in a non-enabled subreddit within a few minutes.  It couldn't see me yet.  In fact, I ended up in this [bug](

Just retyping it from the image.  Triple-checked for type-o's.  It was:
I hope that is OK.  I doubt it would be considered rude since it was in the image.  It might be nice to have a place to read up on bitcoin etiquette.  And bitcointip etiquette.

I got it. Thank You!  Just to be clear the first address isn't mine but OPs and I sent a small amount to that address.  Also good to know that the address will change sometimes.

Sorry. Us noobs are all having fun sending money to each other but it probably gets old for the veterans.  We need a sandbox I guess.
