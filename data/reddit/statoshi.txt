In case you didn't read the article I wrote over a year ago, the primary problem is UTXOs. People can't use bitcoin (regardless of any of the above mentioned improvements) unless they first take ownership of UTXOs. This is why block size still becomes a bottleneck.

If Lightning Network becomes enormously successful, you can expect on-chain fees to rise dramatically. If Lightning Network allows a user to reduce their on-chain transactions by a factor of X, then it makes economic sense for a user to be willing to pay any fee that is less than AVERAGE_BITCOIN_FEE * X - AVERAGE_LIGHTNING_FEE * X. I covered this and more in [this article](

OK, check out the test framework here: 
Specifically check out the utility functions: 
Basically, you'll want to initialize the datadirs for the regtest nodes, then start them, connect the nodes to each other, then use the other utility functions to generate transactions and blocks on the different nodes. every once in a while you can call sync_blocks() in order to wait for all the nodes to get back in sync on the same chain fork. Make sense?

Mimblewimble doesn't actually exist and it's not certain that it ever will exist. If it does turn into a useful technology, it would be as a sidechain, which means that main chain UTXOs would still be a bottleneck for the sidechain pegging process.

If you want to have a great data set for your block explorer, you should create a local network with several nodes running in regtest mode and have the various nodes generate lots of blocks and transactions. This should result in quite a few forks.

I've found that it's easier to just make a "stop" RPC call to the peer you want to disconnect, but this may not suit your purpose if you need that node to remain connected to other peers. 
@_date: 2016-04-03 23:35:41
Correct. The fee estimation algorithms don't use median / average fees but rather look for the lowest fees that still result in a high rate of confirmation within the target number of blocks. 
@_date: 2016-04-14 13:58:08
As far as I know there is no technical minimum amount other than probably the bitcoin transaction output dust limits. It will just depend upon what you are trying to do. If you're trying to be a routing node then you'll want to dedicate a higher amount and open a higher number of channels. If you just want to send or receive payments, you'd need to decide how much activity you want the channel to be able to handle before you have to close it. Though hopefully a lot of that decision-making will be abstracted away from the everyday user.
@_date: 2016-04-03 15:24:30
Probably because a lot of people using hard coded static fees have increased them and are significantly overpaying the market rate. I've seen a lot of transactions recently paying 0.0005 static fees which often correlates to several hundred satoshis per byte - more than 10X the usual market rate.
@_date: 2016-04-03 23:27:32
There's nothing confusing about this phenomenon when users are setting hard coded fees. If you're using hard coded fees then you're either going to underpay and get really slow confirmation times or you're going to overpay.

@_date: 2018-01-01 12:01:59
This is correct. The scarce resource on-chain is block space, thus fees are based upon the data size of the transaction. The scarce resource on Lightning Network is channel capital, thus the fees are based upon the value being moved. However, it's worth noting that it's even more complicated because lightning nodes will set their own fees and they may even be negative in some cases if your transfer will help to rebalance a given payment channel. This is because it will be less expensive to rebalance the channel than to close and reopen it with an on-chain transaction.

This is a decentralized project; you aren't going to find hard timelines for deliverables. It's an interative process; there won't be a single date where suddenly Lightning Network is "rolled out." There have already been transactions performed on the main network; bootstrapping a new network the likes of which has never been seen before doesn't happen overnight.
Regarding "BTC dominance" - this is a metric that folks use to make Bitcoin users feel like Bitcoin is failing despite the fact that it's absurdly successful.

Right, without any bridge nodes there would be a network partition.
Main benefits are to keep your real IP address safe from targeted attacks (my home connection has been DoS'd in the past which was annoying. Also you get better privacy from network surveillance when you create transactions and broadcast them. Thankfully next year this should be less of an advantage when clearnet nodes can broadcast transactions with the Dandelion protocol.
To be clear, you don't have to connect to a tor exit node. Tor handles the routing automatically. You still don't need to worry about Sybil attacks very much because a single honest peer negates any dishonest peers. And even if your node is only connected to dishonest peers, they can't break any of the protocol rules your node validates.

You aren't going to be able to get huge performance gains here by tuning the node. Rather, what you probably want to do is to keep a compact representation of the UTXO set in memory. Thus you'd be able to look up the input values in constant time. The additional complexity is that you'll want remove UTXOs from memory as they are spent.

Don't accept any argument that "blocks aren't full because the average block size is only X"
This is because even when blocks are completely full, the average block size doesn't exceed 700KB: 
This is for two reasons:
1. Some miners set their soft caps lower than 1 MB
2. Empty blocks sometimes get mined immediately after a new block, because the miner has not had a chance to update their mempool to remove the recently confirmed transactions. Rather than potentially creating an invalid block that confirms an already-confirmed transaction, they start mining an empty block that only contains the coinbase transaction.

My concern is more about the people who think that a permanent 1MB block limit is acceptable even if the majority of broadcast transactions fail to ever confirm because the higher fee transactions will always win.
This turns us back to the ideological argument of "acceptable cost to access the Bitcoin network" - should the network be accessible for a $0.05 fee? A $0.50 fee? A $10 fee?

To be clear, in this thread I've been speaking from the perspective of a blockchain engineer. In most cases it's acceptable for end users to trust BitGo's parsing of blockchain data because the extent of our potential maliciousness is that we may tell the user an inaccurate balance or transaction history, which they can verify by cross referencing other public blockchain services. However, from my perspective, my job is to ensure that this never happens. Thus it's unacceptable to me to use nonvalidated data when I'm building the indices that are used to serve data to our clients. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 12:08:25

Absolutely, though note that it will create a completely new, unique wallet. You'd then need to withdraw any balance from each individual single signature wallet on each device and send it to the multisig wallet.
You should also create the multisig wallet as a SegWit wallet to save on fees when spending from it. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 14:28:52
Not exactly - BitGo users would retain ownership of the coins on both forks. If they tried to spend through our UI or API, it would spend on the fork that our nodes are on. Though it's also likely the transaction would propagate to the nodes on the other fork. But the user always has the option to take their keys and spend them on another fork without touching our servers.
@_date: 2015-06-09 01:45:32
Right, I'm operating under the assumption that the local blockchain data is trustworthy and thus validated by the party using it. If any of the types of blockchain services I mentioned earlier are running on nonvalidated blockchain data, that's a problem. We at BitGo would never consider running our service on nonvalidated blockchain data - why bother even using Bitcoin if it's not trustless?

Correct, because there isn't really a hard number. You could guess as to a lower bound if you knew how many people are using SPV clients at peak times, then divide that number by 100 since a node by default will only allow 120 incoming connections.

As an engineer who works on a blockchain indexing service for a web based wallet, we need to be able to both load historical blockchain data at a high rate of speed and we need to be able to keep up with realtime transactions as they are broadcast. The former means that SPV is unusable because network queries are orders of magnitude slower than local disk reads. Sure, we could just keep blockchain files on local disks for archival access and we could use SPV to stay up to date, but why bother with added complexity when we can just run our own nodes?

I don't claim to be better qualified, though I have [posted my viewpoints]( as an engineer experienced in scaling high growth systems.
I think the reason this debate is so contentious is that it's not ONLY technical but also ideological with regard to centralization (number of nodes / miners), ease of access (bandwidth &amp; other resource requirements), cost of accessing (transaction fees) the Bitcoin network, and probably several other issues I'm forgetting. For example, there are valid arguments that larger block sizes may further centralize the network if it causes too much load for small time operators. There are also valid arguments that smaller block sizes will further centralize the network if the block size remains at 1 MB because more people will be forced to use centralized off-chain services that settle their balances internally.
Because this becomes an ideological debate, I'm much less hopeful that full consensus will be reached. I suspect that once it's all settled, one or more groups within this community will feel wronged.

It's worth noting that this is unlikely to happen unless the node has a very low connection limit. This is because Bitnodes crawls the network every 5 minutes and once it finds a new node, it opens (and maintains) a connection to it.

Kind of but not exactly. If blocks are published within a few seconds of each other then they enter into a race to propagate through the network. Smaller blocks propagate faster and will be more likely to be used as the parent block by miners. Meaning that the larger block is more likely to be orphaned, causing the miner of the larger block to lose their block reward of 25 BTC. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 00:22:01
It really depends upon the nature of the business and their performance requirements. I don't have any hard numbers regarding the number of businesses since very few expose the details of their infrastructure, though if you have hard numbers I'd be happy to see them.

@_date: 2015-06-11 16:13:24
This is not a strong argument, but one way that you COULD consider it detrimental is in terms of total node connections.
Look at it this way: every reachable node that accepts incoming connections adds 120 connection slots to the network and takes away 8 connection slots (of other reachable nodes.) Every unreachable node takes away 8 slots without adding any. Thus, there is a point at which there could be so many unreachable nodes that none of the reachable nodes have open sockets available. And remember that reachable nodes also need to keep sockets open for SPV clients as well.

@_date: 2015-06-10 14:06:14
By increasing your node's outgoing connections, all you're really doing is taking up more connection slots of other nodes on the network (default max is 125 IIRC) which doesn't help much of anything. I suppose if all nodes had more outgoing connections then we'd have a slightly denser mesh of nodes with slightly faster message propagation, but the delta would likely be insignificant.

Some people run nodes out of altruism or because they understand the need for people to support the network - there's an indirect incentive to do so.
However, many businesses that rely upon the block chain will want a copy (preferably multiple copies) of the ledger that they have verified themselves. Especially those that are parsing the block chain for specific data - it's orders of magnitude faster to do so on a local copy than by querying nodes over the network. Therein lies the direct incentive to run nodes.
My perspective is that the decline in nodes that we see is of the altruistic users who are switching to lightweight clients for everyday use. However, underneath the declining number of altruistic nodes is a foundation of nodes that are run out of necessity by enterprises.
@_date: 2015-06-15 20:29:40

To be fair, they are talking about nodes from the end user perspective. Their point seems to be that instead of worrying about the whole network, you should worry about yourself.

"No one" is a stretch. The majority of Core Devs and Miners appear to disagree with the proposed block size increase. On the other hand, many blockchain engineers such as myself, the companies that employ us, and end users appear to be in favor of larger blocks.

Trust is certainly the key word - I am not trusted, nor should I be. All of the code I write is peer reviewed. It's very difficult to place a value on trust since it's subjective. Given that BitGo strives to uphold the values inherent to the protocol, especially its trustless nature, I find it difficult to believe that we'd give up trustlessness even if a third party offered us block chain data for free - the risk isn't worth the cost savings IMO.
I'd be quite eager to talk to engineers at companies that have given up trustlessness in order to better understand why they consider the trade-off to be acceptable.

Bitnodes changed the algorithm it uses to count nodes. It used to count every unique IP address of peers (via the getaddr query) that it could pull from all of the reachable nodes.

All that is necessary is to ensure that no regular transaction creates more output value than it has input value, and that no coinbase transaction creates more new BTC than the inflation schedule allows. By validating those two conditions for every block, it necessarily implicitly validates that the entire supply remains below the inflation schedule.
Could yet another check be added against the /entire/ supply? Sure, though it would be a huge performance hit. You'd have to read tens of millions of UTXOs from the disk and sum up all their values. There is a function that does this in Bitcoin Core and when I run it on a decently powered PC it takes over 10 seconds to complete.

I don't understand how you can make this claim. I take issue with the marketing of this feature as "opt-in" given that it’s not a mutual agreement; only the sender has to announce their intention as opposed to the receiver also accepting it. Recipients of transactions will have to make a conscious effort to add additional processing to handle transactions that may be subject to RBF. That is to say, this RBF implementation is "opt-in" for senders but it's "opt-out" for receivers.

It's not obvious to me that devs are trying to hurt Bitcoin. Rather, the intensity of this debate is because it is not ONLY technical but also ideological with regard to centralization (number of nodes / miners), ease of access (bandwidth &amp; other resource requirements), cost of accessing (transaction fees) the Bitcoin network, and probably several other issues I'm forgetting. 
For example, there are valid arguments that larger block sizes may further centralize the network if it causes too much load for small time operators. There are also valid arguments that smaller block sizes will further centralize the network if the block size remains at 1 MB because more people will be forced to use centralized off-chain services that settle their balances internally.

It's not a part of the protocol itself, but we support setting limits at

Counting nodes is generally a fuzzy estimation - there's no way to ensure 100% accuracy. You can infer an upper bound of unreachable nodes by using Bitnodes' old method of counting known peer addresses by querying nodes with the "getaddr" command, but many of those addresses are likely stale / fake. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 02:04:17
It sounds like you're misunderstanding the meaning of address re-use. Of course you can't send "from" an address that has not received any funds. The point of generating new addresses is that when you send bitcoins, any leftover "[change]( from the output you spent has to go somewhere, preferably to a change address under your control. Some wallets just send the change back to the same address that spent the output - this is the privacy concern. Better wallets will generate a completely unused address to receive your change.

BIP202's max block size stops increasing in the year 2100 at around 84 MB. It's highly unlikely that any block size proposal will be a perfect fit for decades; I expect we'll need to continue forking to adjust up and down as we learn more and make more improvements to the protocol.

I've seen nodes crash from a wide variety of issues over the years and the VAST majority of the time it's due to them using up so much RAM that the kernel kills the process in order to save the OS from grinding to a halt.
Check /var/log/kern.log to see if there are any out of memory messages about the kernel killing the bitcoind process. If that's what is happening then I'd recommend adding more RAM to the machine. If that's not feasible then there are config options available that will reduce the amount of RAM the node needs. Check out the 'Raspberry Pi' config preset I have available on my config generator:

The "we need to directly incentivize full nodes" debate has been going on for years. I've yet to see a bulletproof proposal for incentivizing full nodes, primarily because it would involve creating a new "proof of full node" algorithm that doesn't exist. That is, anyone could run a service that pretends to be a full node and asks for donations, but doesn't actually relay data and help the network, thus we'd need people to be able to prove that their node is actually serving requests.
I'm personally of the opinion that we're going to do fine with indirect incentivization. That is, as more people and businesses come to rely upon the Bitcoin network, they will want to run nodes to help the network and to help themselves from a trust standpoint because you can only truly trust nodes that you operate yourself.

The vast majority of transactions processed on the Bitcoin network are Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash, also known as P2PKH transactions. These contain a locking script that encumbers the output with a public key hash, more commonly known as a bitcoin address.

Yes, it's like UDP in that sense. Which is why any well written client will rebroadcast a transaction if it is not confirmed after a few days.
It's not a guarantee, but if you add a fee to your transaction then it's highly unlikely that miners will forgo collecting the fee and refuse to process the transaction.

The youtube video to which I linked is the counter-argument.
The "social contract" has the same problems as any magic contract; it is better referred to as a "state-imposed burden". It is not a contract (no definition, no agreement), but a burden that justifies arbitrary harm and is imposed by force rather than being voluntary or to any degree "social."
The idea that one can "simply leave" if they disagree is flawed for multiple reasons. Firstly, states have managed to claim ownership of pretty much all habitable territory on the planet. Secondly, their ownership claims of said territory are by and large, illegitimate, as they were acquired through force.
My continued residence in my country does not imply consent to the arbitrary rules put in place by the government. Instead, it implies a preference - I prefer the extortion of this state while being near my community and my family to the extortion of another state while being away from my community and my family.

You can't. If you don't tell the network about a transaction that you create and sign, it can't possibly know about it.

Gotcha. I think it's important to view the definitions of the Authorized Participants and their accounts:








It sounds to me like the Authorized Participant Custody Accounts are segregated from the main pool of shares and thus you would not be able to purchase COIN ETF shares from the main pool and redeem them for bitcoins.
It's also worth noting that even if you did redeem shares for bitcoins within an IRA, you would not legally be able to spend them. I actually converted my Roth IRA into a Self Directed IRA and own a LLC which is the custodian of my IRA's bitcoins. However, I cannot legally do anything with them that would benefit me outside the confines of my IRA - that would be a prohibited transaction.

The short answer is "asymmetric encryption AKA public key cryptography." This is a concept that's difficult to ELI5. 
You could see the public key as a "lock". This lock is a very strong lock, which can't be opened except if you have a single unique key that opens it (this is the private key). If you want to send information to a person and you want to be sure that no one else can read it, you take this lock (the person hands them out to anyone who wants them) and put its on the data. From that point on, no one can open the lock any more, except for the intended recipient, who is the only one who has the private key.
With regard to the network verifying that someone has the private key, the nodes are actually looking at the signature of the transaction. A transaction script contains two components, a signature and a public key. The public key must match the hash given in the script of the redeemed output. The public key is used to verify the redeemers signature, which is the second component. More precisely, the second component is an ECDSA signature over a hash of a simplified version of the transaction. It, combined with the public key, proves the transaction was created by the real owner of the address in question. Various flags define how the transaction is simplified and can be used to create different types of payment.

It's not necessary to run a heavyweight client with the full blockchain - lightweight (SPV) wallets can perform the same functions by querying full nodes for the information they need.
Long-confirmed blocks cannot be edited due to the data structure of the blockchain - each successive block incorporates the hash of the previous block, thus forming the chain. Editing any information within a block would change its hash and thus invalidate the blockchain past that block. Of course, it's a bit more complicated than that.

I don't see how you're linking mining to price, unless you think that more efficient mining means that the supply will increase faster, thus lowering the price. This doesn't happen because the mining difficulty automatically adjusts to changes in the total hash power in order to re-target 10 minute blocks every ~2 weeks.

Sure, there are quite a few different ways that one could attack the network. Bitcoin nodes could be attacked via Denial of Service, for example, if malevolent entities flood the network with requests that they don't really need. There are various rules within a node's code that try to detect such requests and ban such attackers by refusing to talk to them.
The Bitcoin network is quite secure, but nothing is completely secure. Everything has weaknesses - security is a constant battle of attackers vs defenders.

1) Transactions tend to propagate through the majority of nodes on the network in ~1 second: 
2) Nodes already do this. If they receive a transaction that they see is trying to spend an output that has already been used, they ignore it and do not propagate the transaction to their peers. This is why double spending is hard - you have to broadcast multiple transactions within an extremely small time frame and you have to insert them on nearly opposite edges of the node mesh.

It's not something we see often, but it's completely legitimate since it's within the rules of the protocol. Miners are free to publish anywhere from 1 transaction (the coinbase reward) to as many transactions as they can fit within 1 megabyte of data. The miners do control what goes into blocks.

There's not much that you can do as a node operator to influence the speed or volume of transactions on the network. As you can see here, data already propagates through the network mesh quite quickly: 
As for scaling up the volume, as others have noted, it's an issue that needs to be addressed in the protocol itself. There are a number of scalability issues that are being worked on.
More nodes won't help the capacity, but it would be awesome for you to run more because it makes the network more robust against certain types of attacks. More bandwith won't help much except to speed up how quickly new nodes can download the historical blockchain.

One implication that not many people talk about is that increasing the block size would likely not have much effect. This is because miners are incentivized to keep blocks as small as possible so that they propagate through the network faster. A miner wants their block to reach 50% of the nodes on the network before other blocks that may be broadcast by competing miners because the 'losing' block will be orphaned and they will not get to keep the block reward &amp; transaction fees.

Sure, but it's still a stretch to claim that these potentially identifiable fingerprints can then be tied to bitcoin transactions. Even if you A) had all of the timestamped fingerprint data and B) eliminated non-Armory transactions, you could at best state that ~maybe~ for a bitcoin transaction timestamped at time X it belonged to a set of Armory users who pinged between X - 30 minutes and X + 30 minutes. For all we know, that could be a set of thousands of fingerprints. 
TL;DR, certainly not good for privacy, but still seems like a stretch to consider it de-anonymising.

You're approaching this problem from the wrong standpoint - PBMining is broadcasting perfectly valid transactions.

IBLT basically solves a problem with mining that skews the economic incentives; it won't magically allow the network to be able to process thousands of transactions per second. There are a number of other scalability solutions in the works - one must take a multi-pronged approach when it comes to scalability.
Some of the work being done:
* Headers First Syncing - this will eventually allow Bitcoin nodes to parallelize their downloading of data from peers, thus speeding up syncing speeds tremendously.
* Merkle Tree Pruning - this will reduce the amount of disk space required to run a node by no longer storing transactions and blocks unless they have unspent outputs.

There is much more that goes into the market's valuation of a cryptocurrency than the number of merchants who accept it as payment for goods and services. Remember that Bitcoin (and its clones) are Internet protocols for accessing and manipulating distributed public accounting ledgers. The utility offered by such protocols has value to many different people for many different reasons. The cryptocurrency that can offer the most utility to the most people should end up with the highest market value.

Hm, that should not be a fatal error for bitcoind - it's a normal error that occurs when a double spend is detected. Are you sure that it wasn't auto-killed by the kernel? If you're running bitcoind on a VPS without enough RAM, sometimes the process is automatically killed to 'save' the rest of the system. IIRC, this issue usually results in a message being logged to /var/log/syslog about the kernel killing the bitcoind process.
The disk I/O error is much more straightforward - your VPS simply doesn't have enough space. We're bumping up against 30 GB requirement for an Ubuntu VPS at the moment - I'd allocate at least 40 GB to give yourself some wiggle room.

To be more specific, each block has a hash in its header which verifies ALL of the data included within the block. There are validation checks performed by a node when it receives a block that ensures that both the transactions contained within the block are valid and that the block as a whole is valid. If the data was corrupted in transmission, these checks would fail.

I actually believe that the average node operator should be running a node at home rather than on a VPS, if they have the bandwidth to spare. My tests have shown that you only need ~10-20 KB/S of dedicated downstream to run a full node. The upstream usage is spiky and nearly unlimited; I would prefer node operators to be able to dedicate 100 KB/S of upstream, which can be achieved by various throttling methods depending upon your operating system.

At the moment I'd think that the blockchain size is too large for a phone. Merkle tree pruning should make it more feasible, but we don't know when that feature will land. From a bandwidth perspective, we have determined that 20 KB/S downstream is sufficient to handle the requirements of a node, while the upstream usage is nearly unlimited if you don't throttle your node. So long as you relay more data than you download, you are making a positive contribution to the network.

[The Statoshi Project](
[Peeking Under the Hood of a Running Bitcoin Node](

It is true that we would prefer to have more nodes in order to further decentralize the network and thus disperse our need to trust any given node. It would also further strengthen the network against denial of service and sybil attacks.
I have yet to see any worthwhile argument that the geographic distribution of nodes is actually an issue. People in Africa who have access to an Internet connection can access the Bitcoin network just as easily as people in the United States. Also, I have yet to see a convincing argument that direct incentivization for running a node is necessary.

You can send them back to the address(es) from which they were sent, or you can try to determine if there was a 'change' address created in the original transaction, which you could send them to.

Or you can visit  in a browser from the machine. Take that IP address and plug it into Bitnodes' tool to verify. Though if you have more than 8 connections, I'm certain that you have correctly set up the port forwarding on your router.
With regard to how long it takes to build up connections - it can take several weeks of constant uptime due to the way that peer node addresses get passed around the network. If your node is on a flaky connection, its address may never propagate sufficiently to have 50+ peers connect to you.

It's worth noting that the 0.10 release of Bitcoin Core will including headers-first parallelized syncing which will reduce the initial blockchain download time from days / weeks to just a few hours if your downstream speeds are fast enough.

This is generally how web-based services work - they define a standard port on which to communicate. However, it should be noted that it is NOT a requirement that you run bitcoind on port 8333. It's configurable by the node operator.
If you're trying to make bitcoin network data transmission harder to trace or block, port hopping / randomization would be near the bottom of the list of things to change. The biggest problem is probably that all of the data is transmitted unencrypted, thus it's easily sniffable. This issue came up recently on the development list and TL;DR it's hard to make a case for encrypting the data given the fact that it ends up on a public, transparent ledger.

I've never come across a low level explanation, but I can tell you my best guess from what I've observed in logs of my nodes when they reached that state. It generally appears to be an issue where the peer from whom you're downloading skips a block and you end up with a long chain of orphaned blocks while still waiting on the missing block to get filled in. I suppose that there wasn't any proper logic to handle this scenario and it would result in long waits and thus stalled syncing. IIRC there was a note in the 0.9.2 release about improving the logic to handle stalled downloads, but I don't think it was a perfect bug fix because I've still experienced the problem on that release. You can reader about the headers-first changes here:

Even nodes that don't accept incoming connections still play a role in relaying transactions and blocks around the network - just as not as important a role because they are only relaying data to 7 peers as opposed to dozens / 100+.
@_date: 2014-10-20 14:56:00
Potentially because empty blocks are smaller in terms of data size and thus propagate through the mesh of nodes faster, resulting in a higher likelihood that the block ends up becoming part of the main chain.

Well, in general you want to spool up new nodes in areas that are sparsely populated by nodes at the moment. Looking at the  is a good start, but there's more to it than simple geographic distribution. Adding nodes anywhere is generally good, but if you're adding a node inside a data center that already has tons of other nodes, you won't be helping the network as much.
When I saw that my VPS host had a facility in Luxembourg, I checked the current nodes at  and saw that none of them were hosted on my host's network, so I figured it was a good idea to add one.

Indeed, it's an onion of consensus mechanisms. Consensus is required amongst the Core devs, the miners, the node operators, and of course the end-users.

[The Statoshi Project](
[Peeking Under the Hood of a Running Bitcoin Node](
[How Many Bitcoin Nodes is Enough?](
It is true that we would prefer to have more nodes in order to further decentralize the network and thus disperse our need to trust any given node. It would also further strengthen the network against denial of service and sybil attacks.
I have yet to see any worthwhile argument that the geographic distribution of nodes is actually an issue. People in Africa who have access to an Internet connection can access the Bitcoin network just as easily as people in the United States. Also, I have yet to see a convincing argument that direct incentivization for running a node is necessary. Unlike mining, it is trivial for a single technically-minded person to spool up multiple nodes.

At a fundamental level, the Bitcoin network generates data as people use it, which is completely different from torrents.

The hard coded maximum number of connections in Bitcoin Core is 120. The longer your node runs continuously, the better connected it will become to the network mesh. This is because nodes share addresses of peers with each other. When you restart your node, you sever all the incoming connections and those peers are unlikely to reconnect to you unless one of the other nodes in their 8 outbound connections disconnects.

This was my greatest concern for a while when I first got into Bitcoin. Eventually I realized that, worst case scenario, Satoshi could only dump his coins on the market one time, after which they would become dispersed throughout the ecosystem.
If you believe that innovators should be rewarded, and you believe in free market economics, then Satoshi deserves to be enriched by his invention. It also seems that Satoshi would not be stupid enough to crash the market by dumping all of his coins at once. In fact, many speculate that he may never spend his coins because so many people are watching the addresses and would try to de-anonymize him if he spent them.

Well, "secured" is a very broad term. At that point the unconfirmed transaction is in the mempool of the Bitcoin nodes, but it is not confirmed by miners and permanently stored in the blockchain. At this point it COULD be possible that a miner publishes a block that contains a transaction that invalidates the unconfirmed transaction in the mempool. Though it's fairly unlikely unless it was the miner who published the first transaction. Though IIRC, GHash performed exactly that type of double spend attack back in 2013, which they blamed upon a rogue employee.

I don't know what you consider normal; I've found the bandwidth requirements to run an unthrottled full node are only ~20 KB/S downstream and ~50 KB/S upstream.

Yes, and the fact that the block reward greatly exceeds any potential transaction fees. Winning the block propagation race is a greater incentive than including transactions. This is why Gavin's O(1) block propagation fix is incredibly important. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 14:09:58
Here's your answer: 
As you can see, the 'next block hash' is pulled at the time of the RPC request - it's not actually stored in the old block. Bitcoin Core maintains an index of blocks and it simply looks up the next block in the chain and adds that block's hash to the JSON that is returned.

1. They technically don't need the entire blockchain to propagate transactions; they need it in order to serve requests for historical data.
2. As much as possible. I've been looking into this for the better part of this year, and ended up creating [Statoshi]( as a result. [How many nodes is enough?](
3. Bootstrapping will be faster than syncing over the network regardless of what device the node is running on. [How to set up a Full Node](
4. Headers-first downloads and parallelized downloading of data from multiple nodes simultaneously will greatly increase the speed at which a node syncs the historical blockchain. [The State of the Bitcoin Network](

It's awesome from a trustless standpoint, but it takes a decent amount of computing time. Last time I bootstrapped a node a few months ago, I think it took ~10 hours to validate the data. It takes much, much longer if you don't bootstrap the blockchain and have to download it from peers.

The "coinbase" transaction is the transaction in each block that creates the new coins and assigns them as the block reward to the miner who generates it.

I had those fears when I originally got into Bitcoin. Then I realized that they can only 'cash out' once, at which point the coins would become much more dispersed as the rest of the community gleefully bought them up at cut-rate prices.
The exchange rate dropping due to a whale dumping a ton of coins on the market would not be a "huge blow" to Bitcoin. Bitcoin would continue to function just fine.

Well, this number is constantly increasing. Let's update it! Current estimated petaFLOPS of the mining infrastructure (which isn't a one-to-one comparison since miners don't perform floating point operations) is 2,248,804. Fastest supercomputer at the moment is China's Tianhe-2 at 33.86 petaFLOPS. That makes the Bitcoin computational power roughly 66,414X faster than the reigning supercomputer. Trying to find and add up the power of the next 499 supercomputers sounds like too much effort, especially since their power likely drops off quickly - the second fastest is half the speed of the fastest.

It's a decent idea and not the first time I've heard the proposal. I don't think you accurately described pruning, however. My understanding is not that pruning only stores the last X blocks, but rather that it removes storage of old transactions that no longer contain unspent outputs.
The major problem to overcome will be that this is a major architectural change from the standpoint that full nodes are meant to be authoritative for the entirety of Bitcoin's transaction history. This will likely introduce more potential attack vectors, so I'd urge you to take your system and try to figure out how it could be gamed by other nodes lying about what blocks they host.

It's true that you could deplete the bandwidth resources of nodes if you ran a huge number of SPV clients that were constantly using the network.

I've seen nodes get stalled while downloading the historical blockchain for days at a time; this is generally evident if you look at the debug.log in your "bitcoin" data directory. If you see a ton of log lines that say something to the effect of "ORPHANED BLOCK XX" then it may be helpful for you to shut down the bitcoin client and start it back up again. In my experience this will force it to restart the syncing from a different peer and fixes the stalled download. FWIW, the next release of Bitcoin Core will include parallelized block downloading from multiple peers and fixes this issue of stalled downloads.

The Tragedy of the Commons applies to neither Bitcoin nor Bittorrent because the Tragedy of the Commons specifically refers to situations where groups of people are depleting a shared finite resource.

I'm optimistic because I have experimented with this myself. It's not difficult to deploy nodes that maintain ~1,000 connections if you're using a modified version of Bitcoin Core. It is difficult to get a single instance of bitcoind to support more than this, thus in order to have enough instances of modified nodes that are connected to the majority of the network would require writing custom software to manage which nodes each of your modified instances is connected to.
But, even then, it's not an exact science. Due to network delays and the fact that the first "inv" broadcast that you receive may be a relay from a SPV client that is connected to that full node, you're still making a best guess as to the origin.

This is because the current version only downloads blocks from a single peer. Sometimes you end up connecting to a slow peer and your block download stalls. As noted, closing and reopening Bitcoin Core helps. This is because when you restart Bitcoin Core, it will in all likelihood start downloading from a different (and probably faster) peer.
On the bright side, the upcoming 0.10 release will fix this bottleneck and block downloads will be parallelized across multiple peers. I have been running this version of Bitcoin Core for several months and can confidently state that it's much faster and will saturate your Internet connection. It's even faster than bootstrapping from the historical block file - the bootstrap torrent will no longer be updated because it's pointless as of 0.10

Well, technically the miner (the pool operator when you're mining on a pool) composes the candidate block with the verified transactions and then sends the block header to the workers on the pool for them try try to find the 'solution' which will be a hash of a number of attributes in the block header. The block header contains a hash itself, which is the 'merkle root' hash of all of the included transactions.
I probably didn't do a great job explaining that, but it's a complex process. You can learn more about the details here:

The average Bitcoin user who uses either lightweight wallets or web wallets wouldn't have to do anything. Those of us who run full nodes or are miners would have to decide if we wanted to update our Bitcoin software to be compatible with the proposed changes. 
If you only run a heavyweight client such as Bitcoin Core and you choose not to upgrade, then you would only be able to send your coins to other users who also run clients that are compatible with the legacy version of the protocol and thus the 'old path' as OP calls it.

It will work with either type of disk, however, if you want to maximize your performance, you'll want solid state.

Solid state drives are ~100X faster at accessing a random location on the disk.

Your apartment question is ridiculous because abiding by the contract made between the landlord and tenant is the responsibility of whoever signed the lease. If you're a tenant and you allow other people to live in your apartment, it is YOUR responsibility to ensure that anyone else dwelling in the apartment abides by the terms to which you agreed. If the people who signed the lease both died, I'm fairly sure that a survivor would then have to sign the lease, but IANAL.

I have done a fair amount of analysis of the node network and have written extensively on it.
[Bitcoin Nodes: How Many is Enough?]( 
[How to Set Up a Bitcoin Full Node]( - this also describes how to decide if you should run a node.
[The State of the Bitcoin Network](
If we doubled the number of nodes tomorrow, nothing noticeable would change. We'd simply have a more robust network that is harder to attack. 
If the number of nodes dropped to 10, we'd probably start to have issues. A) Because we'd still have hundreds of thoudsands if not millions of people using the network and their bandwidth needs would be much more concentrated - the nodes would probably buckle under the strain. And B) if only 10 machines were running the entire network it would be trivial for an attacker to Sybil or DoS the nodes.

It's not rare - solving a block with no transactions can actually be an advantage to miners. The resulting smaller size of the block means that it will propagate through the network faster, giving the miner a better chance of winning the block reward in case another miner solves a block at nearly the same time and broadcasts it. The block that reaches the majority of the nodes on the network will end up being the main chain while the losing block will be orphaned.

Each node internally maintains a counter that represents the network time. This is based on the median time of a node's peers which is sent in the version message when peers connect. The network time counter reverts to the system time however if the median time differs by more than 70 minutes from the system time. 
The network time is used to validate new blocks. As a precaution, nodes reject any block timestamp that is greater than 2 hours from the current network time. Block timestamps that are earlier than the median time of the past 11 blocks are also rejected. This validation puts upper and lower bounds on the acceptable range of block timestamps.

In the interest of decentralization, we should prefer that enthusiasts run nodes on their home computers, assuming that they are online 24/7. Having lots of nodes running on VPSes that are hosted by only a handful of providers can lead to a false sense of decentralization.
I'll note that one reason it's not recommended to shut off your node is because when you do so, you lose all of your connectivity and it can take days before your node reaches that level of connectivity again once it rejoins the network due to how peers initiate connections with each other.

A miner "wins" the race to solve the latest block. Though it's not as simple as being the first to solve a block.

I don't think it will be a problem with regard to tx size because IIRC recommended transaction fees are calculated based upon how many kilobytes the transaction takes up. Thus, extremely complex transactions with tons of inputs and outputs tend to require higher fees. 
Now, if you're running a bitcoin service that needs to constantly check the UTXO set, more outputs means that your database index will increase in size. Note that Toshi's high performance database already exceeds 300 GB due to all of the indexing.

Correct. It's all about obfuscation.
Think of it similar to credit cards, though we're talking about privacy rather than security. You use the same credit card info at hundreds or thousands of merchants - it's a single point of failure if any single merchant's database is compromised.
In a similar fashion, if you use the same BTC address for all of your transactions and any single merchant / recipient's database is compromised and thus the address is linked to your identity, it becomes much easier for the attacker to determine other things you've purchased.

It's important to note that when you broadcast a transaction, you are doing so by either connecting to a node and asking it to broadcast the transaction, or broadcasting it yourself from your own node. It is impossible for other nodes on the network to know that you are the first node to broadcast the transaction as opposed to rebroadcasting it after receiving it from another node. Because of this, the likelihood of the transaction being traced back to your IP address as the definitive origin of the transaction is extremely low.

Yes, and in order to use tokens you must first acquire them from a current owner. Also, you must spend the minimum number of tokens as a fee that is required by nodes to relay your transaction. And finally you must compete (due to scarce block space) with the other people sending transactions in order to have your transaction confirmed in a block.

If you're not a professional thief and don't have a black market fence then sure, your logic is sound. OpenBazaar brings ease-of-use to folks who want to fence goods, but I don't agree that it eliminates much of the risk because only the dumbest of thieves get caught trying to fence stolen goods. I'm not so sure that it greatly increases the incentive to steal - it does nothing to eliminate the risk that one undertakes during the act of theft.
Here are some fun facts about theft:
* The clearance rate for burglary is low, with only 12.7% of cases being solved in the United States in 2005.
* In 2005, only 18% of reported cases of larceny/theft were cleared in the United States.

In cryptographic practice, “difficult” generally means “almost certainly beyond the reach of any adversary who must be prevented from breaking the system for as long as the security of the system is deemed important”.

Yes, average transactions per block is around 1900.
I looked back 2 years through my data and the average size has always been around 500 bytes. You're thinking of 260 bytes as being the normal size for a 1 input, 2 output P2PKH transaction.
Multisig transactions are larger depending upon how many signers are involved. A 1 input, 2 output 2-of-3 P2SH transaction usually weighs in at around 360 bytes.
Basically, the more complex the P2SH script, the more 'savings' SegWit provides by offloading that data into the witness portion of the transaction that isn't counted toward the legacy block size limit.

That sounds pretty good; at least you have redundancy and bank vaults tend to be safe against most catastrophes. I'm assuming that each bank is a different company, not just different branches of the same bank. Though you should also determine your threat model - do you want to be secure against agents of the state who would be able to access your safety deposit boxes and online accounts? If so, you'll want additional security around the passphrase and not just leave it unencrypted on Google Drive.

I haven't run any models myself with regard to larger block sizes, but my general thoughts would be as follows:
[We already know]( that at at this time it takes an average sustained downstream usage of ~5 KB/S and upstream of ~50-100 KB/S to run a well-connected node with 100 peers. If we were to see a 20X increase in network activity then this would result in usage of 100 KB/S downstream and 1 - 2 MB/S upstream. I would have no problem serving that from my residential connection.
However, on the bright side, there is plenty of room for optimization. IIRC, [Gavin has a proposal]( that would cut the overall bandwidth usage since at the moment every transaction must be sent across the network twice - once when it is initially broadcast and once again in a block. According to Gavin's estimates, a residential connection could handle tens of thousands of transactions per second if IBLT is implemented.

There are several incentives to run a node. For one, it allows you to have a local copy of the blockchain that you validated yourself. This is absolutely essential for any enterprise that needs to quickly access large amounts of blockchain data. The other incentive is it supports the network. Users may feel that this is necessary out of altruism or they may feel incentivized to protect their investments in Bitcoin.

I think the better question is to ask why such a setup would be desireable in the first place. In general, disk space tends to be more abundant than bandwidth - the average person (or even business) running nodes would saturate their Internet connection long before they would run out of disk space from storing multiple copies of the blockchain.

I don't think you'll find it being refuted because it DOESN'T require an ASIC. However, 21's claim is that it is more convenient: 
My guess as to their claim is that when you sell a device you don't know how long it will be running, if it ever runs at all. So preloading the device with satoshis might be a waste. You COULD have the device 'call home' to the manufacturer to request satoshis, but that could be a point of failure if anything goes wrong on the manufacturer's end. This way the device will always have 'fuel' so long as the Bitcoin network is still functional.
@_date: 2014-12-15 13:40:45
The incentives to run a node are:
1) Support the Bitcoin network. This is analogous to people who seed torrents - they don't directly benefit from doing so.
2) Trust. When you use a lightweight client, you are trusting a third party to give you accurate information about the blockchain. When you use your own node, you don't have to trust anyone because you have verified the information yourself.

It's not possible to say what the average SegWit transaction size will be because it isn't active on mainnet.
Here's a handy chart that shows the breakdown of SegWit transactions and how they increase the block size: 
SegWit creates larger blocks because it "hides" some usage of space from older nodes in a way that doesn't count toward the legacy block size limit. The 1.7 MB figure is based upon estimates of the types of transactions that will be created as SegWit transactions. You can visually compare two block sizes here:

You're going to have to be more specific about what you think is "fair" and "unfair." Back when the people who are now the "Bitcoin 1%" were accumulating coins, you could get them practically for free. Heck, Gavin Andresen ran a bitcoin faucet that gave away tens of thousands of coins (if not more) for free. The people who spent their money purchasing bitcoins back then were taking on an even greater risk than those who do so today, and they have been rewarded.
It sounds like you don't understand how "the system" works. You are welcome to expend your own skills and resources contributing to it, much like those who you consider the "controllers" have.

Closing a payment channel is performed by making another on-chain transaction - essentially you're posting the "latest channel status" off-chain Bitcoin transaction onto the chain.

While this may be a solution from a technical standpoint, it is not a solution from a trust standpoint. It would be further centralizing the trust of the nodes comprising the network.
@_date: 2014-09-05 15:06:36
I completely agree, for multiple reasons. First of all, due to trust - you can't trust any node on the network to be honest other than one that you own. Secondly, due to supporting the infrastructure of a service that one's business relies upon.
With regard to "if it will be a problem" - I think that very few businesses that accept bitcoin as payments are running nodes. This is due to the advent of large bitcoin payment processors such as Bitpay and Coinbase. Merchants have no need to run a node because they are trusting the payment processors.
@_date: 2015-05-05 13:58:00
People who are worried about the declining number of nodes may be interested in reading my posts "[Bitcoin Nodes: How Many is Enough?]( and "[The State of the Bitcoin Network](
As for incentives: some people run nodes out of altruism or because they understand the need for people to support the network - there's an indirect incentive to do so.
However, any business that relies upon the block chain will want a copy (preferably multiple copies) of the ledger that they have verified themselves. Especially those that are parsing the block chain for specific data - it's orders of magnitude faster to do so on a local copy than by querying nodes over the network.
My perspective is that the decline in nodes that we see is of the altruistic users who are switching to lightweight clients for everyday use. However, underneath the declining number of altruistic nodes is a foundation of nodes that are run out of necessity by enterprises.

He was assuming linear growth. If Bitcoin only grows linearly for the next 10 years, it's probably a failure.
However, it's also worth noting that as Bitcoin payment processors become more popular, more and more transactions occur off-blockchain and thus do not contribute to the growth in the size of the blockchain.

It's complicated because you're getting into the low level details of the protocol.

There are a number of differences, but my understanding is that one of the key differences is that the number of bitcoins held by the BIT (which is what underlies GBTC) is fairly static (it's difficult to add more.) Whereas it should be easier for an ETF to buy more bitcoins. As such, when demand surges for GBTC it just results in a huge premium over the actual bitcoin price. But if there is a demand surge for an ETF, they will buy more bitcoins, thus raising the global exchange rate for coins rather than having a premium.
Also, GBTC only trades on the OTCQX market with very low liquidity. An ETF on a more popular market with high liquidity would be far superior for institutions to use.
Some IRAs, but not all, allow access to the OTCQX market.

Miners can pick and choose which transactions to verify. They generally do this based upon the tx fees and upon the "age" of the coins being spent.

They took some care to not obviously fork Peercoin's GitHub project, yet it's clear from viewing their commit history that it's a Peercoin clone with minimal modification, while the "Prime Nodes" and "Orion Controllers" are simply Proof of Stake mechanisms to make GAW richer. Did GAW really think that they would be able to fool those of us who are programmers? The code doesn't lie.

Not by a long shot.

The beauty of the system is that users don't have to believe in the ideology in order to benefit from the technology.

It sounds like you don't understand the difference between ASICs and computers.
A [computer]( is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.
On the other hand, an [application-specific integrated circuit]( (ASIC) is an integrated circuit customized for a particular use, rather than intended for general-purpose use.
ASICs are not supercomputers.

Full nodes are what keep copies of the blockchain, ensuring its integrity and availability.

It's a trade-off. If all of the merchants using payment processors were processing their own bitcoins, we'd have an order of magnitude more nodes running the network, making it harder to attack. However, it's unlikely that many of the merchants would go to the trouble of writing their own bitcoin payment processing software.

Right - but just to be clear, having a hardcoded payout address is not the same as the chips actually "mining for 21" in the sense that 21 is in control of the work the chips are performing.
At this point it's still unclear whether or not 21 will actually be controlling the chips - that particular detail will determine whether or not 21 is a threat to the network in terms of being able to perform a computational attack.

Because it works the other way around. Miners look at the exchange rate and THEN decide how many resources they are willing to devote to mining. The difficulty algorithm is set up such that miners will compete ruthlessly until they operate at the brink of profitability.

The claim is that one line of code was changed in Bitstamp's codebase. Not that the entire integration was a single line of code. Thus my explanation for how the functional code is all on BitGo's end and Bitstamp is simply loading it into their system.

The counts reported by Bitnodes now are only of nodes that are accepting inbound connections - it used to count every single IP address that it found by querying nodes about what peers they were aware of. I estimate that there are likely somewhere between 20,000 and 100,000 nodes in total.

A wallet could check the blockchain to see if the address has ever been used, though this isn't a guarantee that no one has generated the same private key. It basically comes down to the odds of someone else having done so. Here's one graphic to help visualize:

It depends upon how the miner is mining. If they're just hooking up to a pool then they're not running a node (except I think in the case of p2pool) - the invention of pooled mining made mining and running a node a 1-to-N relationship rather than a 1-to-1 relationship.

1) As for security, the best step is to simply not run your node as a wallet. You can do this by passing -disablewallet as a command when starting bitcoind or by adding "disablewallet=1" as a line to bitcoin.conf
2) For monitoring, I recommend setting up alerts from bitnodes.io - I will note that you may occasionally receive false downtime alerts, though you'll usually receive a "node is back up" alert within a few minutes if it was a hiccough.
And I'd be remiss if I didn't plug my own project, Statoshi. If you really want to dig into the statistics of what your node is doing, you can run my Bitcoin Core fork. You can check out my public dashboard at  - click on "WTF" to learn more about the project.

You paid 12.5 satoshis per byte on that transaction while the average transaction is paying over 30 satoshis per byte. Perhaps most miners think 12.5 isn't worth their while.

Time has value. Information has value. Spending your time and skills / knowledge while communicating to people through the internet can convey value to other people. If they wish to give you some value via cryptocurrency in return, I see no problem with that. 
If microtransactions become popular, I could see people making a decent living by providing value through such communication. If someone makes a post that is worth $0.10 to thousands of people who decide to tip the post, that's a non-negligible profit - everybody wins. It's really not that different from posting a popular YouTube video or article on which you post ads that generate revenue, it's just a more straightforward method of generating the revenue.

Certainly; it will be interesting to watch over the long term which progresses faster: resource consumption of Bitcoin's infrastructure or the cost to run the resources. Not just in bandwidth, but in disk storage and CPU use as well.
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:53:37
Yes, the headers are under 30 MB, but the headers are just the map that your node then uses to download the actual blockchain. You still need to download and verify 30+ GB of data, which takes a few hours.
You don't need to be connected to other 0.10 nodes to download blocks in parallel.
I will note that syncing slows down after block 295000 because the node becomes CPU-bound performing ECDSA validation.
One syncing test I ran a few months ago had these results:
* 6 minutes sync to block height 100,000
* 22 minutes to reach height 200,000
* 62 minutes to reach height 250,000
* 125 minutes to reach height 295,000
* 144 minutes to reach height 300,000
* 248 minutes to reach height 325,000

Good questions.
1. You can run your own KRS, though you'll need to go through a vetting and contractual process before we're going to enable people to create a BitGo wallet using your KRS.
2. We can't technically block a KRS from signing a transaction - this is where the legal contracts come into play. A KRS would be in violation of their contract and would be liable for any damages. It's not that the KRS is notifying us of a "double spend" but rather that they notify us if a user requests the KRS sign /any/ transaction in order to perform a withdrawal from a BitGo wallet.
I don't think it's quite accurate to say that BitGo Instant is "trustless" - it's a different type of trust model. From the perspective of a recipient of an Instant transaction, they are "trusting" that we will uphold our guarantee. You could say that we're "trusting" our KRS will uphold their contract, but of course the contract is "backed" by the legal system.
@_date: 2016-01-12 23:23:41
Interesting timing - I'm actually currently working on a blog post about the cost to run a node and how we need to develop a min spec in order to better gauge what level of transactions / size of blocks the network could handle before a ton of people start shutting down their nodes.

No fees for anyone the first 60 days, after which they will use a market maker / taker model.

You don't want multiple instances of Bitcoin Core writing to the same blockchain as you'd get corrupted files.

I can't think of a reason offhand why that would occur normally. I don't see a recurring spike in both upstream and downstream like your graph shows; my downstream is steady while the upstream is spiky: 
Are you sure there aren't any other processes on your machine that are consuming bandwidth?
It's possible that you have a peer that is sending and requesting a lot of data from you on a recurring basis; does the usage pattern continue if you restart the node and thus connect to different peers?

Some people run nodes out of altruism or because they understand the need for people to support the network - there's an indirect incentive to do so.
However, any business that relies upon the block chain will want a copy (preferably multiple copies) of the ledger that they have verified themselves. Especially those that are parsing the block chain for specific data - it's orders of magnitude faster to do so on a local copy than by querying nodes over the network. Therein lies the direct incentive to run nodes.
My perspective is that the decline in nodes that we see is of the altruistic users who are switching to lightweight clients for everyday use. However, underneath the declining number of altruistic nodes is a foundation of nodes that are run out of necessity by enterprises.

libsecp256k1 had sped up initial sync (and all signature validation) 5X
segwit will also speed up initial sync, possibly even more, by allowing skipping of signature validation.
But as I noted at the end - it should be possible to have a node start up in SPV mode while the initial sync is occurring in the background. The desired end goal would be for the user not to care how long the initial sync takes because they don't notice a difference between the functionality while it's syncing and after it has completed syncing.

Sure, I'm making no complaints about your review - I've just never seen this definition of custodial wallet before.

BitGo employee here - we aren't a custodial wallet and I'll explain why. Here's the definition that CoinCenter (and the industry in general) uses to define custodial wallets:


Since BitGo only ever controls 1 of a user's 3 keys, we never have the ability to unilaterally execute or prevent execution of transaction creation for a BitGo wallet. Hope that clears things up!

"Big blocker" and "small blocker" are poorly defined. Even most self professed "small blockers" I've spoken with believe that eventually Bitcoin will need larger blocks. The contention is just around how quickly larger blocks are needed.
@_date: 2016-01-06 20:16:38
Don't accept any argument that "blocks aren't full because the average block size is only X"
This is because even when blocks are completely full, the average block size generally doesn't exceed 800KB. Take, for example, this day during which blocks were completely full: 
This is for several reasons:
1. Some miners set their soft caps lower than 1 MB
2. Some pools such as Eligius have much stricter rules around which transactions they mine because they consider a wide variety of transaction attributes to flag a transaction as "spam" and thus mine smaller blocks.
3. Empty blocks sometimes get mined immediately after a new block, because the miner has not had a chance to update their mempool to remove the recently confirmed transactions. Rather than potentially creating an invalid block that confirms an already-confirmed transaction, they start mining an empty block that only contains the coinbase transaction. The empty blocks pull down the "average block size" significantly.
A better metric to judge the fullness of blocks is the size of the mempool - the backlog of unconfirmed transactions.

My point is that there are reasons for which blocks are generated that are well below the hard cap even when there is a significant backlog, thus the use of average block size as evidence that "blocks aren't full" is flawed.

Trying to tell a human what fee to add to a transaction is impossible unless you have access to their UTXOs. As such, fee estimates should only be provided by the wallet itself, not some external service that will have to make assumptions that will inevitably be wrong.

Units of bitcoins are not CURRENTLY divisible smaller than 1 satoshi, but it would be a trivial change to the protocol to support further divisibility past 8 decimal places.

I checked a number of testnet block explorers and they all agree with each other except not with blockr.

Change output ordering is a legitmate privacy issue that I covered in my post: "[The Challenges of Unspent Output Selection](
As BitGo CTO Ben Davenport answered on HN, we're aware of the privacy issue but haven't been able to address it until a recent upgrade that we rolled out to our infrastructure. Also, transactions sent from multi-sig to single-sig addresses [such as the one in Blocktrail's blog post]( are going to be painfully obvious which output is the change - it's the only output to a multi-sig address - randomizing the output order won't help much in that case.

From an end user standpoint it doesn't matter if a miner generates a block that is smaller than the hard cap due to technical, moral, or philosophical reasons - the effect is the same. It's capacity that is not being utilized, which means the capacity effectively does not exist for the end user. Which is why the mempool size is a better metric - it indicates demand for capacity that is not being met.

Indeed - I think it should be fairly straightforward to come to a consensus about technical min specs - the more contentious facet will likely be the actual cost. If a cost of, for example, $200 for the hardware is settled upon, it should also automatically be adjusted to account for inflation. As the currency inflates and tech costs deflate, the min spec will allow for more and more powerful machines to be required while not actually changing the spec.

That really doesn't matter if the transaction never gets propagated to the miners. The default relay fee is 1 satoshi per byte: 
As such, transactions that pay under 1 satoshi per byte (such as OP's) will probably not even make it to the miners in the first place.
Even if it did make it, such a low fee transaction would be constantly at the very bottom of a miner's priority queue and given that blocks are consistently full these days, it may never get within the top 1MB of highest fee paying transactions in the mempool.
@_date: 2016-06-01 12:16:03

It's really just a terminology issue - I agree that it's better for the network if your node accepts incoming connections, but to be precise a fully validating node that doesn't accept incoming connections is still a "full node."

It's hard to say what went wrong without looking at your wallet. Several common reasons for seeing this are:
1. Your wallet is full of many tiny value outputs, which results in creating a large data size transaction that requires a lot of mining fees.
2. Your wallet contains unconfirmed outputs that we don't allow you to spend because they're not really "yours" yet.
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:28:29
If you created your wallet with a unique "secondary password" then it is your "wallet password" for the purposes of the recovery tool. If entering it into the recovery tool as a secondary password is failing, the best thing to do would be to create a support ticket for us to investigate your wallet further.

Your node will handle that automatically. The more reliable your node is, the more peers that will connect to it over the long run. If your node hits resource limits then it will find a natural limit to the number of peers it can support. I really wouldn't worry about the specific number of peers.

1) Miners are free to run Lightning nodes and collect fees. 
2) Low Lightning Network fees will incentivize higher on-chain fees. 
If Lightning Network allows a user to reduce their on-chain transactions by a factor of X, then it makes economic sense for a user to be willing to pay any fee that is less than AVERAGE_BITCOIN_FEE * X - AVERAGE_LIGHTNING_FEE * X.

Because fee estimate algorithms only care about the fee rate in satoshis per byte, that fee rate tends to stay flat if transaction volume stays flat, regardless of changes to the exchange rate. As such, if the exchange rate goes up so do fees. Vice versa if the exchange rate drops.

A node can receive a transaction that's unconfirmed or that's part of a block. It will perform the same validations either way - the only difference is that if it's being validated as being confirmed in a block and is found to be invalid, the node will reject both the transaction and the block. If you want to learn more about how miners select transactions to be included in a block, there are additional complexities there and miners can have custom selection logic. Hashing to find a valid block hash is mostly unrelated to transaction validation and selection - that is, a mining pool will update their candidate block header every so often (probably every few seconds) but certainly not for every incremented nonce that is attempted (which can happen many many times per second)

The current elevated mempool size didn't happen suddenly; it has built up over the past couple days. This behavior is also consistent with what would happen if there was merely an increase in adoption that pushed transaction volume past the tipping point of what can be confirmed in blocks.
@_date: 2016-12-25 14:59:34
A few use cases I wrote down: 
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:24:50
A node receives an "invitation" message from a peer saying that it has a new transaction hash X, inviting the node to request it. If the node doesn't have X, it sends a "gettransaction" request for it and then the peer sends the entire transaction. Once the transaction is received over the wire, the node then checks that all of the inputs are available to be spent, that the signatures to spend them are valid, and many many other consensus rules. If any check fails then the node simply throws the transaction away. Otherwise, if the transaction is valid then the node updates its database to reflect the new state of transactions and unspent outputs and sends out an "invitation" message to all its peer nodes, notifying them that it has a new transaction X that they may request to learn about. This is how the transactions (and blocks) propagate around the network via what's known as a "gossip protocol."

Bitcoin is so tiny that organic growth can easily seem huge from a relative perspective. For example, if 0.004% of Indians decided to try out bitcoin due to their recent currency issues, that would easily create this much of a backlog. Not saying that's what happened, but just to put things in perspective.
If we agree that "normal usage" appears to be fairly random, then an attacker who wants to hide what they're doing will be striving for maximum entropy. So I suppose a sufficiently sophisticated attacker is indistinguishable from normal traffic.
... which leads us to the problem of organic growth potentially being indistinguishable from an attack. It would be easy to dismiss growth spurts as being attacks, which I find unfortunate.

I'm using the timestamps at which the blocks are received, not the block header timestamps.

No. A miner could give you a signed transaction that spends the coinbase (timelocked or otherwise) but it can't be broadcast until the block is 100 deep; the miner could always create a different transaction that sends the coins elsewhere.
It would probably be better if the miner mined a block with a coinbase transaction that spent to a multisig p2sh output where each party controls a key possibly a neutral third party controls a key. That way you could prevent unilateral theft / breaking of the sale agreement.

Confirmations are just how many blocks have been added to the blockchain once your transaction is added. It's unrelated to the number of nodes.

You could sync a full node yourself and them simply stop the node once it reaches the height you want. If you're familiar with bash scripting it wouldn't be hard to automate a call to "bitcoin-cli stop" once a target block height is reached.

It's up to the user; you can sweep all UTXOs in one transaction or select specific ones. In general we expect that someone who is using a multisig vault won't have a ton of UTXOs. If you're transacting frequently then you should probably be using our single sig wallet or lightning wallet.
If you wish to perform additional integrity checks regarding the new destination address, you can create a watch-only wallet in other software such as electrum from all of the extended public keys on your devices and then check that the generated receive address matches the destination address for the sweep transaction.

It's not meant to be an ecosystem-wide enforced cap - it's an individual cap resulting from competition between miners and based upon what they find they can individually support. Miners that can support larger blocks without having them orphaned will earn more revenue by collecting more fees.

Indeed; the code is already written. Which codebase it's patched into is irrelevant; I can patch it into my Statoshi fork of Bitcoin Core if I so desire. This is what I've been trying to explain to people for a while - don't confuse Bitcoin implementations with the Bitcoin protocol itself. No implementation has a technical monopoly over development of the protocol.
@_date: 2015-08-26 12:22:06
I haven't completely decided what I think about BIP100 because the code hasn't been published and there are still questions around how the block size adjustment will be calculated, but at a high level I think both BIP100 and BIP101 make sense, they just go about it in different ways. From my perspective:
* BIP100: miners maintain a transaction fee market by voting on an adjustable system-wide hard cap that maxes out at 32MB. It's unlikely, but possible that we could reach 32MB blocks in only 1 year after BIP100 activates.
* BIP101: miners maintain a transaction fee market by setting individual soft caps and competing against other miners as hard cap grows at a predictable rate to 8GB in 2036.
It seems to me that regardless of what block size limit algorithm is chosen, miners will always have the freedom to set their soft caps lower if they deem it to give them a competitive advantage. The question in my mind is this: is it healthier to have a market where miners can force their competitors to create smaller blocks or is it healthier to have miners compete voluntarily with a hard cap that is primarily for DoS protection?

You can voice your opinion to the Bitcoin Core developers, but to be honest the block size debate has been pretty much beaten to death by this point.

There are no fees paid by the recipient (such as by a merchant) which makes Bitcoin a different fee system than credit cards.

Setting a connection limit will not guarantee a bandwidth cap because you could still have a new peer come online and request a ton of historical block from you, thus saturating your upstream bandwidth.

That's a tough one - it will vary from node to node depending upon their connectivity. I find that my node uses the most bandwidth when peers that are far behind request tons of historical blocks from me.

You're comparing two very, very different things. As I stated, the network is never down - bitcoin transactions that get broadcast during periods of high volume don't get rejected, their confirmation or "settlement" just gets deferred.

Everyone decides what the protocol is. Yes, different implementations will need to remain compatible with regard to the consensus rules. That's why consensus changes shouldn't be deployed without sufficient warning or without mechanisms to ensure that the ecosystem is in consensus.

No. Even if there was a way for a node to sign new 'merged' transactions the fundamental problem is that every transaction spends unique inputs and sends to unique outputs that cannot be feasibly "merged" or "deduplicated."

Unlikely, because a node has 120 incoming connection slots by default.  I've never seen any of my nodes max them out. I usually see a max of around 100 but it takes over a week of constant connectivity to build up that many.

The consensus mechanisms of the Bitcoin ecosystem are fairly complex but result in a robust system of checks and balances.
Miners don't have all of the power because nodes can reject the blocks they solve. Miners aren't going to start publishing blocks that will get rejected. Also, the economic participants in the ecosystem have power. Miners aren't going to publish blocks on a fork that isn't supported by exchanges, merchants, and users in general. This is because it's a terrible business decision to mine blocks if you can't use the coinbase reward to pay for your operating expenses.
Developers, on the other hand, have the power to suggest how we steer the future of the system, but they must convince the rest of the participants to adopt their suggested changes.

Connectivity is already an issue, though it doesn't mean large miners have better connectivity - just look at the largest miners in China who are on unreliable connections. Some of them are mining without verifying parent blocks, some mine lots of empty blocks, and overall they are the most opposed to increased block sizes. It seems to me that we should be focused more on getting constant time block propagation built into the protocol, though I haven't heard much from Gavin recently about his IBLT work.

Your node won't broadcast its address (necessary for other nodes to know about it and connect to it) until it has finished the initial sync.
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:55:27
Good point; it seems to me that the logic for including a transaction in a block should be if the revenue (fee) exceeds the cost (risk of the additional data size orphaning the block due to slower propagation.)
@_date: 2015-08-11 14:27:15
No, AFAIK no one is actively voting against it in their coinbase scripts. To be clear, this is not any automated vote of any sort that would change the protocol - it's just a show of support.

If you run a full node then the blockchain could potentially grow ~1,100 MB per day /if/ all the blocks are full AND all miners choose to mine 8 MB blocks. In reality it will likely start growing at a much slower rate.
Note that most wallets these days are not full nodes.
@_date: 2015-08-12 12:14:57
Miners can't single-handedly "give us" larger blocks - they have to be accepted by nodes and by the major economic players in the system. This is merely a signal that another one of the pieces of the system is beginning to support the concept of larger blocks.

It's not quite that simple. You're using the past to predict the future, which doesn't always work.
The problem I've been dealing with a lot recently is the situation where a user creates and broadcasts a transaction and then in the period between that transaction being broadcast and the next block being solved, a new wave of higher fee transactions gets broadcast. Now the user's transaction is stuck at the back of a very long line and there's no way to have prevented it other than by setting the fee to be a lot higher than "market conditions" were at the time it was created.

Transactions are not guaranteed to have propagated throughout the network, especially if the miner that solves the block has a relationship with a third party who submits transactions directly to them.

That's a complicated question because it depends up how well connected your node is. My node with 100 peers uses an average of 10 KB/S downstream &amp; 100 KB/S upstream.

Nodes do play a part in consensus in that they validate blocks from miners. If the node doesn't agree that a miner's block is valid according to its consensus rules, it will reject the block and refuse to relay it to other nodes.
@_date: 2015-07-23 02:14:08
It depends upon the wallet. For wallets that don't have dynamic fees it does effectively stop people from spending their coins. For people using wallets that allow manual selection of fees but who are unaware of the current status of the network, it would also hinder them because they don't know that they should increase their fees.

It's a plausible explanation, but it can't be verified.






I disagree in the sense that it /is/ possible for them to follow the process they outlined in order to keep the data secure from internal attackers.

The largest spikes in upload bandwidth occur when a peer that is far behind on the chain requests a large number of historical blocks; if you are a little slower to serve up those historical blocks then you aren't hurting anything as of today. In the past this would be suboptimal because nodes wouldn't parallelize their downloading of blocks from multiple peers, but as of Bitcoin Core 0.10 they do.
Though if you can only relay a full 1 MB block in ~8 seconds, that's not great. As you say, other nodes should pick up the slack.
@_date: 2015-07-25 22:57:31
No transactions have been broadcast with outputs depositing into 39K96soAFi8Jsn7k888pUTSVgDseyjAGj8 - either you're using a fake Bitcoin client that is lying to you about what it's doing or you're lying and trying to get people to send funds to that address which is actually controlled by you.

Long story short, if you just want to "go along with the crowd" then you shouldn't need to do anything. By default everyone and services will remain on the current chain. If there is a groundswell of support for the new chain then services will switch over on their own and should update their software accordingly.
I don't know how Trezor works at a low level but my understanding is that it's just a key signing device; thus it's likely chain-agnostic - the wallet you use the Trezor with would have to be updated to switch to a new chain. If it's a web wallet like MyTrezor then the update will happen on their end, not yours.

If there is consensus that it is acceptable to increase block sizes as resources become faster and cheaper, it seems to me that we have a problem given that there is no established baseline for the acceptable performance / hardware cost requirements to run a node.

You lost me. The network is never 'down' and you can always continue to listen to the transactions on the network to compare your fees to theirs. Thus, you can know in realtime what the 'going rate' is for fees. This is basically what we have today from Bitcoin Core's fee estimation RPC function, however my point is that you cannot actually update (yet) the fee on a transaction after it is broadcast in order to adjust it in the face of highly dynamic market conditions.

@_date: 2015-08-13 11:23:55
"Use the right fees" is not a silver bullet. First off, fee estimation code is slow to adjust because it's looking at trailing data over the past couple hundred blocks to see what fees resulted in confirmation after X blocks. Also, fee estimation can't predict the future - if you broadcast a transaction with an appropriate fee according to the fee estimation, but a new wave of transactions has been broadcast with a slightly higher fee in the past few hours, you're screwed. Now you're at the back of a long line with no way to adjust your fee to get to the front. And you're doubly screwed if you don't have any extra confirmed UTXO in your wallet, because then you have to spend your unconfirmed UTXO meaning that the transactions spending them can't possibly be confirmed until after the parent transaction is confirmed.

It's hard to say based upon this information because fees are not based upon value sent, they're based upon the data size of the transaction. BitGo should allow you to choose from several different fee priorities as well.
Also, if you're wanting to send smaller amounts of money (like under $100) then I'd suggest looking into using Lightning Network to save a lot more on fees.

Regardless of whether or not it processed "in time" for the payment processor's invoice, the payment processor definitely has the money. Thus the vendor should receive the money.

Sure, trying to predict the future of a system in 20 years is impossible. But it's not locked in; it, like any other aspect of the protocol, can be changed. I will pose to you, however, that if you want to build a system where every human can own a UTXO on the blockchain, we will need 8 GB blocks.

Unfortunately the block size debate has become less about the technical aspects of supporting larger block sizes and more about the ideological aspects of whether or not it will affect centralization by preventing people from running nodes, and about the "governance" of the Bitcoin protocol itself with regard to hard forks.

Thanks for the mention - I looked into it and it turns out that the problem was that I was displaying the metric for all transaction messages received as opposed to the metric for valid transactions that are accepted. Thus it was also displaying rejected transactions. I've updated the charts to only render the metrics for accepted transactions now.

You should assume that any service touting Bitcoin "investing" is a scam, because most of them are. Do your due diligence.
The only service I'm aware of that seems like it might NOT be a scam is  but I can't vouch for them, nor have I looked into them very deeply.
TL;DR: Bitcoin /is/ the investment. You don't invest an investment unless you want even higher risks / rewards.
@_date: 2015-07-30 22:30:39
Well, it's not quite that simple - the larger the block that a miner publishes, the longer it takes to propagate through the network. The longer a block takes to propagate through the network, the higher the chance that it will be orphaned by a smaller block published by a competing miner. So there is a balance - miners want to publish smaller blocks to ensure that they get the (much larger) block reward.

Actually, the entire point is that the signatures / witnesses can be safely pruned away after the block has been buried under sufficient proof of work. Bitcoin Core already skips signature checks during initial sync for old blocks that will clearly never get orphaned.

If you stop a syncing node at a given block height then you end up with a snapshot at that point in time as you described. I doubt you'll be able to find someone who just happened to turn their node off on that day and hasn't turned it back on since.

A pruned node can't serve historical blocks or serve SPV clients older data. The problem is that there isn't currently a way for pruned nodes to tell other nodes what data they are able to serve, thus it's safer for them just to not advertise being able to serve any data.

The major difference in assumptions between the two figures are how often people will want to settle on-blockchain. The 133MB figure assumes twice per year; the 10GB figure assumes 1 per day.

Indeed, upgrading production software is like swapping out an airplane engine mid-flight. That's why great care must be taken to ensure that the maintenance occurs without causing any turbulence - optimally the passengers won't even notice it happened. This is true for all large scale software systems that can't have downtime. If you never upgrade the system, the only option is to wait for superior systems built from scratch to come along and then you lose all your customers when they migrate.

Good question! I'm only aware of one web service that makes searching by prefix possible, though it's not entirely user-friendly.
Check out 
You can use a query like this to find transaction outputs by their to address and use a wildcard to search for prefixes:
    SELECT *
    FROM TransactionOutput 
    WHERE ToAddress LIKE '1prefix%'
Note that this isn't /exactly/ what you asking for because it's searching all transaction outputs, not just unspent outputs. Unfortunately it looks like this service doesn't provide access to address balances, or you could set up a JOIN operation to filter out addresses with non-zero balances.

Ever since headers-first parallelized block downloading was implemented a few years ago, it's faster to sync via Bitcoin's p2p network than by downloading a bootstrap file via torrent. That's why the bootstrap files haven't been updated in a long time. Most folks will find that the syncing bottlenecks are either their memory or their ISP's bandwidth. Setting dbcache to use most of your RAM tends to speed up the initial sync immensely. On a top of the line PC with gigabit fiber I've been able to do a sync in 2.5 hours. On a Raspberry Pi it will take a couple weeks.

If the node has stalled for some reason, it's probably not safe to assume that it's updating peer chain heights. Basically you need to build some external "source of truth" that is fault tolerant.

This is tricky because nodes aren't guaranteed to be in sync. A naive load balancer that only checks if the node is responding to requests will result in the creation of a bunch of edge cases. In my experience you'll want to write a smart health check daemon that compares the data / block heights of your nodes with multiple external sources in order to remove nodes that are not healthy from the load balancer.

I don't think pruned nodes accept incoming connections; at the very least I don't think they advertise as being able to serve blocks. At most you will help relay blocks and transactions in realtime to a handful of peers to which you have connected.
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:08:05
Can bitnodes see your node? 
If so, you're good. You probably won't get many incoming connections for a while - it takes time for your node's address to propagate around the network.

@_date: 2019-09-23 14:55:02
There are services such as BlockCypher that have APIs to get the "confidence" than an unconfirmed transaction will be confirmed. Essentially it's an algorithm that listens for double spends on the network and looks at other attributes of the transaction such as the fee rate and if it has unconfirmed parent transactions.
Each confirmation makes it exponentially more difficult to double spend a transaction because you have far more proof of work that needs to be expended in order to reorganize the blockchain.
LN is complicated; you're basically updating unconfirmed transactions privately between yourself and your channel counterparties. The only reason it works is because if your channel counterparty tries to cheat you, you can "steal" back your money by settling on the blockchain.

It's all about security. If your system is set up in such a way that an attacker compromising your server could result in a loss of funds, you're running a high risk operation. Distributing the keys to unlock funds across multiple machines via multi-sig addresses is the easiest way to prevent this.

Are you running 0.10? It syncs much faster than previous versions. But still, you need to download 30+ GB of data, so it will depend a lot upon your internet connection. Also, the process of verifying all of the data is fairly CPU intensive, so the speed of your CPU will affect it as well.

You can get some really cheap VPSes at the moment but as the size of the blockchain continues to grow, you'll have to upgrade to a higher tier VPS that's more expensive.

No, sidechains do not involve destroying bitcoins. There are some protocols such as Counterparty that rely upon destroying bitcoins via Proof of Burn.

My first guess is that you have a bug in your "generate new send address" logic. If you're doing this all with a single regtest node, I'd recommend you set up a second node with a different wallet. It's pretty easy to run multiple regtest instances on a single machine, you just need to configure them to use distinct data directories and ports.

The old wallet will work fine IF you haven't performed new transactions on the encrypted wallet. It's generally not recommended to keep the unencrypted wallet around. The reason for this is that the keypool gets flushed when you encrypt a Bitcoin Core wallet.

We certainly have different perspectives. Perhaps mine is different because I am the sole "dictator" of a Bitcoin implementation. If I wanted to, I could commit consensus changes to it. But those changes would be worthless unless I could convince a lot of the ecosystem to adopt them. And even if I convinced the ecosystem to adopt my first set of changes, I would have to continue to convince it to adopt future changes.
Long story short, being a "dictator" of a Bitcoin implementation does not give someone as much power as you might believe. You can't force changes upon the ecosystem and the switching costs are low for node operators to exit to a different implementation if they find it to be more appealing.

There is no "head of Bitcoin" - my entire point is that many people seem to have equated Core with the Bitcoin protocol merely because it has been where the majority of development has happened historically. From a technical standpoint, there is no reason why development progress must be constrained to the Core implementation.
I did advocate for BIP101 in Bitcoin Core and still do, but when it became clear that no forward progress was going to be made in Core, I was happy to support it in a different implementation.
I don't think that resistance to switching is the same as high switching costs; people have plenty of reasons to stick to the time-tested Core implementation. There are no guarantees that open source code is policed carefully in any codebase - just look at OpenSSL, for example.
As for wise leadership, I'm simply advocating for more competition and a decentralization of technical leadership. I think it would be healthier for the ecosystem to have a diversity of implementations, each with a diversity of review processes and leadership philosophies.

The old wallet will work fine IF you haven't performed new transactions on the encrypted wallet. As soon as you do perform txs on the encrypted wallet, it will diverge from the unencrypted wallet.
When you set an encryption key for your wallet, all unused keys in it get marked as used, so they won't be handed out to satisfy requests for new addresses.  This is to keep you from getting money sent to potentially unsafe keys.  However, the keys are not marked invalid or discarded, so if you do manage to get one (using pywallet or db_dump or something), you can still use money sent to it.
Now, with all of the keys marked as used, your node needs to generate a bunch of new keys for the keypool, so that it can give you addresses without asking for the encryption key again.  This means that your wallet now has a bunch of keys in it that are not in the backup you made before encrypting.  If you ask for a new key, and then restore from your backup, any money sent to that key will be lost and gone forever.  So, right about now is a very good time to try to scare you into making a new backup.
The reason the message says that your wallet won't work any more is because people don't want to read a detailed essay on wallet key and backup management.  The message just needs to convince people to make new backups, not necessarily go into all of the gory details about how and why.

So in order to fix this, give each bitcoind a unique set of ports when you start it:
    $ ./bitcoind -regtest -daemon -datadir=/tmp/test1/ -rpcport=18000 -port=18001
    $ ./bitcoind -regtest -daemon -datadir=/tmp/test2/ -rpcport=18002 -port=18003
Then you can use bitcoin-cli with the appropriate params to talk to each instance separately:
    $ ./bitcoin-cli -regtest -datadir=/tmp/test1/ -rpcport=18000 getblockchaininfo
    $ ./bitcoin-cli -regtest -datadir=/tmp/test2/ -rpcport=18002 getblockchaininfo
In order to connect the nodes together you should call addnode with the p2p port of the other instance:
    $ ./bitcoin-cli -regtest -datadir=/tmp/test1/ -rpcport=18000 addnode 127.0.0.1:18003 onetry
Then you can verify that the nodes are connected via:
    $ ./bitcoin-cli -regtest -datadir=/tmp/test1/ -rpcport=18000 getpeerinfo
If you're familiar with bash then you'll find it's a lot easier to create aliases for the above commands; you can create something like "bitcoin-cli-node1" and "bitcoin-cli-node2" for example so that you can then use each of them directly while only having to pass the last RPC params.

Miners are meant to compete with regard to being able to solving a block **and** publishing it to the network faster than other miners. Network connections already play a part in that competition, which is why we saw a great deal of pushback from Chinese miners regarding Gavin's 20MB proposed limit.

If there is sufficient adoption, yes. But that's not my point.

If the other 79% of blocks vote for a value higher than a 20% reduction then the 20% reduction will only be the 21st percentile and will not win. In this case you'd need another 59% of blocks to vote for a value smaller than the current limit in order for the limit to decrease.

If you don't have a dedicated online computer on which you can install a node, a low power device like a Raspberry Pi or Bitseed is preferable because they use ~10% the electricity of a full fledged desktop / laptop. I have a Bitseed and can attest that all you really need to do is plug it in and forget it's there.
FYI this is the most comprehensive guide to running a node I'm aware of:

To be clear, I'm not referring to area codes. Law enforcement can geolocate cell phones without much difficulty regardless of the actual phone number. They can also (somewhat) trace virtual phone numbers - that's how my local department traced the call to a VOIP server that was running at a data center in Texas.
The line between suspicious and plausible won't be clear. My main point with "red flagging" is that any officers that get sent to a location should be alerted that there are red flags indicating that the call may be fraudulent and they should thus proceed with caution so as to not /create/ victims.

According to the [Paycoin Whitepaper]( Prime Controllers would automatically adjust the creation of paycoins to meet market demand, resulting in exchange rate stability.

If you're running on Linux you can use the QoS script provided in the repository at 
Other options may include throttling the machine running the node at the router level, or using other bandwidth throttling software for whatever OS you run.
I find that even a [well connected node]( with 100+ peers only uses ~5 KB/S downstream and ~100 KB/S upstream, though that's average use - in reality the usage is rather spiky. It is possible to saturate your upstream if a peer starts requesting large numbers of blocks from you.

I haven't forgotten it. I disagree with plenty of Mike Hearn's ideas. But I'm not following a man, I'm following code. If Mike decides to implement code in XT with which I disagree, then I won't run it.
Perhaps my perspective is different because I am the sole "dictator" of a Bitcoin implementation (Statoshi.) If I wanted to, I could commit consensus changes to it. But those changes would be worthless unless I could convince a lot of the ecosystem to adopt them. And even if I convinced the ecosystem to adopt my first set of changes, I would have to continue to convince it to adopt future changes.
Long story short, being a "dictator" of a Bitcoin implementation does not give someone as much power as you might believe. You can't force changes upon the ecosystem and the switching costs are low for node operators to exit to a different implementation if they find it to be more appealing.

There is no standard for "priority" in the sense that you're referring to blockchain.info's description. There used to be a measure of "priority" in terms of coin age, but miners generally disregard it now and prioritize transactions based upon their fee rate per bytes of transaction data. 
TL;DR each miner can use their own algorithm to prioritize which transactions to add to their blocks. Also, it's not about the flat fee amount but rather the fee RATE, which I don't think blockchain.info displays. Use tradeblock if you want to see the fee rate.

Now, there are several different ways that you can create a wallet with us. The easiest is to do it all in your web browser. This is the riskiest because it means that for a short period of time you have two keys on the same device. Also, you are trusting that we aren't stealing a key - we haven't open sourced our web client code yet, but I think it's on the roadmap. Our chrome app, on the other hand, is open sourced already so you could use it instead.
If you want to be slightly more secure, you can create your backup key with an offline device such as a Mycelium Entropy. I wrote up a guide for how to do so here: 
If you want to be the most secure, you'd use our API or SDK to create both of your keys on your machine and then send the XPUBs to us. An example for doing to is here:

I think what you're really asking is: "will the risks of operating a hot wallet to provide liquidity on the Lightning Network be outweighed by the revenue that this activity generates?"
There are a ton of factors that will go into this equation, so I don't think it's a simple yes or no answer. If suspect that as Lightning matures, best practices will be emerge around how to manage the risks involved in operating as a liquidity provider.
If you're hoping for a mathematical proof, I think you're going to be disappointed. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 13:40:54
Older transactions don't get priority. In order to set an appropriate fee, you'll need to use a fee estimation tool. Bitcoin Core has one, as do many APIs for Bitcoin services.

Not exactly, as there are surely plenty of transactions paying a lower fee rate than yours. You just have to wait until the higher fee rate transactions get confirmed. Problem is, there may be more people creating new transactions at a higher fee rate who keep "jumping ahead" of you in priority. I'd be surprised if it doesn't get confirmed in the next 12 hours.

If you use a wallet that doesn't support SegWit, it's not possible for you to create a SegWit compatible address to receive funds. Now, someone could spend SegWit inputs and send them to your standard P2PKH or P2SH address. I'd assume that the wallet would display it like any other transaction.

It's my understanding that the 20th percentile was chosen because it means that there is an 80% agreement for that block size. This makes sense, but I think it can be improved. It seems to me that if the recent set of votes is going to **increase** the block size limit, then 80% of hashing power should agree to a block size of that size or higher. On the other hand, if the recent set of votes is going to **decrease** the block size limit, shouldn't 80% of hashing power be in agreement to a block size limit of that size or lower? According to the current description, it sounds like a mere 20% need to be in agreement to decrease the block size, which doesn't sound like consensus to me.

@_date: 2016-10-20 15:11:38
Technically speaking, the fee is the difference in value between the inputs and outputs, so you just take your "change" output and subtract value from it to increase the fee by the same amount. Looking at BitcoinJS I don't see an easy way to tell it to set a fee or fee rate; you might want to investigate other software that makes it easier. FYI, if you use BitGo then we automatically determine the optimal fee rate without you needing to specify anything.

It sounds like you're using Bitcoin Core. IIRC, it didn't have HD functionality until the most recent release, so you should make sure that you are actually using an HD wallet. Otherwise, it's just generating random addresses nondeterministically and you need to back up the wallet at least every 100 transactions that you send/receive. 
I haven't tried out Core's HD functionality yet, though theoretically you could manually tell the wallet to generate more addresses until it finds the rest of your coins. Your success may vary from wallet to wallet.

To date, privacy centric altcoins use various means of obfuscation to make it difficult to track transactions. But "difficult" doesn't equate to "impossible" if you adversary has sufficient resources. Zerocash uses zero knowledge proofs to provide uncrackable anonymity. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 00:42:45
Yes and no. Checking a block's header for valid proof of work is a constant time operation that does not become slower as more transactions are added to a block. Checking the block itself is a linearly scaling operation because Bitcoin Core does iterate over the transactions and verifies them individually (though it does so in parallel as opposed to serially, meaning that CPUs with more cores can verify more txs simultaneously.) You can [see the block validation code here](
@_date: 2016-10-21 14:38:03
A few ways I can see that happening:
1) If a service is dumb enough to run their bitcoin node(s) on the same IP address as their public facing web servers. 
2) If you run a listening service that connects to every node and can figure out where new transactions are originating + the service accepts inbound connections on their node.
Basically it depends upon the service's back end architecture, which you'd have to somehow figure out without breaking into their network.
@_date: 2015-11-22 23:36:18
It depends upon what you mean by "deal with malleability." There isn't a wallet in existence that can create chains of unconfirmed transactions and guarantee that they won't be invalidated by a malleated parent transaction being confirmed.

You should really only create new addresses as you use them for an HD wallet. Otherwise you may unintentially skip using too many addresses which will cause the wallet to not regenerate them if you recover it from the seed. This is due to how wallets initialize themselves by "looking ahead" a certain number of addresses (usually only a handful) to see which ones have been used, and once it hits a gap of unused addresses it stops generating more.

My point is that Bitcoin is a global protocol while laws vary from region to region. In order to "eject all the criminality" you'll need to define and propose rules that would prevent what you consider to be criminal actions from occurring on the network AND you'll need to gain consensus from the major players (devs, miners, node operators) to adopt them. Good luck.

Your series appears to be predicated upon the claim that "Purely voluntary transaction fees will never form a sustainable foundation for network security."
In part 1 of your series, you state:










My main issue with your claims is that you state them as if they are backed by math and economics but you never provide any numbers or equations. You also seem to be making a large assumption about the cost of miners including transactions - the cost to include a transaction at time of writing is negligible relative to the cost of electricity for hashing.
You also make some references to 'network security' by which I assume you mean the global hashrate. I'd note that Bitcoin will continue to function just fine even if the hashrate declined as a result of miners being priced out of the market. Also, ASIC technology continues to advance and the cost per gigahash of operating ASICs continues to decline.

That's a very expensive attack and assumes the attacker will be able to propagate said block through the network, which will be tough to do if a lot of nodes have upgraded.

Blocks are completely maxed out now:

You paid a 0.0001 BTC transaction fee which was the default for many wallets for several years. However, you need to be using dynamic transaction fees in order to keep up with the fee market.

Nearly 10% of reachable nodes run on Comcast, so I doubt it's a problem.

It's not clear what, if any, throttling ability this will have, though you might be able to configure your router to throttle the machine's connection. Switching nodes on and off constantly isn't recommended because it prevents them from becoming well connected.

You clearly don't know what you're talking about - you've fallen for the misinterpretation of BitGo's patent application that was perpetrated by Reddit trolls.

The ability for the Bitcoin network to transfer higher volumes of value doesn't make it more useful to me personally; it's more of a macro utility delta.

Community self-moderation is a critical aspect of Reddit - if you believe that the market works, then high quality content will rise to the top while low quality content such as trolling will fall to the bottom.
Perhaps it's because the mods desire to "make a safe and pleasant place" - free markets can be chaotic and unpleasant. But their goal is not safety, it is progress.

Blocks are full and there's a large backlog of transactions waiting to be confirmed.

Last I heard, when autopruning becomes available, the nodes that enable it won't be "full nodes" because they won't advertise their address, thus peers won't connect to them.

I think that we both agree that hash power is relative, and we agree that the variables that influence mining result in miners competing to the point that they operate on the brink of profitability.

Diagnosing network issues can be tricky. Did you try setting up alerting on Bitnodes so that you get emailed when your connection status changes?

I think it's too much effort for the average person. Until recently there wasn't even a comprehensive guide for running a node. [My guide]( was one of the top google results but it wasn't in depth. Now we have [this guide]( which is much better.
Also, for the home user it's probably asking too much for them to configure QoS rules so that their video streaming / other day-to-day operations aren't negatively impacted by the node's bandwidth usage. Note that [the request]( for Bitcoin Core to have a bandwidth throttling option has been open since 2011.

There's no specific part of the protocol for third party watchers, but the way that it's designed makes it quite simple. The wallet user will simply submit their signed "breach remedy transaction" (if I have that terminology correct) to the watcher, who can then only broadcast it in case of a breach and has no way to steal funds with only that data.

XT development appears to prefer deploying working solutions quickly and then iterating upon them rather than waiting for perfection; adding fee based eviction logic is on the roadmap. 
I don't buy the claim that this **creates** a cheap bandwidth attack. If someone wants to bandwidth attack a node, they can simply request a huge number of historical blocks from it in a never ending loop. Bandwidth on the Bitcoin network doesn't "get paid for" so this claim makes no sense to me.
Expecting for node operators to manually reconfigure their nodes is not a solution by any means; this should be clear simply from looking at the lag that it takes many operators to upgrade their nodes.
If a mempool change like this breaks the relay network by causing mempools to diverge, how is that **any different** from the current situation where mempools are not guaranteed to be in sync across the network?

Blocks are full and there's a large backlog of transactions waiting to be confirmed.

Your transaction will get confirmed eventually.

Bandwidth is only about 5 - 10 KB/S downstream and 10 - 50 KB/S upstream depending upon how many peers your node has. FYI I don't recommend running the node unless you're able to keep it online constantly. If your laptop is disconnecting and reconnecting to the network every few hours, you'll never become very well connected and thus the amount of data relaying that you contribute to the network will be minimal.

If we were talking about running a full node, your analogy would be appropriate. However, running a software client is a far cry from running a software server in terms of complexity.

I'm not assuming a billion users today - that's just the upper end to match some claims that have been made recently. I provided calculations that show how the cost of node operation increases from 1 tx/s all the way up to 10,000 tx/s.
These formulas involve many variables and we could argue about any given assumption ad infinitum. If you have any thoughts on how to model node growth, I'm all ears. Note that I did perform a calculation that assumed over 10X node increase. 
Storing data in memory would be even more expensive than using huge RAID arrays of spinning disks. 
More nodes means that the load from SPV clients gets distributed across more machines, lowering their cost of operation. 
The comparisons to VISA and a billion users are directly in response to claims made by others about SPV scalability, not from any assumptions of user growth on my part.
And yes, over time hardware prices will drop. Though to my knowledge disk I/O doesn't follow Moore's law.

The only way to get a high number of incoming connections is to run a node that is constantly connected to the Internet; if your connection is spotty then your incoming connections will constantly be getting dropped.

Not sure why you'd want to do this; if you have a local copy of the blockchain that you've already verified and want to start a new node on another machine you own, you can just copy the blocks directly and skip the reverification process.

That is: some people run nodes out of idealism but others do so out of self interest.
@_date: 2015-10-18 15:40:52
I find the node count to be important for a few reasons:
* serving SPV clients (need enough nodes that they have unused connections available) 
* helping new nodes to catch up to the tip of the blockchain by serving requests for historical blocks
* diversity of installations in different legal jurisdictions in order to keep the network censorship resistant 
@_date: 2015-02-10 17:35:13
It sounds like you're talking about having a whitelist of trusted nodes, which could work, but I'm talking about running nodes as a part of a trustless network. Which means that the more resources that are required for an attacker to spool up enough nodes to comprise a significant portion of the network, the higher the likelihood that your node will end up connecting to at least a few honest nodes as opposed to only sybil nodes.
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:22:28

It's a direct response to claims that existing SPV technology can support huge blocks without any modification.

HDDs are much cheaper both in terms of storage per dollar and throughput per dollar.
The assumptions around hardware cost are noted - it's not really possible to predict the future hardware costs or future adoption rates. At some point you must make some assumptions in the calculations.

Pieter basically went in depth regarding the changes listed at 
* Headers first synchronization - faster and more robust initial sync; cuts initial sync time down from several days to ~6 hours
* Dynamic transaction fee calculation - fees no longer hardcoded, scales with demand by listening to realtime fees on network.
* Consensus library - this is important for developers who want to write clients that are compatible with the protocol without having to reimplement all of the consensus logic, because a bug in a reimplementation could break that implementation.
* More script opcodes considered standard - this allows more flexibility for programmable money / contracts
* Improved security - libsecp256k1, non-deterministic signatures are now prohibited

They can, but not if they're performing high throughput operations on blockchain data. If you need to query for blockchain data in any way other than direct lookup via the hash of a block or transaction, you need an API of some sort that accesses an indexed blockchain database. You can either:
 
A) run your own indexing service locally 
B) make calls to a web-based API
If you need high performance, you have to go with option A. If you need to trust that the data provided by the indexer is valid and hasn't been tampered with, you have to go with option A. If neither of those attributes are needed for your software, you can go with option B.

Having nodes throttle connections is no different than people running nodes on low bandwidth connections. Just like the Internet itself, unusable nodes should be routed around.

@_date: 2015-02-25 21:36:31
Indeed, there are also trade-offs between usability and flexibility. They average user probably doesn't care, they just want the wallet to work and send the target value to the target address in a way that gets confirmed quickly by miners.

To be clear, that particular wallet recovery tool is for users that hold their own backup key. If you create a wallet where the backup key is held by a key recovery service, you won't have enough data for that recovery tool to work.

Once ChangeTip receives your deposit, I doubt that they keep it at that deposit address. It's unlikely that you're going to be able to associate a single address on the blockchain with your ChangeTip account.

Looks like you still have the first UTXO I sent you - you should be able to spend it just fine.

It looks like this is CPU-only. In case anyone is interested, I wrote a how-to guide a while ago for generating vanity addresses with an AMD GPU on Ubuntu:

Default connection config. Highly connected nodes can serve a lot of historical block data to peers that are doing their initial sync. Ah, running different forks is fine.

It can be confusing when you start discussing points where morality and laws can come into conflict. The actions of a law enforcer are essentially "might makes right" which in the real world holds a lot of weight, but in the philosophical world of morality it does not.
In ancapistan you would not have an enforcer come by to take away your freedom because of consensus of other people - you would have an enforcer come take away your freedom because you failed to uphold the terms of a contract to which you voluntarily committed.

People with your perspective were making the same arguments years ago about publicly stating ownership of tens of thousands of BTC when a bitcoin traded for under a dollar.

So long as it is propagating valid data, it is helping. If the pseudonode wanted to be more malevolent then it would throttle its sending of data to a trickle, just above the threshold that would cause the other nodes to disconnect from it. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 22:45:46
To be fair, setting up and maintaining a full node that makes a positive contribution to the network takes at least a minimum amount of system &amp; network administration skills, which puts it outside the reach of even the average Bitcoin user. Also, the process hasn't been documented very well until recently: 
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:53:09
Updating to a new version will dramatically improve the syncing speed. As others noted, make a backup of the wallet.dat file first.

Indeed - there's plenty of room for improvement.

That's a complex issue, I've written a few posts relating to it.
At Casa we have developed a solution that gets rid of the need for storing seeds. Other than that, I'd prefer to use a shamir's secret sharing scheme to geographically distribute key shards.

A maintainer with commit access doesn't necessarily have the github admin privileges to remove commit access from another maintainer, so it's hard to say. As another person commented, the nuclear option if the repository is compromised would be to port the code to a new repository.

Ah yes, the old "you can always leave" argument.

This is true for the average user, however it is not true for any entity that needs to have a local copy of the blockchain that they have verified themself and thus can trust.

The risks are higher because the rewards are higher. You can't mug someone and take possession of their football stadium or their equity in a company - traditionally wealthy people keep most of their wealth in highly illiquid assets.

If you're not actually using the node to protect and transact value, there's not much point.

In general I'd say that it's not really appropriate to publicly shame a company on Reddit unless you have already spoken to them privately and the outcome was unsatisfactory. I can tell you from experience that having a mob of angry redditors does not help known issues get fixed any faster.

Yes. Then they try to come to a consensus about morality and create laws to force morality upon the populace. However, this is an imperfect system. Not everything that is moral is legal and not everything that is legal is moral. When it comes to morality, do not appeal to authority - look within yourself.

I don't recall anyone claiming that there would be no ideology involved. Rather, the difference is that any politics does not occur behind closed doors among a small group of people. With Bitcoin such discussions happen in the open and no one can force anyone else to agree to rules against their wishes.

My thoughts on privacy 
As for protecting against wrench attacks, the only solution is to geographically disperse your private keys. That's what we've built at

The only foolproof solution is to distribute your keys far and wide, eliminating any single points of failure. That's what we have kept in mind while building Casa Keymaster: 
But yes, with sovereignty comes responsibility. Security should be built out of multilayered defenses; if you live in a jurisdiction that allows weapons then I'd recommended buying and training with them. Emphasis on the training.

That's not how it works. Full nodes only matter with regard to consensus if you're using them to secure and transact value.

Indeed, in order for Bitcoin to support mainstream usage it will need to support far more on-chain transactions.

To be clear, the value of a coin is not based upon the cost of mining - the cost of mining automatically adjusts to retarget the value of a coin.

I read the transcripts on Wired and my impression is that Ulbricht only wanted to hit the users who were blackmailing him (and essentially threatening to expose all SR users to govt initiated violence) 
It then sounds like he wanted to recover stolen user funds from several SR scammers but NOT kill the scammers. However, the govt agent who was posing as a hitman kept insisting that the only option was to kill everyone involved.

I wasn't referring to just the number of nodes, but to the number of people who voiced their support. We have seen sybil attacks before where a large number of nodes are spooled up by a single entity - it's hard to do so while also looking organic.

Because the cost of transacting on chain is inversely correlated with the cost of validating the chain. Full node operators are not particularly interested in bearing the costs when it's possible for people to use the block space more efficiently.

Yep, people will end up with a stronger security model if they set up their own node - and I highly recommend that people do so! But if folks find that too daunting then they may opt for a weaker security model in return for far greater convenience.

Hi jpnicole,
Can you explain the steps that you used and what went wrong?
In order to use the wallet recovery mechanism you need to:
    
    git clone 
    cd BitGoJS
    npm install
    cd example/
    node recoverwallet.js
Then follow the prompts of the wallet recovery tool, using the information from your wallet backup.
