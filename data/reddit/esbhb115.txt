It finally went through after almost 4 hours, but thanks for the offer

The address regenerated itself eventually and worked. Just a glitch in the system 
@_date: 2018-10-12 16:36:19
Idk that's just all it says. It looks a little short, but I haven't found a way to generate a new one. Idk anything about btc. I just buy it to spend it places where it saves money. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 16:01:32
I read it could be something like that and to use electrum but they wouldn't send either 
@_date: 2018-10-12 16:10:05
Idk what that means. I've just only ever bought coins then sent them. It doesn't start with Lowercase b though. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 16:22:49
How do I do that? The weird past is having 3 services say the same thing 
@_date: 2018-10-12 15:59:08
That helps a ton..... There's never been a problem before. Idk what it is about the wallet address but 3 different wallets wouldn't send. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 16:07:57
@_date: 2018-10-12 17:08:50
Well the address changed 3 times back to back and now it looks like they're proper addresses. Guess it was a little glitch
@_date: 2018-10-12 16:43:07
Fuck. That means I'll just deal with the loop around until the tell me I'm shit outta lucky 
@_date: 2015-07-12 01:30:24
I don't know what that is or at least what you're referring to. Sorry I'm knew with this.
@_date: 2015-07-12 16:26:08
will this return the unsent bitcoins back to my wallet? I only had enough to make the two transactions
@_date: 2015-07-12 01:32:57
I was referring to being dropped from mempool
@_date: 2015-07-11 23:25:30
How many days/weeks is that?
@_date: 2015-07-11 22:08:26
Yeah, but "eventually" isn't any good when I need it at least by the end of the day. First time running into this. I've always done 0 transaction fees and had things done within an hour every time, even with larger transactions than this. Gah!
@_date: 2015-07-12 16:50:27
Well all the coins were returned to my wallet and I was able to send it with a higher fee, so I'm happy. Plus the BTC value shot up overnight, so maybe them being stuck was a good thing haha
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:39:09
It's ok, I did -zapwallettxes, resent them, and it went through in about 30 minutes lol
@_date: 2015-07-12 16:40:10
YES! It worked lol. What's even better is BTC shot up by $20 overnight
@_date: 2015-07-11 23:17:13
Can you explain that for someone who's stupid or send me a guide, because I have a stuck transaction due to low fee too
@_date: 2015-07-12 01:32:18
is this a console command?
@_date: 2015-07-11 23:15:19
lol no, i just went through the motions and bitcoin-core had it already set like that 
@_date: 2015-07-12 16:18:42
ohh when i saw tx, i immediately thought "text". I'm using bitcoin-core. I've got the transaction ID, how can I use it?
@_date: 2016-07-27 21:16:36
God I feel like an idiot lol. Definitely meant to put coinbase.com
