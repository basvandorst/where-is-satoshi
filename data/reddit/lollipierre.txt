Following your comment, we've decided to change our price to .002 BTC, - at this rate we'll need a significant amount of users to pay for our costs, so I hope this will work!

Thanks for this valuable advice - looking forward to Part II !

Hi Zook, what else would you recommend us to say? We're happy to take your feedback into account.
It seems obvious that if for some reason the exchanges crash and stop providing prices, and as such an alert is not delivered, and a user suffers financial damage, we would not want to be held liable for this. Doesn't it sound fair to you ?

Ok - regarding privacy &amp; security, maybe you haven't noticed the link right next to the "Your mobile phone number" label in the form.

Done - you should have received a confirmation SMS by now.

Hi DidHeJust,
Bitcoin Ticker is a push app which means you need 7/7 24/24 3G connectivity. We send an SMS which only requires GSM connectivity, and which doesn't get buried into the flow of other notifications like Facebook etc.
The other difference is that Bitcoin Ticker doesn't use the streaming api (otherwise your iPhone battery wouldn't last very long), which means it's not very much real-time.
BitcoinMonk charges money because a reliable server and SMS setup actually costs money. It wouldn't be a great sign if you actually provided this for free...
I hope this answers your question?
