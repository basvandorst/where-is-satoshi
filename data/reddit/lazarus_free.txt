LN is encrypted in layers like TOR so basically a node only knows one hop information but does not know the original sender or receiver of the transaction, how many hops there are, etc.
My sense is that you will be able to easily hide your Bitcoins using Lightning.
For instance if all transactions are tracked until your wallet (say you bought Bitcoins from an exchange using your identity) you then create a separate wallet, open a Lightning channel with the old and new one and transfer the funds in random quantities. You close the channel. Now the Bitcoins you have in the new wallet are not possible to trace back to you.
That is my understanding until now, but it could be that there is still a way to trace them when you close the channel and it executes on the blockchain. Anybody knows?
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:41:59

Wait does this mean we can buy BTC with fiat anonymously?
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:50:31
In case Lightning does not get adopted we can always increase the block size. If we increase the block size and it could have been avoided it will be really difficult to go back. Since the decisions we take now will decide the way Bitcoin goes on for many years to come it makes much more sense to first try all the optimisations and 2nd layer solutions: Lightning, Schnorr, Segwit... And then go the blocksize increase way if none of those worked.
The block size can not increase forever so to me it would only be a temporary patch. If second layer solutions don't work we have a problem, because they are the only way of keeping Bitcoin decentralised and at the same tame being able to handle as many transactions per second as Visa.
Antonopoulos explains in one of his videos ( how you would need petabyte blocks to accommodate something close to the world economy for constant payments (and you would need the ability to transmit petabyte blocks in 10 minutes to most of the nodes so a relatively equivalent bandwith).
Once we understand that the other scaling solutions are not a solution long term we can zoom out and see that the best approach is the one we are following in BTC. We first try the solutions that if they work can provide a long term full scale solution. If that does not work we will then go the sub-optimal way increasing the block size until it gets ridiculous and can no longer sustain a decentralised network or the Bitcoin architecture.
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:35:39
If everyone uses Lightning regularly it just becomes nearly impossible to track bitcoin transactions
@_date: 2019-07-19 11:43:30

What if Central banks screw up so bad that all assets are overvalued like now? Then if you decide you don't want to invest your money on overvalued assets your only chance is to hold cash and you see what happens. There needs to be an alternative (Bitcoin) that holds value when there are no investment opportunities that suit your risk appetite.

I think Bitcoin will settle down for a while around 12k-14k which is good for the market to take a breath. Then when Lightning starts to kick off and Segwit is adopted by major exchanges we may see a huge rally

In my bank right now I have the current account for normal expenses and linked to my credit and debit cards and then I have the savings account.
Bitcoin will work in the same manner. Your savings will be in a cold/hardware wallet and then you will make periodic transfers (every 1 month or every 3 months) to the hot wallet (Lightning). So for $20 every 3 months or whatever (subject to improvement when scaling on-chain) you can do as many instant transactions as you please.
If instead of 400 transactions people do 2 onchain means every bit we save on chain with optimisations/blocksize increase gets multiplied x400
That's scaling and not the blocksize increase bringing a lot of centralisation for 2x more transactions.
At some point Bitcoin will increase the blocksize, but for a reason and with a multiplier effect, not just because is the easy solution.

@_date: 2018-01-02 21:00:33
It is better as it fixes some problems like transaction  malleability thus allowing 2nd layer scaling solutions like Lightning to work better. It also optimises the space transactions need in a block allowing more transactions per block so lower fees and providing a relief to the scaling constraints Bitcoin is facing.
It is not being implemented faster because it has just been out for 3 months and it just takes time for implementation and adoption.
@_date: 2019-07-11 11:53:55

@_date: 2019-07-18 09:16:00
Well Schnorr signatures + Merkel trees + Multisig can save 25% space in the blockchain.
I know that it is unlikely that Bitcoin can go on forever with the current block size. However I agree with the Core roadmap of exhausting all possible ways of improving efficiency in the block before actually increasing the size.

Private companies can be legally prosecuted and censored, not Bitcoin. You should be worried about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-23 09:39:27
It's different but I would say LN has greater privacy. It is off chain and each node only knows one hop so it is impossible to tell if a payment you route is from the node that sent it to you and if the next node you send it to is the receiver.
When you close the channel it is almost impossible to identify where the funds went. You could do some analysis to try to match quantities or see some correlations but is very unlikely that you find anything.
Coinjoin is great for privacy onchain and I use both. If you are paranoid, technically in Coinjoin somebody with infinite resources could just put lots of participants in the Coinjoin so that it is 99 of him and 1 of you. But very unlikely.
Problem with Coinjoin is that somebody can tell you took money from an exchange and sent it to Coinjoin so "what do you have to hide?"
Instead, if you use LN you can always argue is because of speed and cheap fees. It's good that LN has pricavy as default. I wish some day Layer 1 also does.
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:52:00
There is no such thing as bad publicity
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:41:18
The companies that haven't upgraded won't be able to compete long term because the ones who have can offer lower fees.
@_date: 2019-07-23 12:20:12
Well with Lightning millions can be anonymised. On the base layer we'll see. Maybe we'll end up with cheap and convenient Coinjoins in base layer and privacy in Lightning. A semi-anonymous base layer and a completely private second layer seems possible.
@_date: 2019-07-02 08:20:11

A good one is to use VPN. Have mine always connected and I don't need to remember to do it through Tor.
I use ExpressVPN and I think has a good track record of providing great anonimity.
Use also Tor, just in case, I am not saying the opposite. But for the average user, VPN is already a great increase in privacy.
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:24:24
He's probably running out of ammo.
@_date: 2019-07-18 09:44:42
Not with the Lightning network and sidechains. 
But yes by improving the efficiency of the block you won't end up with 1000 tx per second on chain. The problem is that to get to this level you need 1Gb blocks at minimum which means a lot of centralisation (and currently wouldn't be even feasible because of block transmission and syncronisation.
@_date: 2019-07-11 08:35:21
You are completely right OP. And also the main trick they use is to exclude housing costs from the basket of goods used to calculate inflation. That way they can justify their expansionary monetary policies because they say "there is no inflation" but housing costs are soaring because of cheap credit and QE.
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:54:09
Also block size increases are very difficult or almost impossible to reverse, so makes sense to first go for the optimisation solutions.
@_date: 2019-07-22 12:49:50
Can't we just fill it up with spam transactions and show that is not feasible?
@_date: 2019-07-30 17:25:14
As I said it is not perfect, Tor is better. But VPN is a great improvement and ExpressVPN and companies like that, that have a bit of history, are much more trustable than your ISP.
For instance ExpressVPN is located on British Virgin Islands, where there is no requirement to keep logs and they'll only respond to a judicial order won in a court there. And once they have responded, in a few major cases, the answer was that there are no logs that could keep track of the activity.
Turkey raided their servers for a high-stakes spionage case but they could find nothing.
Yes you need to trust them. Tor is still stronger. But I'd say is a great leap forward for the average user.
If I am Julian Assange and have the CIA after me maybe VPN is not enough. But I personally have a VPN in case I say something stupid on Twitter and Government or somebody want to chase me, probably too much trouble to find me if I use VPN.

Well Lightning network has strong privacy so anything that enhances it like watchtowers, channel factories, Eltoo... Makes Bitcoin more private.
Onchain improvements like Schnorr, Taproot, Multisig or Dandelion also make Bitcoin more private.
It is not "private or not" there are simply improvements that make privacy more feasible and convenient and that make us a step closer to true privacy.

In Europe pension systems in Spain, France and Italy are quite unsustainable. Sure you don't have university debt but you keep paying for it all your life via ridiculously high taxes.
Why do we think Europe has stagnated? Because it fosters a system where everyone thinks they can live off the government, where they want their neighbour to pay taxes and they want to receive. A system that goes against meritocracy, the more productive you are the more they take from you, marginal taxes even reach 50%.

I am of the opinion that Bitcoin is an asset like a stock from a startup. In a startup you don't even know the price because is not listed, but would look like it.
To me, Bitcoin is a binary outcome: it either succeeds and becomes quite mainstream or it fails for some reason.
So I just invest on it like I would in the starts of Microsoft, when it was just a start-up. And I just hodl.

Transfer your Bitcoins to the Lightning wallet just "blocks" them. Then you can do 15 transactions in a minute with your friend if you are playing poker for example.

We don't know about Lightning which is the solution that fixes it forever, but with just more Segwit adoption the capacity of a block could increase potentially to 4x which would buy us years until the Lightning network gets deployed. Schnorr signatures could provide extra 25% capacity

Gold is impractical to trade physically. If you don't trade it phisically you just go through the regular financial system where all operations are controlled and subject to capital tax gains for instance, since you first need to change to dollars to do the operation.
Bitcoin is the currency in itself, you can do a transaction without using regular currencies and opt out of the system. Gold can do that but only in tje physical form, and it is not very practical. Many businesses accept Bitcoin. Could I go there and pay with a gold coin? Probably not. Can I link a credit card to my gold deposit via some services that offer this possibility? I probably can, but would be the same as using my credit card.

I mean an increase in Segwit until 30% would already keep the mempool empty, and if it is true that Coinbase will implement it in 2018 we may get 50-60% soon which can keep the mempool empty for quite a long time. Once Lightning can operate market forces will do the rest, people will want the almost zero fee transactions.

The lightning network is encrypted with Tor like routing, no way to know where a transaction came from, if it is the latest jump or the first one, etc. 
Also anyone can open a node just like in Bitcoin. It is impossible to regulate.

It is not our first rodeo guys, they just did this pump n dump scheme when S2X was dumped. BTC will prevail again
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:37:23
What does not add up in the whole story is: why would Bcash block Segwit if the purpose is just to have larger blocks? And here is where everything gets smelly as Segwit allows for second layer solutions (which miners don't like) and makes Asicboost worthless (which a single miner does not like). Other than that there is no explanation as to why block Segwit

Dude just fees for 1 transaction, what $5 or 10?

2-3% inflation is what they tell you. Inflation is not the consumer price index only, look at prices of houses or assets. Maybe deflationary or maybe a currency with a fixed inflation rate, anything would be better than fiat. 
Bitcoin does not have to be better than Visa, just equal at most would be fine and at some point it will be possible. It needs to be an alternative to allow people to escape the confiscation via monetary policy. Will then governments find other ways to tax? Probably, but will be far less popular and people will actually realise of the theft.
I think you have very good points but you need to understand that we are at the beginning of a new technology that one thing has fot sure: it can not be de-invented. We are at the Internet at its beginnings, who could think how it could change and shape the world? At the beginning the Internet also had escalability problems, was extremely slow, you couldn't purchase anything... We don't know how Bitcoin is going to turn out in 20 years. I have a lot of faith in it but as you say there are many points still to be covered.
But if we can continue to improve it and get to a point where there is a way to do instant transactions, has worldwide escalability and is accepted widely, it can certainly become an alternative asset on which to store value and at the same time transact.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:52:19
You can build a reliable instant payments network on a decentralised ledger and use the decentralised ledger to store value safely.
If you go the way of block increases you centralise too much that ledger so then only thing you can have is a payments network but you can't use it as a store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:55:14
Why some of the exchanges have it ready but not deployed?
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:26:56
I know what he means but it is a bad comparison because "occupy wall street" was a leftist movement. 
Which maybe spoke some truths but had as final objective to bring propositions forward that would reduce individual freedom.
Bitcoin is the opposite, wants to avoid the control that Wall Street has on our freedom. Most leftists don't like Bitcoin much.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:47:19
This js because there is a lot of people who is into Bitcoin but has never traded or followed stocks or other investments and they overreact because they don't understand volatility or how volatile Bitcoin is
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:02:08
People still using gold as a refuge asset. The difference is that gold is not practical to make payments. Paying in phisical gold is not feasible and doing it via some services that let you store gold and pay means basically paying with a credit card all over again and means that those institutions are controlled and regulated whith KYC bullshit
Bitcoin is different. Whith Bitcoin you can hold an asset for which we know its monetary policy and transfer it to the other side of the world in seconds. And you don't need intermediaries.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:50:11
Well you are just talking about the current situation as it stands now. There is a long way to go. I am talking about a near future where we have Lightning network and other options that make Bitcoin more practical and the acceptance is higher. I am not saying Bitcoin is better than gold as it stands now. I am saying it has the chance to become so.

I think people who think of holding for life don't mean never spending BTC but imagine a world with Lightning where with a little effort you can pay for anything in Bitcoin from flights to cars or coffees.
When I mean I will be holding I mean I am not converting back to fiat, but at some point I want to start spending some of my BTC.

Whoever claimed that Futures would increase volatility did not understand what he was talking about.
The more trading and volume Bitcoin has, the less volatility. The possibility of shorting it also decreases volatility.
Futures bring more investors and less volatility, have been a big plus for Bitcoin.

Well in currencies everything is about "brand" which is effectively the nerwork effect.
But Bitcoin has also the most secure network with the highest hash rate.
Also the most interesting technologies are coming to Bitcoin. Once Lightning gets deployed 90% of currencies will be worthless. Bcash for sure.
@_date: 2019-07-11 08:38:37
By the way the definition of inflation by Austrian economists is the issue of money. And the quantity of money issued for most currencies normally is like 6-7% per year.
They then created this definition of inflation as in the increase in the price of goods (excluding the ones they don't want to include like housing costs) and then they built a whole tale of paranoia around deflation. Deflation is bad when it signals a crisis and because of the crisis not because of the deflation itself. Deflation that comes because of the increase in productivity is good!
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:34:39
That was before, now all my family and friends have heard about Bitcoin and know it is valuable. But had I given them Bitcoin a year ago probably the same would have happened.

Because of government restrictions you can't convert your bolivars to dollars at the quantity you want. The government controls all the dollar flows from oil and if you get it at the black market you currently pay 100.000 bolivars per dollar.
With Bitcoin you get the anonymity and Government can't control it. Let´s not be delusional the dollar is still most of people's choice, but Bitcoin provides an escape as well. And the transactions can not be traced that easily.
@_date: 2019-07-23 11:35:08
Trezor or Ledger are the safest options.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:25:54
How can they know you spent them though? I mean if you exchange them there is a recorded transaction in a regulated exchange. But if you just go somewhere and buy a t-shirt with Bitcoin nobody knows your identity.

No, you don't have to open a channel with everyone you want to deal with. You have a channel opemed with a node and then the network finds you a route with whomever you want to connect. The channel you connect with does not necessarily have to be a central hub, but in an ideal world all channels will be interconnected in some ways, does not matter if has to do 700 hops.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:59:58
Clearly there is a FUD attack going on, check the users making those comments
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:08:41
It will butnot only because of this correlation between transactions and price. It will because it is a revolution, solves Bitcoin's main long term problem and creates the perfect currency: a currency that stores value, with transparent monetary policy, divisible, portable, and useful for payments including micropayments.
Lightning also makes Bitcoin more fungible and provides more anonimity.
So I think we are underestimating the technology if it is just a matter of "more transactions"
@_date: 2019-07-18 07:29:53
Well quicker and becoming more centralised by the day
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:20:06
But there is the network effect and all the advantages of Bitcoin itself. If that were true all the market would have switched to the cheapest coin to transact with
@_date: 2018-09-15 08:20:27
Bitcoin gives you the choice. You want to purchase it through ETF and be subject to KYC and AML laws? You are free to do it. Do you want to use it more privately? So can you.
An ETF is positive for Bitcoin because it gives it more legitimacy and liquidity. In other words you would be closer to buying your coffee in Starbucks with Bitcoin if Starbucks knows there is an ETF which means institutional investor money which means more liquidity.
People who buy futures and ETFs kind of promote the use and legitimacy of Bitcoin so then millions of users can use it for payment, storage of value or whatever whithout going 'through the system'.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:19:43
Well but then another cryptocurrency would be this store of value. What I am saying is that the technology has the power to create an asset which has better qualities to become a currency and store of value than anything we have in existance. How is it going yo tur out or if it will be Bitcoin or another one nobody can tell

@_date: 2017-12-20 01:24:05
Keep calm. We need to keep fighting our fights: get more Segwit adoption to buy time for Lightning to be deployed. Remember that the blocksize would be the equivalent to 2 to 4mb if we get enough adoption. Educate users and put pressure on companies. Don't worry about Bcash, once Lightning gets deployed it will be worthless and that will happen mid-next year
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:17:46
Everything is speculative. Bitcoin has value because the technology is useful to store value securely, it has a better design than fiat and soon it will be able to deliver micropayments. It is not speculative, it provides a vehicle for communicating value which is what currency is about.
And yes we are at historical lows and 8 year bull market. It could be that it still gives more fuel for growth or it could be a catastrophe if a recession hits.
@_date: 2018-09-21 18:39:18
Why is that?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:02:35
And then Bcash strategists will have to explain something that to date they have not been able to explain: we all get they are pro-big blocks but why where they against Segwit? 
All the FUD has been proven wrong anf ull of lies... Remember "Segwit = anyone can spend transaction" 
They will have to explain that they were blocking Segwit for the sole purpose of being able to exploit ASICboost. This is the only real reason Bcash exists. Let´s all remember how there was the New York agreement to implement Segwit and then increase the blocksize and some miners decided unilaterally to start a new coin without Segwit.
Let´s all remember how they blocked Segwit for over a year. Where would be the % support now if it weren´t for them? They are bringing solutions to the same problems they create.

@_date: 2018-09-11 07:29:11
The Lightning Network still needs to go a long way, but it is feasible in theory. If there is demand to use BTC like a currency for micropayments, instantly and with no fees, the Lightning network will keep growing. Now you have to be a little bit geek to participate, it needs time until it gets to a mainstream audience. But if there is demand then it will be very lucrative to have a node with some committed funds, and that's how it will start growing.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:37:47
Currently living in the UK, I thought most of the countries would regulate it in the same way as they do with shares for instance
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:37:19
Well Segwit 100% adoption would mean blocks from 3-4MB which short and medium term would be more than enough
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:57:15

Well if you are going to own it for a few years choose it for its usability, security and really the device that you like the most. It would be a mistake to choose it for its price or delivery time because chances are once you own it you will not remember how much you paid or how long did it take.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:28:27
Remembers me of how a friend was talking to a bunch of us thinking nobody knew anything about crypto (I do), he was describing "I spent X in ETH when was trading at 15 so I sold it at the beginning of the year and bought BTC and now I have a fair amount of money"
Obviously he did not want to reveal the quantity and he saw it was a mistake when my eyes went wide open as I mentally calculated he approximately made $800k. He saw it, asked me if I had been following cryptos and asked me politely not to say the amount.
Just be careful guys, you are better of if nobody knows you have money. If people know you have a lot of money you will find soon enough desperate friends asking you for money and getting mad if you deny them.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:17:05

I don't get why Bitcoin dominance increases if the price of Bitcoin or the crypto market cap decreases and vice-versa.
Is it because of a flight to safety?
Is it because of retarded ways to invest like "I will put 10% in each of the 10 main coins"?
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:16:35
Keep it up, we need to increase adoption
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:06:54
Good news, fast progress!
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:35:51
We have Segwit and we need to push for adoption. 50% adoption or close would buy us more than 1 year.
Lightning is the long term solution. Segwit is the short term one. Educate people, convince companies, use it yourself and be patient. BTC is not doing it the fast way but the right way. Escalate optimising the block size and with two layer solutions is the best long term shot. In the meantime we have Segwit, we just need to get more adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:14:23
If you don't exchange Bitcoin for fiat but spend your Bitcoin do you need to pay capital gains tax?
@_date: 2018-09-10 12:24:16
The problem is that you are treating Bitcoin like a stock from a well established company. It is not, it is mostly like investing in a start-up with a binary outcome, you can be right or not about it.
So focus on the technology developments and hold if you think it is going to be successful. Don't look at the price. If you are right does not matter if you bought at 2,000 at 6,000 or at 10,000.
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:08:26
Ok but as long as they are cheaper, people will keep switching and the word spreading. What I mean is that I would be actually worried if there weren't any incentives to switch. Since there are, I think that eventually all the market will tend to use Segwit addresses.
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:58:58
You could hedge it with futures
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:44:48
Well but they do so because they can, is a decentrised environment and everyone is free to do what they please. Everyone knows the true Bitcoin and people who get mislead into believing in Bcash will get burned
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:36:35
Ok I understand, thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:12:06
Really? Bcash is still under 10% of BTC market cap... And BTC is at only 10% Segwit adoption, just as Segwit gets adopted a bit more and fees go down Bcash loses its immediate purpose. As Lightning network goes live, it loses all its purpose.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:11:58
I own Trezor and really happy with it
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:34:20
You don't get it. Let's imagine that you want to spend $2,000 equivalent in BTC the following month because you pay all your expenses in BTC.
You have your "savings" account with $100,000 worth of BTC. You do a single transaction of $2,000 equivalent in BTC from your wallet to a Lightning wallet. That will cost you whatever fee let´s say $10. 
Then you pay all your expenses and also receive money or whatever in the Lightning wallet, so yo do thousands of transactions at almost no cost. The final balance is $300 in your Lightning wallet. Then you just want to settle it in the blockchain and send it back to your savings wallet, so you pay the closing fee.
For $20 in fees you may have done as many instant transactions as you pleased. And even better news: you didn't even have to close the channel, you can keep using it for your daily expenses and transferring BTC, but each time you fund it from a wallet you will pay the transaction fee because you pay fees in the Blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:36:56
I can't wait. Also with more Segwit adoption fees will drop nd their main propaganda disappear
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:54:23
Antonopoulos has a talk when he says the way we use cash is limited by the own limitations of cash transactions today. He said "why not earning your salary per minute? instead of once a month?" if lightning works it opens up a whole new world of possibilities.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:59:10
I think it is fairly easy: you have cold wallets with your savings that could be $100k in Bitcoin and then you have your hot wallet same as you have in your mobile phone now but in the Lightning app for everyday spending and you keep there like $2000 and you do a transaction a month when you run out (if it is your goal to spend only Bitcoin). I don't see this as a milestone considering what it achieves: solving the scalability problem by keeping Bitcoin secure and decentralised.
@_date: 2018-09-15 08:11:54
This ia why is not a good idea to create a coin with the same PoW than Bitcoin. Because of the network effect the big fish eats the small one (and in this case Bitcoin has a better development team, community is bigger, more decentralised, responsible conservative roadmap...)
It would be good for Bitcoin if Bcash keeps crashing and at some point there is a 51% attack and it is gone. It will further strengthen Bitcoin against forks.
To properly fork you change the PoW and start from scratch, or you have to be the dominant coin. Otherwise you are doomed.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:43:57
Well first you obviously need to acquire Bitcoin, but then what you do with it is not controllable by anyone
@_date: 2018-09-21 09:32:53
They are taking the comments seriously. Guys we should write more! But no bullshit, well written and good arguments.
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:11:22
Second layer solutions also mean that miners lose some importance and potentially some fees. That is why they were blocking it as well
@_date: 2018-09-07 13:30:05
They prefer to live in denial, they downvote objective truths
@_date: 2018-09-15 08:24:40
It is not because we don't know which investment is better than others. Stocks? Bonds? Real estate? No one can tell because past performance is no guarantee of future performance.
Bitcoin is like an investment in a startup: it can make you rich if is successful or make you lose most of the investment if not.
For your own good, stop seeing Bitcoin as a stock that should have a capital appreciation each year. Stop following the price in the short term. Invest on it like you would in a startup private company: you would not know how much is worth every day, but you know it has a great product which if is adopted is going to be worth a lot in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:11:18
No it is not, because the scaling is exponential and you would end up with a blocksize that would make it impossible
Antonopoulos explains: 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:51:29
It is important to keep fighting, next thing we need to do is get as much Segwit adoption as possible, to buy enough time for the Lightning Network to be deployed.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:40:32
If Segwit adoption increases Bcash will go down as will lose all purpose.
If Lightning network gets deployed game over
@_date: 2018-09-27 16:32:43

Best news in a while
@_date: 2018-09-15 12:36:28
I am wondering why the whole crypto market goes together. Big players may be doing some retarded investment. Because if there is some positive news in BTC this may be harmful to the other currencies, and there are continuously developments that set some coins apart and leave others behind. It is fucking retarded to invest in the market as a whole like I suspect the institutional players do.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:13:52
Well I think you are confusing price and market cap increase with volatility. It does not necessarily need to be volatile to continue climbing, it can do so in a steady way.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:37:02
I am in the finance industry and just in case someone is wondering 5% is A LOT.
Normally a portfolio of this kind would have 30% fixed income 50% stocks and then investments in commodities/private equity and so on. But within the 50% that is stocks there are maybe a hundred of them and includes mutual funds, etc. so 5% allocation to one single asset is a lot for a portfolio
@_date: 2018-09-22 08:40:54
Well that explains how it works to calculate so thank you. But maybe I am being a bit thick but I just don't see why normally BTC dominance increases when the market is up and decreases when is down.
@_date: 2018-09-11 06:37:14
Of course. But what I mean is that it is like discussing if you bought Amazon at $1.3 or $1.5. The important part is that it was successful and now worth $1,940.
The difference will not come from where you buy but from whether you are right about the technology long term.
I bought most of my Bitcoin when it was at $2,000. But I don't get bothered nor excited if it is at $6,000 or $10,000.  I get excited when there are new developments in privacy and scaling instead.
@_date: 2018-09-21 14:50:12
Question: is Bcash still having this bug then?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:20:29
Yes but in the end they will have to otherwise you will have the possibility of transacting with zero fees vs Coinbase and echanges paying high fees. It will be either adapting or dying. 
But yeah it is a good point, I can see why they are reluctant. And it makes sense that they were supporting 2x and all this thing.
@_date: 2018-09-10 21:50:13
But you don't need to close the channel for every transaction. You basically open one channel and can use only this one forever if you wanted, until you want to settle tje balance in the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:29:42
This is just too good to be true. Normally there is a catch in those news. If really you will be able to pay any Microsoft product or Starbucks in Bitcoin this is so huge Bitcoim should have doubled in price when this news went live.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:14:11
I don´t think is going to be more complicated than using Bitcoin. Yes it may take some time but if the reward is huge: no fees at all, people start moving their asses and learning how
@_date: 2018-05-15 07:34:26
They are childish, let's just ignore them.
@_date: 2018-08-04 18:04:46
It does not matter really if they convert instantly to fiat. Because what it will matter is that Bitcoin is accepted. This will give more usefulness to the coin. You would be able to sell your guitar lessons for Bitcoin and exchange that for a coffee or software services. That then those merchans instantly convert it to fiat does not matter, your Bitcoin has real use, you earned and possess Bitcoin and you don't need to exchange it for fiat but can buy goods and services with it. 
Let's put it this way: if you were able to purchase all goods and services possible in Bitcoin you could keep all your savings in it and never go back to fiat. Maybe the merchants would, but you would never have to be slowly stolen by uncontrolled inflation.
And if you can purchase more and more services more people would hold Bitcoin, which would feed pure Bitcoin economy. It is more likely that the guy you are giving guitar lessons to has Bitcoin to pay you if he can spend them also buying coffee.
This is why it is so great, it will increase demand for Bitcoin as it becomes more useful to buy things, and that will have an impact on the price.
And this also opens a wide range of opportunities. Imagine most of merchants in the US follow Starbucks and Microsoft, I could go to the US on vacation without even acquiring dollars. 
So it does not matter really if then those merchants convert it to fiat. Also if Bitcoin becomes more stable and Starbucks could buy their coffee in Bitcoin, there would be less incentive for them to exchange immediately to fiat, this opens the door to some merchants actually keeping Bitcoin.

Well because is better if we push for it now, say adoption is 70% and when there is an uptick in volume we absorb it automatically as opposed to having to deal with high fees for a period of time while we shun services that are forced to charge higher fees. But I get your point.
@_date: 2018-08-17 06:58:58
This will show that a cryptocurrency only has value if it has embedded a responsible monetary policy and is built in a decentralised manner so this cannot be changed. This petro currency is built so that it can be abused just like fiat. Just because it is called "crypto" doesn't mean anything.

If only more people had read Friedman or Hayek the world would be a better place. Austrian economists were the only ones who predicted the 2008 crisis and yet keynesianism continues to be the mainstream economics and Central Banks are praised for "taking us out of the crisis"... Seriously some times I have a hard time dealing with it and I get enraged reading mainstream media. A good friend told me the reason why keynesianism is mainstream: it advocates for intervention which gives polititians a reason to clinge to power and make the population depend on their subsidies and on them "fixing" the economy.

They used the "hard fork" word to pump the price as many investors associate it with the creation of another coin and increase in value before the date. When people realised is just a software upgrade with no creation of another coin the price corrected.

Yeah but you don't need to run it yourself. You will simply scan the QR code and Lightning will find you a route, and you will have no idea how many hops or which nodes it connected to. Hence I don't see the issue with IPs for the darknet.

The point is that there will be a chain of nodes that will make the connection possible, but the DN place accepting payments just needs to have a channel open with somebody in the Lightning network and this interaction won't reveal the final destination or who the payments are coming from.
@_date: 2018-05-10 12:03:16
If the parties have externalised the monitoring of the channel to a Watchtower and this is still online in the assumed scenario if one party tried to cheat by broadcasting a previous state of the channel the watchtower would broadcast the penalising transaction automatically. However it could be the case that one of the parties is offline enough so that there is no way the watchtower knows the latest state of the channel if all transactions have happened offline.

The only reason to block Segwit was because Asicboost is no longer working so mining cartel loses power and there is more decentralisation. Rest was FUD and has been proven wrong.
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:25:14
At some point Bitcoin will have to increase the block size. Even with Lightning, opening and closing channels at some point of adoption will be too much for the current block size and fees would be prohibitive.
The key here is "at some point" and understanding that:
1\- There is a tradeoff between increase block size and centralisation
2\- Block size cannot scale forever
If we think of a world where 1 billion people are using Bitcoin, if they do 2 two transactions a month that means 772 transactions per second, which means already more than 500mb block.
But that's 2 transactions in a month! With Lightning \+ 500mb blocks those people could just do the opening and closing transaction and use Lightning for all the rest. Even better, the size of the block could be lower as there would be no need to settle all transactions in the blockchain, eventually people could just use Lightning.
Now let's imagine what would happen to those who pretend to only scale via blocksize increase, let's say people use Bitcoin to do 5 purchases a day so 150 transactions per month. That's 57,870 transactions per second. Good fucking luck with that! To handle Visa\-like transactions \(2000 per second\) the size of the block should be 1GB already. Which means they now need 29 GB blocks. And what if instead of 1 billion we have 3 billion? We need 173.000 transactions per second. But what if people are actively trading Bitcoin and institutions as well? What if the 5 transactions per day are way more?
You can't win this game. So obviously it is easy now "let's just increase the block size". But if we don't investigate second layer solutions and only do the boring scaling solution at some point we will be trapped.

@_date: 2018-05-05 20:41:31
They tried hard manipulating the price when Bcash went over 2000. Delusional people will lose a lot of money again. BTC with Segwit only at 35% has no longer capacity problems and adoptin can still go all the way up to 100%. On top of that all of the innovation   regarding Lightning, Schnorr and best developer team is in BTC. All Bcash has is a boring idea non-scalable in the long term. This is what matters. Price can go up or down in the short term, but the best coin with the best network and developers will prevail.

A random thought came to me whatching this. Cicada and other supposedly cypherpunk organisations were quite irrelevant because lacked resources. With Bitcoin  I guess the percentage of first owners is to a great degree cypherpunks who believed in the idea. So Bitcoin not only changes the world by providing a means of private money but also some of those organisations and individuals must have a lot of money and resources now.

@_date: 2018-05-15 12:41:19
Well that's 52,560 GB per year. But I would say the problem stems from bandwith and latency instead of storage capacity. Also for Bitcoin to have real adoption and "bank the unbanked" the block would have to be potentially much bigger than 1 GB.
Everyone want cheap, reliable, fast, secure and decentralised money, but there is no easy way of doing that and to me the obvious way (increasing block size) is not scalable in the end.
@_date: 2018-05-25 19:53:45
There will be a period of more than 1 month when Bcash does the halvening first. If by then Bcash is 10% of Bitcoin in value and then halves, if no miner subsidises it it could get to 5% hashrate as compared to Bitcoin, very vulnerable.
@_date: 2018-05-18 07:42:38
Well it is just like a database and the payment is not properly settled they just transmit some data allowing credit on behalf of you. So they just need big ass servers but there is no challenge as to why they couldn't make it.

You need a channel open but not with the party you are making the payment to.
@_date: 2018-05-16 07:30:11
Lightning Network is a huge improvement to fungibility. The network is TOR-like encrypted so nodes have only one hope information. 
If you have wallet A with coins coming from an exchange with KYC so linked to you, you could create address B, open Lightning channels with both addresses (no need for the channel to be with each other necessarily) and then if you transfer the coins from A to B and close the channels, once the transaction is broadcasted in the blockchain it is not treaceable from A to B.
Huge improvement to fungibility in my opinion.
I obviously want also fungibility and anonimity at the base level, but Lightning brings a great degree of it already.
@_date: 2018-05-08 22:04:39

I think it is then when we will discover that Bitcoin is a real store of value. To counteract the crisis the central banks will restart QE or even consider "helicopter money" which is directly printing for the government to spend without any future obligation from the government. Meanwhile Bitcoin will just keep pumping, every 10 minutes, as secure as always, in the same predictable "printing" path. To me it looks like it will easily become a safe haven.

They process Bitcoin transactions but in order to have the chance to introduce their block into the blockchain and claim the reward they also need to solve a mathematical problem. The purpose of resolving it is to show commitment in terms of energy (which costs money) making it really expensive for a miner to try to cheat. For instance if a miner tried to introduce fraudulent transactions in the blockchain he would have to spend a lot of money in hardware to solve the mathematical problem and the block would be rejected by nodes so he would not be able to claim the reward. If the miners were only processing transactions nothing would stop them from trying to cheat because they would not commit a lot of money and energy as is currently the case.

I don't like the comparison, with Lightning you are exchanging Bitcoin ownership directly, not any "credit".
Still the constrain is the blockchain, it is true that Lightning leverages a lot the capacity but we still need to figure out how we will deal with so many opening/closing of channels if Bitcoin is to be used as a mainstream currency.
There is a lot of hope, but we need to be reasonable with the challenges ahead and regarding Lightning I am most worried about the base layer constraints.

Ok that's great. Since you seem to know what you are talking about let me ask you a stupid question.
My intention is to move the funds from Trezor, anonymise and move back to Trezor. By creating a new address (that Trezor does automatically when receiving it should be enough right?)
My question is what happens if you have a Trezor balance of 100 and you move your funds but calculate wrong the fees and 0.1 funds remain in the wallet in address A which is tainted with your identity. Then you move 99.9 to Wasabi and coinjoin and move back. Since Trezor generates a new address those are anonymous, but there is 0.01 that you left by mistake which is not.
Trezor then shows total amount 100 but isn't there a risk that you spend 100 and this 0.01 coming from the first address reveals your identity?
Sorry if it is a retarded question.

@_date: 2018-10-06 17:27:48
But even if he was a genius and it is good to follow his advice and principles, the whole thing about "Satoshi's vision" as if it were an act of faith does not sound appealing to me. We need to encourage critical thinking amd that everyone defends their own choices for Bitcoin based on informed decisions.
In pointing out some of the things that Satoshi did mot entirely foresee, I just pointed out that he is human and chances are he could be wrong in many ways even though he was clearly a genius. If I was a gifted genius on the field of self-driven cars, does not mean that what I foresee now in ten years will have to be followed, I would be probably wrong in many ways and someone less gifted would be able to better identify and resolve problems that arise in 10 years just because I am not even able to concieve now that those problems will exist.
@_date: 2018-10-30 08:24:14
There are many more arguments against the blocksize increase and that's not even the main one. The main problem is most likely in terms of bandwith and latency for transmission of the blocks.
That said it is node centralisation what would happen. If you need huge data farms to store the blockchain there would be fewer Bitcoin nodes and easier to shut down, even if mining was less centralised than it is now.

You can still move to other countries and spend your Bitcoin and you just need to take the seed with you, and could even be memorized.

Well as users we have the power. Keep pressuring wallets and users to use Segwit. He won't be able to mine non-segwit transactions if all transactions are Segwit.
Also if his point is that he does not mine them because they pay less fees, that's a pretty good selling point if you need to convince somebody to switch to Segwit.

Both. That's what is so great about Bitcoin. We are so used to fiat currencies that get inflated by governments that we forgot that a good currency can be useful for transactions and as a store of value. It does not need to be a bad store of value in order to be a good currency, the only reason why national currencies are a bad store of value is so politicians can spend more and them inflate the currency to pay the debt.

Ok I may do that. But a hardware wallet is much more resilient. I basically use Trezor for cold storage and I want to know my cold storaged BTC are anonymised. So I may just move all of them out from Trezor, coinjoin and then back with a new address. Then for front-end transactions use Wasabi, and the HD wallet for cold storage only.
Thank you for your help.

My message was not intended at undermining Satoshi, for whom I have a great respect, but was more towards saying that his word is not sacred and that a second tier developer right now has better information and thus probably better judgement than Satoshi did 10 years ago. So there is no point in doing things just because is Satoshi's vision but because they make sense now according to our visions and opinions with all the information we have now which Satoshi did not have.
@_date: 2018-10-31 15:58:39
Awesome! If only a great percentage of users used this and took privacy precautions the coin would be fungible because you would lose trace very soon even if you started from non-private transactions. So it is a great step forward!
@_date: 2018-10-29 19:34:13
But he is mot losing fees right now, if he includes 100% non-Segwit he is not giving up fees. If there weren't enough non-Segwit transactions to fill a block that's when he starts giving up fees right?

How do you provide liquidity? By coinjoining your coins multiple times? Or just by having them in the wallet they are providing liquidity?
@_date: 2019-11-29 13:51:40
But Lightning massively improves privacy by allowing nodes to have only 1 hop information so you are not able to tell whether the node that sent you the transaction is the originator and whether the next node you are relying it to is the receiver. Lightning transactions are almost impossible to track. That's a massive improvement of privacy. Once Taproot is implemented an almost flawless way of 'anonymising' Bitcoin will be to send it to yourself via Lightning.
@_date: 2018-10-20 10:34:57
To me there is a flaw in Bitcoin structure: I think full nodes should be somehow rewarded. I think when Bitcoin was planned the idea was that every computer would be mining so mostly nodes would also be miners. With the centralisation of mining there is now a flaw, that is nodes have to do it for free (or even losing money because it has costs). 
This could be resolved with Lightning. To run a Lightning node you need a Bitcoin node, and you do get paid for running a Lightning node.

Huge!! I was recently thinking that Bisq is way underrated as in its importance to the BTC ecosystem. It is a gate of exchange with fiat that governments cannot ban and that is difficult to detect since is peer to peer.
So Governments could ban all exchanges but we would still be able to ttade BTC between us with Bisq.

@_date: 2018-10-31 17:43:50
I will, definetely. I just have stupid questions arising now such as: you have 10BTC you coinjoin 1, the wallet creates a separate address for this one? Is there a way to track which ones have been "anonymised"?
If I want to send my Bitcoin from Trezor here, do coinjoin and back, is it enough if I create a new address with Trezor?
But I should make sure there isn't even 1 cent left right? Otherwise this traceable cent if I add the rest of the quantity back and then spend from there would give up my identity.
I have so many questions that's why I was asking for a guide, but let me first download it and go through it.
@_date: 2018-10-31 21:12:38
Yes coinjoins are early stage but seem like a huge development. And with Schnorr I understand the coinjoin transactions will be indistinguishable. This is the true advance.
@_date: 2018-10-31 16:52:05
The point is if a lot of people use coinjoin most of the transactions will have been 'coinjoined' at some point.

Well depends on how you measure inflation, for instance inflation in the price of assets is way higher than CPI.
Also when they do QE, for instance, the Fed assumes in its balance sheet an asset when it buys a bond from tje Government, which will be financed by future taxes.
The Government of Venezuela just increases the monetary mass massively without regard.
Also the value of money depends on demand vs supply. If the dollar is still the reserve currency and there is high demand it can print more without losing that much value. Obviously there is a limit to what can be printed without provoking massive inflation.
@_date: 2018-10-31 18:09:24
I think you are right and that's why it was such a great improvement in privacy.

In theory when you buy stuff for BTC you are also liable to pay capital gains taxes.
@_date: 2018-10-30 08:47:16
There will be steps in between and the block size will have to be increased. But a conservative standpoint is: let's Segwit adoption play out, let's get Schnorr signatures and all possible optimisations, then let's look at a blocksize increase. I think everyone knows at some point it will have to be increased, but not recklessly and without exploring all other options.
@_date: 2018-10-06 08:34:48
Satoshi was a very intelligent person or group of people, but he had no crystal ball to see the future and got many things wrong (for instance he did not foresee the centralisation of mining).

Yeah but problems with currencies can happen in the means of depreciation (Argentina, Russia) or by capital controls (China). It doesn't need to be the socialist hell that Venezuela has become where they seem to be poised to go back to the stone age.
But even then a Venezuelan that took good care can just leave the country with a mobile wallet, hardware wallet, or just a seed, and take his savings with him. Bitcoin is still extremely useful in those cases.

But if it does become mildly mainstream it will be the best investment ever.
It is just that people misunderstand it. Bitcoin is like investing in Venture Capital or early stage companies, it will not provide cash flows any time soon and its value is difficult to assess and volatile, but if it becomes mildly successful the returns will be astonishing.
But you don't trade or seek fast profits when investing in Venture Capital, you believe in a project and invest in it for the long term, and there is no middle ground it either is successful or it isn't and you need to bet only money you can afford to lose if it isn't.

Governments will never allow it unless they are conquered from inside by a generation of bitcoiners. They need inflationary currencies to finance the spending they use to buy votes and stay in power.
The difference is that now there is a way to opt out of this system.
A system of negative yields in even junk bonds (in Europe) and of inflated stock and house prices, where you can choose to keep money in the bank (it will be inflated), buy bonds (with negative yield) or buy stocks (which are in a bubble). You are fucked in any way.
Bitcoin is risky, I am not saying the opposite, but it's like taking the ball and saying 'I'm not playing your game anymore'.

And it is not even a threat to their printing pyramid scheme. I mean with all its flaws and being regulated it would still pose a challenge if FB decided to have a fixed monetary policy of say 2% tokens per year.

That's exactly my thoughts. Mainstream investors fail to understand the potential of Lightning. Not only for payments and scalability but for me there is one feature that is being overlooked which is privacy and the ability to make your coins almost impossible to track. This solves fungibility, which was one of my main worries for Bitcoin.
I am a long term investor, I am not blinking even with price decreases those days. My investment is like a binary option: either Bitcoin becomes the greatest thing after the Internet or it fails completely. Either way I will be holding for the next years and innovations in technology just make me be more and more positive.

It certainly is a positive for Bitcoin. Let´s remember that Bitcoin has been ALWAYS working since inception. Yes there have been sometimes where the network is facing a clog in capacity but even with that paying the appropriate fee you could get through.

Good thing about Bitcoin is that lots of early adopters continue to be involved in the space and have a lot of money because were early adopters, so it's like Bitcoin is self-funding all the different initiatives.
@_date: 2019-06-30 09:43:03
It is still good news because if people that want to use it this way can, then if you prefer to hold Bitcoin outside the system of KYCs and shit, it will be easier for you to find somebody who wants Bitcoin to exchange. Maybe they give you a service and accept your Bitcoin because they know they can just put it into Coinbase and spend it like fiat.
So obviously this is not what we need and not what we fight for, but anything that gives Bitcoin more possibilities makes it more desirable and valuable for everyone.
@_date: 2019-06-03 18:07:04
Coinjoin is the death of chain analysis. Hope it gets cheaper with new technologies and more people use it.
@_date: 2019-02-20 18:30:18
It could be a solution. I hope it can be implemented in layer 1 though.
@_date: 2019-06-18 21:10:17
I think we don't need to defeat it because they are playing on totally different leagues. It is an asset based on fiat and thus inflationary and subject to Central Banks policies and also is not private, borderless and unconfiscable. It is just a Paypal for Facebook. There is no real need of blockchain to do that.
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:46:34
I partially agree. But the economy precisely crashes because nobody applied austerity when they could (i.e. fiscal responsibility and lower taxes).
@_date: 2019-02-11 08:27:37
"Fundamentals" is not something that applies to Bitcoin.
Neither does technical analysis.
Bitcoin is like investing in start-ups. You look into the start-up business model and you bet that is going to be successful in the future.
But when Microsoft and Google started it was pointless to talk about fundamentals or technical analysis. Had they been listed from the start, you would have observed similar wild fluctuations but no investment strategy would have made sense out of it. The only sane strategy was either to buy and hold if you believed in the idea/technology and not to invest if not.
By treating Bitcoin as if it were a stock you are misleading novice investors and if you truly believe this yourself you will probably lose money trading.
To me, Bitcoin is a binary outcome: either it is successful and gets somewhat mainstream adoption or it is not. And I am prepared to face the consequences if it is not successful, precisely because I invest on it like I would on a start-up, not like I invest most of my savings in stocks or bonds.
@_date: 2019-02-20 20:48:19
Ok but it should not be possible to identify who is doing it, like Coinjoin currently. Otherwise is not anonymous.

But tax for just holding Bitcoin and converting it to fiat is completely unfair. It is like coercing you into holding fiat so they can steal through inflation.

@_date: 2019-06-28 07:59:36
The reasoning behind is to mimic the gold supply. Bitcoin is based on Austrian economics and they advocate for gold standard as an alternative to Central Banks infinitely printing money and stealing via inflation and loss of purchasing power. 
And I am saying also 'loss of purchasing power' because these days inflation has a biased definition. What kind of index measures the cost the regular citizen faces but does not include housing costs? So yeah they tell you there is no inflation but what about your rent? Their monetary policy affects the price of assets the most.
In summary by making the supply tend to zero over 140 years we can create an asset that in theory behaves like gold.
@_date: 2019-02-27 10:35:00
Well what happens in a few year's time when the blockchain takes a considerable amount of space so you have to spend more money on equipment?

Well they followed to death his keynesian recommendations and now he is crying that we head to a recession with rates already at historical lows. What did you expect more taxes, more government spending and more debt funded by monetary policy would bring?
Those are the 'keynesian' stimulus, if they don't work is on you, don't back out now, it is your fault too. You and your cronies have been spreading leftist lies and recipes instead of aiming for a free and productive economy, and this is the result.

The fact they are small is no excuse. The US had most of its growth in history with government representing 8% of GDP. Now is at 37%. In Europe we also hear that levels of government in GDP of 60% (France) are what is normal and people would die in the streets if not. So I am no anarchocapitalist, I believe in the state providing security and some infrastructure. I just think we could trim it down a lot. I would agree to pay 10-15% of my income in taxes. Just not 45% I think this is outrageous.

Also Litecoin +29% surpassed Bcash which is always satisfiying.
@_date: 2019-06-19 11:03:20
So what? They will have a payment system like Weechat already has, which will act like a bank. It won't be an asset protecting you from inflation or being a store of value, it won't be global or censorship resistant. Brings nothing new but it can launder Bitcoin's image or make more people curious about it. Or be a gateway into Bitcoin like Tether (depending on what you can do with Libra).
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:52:31

@_date: 2019-02-20 17:40:29
It will be more difficult for the government to track payments and keep track of the wealth somebody has. For example if one plays the guitar or knows how to code they can give lessons and get paid in Bitcoin, without getting 30-50% stolen. Then can use this BTC to buy stuff in stores that accept it. If done right there is no way to trace this back so it is a little escape from government theft. And they can store this wealth for a long time as opposed to cash that keeps devaluating.
@_date: 2019-02-18 19:06:19

Sometimes the law is clearly unfair. Slavery was once allowed by law. So sometimes doing the right thing (avoiding a little bit of government theft) is considered a crime. By who? Well, by the government of course.
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:44:27
Maybe, but it is inspired in Austrian economics vision and strengthens private property of wealth and constrains the role of government. Also, if adopted, severely constrains government spending and influence.
Of course it is apolitical because it is just a tool, not a party, but in its essence goes against all socialist/communist ideas and has libertarian inspiration.
@_date: 2019-06-28 07:54:59
No because then what you have is a fiat currency that steals from your savings via inflation. I agree that now is being used for speculating, but in the end we want a currency that we can exchange and also store without losing value over time.

@_date: 2019-02-20 09:44:06
Of course it is unfair because the government chooses which unit of account is used. They don't use gold as exempt from gains if you hold it, they choose their fiat currency, dollars for example, so you can choose to either hold dollars and be stolen by inflation or exchange them and be stolen through capital gains tax.
@_date: 2019-06-05 20:34:49
The fact that countries with a strong currency prosper and do well is against this currency depreciation obsession to prompt exports that to me it is just part of a broader obsession to "stimulate" the economy.
Step 1: suffocate the economy with regulations and taxes
Step 2: OMG the economy is not doing well, pls vote me I will do dem stimulus
Step 3: Fiscal stimulus not working country in debt please vote me I'll do more stimulus
Step 4: Can't afford more stimulus pls central bank print money! 
Central Bank: "can't I'm supposed to be independent"
*Replaces head of central bank*
Repeat Step 4: Pls Central Bank I need dem monies
Central Bank: of course my friend, although I would recommend you do structural reforms to remove regulation and lower taxes, and please resolve the debt issue
Government: no impopular reforms pls vote me!
*Monetary stimulus does not work anymore*
Government: need more stimulus

It wouldn't be for everyone, just for people who wouldn't want to assume the risk. Also it can be for companies, where it is easier to settle disputes.
I am not saying is the outcome I want I am saying it is possible in Bitcoin. You could create something that allows you to cancel a transaction within the next 24h to say so. So the receiver already assumes the funds will not be secure up until 2 days. That gives you enough time to make sure he's received the transaction and everything is ok. If ok you just let it be. If you undo the transaction the receiver is going to consider that you didn't pay.
That doesn't need an arbitrator. Now you personally can consider it a drag. For many people this could be added security and some kind of reversibility.
@_date: 2019-02-22 08:18:26

Well that bar in my town was pretty successful. But a bar based on crypto would only be successful if you build a community. Ideally you host networking sessions and Q&amp;A with relevant people in the industry every once in a while. Just making a bar decorated in crypto is not enough.
@_date: 2019-12-10 15:45:33
You could have said that of the previous halvings and the experience is that as you reduce supply, price increases. Also, with 1/10th of current hash rate Bitcoin would be still an extremely secure protocol. We don't have to always keep the same level of hash rate. As long as there is demand, the more scarce Bitcoin issued will be valuable and also there is already a fee market. It is possible that it becomes unprofitable for some miners and they shut down some part of their equipment, but then difficulty will readjust and this will attract more miners or make them turn on the less efficient equipment again.

Bitcoin is not exactly deflationary it just has a decreasing inflation rate. 
You can argue that is deflationary because some Bitcoin get lost but not by design. 
But since fiat currencies are extremely inflationary (much more than they tell us because official inflation rates do not include asset inflation) then by fiat standards Bitcoin is almost deflationary.
@_date: 2019-02-11 18:54:53
Fundamentals exist like they existed in Microsoft when it was a startup. But they would not help you with short term trading with it. Bitcoin has fundamentals like tx per second, but there are much more wilder fluctuations thus fundamental analysis for trading is useless.
@_date: 2019-12-31 09:17:26
Somehow priced in if the market was efficient. But I think Bitcoin is an early market where halvings are not priced in correctly because it's continuously evolving and consequences to the current ecosystem of halving the reward have not been measured. Ecosystem was very different 4 years ago. Also you can't price fiat with continuous QE and increasing monetary inflation.
@_date: 2019-12-11 19:21:40
Sure, I just think it would be cool if the bar incentivised people to use crypto at least, offering the drinks at a discount?
@_date: 2019-12-05 22:45:36
Tor is better but you may have higher speeds with VPN and it is more comfortable to use, and much better certainly for your privacy than no VPN.
If you have a wallet that offers Tor then use it! For transactions and general stuff won't slow you down significantly and it massively improves privacy.
However, I don't think IP is the major concern here, your transactions get tracked because of chain analysis, because they are associated with your name if you purchased from an exchange. So you should also use Coinjoin in order to stay private.
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:30:33
Well everyone can use Bitcoin as they please. Maybe in developing countries where the fiat currency is shit Bitcoin will be more prominent as a method of payment. In developed countries, with Central Banks going full retard and all asset prices inflated, Bitcoin may be a good alternative to put the savings, to avoid theft by inflation and loss of purchasing power of fiat.

Schnorr, taproot, graftroot and MAST can be done via soft fork. So basically worse case scenario anyone willing to will be able to have a high degree of privacy by just passing their coins through the Lightning Network. And this is something nobody can stop if developers put together this soft fork introducing those improvements.

And maybe other privacy coins can also support Lightning atomic swaps so problem solved.
This coupled with Schnorr, Taproot in the base layer should give us enough privacy.

Or don't trade. It's the fastest way to lose Bitcoin because its trajectory is completely random. Long term you'll lose as much as you gain minus transaction costs. Unless you do a few trades only and get extremely lucky but to do so you can also play the lottery. If you don't believe in Bitcoin don't own Bitcoin. If you do, just hodl.

This is why we need to get Bitcoin ready for mass adoption because Governments are becoming increasingly authoritarian.

Well, precisely that. That those services can be provided with a very low and fair tax rate. Thus the abusive tax rates the thread is talking about are not necessary to provide those services.
And normally people justify those rates saying well it is to finance infrastructure and so on. But if Singapore or Switzerland manage to also have infrastructure and basic services with very low taxes we know than more that what those countries tax is not necessary and it is government voracity.

As it becomes more accepted and more liquid it will become less volatile, then more used for payments so more liquid and less volatile, so it will be more used for payments...

That's because these people don't really need Bitcoin because their economies are doing at least ok. So in the west what we have is a period of extremely low rates and the 'attack on savers' and thus people in the developed world found Bitcoin more useful as store of value. Not in Venezuela or Argentina where it is really used to transmit (and also store) value. So Bitcoin is a tool, then people can decide how to use it based on their needs.

What they haven't understood in all those years is that consumption isn't everything. Ok you can disguise a recession now by making people more prone to consume, but you are foregoing savings which would translate in investments, jobs and more productivity, and this is how you get out of recession in the long term. By just making people spend their savings you are not putting an end to the recession.
@_date: 2019-12-11 16:45:42
Yeah I agree. But I don't know I have the feeling that at some point we used to have more heated technical debates, especially on scalability. Now if you scroll through the hot topics half of it is memes, price, generic articles talking about a country regulating something... I don't know man what I would like to find here is a topic about Dandelion, a topic about watchtowers, a topic about Schnorr, Taproot, possibilities of Multisig, how to improve Coinjoins, challenges of Lightning for mass adoption... Those are the sort of debates I'd like to have and learn on and I find quite difficult to find those topics lately.

You have a monthly box from the government with some pasta and stuff (not enough by far) which they use for controlling the population (will you risk losing your only source of food for not supporting the government?) and then if you have family abroad and have dollars you're fine, if not you are screwed. People are dying of hunger and is becoming effectively a split economy where the half of population that has access to dollars is doing "fine" at least not dying of starvation but the half of population with no access to dollars because they don't have savings in USD or family abroad are starving to death.

Normally when there is a recession is because consumption and production have been already mismatched due to artificial stimulus of consumption. Then the economy becomes addicted to this stimulus. Sometimes going through a recession is what the economy needs to purge itself and redirect workers from one sector to another as consumer preferences change. 
Since this is not something politicians are willing to let happen, as they only care about their short mandate, they will do the impossible to avoid it with fiscal and monetary stimulus. This all ends up bad and now we are seeing the consequences: we are at max stimulus in most of the world with government debts at all time highs and interest rates at all time lows. Yet global growth is slowing because of the debt burden.
This is where the keynesian mantra that you have to stimulate consumption has brought us. And obviously keynesians are now clueless wondering what will be the next stimulus for consumption once we have exhausted all of them. Helicopter money?

Well until when? If you use ricochet from Samurai (provides multiple hops between addresses), split the coins and do diffetent Coinjoins at different stages then until when those funds are yours? Because what if you buy something with the BTC fresh from the exchange and the next person goes into online gaming? You will also get shit from the exchange?
What if after the money changes 10 times then somebody does a Coinjoin, will the exchange also give you shit for that?
@_date: 2019-04-04 07:23:01
Yes but you can't withdraw the Bitcoin you would have to sell it and buy it somewhere else in order to store it.
@_date: 2019-04-07 23:03:25
Great, that's very positive because Coinjoins protect more people than only those actually going for it, as it makes the coins untraceable before the Coinjoin point. Meaning if lots of people start using it we all win because Bitcoin will be more fungible.  That's why is such great news if Trezor incorporates it.
@_date: 2019-04-09 11:57:06
I am telling you. I tried several transfers. First 2 went throug and the other ones were rejected by Coinbase. Then Revolut wouldn't let me do the payment with a warning that "it needs to be a personal bank account in order to make payments to Coinbase". Or something like that. Very weird.
I still don't know what's going on but I got like 3 payments rejected from Coinbase.
I was not doing card payments though, I was doing bank transfers.
@_date: 2019-04-16 15:40:54
Well not for the exchange you just sent it to, you would have the same problem because this exchange will require KYC.
Options are:
Use Wasabi wallet and mix your coins (Coinjoin)
Do it through Lightning (althoug Lightning still has to evolve to be easier to use)

It is different. In QE you introduce money but put an asset in the Central Bank balance sheet as it 'purchases' it. For example when purchasing debt this means deferred taxes to be paid thus an asset.
The other way is pure money creation with no asset, just straight to the government for spending so it has much worse consequences.

Well sorry you had to go through this situation.
But I don't think this qualifies as 'scam' since it is quite obvious to the person being scammed what's going on and they pull out the cash from your hands by force... I would say this is outright theft.
I am also kind of surprised that they let you have the cash in your hands because they find themselves in a difficult position. No one is going to say 'oh ok my bad I sent it to the wrong address here is your cash I am sorry'.
So it is a shit scam, it will always end up with a fight in a public place, they would be better off mugging people directly. Dumb fucks.
@_date: 2019-04-11 17:50:15
This is true and I buy everything you say. But still I don't think we should bash it, we should welcome innovation and everything that means more avenues and more ways to express value ultimately with Bitcoin. Also a bank like Coinbase with Bitcoin is not the ideal thing but it is a great leap forward because you have a coin that does not get depreciated by Central Banks.
Obviously what we want is to skip the intermediary completely, but this takes time and for some people they will never feel comfortable/responsible enough. So I prefer them being introduced to Bitcoin and having something closer to the current system. Once they have peaked into the rabbit hole some of them will go deeper.

Sometimes Wasabi takes a bit to update the transaction history. I read recently that it had to do with Tor. I.e. that Tor was experimenting some problems and that would reflect on Wasabi being a bit slower at updating. But no worries when it says sent it is, it just needs to confirm, and it appears in the transaction history after a while. Coins are not lost for issues like that. Either sent or not sent.
@_date: 2019-04-22 22:21:12

Bitcoin SV has 1.3% of BTC's market cap so I assume hashpower more or less in the same proportion. Since it has the same PoW algorithm, why don't we just attack the chain? No loyal BTC miner that can do that? Maybe some reorg. attack or just mining empty blocks for a week?

Maybe the most perfect way then (with the technologies known and feasible today) is to use Lightning to clean the funds. That is you have wallets A (related to your identity) and B created just now, open channels with different nodes and start sending funds with various intermediate hops. Once you close the channel this is very difficult to track. If the paths between nodes are random enough NSA would have to own most or all nodes between the two wallets, or essentially own most nodes in the Lightning Network. That's more difficult to accomplish than the Coinjoin attack.
Also couldn't we easily create a Lightning app that does just this, automatically, and looking for the longest path possible? (i.e. the more hops the better?)
@_date: 2019-04-24 10:41:38
And that is without counting Lightning and Liquid sidechains.
@_date: 2019-04-15 13:26:21
If it is a soft fork it is not the same case as with BCH and you don't have to choose sides because it is all the same coin. Shcnorr in itself does not bring privacy, but will make Coinjoin and other options more efficient. You can still move your coins to a Schnorr address and choose not to do privacy.
That said, to me privacy is way more important than the rest and needs to be done at a base layer.
How will it work in terms of regulation? Well the same that it works for cash. If you want to declare crypto earnings you will have to prove where they come from. When you do it with cash this cash is still fungible.
I think more privacy will make Bitcoin better and more valued, not the opposite. If we can achieve a decent level of privacy and fungibility we would make Monero and other coins useless.

They will be financed by savings as it should have always been, not by credit issued by a Central Bank.
In other words if I trust you I would lock my Bitcoin for a year, giving it to you in a multisig transaction that states that I will get them back with the interest we agree. You may have to put a small deposit in this multisig address that I can get if you don't pay the interest. Something like that. Or there can be an intermediary spreading the risk amongst investors.
The point is that loans will be really backed by savings which is healthy and if all currencies worked like that moat probably we wouldn't have the big credit cycles that result in huge financial crises.

At some point is it possible, with any of those technologies, to reach the point where somebody analysing the blockchain can't tell if a transaction is a Coinjoin or any other kind of privacy transaction?
 I think this is the point where everyone gets a lot of privacy by default, that's where we want to get. As long as you can distinguish who does privacy and who doesn't it is not strong enough.
@_date: 2019-04-03 16:37:26
If a country wants to help Bitcoin what they should do is stop taxing every transaction if there are capital gains. This is what makes Bitcoin difficult to use if you follow the rules.

Interesting point. But if say 10-15 participants are also queuing and get in and the NSA can't slot in all other participants but you it is practically very difficult. Also I expect there will be more implementations than just Wasabi so difficult for the NSA to keep occupying absolutely all slots in all Conjoins ever.
At some point, to counter-attack this, the wallet could have a service to bring in some random funds, also participating in the Coinjoin, to guarantee that the NSA or any other service can't get all slots but yours.

I see that mainstream media have been doing their homework during those 5 years.
@_date: 2019-04-16 12:20:31
Ok but much harder and with plausible deniability. If your coins go to a Coinjoin the exchange then has to track 100 paths that divide and also go through coinjoins and Lightning and other stuff. If any of those by then tens of thousands of paths lead at the end to a gambling site you can just claim those weren't yours.
@_date: 2019-12-09 12:57:49
Theoretically some time locked contracts or escrows would be possible in Bitcoin for retail uses. The fact that transfers at the base layer are irreversible doesn't mean a different vehicle can be built for people that want a bit of reassurance and to be possible to revert transactions if different parties, which could include arbitrage, agree.
@_date: 2019-04-20 09:56:20
But at some point, if the demand for dollar decreases, you can have very high inflation if you print lots of money to repay the debt.

Schnorr+Taproot+Multisig which I think will come as one update.
The reason is that it kills 2 birds in one shot: increases scalability and also allows for better privacy.
@_date: 2019-04-15 14:11:02
I think you are mixing stuff here. There is no two forks so if Bitcoin goes to the moon for the legacy one then it goes to the moon too for Schnorr because it is the same exact coin. There is no Segwit vs legacy because it is the same coin. If users change to Schnorr, exchanges will change too. As I said, it is possible to do Schnorr without privacy, so why wouldn't they do that if fees will be way cheaper with Schnorr?
@_date: 2019-04-16 15:43:33
But other projects are not as secure and liquid as Bitcoin and cannot scale. So we need to find ways to make Bitcoin at least decently private. I think Schnorr will make Coinjoins easier and cheaper and Lightning is private by default.
@_date: 2019-04-21 02:52:42
A clear regulation that for instance doesn't require to declare capital gains tax for purchases below $500 would be a HUGE boost to BTC. We don't need politicians but it is a nice have. Also it means we have won the ideological battle once it reaches the politicians.

For more peace of mind: nothing would stop you from sending your BTC back to a legacy address again, same that happens with Segwit.

I was in Cuba a while ago. The problem is that most of the population doesn't even have Internet at home or a smartphone with 3g. You have to go to a public square and buy a Wifi key. It is really expensive. So it may be a bit difficult for Bitcoin to progress in Cuba.
I would say Bitcoin works very well for countries that had the infrastructure but where things got worse, like Venezuela.
In countries that have been under socialism (thus are poor) for a long time like Cuba Bitcoin adoption will take more time.
@_date: 2019-04-22 22:19:23
You can either use Lightning (side chain option) or do a Coinjoin (main chain option) so it can't be traced back to you.
You can have your savings in cold storage and then do a Coinjoin and have some BTC for spending. By either doing this or using the Lightning Network people will not be able to tell how many Bitcoins you have in your savings address or in cold storage.

Yeah various pools run by this person or that inconditionally support him. At the end of the day BCH has 6% or so of BTC hash rate. The difference is that this person is willing to put all hash rate to work in BCH even if he loses money, whereas the other miners may act more rationally.

@_date: 2018-11-02 08:30:08
Not sure I am following. You have 19.8 BTC, you send 10 to Coinjoin and then the 9.8 you don't? Why wouldn't you Coinjoin all of them?
If you are paranoid you can then send to Samourai after the Coinjoin and use Ricoche when sending to the exchange (artificially adds 5 hops).
Then the exchange would have to go back more than 5 hops, find a Coinjoin transaction and so what?
From the other direction authorities follow 19.8 BTC that go into Coinjoin, maybe various rounds (let's say 4) and then they have 400 addresses and only onr should be the correct one. 0.25% chance of being the one they were looking for. Of those addresses some do some more hopes where the money gets spread, in the end of the day it may get spread into 5 pieces so you have 2000 adresses to track and that are constantly trading with others.
And all you would see in the address that is the darknet one is that some of those after doing some hopes more get eventually to an exchange, like maybe 1000 of the addresses you are following. And maybe if you monitor it for a month or two it is 100.000 addresses.
So where do you put the cut? How many hops? For how long? From where a Coinjoin transaction happens all hope is lost for analytical companies to reasonably estimate which coins were tainted.
If you are paranoid just do 3-4 Coinjoin rounds, move the  coins between addresses, then use Samourai with ricoche when sending to the exchange.
@_date: 2018-03-15 12:46:17
The problem is not with banks but with Central Banks. It is incredible how Central banks got away with no blaming almost when they caused the financial crises by artificially lowering interest rates.
@_date: 2018-11-01 21:58:17
They cannot be traced because once you get to the Coinjoin transaction you don't know where the tainted coins went, you would have to consider all 100 parties involved in the transaction and all their Bitcoin tainted. And of those if 40 at some point get coinjoined again then you consider 4.000 tainted? At some point this analysis gets ridiculous and impossible. Whenever authorities find a Coinjoin transaction they will know they lost trace.
And if they want to make tainted all Bitcoin from Coinjoin transactions then how many hops before? Because at some point most of it will have been at some point Coinjoined. 10 hopes before? Fine I'll just create 10 addresses.
It is a lost game. Coinjoin is a win for privacy and fungibility.
@_date: 2018-03-13 13:43:00

Ok but then if lots of people use it it will be almost impossible for you not to accept BTC that have been mixed at some point. Then the question starts: how many hops back do you look? 10? Fine I'll just create 10 addresses and send to myself then to you.
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:49:47
That is how a currecy should work, as a medium of exchange, neutral. It should not have somebody deciding the interest rate and deciding who wins and who loses (if debtors vs indebted, importers vs exporters, people holding cash vs assets, sophisticated vs unsophisticated investors) that is why Bitcoin is a better currency than fiat
@_date: 2018-11-03 13:35:31
Ok but does the wallet do this automatically? i.e. if I put 1BTC to mix will it keep mixing it until all BTC has been mixed? Or do I need to manually queue each 0.1 BTC?
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:55:15
That's true. On the other hand I don't expect it to go to zero, as you don't expect it when investing in a start up. I am saying this should be the mindset.
@_date: 2018-11-07 08:21:44
Please leave some thread in r/bitcoin where we can comment this shit, and grab some popcorn when the fork is happening. Of course is about an altcoin but may have impact on Bitcoin price and we can extract many lessons from this.

If I were you I would get a hardware wallet, easy to use and secure. I recommend Trezor.
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:09:24
But he can't. Nobody has enough hashpower to destroy BTC. And there is another difference. If you destroy BCH you can always go back to mine BTC and you don't lose the investment. Destroy BTC and you lose most of your mining equipment investment.
@_date: 2018-11-06 08:37:12
Guys let's not fool ourselves, having a node is nice but you can basically do without and running it is costly and most of users won't do it. 
Even more, if Bitcoin gets more adoption it will be more and more costly to run a node.
There should be some system by which a % of fees went to nodes. That way if Bitcoin increased in adoption and became more expensive to run a node people who did would get compensated.
I think Lightning may provide a good incentive, because if you run a Lightning node you do receive fees, and you need a Bitcoin node for this.
@_date: 2018-11-05 18:55:57
I would bounce it via Trezor creating a new account or Samourai (Samourai has the plus of having Ricochet which adds 5 hops to your transaction making it less likely that it gets blacklisted or something).
@_date: 2018-11-01 13:54:09

Bitcoin is great but if a pretty girl promotes it helps
@_date: 2018-11-06 08:21:28
In many ways, let's assume it splits 50/50% it would have less hashrate which means would be more prone to attacks. Then when it splits there can be replay attacks on both chains. In general this fork will be bad for PR and also if people see Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Bitcoin Gold... At the end of the day they'll get tired of shitcoins and turn to the original which is the most secure and has a conservative policy as opposed to "let's increase the blocksize to 128MB without much testing, just because".
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:24:16
People don't like uncertainty and they don't understand the fork and its implications.
If that was the cause it will be fine because it will only have consequences for BCH. Once people realise it is fine for other coins the bleeding will stop.
@_date: 2018-03-24 19:39:07
That answers my question, thank you. So if we can get Lightning transactions to be anonymous that provides a huge amount of privacy to Bitcoin. My worry was that then somehow the first address would still show up in the Blockchain linking the two ends.
@_date: 2018-11-02 15:02:53
How does it work if instead of 0.1 you wanted to convert 0.5? Do you need to wait for 5 cycles?
Can I send to Wasabi from Trezor?
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:21:06
Because it is not profitable, the hash tends to align with the price of cryptos because otherwise miners are taking a loss or a cost of opportunity. But in this case he is not doing so to go against BTC but to try to impose the version he thinks should survive in the BCH chain. So this is only temporary and nothing to be afraid of if you hold BTC.
@_date: 2018-11-06 08:23:08
It will dump after because people are quite retarded when it comes to forks. They see it as getting a new free token and they don't realise that most probably the market cap of both after the fork is less than the total market cap now.
@_date: 2018-11-03 17:06:43
No sorry I don't have a suggestion, but I don't know for instance Trezor estimates the fee such that if you select to "normal" it confirms within the next hour or so. I think this should be the aim.

What if you already have BTC? You would have to risk an exchange to Monero.
Bitcoin has much more liquidity and Monero has even more scaling problems than Bitcoin (if it had the same proportion of transactions).
So the point is, even though Monero is a more private and fungible coin, it is still great news that pricacy solutions are available in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-27 09:37:54
Antonopoulos said first the merkle tree implementation is going to come, likely 2018 and then Schnorr signatures shortly after.
Anobody able to explain to which degree Schnorr is am increase in privacy? Have read many articles but I still don't understand.
@_date: 2018-11-06 08:25:55
It will have less hashrate so more insecure and prone to attacks. There will be replay attacks with possible loss of funds between both chains. In general Bcash will feel like the less secure option, it may fall into market cap rankings... I just think it will be bad for PR as well, the value of crypto lays in security and stability, something Bitcoin has so I think people will resort to the original.
@_date: 2018-11-03 15:48:21
Wasabi is great for privacy. It connects through Tor and it has a very easy interface to use Coinjoin to mix your coins and thus make them anonymous.
@_date: 2018-11-05 17:09:16
Well say you want to send funds to Julian Assange but you want to be anonymous. You take a piece of your BTC which is linked to you, mix it and then send. This is just a possible example.
@_date: 2018-11-15 12:26:56
BCH difficulty adjusts every day or so so it would compensate and adjust to the price making Bitcoin much more profitable to mine.
@_date: 2018-11-04 16:52:58
I found a good source explaining the fork: [
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:35:26
I think it has to do with the BCH fork tomorrow and the hash war it entails. Investors just perceive volatility and sell, mainly because they don't understand the implications and the fact that BTC is in no danger.

Coreection, both will be forks of Bcash: Bcash ABC and Bcash SV. There isn't the original and then someone forking like happened with Bitcoin.

U mad because BCH is 6% of Bitcoin's market cap.?
@_date: 2018-11-02 14:04:25
Well simply do various Coinjoins with different amounts?
Also everybody in the Coinjoint has the same amount, so it is not traceable.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:11:34
We need to understand that Bitcoin has value if it gets adopted and we need to continue to push for adoption and care less about the price. Because if we get adoption price will come after it.

It will get to a point where it will stabilise and keep its value steady, increasing slowly respect of fiat just because fiat are inflationary in nature.
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:38:06
I really recommend Trezor. Good philosophy of Satoshilabs, good client attention, easy to use, secure, one of the first rk introduce Segwit...
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:53:09
But which one? Gold is already really expensive, as are stocks. Yes Bitcoin is an optio  but too risky for most. The inflation and the hidden inflation (assets, real estate, stocks) are really fucked up and nobody see.s to understand. Now my choice of hedge is Bitcoin but not sure for instance my father or my family can bear the risk, so I am really mad at central banks messing with the savings of regular people.
@_date: 2018-11-08 14:49:19
The point they miss is that Bitcoin could scale without mining energy scaling in paralel to it. However, if you want to use more gold you need to mine more gold and spend more energy.
Bitcoin with Lightning for example can do 1000x more TX and spend the same in terms of energy. If you increase the blocksize, even with the same hashrate, you can do more transactions using the same energy. Journalists fail to understand that it is not mining per use or per transaction, but that there is a certain leven of proof of work that protects the network and makes it more secure but that doesn't need to be higher in order to hold more transactions.
@_date: 2018-11-03 09:30:15
But what if you have 1BTC then you need to wait 6 cycles?
@_date: 2018-11-07 19:23:59
Yet some technologies, like Lightning, provide scalability and help in fungibility as well.
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:41:58
Most of altcoins are useless. They have been feeding on Bitcoin's problems to scale but with Segwit adoption (30%), Lightning Network being deployed and other scaling improvements like Schnorr signatures, Bitcoin is set for years.
@_date: 2018-11-04 11:30:40
Ok I understand but still 7 days to me seems a long shot, if there is a suddent increase in tx and the mempool starts being slightly more full there are chances the transaction doesn't confirm.
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:22:17
Well when Bitcoin volatility goes down and then people see it keeps its value because supply is limited as opposed to fiat, that may be their top 1 option to hold Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-01 21:53:48
But you can put more in each coinjoin right?
@_date: 2018-11-04 17:11:12
Which one is the worse chain though? Difficult to tell.
@_date: 2018-11-28 08:25:50
Very easy to use. The easiest way to do a Coinjoin and anonimise your coins.

Not fungible yet but we will get there
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:27:44
As long as the coin has value it will be profitable to mine, and if not the difficulty will adjust.

@_date: 2018-11-07 08:25:35
No it's not because you need to be able to redeem it and this can be controlled and shut down. This is the reason why gold is not a viable solution either.
Crypto can be hidden from governments, you don't need to redeem it ideally at some point you'll be able to spend.

They know the difference but they don't care. You can invest in a stock or invest in an S&amp;P fund. You sell when there are market jitters but maybe there is nothing wrong with one stock, but you just sell it anyway with the market. That is how some whales operate, how do you explain, if not, that all altcoins move together?

There is from the moment exchanges can do blacklisting. The more we do mixing, Lightning network, and other solutions, the harder or uselesness of blacklisting, thus improved fungibility.

Probably the sum of market cap of both coins will be lower than the current market cap of Bcash

That's what happens for dumping money into shitcoins like Bcash.

But in the end there is the net position, and futures also need hedging so in the end trading in CFDs or futures gets channelled in one of the ways through the real asset (Bitcoin)

If a TX has gone through 2 coinjoins then 15 hops and gets to you is still tainted where there is less than 0.1% possibilities that the tainted coins originated from you?
@_date: 2018-11-06 08:21:10
In many ways, let's assume it splits 50/50% it would have less hashrate which means would be more prone to attacks. Then when it splits there can be replay attacks on both chains. In general this fork will be bad for PR and also if people see Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Bitcoin Gold... At the end of the day they'll get tired of shitcoins and turn to the original which is the most secure and has a conservative policy as opposed to "let's increase the blocksize to 128MB without much testing, just because"
@_date: 2018-03-24 19:51:21
You still need to trust a third party. They could still take those exchanges down. Instead if the Lightning thing works you could anonymise your coins easily by yourself.
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:19:38
It has to do with the BCash hard fork tomorrow and people fearing it may involve a hash war and some hash will be pulled off from Bitcoin. But nothing major will happen to Bitcoin. Bcash on the other hand will split.

Coinjoin is the true way to go for privacy

When Coinbase implements Segwit the mempool will be clear for a year. That's what we were saying when we said Segwit could buy time for Lightning to prosper

If you invest in Bitcoin like the stock of a mature company (i.e. a significant quantity and buying/selling with the trend) you will get hurt badly.
I see Bitcoin as an investment in a startup. If you invested in Facebook, Microsoft or Amazon in the early days you couldn't even know the value as it was not listed, but probably it would look somewhat like that (very volatile and difficult to price).
I tend to see more Bitcoin as a binary event: it either progresses in adoption and becomes more mainstream or it fails completely.
I risked an investment I am willing to lose and I buy periodically quantities I could afford to lose, just like if I was investing in a startup.
And so I don't care if the price goes to 5k or 10k or 20k in the short term, because I am not going to sell in either case. If Bitcoin gets to mainstream adoption, then I will probably sell part of it, when is 6 figures. If it goes to zero so be it.
If you are glued to the daily price of Bitcoin, in my opinion, you are taking the wrong approach. You don't invest in a startup to pull up the day, week, or month after, you leave the investment there for years and follow the development of its technology and if it is successful you exit, if not you probably lose your investment.
But if you are daily trading it it could be the case that it goes to six figures and you have only been losing along the way.
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:30:48
Because you don't simply lose a sack of money, but losing the key I would say could be quite common
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:58:02
Good point! Yeah I hope Trezor or Ledger address this point. First privacy and Coinjoin transactions need to go a bit more mainstream I guess.
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:32:39
This will happen in 140 years, but basically the fees will be enough to keep miners incentivised

Every other currency is taxable otherwise nobidy would use fiat currencies. We would just stick to gold.
@_date: 2018-11-01 22:26:45
Well it is a great step towards fungibility or it improves fungibility. Nobody said it makes Bitcoin 100% fungible yet. But again I believe if a great % of users do coinjoin transactions, even if it is the 5% most conscious about privacy, it will just make most of transactions untreaceable because it would mean every 20 tranactions you would find a coinjoin on average. It means all Bitcoin would be tainted. If we achieve this we achieve a great degree of fungibility, although not 100%&gt;
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:33:44
Remember that the Bcash crew were blocking Segwit for over a year. If it weren't for this it would have always felt like the good old days.

The fundamental value of the technology is increasing with many innovations such as Lightning, Merkle trees and Schnorr signatures. The price is volatile but if you stay for the long term you should care about the technology.
@_date: 2018-03-24 19:37:44
Yes but my worry was when you settle in the blockchain
@_date: 2018-11-04 22:38:28
No, you only gain anonimity. But hey it could be a way to get more liquidity, to pay some fee to parties willing to leave their Bitcoin there for mixing.
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:40:59
No because the address that settles has no connection in the blockchain with the first address

After Segwit adoption rose to 30% it has no advantage over Bitcoin but many flaws (i.e. does not have Segwit, no transaction malleability fix, less decentralised, less hash power, no Lightning... And in general is getting behind most of the improvements coming to Bitcoin like Merkle trees or Schnorr signatures)

Well if Coingeek has declared war, it seems like there will be right?
@_date: 2018-11-05 12:30:14
If the big blockers had not delayed Segwit for over a year we would have achieved much more by now. They created a false urgency of block size increase by blocking a solution that was already tested, solved some structural problems and could be implemented with a soft fork.
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:43:01
This means countries will need to print money to pay it, which will create inflation, which is good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:56:37
Because they took a long time to implement Segwit (hopefully it comes this month) and in some occasions they have had an ambiguous position with regards to forks like Segwit2X and Bcash instead of strongly supporting Bitcoin
You will hear about fees and stuff,but the real reaso  for hatred is the outlined above
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:54:34
Well I work in the financial sector and that's basically how a brokerage business operates. When you buy CFD's on a share, be it long or short, at the other end there is a trader hedging those positions, making sure the net balance of the broker is neutral. If they would be taking positions it would be a Hedge fund, I think it is not the case. So in order to hedge a position when somebody buys a CFD contract in Bitcoin they need to buy Bitcoin, Bitcoin futures or any alternative. Otherwise they are assuming a huge risk if Bitcoin price goes up. Or otherwise a huge risk in Bitcoin price going down for a short CFD.
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:43:25
Because of quantitative easing and near zero interest rates most equities are selling at ridiculous P/Es so no matter you buy a good company you are likely to get burned when interestsgo back to normal levels.
I like equities it is just that right now the game is rigged. Buying crypto is like saying "I am not playing your rigged game anymore"

Somebody raised that if you send your mixed coins to Trezor somebody could send dust and then Trezor could spend this dust and reveal your identity as it does not separate coins.
However, this could be avoided by creating another "account" right? Trezor lets you create account 1, account 2, account 3... If you have account 1 where you have done some public transactions and it has old addresses linked to you where dust could be sent, if you just create account 2 and only use it with mixed coins, then this account is not vulnerable to such attack, right?

They claimed to solve the problems they were creating.

Well this is positive since they will make new discoveries in the technology and put research on it. Not likely to compete with Bitcoin since probably they want to do it for other purposes, even if they created a cryptocurrency for fast payments it would be centralised and boring. But keep up the research in blockchain, it is welcome.

Bitcoin will be fine, maybe a little bit of fee increase but will be absolutely fine. Bcash however will be split in the best of scenarios and enter into a destructive war in the worst of scenarios. When everyone discovers that altcoins are not as secure as Bitcoin there will be an increase in BTC dominance.

I am here for the long run. I hold Bitcoin because I believe it will become a mainstream store of value as well as way of transmitting value. I am here because I think in 15-20y Bitcoin will have revolutionised finance like the Internet did. I honestly don't care what is the price of Bitcoin at the end of this year or what it was at the beginning. Instead, I am looking at how fast the technology advances and the technological propositions to come. And this does not look bearish at all.

Long story short: they do scheduled hard forks every 6 months just because, the next one is 15-Nov. ABC are the usual developers, they introduced some controversial upgrades that didn't like to everyone. Another competing version SV sponsored by Craig Wright presented another upgrade to counteract ABC's one. There will be a contentious hard fork with no replay protection.

@_date: 2018-02-22 23:04:51
Imagine 100% utilisation Segwit, we have leeway for years until Lightning is widely adopted together with other solutions. Clearly we are on the right track.
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:02:31
But if you transfer your crypto out and make it anonymous from there on you could just say that you lost the keys if authorities ask what you did with it
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:49:55
They don't need to allow it. It is just happening already.
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:10:13
And that's with Segwit adoption at 14%
Clearly Segwit is a good enough solution in the short term. If Bitcoin is not constrained at 14% imagine when we get at 40-50% (likely when Coinbase implements this month) and imagine at higher rates
Clearly Core got it right and clearly the block size increase per se was not the correct strategy
Segwit will buy enough time for the Lightning Network to develop and we will have a capacity inimaginable by increasig the block size without giving up decentralisation
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:52:14
Could also be Coinbase activating Segwit, do we know?

If you are a HK organisation fighting for freedom you should be sophisticated enough to:
1. Ask for donations straight in Bitcoin, no intermediaries
2. Either use Bitcoin to pay for some of the resources you need or exchange them in a decentralised echange like Bisq, difficult to track
3. In the process, ideally use Wasabi wallet to mix the coins

Well it is related, the more Bitcoin that goes through Lightning the more fungible as cannot be traced back.

You can do it, the problem is that you can't do it all at once. And if you do it gradually or it takes several days it serves no purpose. However, due to the chips hitting Moore's law, China is losing its advantage of being close to the chip manufacturers. Which means gradually and over time mining will become more decentralised.

@_date: 2018-07-23 16:25:42
It is a bit difficult to answer this question without explaining the whole context but I will try to summarize it:
When the oil price was +$100 a barrel and Venezuela was producing +3M the Government used this money to subsidise everything and win votes. That is why gasoline is mostly free and electricity is subsidised. But socialists only know how to spend other people's money and disregard the investments and maintenance parts, let alone the respect for private property or the laws of supply and demand.
The point is, during early 2000s they were basically destroying everything they touched with nationalisations and messing with the exchange rate and the Central Bank, but the consequences were not yet felt because they were getting hard dollars from oil and they could keep subsidising everything. But the rest of the economy was anihilated until oil exports were 97% of Venezuela's exports.
As I was saying socialists did what they do best: spend. They would spend all this money in 'dem programmes' for the poor and to subsidise everything. They did zero maintenance to the electrical and water infrastructure and also to the oil infrastructure. And now we see the consequences. They are producing half the oil (because of years of mismanagement) and oil is lower in price. Not only that since refineries are not working either Venezuela is actually importing light oil to blend in with theirs. They also have agreements with China so not all of the oil they sell is for revenue but as payment of former debts.
The consequence is that they don't have enough hard currency and all of it is destined to import of food and a few basic stuff.
But they still want to keep the "revolution" rethoric alive so basically they keep subsidising electricity and gasoline at a loss and obviously there is an immense fiscal gap that they cover by printing money, thus the hyperinflation.
Due to lack of maintenance there are constant cuts in electricity supply, sometimes for hours, making it really tough for businesses. And since the country is short of hard currency and they have destroyed all the industrial production so they don't produce shit, now they find it hard to import components to repair electricity supply, water supply or even spare parts for buses so there is no public transport by bus in most cities.
Hope it answers the question.

Bitcoin gets more publicity from those news that were everywhere on the media than actual attention from scam publicity in those platforms. People not interested in Bitcoin may read this and tell themselves "why are they banning this? I am curious let me just Google it".

Shorting does only affect price in the short term. I mean if you sell you want to cover the short position at some point right? And if there continues to be demand you are screwed. It is the same with shares: you can short a company but you can't make the share price permanently depressed if the company keeps doing ok. Likewise don't worry about the shorts. Is good liquidity and most of institutional investors just want to win money like you and me, will buy if they think is undervalued and sell if they think is overvalued. Thus providing liquidity.
More liquidity = less volatility = more utility = higher price
This is good. Bitcoin can take anything. The more people uses it the better even if it is for shorting. Ultimately this will not decide the price long term.

Yes but currently private blockchains like Monero are not scalable.
Also it is not that complicated because everything goes in the background.
What you would really do is open two accounts in Lightning like you open a normal wallet, then move the coins through there like you do onchain transactions.
For now, it is a way in which Bitcoin can scale to do more transactions than Visa and provide privacy and fungibility.
If a lot of people start doing this, even if you do transactions onchain those may be more private (i.e. if you transact with somebody who then makes those Bitcoin go through Lightning and then does something illegal with them those will not be traced to you).
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:28:11

@_date: 2018-07-19 13:24:07
A wallet's code can be audited, you don't need to trust anybody more than for an onchain transaction.
Using decentralised exchanges to exchange BTC to Monero you pay the bid-ask spread which is not sustainable. Doing it via Lightning you pay almost nothing.
Cryptos have difficulty scaling on chain without privacy. Let alone with privacy. Maybe at some point it will be possible, I hope so. I am just saying that Lightning will be ready much sooner, with the one coin that is easier to obtain, most liquid and most secure and I am happy to have this solution in the medium term.
@_date: 2018-04-28 06:50:14

But this wouldn't be Lightning transactions. It would be a transaction that 10 times ago went through Lightning for example. You see it as a transaction in the blockchain and you start to reconstruct the path to get to an identity but you can't because you are missing the last step when this money was converted from fiat, for example.
@_date: 2018-07-18 11:32:29
Say you acquire Bitcoin from an exchange where you had to provide your passport. Then you transfer it to your hard wallet address A. This is now tainted and every movement you do with those Bitcoin on chain can be traced back to you.
However, you can open a channel with a random node in Lightning. Then create another address in your wallet "address B" and open a channel with a random node.
Then using Lightning you send Bitcoin in random quantities from address A to address B, making sure there are as many hops as possible. Transactions in Lightning use a onion-like protocol like Tor, where the transaction is encrypted in a way that the current node only knows the node before and after, only one hop, not who issued the transaction or who is the receiver.
Also those transactions are not registered in any blockchain or anywhere, just random nodes have incpmplete information almost impossible to trace.
Then you just close your channel and from looking at the Blockchain nobody can tell addresses A and B are related. Your Bitcoin is not "tainted" anymore with your identity.
If you are paranoid you can repeat this process with C and D addresses making it virtually impossible to trace.
Obviously for that we need Lightning to be able to operate at more capacity and be at a more advanced phase.

The thing about Bitcoin Cash is getting really annoying. They have a subreddit BTC with specifically the ticker of Bitcoin which is only about Bcash. And the twitter account  all the same, just promoting Bcash.
I am not against them promoting their coin, but this is intentionally trying to mislead people. If you want to promote Bitcoin Cash is it that hard to use BCH or "Bitcoin Cash" names? Why do they have to keep confusing people?

If the Bcash and big block suppoters didn't block Segwit for some time it wouldn't have lost so much ground.

Also remember Lightning. All you will need to do make it untraceable is open a new address and transfer the Bitcoin through Lightning. Once you close the channel (and the channel doesn't even need to be open to the other address directly) there will be no way to trace this transaction thanks to Lightning´s TOR like encryption.
It is clear that Schnorr and Bulletproofs will improve it to and onchain, but we just have the solution already implemented on the mainnet.
@_date: 2018-04-11 08:21:31
Yes, we need adoption but it will take time, just like the Internet. And when it happens it will be like a self-fulfilling prophecy because the more users the more liquidity, less volatility and more adotption. Also we are in a time with low inflation but if inflation hits, cryptos will be a more attractive asset. We just need to make sure that the technology (Lightning for example) is there when we need mass adoption.

Well all I am saying is that if they can link a transaction with an identity this is mitigated by the fact that they can't link it to the total funds and all transaction history of this individual if the purchase was done via Lightning.
@_date: 2018-04-28 09:18:12
I am not saying it will not be needed in the future, most  probably yes. I am saying I am in favour of getting Segwit adoption to 100%, batching, Schnorr, Merkle trees, Lightning and other possible improvements and when we reach a point where it cannot be optimised further then 2X. I get the point of a part of the community about increasing the block size. What I don't get is why they would have to block Segwit because none of the reasons they gave were true. Couldn't they support Segwit and once adoption is 100% ans we hit a hurdle then pusb for a block size increase? S2X would have never been necessarh in Deceber if Segwit had been implemented for a year and at +50% adoption, that was my point. And that the solution, right now, is to push for more adoption and optimisations, because as of now we don't yet need to choose between more capacity and decentralisation.

Lightning transactions will be anonymous right? So just don't declare it. The tax system knows when you purchase Bitcoin with fiat and when you change it back to fiat, not how much Bitcoin you own or spend.
This is a cumbersome and unfair law to force you to use their fiat money. It is totally ok from a moral point of view to ignore stupid laws like this one.
You would not be laundering money or doing something wrong, for god´s sake you would just buy Bitcoin with your money and spend Bitcoin. They are the ones that need to get their shit together and make an exception on the capital gains law.

Of course, but we always knew that, it is no crypto flaw since you are giving them your address. I think there is the possibility to sending it to a postal address right? And you just need a reference to collect it, not a name? Not sure how it works but could be an option.

Just like he did with the  Doesn´t he understand that no matter how many propaganda hubs he buys the Bcash thing is not happening because people is not retarded?

But in the end if after Schnorr, Merkle trees, Segwit 100%, batching, Lightning and many solutions that are still to come we get full blocks and there is no other way to scale we will simply increase the block size, and this increase will get leveraged many times by all those technologies.
My point is BCH has no advantage over Bitcoin whatsoever, because after all if it comes to a point when the blocksize needs to be increased we will do it.
So no matter the outcome, BCH is just a copycat with a boring solution that BTC could implement whenever it pleases, with less developers, less interesting projects, no access to Lightning, and more centralised.
No, there is not any scenario where BCH does not become useless.

Even if you don't care about centralisation is not a good idea. At some point you would hit a hurdle with bandwith and latency if the blocks are 1 peta-byte for example and have difficulty checking all transactions and transmitting it to the next node. It would be hard for all nodes to receive the next block in under 10mins.
@_date: 2018-04-28 06:39:47
Segwit increased already the block size to 2-4MB. At 35% adoption most of blocks are no longer full. Which proves Segwit was a good enough solution for now and there is no need to double the block size again. Maybe if there are no further ways of optimising transactions or using second layers it will come to the point where we will need to increase the block size. But there is just no point in giving up decentralisation when it is not necessary.

I'm fucking tired really of having to justify Bitcoin's existence and whether people uses it for good or bad.
Bitcoin, just like the Internet or cash is a tool and people chooses to use it in a good or a bad way. What we need to go after is the terrorists and criminals, not anything they touch be it a truck, a knife, the Internet or Bitcoin.
I will go even further: we are in those kind of debates because we live in a society where the discussion is on "what next to regulate or forbid" where we accept that it is acceptable for the Government to regulate every aspect of our life and treat us like children.

Venezuelans are not rioting anymore because they depend on Government for everything and they are busy trying to survive.

Not having Segwit means Lightning loses part of its functionality. For instance you cannot outsource the surveillance of open channels.

If we get to a point with widespread adoption like 3 billion people using it for daily payments Bcash blocks would have to be 1 petabyte. Good luck transmitting it through the network in 10 minutes and only nodes would be few big server farms easy to shut down/manipulate. Lightning is the long term solution. Bcash just takes the boring short term fix (a fix that Bitcoin could always implement anyway if there is no better way).
Plus lightning has many other advantages like instant transactions, smart contracts, and atomic swaps with other cryptocurrencies.
The fact that Lightning protocol uses onion routing increases anonimity massively in Bitcoin.
The fact that you can run a node and earn small fees for allowing transactions incentivises people to actually run BTC nodes acting effectively like a proof of stake.
The thing is Bcash offers nothing extra as compared to Bitcoin. If we reach a cliff after Lightning, Schnorr, merkle trees and other innovations we can always increase the block size. It is easy and boring.

Yeah so optimal that France has 100% debt to GDP, uncontrollable deficits, problems with productivity and double the unemployment than Germany or the UK. And a huge problem of lost competitivity and degrading of the trade balance in recent years.
@_date: 2018-04-28 06:41:52
Well Litecoin is also faster. Dogecoin is also faster. Are they better than Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is the most secure and decentralised coin. Bcash is just another altcoin which has no constraints because does't even have 10% transactions as Bitcoin.
Also Bcash does not have Segwit so great solutions for instant fee-less payments like Lightning would work badly on Bcash.

Well obviously if you buy something and give them your details they know about the purchase. But if you have 1 million in Bitcoin and don't want the government or anyone know if you spend directly through your address where it is stored or send a quantity to another address and then make the purchase with your details they can track you. Instead if you do the purchase through Lightning with several hops they can't track it back.
They will just know you spent $40 and your name and address but will have no way to track it back to your storage address with 1 million.
If you wanted this purchase to be anonymous just go to a physical store that accepts Bitcoin and buy it using Lightning.

I think in the long term minority forks cannot coexist with majority forks. We may find at some point that Bcash hash power is 1% of Bitcoin's. Yes Ver and Bitmain can step in but a bad actor can mine another chain in the background and then issue it provoking a massive reorganisation and caos. And he can short Bcash at the same time. Ver can then move to protect Bcash but the damage is done. And you never know when the next attack is going to be, so unless you just leave there some hashpower permanently while losing money there isn't much you can do.

It doesn't, if you want to have limit orders you need to have the BTC in the exchange. But then you are essentially trading and if you do, I always recommended having it in the exchange.

I just gave you a case: the Silk Road creator.
Or the case of a user who reported his account with an exchange had been blocked because the money he withdrew he used it in online casinos. If you don't mix the coins they can be traced back to you. It is a fact that it is technically feasible, so I don't need to show you more cases.
@_date: 2019-05-23 18:57:07
Wasabi, on top of the coin mixing, has some other privacy features: works only from TOR hiding your IP and has coin control (meaning you know which set of coins have been mixed or where they came from). Other than that the concept is pretty much the same, both are desktop wallets with the pros and cons of desktop wallets.
@_date: 2019-05-05 18:55:54
Same for me
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:48:54
It makes sense to diversify to coins that have different propositions. For instance Monero (total privacy mandatory in every transaction), or Ethereum (more based on smart contracts, a different proposition). 
What does not make sense is to invest in shitcoins that bring nothing new; and currently the market is behaving like that, this is why when Bitcoin goes up then lot of shitcoins follow, because ignorant people invest in "crypto" without realising that if a shitcoin does the same as Bitcoin does but worse and with less security it is destined to die or to lose most of its value.
Investing in cryptos other than Bitcoin is ok, but with some thought on it, not just diversify into every shitcoin in existence! This makes no sense. Is like if a venture capital investor instead of listening to startup's propositions invested in the good and shitty ones just to 'diversify'.
@_date: 2019-05-14 11:26:56
No, it is different is like asking a gardener about quantum physics. He may be good at gardening but have no idea of quantum physics. Buffett is the best at valuing and running businesses, but does not even like technology stocks because he does not understand those companies, let alone Bitcoin. So I don't know why people assume that if you are good in one kind of investment you know about all, and that's not the case. The opinion of any software programmer is worth 1000x more than Buffet's opinion in this topic.
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:16:34
I was thinking, a company such as Amazon could create and pre-mine a Bitcoin-like coin with limited supply and issue it guaranteeing that they will accept it always as payment, the price would skyrocket and their pre-mined coins would suddently be worth milions.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:55:32
Most of the transactions I do is just moving stuff around and I actually don't care if it takes a few hours and I can even wait to do it on weekends when tx go down a bit. I have never overpayed, I think most wallets overpay for what users really need.
I like Wasabi, that does a quick estimation of when is going to confirm so if you don't care you can put a lower fee knowing when lower is too low.
@_date: 2019-05-20 12:32:47
It is a big step forward if Coinbase implements the Lightning network. Also it would give them a competitive advantage vs other exchanges.

Trezor for hardware wallet.
Wasabi if tou want to mix/anonymise your coins.
@_date: 2019-05-14 11:58:33
Why Grin?
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:28:52
Buy Trezor from the official website. It is pretty self explanatory but the website also contains FAQs and everything you need to know.
Just write down the 24 seed words carefully, make 2 copies, store securely. Hardware wallet is the most secure way excluding cold storage ways that require a lot of expertise.
@_date: 2019-05-23 18:48:32
No, in those wallets you hold the key so its yours no matter what. It couldget hacked but that's a different problem, at least not confiscated.
@_date: 2019-05-23 12:46:55
Guys you should start using exchanges only to buy and sell Bitcoin. Do not leave it there. And when you buy and sell do it in small quantities and always from and to the hardware wallet immediately after. If you do it this way whenever they want to confiscate they will just be able to reach a minimal part of your Bitcoin. Leaving all your Bitcoin in an exchange renders the "uncensorable" qualities of Bitcoin useless.
Not your keys not your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:01:42
The creator of Silk Road?
What is a joke? If a Bitcoin account is associated to you then no matter how many transactions it can be traced back to you unless you mix it at some point. That's just a fact.
@_date: 2019-05-23 18:53:07
Same response as above: I used it, it is ok if you look for the security a mobile wallet can offer, but a hardware wallet is much much more secure. It is worth the investment.

The support to SW2X was just to divide the Bitcoin community.

It would be ideal if they accepted Bitcoin directly but the fact that intermediaries allow you to spend Bitcoin in more places increases its value and usability too. So I agree with you, in the end you have purchased a coffee with Bitcoin. 
When you pay in euros in the US an intermediary also converts it to USD, and you say 'I've bought that in euros' and you don't care. Same for Bitcoin.
The true downside I see is that those apps have KYC, whereas if the company accepts for instance Lightning payments you spend Bitcoin like cash, anonymously.
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:19:01
Well it was decided to use EDA algorithm for signatures as opposed to Schnorr because it was under a patent, right?
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:34:49
But in a conceptual manner a coin that has privacy by defect at least has some differentiator. There are some coins that are just pointless, copies of Bitcoin or copies of copies that bring nothing new and I think they will just be obliterated because there is no reason to switch to a less secure network for no upside. That's why some coins have no real volume and will eventually be found out.
@_date: 2019-05-22 11:59:12
It will still be supply capped. In order to issue ETF shares the broker needs to have the equivalent in Bitcoins or otherwise he is bearing the risk. No matter how much exposure or risk wants to bear, he has to buy/sell Bitcoin in order to operate the ETF.
This gives liquidity to Bitcoin and utility as reserve asset. It makes it more legit and more difficult to ban.
In the end of the day the more options there are to use Bitcoin the more utility for any holder. If you think supply will get inflated just don't buy it through ETF but hold real Bitcoins. Nobody can inflate that.

Well he had a vested interest in the previous ipgrade because he was exploiting asicboost. But he has in theory no good reason to oppose those. Schnorr, Taproot, etc. are not controversial for miners. So I expect he will not waste time and energy opposing this.
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:33:46
You can, but it won't be as secure because you will generate the wallet in the computer, which can be compromised. Hardware wallets generate the wallet and sign from within their hardware, which is just meant to do that and thus impossible to hack. Of course you can have Bitcoin in other less secure ways. I mean if you find $80 pricey probably means you are not holding huge quantities anyway, so a mobile wallet should be fine.

No, Robinhood doesn't let you remove it. In fact you are probably not trading Bitcoin but like a derivative, BTC value, a promise by Robinhood that they'll pay the value of whatever BTC says you have with them.

You may want to spend them without having to pay income tax because the system is stupid. So you anonymise them as soon as you exit the exchange so they can't be traced back to you.
