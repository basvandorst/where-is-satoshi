I don't understand comments like this. BTC goes up - 'omg it's unsustainable and needs to crash'; BTC goes down 'omg it's crashing and it's going to die'; BTC stays level 'omg this is so boring and it's going to be overtaken'. What do you people want? It's down 25% from a high of $19500 following a massively co-ordinated pump 'n' dump/troll/media bashing campaign and it's still up from $10500 at the beginning of December... /smh

Download bit address, run it without internet access (or ideally on a brand new machine; there are varying levels of paranoia/security you can run here); generate new paper wallet; either print paper wallet or save it to clean usb stick; log in to block chain and send bitcoin to new address you’ve just generated; put usb stick/print out in a safe place. 
Because your private key hasn’t ever seen the internet, you should be safe (remember to unmount usb stick before you reconnect to internet). You can then add your new address as a ‘watch only’ wallet on blockchain.info. If you want to spend, you copy private key into blockchain, spend whatever, then repeat process (generate new paper wallet etc). 
Might be worthwhile looking into getting a hardware wallet (either Trezor or Ledger Nano S), which keeps your private key entirely offline, so makes spending/sending loads easier and you can restore it if your wallet gets stolen.

So you're saying that the difficulty change+BCH price rise+sudden listing of BCH on Coinbase+Ver on FastMoney+spam transactions on bitcoin+huge social media campaign was a coincidence then? Ok... 
Independent of that, stop putting words in my mouth. How would you know what I think? Bitcoin has problems, of course it does. That doesn't mean that this wasn't an attack and it doesn't mean that there hasn't been massive astroturfing and shilling on pretty much every bitcoin outlet in the last two days and it certainly doesn't mean that everything that's happened the last two days wasn't co-ordinated in some way. 
Last week everything was quiet and then BOOM yesterday happens. You either need to be blind or paid not to see it. Some folk don't want bitcoin to succeed.

@_date: 2017-12-03 18:52:49
You can, but since the privkey is now 'on the internet', it's generally not recommended. Whenever I've done transactions, I've always just moved everything over to a brand new wallet, but ultimately, it kind of depends on how risk-adverse/seeking you are.

Flip side from me a few weeks ago - "I'm not going to lie, all of [the flippening] has got me really spooked, and that's coming from someone who's been in bitcoin since April 2013. So I've been through the goxxing, hearnia, s2x, neo&amp;bee, cloud mining scams and almost everything else, and despite all of that, I've held throughout. But the consistent and relentless attacks from Ver, Wu, the BCH troll army has made me come really close to cashing everything out, and the Dragonslayer shite that's going on just now is nearly the final nail in the coffin. They've got money, they've got outlets, they've got a grudge, and they don't seem to be afraid of throwing it around. So yeah, I have no idea what to do - finger is primed for sending btc to an exchange and waiting for all of this to blow over, if it ever does."
I ended up not selling, but it was a close run thing and I genuinely was ready to stick everything into coinfloor and get rid. I didn't, but that doesn't mean that I'm not still spooked by FUD attempts and more. The way I look at it, though, is if I cash out now I'll lose 20% to CGT and then still only have enough to have nice standard of life, rather than sticking with my original plan of moon or bust. I'm 99% convinced that when 2020 rolls round that I'll open up preev.com and find 1 btc = $100 or worse and I'll have missed my chance, but at that point, I'll just be back exactly where I was in 2013 when I didn't even know about bitcoin.

As far as I can see, the hotel has actually since refunded the 'fine', but it raises serious issues that the hotel could even do this in the first place, without the explicit consent of the credit card holders. Of course, there's a point to be made that the c/c company was able to do a charge back, but it just staggers me that once your details are handed over, they're at the mercy of other people.

No worries - I know how much of a faff it can be, but worth it in the end. If you do sell your BCH, I'd probably just sell it for BTC and add that to your stash, but totally understand that you might prefer to have the cash instead. Bon chance!

So have you managed to separate your BCH and BTC then? If you have, you can use something like hitbtc to sell your BCH for BTC and then cash that BTC out on coinbase. Also, don't use the blockexplorers for checking the price - exchanges have their own prices and that's where you'll be selling.
@_date: 2016-12-21 12:43:04

So yeah, I have no idea what to do - finger is primed for sending btc to an exchange and waiting for all of this to blow over, if it ever does. 
(nb. I was daft and sold all of my BCH for BTC back in mid-August cause I thought it was just going to slide all the way down to irrelevance like BitcoinXT et al. had done, so I don't even have the hedge any more and to buy back-in to equivalent levels of BCH/BTC would involve me losing a fair portion of my btc stash and I'd rather keep my money in fiat than give it to Wu and Ver...).
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:48:16
It really does, it's fucking exhausting. When btc was &lt;$1000, then even large shifts never really fazed me. But now it's nearly $10k, all of a sudden every $100 dollar move scares the shit out of me. The drop last Sunday (after s2x was cancelled) was ridiculous and I don't know if I can go through that again (having already gone through it with mtgox, hearnia, BCH fork and probably countless others I can't remember!). So yeah, after four years of holding I'm really considering calling it a day, which kills me because I got into this not because of the price but because of the tech. If it can be replaced so easily, cryptos have failed in my mind. Man, maybe we need to look into releasing a 8.5mb bitcoin and oust BCH...
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:32:27
I have no idea how you can say a protocol co-opted by a handful of malicious individuals holds to Satoshi's whitepaper concept. If all it takes is a few rich dudes a couple of months to decide how Bitcoin develops, and to change some of the fundamentals against widespread consensus, then the whole concept of cryptocurrencies is dead. At that point, the idea is just as bad as fiat money.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:02:00
The miners should be in it for the money, but they shouldn't be gaming the system like this (and that's purely my opinion). And things are being done - segwit, LN, schnorr etc etc. These things are happening. Sure, maybe they could get rolled out quicker, but then there have been a number of other issues that have been kind of distracting. I wonder how much work went into dealing with s2x and making sure that the network wouldn't crumble, for example. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:46:06
But the point is that AXA don't determine the direction that bitcoin goes or the kinds of things that are coded into the protocol. All commits are evaluated on their technical merit, nor their political clout. If Blockstream/AXA had said 'let's increase blocksize to 8mb', it still wouldn't have gone through.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:23:34
Yes, so much this. Why can't more BCH'rs see this?
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:38:19


Which is a shame, especially since it was meant to be one of the main underpinnings of the entire bitcoin system, at least as far as my reading of the whitepaper goes. From my perspective, BCH never attempted to gain consensus and instead just hijacked the bitcoin name and used it as a way of faking legitimacy. If they were serious about consensus, then any block-size increase should have stood on its own merit - it didn't, not by a long shot, on any number of metrics. Rather than fork off, start again and let the community, users, miners etc decide if it's worth supporting, they're gambling with $120 billion market with the intent of maliciously enriching themselves at the expense of everyone else. What's worse is that people are buying into this while Ver, Wu and others profit from confusion and market manipulation. The fact that they're SWIMMING in money and don't need to resort to these kinds of tactics to have a decent life baffles me, which means that's not about money, but it's about control and power, both of which totally go against the whole idea of bitcoin. The fact that I can even point to key people who control BCH is mad; I genuinely can't do that with bitcoin. 


Maybe, but even though I hope BCH doesn't have any serious future (no developers, will still face scaling problems, is run by really shady characters, more centralised etc), it could stick around long enough to cause some serious damage and undo the progress that bitcoin has made in the last few years, which is exactly what I'm seeing unfurl just now. Just imagine if those who do code and contribute to bitcoin improvements could've just got on with things instead of dealing with all of this drama; we'd be much further along with segwit adoption, LN implementation and proper scaling. But no, instead the community has had to deal with no end of stalling, blocking, recoding, malicious node activity and more. IMO, BCH is the biggest threat that bitcoin has had to deal with, and if BCH wins, it doesn't mean it's the best, it just means it's the camp that's willing to play the dirtiest. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:23:56


That doesn't sound like consensus to me. I thought consensus was about about agreement rather than diktat.
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:16:38
I know I'm thinking long-term here, but that kind of scenario can change, as people start to get trained up in what bitcoin is and take courses on it in university/college etc. In fact, if bitcoin sticks around, I can see financial advisors etc advising people on trading btc, converting it, storing it and so on. Optimistic, I know, but not inconceivable. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:50:51
And it plays on the whole idea of hodling and the benefits of 'getting in early' way more than I've ever seen with 'corporate' BTC stuff (e.g. Blockchain).
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:55:24
It does? I just clicked through to the payments section on the checkout and got paypal and a bunch of card payment options?
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:45:15
Check out the sidebar for suggestions on converting your fiat (£/$/€/etc) into BTC. Most end up buying through an exchange (coinfloor, gemini, coinbase etc), but others buy through local bitcoins (international) or bitbargain (UK only). Alternatively, you can offer your services for bitcoin and get paid directly in BTC. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 18:22:51
It's a fair point, but it's also something which was said at $10, $100, $1000, $2000, $3000 and more. I was buying at near $5k and I'd probably keep buying at $5k and beyond (and I'm sure I'm not the only one).  
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:08:45
Yeah, I'd agree with this as well. The new website updates are pretty slick and it seems as though the BCH crew is stepping up its social media/outreach campaign pretty aggressively. Possible that new people coming into Bitcoin will be convinced by a pretty website and a reasonable sounding narrative.
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:49:32
You're right that $5k is probably some sort of barrier, but the history of bitcoin has shown that those barriers get broken (yes, past history doesn't guarantee future performance etc etc). My way of thinking about it is that whether you buy bitcoin at £1 or £1000 or £3500, you still get the same amount of bitcoin and the same amount of purchasing power (ideally!). Sure, it may go down (and it has done and likely will continue to oscillate), but you still have x amount of bitcoin, and that's not going to change.  
@_date: 2016-05-15 09:08:05

Wait - how do they have access to the privkey? I generated an address with bitgo, sweeped (?) that address into Blockchain.info, and the privkey never saw the blockchain site. Sorry for daft questions, but trying to see what I've missed here.
@_date: 2016-07-06 16:50:04
Ah, that makes sense, thanks. Follow up, if you don't mind? So could it have just been that I imported the address? I'm pretty sure that I didn't send them or upload the private key, cause it's set as a 'watch-only' account.
@_date: 2016-07-06 19:08:14
Ok, that's what I thought, but just wanted to double check! Thanks! 
@_date: 2016-07-06 11:52:03
They don't control the privkey if you import an address in though, right?
@_date: 2013-06-11 22:51:02
Yeah well, colour me unsympathetic. As someone who has jumped through all the hoops of your so-called 'customer service' and received nothing but fob-offs and tough-lucks, I can't say I'm surprised to see more of the same from your company.

@_date: 2013-11-13 21:26:20
Bitbargain is good, although there's usually a steep mark up of around £15/20 (although it's converged on mtgox price just now). 
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:53:00
So, is the USD&gt;BTC conversion rate locked in at the time of putting the money order in, or is it calculated at the time you actually pay? I thought the former, but I'm concerned that it's the latter...
I placed my order last night and just paid about an hour ago, but in that time, the price has increased rather dramatically.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:11:47
This is the exact same thing that happened to me. If the quote is valid for 120 hours, then you should receive the number of BTCs when you pay, not what they're worth at that point. I've just emailed them, but not expecting a reply. I've been added up the three transactions I've made and I've been shorted 0.4BTCs in total. It was only today's transaction that flagged it up for me. It's small change, sure, but it's the principle that counts.
@_date: 2013-04-21 15:32:17
Thankfully, paper wallet is from bitaddress.org, so priv key hasn't seen the net. Going to go check blockchain.info now to see what's what and ill report back. 
@_date: 2013-05-10 16:47:55
It's not so much an expectation, but rather a confusion about the wording of the payment screen, which is ambiguous at best and misleading at worst. I'm glad to see that steps are being taken to resolve this, but if I had known about the variable payment issue, then I would have paid sooner rather than later. As it stands, my thinking on the matter was 'Great, I have a couple of days to go and purchase these coins at the price I was quoted. I'm heading up to the grocery store tomorrow and I'll just get them then, rather than making two trips'. I'm sure I wasn't the only one who got stung by this, and while I'm only out 0.4 btcs between 'buying' and 'paying', it still rankles that I wasn't given the full picture of how the process worked.
@_date: 2013-04-21 14:18:29
That's what I thought as well at first, but it had my wallet identifier, which I can't imagine is public knowledge?

@_date: 2013-05-10 13:03:28
Mmm, this is contrary to what I inferred from the website, when it says that 'this quote is valid for 120 hours'. If it's the case that the price is locked in *when you pay* rather than *when you buy*, that needs to be made *much* clearer. With the volatility of the bitcoin market as it is, more transparency is paramount.
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:45:49
The drop seems to be picking up pace now, but as you say, it's anyone's guess as to where it'll bottom out. My target price is $110 to buy BTCs, although knowing my luck, it'll hit $50 again...
@_date: 2013-08-03 18:09:03
Now what really needs to happen is some sort of dogtag/keychain thing with a (changeable) encrypted private key on it (unless this already exists), so you can use it to sign transactions when you're out and about. I haven't used bitcoin 'in the wild' yet, but my feeling is that it needs to be made easier.

Bank without Borders? (you could also use this as your slogan, since 'bank' can be a verb as well).

Touche.

Ok, so the closest I got was the stream here:
It was either Sarah Mount talking about 'The Internet of Things' or Eleanor Watson talking about 'Market Revolutions'. I've got a feeling it was the one by Eleanor, but the stream doesn't work for me for some reason, so I can't double-check.

I *get* that the price isn't locked in when you generate the quote. Seriously, I do. I even figured it out myself weeks ago. You can even check my posting history to see that. 
My point is that this isn't clear on the website as it currently stands, and it certainly wasn't clear during April when a whole bunch of people jumped into btcs. There is *nothing* that says 'there is no guarantee that the price/btc exchange rate currently quoted will be the price/btc exchange rate you will receive when you make your purchase at location X. We recommend that you pay for your btcs as soon as possible, as we cannot be held responsible for fluctuations in the exchange rate which might affect the amount of btcs you receive'. That's it. Easy, quick and obvious. The fact that there's nothing like this is a massive oversight...
I *get* that you're fixing it, and seriously, that's brilliant, albeit long overdue. And I have contacted bitinstant several times about this issue, and haven't heard anything back about it at all. In fact, I had even forgotten I had posted about this until I got the response mail through. I suppose my question then would be, do you have a policy in place for honouring/refunding the differences in quote/payment prices?

There was also a guy at TEDxBrum at the end of 2011 who did a bit on privacy and bitcoins. Did a bit of research about bitcoins afterwards, but didn't really chase it up properly... I still have sleepless nights :/

Well, of course it can, but as I hope you recognise, that's kind of besides the point. If I bought btcs at their peak, then that's a decision I'm making based on the data available to me at the time; if it goes down, fair enough, I'd have benefited, but please don't try and intimate that this makes everything ok. My overall point still stands; either make it so it's clear on your website that purchases are locked in at the time money changes hands, or lock the prices in when quotes are generated. Whether it goes up or down is irrelevant; the issue here is transparency.
In any event, your company obviously realised that this was an issue because it offered to 'top up' many accounts (although not all, as I can attest to) which had been hit by this exact issue, and as I said, it's good that your company is now taking steps to fix this in future iterations of the website. Unfortunately, a number of us have fallen foul of ambiguous and unclear trading practices, and while I understand the mania that accompanied April, I don't think I'm being unreasonable in asking that this issue be addressed sooner rather than later.

From humanities background, not IT or comp sci, so really, I should be one of the last adopters. In any event, was at a TEDx event last year where one of the presentations was about online privacy, and part of the talk was about Bitcoin. Read a bit about it, but I didn't chase it up as much as I should have. It popped up on my radar (and everyone else's) in April when the price was skyrocketing, and that's when I got in. 
I've been waiting a while for the new 'paradigm-shifting' technological breakthrough, and I'm kind of gambling that this is it. We'll have to wait a few years to see for sure, but I reckon that Bitcoin will be the new way of doing commerce within ten years.

You need five posts and be logged in for at least four hours. As for the authenticator, if you don't have a qr scanner, i'm not sure you can use it, because you have to scan the qr code on the profile page to activate 2-factor.

It's a ratings system, so if they don't sell, their ratings go down, meaning that people will be less likely to buy from them (so kind of like ebay I guess). Buyers also get a rating, so a buyer who backs out of trades once they're initiated gets their rating knocked down, meaning that vendors are less likely to accept their request to buy. 
Once you're signed up (there's some verification stuff you have to go through though. Just remembered...) and you decide you want to buy from a vendor, you basically follow the on-screen prompts and do a bank transfer using your online banking system, sending the money to the account details online. The bitcoins are deposited in your bitbargain account and you transfer these to your wallet (block chain etc). 
All in all, once you're signed up etc, it takes maybe 5-10 minutes to buy coins, and I've never had a trade go bad. I think there's an internal moderation/dispute system which buyers and vendors can use where a trade doesn't go smoothly (either coin or cash isn't delivered), but as I say, it's not something I know much about, having never had to use it.
If you want to sell/cash out, then you can sign up to be a vendor yourself which, as far as I can tell, is a pretty convoluted process, and again, not one I've tried myself.

Never mind, I've just found out that it's the latter... 
Paid $120 for 0.62BTCs yesterday while they were priced at $190 p/btc, but actually ended up getting just under 0.5BTCs at ~$225 p/btc, . It's not a ridiculous amount of money, I know, but still, I'm now short 0.12 BTCs and a) it would've been nice to have a round number of BTCs in my account and b) it says 'quote valid for X', which sounds to me as though the price I was quoted yesterday should have stuck...

Are you thinking of Bebo?
@_date: 2013-05-10 13:05:19
Thankfully, I'm not the one making the decision, but yeah, I like 'Money without borders' as well, although I would guess that's more amenable a link with bitcoin itself than a link with a bitcoin *bank*.

I don't think that a petition will do anything to be honest, especially since most of Westminster will have no idea wth bitcoin is anyway. 
As a Scot in the US, I'm trying to sort out all my BTC purchases over here before I move back home. Not fun thinking about how I'm going to do it in the UK!

After they say 'what's that', what's the next part you tell them? No fees? Digital currency? I'm curious as to what might convince merchants to use it over fiat.

Ha! Just bought our Christmas tree this year from Homebase... If I had known about this, I would have been down there :/
Maybe next year :)

Bitcoin, you confuse the hell out of me. A major funding source is pulled and within 10 minutes, the price is back up to within ~$2 of its mid-afternoon peak... :/

Bitinstant fucks up in customer service shocker! /s
@_date: 2013-05-08 15:39:17
Having gone through a few ways of buying bitcoins, I'd agree that it's definitely a bottle-neck in terms of adoption. Buying $500 a time via bitinstant or setting up a dwolla/mtgox account is a bit of a pain... Faster ways would definitely be a welcome addition.
@_date: 2013-05-10 15:53:29
Yeah, I kind of figured out that's what that meant (albeit after the fact), but my point is that it should be much clearer that the price isn't locked in until you pay. At the moment, it's not clear at all (as many of the complaints have demonstrated), and with the wild fluctuations of the price, especially during April, I think you have a duty of care as merchants to make it obvious to customers that the price they 'buy' bitcoins at isn't necessarily the price that they'll get them for if they wait the full 120 hours to purchase it. It's just sloppy customer relations I'm afraid.

What was the site that had 'panic buy' every time the price moved up and 'panic sell' every time the price moved down? I'd imagine that it's stuck at 'sell' now...

Well, I suppose the allure of Mt Gox is that it's the one exchange which has more publicity around it (good and bad), so people have heard of it, and in a new area like bitcoin, people will tend to gravitate towards the thing that they hear about online and through friends.  
In fact, Mt Gox was the only exchange I'd heard of, and even with all the problems they've had, I didn't know of any alternatives, especially one that had so many people rushing to sign up with them. 
I'm not saying that Mt Gox is the only answer, and there's certainly more than enough space for others, but the fact that it is the biggest means that it will wield more influence, and they could make purchasing btcs a *lot* easier. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:35:37
I would've thought that with a funding source being stopped up, the price would plummet a bit more than it has; but resilience is a good thing I suppose. 
@_date: 2013-05-08 19:30:19
Sign up for Dwolla and MtGox. Find out that they need a driver's license/passport and a utility bill. Realise that all your bills are electronic, so request a paper copy because e-copies don't have addresses on them. Wait five days for bill to be delivered. Scan and send paperwork to Dwolla. Scan and send paperwork to MtGox. Wait 10 days for Dwolla/MtGox to verify paperwork. Deposit money in US bank account. Wait for that to clear. Send money to Dwolla. Wait 4-5 business days for that to clear. Send money to MtGox, wait a day for that to clear. *Then* buy BTCs. 
Yeah, it's really easy! :/
Edit: Didn't know that CampBx didn't need verification, but still MtGox is the biggest, so most people will gravitate towards that, for better or worse.
