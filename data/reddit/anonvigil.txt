Well, are computer security/blockchain analysts investigating stuff?

stinkerb is confused on how those in bitcoin world define "regulations". He thinks that regulations are punishments for crimes.

We don't even know that BFX is legit at this point as communications have ceased. This could be a scam, which means that anything Zane said is just BS.

Bitcoin is about decentralization/distributed systems, where a central authority does not have the keys to the hen-house. It has nothing to do with preventing any form of recompensing right violations such as theft.

I want it investigated.

Well, first you have to understand what Libertarians and Anarcho-capitalists are referring to when they talk about "regulations". A regulation is not acting to punish or recompense a right violation, a regulation is preemptive act to a right violation. A regulation would not be using government to go after a criminal whole stole property, a regulation would be using government to require that every company and consumer fill out paper work or abide by some particular standard of operation.

For the BTC holders... not for those who were at one time going to see no loss, i.e., USD/Alt holders.
@_date: 2016-08-06 14:03:11
Dude, they may not be covering ANY loses, or even covering USD/Alts accounts.

I have money at BFX.
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:36:43
How would one verify that? 
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:26:50
Its hard for me to believe that a story that got international attention by various major news agencies hasn't raised suspicion of governing authorities. 
I am with you though. It seems like there should be more to the story. An article from someone interviewing authorities about the status of the investigation. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:40:18
They haven't stated who they contacted. I'd imagine with all the money that was taken, at least someone has filed a report, but I could be wrong. There are people who had 6-figures in there, probably 7-figures.

There was a crime committed. Either someone from outside stole BTC from BFX, or someone from within BFX stole coins from BFX.

Nothing comes after ASICs except faster ASICs because they are as application specific as you can get.

"from whatever source derived" - means federal government can tax people in China, South America, or from anywhere, i.e., from whatever source derived..
Total bunk... What is the legal definition of a "source"? It can't just mean anything because that would give congress taxing jurisdiction over everyone on the planet earth. so obviously, the term "source" is limited in its scope.

I'm sure he has at least one backup somewhere. Don't you think? 
@_date: 2013-09-28 04:42:27
What are the thoughts on the speed of the transactions... obviously there will be some delay. How is this going to affect trading? So I purchase a share at some price and by the time I receive the share the share price has dropped by 5-10%. Currently I can buy and then sell within a minute or less if I have a bot. We will have to wait 10 minutes to make trades?

I find it strange he would be able to accumulate so many coins, yes. And it makes no sense he hadn't made plans to move somewhere he would have been more protected. I also don't buy that a guy who was an engineer and worth millions of dollars who be trying to arrange the murder of anyone. 
The entire story is a bit outlandish, really. 
@_date: 2013-10-07 00:26:56
No crap!!! That was my point. "whatever source derived" does not mean that congress can tax any monetary gain within the US. There are jurisdictional restrictions on the "income tax" and Congress does not have jurisdiction within the States. The States and the Federal government cannot share jurisdiction over your wages, salary, etc. Its one or the other.

Seems to have done the trick so far. Some of those are exactly the things that many people are looking for in a currency. Buying drugs and avoiding taxes are perfectly legitimate reasons to use Bitcoin. The market for people who want to buy drugs and avoid taxes alone could increase the Bitcoin network and market cap x10. System D is the second largest economy in the world at $10 trillion and it is a market largely built around "underground" business (not necessarily black market), which survives because no taxes or very little are paid on those transactions. 
System D is what we should be going after, not soccer moms and the like. That will come later by default. That crowd isn't going to have any allegiance to any of the liberty oriented aspects of Bitcoin. For example, I know many people who bet on sports, gamble, recreational drugs, etc. who have no idea what Bitcoin is - there is a HUGE untapped market out there. No reason to be forming businesses at this point which aim to compete with existing mainstream institutions. 
Going after the main "dollar" economy is what Clay Christensen would call "Red Ocean", we want "Blue Ocean" and "Disruption". It means we don't compete with the other currencies, we open up new uncontested market space creating a ground swell and only later moving "upstream" to uproot the "dollar" economy, i.e., the soccer moms, the shopping malls, Madison Ave. and the like. 
If having discussions with politicians about Bitcoin and complying with regulations does anything, it buys time, and that is all that needs to be done. By the time the tidal wave approaches it will be too late for them to react.
