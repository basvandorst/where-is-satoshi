This seems as if it's almost the textbook example for unnecessary use of blockchain/crypto technology.

Awesome book. All of his books are interesting and I have little interest in economics/finance.

I really like how this has been posted for about an hour and the relevant legal questions posted have not been answered. *Seems legit.* ส็็็็็็็็็็็็็็็็็็็็็็็็็༼ ຈل͜ຈ༽ส้้้้้้้้้้้้้้้้้้้้้้้

god i hate that show but that pretty much sums up OP!

This would be my suggestion. I'd also suggest explaining it to them as basically as possible. Reminds me of when my grand parents gave me savings bonds as a kid, I had no idea what they were, how to use them or why I couldn't buy toys with them. Expect something similar for your kids. Make it a stocking stuffer or a card on the tree, not a main present. Hopefully they'll want to figure it out with or without you. 
While it's hard to look back to when I was 13 and think about what I would have done with a bitcoin I would either A) spend it as soon as I could or B) put it away and forget about it.

It's actually a funnel.
@_date: 2014-10-31 16:48:29
Have fun explaining that one (hopefully you have cool friends and don't have to).

I live in a great place it's just that the only people that use mass transit, of which we have a very small network in a small city of 50k, are people without cars and apparently bikes. They're usually the ones that are methed or cracked out.

Or his photo is good looking because it's just a picture pulled off the internet that would guarantee matches.

Only chicks on the busses here are meth'd out and looking for money. PASS.
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:41:04
Yeah how about it's far easier to snap a photo and upload on the phone that's running the twitter app? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:20:19
i had a similar thing happen albeit with 10% of your portfolio and was rightly pissed. It was cleared up within a few days but still, their lack of communication onthis and similar issues is disappointing especially when you consider how great their service has been up to this point.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:55:32
What's your plan for the ebikes? Selling complete bikes? Parts to build your own?  Combination?

I buy doge every now and then, it's fun.

@_date: 2017-06-12 18:44:07
Can you let me know what you find out?
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:32:40
That's good to hear and inspiring. Seems you use woocommerce or some woo product for your store, do you recommend it on top of wordpress? 
@_date: 2017-06-18 22:20:50
Yeah obviously, that wasn't my point.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:33:22
backing up important information? who does that?
@_date: 2013-05-19 06:53:21
too. much. work. nice try though.
@_date: 2013-04-25 16:14:39
so you break even, you still make profit afterwards and you contribute to the success of bitcoin, tell me how that is a bad investment?
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:27:20
If you picked up all the dropped coins and bills in the landfills you'd be a millionaire, do you stress about that?
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:49:53
I don't see anything there about registration and I also don't live in CA but I know to register my truck last year it was not cheap. Will this apply?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:37:48
Why not find an individual that would be willing to sell you some directly?
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:13:43
Tek, you're OP on bitcointalk right? I can't seem to reply to your post, but i would like one, paypal.
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:56:18
don't, it's still frozen chain shit. chilis/applebees/red lobster/olive garden/etc... is all shit food. push for your local restaurants to accept bitcoin and frequent them, not only do you support your local economy but you receive a far better product (generally).
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:06:55
how did you lose it? you still have the coins no?
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:56:36
I was at a friends house and was explaining bitcoin to them as they had never heard about it or seen anything about it. I too have spent many many hours reading and learning about bitcoin but I have a difficult time explaining bitcoin in a way that people understand. However, most of these people I talk to are non-technical so even the idea of a public and private key go way beyond their capability.
Even if people understand the decentralized nature of a public global ledger and the abilities the bitcoin network has built in the conversation moves towards user questions and that's where it breaks down. This usually ends with the remark that it's too abstract to comprehend after a question or two. That said, every time I give the speech/spiel/talk I improve upon it which hopefully makes it easier for people to understand.

Hi, were you selling jerky online before or was bitcoin the reason you started the website? How is the site doing? Doesn't look like you have a lot of product (i like a concise product line) so does it take much of your time to fulfill orders? I want to do something similar with an entirely different product and your site looks really simple and nice. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:30:50
who is producing those?
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:39:12
Thanks! Western Colorado... some here *cough* are a little behind the times, even when it comes to selling online and taking credit cards.
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:18:51
I don't seem able to do that either.
@_date: 2013-04-25 16:09:38
I don't know why you're being downvoted for presenting the other side of the... coin but you're right. I think the title should be "Today I bought 10k worth of bitcoins" in which my reply would be... so?
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:10:29
put a zero in front of your decimal.
@_date: 2013-04-25 16:40:59
What WOULD you advise in light of the ASIC situation, seems as if there aren't enough and when there are will it be worth it?
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:47:12
Would you keep this post updated? I'd be interested in this as we have a lot of wineries in the area but not many sell online and those that do definitely don't accept BTC. I'd like to change that if yours goes over well.
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:13:24
Awesome, so is this your part-time job in addition to full-time or are you trying to build this from a hobby to something larger/full-time/employee(s)?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:21:19
Such as what business models? What are these untapped opportunities?
@_date: 2013-04-25 16:23:28
I don't think you mine with it, isn't it more of a front end/controller?
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:32:27
Personally I find with coinbase and a couple of the others it's just as easy to buy bitcoins as it is to use paypal and ebay. Six months, 12 months ago it was less straightforward and easier to buy locally or through a money transfer to an individual.

Maybe this will help.

I suppose I'm still confused as now there are different answers o_O
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:48:03
no debit/credit card.
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:05:00
seems hard to believe that a technology so new that needs new people and minds would charge $400 for 2 days... 
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:00:12
no, how much?
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:17:34
You're right, unless your entire group of friends are involved with more than just surface technology chances are most of them haven't heard of bitcoin. If they have and they're not technologically oriented they don't know anything about it. I don't think you need to be cautious about it, you're right.
Right now I'm trying to figure out a few different store fronts or service exchanges to use with bitcoin. I ask my friends about their opinions and they just say take credit cards.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:45:14
no one is mining in relation to the number of users in or entering the bitcoin world? what do you mean?
