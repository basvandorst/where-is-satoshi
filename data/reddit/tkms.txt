Is that what you call the other several hard forks in bitcoin's history? Is core right now just an altcoin many steps removed from the "real bitcoin codebase" (whatever that is in a decentralized, anti-authoritarian system designed to support such changes)? If no, please revise statement for consistency.

It's a classic example of government creating a problem, then people arguing that *more* government will fix the problem. You've got a problem, no doubt about it, but the pattern is maddening.

Well marriage rights isn't really arguable, however even amongst the most staunch liberty supporters abortion is a huge split. You can make the liberty argument from either side -- it is completely arbitrary and simply depends, inevitably, on your personal preferences. There's nothing more polarizing amongst libertarian types.
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:59:56
Same with Rand on marriage and drugs. His father was better about those. But his father all but said he was an anarchist. He actually directly did say he thought living an anarchist life was a great idea.

And this is why so many of them show up in the Bitcoin community. Bitcoin gives hope for a system of individual, decentralized action in place of state action. Ultimately, we just want to be left alone...

It's only a concern when a party violates the contract and uses the state as a mechanism to enforce the terms outlined for violation or seek damages for it. Any two people can contract between each other without government involvement, and can even settle it in arbitration without government involvement. But in any case, if a government needs be involved, it is only for when the contract is breached and damages are paid.


This is why I want the law abolished. Marriage should not grant any additional "benefits" under the law. All individuals should be treated equally under the law. The comment about aggressive violation of the right to free association is, I suppose, misplaced, since no one is actively trying to prevent people from claiming they are married. If two people claim to be married, and attempting to commit non-aggressive, voluntary acts associated with married people (like signing onto a financial account somewhere as married, which is a matter between them and a private institute), but the federal government intervenes to prevent them from doing so, then it would be aggressive violation.
The third part of your reply there, while I appreciate it for illustrating why people believe this would be better left to the states than to the Federal government to enforce, is less relevant if one wants the law abolished altogether. I suppose having it decided by state would allow states the opportunity to abolish the law independently, which I'd be glad to see, but I still doubt it will happen.
@_date: 2015-05-21 04:59:43
He and I disagree then that it's a states' rights issue. I agree with him more than with other Republicans, sure. I wouldn't merely see a new form of marriage codified into law, nor would I leave it up to states. I would see the law abolished altogether. What free individuals contract voluntarily amongst themselves is no one else's concern, and a voluntary social contract is all marriage is. Exchanging state power for federal power or vice versa only changes who may aggressively violate your rights to free association.
In the second case, no victim no crime. Pretty much covers that. Attempts to kidnap (or, should they resist being kidnapped, kill) those victimizing and aggressing no one else is just that -- kidnapping and murder. Not the right of any state.
I'll just recognize the nice things he's done and still acknowledge where it falls short.

Proponents and representatives of a thing definitely color peoples' perception of that thing who don't have intimate experience beforehand.
I can say, not having had a stake in the game so far, makes me associate the "small block" side of the argument with immaturity, irrationality, force, and tyranny. And he's done that all by himself. Judging by other comments, it looks like I'm far from the only one he's swinging that way all by his own "efforts".

For those who would like further reading, this quote is from Frederic Bastiat's *[Harmonies Economiques]( I believe. Also worth a read, by the same author, is *[The Law](
Bastiat was a great contributor to economic theory, advocate of liberalism and free trade, and opponent the socialism sweeping his home country of France in the mid-1800s. The Law is an accessible and fun read, and I do suggest you peruse it if you get the chance.

What do you think would be the best features of a tool that would be easy to understand and useful for other people in your profession? I think anything that could be done to help keep people out of potentially dangerous working conditions should be done, and people would value that even if they find the profession unsavory.
But then again I have a very libertarian mindset -- other people (outside this sub) may not agree despite the benefits in keeping innocent people safe.

Clearly the rest of the world seems to have a different definition of libertarianism than yours. And please refrain from going the classic route of [No True Scotsman]( on me...
I say this as a full voluntaryist myself -- this kind of semantic pedantry is sanity-draining.
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:02:57
The point is that your very particular definition of "libertarianism" as consisting only of advocacy for an anarchic society is not remotely the only definition, and indeed not even the generally intended definition when the word is used, even if the *ultimate* and most extreme expression of libertarian philosophy is indeed anarchism. This should not be difficult to understand, nor should it be worth harassing others who use it in its generally accepted sense.
@_date: 2015-04-16 23:45:46
It's true, good communication does require agreement on definitions, and people expect that those they're speaking to are using the definitions the rest of the world uses for common English words -- an assumed acceptance of its definition. That doesn't mean you *have* to accept it, but when a word has a generally accepted definition to the rest of the English-speaking world and you simply go around telling people their definition is *just wrong*, when in fact it is the accepted English definition, it isn't helpful at all -- it just makes you look like a pedant and an ass. Hence the reaction.
@_date: 2015-04-16 23:26:15
What makes a word and its definition useful is when it facilitates communication well -- and holding a definition different from the rest of the world's (insisting it's the One True Definition, to boot), is the clear antithesis of good communication. No matter how much you want it to be, your definition is not the definition of the word for anyone but (mostly) you, and it will always be unhelpful as long as you insist on using your own definition while the rest of the world uses the regular and accepted one.
