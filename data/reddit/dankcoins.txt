Agreed. The Market Cap of 21 million coins alone is valuable enough to encourage long-term value increases.  
This is just a blip in the Radar.

Code Academy is great.
But for crypto specific, check out Trading View. It may not be a traditional language, but you can customize trading strategies, and it is pretty user-friendly to pickup for noobs.

You might have to blaze the trail yourself. Maybe there's room for a huge opportunity here?

It is profitable for the miners that remain.   
But, in certain places where electricity costs are higher and they don't have the capital to profit off of current hash rates, some miners may shut down. But, as of now, mining is not an issue.

Long Term - Do Not Panic. BTC has many obstacles to overcome before it becomes more usable and increases in value.  
Short Term - DYOR. There is a lot of misinformation out there. Don't just buy to buy. Be smart, study the market, and only put in what you can afford to stash away or lose.

You could always use Autoview for automated trading. I'm also just testing this from a strategy perspective.

Check out BitMEX.

Exactly. Only Tradingview Pro, plus about $20 a month for an Autoview subscription.  
EOD, you could also just set up manual alerts and use this to help with day trading rather than fully automate it.
