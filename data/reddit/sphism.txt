Yawn. Go watch some documentaries about the fractional reserve banking system

Someone sold too early, butthurt

Hello, i just updated the comment above, seems there's been some more news since the announcement I read.
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:34:56
Well don't sell to some random redditor.
Sign up to an exchange. Transfer coins to your wallet on the exchange. Sell for your preferred currency.
You may need to verify yourself to withdraw usd.
You can earn more on something like local bitcoins but I think that's more risky personally. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:59:44
Haha. If only you knew. Lol.
@_date: 2018-01-26 07:52:01
Don't sell it. You dad held on and you should too. Give it to your kids some day. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 07:55:25
No. It may drop for ages but it's not permanent. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:03:14
You'll regret it
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:55:49
To each their own. Crypto is the future. The current banking system is a con. Enjoy your holdings decreasing over time and I'll enjoy my gains. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:21:27
Never used a Bitcoin ATM. How does it work? Can you buy and sell Bitcoin for fiat? Altcoins too? Do you transfer to an ATM wallet or access your own wallets?

1 US Dollar was worth 1000btc a decade ago. Now 1 usd is worth 0.00001btc
Which is the highly volatile one?
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:24:04
Can someone explain the benefit of using the lightning network instead of just exchanging btc via a different crypto that's fast and free.
@_date: 2019-07-04 06:57:57
Lol. Your entire reality is a lie.
@_date: 2019-07-04 21:29:32
I have no idea what you are talking about, trying the old Gish Gallop?
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:02:22
I doubt they were the first surely satoshi and even other early adopters beat them to it years ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:10:41

Literally everyone outside America understands the SI units.
Bits makes no sense at all and what happens when you need to divide them too. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:22:56
The headlines should read. US dollar plummets in value in last decade from 1000Bitcoin to 0.000234Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:04:48
Well he holds funds in Bitcoin and spends directly from Bitcoin account so yeah that means he's using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:36:01
It's equally misleading as saying Bitcoin has lost X % of its value in the last month or whatever. Since 1btc is still worth 1btc.
If you want to compare btc to usd then let's give it some proper context
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:07:43
Will need to set up dedicated GPU rigs just for memeing Bitcoin.

Reminds me of an anti Monsanto thread I got pulled into argument with some pro Monsanto people who just had to be on the payroll.

Or anything that would allow the FBI to seize your computers and throw you in prison. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 08:38:54
An awesome feature where anyone who downloads the blockchain can be arrested for owning illegal materials. Sounds great. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:34:30
I can't imagine a Professional investor looking at Reddit no. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 05:26:38
Umm. So if you can embed random stuff in the blockchain any government could make Bitcoin illegal by embedding something illegal in it. Then any computer that syncs the blockchain suddenly contains illegal material. Seems like a massive design flaw to me. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 02:39:55
Guess so, if you access to it
@_date: 2017-03-23 02:42:32
true. If someone put a top secret US government document on it then suddenly the FBI can confiscate every single computer with the blockchain on it, the US government could do it themselves... Seems terribly flawed to me but maybe I'm missing something. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 06:06:31
So you want china to abandon Bitcoin and make their own crypto coin? Seems pretty silly to me. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 07:26:47
I just don't really like people turning Bitcoin into a political thing. China could easily retaliate by filling the blockchain with illegal porn and suddenly all western miners are fucked too. Just all seems silly to me. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:34:01
That's exactly what LiteCoin is
@_date: 2018-10-26 19:15:01
Why is that ironic?
@_date: 2016-01-13 06:42:03
If you declare the Bitcoin to irs you would be posting a €600,000 loss for that year. I don't see the problem. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 03:51:02
It's crazy they can use the name Bitcoin in the name. If I sold you 1000 US Dollars Cash for £700 you'd be pretty upset when it turned out USDCash was not USD.

Is that the wall of Grubbs burger on York Pl. ?
@_date: 2019-10-31 00:56:12
Yep I've said this before. Younger generations will say "all you had to do in life was buy 1 bitcoin"
@_date: 2019-10-21 04:13:43
That's great but why on earth would you give a product a biblical name these days?
@_date: 2019-10-05 03:58:40
Move to Portugal. Sell a few coins from time to time. Live a happy life.
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:30:53
Selling a product pretending to be something else is fraud.
The Bitcoin name is inflating the value of bcash by a thousand times.
Like I said. I've never seen another open source project where the fork takes the name. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:16:39
Well I mean the governments do make sales tax on every apple product sold so it's not like it's a bad deal for government.
I think we're pretty close to a situation where large corporations will just threaten governments to exclude their country. Imagine a country's export market if google removed them from search results. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:02:06
The only way a code fork can ever be the original is after being merged back into master... 
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:27:24
Bitcoin looked the same in the past. Look at the underlying technology though. Iota doesn't use a blockchain, it has zero transaction fees, is highly scalable and designed to run on internet-of-things devices.
They've recently signed deals with bosch and Volkswagen.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:19:58
Nice to see some sense in this thread, and not surprised it's from a fellow Iota fan ;)
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:59:08
Of course Bitcoin can be a proper noun.


BCH cannot ever be Bitcoin, Bitcoin will always be Bitcoin, BCH will always be an alt coin based on Bitcoin. It may be better, it may be worse, it may be more valuable, or less valuable. But it cannot possibly ever be Bitcoin.
And YES, BCH are deliberately trying to trick people into buying BCH thinking it's Bitcoin: 


No i'm not. Bitcoin is Bitcoin, just as I am sphism and you are GayloRen.


A fork by it's definition is not the original, if it were the original it would be a commit, not a fork.


It's not an opinion I don't like, it's people being conned out of their life savings by con-men.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:58:23
The rate of supply is slowing down so the value naturally increases. (I think that's the idea anyway)
Once the mining is finished then all bitcoins will exist. No new ones will ever be created. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:45:24
2033 is the endpoint on this chart:
And 2017 looks like an inflection point on that chart too, where the gradient switches from more up to more sideways... What that means i have no idea... :)
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:01:44
You'd love Iota then. No transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:29:01
Fair enough. I think of it differently to you.
Back in 2010 the rate of production was high, flooding the market with cheap product. The rate of production decreases as the rate of people wanting the product increases so the value increases. If the rate of production were linear the rate of increase in value would be less.
But I'm happy for you to see things slightly differently. Have a great day. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:11:02
Bitcon would be a better name for it
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:33:54
Sure but that's irrelevant. No one owns the word water but if I sold you water+ that was rats piss it would be fraudulent. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:26:58
Yep, totally agree. And introducing a new cryptonoodlecoin and calling it Bitcoin+ definitely makes people think it's bitcoin and definitely fits the definition of fraud
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:25:15
I've never seen another open source project where a fork takes the original project name. It's definitely fraudulent to sell something with Bitcoin in the name that isn't Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:03:49
The rate of increase is slowing down so the demand goes up
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:30:01
For all those who think that bitcoin not being a trademarked brand has anything to do with fraud, here's the definition:
- wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain.
- a person or thing intended to deceive others, typically by unjustifiably claiming or being credited with accomplishments or qualities.
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:42:17
Oh right yeah. Ha.
Iota is the perfect technology for electric cars to pay batteries for power. So I think that's why car manufacturers are keep.
The car can just pay the battery directly. Machine to machine.
Because the transactions cost zero and the network gets faster the more it's used you can have proper micro payments.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:29:03
You misspelt Iota in the title ;)
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:14:51
Yes for each transaction you send you must verify 2 transactions. So the cost is in processing 2 transactions. Which is a tiny cost if you pay for the power. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:56:42
I believe the sole reason for Bitcoin cash using the term Bitcoin is to mislead people into thinking it is Bitcoin, which it is not. 
In that way I see it as fraudulent. I don't think it makes any difference if Bitcoin is trademarked or owned by anyone.
You are referring to Bitcoin as if it means Cryptocurrency. It does not.
Btc and bch are both cryptocurrencies but they are not both Bitcoin.
People will buy bch thinking it is btc.
I don't know why people in this thread keep mentioning whether or not Bitcoin is a trademark. It makes no difference to fraud. If you pay someone money expecting to receive cannabis but you receive coriander then you are the victim of fraud. Neither cannibis nor coriander are trademarks.
Bcash is coriander :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:18:24
It's insane that any alt coin is allowed to have the word bitcoin in it. If i made a new currency called United States Dollars Cash and sold it to you for less than a dollar you'd be pretty annoyed to find out it's not actually US$
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:00:59


That i agree with.


I'm trying to understand your side but I don't get it.
SO let's say that there is constant demand, no new people buying bitcoin, just the same people wanting to buy the same number of coins each day.
If the rate of supply drops to a tiny fraction, let's say 1BTC per day. Then you're saying that won't affect the price?
Or if the supply suddenly jumps up to a billion a day, that won't affect price either? (i'm aware there's only about 21M BTC but you get my point)
Or are you saying that the difference in production supply gets naturally balanced out by people selling existing supply? What about all the coins that simple aren't up for sale?


You could probably explain your position better with that diagram
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:13:21
But you're assuming that all bitcoin in existence is available to buy. But it's not. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:53:10
You say


I say


Seems like we are saying the same thing
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:30:42
We are still in the mining phase. Once that's done it will stabilise. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 09:30:21
Pity that bitnz just got shut down. I think all nz banks refused to give them an account to trade Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-07-15 21:59:25
Britcoin was a Bitcoin exchange back around 2012
@_date: 2016-07-16 06:39:01
The price doubled last month, is that not good enough?
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:51:06
Ouch. Even a small tip in 2011 could be worth tens of thousands of dollars today. But you are amongst friends. We have all lost heaps in hindsight.
