I first found out Bitcoin in January when price was around $1040. I bought my first 0.50BTC @ $1040. Then I bought few more as price kept on dropping. So my current average price is $780. I'm still in red but not as bad if I would have bought all of them at $1000. 
I would suggest you buy some more (if you have extra cash) at these lower prices to lower the cost basis per coin. Just my 2 satoshi's.

I created 7 BIP38 encrypted paper wallets using Bitaddress website offline. I loaded "one" of the wallets with some coins and added that wallet as "Watch Only" on blockchain. Here are some questions:
1. If I import my private key and Passphrase on blockchain to sweep those coins, does that mean remaining 6 wallets are also compromised since they used the same "passphrase"? Keeping in mind that remaining "six" addresses have never been entered online yet.
2. When adding address as "watch only", are my coins sitting on block chain or are they still on my paper wallet?
Thanks Moronic Monday!

Bypass the paywall. 


Add  Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff to the latter category. Rogoff, in an article inThe Guardian, writes that bitcoin, which hit a new one-month high today, and other cryptocurrencies will become less popular with speculators as governments take steps to rein in and regulate them.






Most experts agree that the ingenious technology behind virtual currencies may have broad applications for cybersecurity, which currently poses one of the biggest challenges to the stability of the global financial system. For many developers, the goal of achieving a cheaper, more secure payments mechanism has supplanted bitcoin’s ambition of replacing dollars.
That said, he calls it "folly" to believe that bitcoin will ever be allowed to take the place of money issued by central banks, as this would make taxation and cracking down on criminal activity extremely difficult.

@_date: 2015-10-05 23:06:59
answered this question in another thread. Here is the question and answer:


To me it seems an inferior offering, at least off the bat, because of lack of initial liquidity (a problem all exchanges face) and extremely high fees (25bps for both sides, which will certainly exacerbate the lack of initial liquidity)


Coinbase and a Gemini comparison is an apples to oranges exercise. Gemini Trust Company, LLC, a New York state limited liability trust company, which makes us a **fiduciary**, and allows us to accept both individual and institutional customers under New York Banking Law (unlike the BitLicense, which does not convey such fiduciary powers). In other words, **Institutions can be comfortable that we have the highest level of capitalization and regulatory policies, and can rely on us acting as a fiduciary (i.e., to protect their interests first and foremost)**. Coinbase is applying for a Bitlicense which does not convey such powers. Wto itBit, we are both going after a very large market that is to date completely underserved or not even in Bitcoin at all. I think its a good thing that there are multiple efforts trying to build bitcoin infrastructure (including Coinbase) so that we can get this thing to the moon. No single points of failure, lots of tunnels, bridges and onramps...onward and upward!

There is approval system on Coinbase. The more identification you provide to Coinbase he higher approval you get. 
For example, I'm on Level 3 and I can buy $100 worth Bitcoins Instantly. Anything over $100 takes 5 days. Now If I give more proof to Coinbase then I can get bumped up to Level 2 and I can buy $1000 BTC a day and so on.

There is 1% fee on Coinbase and they do the lock the rate at time of purchase. I have been using Coinbase for 1 year. Other than waiting 5 days for your coins to be delivered and 1% fee, I have no complaints.

The article did not say he minted 90,000 worth bitcoins. They said he minted 90,000 physical bitcoins and he charged $50 for each coin he minted. So 90,000 coins x $50 = $4.5 Million.

While reading this article the bitcoin price dropped 2.1% in matter in few minutes. Be very clear on what you are doing and what are the pro's and cons. Write down all the worst case scenarios that could happen in case bitcoin goes down 50-70% and how will you mitigate those risks. Just my 0.02BTC.
