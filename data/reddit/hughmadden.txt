Hiya Hegemon,
fortunately I've never seen our marketing team send a CC all :) or anything similar so we've never seen anything to suggest anyone's emails from our accounts are in the wild.
The brute force attacks I see constantly are hitting us with lots of invalid email addresses which would indicate it's an external database being randomly applied against all exchanges.
(i.e. a leak of our customers email addresses would generally result in the attack using mostly valid email addresses).
If you can send me your account email that would be useful,
@_date: 2015-12-18 00:50:44
No our db hasnt been leaked :)
We are however seeing a constantt barrage of login attempts with some someone trying to brute force user accounts. I imagine this is standard fare for all exchanges.
If you are using a unique hard to guess password for each site you will be fine. 
Even better, use tfa.

I'm the CTO and co-founder of ANX. I've used LRoS several times - very convenient, no hassles encountered, rocking good product :)
ps: i've never met the team and have no relationship, just a happy user

I'll hold off integrating a little longer then. Multisig please!

As an engineer who has used and benefited from bitpay open source contributions I feel a bit defensive against those stone throwers without a single line of code contributed to the public domain.
Put your own dollars and time into contributions to the ecosystem and then you may have a leg to stand on.
Disclosure: no relationship to bitpay. Never even met the guys just worked with their open source code.

I see the Ethereum hardships as gaining product maturity.
It is a lot more complex than Bitcoin and hence will take longer to mature in stochastic terms. (Permutations of state, inputs and outputs).
I continue to see Ethereum as a significant piece of technology. I also continue to believe it will take longer to mature than most people expect.
This battle hardening is hard to replicate in closed ecosystems.
It isn't ready for the prime time yet; but a few more of these iterations and it might be off training wheels.
Give it a few years..

well done team @ BCI , great work to attract such a senior adviser to your team.

Each actor has a different amount of influence, constantly shifting. Where is the centre of gravity between these actors? I'm not arrogant enough to think I know, it's as complex as an economy. All I know is I -don't- know.
So when you say rethink? rethink what? All i believe is that all of the actors are important, and nobody truly understands the science as to what makes "consensus" given those forces.
I'm am sick to death of people in this community shoving their views down other peoples throats however.

Someone might want to check if that is simply the offshore renmimbi exchange rate, which differs from the onshore exchange rates used for actual remittence.
For the interested:
Basically usd buys less cny outside of china.
If WU is quoting offshore rates but actually settling at onshore rates they are killing it.
Disclaimer: too busy to check if this is what they are actually doing, just a hunch.

I tend to agree that the entities controlling key domains, such as Bitcoin.com, Bitcoin.org, and the PPA repository, are powerful forces not typically discussed in these conversations.

ANX is quite a large business with probably a dozen different phone numbers.
I assume you are talking specifically about our retail Bitcoin product, which has face to face customer service and email.
Have you by any chance ever visited our offices?
@_date: 2016-02-16 10:04:34
do you mean is the pay rate fixed to a fiat currency or stipulated in Bitcoins?
we would have to fix the rate in a fiat currency i'm afraid, which i understand is the practice for all companies that pay in salaries in Bitcoins.
are there any companies anywhere the pay salaries as a fixed amount in Bitcoin ?

our hiring manager is out for the day so the formal JD will be sent via PM tomorrow, assuming she is back then.

I've tried to stay balanced, as I believe the best course of action inevitably falls somewhere in the middle.
However the community is so polarised if you venture any opinion at all, it will be sucked immediately to one extreme or the other.
This along with the absolute pain suffered by one running a busy set of secure wallets sans segwit means this ecosystem is broken.
We are our own worst enemy, the flipenning isn't happening because of external forces.

we have a lot of support staff, but never enough it seems, we are hiring in all parts of the business.
support can always be better and is a critical success factor to any business.
other than that I'm not going to comment as I see my support colleagues working very very hard - support in a Bitcoin business might be one of the harder jobs on the planet ;)

The thing that makes Bitcoin beautiful is it's application of both technology and economic forces.
Most of the hard core Bitcoiners are great engineers but perhaps a little less inclined towards the humanities, but under a facade of logic, economics is about individuals and their motivations.
A positive characteristic of engineers is the ability to accept cold hard logic and adjust world views. So listen up.
Perhaps we as a community should take a more positive approach to solving the rift?
Instead of cold denial and attack, recognise that fully half of the elegance of Bitcoin derives from individual actor motivations.
Now rethink and present positive solutions. Remember Bitcoin doesn't work despite people. It works because of people. It's the judo of technology, it works by redirecting individual incentives towards the good of the system.
People proclaim satoshis vision blah blah but so far I haven't seen either side of the rift reproducing his brilliance in marrying incentives and technology.

Thanks for bringing to my attention the typo on that release. The marketing team erroneously stated we will not support the s2x hard fork in the near term. 
In summary:
We will support one or both chains at our discretion based on the outcomes of the forks and network stability and function.
To be clear the miners and developers complete lack of co-operation is making it very hard to operate any sort of an exchange business. 
ANX will turn all BTC services off for an extended outage.
When there are signs of some stability we will examine the situation from the perspective of hash rate, stability, economic activity and support one or both of the chains.
General commentary:
The wonder that is Bitcoin is an elegant combination of forces, with actors ranging from users, miners, developers, businesses, and others.
For some time two of those forces (developers and miners) have been at an impasse, struggling to find an equilibrium of power.
It's my view that this is finally coming to a head, and in the short term it's going to be very disruptive to users and businesses in the ecosystem.
From a purely personal view (not an official ANX view); I have lost a lot of respect for the BTC ecosystem over this last year due to the large amounts of FUD on every forum. Ridiculous conspiracy theories everywhere, emotional discussions on every forum.
The only "truth" of the matter is that both core developers and miners are significant and powerful forces within BTC, and right now this is coming to a head.
Is Bitcoin defined by the hash rate? Or by the development community? 
If the hashrate goes to s2x, is that therefore Bitcoin? If the core devs do a POW change, rendering ASICs useless, is that new chain still Bitcoin with a different POW?
I don't know - but it's clear to me that the core development community and the miners are not acting purely in the best interests of Bitcoin. A collaborative and aligned dev+mining community would see us at a much higher market cap.
TLDR; ANX will support one or both chains, after an extended outage to monitor the situation.

Very intelligent design. Amazing work.
Please keep it up bitpay!
@_date: 2017-05-31 04:33:48
speaking purely for myself, I just want segwit.
the current fee and full block situation causes busy businesses such as anx, and our customers enormous pain. 
i would sign up to any group that appears to have a chance of reaching majority concensus among miners, economic majority, and the ecosystem of core developers. 
Conspiracy theories abound, but most of us (end users and businesses serving those end users) simply want our beloved network to start working again.

So first, disclaimer, these guys are before my time and I'm Australian, I know nothing about American history or politics.
The guy right in front looks like the dodgiest guy of them all. Obviously laughing at somebody's expense right? Benjamin Bud.
Well according to the following url, he was a brave  producer of documentaries, perhaps most famous for exposing propaganda and in relation to Vietnam. 
Not prima facie exemplary of the joke?
Now if we look to the extreme right, we see a gentleman much more deserving of a cypherpunk discussion.
"Ronald Reagan campaigned for President in 1980 on a platform of slashing government spending and fiscal responsibility. Instead, under the guidance of his treasury secretary James Baker, he created the debt-dominated capitalism which is unraveling today."
He should be front and center!
Sometimes the truth is more interesting than fiction. Please expand / correct anyone more knowledgeable.
For example the gentleman on the left past Reagan was Walter Cronkite, and this photo was in the oval office proceeding Walter's last interview of Reagan before retiring. Obviously not too tense of a grilling!
Just past Walter we see Brady who was permanently disabled by a gun shot wound during the Reagan attempted assassination.

*sigh* let's just admit it. We (all stakeholders) fscked up. Dev community, users, miners, businesses, 'nebulous economic majority'. We rested on our laurels in the name of conservative approach​ / wealth preservation.
For someone with a background in institutional financial services it's deja vu. Once you have a system of significant value supporting an ecosystem with something to lose, you lose your agility and are vulnerable to innovation.
Bitcoin you have turned into a legacy bank.
Stop pointing fingers and think critically about what's next.
