Funny thing is, Eminem isn't even the one who says it. Lemme guess, MGK fan?
@_date: 2018-05-22 04:54:27
Too volatile, which is unfortunate. If they don't even have faith in bitcoin, why would anybody else.
@_date: 2019-03-18 21:27:57
But....is a sign really considered adoption? ��
@_date: 2019-03-29 20:59:33
But you're into crypto. Banks are your arch enemy.
@_date: 2019-03-26 03:54:05
Bingo. He probably did that also to take heat off himself. So people wouldn't pin everything on him. He was deathly afraid of the IRS/SEC smacking down on him.
@_date: 2019-03-16 08:40:48
Lol yea. That was always a good one.
@_date: 2019-03-22 05:24:31
Wait, hold up. Is this true? Lol...
@_date: 2019-03-19 05:52:19
This is a copypasta...right?...
@_date: 2019-03-19 07:58:18
Well then, thank you for that extremely detailed and clear response ��
@_date: 2019-03-25 20:11:10
But the theory is that he was too sick to continue at that point and essentially "retired". Makes sense if you think about it. I truly believe he was Satoshi.
@_date: 2019-03-23 20:23:50
In 2011, some guy online gave me 15 BTC to post comments on his website... Those are long gone lol.
@_date: 2019-03-25 20:09:02
I always thought this as well. But the only drawback I can think of is why his wife wouldn't have access to these coins. They were worth billions at one point. I wonder if he left her a separate wallet to use and told her not to touch the other wallet in order to not crash BTC. I guess we'll never know.
@_date: 2019-03-18 02:46:29
I just checked this person's account and apparently I'm blocked... Wonder what i did lol ����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-06-01 02:57:36
@_date: 2019-06-12 07:23:56
It's only like a year away.
@_date: 2019-06-03 17:29:05
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:12:46
We've been sideways for a year and a half...
@_date: 2019-04-13 17:03:03
But isn't Roger called "Bitcoin Jesus"? Lol
@_date: 2019-04-09 21:22:35
Oh shit. I thought I was early in 2011. E-gold was like 2001?
@_date: 2019-04-30 18:30:29
Not my bitch...
@_date: 2019-04-17 17:19:01
I believe it's a copy of an old Bayer ad.
@_date: 2019-04-13 18:43:09
It's probably like $250
@_date: 2019-04-30 02:17:07
Exactly lol
@_date: 2019-04-26 09:28:39
Oh lawd
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:02:28
Ok ����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-04-11 03:03:11
Oops, you're right. "Unstoppable" is more common lol. I still believe BTC is 100% stoppable, in the United States at least. The govt can do whatever they want and you know that. Doesn't mean I agree with it
@_date: 2019-04-30 01:09:38
I spent all of mine on a road made of a fine, strong, soft, lustrous fabric.
@_date: 2019-04-30 01:08:00
Mine is my bitch ex-wife (she talked me out of buying BTC in 2011)
@_date: 2019-04-30 18:31:39
Holy shit. I think that's worse than my story...
@_date: 2019-04-30 02:17:45
You're damn right. She was ***one*** of my 99 problems.
@_date: 2019-04-13 17:01:23
I've always believed that Hal was the real Satoshi due to the way in which he exited the crypto space (and other details such as first successful transaction, etc). Hal was too sick to continue working and then all of a sudden Satoshi disappears forever. Coincidence? Now as far as Dave's role, I believe he just mined btc.
@_date: 2019-04-08 21:14:39
I found BTC when it was $7 and l watched it crash back down to $1. So that scared me off. I guess that was my luck in bad timing.
@_date: 2019-04-09 11:03:29
I honestly thought they were collecting trash lol. Like some sort of community service.
@_date: 2019-04-09 10:51:58
Dude in the picture is down $15k
@_date: 2019-04-09 10:54:30
But how does *buying* bitcoin solve that lol? To buy anything, you have to have the "resources" in the first place...
@_date: 2019-04-09 12:39:40
Lol how do you know what I do and don't do? I am on a crypto sub after all...
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:40:16
Unless...Bitcoin price tanks overnight lol. And now you are silently poor but via whales dumping, instead of inflation.
@_date: 2019-04-09 11:01:12
By buying bitcoin ����‍♂️. That'll show em!!!
@_date: 2018-07-10 01:21:10
Thanks! I thought the green thing was a coin.
@_date: 2018-07-10 01:03:00
That's pretty awesome! I wonder what it says on the left sticker.
@_date: 2019-05-11 02:21:46
So true!
@_date: 2019-05-28 03:35:22
Nice maths
@_date: 2019-05-11 02:16:41
Not in 2017
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:05:38
You mean the memes?
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:02:43
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:06:02
Still waiting on payment
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:03:44
Only thing that annoys me is most of the other coins aren't following the trend. (I own more than just BTC)
@_date: 2019-05-04 22:55:26
@_date: 2019-05-07 01:55:34
I've gotten so many messages and chat requests it isn't even funny.
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:04:51
It's CB Pro, mister. Get it right!!!
@_date: 2019-05-04 23:02:28
Title literally says "at red lights"
@_date: 2019-05-15 08:14:35
I'm not getting the same results.
@_date: 2019-05-28 22:00:43
I'm 34 but I don't remember that one ��
@_date: 2019-05-28 03:37:32
Reminds me of newgrounds, that old flash/shockwave game site.
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:32:28
Yessssss! Even higher now ��
@_date: 2019-05-04 22:57:26
Don't demean people or think you're better than anyone. It's not very nice.
@_date: 2019-05-09 16:43:24
Wait.. It ended?
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:19:31
Lol good fucking luck, buddy!
@_date: 2019-05-11 02:22:48
My wallet says otherwise ��
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:13:28
XRP isn't for some reason... Biased much?
Edit; lol haters
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:33:14
Tell that to my 2017 self.
@_date: 2019-05-05 18:00:30
How do you *make* sit ups?
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:06:14
I wonder if he actually owns any coins lol
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:18:04
This is awesome! Thank you for recognizing the real Satoshi!
@_date: 2019-05-05 18:02:40
What a cheap gimmick to get free advertising for your site... That's in over a year and a half.
