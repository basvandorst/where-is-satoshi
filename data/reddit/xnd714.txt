These idiots go and add as many people as they can - just smashing the connect button to random profiles all day.
Then they brag that they're connected to 50,000+ people as if that actually means anything.

I feel like a lot of people in this sub making claims about the financial system haven't taken an intro macro economics course lol

Oh I see, that clears it up thank you. I assumed the public key was also involved in receiving transactions.

I feel like they've been doing a pretty good job of that on their own.

From a technical perspective, you basically need to obtain the private key to that address to recover your 5 bitcoin. 
Theoretically you can try guessing, but it'll basically be like flipping 256 coins and waiting until you land heads 256 times in a row. It would actually take trillions and trillions of years. 
Its estimated that around 20-30% of all bitcoin in circulation are sealed away forever, because the private keys to those addresses are lost.
Edit: Oops I forgot to mention that you also need the public key of that bitcoin address. So take the  256 coins from the example above and do it twice.
That's the double edged sword of a decentralized financial system. There is no recourse or central authority you can call to get your money back.

How would you be able to get that single bitcoin into your address without ever revealing your public key? Surely that 1 btc had to some from somewhere.

Yeah you know, fundamentals like Price to earnings ratio, cash flow from continuing operations, etc.
Just kidding, It's all bullshit lol. I believe in btc but to claim that the fundamentals are pointing up doesn't even make sense to me.
