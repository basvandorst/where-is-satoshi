Yup, you were right, a perfect storm happened, j didn't think it'd go a low as it did.  And I think it could still go lower, gdax has recovered a lot but with 300k unconfirmed transactions, this is going to jump around sub $15k for a little while.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:15:34

I get what you're saying but I just don't think we are there yet.  Everyone has this feeling at the moment $12k is cheap, $10k is a steal, so they'll eat it up if it happens.  Unless some huge whale attempts a sell off which could blip at $10k momentarily before people get back in.  It could happen though I suppose but it'd be behind the guise of the institutional investors, they're testing the market with money right now, seeing how the market reacts to different scenarios before futures happen.

Coinbase would likely permanently ban you for attempting any shenanigans on their system.  You'll be fine, you have like 0.05 btc and it'll be worth more next week than it is now, if you don't like that, sell it and then use that money to re-enter the market.

eh, thsi is reddit, a liberal hive of scum and villainy
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:00:13
Reddit crypto communities aren't brainy enough for that kind of discussion.  It's all about ATH prices, memes and attacking/complaining about flavor of the month crypto.  You mention exchange withdrawals being a big reason for unconfirmed transactions, I think it's actually deposits could be.  With the prices where they are, I think a lot of people are thinking to cash out.  Moving coin from their offline wallet to exchanges to cash out.  Of course, we don't know for sure but all these new users coming into crypto probably aren't transferring off exchanges yet, that'll come down the line once they actually figure this thing out - or don't lol.

@_date: 2017-11-29 15:57:04
Ah okay, yea I don't see a lot of Jaxx love but I think it's useful for a small balance.  I know in their docs they say not to use it for mining, I believe that is just because mining payments can come in quite often on some pools - however that's not really the case if you're using Nicehash because you can control when you get a payout so you can do like 1x a month bulk payout.
I have Jaxx, Electrum, Exchange and Hardware wallets.  Just don't get yourself confused and keep all info on hand.  Also, make sure you know the recovery procedures. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:50:22
Yea, that's usually for people who can't verify, etc on an exchange so thats why they pay a premium.  It's high risk for someone to sell 1 bitcoin for cash (or credit) on the street.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:36:29
Hopefully it knocked their socks off
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:31:42
Yup, it's effect would reverberate across many exchanges and cryptos because maybe people buy BTC with tether but they exchange it for ETH, BTC, LTC, etc.  At the end of the day though, how much Tether is there? 600,000,000 in a market cap of 230,000,000,000 would lead to a dip and some disenfranchisement but things would continue just like they did after China or any of the other problems cryptos have had in the last 9 years.

Were Mt. Gox accounts insured in anyway?  I suspect not since it was even more of a wild wild west back then.  There are at least exchanges out there now that are insured, USD accounts FDIC insured and other insurers against a big hack like that.

With many crypto the only way to get them is by using BTC exchange, if BTC is inflated, then the other cryptos are inflated the same if not more.

Its risky, of course all of this is risk but you have a chance to earn some extra money by selling high and then buying dips.  Around the time of the segwit2x and the bcash meltdown was primetime for this.  Market is bullish right now and I don't think it's a good idea to be trying to buy dips, today for instance the dips were only around $50-200 max.  Segwit/BCH dips were $500-1000.

Yea, part of the reason bitcoin is soaring is there is no reason to hold money with your bank account making 0.005% interest.

I don't think it will go as low as it did last time.  There were a lot of weak hands in the market back then that were flushed out.

He said if there is a sale, like 50% on the toothpaste or any consumable, stockpile 2 year supply because you'll end up buying it every couple weeks at full price for the next 2 years, overpaying in the process.
