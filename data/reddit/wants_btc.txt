Yeah see that's actually the point of this post, I'm trying to find another place to take my business to.

you're a cunt.
And I didn't call them assholes with the hope that it would change their mind, I called them that because I believed what they told me, that my transaction was actually cancelled, and that their algorithm appears to **take six days** to tell me that, an affect of the fact that they're inconsiderate assholes.

I don't really have an issue with coinbase, but I find you and ablegenta patronizing when you lecture me for calling a spade a spade. Not everyone curses out of anger, that's just how I talk. When I got mad was when you two assholes chimed in. Don't take that too personally.

They didn't give me any hints to there being a secret menu wherein you email them back and they "investigate." If that's how they run things they should be upfront with it and not tell me that my transaction is cancelled and I have to wait a few weeks to try again. I shouldn't have to find out how a business runs its business by "researching" information from third parties.

I did call them assholes for waiting a week to tell me that, we'll see if it helps.  I've yet to find a btc "payment processor" that isn't horrendously unprofessional and unreliable. 
EDIT: Thanks for this tip. Though I had replied this before reading your post, "Fuck off. Why wait a week to tell me that, assholes?"
They reply: "Thank you for submitting your request. We have received your request and are working on responding to you as soon as possible. If you have any additional information to add to this case, please reply to this email.
Thanks in advance for your patience and support."
Fucking secret menus.

What unrealistic expectations? That if a company promises to do something on a certain date in exchange for sensitive bank information, that they'll actually do it? And that if they cancel it at the last minute, they'll give me an actual reason?

Yeah, because I cared about being right in an argument, not because I have a real issue w/coinbase. Despite my temp username while locked out of making posts on my other acct, that's more important to me than getting bitcoins is.


I also don't bask in my own benevolence when I give people tips online. 


I don't call people a cunt to their face irl (very often) because there are more consequences. But I want to make a point. My reason for calling him a cunt was that he chastised me for calling people assholes.
