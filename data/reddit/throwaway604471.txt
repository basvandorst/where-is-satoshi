n-thing yes. This is a good idea.

Watch me. I'd buy 10K just for the nostalgia value. And some more to spend on pizzas.

We might be standing on a precipice but we're about to take a great step forward

Never, ever tell anyone you have Bitcoin, seriously. Unless you know they have about as much as you do.
Nobody wants to hear someone else got rich. But they're happy to be sympathetic if you lost money.
I told some friends years ago but now I lie to them that I lost them all and I'm sad.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:31:04
Then I'll buy some more. There's only a few million of the things and plenty of nerds who want some.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:23:36
It's even worse.
If you rearrange the letters in SATOSHI NAKAMOTO you get...
A SATANIST HOMO, OK
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:29:27
Because it's good for everyone who owns btc if you lose *yours*.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:06:34
Maybe they'll try but the thing is it won't work. And it's not all the big guys. I know many ordinary people putting in their money, people who don't really understand cryptos.
Every time the big guys try shaking the tree by pumping and dumping, it gives the rest of us a psychological lesson to ***HODL***. All we see is that long term greed is best served by not selling. Bitcoin is resistant to that kind of strategy because it's so deflationary. If you want a seat at the table in a decade you want to own coins right now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:25:20
How's this different from people putting money into gold?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:04:16
Like someone else said, if it really is more than you're comfortable putting in right now, probably best to sell to someone who's happier holding than you are. Don't expect me to take my own advice though
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:58:44
This sounds a bit hyperbolic but it's basically true. There has been a collapse in confidence of nearly all American institutions. I think lack of trust in government and finance is surely driving people to seek to put money elsewhere even as a "fuck you".
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:08:46
Lol, I know. It makes absolutely zero rational sense, but I feel just the same way. Given the amount on my wallet at present I wouldn't have bought that with dollars if someone put a gun to my head, but since it's there already I'm just meh about it.
I figure it's all about loss aversion. If you don't feel you've lost anything if it all goes down, you can be cool with an absurd amount of nominal wealth in crypto fluctuating wildly.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:08:08
I don't think it should be. It shouldn't matter should it?
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:54:21
Give it to me, I'll make sure nobody else gets hold of it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:25:26
Famine in Africa isn't that common, a bigger issue is investment in rural communities. I can see benefits for people in poor countries from a global, frictionless and inflation-proof currency. It's not a miracle, just a better transmission belt for labor and value.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:21:43
Holy shit. So this is my question: would you have invested 75% right now if you had the same money?
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:24:04
Did she have sex with you to get you to stop talking about bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:17:19
Okay then, I don't want to pay taxes for when you get sick or for your kids to attend school. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:24:39


Wait, *what*
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:02:20
You're boned.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:22:29
It totally does :-)
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:01:40
Literally never.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:26:26
The company? Bit ambitious.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:24:16
All I can say is I'd buy the fuck out of $1 bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:20:54


Wait, what
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:09:47
You have absolutely no cash or stocks? Wow.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:54:01
BACK TO 300 BUCKS
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:11:51
I've *lost* millions. I'm a negative millionaire.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:14:23
It's kind of amazing to contemplate there are people whose problem with Bitcoin is it just isn't volatile enough.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:22:38
Here's the answer to your problems: 
Don't tell anyone about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:10:20
An oxymoron, a quality shitpost. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:54:32
Can I interest you in some tulips instead?
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:30:25
All the people saying it's going to be a nonevent are making me think it really is going to be a huge crash.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:34:33
True but there's a chance you could end up livestreaming one of the most important financial events of the year.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:35:47
It's more convenient to buy and sell BTC than a gold bar. Not that this is the only comparison one could make.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:20:30
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:11:43
It's a sort of Pascal's Wager. I don't have that much money but I could afford to lose 30%. On the other hand, it *could* end up a life changing amount if btc goes up more.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:03:04
Everyone who asks this question should actually sell and stay sold so they stop clogging up /new/
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:48:59
K, enjoy your third world existence
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:43:51
You realize you just asked for the value of a new car?!
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:13:50
Yes. Everyone thinks this, but hasn't sold their bitcoins because they just want to lose money.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:56:01
SODL :)

Someone PLEASE record this song...
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:35:35
I can't call shit. I've never claimed to. If I knew what was going to happen I'd be rich, not working a menial job.
