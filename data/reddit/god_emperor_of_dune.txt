Lol no it's not. Segwit became the compromise after segwit2x was introduced.

Ah yes. When I first started using Bitcoin I wanted it to directly compare to Visa.

Or maybe dissenters are banned and an echo chamber has been created here?

All I can do is upvote.

Unless big blocks work like we think it will.

More like his post will be deleted and he'll be banned from participating in this sub. I'm sure we'll find out.

I think everyone with an actual technical argument gets banned. With that said I'd say about 90% of the people on both subs would struggle to explain what a blockchain is.

You're glad that governments are killing competition. 
BTC holders aren't what they used to be.
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:18:37
Because third world countries have benevolent governments? Governments tend to tyranny - always. If you haven't learned that yet then you need to grow up.
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:28:11
Not even close to that high of a number. And regardless - the government has no business telling me where I can spend my money.

Look up the real story. They got fucked by one email the creator sent that essentially admitted guilt. There was something bigger that could have leap frogged us ahead in technology by years if it was allowed to be rampant. It's now taking the form of blockchain. 
I don't think you can stop what's coming.

This is a hilariously naive statement.
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:56:03
What the hell does that even mean? Seriously. That makes zero sense.

Very, the libertarian, is "from the central banks". Sure.
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:28:58
It's always been BS. Core backers are not cypherpunks.

Innovation =/= exploit.

Anyone that doesn't agree with me is a shill!!!

You mean letting the free market work as intended? We don't do that here in Bitcoin.

Every April when I submit my taxes? Analogy for you would be when your parents file you as a deduction on their taxes.
Using the strawman of third world countries doesn't make your lack of an argument any stronger.
