I think your understanding of nodes may be wrong but correct me if im wrong. From my understanding all miners are nodes but not all nodes are miners. In fact, all participants on the bitcoin network are nodes. There are degrees among the participants; some just make transactions, some verify new blocks (by checking if their hash is within the correct range), and relay them to other nodes, these are full-nodes, while others create new blocks with new transactions doing the PoW, these are full-nodes + miners.

I am saying that addresses making transactions can be rightfully called nodes. Its another thing that they cant verify transactions, they are still nodes on the Bitcoin network.

Even a wallet client making transactions is a node so you saying that nodes just check validity of incoming blocks is wrong. A user just creating transactions via wallet is also a node but it does not do verification.

Hey thanks for the answer. That clears things up. So, the transactions that are yet to be mined are all correct? The only task the pow achieves is so that the network agrees upon the correct i.e. longest blockchain thereby making tampering older blocks infeasible?

Thanks a ton for the answer. I have a little better understanding now. So when a mined block is propagated along with it's hash, the other nodes also check if the transactions are called i.e. the accounts actually had the money they transferred and the private keys behind them initiated those transfers? Can you please link to a resource on this matter so I can read in detail? Thanks!

I genuinely chuckled at this
