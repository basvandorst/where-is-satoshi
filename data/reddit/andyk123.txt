Only if you hide your money in your mattress, put it in a savings account, or use a CD. The stock market is very accessible even if you don't have much money. I've invested about $2k/yr and have been getting about 7% returns. Granted, I'd be doing much better if I put it all on bitcoin at the start, but I still stand by my decision to use Schwab

"Outside of Zimbabwe, fiat has less volatility than bitcoin"

Your comment assumes everyone with money only spends it on things that never appreciate in value or buries it in their backyard though.

How do they all trend downwards? I have an extremely modest portfolio that has been outpacing inflation by about 5%

Yeah, but the fees aren't going to the dirty fiat-loving banks

Maybe. I'd consider gold a semi volatile investment, like any commodity. Even if you put your money under the mattress, it'll still be "worth something" any time down the road (at least, I believe). Just not as much.
It's just the world we live in. If you're not doing something very productive with your money (or anything you own, really), don't expect to get anything for free.

Yeah, the reason Germany failed was purely because of their currency. There were no other factors at work. They didn't have massive war debts from WW1 or anything that might have contributed. It was only the random volatility of fiat inflation.

8% annualized returns is pretty average for a professional investor over the long term, and that's after they take their fees and whatnot. Take a look at the DJIA or S&amp;P. Sure, money can get "wiped out in a week" in a large crash, but that is really only a big factor if you are day trading, which I'm not.

It's not regulation that has held back innovation. Cc companies have balked at the startup cost to upgrade

True. It's not controlled by anyone. But fiat isn't controlled by shadowy people either

Yeah. The Canadian dollar took a pretty big hit in the early 00s iirc. But I personally don't believe that automatically makes bitcoin superior
