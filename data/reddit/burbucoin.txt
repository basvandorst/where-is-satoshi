It's not a bug on chart. I bought at 5.100€ from this crazy flash crash.

Yep. Look at me, I'm the stable coin now.

Report it! Scroll down and click on flag icon from Play Store bitcoin.com main page. Unacceptable, supplanted and scam.

I catch it! I'm the man. I will pay $50 for each Nigerian monkey right now.

Why we need to use the FiAT pattern? If you want to buy an ice-cream with Bitcoin it doesn't matter. I think is more simple satoshis and bitcoins only.

Has a € or $ or ¥ their own Twitter account?

In this period, FIAT loses something like a 90% its value from BTC pairing. Well done.

Buggy wallet too, as always.

Dude, USD is a shitcoin. Pay a reward on BTC, like a boss...
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:18:57
Lol. Only 3 cryptos. I mean, come on. Sure they have a lot of traffic, but Polo have a bunch, dozens of shitcoins. Trading today BTC/USDT and taking some profits with any problem.
