Mine not confused on how this all works at all.


It's just extra data added to the seed data, call it whatever you want. I asked the simple question of whether you can still store your 3 seeds from the multisig setup insecurely if you use a secure(!) passphrase on each seed. Think by now I've figured for myself the answers is yes. Someone with access to all seeds won't be able to access your bitcoins if they don't also know your passphrases.


It's an excellent definition.
@_date: 2019-11-05 16:59:44
I could do that, or I could just link you this so you can find out how wrong you are:
@_date: 2019-11-03 20:23:27
You've lost the plot.
@_date: 2019-11-03 18:22:55
The passphrase is a 25th word to the 24-word seed. Having access to all seeds gives access to the bitcoin. Having a passphrase for each seed (that is not physically stored) negates that. Right?
@_date: 2019-11-04 18:29:56


Is this still true if using a passphrase (25th seed word, not passcode) on each Trezor?
@_date: 2019-11-06 17:01:29
It's the commonly implemented BIP39 standard:
* [Trezor](
* [Ledger](
* [Coldcard](
* [GitHub](
Now look at the OP and the comment thread you are replying to. It's all about hardware wallets. Don't come into my house and tell me how to speak. I'm done with you now, you fucking troll.
@_date: 2019-11-03 17:56:08
I'm asking whether I can use a passphrase (25th word) on each Trezor. Such that, each Trezor won't work for the multisig wallet unless the passphrase is entered.
@_date: 2019-11-05 16:57:07
No, that's wrong. You don't understand how a passphrase works.
@_date: 2019-11-04 18:29:19


This is incorrect, that's your passcode. The passphrase acts as a 25th word to your seed. If you have a secure(!) passphrase, you can give out your seed to anyone and they will not be able to access your bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-11-04 18:40:00
No, different addresses and privkeys are generated based on the passphrase used.
@_date: 2019-11-03 20:28:27
This only deals with setup of Multi-Sig, not secure backup of the seeds. I don't believe Multi-Sig is secure without seed backups.
@_date: 2019-11-04 18:52:19
You don't seem to understand how a passphrase works. A passphrase can be anything. It could be '1230d0asjdadm!!!!//sdsd/as.da"?!?!!" or any variation of that- every variation would generate an entirely different set of private keys.
@_date: 2019-11-04 20:08:15
Not that gibberish that I just fatfingered on my keyboard, but a memorable-and-secure passphrase, sure.

That's wrong, he is referring to WWII. The Franco-Prussian war happened in the nineteenth century, but he talks of the easy government money of the twentieth century.
@_date: 2019-10-11 20:59:54
How does that back Saifedean's claims? If anything it refutes them and states WWII was not financed through inflation.


So taxation and borrowing, not inflation. 
Why is Saifedean's book full of these attempts to reframe history to make it fit his narrative? It's a shame really, could have been a great book if he would have just stuck to the facts. Now I would not recommend it to others.
@_date: 2019-08-25 08:00:24
I have installed the testflight beta and opened a channel with Zap, and so has a friend. Now when we try to send each other a payment we get “unable to find route/unable to find path to destination”. How come? I thought it might be an inbound capacity problem, so I made a payment to Yalls. Still doesn’t work.
@_date: 2019-10-04 09:49:36


Wrong. Multiple times, every day. Getting 1 sat/b transactions through should take days in a proper fee environment with sufficient fee pressure to incentivize miners.


Yes, make them 300K as [described here]( It's not crippling, it's ensuring miners continue to secure the network. Removing that incentive by having low block rewards and low fees is what actually cripples the network.
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:17:06
These sources seem to contradict Saifedean's narrative. He writes:




This implies the Africans used beads as hard money before the Europeans arrived. This is written as if beads were already present in West Africa and Europeans exploited this by **starting** to reproduce these beads in Europe. However, online sources write this part as Europeans having brought the beads to Africa in the first place and using them for trade there, as they **were already being used** for trade in Europe:




Now, it might not matter as the exploitation effect on the Africans was the same. It does, however, paint a different picture about the intent of the Europeans. What I gather from the online sources, Europeans simply spread their trade to Africa and used beads for trade as they did at home. Then noticed they were being valued, and brought more. This is different from basically *forging* beads that were only valued in West Africa in the first place. It appears Saifedean writes this nuance to fit the anti-inflation narrative.
@_date: 2019-10-04 09:53:03


100% agree. Now we need to define the right 'small'. I'm saying 2MB does not even fit in that definition. 1MB is where 'small' might start. &lt;500K is the 'right' small.
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:36:37
So you concur that the Europeans brought the beads to West Africa in the first place as Africans had no way to make them? The best source I found through your links is:  which vaguely states the beads are from Benin in 15th century, but also states their origin is disputed.
I guess it's close enough to fit the narrative. I'm just curious what sources Saifedean used to base this passage on.
@_date: 2019-10-05 13:07:41


Definitely not.

IBD will take too long.
@_date: 2019-10-04 07:36:05
The mempool gets emptied at times. Not all blocks are full. This isn't a fee market. Only with a never-empty mempool can there be a stable long-term fee market. We need smaller blocks for this.
@_date: 2019-10-04 12:12:53
Keep this tab open for a while and check from time to time, you'll see blocks that aren't full (indicating an empty mempool) regularly.
Transactions at 1 sat/b *should* take days in an environment where fees are sufficiently reimbursing the miners for their work. If 1 sat/b transactions are regularly getting cleared, then fees are nowhere near sufficient to replace the current block reward. That, or bitcoin has to be something like $10 000 000/coin.
Miners are *currently* sufficiently incentivised, but might not remain so when the block reward drops and fees remain low due to large blockspace. They have not stopped, because there is a block reward. This will not always be the case. I hope you know this, as make an argument about the future of bitcoin based on its current incentive state makes no sense.
@_date: 2019-10-04 07:30:44
SegWit is great. LN is great. The fact that it was also a blocksize increase is not.
@_date: 2019-10-05 13:06:43
How do we know what price at what reward level is good enough?
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:17:15
See my other reply in this thread.
@_date: 2019-10-04 07:33:51


This is nonsensical. If block rewards drop, people won't suddenly start paying more, miners will simply turn off unprofitable machines. This reduces the security of the network. If fees are to take over the block reward, they should already be a significant portion of the miner's reward.
As it is now, some blocks are mined half-full or even empty-ish because the mempool is empty. Without sufficient block reward- miners simply won't bother to mine until there are fees. The current situation therefore is unacceptable. The mempool should never be empty. With blocks 1mb or smaller we might achieve this now.

Pay $300/year, get back $1/week. "Incentive scheme". 
Look, the Casa Node is a great product and the company is undoubtedly doing great things for bitcoin adoption. However, it would be great if you could stop this bullshit and vague marketing and make your platform more open. Make it clear on your website that the node is purchasable without a subscription to other services. Don't force users into using the Sats app- make it easy for them to connect any LN wallet. Don't force them into using the Keymaster app- make it easy for them to connect any hardware wallet to their own node. Don't be Apple.
@_date: 2019-10-04 12:13:45
See some of my other comments in this thread, they pretty much cover my arguments w.r.t. small blocks.
@_date: 2019-09-13 12:05:54
Could you elaborate on how dynDNS defeats the point of TOR? I have some basic network knowledge, but not enough to grasp this.
@_date: 2019-09-22 07:52:09
Which ports *should* be listened on locally if **not** running over clearnet?
What can I search for in a LN explorer to find my node?
@_date: 2019-09-11 18:11:12
According to [this]( I need a VPS to run the EPS. Yet *another* thing you need and pay for. Is this correct?
So for a layman to **just** use their own node with a hardware wallet, they need to go through all that. I mean, come on. If I run bitcoin core on my laptop I can use it with a Trezor directly right? Why isn't that possible through the Raspiblitz interface?
Edit: according to [this]( I don't need to get a VPS and just need to install some additional things on the Pi. Which is correct?
Edit2: but... connecting Zap to the node from outside home network requires DynamicDNS setup:


To do so you can register at an DynamicDomain service like freedns.afraid.org and forward the TCP ports ...
@_date: 2019-09-21 17:48:46


So LN peers pass around info on payment channels, i.e. the network topology, while bitcoin peers pass around transactions and blocks?


So they see public key and no other IP info? By public key, are we talking wallet public key or LN node public key?


Should I take from this that running LND over Tor is undesirable/risky/cumbersome?
I know it's a bunch of stupid questions, bear with me, thanks.
@_date: 2019-09-21 13:33:22
Is this possible on iOS?
@_date: 2019-09-22 07:35:14


Thanks. Do you know how I can check whether my Raspiblitz is running exclusively behind Tor or is also available over clearnet?
@_date: 2019-09-13 08:34:55
Thanks. Can I follow the separate Electrum Personal Server guide by RaspiBolt if I followed the initial Raspiblitz setup?
@_date: 2019-09-13 19:37:48
Thanks, will do.
You have Zap on iOS through tor?
@_date: 2019-09-22 07:41:35
Interesting, my RTL interface only shows clearnet peers (I think). I would expect to be connected to some Tor peers if I'm running over Tor.
@_date: 2019-09-13 12:46:28
I see.
Are most people opting to not use TOR and publicly exposing their IP? Do you know more on the risks of exposing the IP of your LN node? It seems like doing anything bitcoin related while exposing your IP is like advertising with a big ***BITCOINS HERE*** sign.
Also, is it possible to run your bitcoin node over TOR but not your LN node for easy setup with Zap? Getting my node parts in a few days so thinking about how to set it up.
Ideally it's Bitcoin over TOR, LN over TOR, EPS to connect HW to the node and iOS Zap to connect to LN node from outside local network. It doesn't seem that's all possible however.

Great one! I'll start donating the first 10-50.000 sats whenever I open a channel to generate some inbound capacity while helping to keep the ecosystem's developers well-coffeed-up!
@_date: 2019-09-11 17:38:03
You're right the whole setup doesn't seem very streamlined yet. 
W.r.t. using Trezor/Coldcard: how come I can't just use that with the node directly? I would like to do it without Electrum. Will this be possible in the future? Can I run an Electrum Personal Server on the same node?
Also, am I right in seeing that the cost (as per the updated Raspiblitz shopping list) of running a node basically doubled recently?

By gossip, what information do you mean exactly?


Thanks, so my peers see a .onion address instead of IP:port? 
Also, why is it important that a peer node is able to re-establish a connection to specifically my node in case of a disconnect? Right now I'm connected to a couple other peers (this was done automatically, I didn't do anything for that), so why should I care if connection drops and I connect to others?
Still trying to get my head around what function these random peers perform.
@_date: 2019-09-13 19:40:45
This would involve switching to the home VPN every time I want use Zap right? Not ideal.
@_date: 2019-09-13 12:07:12
@_date: 2019-09-22 08:03:02
I have localhost listening on port 9735, but also another 13 other listeners on various other ports. All I did was setup Raspiblitz.
I'm not quite sure I follow. I should look for my loopback address e.g. here:  to see what information is public about my node?
@_date: 2019-09-13 19:39:44
So I should run a hidden service on the pi (Raspiblitz/bolt) as well to make this work?
@_date: 2019-09-13 13:33:28


We'll see how far I make it :)
