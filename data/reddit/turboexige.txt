Gonna be hard to dump with the mempool being as clogged as it is. I agree though, any capitol to buy more bitcoin cash is def gonna be Christmas come early.

Suppression is the last ditch effort of people scared of the truth. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:50:46
Stop using bitcoin is how you can help because it's only for the rich apparently. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:49:23
Use Bitcoin Cash

"When BTC is pumping all is organic but when higher utility coins do it its all artificial."
You people are pretty funny...
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:53:24
What are you gonna wager against BCH still being here 7 days from now?
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:19:24

Funny you should mention a growing tumor *cough*mempool*cough*
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:22:58
If people are able to push fees up this high because of failure to scale short term your coin is broken. But keep on worshiping it and thinking the world is against you. The only people to blame are the blockstream devs.

I dont think tears are good for 1mb nodes. Better waterproof them.

The creator of litecoin just sold all his litecoin for fiat rofl. Good luck with that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:14:23
Lol it's doing such a great job right now...Blockstreamcoin is a fucking joke.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:38:35
Rip.

RemindMe! 1 week 
Wanna make a bet on it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:20:07
Lol everything but the actual cause of failure is an "attack" according to this sub. Y'all are delusional 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:31:33
18 months* tm
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:25:39
Wait for it to be dropped from the mempool. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:42:39
Trying to find someone to take over it's legacy?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:25:31
Need less sodium in your life man.

If you are gonna call someone an idiot, don't make yourself out to be one in the same sentence. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:55:12
I BET THAT'S THE ACTUAL GUY.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:21:38
Who's we? Are what are you contributing to Bitcoin's future other than rooting for its price to go up while its usability tanks?
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:08:55
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:05:57
Sound investment strategy. You are truly an economic mastermind.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:05:26
Because it goes against Blockstream's business model 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:54:26
There are almost 300,000 transactions stuck in the mempool. Use a better coin.
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:27:21
Is the old slow broken printer they are dragging him away from supposed to be core or? I don't get it.
@_date: 2017-04-02 12:06:39
Updated to the new script.
@_date: 2017-04-02 14:12:36
or 
@_date: 2017-04-02 12:02:53
@_date: 2017-04-02 14:37:22
Does the white color function not work?
@_date: 2017-04-02 15:40:24
I modified the art in 's script.
@_date: 2017-04-02 16:04:36
I mean the offset can be moved wherever. Everyone running the script will have to be on the same offset though otherwise it will be counter productive. 
I figured the other logos would get eaten by the rest of @_date: 2017-04-02 16:18:18
I mean running a script kinda makes infighting a moot point and its also way more efficient. I was just suggesting.  
@_date: 2017-04-02 16:10:36
If we can get everyone running this script in a tab in the background it would be very easy to keep up 
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:52:30
Does not matter to me I just made it outta bordem
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:47:01
if you want you can incorporate this
@_date: 2017-04-02 12:02:03
Should make one for  as well. Zero cooldown.
@_date: 2017-04-02 16:14:36
To use this:
"Full credit to Usage:
go to and press F12
click console at the top right
paste in all that code and hit enter
Then you can just leave the tab open and it will automatically preserve the "BITCOIN" word.
Advanced users:
Add the script to tampermonkey so that it loads after a page reload. Also use this to auto-reload your page so it doesn't get stale.
Reminder that alt accounts work too."
@_date: 2017-04-02 16:13:13
Check it out. The more people we have running the script the easier it will be to maintain.
@_date: 2017-04-02 14:06:03
@_date: 2017-04-02 11:25:56
Someone should edit the autoplace script to work with this.
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:53:23
Actually hold off I messed up lol lemme fix it
