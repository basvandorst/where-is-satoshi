It's just a correction, you can't expect it to go up so much and not see a retrace. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:12:15
Nobody had banned anything you idiot, you are literally spreading FUD
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:37:07
What i said was not in hindsight, it was obvious from the start it was not a ban.  You started the post by saying 'So another ban eh?', what on earth made you think Korea would ban crypto?? Even the thought that they would ban crypto shows a lack of intelligence/understanding of the crypto market.  Like i said you are literally the reason people get worried because you are spreading complete bullshit.

Coming soon
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:48:12
Just out of interest how many bitcoin do you have? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:20:58
No hold, but more now
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:31:52
Why you mad though? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:16:09
With toxic posts like this I'm pretty sure the community doesn't like you either
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:11:00
I think coinbase might be having slight issues today, give it a bit longer. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:17:43
I'm not the person you originally replied to, im just curious as to why you would want someone to get 'bitten in the ass'? It seems alot of people are jealous and really want bitcoin to fail so they are not kicking themselves in 5 years. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:09:29
How long are old addresses valid for? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:22:59
Lol your post history is pure cancer, I'm guessing you sold at 10k right :) 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:16:15
Don't be bitter and jealous, it will eat you up. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:02:44
I'm too scared to click on your link sorry 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:58:51
Jealousy and bitterness will eat you up op, it's not too late to buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:10:21
thank you, so after a certain amount of time the bitcoin will return to the senders wallet, do you know what sort of time frame?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:40:07
Yeah i think maintenance 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:52:22
As long as it's not 13k or lower I'll sleep sound. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:18:14
Why is it nice to see? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:22:28
Let him sell, he will only lose money in the longterm. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:06:10
Any source for that info? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:30:26
Datadash also said the price would drop significantly when futures started last week. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:53:14
Maybe litecoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:19:52
Google transaction accelerator 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:11:36
When you say MASSIVE correction, what sort of price level are you speculating? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:26:01
Interesting, im guessing you'd rather i purchased some bcash? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:49:10
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:10:09
Yes they work
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:02:41
ETH is the daddy? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:40:49
To begin with you have quoted something i didn't even say, do you know how quotations work?
Secondly you clearly don't know the definition of arrogant or condescending because i have been neither.  You are the one being condescending by saying 'I really do hope you are young.. if not, you have no hope'.  
You say 'It frustrates me people are taking such a huge risk without realising such risk'  but you then say ' I can't wait for this to bite you on the ass', that is nothing but a childish spiteful comment, you are obviously bitter that people with possibly less knowledge than yourself about bitcoin might make money from it.
You like everyone else have no idea about the 'upcoming state' of bitcoin so stop being so arrogant and opinionated.
So my question still stands,  why you mad though?
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:12:03
i dont really need the bitcoin on coinbase anymore and would rather it was just back on my nano, how would i go about sending it again?
@_date: 2018-05-25 10:28:09
Maybe 50 a week then another 50 in more traditional savings. Don't put all your eggs in one basket
@_date: 2018-05-15 15:05:01
Didn't they announce a even bigger loss the day before 911 but one of the planes that hit the pentagon also destroyed all the evidence....
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:15:19
Wow good luck op i hope you find riches! 
@_date: 2019-04-27 23:28:56
Nice simple sticker, i wonder where he got it from, i want one for my car.
@_date: 2019-04-02 10:19:16
I agree it's just another trap but shorts were only 20k, they were higher last month, 4 months ago they were at 42k. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 13:37:09
You've been able to leverage short for years
