But is always possible that in future is happening a state or company that has temporary ability to not care about profit because want to control BTC.  Because of this is important for BTC not be depending on only profit seeking miners.  
Is same like to leak bad informations about the company you have own.  Is very bad profit in short time.  But after you buy and have control then is very good profit.  Also very good power over world currency BTC.
Why control?  Maybe because want to have own of total BTC.  Maybe because want to make BTC zero value.  This very good for fiat.  Maybe do this because watch so many films of James Bond.

Also this make me very afraid.  Who is become happy if happen hard fork and is same person able to make being "more optimal conditions" is what I am wonder.

Not on first day.  But yes after some time.  This is more reason why I think BU is not right decision.  Because is adding 2 way of making more centralization.  Already there be one way.  Then we add big blocksize way.  And nodes going to BU way.  So BU can do anythings.

True, okay!  But now is only true in one way.  If I am understand correct then BU is open new way for this is happen because at this moment is everyone use BC for nodes.  So nodes to reject anythings not correct.  
This meaning that if Doctor No is want to fork bitcoin he can do but no one else is use his fork.
But maybe I don't understand in total.  Is so much for understanding.  Please telling me what I say is not correct and I will learn.

Oh.  Then why everyone being sad because of fork?  Fork 5 times.  I own 5^2 coins!
@_date: 2017-02-06 12:35:23
Core matter, okay!  Because Core is nodes.  Nodes have power to say no to anythings mining do.
Reddit don't matter, okay.  Sad face.
@_date: 2017-02-06 11:44:18
This tell me two things.  Nodes have much power.  And maybe I am learning Bitcoin!

I am begin agree.  Actually I am think soft fork segwit is bad idea.  Also I am think BU hard fork is bad idea.  But segwit hard fork is good idea.  I think?
What are the reason why hard fork with segwit is bad idea?

I do not have this trust.  I see too many time people trust and lose everythings.
@_date: 2017-02-06 11:22:47
I am sorry but I am not understanding this.  Maybe is 100% correct but you have many words I am not understanding very much.
But I think problem is not in situation now.  Problem with BU is because is creates new game.  And because of new game is possible in future to have state or company or Doctor No make control of BTC.  
You are correct is not possible today, okay!  Probably I agree.  Probably everyone agree.  But if BU happen then it become possible other day.  If it become possible then Doctor No decide trying it.  Maybe one year.  Maybe 25 year.

This is so important was to explain!  I think if more people are knowing this then there is being less argumenting.
I want be very specific (sorry for the English) about what is so good.


This!  I was not understanding this before now when I read you.  For so many weeks I am thinking BU is perfect solution and why people are being so hard to change is because people no like change or no like China (BU).
But now I see is bigger problem.
Please say very loud from tall roof this way to explain!

Everything I read tell me this not possible.  Must use command line python tools for TREZOR because myTrezor.com not supported by TOR and Electrum not supporting wipe TREZOR.  I am have LONG conversations with TREZOR and Electrum supports.  Here is what is necessary from email I get from TREZOR support:
Instructions for python tools
First, please run these installation commands:
sudo apt-get install python-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev
sudo pip install --upgrade setuptools
sudo pip install hidapi
sudo pip install trezor
Then continue with the command: trezorctl reset_device --h (to list all available options). Typing only: trezorctl reset_device will start initialization process, but without PIN and Passphrase setup.
There's no written manual I would know of, but here are simple explanations.
-t it allows you to set number of recovery seed words used for initialization (either 12, 18 or 24, default setting is 24 words - we highly recommend to use default option)
-p enabling PIN protection
-r enabling passphrase protection
-l setting up the label of your TREZOR device
This means you should be fine if you execute the command - trezorctl reset_device -p
Parameter -p is for enabling PIN protection (as mentioned in our instructions before), where you can set your PIN. It's very important to understand how PIN Matrix works. Please refer to this video: 
In your case, you will see in the terminal set of numbers in fixed order and on your TREZOR display the same numbers but with a shuffled position. You will choose the number combination on your display and then retype their position by numbers you see on the terminal. After this, you will be asked to write down your recovery seed. For more information about PIN, Passhprase and Recovery seed please follow this link - 
For using Electrum and TREZOR you maybe want search my other messages.  I am just figure this out!

Ah, yes.  Call with '--help.  Why you didn't say this before?  Manual is better but this is okay.
Link to satoshilabs is terrible advise.  No information there for trezord.  Only stupid options that are not for TOR or are for smartphone.
@_date: 2016-12-09 02:37:57
Can you explain this?  Sounds good but I cannot understand.
Also, why you say "forget mixing" and prefer other?  Is mixing not good?
@_date: 2016-11-29 09:02:17
Um, can you explain?  Nothing here is make sense to me.  What is Fungability and what is monero?
If is better, maybe write private message.
Also how is mixing to "forget mixing?"  Is mixing not good?  Why?

Thank you for your replying.  But Tails Linux is not good for me.  For me, is easy to adjust settings for Electrum to using TOR.  
What I am interested in about your replying is what does this means?  "you may need Google Chrome to initialise the Trezor."
How can I inititialise the Trezor?  Maybe if I can do this I can use how I want.  At this moment I only see stupid "Go to mytrezor.com" and don't know how I can get rid.
@_date: 2016-10-14 09:37:06
Support people at Trezor say I do need trezord if I use Electrum.
And this make sense because when I try Electrum and put Trezor in USB, I only see Trezor say "Go to mytrezor.com" and nothing more.
@_date: 2016-10-18 11:40:30
Do you have manual for trezorctl?  I am trying trezorctl and seeing "optional arguments" but I do not understand Trezor.  What can Trezor do?  What must I do if I am using Trezor?  I need manual or maybe something else?
