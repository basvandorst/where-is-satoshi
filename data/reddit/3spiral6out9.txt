His gripe is with Facebook not crypto.

Read through all the useful idiots comments in response to the wall being built, their REEEE is hilarious!!  The cognitive dissonance is sad though, don’t be like them.

You are in dire need of psychological help for your TDS.

Now you just need to realize his “lies” are just part of his amazing negotiating skills.  The art of the deal.

This is the level of intelligence those who truly hate Trump have.  They are the type of people that gave birth to the NPC meme.
@_date: 2019-07-12 20:14:39
You are projecting
@_date: 2019-07-13 01:03:37
You don’t know what projection is, obviously.  I’m studying useful idiots like yourself.  Carry on...

LOL, the wall is being built as I type.  The census wasn’t a failure we got something better.  Try to keep up.

It’s not ridiculous.  What’s ridiculous is everyone not seeing the true purpose of the tweets.  It wasn’t an all out attack on crypto, it’s just another way for him to go after Facebook right after the social media summit.
Trump hates the FED and wants an audit.  When republicans control the house and senate in 2021, Rand Paul will introduce the Audit the FED bill, it will pass and Trump will sign it.  Then shit gets real.
Trump would love a gold/blockchain backed USD.  If everyone could pull their head out of their ass, we could get it done.

If you think Trump is an idiot, you need psychology help for your TDS.

except there is nothing reasonable about the BTC fees.  They are way too high.
@_date: 2019-03-10 02:35:13
No, it’s the perfect coin for him in every way.
@_date: 2019-03-29 18:11:54
Entitled?  Do you even know what that means?
@_date: 2019-03-29 18:47:55
As suspected, you have no idea what entitlement means.
@_date: 2019-03-29 18:33:53
Because they are paying you to see the ad you dunce.
@_date: 2019-03-17 00:16:03
Also a communist.
@_date: 2019-03-30 16:46:09
You're parroting inane propaganda and mistaking it for thinking.  Step away from your cheeto stained keyboard and get some air useful idiot. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 17:26:42
That's not spam, its an advertisement, but you already knew that since you stated it.
@_date: 2019-08-13 16:29:33
Well, anyone can see the open trades, the size and price.  It's called an order book and its public knowledge.
@_date: 2019-04-04 00:38:07
Still holding out hope he’s a Russian agent?

The people taking all your money.
@_date: 2019-09-12 14:09:17
Nobody is buying BCH thinking they are buying BTC.  
Literally, nobody.

If you're going to use a cliche, at least pick one that works.  My life is great, but keep projecting your shitty existence on me if it makes you feel better, IDGAF.
@_date: 2019-09-12 18:27:21
And you're so gullible you believed it.
@_date: 2019-09-12 18:40:57
I call morons out, yes in real life too.  Deal with it.
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:49:51
Right, gold is a much better store of wealth and you can't mine bitcoin without it.  Drop fiat, accumulate gold.
