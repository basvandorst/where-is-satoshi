I use guerrila mail often for new accounts. They dont sell account info. Very antispam and email addresses are complex and emails only last for 1 hour before auto deleting. 
So has to be one of the other 2 options.

The online WU never worked for me. I always had to go in and wait because of terminal errors. I also had to constantly go in with passport because thier system would "lose your info"... then theres the time I lost my credit card for inaccurate pin in their machine when it was the correct pin....

I can wait 9 weeks for a check
Edit. I think they are mad i won 36 times and lost 5 in last 3 weeks. I never would have bet with them if it wasnt for the fact they claimed to payout in 4-5 days via bitcoin

Im in the  country right now for credit card theft. These guys that are caught usually only pay a fine (with stolen money) and released. They also have a law that no citizen here can be extradited for any reason. These guys convicted of cc theft are also running and holding public offices in govt. They wouldnt care less of another govt called them and would probably only be interested in how they can shake down that guy and get a part of the money. 
@_date: 2015-04-11 12:30:55

I tried. No one will accept it. Some people claim to but then dont have the money. The banks here are scared of the govt and govt is corrupt. Any way they can scam people they do. Alot of people have smart phones but alot are still one old stick phones. 
And fyi since the US got involved last year the currency here has crashed and unstable. There was a period no one had USD and no banks had local currency to exchange. Right now the pm has caused hyper inflation and putting people in a bind.
@_date: 2015-04-11 12:33:45
This is a horrible title for this article. Should be :Various bitcoin wallets. Because thats all it is. Nothing new, no news on bitcoin, etc.


@_date: 2015-04-11 15:48:55
I dont really have the time to give you a lesson in economics, currency valuation and inflation but these three sectors are what you have to understand.
If no one accepted it then it has no trade for value. They more places that accept it the more people will have a "want" for the currency as it has a purpose to buy items and goods. Its a very simple concept.
@_date: 2015-04-11 11:03:26
You have a name not resolved error with your link. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:41:27
Theres the main guy right that has everything. By this international law he has to keep going back and staying there for now. Plus they have no treaties cause its not legal yet. Serbia or croatia can still protest and take the land. He stated already the only thing keeping him from giving up is if either said sent military over theyd leave it. You think he would die over protecting a crypto wallet with donations on something that started as a protest? I doubt that. On top of that the idiot opened up the "bank" for everyone to see what funds they have. Claiming wanting transparent govt. Thats fine if you have a military or at minimum armed security. But at this point they dont. 
@_date: 2015-04-12 02:39:03
Your looking at from a perspective of someone active in the communities. Thats not what this is about. Its for the people new to the community and has no knowledge yet of which company to use and which is a scammer. Its not just cyoa its covering the new people as well. That maybe came in yesterday and didnt hear last weeks thread that "xy company is a scam". They go to google, find xy company thinking its a legit business and lose thier money. Sure you didnt lose anything but as a community this new person will now probably be pissed at losing the money and tell everyone they know not to use bitcoin and how they were scammed. Why help hide the scammers by ignoring them?
@_date: 2015-04-18 06:37:59
Someone (a criminal) could forcibly go take thier current money and only have a crime in thier country with no police and no agreements with nato, UN, bordering countries. They have no judicial system to charge anyone.

Oh ok. Sorry. Just woke up so maybe misread it. Im hoping it will pick up and hopefully get a sidebar link from the mods and keep the info separate. I was a cop years ago and actually as an investigator for few years so keeping people safer and exposing criminals is kinda a thing for me.

@_date: 2015-04-22 06:20:59
I think your giving other countries too much credit. First if its not a major cyber crime its not worth their time. They still have to abide by local laws and what joint agreement they have with the other country. This is a theft not a murder, attack against govt, arson etc. Then you have to consider who will pay for extradition. Its not free and even in the US the originating court covers the cost. That includes holding per day, flight, cost to pay law enforcement for transport etc. Then foriegn corruption, is the guy still in possession of the bitcoin or not... all these things go into play and then ask yourself if you think they're willing to do that for a couple hundred dollars or thousands.

Its helpful and easier to use then paypal thru a credit card. I have bills I pay in multiple countries that often paypal doesnt work or i get paypal charging more money or charging money they were not authorized to charge. Google paypal siezing business accounts and see all the times they screw people over. I have a business account siezed with paypal right now and need to wait 6 months so they can send me a check for what they are unrightfully keeping.
@_date: 2015-04-10 07:52:30
I doubt its a manual check cause the pictures are completely clear. Easily readable and in high image quality. Any person looking at the picture can clearly read it and all the information on it. Thats why i tried to email them to have someone manually verify the documents but even that didnt go thru.

This is the dumbest thing Ive read on this whole thread. You obviously know nothing about domain registration and why people choose to keep it private.

@_date: 2015-04-11 17:01:03
That would single out new businesses that cannot be verified as fast. Often a new business will be good and later scam others once business is up and reviews are good.
@_date: 2015-09-16 06:42:45
Anyone have experience with this? Problems?
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:27:54
Lol dont get your feelings hurt. What Im saying is everything is an item. You think someone would die to keep thier password to the wallet safe? Fuck no. Thats not how it works. They wouldnt be hacking a password to gain access. These guys are in a 7sq km area and know the password to the wallet. Nothing to get it and move it thru force. You cant "its safe cause its encrypted". Criminals dont care about that. You think bank robbers go in a bank and say wait here while we try to guess the code for the vault?

Some will stop because of things like this. A few payment processors I use stopped. I take bitcoin on payments for services and Im stopping for now as well. I lost a couple hundred already in payments I took in because the drop. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:43:02
and $800 drop in a few hours...... some people bought high. People like me took payments in at the high rate. A $200 payment i took in the other day now is worth $160. 
I noticed places I pay with bitcoin shut down the service already.
@_date: 2015-11-03 07:38:52

been looking forward to the app getting out.
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:58:13
So places that normally used this wont after things like this. Say you have a product that costs you 150 and you sell for 180. then you had sold it for 180 worth of bitcoin and 2 days later the amount is 130. You are now in a negative of $20. As a business this isnt smart. 
You cant just argue and say its volatile while trying to get people and mainstream businesses to accept it as currency. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:06:43
You guys are lifesavers. I had a paypal business account for years for web development. Then when i moved there was no problem for 6 months and then they froze my account for 6 months. A client paid me and even got on phone with them from his verified account that everything was good. They still said all of sudden I was a security risk now ans and kept all my money locked up for 6 months. They refunded him his money because I refused to do the job since paypal wouldnt pay me (his lawyer threatened paypal and his money was reversed so he could pay me in Moneygram. Clients that know me well, pay me in bitcoin now but no real way to cash it out. 
Had to resort to sending it to a close friend to cash and send me WU when I did need the funds from it.
