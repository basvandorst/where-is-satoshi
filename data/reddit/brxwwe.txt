coinb.in is kind of a wallet, and can construct locktime txs

not sure what you mean, it just have to broadcasted like a regular tx, many wallets and websites can do that, including coinb.in
if the time is up it can be mined and the tx will go through, eg. sending the coins to the benefiters address otherwise it will be rejected.

it's a per transaction limit, not a daily one. you can make as many 0.25 btc transactions as you want but volum me is way to low on bisq, you won't find a counterparty

This could be easily solved by using ink cartridges that permanently mark the cash in case the ATM is tampered with or blown up. It completely stopped blowing up ATMs in some eastern European countries.

Bitstamp suspended your account? Can you still move your funds?

Accepting payments through their Bitstamp account? Like accepting bitcoin payments from third parties directly to their Bitstamp account?

you can always buy back in. If not then bitcoin is fucked anyways.
