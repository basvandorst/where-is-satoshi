Like other secure services, Bitcoin may need to be integrated into the OS.
@_date: 2016-08-08 14:42:25
You're right - if they want to continue they'll have to treat Bitcoin like any other secure system service and deliver it natively in the OS.

Thanks James - I wanted to request a feature for the BitPay iOS wallet:
Coin Control
So I can exhaust my current outputs completely, plan my future outputs better, and therefore pay less network fees since I can avoid creating small change outputs.

It's so short sighted!
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:16:43
Fucking checks and balances... You're right.

Plan B is Bitcoin stays as is. We bought, we formed companies, and we praised Bitcoin as is. 
Personally, I don't think forcing people out of Bitcoin, or forming plans against them aligns with the principles of Bitcoin.

Possibly region-restricted for anyone outside of US though.

Very True!
I'd look at that cost as 'human talent cost'. And Bitcoin does not require human talent to continue to manage/operate at it's current feature level. It just runs.
While bank bonuses are getting obscene, the talent pool of people that are willing to run these companies is getting smaller.
Who has the skills to manage these Goliath's AND is willing to risk being somehow implicated in the next DOJ fine/conviction? Very few, supply/demand, obscene bonuses.

President Trump didn't hire Bob Creamer to professionally organize and incite violence at the opposition's pre-election rallies.
President Trump doesn't sit idly while George Soros professionally organizes street violence against the opposition's supporters.
He's made some slapstick comments at rallies - I can't find an example of them being acted on. I've found President Trump's supporters generally act like adults and wouldn't incite violence regardless of what he says.

I didn't miss that phase at all.
I guess you missed the part of the Bitcoin paper which discussed transaction fees. I read it, maybe you didn't.
Nothing is free.

There will be Bitcoin banks that require monthly service fees too! 
BOA offers infrastructure - the $14 goes to card issuing, 1-800 number, insurance, big vaults, big office towers ;) etc.
Bitcoin protocol doesn't offer any of this and for that it's $0 monthly.
@_date: 2017-02-02 15:54:55
Exactly - to each their own solution.

Depends on how the CC merchant is setup. 
Before Bitcoin only ATMs would have the merchant code that creates a cash advance, but we've now seen with Circle that Bitcoin merchants may be getting that code as well.

Mining Bitcoin on Fed Server*

On mining at a loss: remember that mining at a loss still gets money out of China.
If you wanted to get 100M out....

Keep comments like this to yourself. Here is a developer working on a project that interests them, they are kindly releasing it for free to our community, asking for feedback, and your comment is *Useless*.
I don't know about everyone else on this sub, but I'm here for constructive development of the Bitcoin protocol and ideas around it. Not crap like the comments from this guy.
@_date: 2016-11-10 18:05:03
Exactly. Cites nothing but rumours to slur him. Move along.

Michel - owning Bitcoin means being in possession of cryptographic keys.
One way or another - you possess these keys. If you don't possess anything, you don't own Bitcoin.
With Blockchain.info, your keys are converted into the form of a login, a password. They claim they don't keep a copy of your login/password, and each time you login, their app converts your login/password back into the raw key form, and uses their web interface to let you access the Bitcoin associated with your key.
However, if Blockchain.info disappears, you'll need a way to convert your login/password back into a a raw key, and then use a different interface to transact using that key.
If this happened, it's a safe bet someone will build a quick converter to help themselves with this problem, then share it with the community.
Since you have to posses cryptographic keys anyway, you're better off keeping them in a form that is more universal, like a paper wallet (for long term storage) or a 12-word seed (for semi or regular usage in a variety of Bitcoin apps)

To the SegWit haters: We can still consider other options in concert with SegWit. 
There is no reason to block SegWit, an enhancement for all Bitcoin users.

Perfect use for my satoshis left in Changetip. 
Changetip PM'd me about the leftover balance yesterday and I just now emptied my account towards the Internet Archive.

The concept is: if you want this big fee for this new transaction, you'll need my previous input transaction to be confirmed too, whaddyasay?

Good, just don't rely on Authy as a solution to SMS 2fa. Use Time Based Tokens like the ones supported by Google Authenticator.
Authy uses SMS 2fa to create and manage your account, so it's exactly the same. In fact, they also support sending codes by Voice Call, meaning an attacker just needs to add call forwarding to your line to take your authy.

What was your 2016 contribution to Bitcoin Core? :P

That sucks man but the problem is electronic dollars are always reversible. If they don't draw a line and decline some customers, they'll have to close their doors to everyone eventually. It's just the nature of fraud prevention, but always leaves some good customers burned.
LBC cash deposit is as close to irreversible payment as you can get.
@_date: 2015-10-10 17:38:30
Two red flags.
1. Delayed delivery: the seller wants the payment to be sent before he sends the Bitcoin, in a way that provides you very little protection.
2. Deep discount on a cash-like item: would you trust someone selling $20 bills for $10?
I'd advise against communicating with that person again.

The BitAccess BTM's are known in this subreddit to have many issues. I'd advise against using or purchasing them. The Lamassu ATM's work much better.

That would be nice. An easy 100% you method, with the central nodes as the default/backup.
