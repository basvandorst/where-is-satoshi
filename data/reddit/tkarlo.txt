That’s like asking how would apples exist in a world without oranges. They’re entirely unrelated. You can both need and provide social welfare without inflation, because inflation is not a required component for either. 
In a deflationary environment, the incentive is to hoard money rather than spending it or lending it so it can circulate and be utilized to grow the economy. (See: hodl). This is bad for everyone and reduces total output, income and wealth.

Credit - and corporate debt - are one of the most useful inventions on earth. They allow you to more efficiently allocate capital and essentially move value back and forth in time, creating value. Much of modern business and consumer life wouldn't exist without them - imagine the housing market without mortgages.

What's your point? Credit is a good thing, at least as an option. You don't *have* to use it - you could have the credit card company immediately debit your account if you want. But it's an enormously powerful tool for both individuals and companies to manage cash flows by shifting them in time. Bitcoin may not directly support credit, but if it wants to be used as currency, it will need someone to start actively *offering* to provide credit in Bitcoin.

Most of the major credit card companies (Amex, Capital One, Citi) will issue a card online and immediately provide a virtual card number you can start using to make purchases. There's no need to wait for the physical card. If you have a credit history, the whole thing doesn't make more than a few minutes.

To be fair, interest - as measured by search activity - is down sharply.
