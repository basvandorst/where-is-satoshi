@_date: 2019-07-18 15:04:03
Will it go back down? This seems to fast
@_date: 2019-07-18 04:15:17
I’d like to sell and wait till it gets to 7.4K and then buy back but I don’t know what if it goes up now XD
@_date: 2019-07-14 19:28:08
@_date: 2019-07-21 10:38:38

SHUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUTTTTTTTT SHUT SHUT SHUT SHUT SHUT SHUT SHUTTY TUTTY SHUUUUUTTTTT SHUT SHUT SHUT
@_date: 2019-07-11 12:44:23
Let’s say you would really trvel back in time and you had your wallet with you.. what would happen to the bitcoins inside? Would you have the amauntand price  you had in the present or would it change to the price  and amount in that year to which you travelled.
@_date: 2019-07-09 03:28:24
To me it is so that the price drasticly falls while I sleep so that I cannot do amything about it.
@_date: 2019-07-15 07:55:29
I want you to be fake
@_date: 2019-07-17 18:26:00
Nice drawing, but I think that the eyes are a bit too big
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:45:44
Maybe is a good answer yes
@_date: 2019-07-05 16:20:23
True unfortunately I wasn’t old enough to buy it then( i was like 12)
@_date: 2019-07-08 18:58:21
I have seen this posted to this sub so many times today....
@_date: 2019-07-17 19:41:37
Do not give it any ideas mate
@_date: 2019-07-15 08:01:02
Idk jus prove it
@_date: 2019-07-24 10:20:34
I k ow right? It’s from 2018 and meybe the designis like that because it mentiones how blockchain could be similiar to how internet revolutionised the world back in the day
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:52:37
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:33:20
The laws of nature do not allow travelling back in time only foreard wpuld theoreticly work
@_date: 2019-07-11 18:39:22
Wow, you really took time to write that didn’t you
@_date: 2019-07-17 13:31:12
I did, now I hope it will at least stabilize for a bit
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:51:57
If you say that bitcoin is going to fall everyday, than one day you will be right,
@_date: 2019-07-13 18:35:27
What do you mean neither???You can’t possibly be a carrot?? Imposibruu

@_date: 2019-07-17 13:32:37
Aliens sound fairly plausible
@_date: 2019-07-16 14:48:23
What if you sell now waiting for the drop and then suddenly it goes up to 12.000 again?
@_date: 2019-07-21 11:21:58
But that would mean that bitcoin is a time machine wich would mean that bitcoin I own would also go back in time and few years ago I had no bitcoin at all
@_date: 2019-07-24 10:07:03
So far it is very good. Afcourse if you already know many things you will fund a lot of stuff that tou already know but dor someone who is new to everything blockchain and bitcoin it is quite nice
@_date: 2019-07-24 13:48:06
This book doesn’t contain only blockchain but also bitcoin and some other altcoins so shut the fuck up please thank you very much
@_date: 2019-07-15 07:57:21
@_date: 2019-07-03 17:56:22
But basicly same price
@_date: 2019-07-24 10:01:50

Don’t forget that on 3 day chart soon MA will cross and bitcoin will fall
@_date: 2019-08-13 10:59:47
@_date: 2019-08-17 17:57:18
I mean this is a MA Cross right? It is usually so that when green is under the red bitcoin is on the rise and when it crisses the red it goes down. That’s the pattern I noticed I don’t know if I am right or not
@_date: 2019-08-23 08:33:31

So what, I don‘t care I care about bitcoin not going the way it should
@_date: 2019-08-15 18:57:39
We are not talking physics but laws of nature that don’t allow the same matter to be at the same place at the same point in time
@_date: 2019-08-25 12:38:57
I like charts. There are primitive people on this sub that care only about Hodling
@_date: 2019-08-15 18:54:30
Time travell backwards in time is impossible, it defies the laws of nature. Only travel to future would be theoreticly possible

@_date: 2019-10-27 12:12:27
I see now that bitcoin network has degrded performance on coinbasePro maybe this is the case
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:21:09
Yes, but nobody beleived me back then that’s the pount. Sometimes trade analysis does show the truth
@_date: 2019-08-17 09:28:30
What do you mean? Is it not enough to just buy a hardware wallet ? What old stash do you have in mind?
@_date: 2019-08-13 08:47:25
Scammidy scammidy scam scam scam :D 
@_date: 2019-08-20 03:58:50
Don’t forget that on a 3 day chart ther will be a negative MA cross and bitcoin will drop down quite a lot

@_date: 2019-06-25 10:56:10
Finaly some € numbers ����
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:14:46
I personaly belive that the price falls when it stops growung and it stays around same number for few days, I was right three times now then I made a mistake when I didn’t sell after it quicky rose very high and then fell deep in minutes. And I taught, nah it will stabylise
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:11:10
Huh ��

@_date: 2019-08-22 08:50:39
Noo pplease this must not happen
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:22:10
Then make a meme for 16, you still have some time for that
@_date: 2019-06-24 13:59:26
But there you can deposit € money only with SEPA right? i don’t know how to use sepa because I never did and I don’t know how it works
@_date: 2019-08-13 07:00:07
Time travell backwards in time is physicly inpossible man.. the laws of nature do not allow two identical matters to exist at once. Only to future it would theoreticly be possible

@_date: 2019-10-23 13:27:01
It was not a prediction it was a fact that it will happen

If you think about bitcoin going down everyday, then one day you will be right
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:59:40
I remember setting stop loss one day on kraken and when I pressed sell it sold imediatly ifnoring the settings I made. I want to do it on bitstamp now

Can you explain this to me please, I am still learning about indicators and trade tools
@_date: 2019-06-24 07:10:22
Why? I already bought a lot of butcoin there with my mastercard, I just like bitstamo more because it has pretty graphs XD
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:58:00
Demons of the past started to clange their claws around me as I fear that Bitcoin will meet it‘s downfall again soon even though I try to convince myself that it will go higher than next time. I never exoerianced this growth so it‘s taking molly for the first time at the party
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:03:27
You forgot to count 4 hours of searching for the right photo of bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:05:07

You are much higher than I expected
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:41:36
thankfully it doesn't go left or right.
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:59:59
And what do you think? Will it go to like 10000 or 11000 or will drop back down to 3000
@_date: 2019-06-23 19:14:45
Yes they are very well drawn but I would prefer if they would go up instead of down, can you fix that please?
@_date: 2019-06-24 10:08:56
Excuse me sir, what is halving exactly
@_date: 2019-06-28 05:49:35
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:58:14
I have loss now because of this and It isn‘t stoping
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:53:19
That is a lie sir, I see no scams, only offer that are not accepted by rules
@_date: 2019-06-17 12:53:20
I know, but what does it mean for BTC? Will the price drop or go up or stay where it is or willthe aliens come and destroy the earth?!
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:09:31
So BTC is the chosen one?
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:41:03
Why foesn‘t it recover? Why doesn‘t it stop falling like this. This is insane

That’s not much of a dip
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:02:33
What does this have to do with nice guys ? Whaat ?��������������
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:20:13
The questin is also when and how fast will the drop be. If we learned anything from greek mythology about Icaros, this drop should be extremely big if btc rises high to fast and too much
@_date: 2019-06-24 09:59:33
The question I have is, how mamy cicles like 2017 can bitcoin have? Will it die eventually or will it continue with this patern. If it does I am fine with it as long as we don’t loose Bitcoin forever
@_date: 2019-06-24 09:49:26
I am from slovenia and I was always using coinbase for depositing money and buying and then I was sending them tmto kraken and bitstamp
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:20:55
Oh cmon haha don’t be harsh. I investet almost everything I have I have barley 21 yeas with 900€ that’s not a good position to invest millions
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:55:40
Thats why I‘m scared I don‘t have money pr time to lose everything rriigjt now
@_date: 2019-06-29 11:41:02
I have a loss of 200€ idk why I just do
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:07:26

I tried trading, and I did save some of my money from falling but yo never know when to sell and when to buy and I dont have a lot of knowledge or exepriance
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:31:33
I fon‘t have 0,1 bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-17 14:34:14
Does that mean I should sell everything and buy again when the price drops because of this event?
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:38:49
I did save my profit 3 times because I sold when it started to fall but i just don’t have the nerve anymore to do this
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:57:31
No because it doesn‘t want to stop falling

Do not wish for it to go back to its origin depths. Pray for it to grow wings and fly high above the sky
@_date: 2019-12-08 19:05:24
And at this moment in time, the price will skyrocket up towards the white stars as all the unbeleivers shall gaze upon it as it slowly reaches the highs that are unimaginable and unaccessible to them. And those who steped onto the rocket fueled by hope of freedom will cherish and rejoice their luck as their funds shall grow more and more
