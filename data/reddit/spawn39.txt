No, I am aware atm I am losing slightly with regards to electricity vs income but I believe in the technology and the trip to the moon. I am sure at the end of the day, I will gain good and proper. Side note: VERY powerfull pc, mostly electricity saving components and settings. Running on power saving for CPU and under volted GPU.

HODL stands for Hold On for Dear Life
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:00:53
Aahh. Sounds like we are saying the same thing then. My bad. I didn't mean it is what it officially mean. Just that it is what it is used for now
@_date: 2018-03-29 08:16:07
Close your ears boys....this gonna be loud as hell: "HODL!!!" I am a small tiny miner. Mining on my gaming peecee..lol. I am not in a financial position to buy, even in the best of dips, I can only slowly accumilate by mining. Luckiy I can afford the electricity without having to sell my BTC. But blockchain is a technology with almost limitless potential and application. It is not going anywhere. It's here to stay and so is grandpa Bitcoin. Nevermind the doomsayers and weak hands. Hold on for dear life people. Give the Corporations, Bankers and Goverments time to acclimate to the new and improved future. They will come around eventually and then it will be our time to lift off.

Good. I hope the f will be forced to drop GPU prices drastically. I have no problem with demand driving up prices but they were just greedy as hell.
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:51:54
Yes it does. Some redditor one night while drunk said: He was going to HODL. It then became common practice to say HODL and was adapted along the line to Hold On for Dear Life. Or so the story goes. Try using google. Quite simple really
@_date: 2018-03-29 09:46:01
Sure, I am only 43 years old, but yes, ok, my parents bought the pc. I can pay the electricity because 1. Its not too expensive, 2. I do not mine during peak hours when the price is double (4hrs a day), and 3. I have family responsibilities. The amount I pay on the extra electricity is what I can safely afford to lose.
Any other dumbass "I am the bitcoin mining expert of the world" comments?

Don't have FB. Not a social media fan. Was send this 1 by a friend. Is it really so difficult to just enjoy a post and move on? Or if you've seen it, skip it and move on? Unearthed a jewel...really Mr. Assumption, where did I say that?
Everybody is either a trade or crypto expert, a spelling nazi or a social media boss. Why post a comment just to be negative?
Oh wait, I know why, cause hiding behind the internet makes you feel like a big man, while in real life you are a fart in the wind
@_date: 2018-04-20 08:34:49
In your extremely unimportant opinion it's a shitpost. Why? Because it hit you where it hurts. Big mouth FUDster that has nothing to say now that BTC is doing well. Other redditors might enjoy the post, but only your opinion matter in your tiny little world where you reign supreme. Sorry to tell you dungeon boy, living online is not a social life. Having real contact with people offline is a social life.

@_date: 2018-04-07 18:47:16
Lol.....I know, but I enjoy seeing everyone's true opinions ( not just plain old FUD), what they get from their charts, links they post that has insight to bitcoin related matters, etc. ;)
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2018-04-20 08:53:03
I own BTC but don't have time for TA. So I pop in as much as I can to get a feel for what other people see and do.
@_date: 2018-04-16 04:47:19
Looked at your previous posts. Not only are you completely wrong with every post about Bitcoin, you are a troll. Blocked

Maybe not the best advice, and I know my HODL friends will disagree, but it might come back and bite you in the ass if you give her cash and bitcoin moons. Give her half of the bitcoin and be done with it. No comebacks. And keep a record of it for the rest of your life.

@_date: 2018-04-20 08:26:28
See that is the difference between you and me. I have a social life in abundance in the real offline world. Real flesh and blood friends and family. My social life keeps me too busy to spend hours online. Don't worry, I am sure you will get a friend one day. I am not in the least upset. I am however puzzled why people like you have such a superiority complex to think that if you seen something before, no one else have a right to see it. "Everyone in the world: Only post things I have never seen before, or else I'll...I'll...I'll....I'll downvote you!! Ha ha ha, burned! You under estimate my power of the downvote!"

Tax deadlines also differ in other coutries. Tax selloffs (if that is what is happining) should continue till month end. But propably in lower volumes.

Says the FUDster? My apologies for the low quality you highness. You see, I did not film it myself.
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:54:03
You are right, of course. He just got under my skin, thinking of all the people he might talk into selling at a loss by playing on their fears. This a sub for discussions around bitcoin, not for people who wants nothing to do with bitcoin, like he pretends to be.
@_date: 2018-04-20 07:48:54
I know, but just seemed appropriate when you think about how the FUDstars just appear when BTC drops and then dead silence when it climbs. Just trying to bring some humour to the day
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:04:21
Lmao! In your dreams. No idea what a hodler is, do you now? You can pry the bitcoin from my dead cold fingers ;P

@_date: 2018-04-07 18:31:15
Wait, is MrManHimself still posting on here? I blocked him yesterday for spouting the same unsubstantiated negativity over and over and over and over.....While he thinks what he is posting is very clever and insightful, all that he is doing is spreading FUD and using "brilliant" hindsight to try and prove his point. I have never seen anyone with so little of a life before. If bitcoin dies, I will move on with my life, go do something else. This poor basement dweller spends hours on this sub, trolling and spreading FUD for all he is worth. All he is managing to do is showing that he is actually a poor sodd that lost his shirt with bitcoin and he is so scared that anyone else can be successful. So scared bitcoin will go to the moon, he cannot go on with life. All he has ever done was ask for proof or ask "what do you really mean by saying this or that". Not one valid point ever, not 1 shred of proof for what he is sprouting except: bitcoin did this and bitcoin done that", ignoring the fact that bitcoin also did GREAT in the past. I advice everyone to block him. The peace from silencing him is worth at least 20 bitcoin. Don't bother trying to reply to me MrJokeOfTheSub, I will not see it anyway. NOTE: r/bitcoin: a community dedicated to bitcoin. If you do not believe in bitcoin, then go away, we do, and no amount of trolling or FUD from you will change that. Side Note: I am truly sorry for your financial loss, but how about giving others a chance?
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:38:32
Been reading his posts for days, while on this sub, looking for true insight, just finally got tired of his posts. I still believe in BTC, so yes, I spend a fair amount of time here, and the essay, took 10 minutes to type. So except for the failed attempt to put me off, any other insights to Bitcoin perhaps? Do you have something meaningful to add to the sub?
@_date: 2018-04-15 06:35:30
You just took the step to upgrade your security for your bitcoin. Why fuck around? It's true about the hack chip that gets installed, but don't know if it has been solved. Return it and buy one from the manufacturer.

You know what, lets end this. I am really not this type of person and I apologize for my behaviour. Just months of seeing unnessesary cruelty in comments, got under my skin. If the post bothers you so much. I'll delete it. If I can, not sure how tho. Have a good day further and all the best with your investments
@_date: 2018-04-20 08:39:32
I know you do not know how the real world works so I'll explain. It is now Friday 10:30 am. Me and my friends work for a living. Not living off mommy in her basement. We socialize on weekends. Difficult to comprehend, but take a moment, I'll wait
