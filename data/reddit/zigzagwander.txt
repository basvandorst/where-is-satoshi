I guess cashing out with zero is 'never'  :)

You see that house refleced in the bubble? Invest that house in bitcoin. 
I'm pretty sure he's saying that....

To my mind, and I'm no economist at all, it sounds like that. Not a 'fictitious enterprise' but a 'virtual thing'. I can't even call it a product, because it has zero substance. 
Then I realised that all money, from gold onwards, is the same, really. Diamonds, for another example, are a perfect example of a fictitious demand generated for a real product. 
In reality the supply &amp; demand of bc is all fictitious, but then again so is all currency trading. 
Now I am back to not knowing *shrug* but I'll take my cash if and when I reach my goal.

I was talking to someone today about it. They said they had heard you could make 10% or more a year. I said I'd made 10% today!  :) 
Still prepared to cash out with zero, but.

Paper mail? Is that really still a thing?

So godamned English. I mean crumpet? Outside of England that's definitely got a different meaning :)

I've planned to slow sell once I meet my retirement goals (I'm retired), then keep as much as possible in for future growth and use. My plans involve a pretty high end price, but I'm sure 5 or 10 years will let it happen.

Almost succumbing to buyer's frenzy, but I'm keeping it to plan so far. Slow &amp; steady for the long haul.

Or... 
Most private investors still haven't worked out how go do it, and are slowly getting up to speed, sustaining the bubble for a while to come. 
Or... 
So many scammers on the trading sites will scare off most noobs (I see a load). 
Dunno which.

Well done you! 
Set a goal. Keep to it. That's a win in anyone's book. 
I have similar plans but for my current retirement, but I'll leave some in, even if as a legacy for my gandkids :)
