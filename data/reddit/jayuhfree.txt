It all comes down to one thing - are there more buyers or are there more sellers.  A big sell can take a while to finish, and will drive the price lower depending on its limits.

And this is actually a good wakeup call to the Bitcoin community.  
Keep records of every transaction!  Keep good records for tax time... When next year comes around - or maybe even this year - you might not be so gungho to stick it to the tax man.  Think about it...

Although there's a lot of silly 'Friedcat for President' stuff in the BitcoinTalk thread, it is really very important to understand the people you're involving your investment with.  I was persuaded by Friedcat's informative updates and the general regulars on the board, many of whom were in on the IPO.  There's some good skeptical thinking in there too, related to the 2016 changes, upcoming competition, etc.

Checked in earlier this week and it was reporting 5 extra bitcoins than I should have had (those 5 had been transferred to a wallet 2 weeks previously).  I assumed it was just a bug in their display and that if I had attempted to transfer it, the chain would have shown the coin's transfer.

My other brokerage accounts don't tell me about each partial fill, just the order that I placed, and only when it is fully executed.  
When I am on the Order Page (listing all my open orders) and I hit New Order it takes me back to a two button dialog which doesn't have New Order selected, but instead View Orders on the Order Details dialog.  I have to hit New Order twice to place a New Order from the View Orders page.  When you hit New Order it should take you to the New Order dialog, not a dialog giving me two options, to View or New.

Right, the painter doesn't declare his newly finished work as income.  My spouse is an artist and when she sells something its full price (minus deductions for materials) is reported as income.  If you are producing a product, you are not taxed until it is sold.  Bitcoins should work the same way.   Bitcoins aren't a recognized currency, and that definition is confusing.  We call it a currency, but for tax purposes it's either an investment (capital gains) or its a tool for barter, which would work as income.

Thanks for that!  Problem is, the trade is between arbitrary things of value.  These are pieces of data - for a pizza.  It is the Bitcoin's community's convention that it's a currency but for the IRS, I'm suggesting that it's more arbitrary.  There is no currency - it's just a token.

1. Cyprus has demonstrated that all the FDIC and EU banking promises are lies.  The too big to fail banks demonstrated that their parasitism was greedy enough to destroy the host.  This is an endgame.  
2.  The media is writing about it. Seems like every business news source is on it.  My spouse was saying the price is going up because of the [New Yorker]( article.
3.  The price increase itself produces more lift, which is a traditional bull market up-surge.  People are scared they're missing the boat and try to get it at any price.  Bull market hysteria.  
4.  Lack of sellers - that was what I was getting at before.  Traditionally, in a bull market, those who bought near the bottom cash out.  "The prices is too frothy for me here..."  This is not functioning like a bull market stock rise as bitcoin is practically a piece of limited edition hardware for the economy of the future.  People are expecting gains of 2000% to 200,000%.  These are very novel expectations and the idea that the prices gains signify something new... well typically, when you hear, during a bull market that "things are different this time" it's a signal to sell.  This really is something fantastically new with these forms of expectations of gain.  
Finally, here's another traditional test about when to sell in a bull market:  When you go to a party and there is nothing anybody is talking about except bitcoins.  I remember going to a party in NYC in 2005 - and there was nothing but real estate being talked about.  We're a long way from that scenario.

Yes, I understand that, but I was guessing that instead of buying specutively, that the 'market' was busy moving btc between exchanges.  In other words, the focus had changed to an arbitrage-centered market while there was this cross-exchange differential.

Silly! I liked it too, had that 80's retro but without the FM synth harshness.  That kind of weirdness needs high contrast in the chorus, though, not just more instrumental descending chromatic notes.  I'd loved to have heard a kind of David Byrne long note kind of wailing before the Sound of Music dance.  That would have given the listener the expectation of the return of the short burst spoken part again.  Bring back the chorus - while simultaneously doing the spoken part for the climax and voila...

I thought that EDIT was clear enough for folks to get the point that I was wildly exaggerating that last bit.  Apparently not... 
There's no way the Chinese yuan could become the reserve currency.  That is obvious to everyone.  But they can continue to erode faith in the dollar's status and push for the [international basket of currencies through an SDR]( to become the new reserve.  I'm not up to debating whether that is feasible or not!   
Both gold ownership and Bitcoins could contribute to that erosive process, currently under way with the currency swaps and direct exchanges.

I pasted in an address I created in Electrum into the [CoinWidget]( widget, and tested it by sending myself that little bit.  
The [widget]( is up there on the top right.  Looks pretty ordinary.  
It was an address I'd never used before and since it's Electrum, I doubt my private key's been compromised.  That would take a keylogger?  Nothing else weird has happened to my Electrum wallets.  
I was thinking they'd created a bogus transaction with my address.  It had failed confirmation and I'd lost that little bit to the fees?  
EDIT: Well, now I'm totally confused.  It was me!  So, Electrum selects an address at random from my addresses when I send coins and it showed up as a transaction from that address?  Funny, how my widget made it look like there had been two donations!  
FWIW, I never assumed I'd been stolen from, just harassed with a failed transaction.

This is interesting in ways people might not expect.  The Chinese are very interested in having the US dollar not continue as the world's reserve currency.  They'd like to see the renminbi become it but they are very practical.  This is why they've forging agreements to settle trade directly between countries.  Recent agreements have happened with Brazil, Australia and Japan for direct currency exchanges, avoiding the conversion to the dollar.  
This is national TV.  This means official sanctions on the coverage.  Could they be looking at Bitcoins as becoming the world's currency?  
**EDIT: Just a tiny postscript from a conversation I was just having with a friend.  From the Chinese perspective, there might be some value in allowing Bitcoin to prosper, if only to become a thorn in the side of America's reserve currency status.**

Sure.  I'm not explaining it well.  The first time you click New Order it takes you directly there.  
1.  New Order - takes you directly to New Order
2.  Submit Order then takes you to the Open/Closed Orders Page
3.  Now hit the New Order button from the top of the screen while Open/Closed Order is up. - It takes you to the New Order/View Orders dialog.  
4.  At that point, even clicking Overview takes you to the 2 choice New Order/View Orders dialog.

Thanks!  Sorry to waste your time... I'd figured it out.  It was me and Electrum had been using my the tip jar address for a transaction that I had authorized.  The widget had picked that up as a transaction and displayed it as a 'gift'.  
I understand that private keys were needed... I just knew I hadn't been ripped off and was wondering if it was just a kind of harassment, since the transaction would fail without my private key. 
You're right, though.  I evidently don't understand the whole chain of authorization very well!

The Chinese are fighting battles on multiple fronts and they make little moves, not big moves.  They still have their billion poor who live off less than $1.25 a day.  They have to please the oligarchs and the bankers and they have to continue to please Apple, and their clients for their immense manufacturing base.  Apparently, they are no longer large purchasers of US Treasuries and are now focusing on buying companies and commodity producers.  You're right, these currency swaps and agreements are for show - but that's how they do things.  
The Chinese government is now [encouraging gold ownership]( which is a similar kind of foil against America (whose rumored manipulation of the gold market looks a little bit less tin-foil hattish every day).  Like I said in my edit, it's an easy win for them to just look aside and let Bitcoin play out in the global arena, even if it's just a foil to screw with America's hegemonistic reserve currency status.
