They really can't respond any differently. Basically, their public statements can reflect either positively or negatively on the business they have invested in. It is not in their interest to piss anyone off unless it would somehow help (or at least not hinder) their business.
If I were to guess, I would say they are probably pissed off by what has happened. Both at the Justice Department and Shrem. Probably mostly Shrem. But coming out and saying, "Fuck that guy, I hope he rots in prison," doesn't really help their business prospects even if that's how they feel. Conversely, saying, "Fuck the Justice Department, it's not our company's job to restrict what our customers do with their money," also doesn't help even if that's how they feel (and it also might implicate them as more active participants in the scandal).
TL/DR, being compliant is all they can do and it almost doesn't matter how they feel about it.

Allow me to elaborate. The US and Japan are allies. Therefore they likely have extradition agreements (the details of which I am not familiar with because IANAL). Mt Gox did business in the US, subjecting it to the laws of the US. But this is better than I thought would happen, somebody "important" must have assets tied up in Gox.

The only number he pulled out of his ass was the &gt;$320 number. But, I don't think that is an unreasonable prediction at all. I mean hell, the price has been between 300 &amp; 400 for quite a long time now. It's hard to say when the price trend might start moving up again, but in the absence of a major protocol security blunder or a major exchange or processor going bust, the price really should start moving up at some point if transaction volume and adoption continues moving forward. But you're right, he definitely shouldn't have spoken in terms of absolute certainty, because nothing is guaranteed to pan out.

This is a terrible idea. The Mt.Gox name is completely tainted. The code is demonstrably bad. It's dead. Any efforts to revive the exchange would cost money in overhead (coding, facilities, infrastructure, etc.). Furthermore, the plan these idiots are proposing is to completely drain Mt. Gox of its remaining assets by immediately paying out to creditors on a pro rata basis. Well what are they going to use to revive the company? Sunshine and happy thoughts? They're certainly not going to get outside investments. I know I sure as shit wouldn't reinvest my payout back into Mt. Gox.
No. The only way forward is to liquidate. Pure and simple. If someone wants to buy the Mt. Gox name and rebuild it themselves, godspeed to them. It is an asset that can be sold during the current liquidation proceedings along with the domain names.
Actually, now that I think about it, I want more of you guys to want try to keep Gox alive. Maybe you'll be dumb enough to bid against each other to buy the Mt. Gox brand and that'll increase the pool of monetary funds I can be paid back with.

Are you familiar with Bitcoin?  
Yes, no, not sure are all valid responses
Do you believe Bitcoin hurts the US Dollar?  
Yes, no, not sure are all valid responses
Do you believe Bitcoin helps the US Dollar?  
Yes, no, not sure are all valid responses. The "no" response from the previous question cannot be assumed to be an affirmative response to this question.
Would you consider using an alternative currency like Bitcoin?  
Yes, no, not sure are all valid responses
Would you rather own gold instead of Bitcoin?  
Yes, no, not sure are all valid responses. In this case, the no responses can safely be assumed to mean someone would rather own Bitcoin than gold. Edit: and to control for bias, this question should have the order reversed in half of the surveys.
At least that is how I'd word the questions. If a survey does not allow "not sure" as an option for all of them, it is an invalid survey. Let me repeat that again: if a survey has even 1 question without all appropriate responses available, the whole survey is invalid.

Well, hey, if they want to stake their money on it, why not. I still think they are pretty dumb for taking on the enormous liabilities and not actually making money for a long time. The worst possible outcome for everybody, though, is that whoever gets control of the remaining bitcoins either accidentally destroys them, loses them, or steals them. As long as I get my share of the existing remaining bitcoin, I won't be any more upset than I am now. If they can somehow pull off a miracle and get permission to buy out and revive Mt. Gox and I get more of what I lost back, I'd be pretty happy.

Well, there was additional downward pressure in that instance due to eroded investor confidence in Bitcoin as a whole. I would argue that Gox users regaining access to Gox coins would not even come close to restoring that confidence that was lost.
Of course I could be wrong, maybe it will spark a buying frenzy. If enough people seem to think the price is going to go up and decide to buy as a result, the price will obviously go up (assuming they outbuy the Gox sellers).

Enjoy your blood money. Because that's what the majority of it is if Mt. Gox truly is insolvent. Obviously the share you got out is a drop in the ocean, but if Gox continues to push out withdrawals only to fiat holders, they are fucking the bitcoin holders sideways. Do something worthwhile with what you were able to get out.

My point is if you're truly convinced an investment is going to become worthless and shout it to the world, you kind of look silly buying in yourself in any amount.

I get irked when people imply that Bitcoin is as good now as it will ever be.
Bitcoin can iterate; all it takes is for 51% of the network to agree to a protocol adjustment. Of course, this might be easier to do now than in the future, but as long as Bitcoin developers can unequivocally demonstrate that a proposed change would be a benefit to everyone, there's no reason for anyone to stand against it.
Edit, and furthermore, Bitcoin has the benefit of momentum behind it. I see alt-coins as a test-bed for ideas Bitcoin could potentially adopt in the future.

I think the biggest problem with that specific question is the vagueness of the word "familiar". I mean what does "familiar" mean in this context anyway? Does it mean somebody who has heard the word Bitcoin, but knows nothing more? Does it mean someone who's aware that it is a digital currency? Or does it mean someone who's read the white paper and uses it on a daily basis? There are many contexts in which someone might be unsure if they are familiar with something. In fact, if "not sure" is not an option, people would tend to lie more and say they are familiar with it simply because they don't want to appear ignorant. This is why statistics, as a discipline, is so difficult.

A lot of the money they got wasn't "their" money.
Edit, look, it's simple math. If Mt. Gox only has like 1/10 of the assets it needs to cover its clients' investments but it is paying 100% out to some people, everyone else is getting screwed out of the 1/10 they're owed.

You're completely wrong. "Found" bitcoins increase the pool of available currency and many, many people will run to sell if they get control over their bitcoins again. Speculators would actually start the sell off, anticipating the price drop, so that they can turn a profit by buying back in when the faucet is actually opened at Gox. I think it's highly possible the news of the found 200k coins is helping to keep the price down.

I just can't imagine Satoshi expecting folks to take someone reported to be him at his word without verifying cryptographically that it's him. It's one thing if it was a forum account under his control or something, but considering it's been years since people have heard from him, I think it's obvious people would like cryptographic proof of his identity were he to re-emerge.
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:51:33
If there's not a printed message signed with Satoshi's key, it's a false claim. If Satoshi wanted to prove his identity, it'd be trivially easy to do so.

See, the problem I think with your analogy is that this account that was compromised was very likely a Mt.Gox company account with a huge supply of BTC. What regular customer in their right mind would keep $8million in BTC on Mt.Gox? What you're saying is tantamount to saying that, back when banks kept gold reserves, if somebody stole the gold, the bank shouldn't try to get it back. I don't know about you, but when I buy BTC on Mt.Gox, I want to know that they'll actually have BTC available for me to withdraw.
Edit, I have no basis for my conclusion other than hearsay.

This is a really dumb petition. They're a business, they'll accept whatever payment they want. If it becomes a measurable opportunity cost to their bottom line, they'll either start accepting it or someone will eat their lunch.

So, free speech is a fundamental right, yet there are limits that everyone agrees are acceptable to impose upon that right. 
The only exceptions I can think of to my statement about accepting any form of payment being a fundamental right are that it's illegal to accept things that are also illegal to possess as payment (like illicit drugs) and some services can't be substituted as payment (like sex). If I am willing to accept Euro for goods or services in the US, though, it would set a very dangerous precedent for the US government to tell me I can't accept it. The most any government should be able to say is that I *have* to accept their fiat currency if the customer has enough of it to buy my goods/services at a reasonable exchange rate (as determined by the free market). But it shouldn't be able to require people to accept *only* fiat. The government also should have the right to collect taxes only in fiat.
@_date: 2013-06-06 03:36:09
Exactly what I was thinking.
For anyone who may be scratching their head, the way marginal taxes (as used in the USA) work is that tax rates only apply to the amount of dollars earned within that bracket. For simplification, let's say the tax rate from $0-$10,000 is 10% and the tax rate from $10,000 to $20,000 is 15%. If you make $15,000, the first $10,000 of that is taxed at 10% and the remaining $5,000 is taxed at 15%. Income taxes suck, but not that much. 
Of course, I'm sure the average bitcoiner already knows this, so I'm probably preaching to the choir, but TLDR, the author of the article is clearly an idiot.

Who determines what a bitcoin is worth? Speculators. The successful ones either have advanced information about future price changes, know intimately how markets move, or are plain lucky. There is no "actual price" for anything in this world, only what people will pay for it or accept in exchange for it. There is going to be a downward price correction and it's going to happen soon. It's a pattern at this point. I bet the peak will be flatter this time unless there's another major exchange scare. But it's almost certainly going to happen.

@_date: 2013-01-28 22:39:28
I don't see how the government could justify a ban on any currency or even hope to catch people using it. It's a fundamental right to accept any payment I want for a product or service including barter or even no payment. They would make a lot of people really really fucking angry if they tried while also making awareness of Bitcoin and its subsequent popularity explode.

That is interesting for certain and it would be a little more troubling if there was a central organization behind Bitcoin. One big problem with Liberty Dollars is they created a physical, minted currency. Now, obviously, the distinction between physical and digital currency is shrinking, but it works in Bitcoin's favor that there's currently not explicit legislation in place to deal with digital currencies. What I'm saying is that the laws that make Liberty Dollars illegal were put in place a while ago whereas legislation to deal with Bitcoin would have to be introduced and pushed through one of the most ineffective Congresses we've ever seen. I think we're in a race between general public awareness and acceptance of its existence and Congress pushing through legislation to ban it. The Bitcoin lobby is non-existent, so representatives from both parties would waste no time in banning it while justifying their vote by slandering its proponents (it funds the terrorists! Drug dealers use it!). But you can bet your ass off I'll call all my representatives if they propose legislation making it illegal for me to use it.

There are ways we could keep high profile businesses on the up and up. We could legally require companies to register bitcoin addresses for various internal accounts and this could actually make corporate accounting much more transparent. If large sums of bitcoin disappear from companies to unknown addresses, the company would have to provide an explanation. I think this would benefit everybody: shareholders, citizens, and government alike.

If the bet was made in bitcoin, I'd have 25% more coins and they'd be 200% of their present value which means if I bet $1,000 worth of bitcoins now, I'd have $2,500 worth at the moment I won the bet. Not too shabby. Of course I could lose it all, so the risk of that would keep me from making such bets.

Google would be really stupid to buy $50million worth of BTC all at one time. Many people would start putting in sell orders well below $1000 if they saw the price creeping up. Google would have much more BTC if they bought slowly over a few months, maybe even a year. They would buy slowly in advance while planning and probably throw some of their massive infrastructure into mining. Then, when they announced their entry into the market, like you said, their holdings and everyone else's would immediately sky-rocket in value as an influx of giddy new users swarms to their services. At *that* point, it could conceivably spike toward the $1k bitcoin.
