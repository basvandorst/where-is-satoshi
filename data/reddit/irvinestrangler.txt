Oh Winklevoss, the guy that didn't invent Facebook. The guy who has done jack shit with his life and knows nothing in the world that anybody here doesn't know. Yeah let's listen to him because he's so much less informed than everybody else.

Thanks for providing absolutely no facts at all. You're just talking about of your ass without a single fact to support anything you've said. You've learned nothing. This is exactly the type of ignorant confidence I'm talking about. It's rampant around here. You haven't learned the fundamentals of finance, you learned nothing. The only difference is you now think you know what you're talking about. But hey, it's the internet, your ignorance is as good as my knowledge. Good luck with that.

Only if you can sell it for that. Good luck making that happen.

That has nothing to do with the law, nor do political views make a person an activist. 
Chinese supporting Snowden isn't the same as Americans supporting Snowden. It's not even in the same ballpark. Not even on the same planet.

Thanks for misappropriating the meaning of a well-balanced portfolio. Hilarity. Pretty much the extent of people's knowledge of finance on though. One of the most assbackwards, underwater subs. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:35:10
That's a stupid question. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:24:10
Not everyone wants to be an activist just because you do. Most people want to live their lives not squeeze around laws, especially in China. That's a very young thought you have. 
If you want to do that, go for it. Nobody in China will be behind you.

AMA about Rampart. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:34:28
That's not what happened at all. Maybe you should actually read the article before posting. 
Everyone on is so fucking stupid too fucking much. Shit...

Fuck... reddit silver just crashed... i had everything in reddit silver

I know he is - so am I. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:04:45
That's relatively short-term thinking. Kind of pathetic actually.

It wasn't bought with bitcoins. It was converted to cash by a 3rd party and the Lambo was bought with U.S. dollars.

It's funny because the advice here is so thoughtless and asinine. All their advice and numbers come completely out of thin air. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:34:20
I never said anything to the contrary. Doesn't your ass hurt from riding those dicks? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:00:03
They could tag you "ignorant; do not read". 
Thanks for proving that you can't make a single argument and that you are worse than someone who knows nothing on the subject. At least someone who has never heard of any of this is a blank canvas, you're learning wrong (as some kind of joke I take it?). 
Ad hominem is barely within your capabilities. You should be embarrassed for yourself. I don't even know why you're posting if you literally cannot contribute anything at all whatsoever.

Satoshi isn't a single person. 
And if he is single... dibs. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:26:08
Yep. Nothing very impressive or even in the ballpark of China. Were you just asking a question or did you have a point to make? Because you didn't even come close to making a point if that was your intention. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:27:00
Let's cut that shit diagonally. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:56:26
Why don't you make an actual argument rather than post this complete and utter uselessness? 
The stupid fucks around here... holy shit. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:49:00
Well for one Satoshi Nakamoto isn't just a single person. So...

Everyone who did that needs to lose their life savings. Everyone who uses bitcoin to invest is an idiot. I don't even have to prove it, you're all proving it right now, as we speak. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:00:07
Pro tip: Don't be irresponsible with your money. If bitcoin bottoming out makes you want to kill yourself, you invested far more money than you could actually afford. 
No pity for little girls who know not what they do. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:07:33
It's the escalation of commitment bias. People progress horrible decisions because they're already invested so much in these horrible decisions up to this point. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:30:32
What a cute metaphor! Do you have any that actually contain wisdom and logic or just this one that can only be used to try to push attention away from your own obvious shortcomings and poor decisions? 


Unfortunately this is how a lot of people in China think, it sums up their mentality quite well. It's sad. That's why China is so atrocious. Unfortunately for China most other countries don't follow the same stunted mindset, turning China into a country that habitually and consistently lies to it's people and the world more than any other country on record.

Personally I feel it's unduly politicizing this subreddit in matters completely unrelated to bitcoin. I'm pro-choice in regards to suicide and find it offensive that someone would try to deter someone from suicide if that's what they want to do in the heat of the moment. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:10:59
You're all the same people, some of you just got here later. Nobody on has the slightest clue about even fundamental finance and they're not ever going to. This is going to happen again and again until the day-traders who actually know what they're doing take over however long from now.
