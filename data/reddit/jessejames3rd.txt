How are the keys generated in different timelines good for a different timeline?
 I do not think even with quantum theory if two keys are generated at the same time in different timelines that the keys would be the same.

Maybe add LTC, XMR (Monero) &amp; ETH, Please. All are on coinbase but XMR. Most in the USA buy with Coinbase.
Everyone in Crypto need more adoption, so, Thank you for what you are doing.
You Rock

Mass Adoption is near. Everyone will at the very least know what Cryptocurrency is soon, especially Bitcoin.
I see this, I think, Yay

Get a coinbase account. buy bitcoin. it's that easy.
There are others. But this will work
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:42:53
Indeed it will. That and much more!
@_date: 2019-04-01 00:57:52
They used this here too...
@_date: 2018-11-14 05:03:44
probably not many for sale in the Raleigh NC area. But I just wait the 7 days for Coinbase and I never pay fees and I get the token for whatever I bid in at. Again at no fees. But that wait is why I think people use this. To get it instantly into an account. I have no idea where they would use them that quickly besides sending money around the world to love ones. Maybe if BTC is on a Bull Run and they want to turn cash into BTC, ASAP.

Thank you for the information.
I'll keep this in mind.
I too dislike Bcash

Grew up in Raleigh. This looks like Crab-tree Mall or maybe the other one near Capital Blvd.   
I am so happy to see this in NC. Hopefully one will make it's way to Wilmington NC area soon and Charlotte NC and other metro areas here in NC.
Thanks for the photo and share.
You rock

Sucks this still does not have way more than 150k signatures by now. 
But this won't gain his freedom, not in the USA, they both Hate and Love the black markets, while running them, using them, and then jailing those who use them.

Is there really such thing as cheap flying? I mean unless you get unfilled seats the day of the flight I don't know of any real "Cheap" flying at least not where I am in the USA and to anywhere I'd want to go....
@_date: 2018-04-21 02:48:18
here it comes... to stay on the way to 20k and more. I hope we see huge growth and public adoption this year. I want the world to use Crypto. Especially Bitcoin, Litecoin and Monero.
