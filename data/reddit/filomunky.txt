Thanks for this summary - it's the most concise explanation I've seen and exactly what I was looking for :) 
Guess that's the benefit (and, at times, frustration) of Open Source in blowing away those barriers to entry. Whether each is acting in competition or not (and I tend to side with the latter, given the size of the opportunity - albeit the battle for developers and mindshare gives weight to the former), it's very easy here on the sidelines to wish that everyone just got together damnit to head off down the same path to speed things up.... Realise it's never that simple in practice though.

Is Abra using Colored Coins? What version?

Cheers - I definitely want to explore Open Assets a bit further given the publicity but I want to make sure I cover the whole CC ecosystem. Definitely some cool projects going on across each of the areas.

I don't know, I think they will be able/authorised to pick up those tips. They'll have a huge team managing the social presence today and a slick structure in place for the day's activities I'm sure. Fully respect your decision to go direct - fair play - but maybe you could add something tiny like 10p-worth via ChangeTip as well? If they get hundreds donating that way, that'll soon add up. It's more about giving charities the information that there's another option for accepting donations. The money donated this way itself this year may not change the world but I'm only suggesting this because I honestly think it might help them (and others charities who try to learn before their own campaigns). Anything that makes charitable donations easier has to be a good thing, I reckon.

Haha,  very true :) Reach for the stars indeed...!

You don't have to scan passports - that's future-proofing I suspect by Robocoin

I reckon that if they get enough,  they'll be hard-pressed to ignore them.  If in doubt,  point out that RNLI in the UK is already accepting and that Comic Relief are supposed to be accepting it as well next year

Maybe so, take your point. Still, I'm going to send a few smaller amounts today to see - even if it turns out that they don't want/know how to set up a Changetip account, I'm only talking about a few random 20p's (hopefully from lots of people) that doesn't represent money that would be sent to the charity by any other route. If they don't collect it, the money just gets sent back to each individual. It still helps to publicise the fact amongst the general population who'll be online today that you can transfer money simply via Twitter/Facebook using this "new Bitcoin thing". 
And if it gets stolen - I take your point but I honestly believe that the risk of theft is small here for a couple of reasons. (1) Folk working in a one-off big event like this are all pulling in the same direction (2) The donations via ChangeTip are likely to be individually be pretty small and the fact that they were offered will definitely be discussed post-event during the rundown of the social campaign which will take place in the coming week. That's partly because the donations will be a matter of public record (every mention of the charity online will be recorded and unable to be deleted once they auto-trigger a response from ChangeTip), (3) I don't think someone who knows enough about ChangeTip to want to steal the cash would honestly believe they could avoid getting caught for (probably what is in reality) a small sum of money. 
I understand what you're saying and genuinely full marks for giving bigger donations by the 'traditional' channels (think you're absolutely right to do so) - but I don't see this as a replacement for single significant donations (at this stage). It's just an additional few pennies from around the world for a very good cause that can only help - obviously in a financial sense but also (even if everything else fails and the money is rejected for some reason or taken by unscrupulous Twitter account admins) in the sense of providing more good publicity sense that helps to show Bitcoin as a force for good. 
I do, however, absolutely agree with you that this should have been thought of beforehand and official confirmation been sought from the charity that they could handle this earlier. Whoops. Hopefully though if a few people pick this up and ask them/donate small sums, the answer will come pretty quickly in any event :)

It is the Bitcoin blockchain (re Colored Coins)

OK, I'm confused. How come the second slide says they've earned more revenue than Facebook or Google in Y1 &amp; Y2 of their existence? What have I missed - how are they earning revenue today?

One who removed his card payment details from his account out of the blue five weeks ago though?

Brilliant idea, nice one More of this kind of thing pls on this subreddit folks :)

But Ripple doesn't use a blockchain does it? 
@_date: 2015-05-11 21:01:57
Reading between the lines, are you trying to say that the 51% issue isn't a problem if you know who miners actually are (ie as with a permissioned blockchain where only agreed financial institutions have the right to update the ledger, like say Eris)? That would make more sense I think (but it relates to a separate blockchain which has a totally different security profile).

Awesome! Thanks for doing this
