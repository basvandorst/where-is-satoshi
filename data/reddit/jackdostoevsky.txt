Did you pay taxes on the income you got from this? That's always been something I've been curious about, when it comes to cashing out large numbers of BTC.

While yes, nothing can grow like this forever, keep in mind: Bitcoin has yet to actually falter and stay down. I imagine that we're going to continue to see growth until it catastrophically crashes, and I imagine after it does that it won't get back up.

There's no requirement that says the data any arbitrary blockchain contains has to be bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2015-12-17 19:39:20
Disclaimer:  I could be way off-base on this and would love someone to correct me. 
As I understand it the blockchain operates a bit like Hadoop does: you have nodes operating in parallel in order to store, query, process and produce large datasets.
I remember reading/watching something that pointed out that the true genius of Bitcoin is not the currency itself, but the blockchain tech that it uses.
@_date: 2015-12-17 19:43:34
It makes perfect sense. The blockchain is just a mechanism to store data. Whether that data is bitcoin transactions or some other type of data is arbitrary.

If you search this subreddit there's actually a pretty thorough review of the kiosk. The gist of it is basically has to know EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU -- you have to create an account with the company, scan your hand, scan your state issued ID, get a picture taken, etc etc.

I use the term "protection" loosely. There are safety nets and other functions that exist to make sure the consumer doesn't lose vast amounts of money overnight. Even though, yes, fiat currency is subject to inflation over time and could lose value, there is the juggernaut of the US economy that is backing it and at least ensuring that if there is any change, changes are made gradually and over a longer period of time.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, has the very real potential for massive drops in value overnight. And that's scary to a lot of people. It's certainly stabilized in recent months, but we're still talking about this in the scale of *months*, not years or decades as you would with a currency backed by a large government and economy.

It's not smart, but at the same time, if a DNM vendor is using a brand new address for your transaction it can be far more difficult to track.
Of course, as a buyer you have no way of knowing whether the vendor is using proper opsec, so it's certainly not worth the risk.

Blocking legitimate sites' ads and replacing them with their own -- regardless of how obnoxious those original ads may or may not be -- seems rather shady to me.
Actually not *rather* shady; more like *really* shady. Say what you will about ads, it's how huge portions of the internet gets funded and stays 'free', and here we have this browser stealing ad revenue from sites?
I suppose one might say "well if you use an adblocker NOBODY gets any ad revenue," and I can understand that, but it doesn't reduce the fact that this seems a bit underhanded.
@_date: 2015-05-10 16:57:36
Krugman has forever been anti-Bitcoin. And in its own way I can kind of understand that -- there's no promise of any value attached to Bitcoin. So if you buy into Bitcoin there is no protection for the consumer if the price were to plummet tomorrow, and you could be out hundreds or thousands of dollars.
On the other hand, Krugman is so stuck in his ways that I think it's literally impossible for him to even comprehend a different way outside of the standard model of economics.

In symetric shared key encryption, the actual key is shared between two parties. This makes it ~~less secure~~ potentially less secure (when sharing data between 2+ parties), as each person who needs to decrypt the data needs to have a copy of the shared key. That adds more potential points of failure.
Pubkey encryption is one-way encryption: you have a private key, and you don't give that to *anyone*. However, when creating your private key, a public key is also generated. *This* is the key you give to people -- they can then use the public key you've given them to encrypt data they send you. Nobody but you (with your private key) can decrypt the data, making it far more secure.
I hope that cleares things up!
EDIT: Also worth pointing out is that in symmetric encryption, the same key is used for encryption as is used for decryption. There's basically only 1 key ever involved, which is why in many applications pubkey encryption is preferred.
Symmetric encryption works better when you're not not sharing data between parties, such as when you're encrypting your hard drives or anything else that *only you* have access to.
EDIT2: For reference.

Impromptu question: I just use a VPS in order to forward traffic on to my mail server at home, basically as a remote firewall so my home IP isn't visible to the world. If I were to use Momento for this, would I need to request a whitelist for the VPS to forward SMTP traffic via iptables?

Not a huuuuuge fan of the color analogy. I personally feel that a simple lock-and-key analogy works a bit better:
    Symmetric encryption is like a traditional lock-and-key -- you have a
    lock, and you have a single key that unlocks it. Each person who needs
    to unlock that door will need to have the same key.

This is disturbing news to me, as I just paid for my second month at Linode and I've been extremely happy with their service. Of course, I only use the VPS as an OpenVPN gateway / firewall for my home server (and a remote irssi machine), and I don't store private keys on it (which now I've decided is a good idea), but I'm not such a big fan of this news. :(
I had a VPS with [MomentoVPS]( which can be paid for with Bitcoins, but they unfortunately do not allow SMTP servers. Of course, if I'm going to be forwarding traffic with iptables I might as well just use that...

This article really lost me at this point due to the fact that this is flat out false. You simply have to replace "U.S. government office" with "bank."


No, you didn't. Sure, the government can print more money, but when you go to work and 'make money,' you are not producing money that didn't already exist -- the person who pays you no longer has the money that they give to you for working, and the money that *they* have is given to them by customers who purchase an item / service, and then *they* no longer have that money, etc etc.
About half of what this guy is saying actually matters or means anything. Saying 'printing money doesn't cause hyperinflation' is like saying 'guns don't kill people' without the conditional '... unless they're wielded by someone with the intent to kill.' The point is, printing money *does* cause hyperinflation, just like guns kill people *when they are pointed at someone and fired.*
And that's the entire gist of this article -- it's half-truths combined with a Devil's Advocate approach to a system that seems to only be partially comprehended. There are some good points -- such as, one breach of the bitcoin security could spell disaster for the whole thing -- but there are other points -- such as it being an online-only currency -- that really do not matter in the slightest to what bitcoin is.
In the end, I get the feeling that this author is one of the many people I've talked to who don't feel comfortable with bitcoin because, by investing in it, it represents a risk that puts them on edge -- mostly embodied in the 'what gives bitcoins value?' question.
@_date: 2011-06-16 19:18:05
This is the  issue I have with explaining Bitcoins to others. As soon as I mention the fact that you can mine coins on your computer -- and that mining is how coins are seeded to the world -- combined with the current value of the coins, they immediately turn on mining in the client.
And no matter how hard I try to explain it, they do not understand how long it would take to mine coins.
@_date: 2011-07-01 15:49:52
I wasn't aware that difficulty *could* go down. I thought the difficulty of mining was tied directly to the amount of bitcoins that exist, ie, the more *coins* you mine, the higher the difficulty goes, and that it wasn't elastic.
Please correct me if I'm wrong!
@_date: 2011-05-15 03:25:40
Oh come on. The thumbnail.
@_date: 2011-10-10 17:36:44
The reason for the decline is pretty straightforward: hype was generated and tons of people began mining tons of coins. And that's all well and good, if you can maintain that hype.
However, there are two things that happened (which are pretty closely related):
* The number of people who started buying / trading / mining Bitcoins in the spring far outstripped the rate at which companies began accepting them, thereby decreasing the practical value of owning them
* People frankly seem to have gotten bored with Bitcoins, or the novelty wore off, or the perceived value of Bitcoins dramatically decreased. All three of those things contributed to the others, and there was a massive falloff of interested users.
That being said, I think that $4-$5 / coin is a fine price for it to stay at. There's value and worth in a currency maintaining a value and not fluctuating up and done wildly like it did earlier this year. It gives businesses more incentive to accept them, because they know that if they accept a coin at $30 one day, that it won't be worth half that the next.

Bitcoin is a currency that is being traded as a commodity.
@_date: 2011-06-21 18:45:39
The problem here is not MtGox, it's the bitcoin community's reliance on MtGox as a standard.
BTC is supposed to be anonymous; it is, when you take the proper precautions. The issue comes from the general idea that we need to have a centralized system with which to standardize the price. This was a mistake.
But can anyone really be blamed for that? I know I fell into the trap. MtGox was reporting $30 per coin, and everyone had $$ in their eyes. Of course people were attracted to that and wanted to have a piece of that.
Here's what should happen instead:
If people require a standard value -- and we do, we really do -- we need to take an average of all the latest buy / sell values at a catalog of exchanges. So if we have half a dozen decently sized exchanges, then take the average price bought / sold between all of them as a standard.
The problem comes from *using an exchange as a standard.* It would make more sense to use a separate entity that uses an autonomous method (ie, averages of functioning exchanges) that can exist beyond the existence of the organization / website that reports the standard.
@_date: 2011-04-30 17:10:06
This is most definitely a bubble. Anyone who thinks this *isn't* a bubble simply isn't paying attention.
The fact is that the current price of BTC, based on the Mt Gox price, is purely based on speculative trading, not supply and demand as it relates to buying and selling of merchandise via bitcoins.
Basically, bitcoins are currently being traded as commodities, not as currency, and that is a major roadblock in acceptance of BTC as a legitimate currency that's accepted by a large range of merchants.

This just relates to MyBitcoin, not to the bitcoin client that you download and run on your computer.
That can be used or modified to your heart's content. However you wouldn't want to anyway, as any changes to the way that the client processes blocks will result in your blocks being rejected by the network.
One of the main reasons to do your processing -- ie, your wallet -- on your own computer, not on someone else's computer.
If you really want to have a remotely accessible wallet, you might consider buying a cheap VPS (you can buy one with bitcoins) and running the client there.

This is an interesting concept but not a very good article. In no way does this explain how Bitcoins would be a better vessel for these payments than normal dollars, and in no way is there describe a mechanism for these payments to take place.

To be fair, the hyperbole of the title doesn't match the content of the article.
I think a fair issue that most people have when confronted with Bitcoin is the idea of what exactly it's purpose is. Hell, I think Bitcoin, as an entity, still isn't entirely sure.
Is it a commodity like gold? Is it a vessel for which people should pay for services, with fiat currency (ie, a replacement for PayPal)? Or is it a currency that is destined to replace fiat currency such as the USD, GBP, Yen or Euro?
I personally feel that the second option -- Bitcoin purely as a method of transferring fiat currencty -- is the closest to realistic.
@_date: 2013-12-29 07:50:15
I think this is delusional thinking. I'm not saying Bitcoin is bad (or "evil," as Krugman's article posits) and I think it's a very good thing. I just don't think that Bitcoin has the ability to be everything that everyone on wants it to be, and the big stopping point is that it simply doesn't have the *volume* to replace currencies such as the USD, Euro, etc.
However, I would earnestly like to hear your opinion on this, or why you think that a currency that can have, at maximum, 21 trillion discrete units, can replace world currencies, or be anything more than a niche currency for online purchases (regardless of the item purchased).
