Yes! Corporations do not commit 'crimes.' They make 'mistakes' caused by 'misunderstandings,' which is good because then 'lessons can be learned.'
'Crimes' are committed by plebs like us.

[Mullvad]( provide an excellent service;
* range of payment options including cash, bitcoin, credit card,
* buy 1 day to 1 year ($7/€5 per month),
* Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iPhone/iPad compatible,
* one account valid on 3 devices,
* easy to use client or nice plain OpenVPN,
* option to block internet if connection lost, and
* solid privacy policy (if you believe it). 
We've used them for a year or so with no regrets.

This article is poorly written and contains formatting/spelling mistakes. The content lacks depth and makes claims which are not followed up with references. I was disappointed because I like reading informative articles about bitcoin. But it's shit. 
If this comment hurts your feelings just ignore me. I am a middle-aged, overweight pleb with a passing interest in bitcoin, privacy, the internet and cryptography ... i.e. I know nothing. People actually laugh at me when I walk past them.

Heh heh, you're right but **welcome to Reddit**.

They go by two or three names. Run by a self-confessed horse-fucker and cocaine smuggler, IIRC. We used them for a while but found their customer support to be surly and uncommunicative. There was a bit of a stink in the forum regarding logs. While they claimed there were no logs, a moderator threatened to ban and dox anyone he caught indulging in the most heinous of all internet crimes. When pressed regarding just how he would do this with no logs, he became evasive. The thread went on and on, descended into flaming from the mods and ended unsatisfactorily. Took our business elsewhere when the owner was later busted with a ton of cocaine (again) but then quietly released without charge. I miss reading the owner's forum entries regarding his, er, proclivities. He went into quite a lot of detail regarding the process of ejaculating inside farm animals. Man, he really had a way with words. You had to keep reading all the way to the end. 
TL;DR: Honestly it's a mess. Stay away. 
Edit: Spelling.

Heh heh. No need to get mad bro. Just down-vote and move on.

I would go the other way. Think of something your colleagues want. Offer to sell it to them for BTC. If you can't think of anything, offer to demean yourself. Refuse to give any information except for your Bitcoin address. If they're of the right persuasion to adopt a crypto-currency they will enjoy the learning experience. If they're not, you will have trouble getting them to stick with it even if you lead them by the nose. 
Whatever you do, don't forget to post a follow-up!

Perhaps I am missing your issue (I have personally used only their Windows GUI and Linux plain OpenVPN) ... but I only see *Get started* &gt; *iPhone / iPad* &gt; *Enter your customer ID* or *Create a new account*. As I understand it, creating a new account generates your customer ID, which you need to pay with once the free trial is up (i.e. you don't enter any information).
