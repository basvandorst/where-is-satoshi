The answer lies within the very definition and "mission statement" of BitCoin - a true decentralized, deregulated, free market currency. It's a free game for everyone - the minute an exchange would impose "taxes" on specific traders, or trading behaviour, it's a slippery slope to a regulated market.
Also - what would prevent other exchanges from opening an exchange with lower fees? The traders would just move there.
We need to accept High Frequency Trading, *build exchanges that can handle that load", and deal with it. Exactly like real stock exchanges.

Maybe. Maybe not. 
It's one order. It means nothing. You can't deduce anything long-term from short-term behaviour.

The spend the absolute minimum they have to - bare necessities. 
It makes a big difference for the economy. Think about restaurants, movie theaters, tourism... all leisure activity would be "postponed".

When you really really want to sell, you post a message saying exactly  this.
People - if you're holding BTC, close this forum and go do *your own* analysis of the situation, and then decide to buy/hold/sell. Every message you see here has interests behind it, which might not align with yours.

You're absolutely right - there's no reason for you to get down voted.
This is exactly why deflation is considered much more dangerous than inflation - it gives people no reason to go and spend their money ("it will be worth more tomorrow"), economies come to an halt, and suddenly - recession.

Yes. There is a chance. There is also a chance of them increasing. 
No one on this forum has any credible, objective opinion about the situation. Don't listen to anyone - think for yourself, consider you risks, and take action. Or don't.

Really? If you had 1 BTC, and you had two options - going to a movie (and pay BitCoin) or wait for a month, exchange to $ and buy 5 movie tickets, you wouldn't wait?
I would.
