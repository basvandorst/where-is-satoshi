Problem is selling, huge amounts of money coming into your account. That's what they don't like.

I need to know this for myself lol. I know Fidor bank is apparently crypto-friendly but they're in Germany!

If you're in the UK, Barclays and HSBC are on the "naughty" list.

They permanently closed my bank without any notice or reason as to why it happened. They were my favourite :(

They said they legally do not have to provide me with any reason as to why they closed my account. My advice is withdraw very slowly and not lump sums at a time.

They have sent me a letter saying they will not reconsider my proposal to reopen my bank account. :/

My parents keep telling me to sell all of my assets because they strongly believe cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin is illegal. Can anyone explain with sources as to how it is legal in the UK?

Bitshares is booming and it's not even close to full potential, and it's booming because of exchanges like Coinbase.

Hi everyone. I'd like to talk about an issue which has been floating around in my mind for a while now. What would happen if a (or all) government(s) decided to make the trading and usage of Bitcoin illegal? I know they cannot physically touch the Bitcoin network (as in freeze accounts and what not), but would that cause a crash that we won't be able to recover from or what? How would we go about this? Thank you :)

I wouldn't mind a copy too please if you don't mind. I appreciate it :)

Current account blocked and under review for involvement with Bitcoin. They are definitely afraid of a future where people simply don't need banks anymore!

That actually makes perfect sense, interesting. The federal reserve is the main culprit that's messing everything up!

I guess that makes sense, but I think when that happens the alt season would definitely be in play.

Where can I find this? I have that Gear 3 watch and it'll be pretty cool to have one!

Hope you have patience and a good internet connection! Good luck lol

My personal short-ish term prediction. I still believe 50k by end of this year.

Fantastic artwork. You should make a mobile wallpaper version! I have the S8 fyi... ;)

Once whales/sellers have depleated all of their selling assets, there wont be much left but buyers. And all these buyers competing for the small amount of BTC readily available to buy on markets would be enough reason to drive the price up.

I believe $50,000 is achievable.
