Coinbase/GDAX.  I've used it twice within the last month and both times the money has been in my account (Wells Fargo) the next day.  They warn it can take up to 5, but 1 day has been my experience.

Have you seen the price of GPUs lately?  Used 1080/70/60s are being sold for twice MSRP of new ones.  Buying GPUs and mining is not a good idea right now, which sucks because I need to upgrade my aging 6950 for gaming too.

When you trade on an exchange, nothing ever hits the blockchain.  The coins stay in the exchange wallet and they just update your account on the server.  The coins aren't actually "yours" until you withdraw.

Most USD payments happen via credit/debit which I believe are 3% at a minimum.  The fee is borne by the merchant and baked into the price of goods, so you never see it.

I purchase with my credit card because Wells Fargo insists on cancelling the transactions for "fraud protection" and I have to call them whereas my BofA credit card just sent me a text the first time asking if I authorized the transaction and hasn't tried to stop me since.  I pay the card off as soon as I make the purchase.

At least BofA just sends me a text asking if I authorized the transaction and if I reply yes they remove the block and it goes through if I resibmit.  Whole process takes a couple of mins max and they didn't even do it last time I bought.

Have you tried?  Coinbase gives you the option of "photo ID" and a passport is a legal identification document in the US.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:36:45
Coinbase isn't buying your bitcoins..  Coinbase is selling your BTC to other users of Coinbase who have deposited money with them.
If there's no one to buy them because no one has any money or is willing to spend it, your bitcoins are worthless.  That's called a market crash.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:54:30

I use my BofA credit card and pay it off immediately.  The first two times I bought, the transaction was initially declined but their automated system sent me a text asking me to verify it and when I did, it went through the next time.  I've bought $1500 in the last week and they did not even send me a verification text.

I'm aiming for a $10k used XTerra.  Can't offroad a Lambo/Tesla, though a Model 3 or whatever their entry-level offering is might be nice eventually.
I can probably come up with the $10k by end of next year with various amounts of investment, but the problem is I'm not going to want to sell when I get there.  Maybe I can drop $10k when I'm worth $30-$40k.
Beyond that, let it grow let it grow let it grow!

They don't make it clear, but at least when that was happening to me, it was my bank declining the transaction.  I eventually got a text from them asking if I authorized the transactions (Bank of America), I replied yes, and all transactions after that have gone through fine.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:41:23

I don't see BTC going away at this point as it's already survived at least one major event that I unfortunately thought would be the death of it.  Limited supply all but guarantees a continuous rise in price.  I'd compare it to gold.

Unless he has dedicated hardware it's cheaper just to buy them

It's ok.  Left nut is still going to be eaten
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:08:32
Never mind apparently I was wrong

I invested at a previous all time high of $7400 and have made ~$50 in the past 2 weeks.

Maybe I misunderstood you.  On second thought, scanning the QR code probably doesn't let someone steal the bitcoins, because posting that on the internet would be a colossally stupid idea.
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:50:46
So... scan it tomorrow?

By that logic, no one should ever buy a car.

Step 1: Buy bitcoin
Step 2: Hodl bitcoin

Kickbacks from traditional banks/investment institutions?

I found my old wallet.dat buried inside a disk image I made of my old laptop that I still had stored on my server for some reason, unfortunately it confirmed I had sold every last BTC I had :(

I asked my dad if he knew what Bitcoin was the other day, he said it was "some internet money thing that keeps going up and up and up."  Yet he still has no plans to ever buy any.

I started incesting about 2 weeks ago and have made over 20%.  Does that answer your question?
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:20:59
Yeah.  My dumb ass got out after the Mt. Gox hack, kicking myself for it all the time

Pretty sure there's at least one person in Russia who's doing that

If they've invested more than they can stand to lose, they'll be in trouble

The value of the item minus the price you paid originally for the BTC originally.  Spending BTC is considered cashing out your profits.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:48:53
Yes, because 18th/19th century industrialism was the height of civilization! /s

I'm sure there are a lot of other people thinking the same thing.  Why not just deal with the slight inconvenience of buying small amounts now (I figured it out yesterday) instead of waiting?  More accessible = more buyers = increase in value.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:48:48
Personally I hope it's got at least one more good crash left in it
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:51:20
A few years ago I sold roughly 8 bitcoins I mined for $800 :(

$5,000 bag?  My car cost me less than that...

Always recovers higher and eclipses the old high in a year or two.

I'm using the Android wallet right now, it was simple enough to set up but I don't remember the specific process.
The only issue I had was that I had to replay the transaction to get my IOTA to show up after I withdrew them from Binance.  I didnt even know what replaying the transaction was before then so I freaked out a bit that I had just lost my money.
Things like that are going to be a hurdle to long term adoption if they keep up.

You're better off using that $1k to buy bitcoins unless you get free electricity.  Less risk than mining, not more, IMO.
