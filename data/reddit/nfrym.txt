I'm just saving your investments.
Do you honestly think we need Ethereum? XRP have those capabilities already. And it won't be dead with Cryptokitties. And Ripple can upgrade their technology whenever, whatever, whichever. They see all those coins having those superpowers whatever they can easily upgrade their technology and offer it to banks. Guess what, corporations will use the technology approved by banks.
Do you honestly think that we need IOTA? A data marketplace that can also be implemented without using blockchain. 
I'm just saving you guys. Dont get left behind. People can blow up this coin upto millions but whatever lol. XRP will eat those gains easily.

Sell your BTC. Buy XRP. Downvote me all the way but BTC is a failed ship. You didn't get the banks, you guys didn't get the regulator, you guys have a major issue in transaction speed, costs, and capacity.
Segwit is already here for like months already and not all of you supported it. You think when LN comes out you guys gonna support it? 
Bitcoin have failed. Bitcoin can't close the banks. Accept that fact. Sell it now or you're going to regret it once the whales started selling. You guys will be the one punished.
You notice why there's a lot of donations lately? Tax reductions my friends. The whales are going out the party. Don't get left behind. 
Focus on whats happening. New money is being created and you're going to buy a crypto that is not being adopted by banks. I don't know about you, but you guys can't see whats going on. The banks already got their choice. This ship will fail. You notice why Satoshi dont want the money? Because he's afraid that he invented the biggest bubble in history.
LN, Bitcoin Cash, etc. All have failed already. Ripple is the clear winner they got all of Japan. You dont want to ignore Japan btw. Japan is huge and I bet your ass that other countries will pay Japan with XRP if they want it.
Don't sit there romanticizing that banks fail. We need banks, we need governments, we need those guys to function.
And BTW, supposed BTC flourished 10-20 years from now. What ? You gonna power it using the whole SUN? Bitcoin is designed to fail. And do you notice why Satoshi doens't want the money? Because he's afraid that he created the biggest bubble in history. 
Dont be late selling your coins. Go sell it and buy XRP.

You won't be able to say that because it will go to 0
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:24:48
Because it's the entry point if you want to buy other coins. That's all. But that will change and it won't be special anymore. Just faith by some believers that bank isn't needed anymore. Lol

Ok. but you are sure that he's safe right?

What happens if a lot of people begins to cash out?
@_date: 2013-02-01 13:43:26
Where can you spend your bitcoins? There's few people accepting bitcoins now..
@_date: 2013-02-01 13:46:41
If you have millions of dollars then you can prevent another bitcoin recession.
The problem with bitcoin is its not "cash". its an investment. so most people want to cash out someday.

Thanks for the advice. I plan to use the escrow rather than losing my money. What is the fee for the escrow?
