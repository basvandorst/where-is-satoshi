OpenBazaar is an awesome idea but it should be implemented in Ethereum line Augur did. OpenBazaar team is doing a lot of heavy double work which would be solved with Ethereum in few lines of eth code (decentralization, p2p protocol,...).

download a SAFE copy of electrum or multibit or vanitygen and put it on a usb stick.
boot your pc with a CLEAN live linux usb - NEVER connect to the internet in it!!!
run electrum or multibit or vanitygen
generate pub+priv key and copy them in a text file and save this textfile into a truecrypt volume encrypted with secure password. 
copy this truecrypt volume onto 5 different locations. 3 usbs sticks geographcally separated and 2 cd/dvd media. Done.
Use the pub key to send your savings to.
