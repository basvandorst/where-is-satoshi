What do you mean? Its a delivery service, no canned food. Pizza, burgers, steaks, salads from pretty much all restaurants that do delivery in your region

You gotta be stupid to claim the USD is worthless. Pretty sure the majority of this sub doesn‘t see it as worthless

I live in germany and I trust my government
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:55:58
Wait what?
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:24:10
That makes no sense
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:09:59
Get a grip
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:43:07
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:18:10
Thats not necessarily a good thing
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:30:30
Wanted to argue but then saw your posts on r/the_donald lmao
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:47:57
No I mean you would easily be able to sell it
@_date: 2018-05-08 12:15:51
Right, we redditors know what we‘re talking about tho!
@_date: 2018-05-13 08:58:33
This is some r/IAmVerySmart shit
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:32:33
Kind of a newb so Ill drop this question right here. What would happen if a powerfull country just bans cryptocurrencies, declaring them as illegal? Wouldnt that pretty much kill it?
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:44:37
I mean, declaring it illegal would already devalue bitcoin extreme no?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:41:14
Wait this not r/getrichquick ?
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:04:55
Well thats what it wants to be though. And if it only stays a „good“ then it would die
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:33:51
Im a newb but wouldn‘t that have extreme consequences if it is declared illegal? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:10:24
like I said, its always up until its not

Do some research on paper wallets and how to create one. I use the desktop Wallet electrum personally
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:27:56
72 btw
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:47:52
What a fucking noob
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:37:37
Try litebit.eu
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:40:05
litebit bruh
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:23:53
I mean I know you guys here don‘t like the bubble talk but don‘t be mad if someone says I told you so in case it happens. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:08:21
damn that sucks, good luck tho, keep trying
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:54:44
Make up your own decision. And don‘t ask this in bitcoin subreddits as most will obviously tell you to do it. Not saying its wrong but you know

I bought at 300 on a stock simulator-app ��
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:26:09
I don‘t know but I guess they would have to take pretty high fees to make it worthwile. I saw an article speculating that by then mining could also be way more effective that already low fees could make decent profit
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:38:38
May the dippin' beginn
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:07:10
Its always up, until its not
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:18:44
He is not discrediting 
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:56:30
I honestly think they could be somewhere entirely different today if they embraced the „bcash“ term and if they weren‘t leeching off of bitcoins reputation so hard.

You‘re calling yourself that „talent“, could I ask what classifies as a talent in the IT world? Serious question, I barely know anything about programming
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:45:28
Oh free money?
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:02:28
Not really a bad thing to be careful tbh. I get your point tho
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:39:47
Is that all assumption or factual?
@_date: 2018-04-22 06:15:14
So what are the choices?
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:06:15
They wouldn‘t go on reddit and tease that place lol. 
This just sounds like a fantasy
@_date: 2018-04-21 21:24:00
And where is that
@_date: 2018-04-21 21:19:24
Agreed, 99% of „users“ would just drop it. Just like most people will stop at a red light even in the fucking desert
@_date: 2018-04-28 12:39:04
What is bitcoin core
@_date: 2018-04-29 11:28:01
You do?
@_date: 2018-04-29 11:32:00
Please stop. The people do bow down to their countries.
@_date: 2018-04-21 21:21:36
Thats what you would leave your country for? ��
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:06:33
Someone who held since &lt;32$ has nothing better to do than posting on reddit ? ��
@_date: 2018-04-21 21:22:12
Elaborate on serious issues
