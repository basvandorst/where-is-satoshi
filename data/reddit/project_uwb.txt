Would you mind if I created a post and referred users to your faucet for their first lighting airdrop?

This is a brilliant website.. Got me a few sats just liking and following. Although a lot of the actions to follow don't pay out. Says 'try again later'. Anyone else ha e the same issue?

I am interested too but agreed $300 is too much atm to play with. I wish there was something a bit cheaper. DIY solution without too much technical configuration. Even the other box pointed out in the reply is $250!! Let me know if there is something that I can achieve with an old laptop that I have?

Sounds super cool.. So I tried to got to the website on my mobile but looks like this for the desktop with Chrome. Can anyone confirm if it's actually free to play? Or do I need to bet sats to play?

Sounds really cool.. I am just starting to come up with an idea of having a website set up. Can I use this service in my website to get lightning payments? Would be great if there is a dummies guide on how to do this. Any links welcome.

Agree but I want is to atleast explain some simple concepts of money. They are already getting educated about the fiat system at school. So I would like to keep them informed on alternatives is all.
