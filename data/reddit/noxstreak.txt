actually his income is from affiliate rewards.  Probablly gets a % of bets you place on site you use through the affiliate links of his.  Good system!
That being said Tips are fine no one is forcing people to pay for the content.  But say he gives great advice on a horse race and some makes 100k using his betting strat.  That person may be happy to tip as a way of saying thanks on top of using an affiliate link from him.

Start a business and accept bitcoin!  I am not a super programmer but I am trying to setup a business and accept bitcoin in order to help it grow.  Its also a great learning experience and though scary at times, really fun!
Find something you enjoy and sell it.  There may be others selling it for BTC already but adding competition helps the economy grow.
Try to work with vendors that accept bitcoin and get your stock from those vendors, even if it cost a bit more.  I am trying to create a closed loop system but only managed to get about 60% of my vendors to use btc.

I recently updated to win 8 and my games framerate has drop for league.   I have been playing with driver but still it will stall at random.  I also use three screens but win 7 never had issues with gaming.  
I honestly think it may be windows driver overwriting Nvidia drivers.  I turned off auto updating but I checked this morning and it switched it back to the windows driver.  
I love the UI in Win 8.  The keyboard shortcuts are genius.

Have a bitcoin domain that would work for it as an affiliate

But it can be burned/stolen with no way of getting it back.  If someone robs my savings account the feds pay it back to me.  I think we need to get some insurance before people will actually put there worth into bitcoins.

Actually Linux may be/become one of the least safe out there if it gets associated with bitcoins.  As it does not have the world as beta testers and tons of companies looking for holes like windows does it is at a serious disadvantage. 
I remember reading that for a long time linux had a bug that showed the shadow password that could have been used for years to break into systems (Still looking for source).  
Paper wallets may be the only solution but who knows.
TL:DR&gt;Linux is not safe just because we do not know about the holes in the system.

Want an easy one?
MTGO (magic teh gathering online
Code an app that read the data from the program then querys the card value in a database (many out there).  In the program put the cards value on top the of card so the player no longer has the manually search through the database. Sell for 3 bucks a pop.  you will get 10-20k I bet.  Been holding onto this idea for a bit but to lazy to increase my coding ability.

Ads probably.  He has the traffic.... I am surprised there is not BFL ad like every other site.  Hopefully it will be a good company perhaps coinbase would sponsor him

Hmm you really need to have rack rental by the hour or day.  Sometimes I just need a bit of time to test out some commands.
Also plans for VOIP or CCSE?  I only rent racks when I need to study on phone systems or firewalls.  Switching and routing can be handled by Vms.
Good luck on your business!

If they bought 11 million at an average of $100 they would have 110k BTC.  There is only 30k in buy orders on bitstamp before the price drops to 0.
They could destroy the market in an instant (though it would come back)
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:36:22
Looks good!  Do you have an affiliate program?

Really like the layout and images on your blog!  Is this wordpress and if so what theme?
@_date: 2013-09-30 20:12:15
Good idea.  Not sure if you will get enough players.  I mean I can bet on myself but it does not matter unless someone on there team bets on themselves.  The odds of that happening are very slim I would guess.

Not sure why downvote... These sites are run by one or maybe two people trying to build a business.  This time of year everyone is doing family time.  Does it suck... yes.  Did the owners drop the ball... not really.  No website is perfect and unhackable

That freaking hub only could handle 4 miners with my fan.  Pissed me off!  If you want my old one ill send it to you (pay shipping).  
Ended up buy the Gearmo 10 port hub (now sold out)
Amazon does have the [7 port hub]( in stock though.

Jeez the manufacturer gets a piece?  Was 20k not enough....  I cannot wait for competition in this market.
@_date: 2013-05-08 20:02:36
Question: Won't this flood the market with bitcoins and make the price drop?
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:49:44
Could you lower the min amount from .1 to .01?

I am to late to the party...  Shares are way expensive.
@_date: 2013-11-08 03:20:48
I do not think so.  The game itself can run a really small server and handle 1000+ people.  Dont program set amount of gold for each mob but program it take a percentage of the pool.  Also it charges for transactions between players/ vendors.  Should be more then enough to fund the server/game.  It really all depends on how many players you get.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:51:00
Would you consider opening up a coinbase merchant account.  My understanding is no fees for the first million.
@_date: 2013-05-08 22:35:08

I would love to offer my services for bitcoins but as an IT guy the people that use bitcoin already have these skills themselves.  I have been trying to find something I could offer over the internet for bitcoins.  Plus most my skills are only really valuable to businesses and they will continue to pay in fiat.

Ooo I contacted OgNasty as he is listed in the bitcointalk thread.  Its been 6 days of constant PMs.  Ill try nonnakip and let you know.

I really like the guy.  He is honest giving the good and the bad.  Glad he is doing it.

Under your account you click add funds and bitcoin is an option!
@_date: 2013-05-08 17:25:53
And this is exactly what I am worried about.  No system is truly safe unless its off the internet but then it opens it to things like fire and other natural things.
The only way I would use bitcoins for everything (including savings) is if it was insurable. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 03:13:31
I would think it would be pretty easy to do.  I mean maybe 100-200 man hours for an alpha.  Making it secure would be a whole other issue.
@_date: 2013-10-28 20:33:39
Will you offer affiliates?  perhaps give each affiliate 5% of rev they generate for you by selling to small businesses.  This could really boost sales. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 23:03:56

I am always impressed by artists.  They have a gift for seeing things that I cannot.  Its always weird for me to look at a piece of art and figure out how they came up with it.  I always look for a formula but I am pretty sure there is none.  When you create stuff do you have the total image in mind or does each stroke just continue the design that has yet to be completed?
Really cool and I hope you continue your art work! 
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:48:54
Is the API part of the merchant deal?  I was looking to add bitcoins as a payment for a new website through coinbase as WHMCS supports it..

Just Called to confirm that they took btc. The guy who answered did not know what bitcoin was :).  Gave a quick explination.  Got a call back 5 minutes later saying they do take its just the staff did not know how.  
Do you know what system they are using?
