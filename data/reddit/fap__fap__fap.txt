You might want to edit that this wasn't a credit check, as you mentioned in your deleted thread.

I know, I was just trying to provide resource for others in the future.  Seems you have already gotten sorted out.  I was also hoping someone would point out something I missed.

Explain to me how Escrow is a scam?  Coins are held by a mutually agreed 3rd party, as opposed to prepaid preorder like BFL.

In that case I would argue that it wasn't morals that got changed, but economics.  You calculated the marginal benefit (what you had to gain) of the 2 million, vs the marginal cost (what you had to lose) of sucking a dick.
It would be comparable to having a job shoveling elephant shit.  Would I do it for $5 an hour? No.  Would I do it for $50 an hour?  Certainly.  I haven't changed my morals so much as seeing what I had to gain from compromising on my dislikes.  There are plenty of girls and guys who would not suck a dick for $1,000, for $10,000, for 100,000.  I think that is very valiant, but not in line with my moral perspective in the face of economics.
This question is very similar in an odd way to an AskReddit question, [How many days would you let someone pee on you for $300 a day?](

Picking your nose is in no way considered immoral.  It is generally considered frowned upon in our culture and geographic region, specifically in the presence of others.  Would you interfere with the rights of individuals to pick their nose in their free time?  Lets say that a community of people enjoy watching others pick their noses, would you be opposed to the nose pickers sharing their actions with the watchers?  What if the watchers supported the pickers efforts monetarily?
My ethical principle is that if the parties engaged in the action do no harm to others and are mutually consenting, then I have no reason to be opposed to their actions, no matter how strange they may seem to me.
For me girlsgonebitcoin and the anonymity bitcoin offers are a good thing, as it enables consenting adults to engage in a transaction without fears of repercussion, and prevents both parties from gaining more than consented by finding out personal information through payment gateways.

Fastest to slowest imo:
[gyft]( for various gift cards, instant through bitpay.
[bitcoinsaresexy]( for cheap Amazon gift cards or expensive paypal (3% + Paypal fees), started by a redditor, take a while to email sometimes (6-24 hours in my experience).
[campbx]( for an exchange that complies with Fincen and works with Dwolla.
[localbitcoins]( for face to face transactions, with 1% escrow.

In regards to ASICs and FPGAs, the memory requirements make this not true, at least in regards to hardware.  GPUs are already very close to the optimum device to mine scrypt, as they combine fast memory with lots of stream processors.
FPGAs for bitcoin were already a stop gap, not better $/hash, just better from an energy standpoint.  Add in an additional memory requirement and FPGAs are out.
ASICs have the same issues, the reason they work for bitcoin is the lack of need for anything other than a few logic gates, an internet connection, and some power.  Scrypt was specifically designed to make ASICs unfeasible, and this is discussed at some length in the scrypt white paper.
The reason many people support Litecoin, at least from the perspective of a miner, is that it seems to be more decentralized in a way than Bitcoin.  If you want to be competitive in the Litecoin mining environment, buy a 7850 for $150, and you will have the same $/hash as the people who are buying the 7950, the current standard at $300.  Also, as it is consumer hardware, it has a value outside of bitcoin, and is a lower barrier to entry for the average Joe to support the network.
We are coming fully into a time where the only way to support the Bitcoin network in a meaningful way is to buy an ASIC, a device with no value without Bitcoin, except perhaps to crack a very small subset of passwords.  Also as a miner you are now competing with corporations who are contracting out their own ASIC designs, and their own chip manufacturing processes, often on the backs and investments of the current miners who support the network.
For better or worse, Bitcoin is getting a lot more corporate, and there is a reason ASICs not unilaterally accepted as a good thing.  While you buy 5 GH and hope a company will come through, someone else is working on getting 45nm technology chips working through private deals with a major chipmaker, making your 5 GH slowly into an insignificant brick overshadowed by a corporate server farm, laughing all the way to the bank.
