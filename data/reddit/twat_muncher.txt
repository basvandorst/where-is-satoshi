Am i the only one on here who thinks trump mentioning bitcoin is because he has drawn up additional regulation surrounding it?

Ah lucky you I used blockchain.info and can see exactly how much all my bitcoins are worth in today's money lol

It is NOT QE, I promise.
-Trump and Powell, who criticized Obama for QE.

Right and then as soon as October-December 2018 happened it was decided we need to inject financial cocaine into the markets

He was probably going based off Trump's campaign trail where he shit all over Obama for having zero interest rate policy and quantitative easing, yet those are the exact tools hes using to falsely prop up the stock market today...
If Trump did what he said, we would have had a recession by now, rather than Q2 or Q3 of 2020.
I mean look at that 180 he pulled, lmao.

So you are in yet you believe the mainstream financial journalism talking points?
I believe we are in a recession, but no one has said the R word yet. And I also think we will be back to 0% interest rates very soon. They won't raise rates again before they drop to zero.

This is what I'm referring to as "not QE" because Powell insisted this isn't QE

It took 3 years to get a new all time high from the $1200 bubble, so I would imagine it easily goes down to $2000 again before we break $20,000

I'm tired of this bitcoin hodler permabull religion we have going on. There's zero TA, zero DD, zero logic here over half the time. How do I know? I was a bitcoin evangelicalist when it hit the peak of $266 in one of the first few bull runs, and the exact same posts are still posted to this god damn subreddit 7/8 years later.
Also I just made 80% off a June expiring Gold call option in the last week, so you can profit 30% when the underlying asset goes up 1%, where is the standardized options on bitcoin?

We know, healthy means continuing the bitcoin bubble pattern of 30x rises every 4 years, this isn’t the TD ameritrade subreddit lmao

Seeing my old 10, 20 BTC transactions to those stupid dice addresses makes me sad

There was zero new interest in bitcoin this was simply whales manipulating the price, welcome to 2014 bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:12:26
Lmao it’s not going to go up for another 2 years mate look at the pattern
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:16:35
Bro, yes, you can store bitcoin on paper with a pencil
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:13:51
