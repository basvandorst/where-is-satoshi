What do you mean by real money?  It is all pretty fake and contrived, whether it be a piece of paper or a number in a banking computer.

It's dropping in price a lot, and pretty unstable.  Probably less than 20% of Americans have any bitcoin at all, and even less use it on a daily basis.
Apple pay, on the other hand, is taking off.  You can use it at a lot of kiosks, and it is really cool to just swipe your phone instead of having to slide a payment card, whether is be a visa one or a bitcoin one.

As long as there is lots of volatility there is tons of money to be made.

Same, once it hits 2k it's game on!  Till then, sell sell sell sell... it will only keep dropping.

Cause people file bankruptcy and they get burned!  I'd borrow a ton of money to make a bet if I didn't have to pay it back if I lost.

I agree.. waiting till 2 to buy again.

Bitcoin is here to stay, don't worry.  Just wait till it gets around 2k to buy again.

Telling people to buy the dip is asking them to throw away their money.  It is both selfish and irresponsible.  Bitcoin will go back to around 2k, where it belongs, and will able to be used as a CURRENCY again.  People with common sense will buy then.

God this guy is clueless.  Now is exactly the time to short it, it hasn't even started to drop yet, it will hit 2k again soon.

What is the song you used for the background music?  Sounds pretty awesome.

It's not FUD, it's the bubble draining.  Should start to stabilize around 5k, what it should be worth.
@_date: 2018-02-01 05:56:44
I am pretty sure it will hit 5 before it goes on another run.  Basically they were bought in mass by people when it was getting a ton of attention, on the news, Saturday Night Live, online blogs and newspapers, and this made it overvalued.  It will get back to earlier levels soon enough, just be patient.

It's going to drop a lot more.. why not sell and then buy back when it's 5k?  Will save you a bunch of money.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:31:04
You should actually.  I'm waiting to buy again till it's low enough.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:39:16
My calculations were that it would hit 5k by the end of January.. still might come true, lets see how today unfolds.
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:00:05
It will go down to July 2017 levels again, wait till then to buy.  
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:34:08
No way it will get to $1,000... $2,000 is my prediction for the bottom.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:19:48
Short at 5.5k maybe.  Drop definitely isn't stopping.
