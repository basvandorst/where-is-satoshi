Yeah - thanks for that. I re-read the bitcoincore segwit page. I think I have a better understanding now.
Thanks again - encouraged me to go and re-read it.

Found both of your responses helpful - thanks.

Not sure man. I've thus far not had issues. One part of the ACH system that bugs me is that I can never see the money in transit. I.e I send money from one account to the other - the value disappears from that account and then shows up after a few days in the other account. I always worry that my money is gone and I'm going to have to fight to get it back. 
Fortunately the money always shows up.
ACH can be unsettling, but I haven't had any issues with coinbase. I hope things work out for you.

Why do you say it's a shitty currency by modern standards? Because it's purchasing power varies day-to-day? That variance seems to be something that will improve just with time.

Those are fair points - maybe someone would argue that the network is overly secure today, but largely I think a drop in hash rate would be bad for bitcoin no?
Regarding the price, the analysis will probably be very sensitive to this assumption - so best approach would be to probably start at flat or at the market cap being flat and iterate from there.

Hi! can you explain the process? I have an SBI account but am not sure if SBI will allow a bank wire to the US without asking questions. Also:
* Did you have to speak to an SBI bank representative before creating a bank wire? (trying to figure out if this is something you can do online, considering time zones, etc.)
* Were there any difficulties or nuances we should be aware of before setting up an Indian exchange account? (I assume you needed your OCI number, but were there pieces of information you needed that are less obvious?)
* Do you have an idea of where you must report the income? (Do you have to report income in India since that is where the sale occurred?) If yes, I believe the tax rule for this would be that the US would tax you such that the total tax rate matches your ordinary income rate.)
* How long did it take for you to receive the funds to your Wells Fargo account? (Domestic wires are 24 hours, i'm guessing international wires are 2-3 "business" days?)
Edit: changed the formatting so questions were listed out - new to Reddit posting.

I really hope they aren't using Roger Ver as their Bitcoin consultant.

Can only speak for myself, but I'm more against it because of the way that the NYA was agreed to. There was no attempt to guage user sentiment and there was no transparency into the discussions/negotations. There were no independent parties involved either, I would have liked it if Andreas or the guys from Let's Talk Bitcoin, or some journalists be included in the discussions. Someone that didn't have a profit motive and could be a more (but not completely) fair representation of the Bitcoin users.
Honestly, I support a 2MB upgrade. Ideally, i'd want a whole bunch of other HF-required upgrades to be included with that, but even if they weren't, I could get behind a 2MB HF. But I'd need the comfort of time to allow businesses, wallets, nodes, to upgrade their infrastructure to handle 2MB, etc. I don't know if 3 months is enough time. maybe 6 months is, IDK.

Logic is sound, but this is not a healthy way to grow the network, and in turn, the value long-term.
