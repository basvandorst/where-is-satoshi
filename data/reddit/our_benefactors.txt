You’re really stretching to misinterpret what he said - it wasn’t contradictory at all. Our brains are wired to detect patterns *and derive meaning from them* without any respect for the VALIDITY of those patterns. That’s what he meant by “you see faces in clouds” - your brain interprets something as looking like a face when it’s not - it’s simply a cloud

You are incorrect. You cannot guarantee the other person is willing or able to do so. Send bcash to a Bitcoin deposit on an exchange and watch what happens. You’ll either be completely SOL or have to pay a large fee for them to recover the funds.

It literally says it's a print in the first sentence.
That name also means nothing to be and the art looks ugly. The dude doesn't even have a wikipedia page, he's a nobody.
Just looked at their page (a free-tier Wix website, very professional). They only make digital art, how could you suggest that it's not a print?

You aren’t making any argument either. You’re presenting conjecture as fact. Credit cards are totally irrelevant to this topic. Whether or not they opt for bitcoin isn’t the point - it’s that having the option moves BTC closer to mainstream adoption. A lot of companies follow amazons lead when it comes to ecommerce. Microsoft isn’t a market leader by comparison.

@_date: 2017-10-20 17:59:31
There’s no way that you can guarantee you’ll get anything out of it. Plenty of tumblers have absconded with coins. There’s no way to know if it’s a honey pot or not. Lastly, nobody cares if you buy a little weed online. If you’re caught it won’t be because your payments were tracked.

Either you’re willfully ignoring my point or actually don’t understand it. I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. 
Putting it as a payment option is ADVERTISING it as an option. Take credit cards, since you’re fixated on them: Places needed to accept them before they were useful, and people would get them based on the knowledge of where they were accepted. It’s a chicken and egg problem which begins to be solved by widespread merchant adoption.
