Calling anything before the Chinese exchange closings is poor form. Humans are procrastinators, I think the end of the month will give a better idea of where the price will end up. Even if there is a run-up, the Chinese holders will just sell off to get their money out. That may even be what's happening now. All these micro bull-runs get shut down by huge selloffs. BTCCNY is already down almost 20%, and it's only the 14th.

Dimon statement, NK "hackers" tying BTC to NK, Chinese bans on ICOs and local exchanges. It's a brutal negative hype cycle.

Look at the charts and cycles. Look at dips and peaks, the dates they occurred, and the BTC news around those times. BTC is heavily news driven since there's not much of a market around it, as in buying goods and services.

I won't even chance a guess until the end of the month. China gets their Communist leadership shuffled around in October. If some new member has a bright idea, could go anywhere. US and euro interests will keep it from tanking, but if China pulls out completely (i.e. to launch their own digital currency they have been hinting at), we'll never see $5k again.

Already is as of 7:30am EST.

Bitmain is a great target for a communist anti-BTC raid after the Chinese communist leadership rotates in October. Would a headline like, "Chinese agents confiscate mining hardware from the worlds largest Bitcoin mining center" really surprise you at this point? It would send a pretty clear message.

Wait til around 6pm EST when the Chinese start waking up. Could be interesting.

Still only 6am on the west coast. There's more room for red for sure.

Congrats on being a semi-early adopter. Most people aren't. This mass exodus from BTC is driven by China, just as the rise in price was driven by China. Not sure where you think all the new value will come from to get back to $5k+ without the Chinese flocking to BTC.

You win.

Unless it rains for the rest of your life. Which may happen since China is essentially pulling out of BTC piecemeal and they were the main support of this high price.

I wish I knew. All I can do is speculate. They are at risk of losing their investments if the Chinese Communist Government makes rash decisions. What would you do if you had money at risk of evaporating?

You probably jumped the gun, though. It's going to dip more than this. Have you seen the BTCCNY charts? It's a bloodbath.

I usually have cryptowat.ch open. Lots of nice tool and interface options.
