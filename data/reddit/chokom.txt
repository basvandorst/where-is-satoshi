that's so cool! good luck and please keep us posted! and can you even say more about how this is happening? Like is this a common thing now? US? Europe? Anyways; my best!

Yea, minimum net worth of 1,000,000 to even apply for status

Can you get 10,000 pizzas for 2btc yet?
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:03:20
Electrum personal server - google it
@_date: 2018-09-06 14:12:59
You can tell it not to do that
@_date: 2018-09-06 16:21:14
I believe there is a shell command for it if u enable debug

Armory is depreciated and not support - use at your own risk
@_date: 2018-08-22 05:37:00
Yea but if you scrub through to the bottom it’s actually clear the author knows what their talking about and paints a fascinating power play move from hijab... very very important to read
@_date: 2018-05-10 19:30:22
This is the correct identification of the correct answer.
@_date: 2018-05-07 20:43:41
Did he actually say that? Pretty bold..
@_date: 2018-05-10 01:09:29
doesn't work that way. taxes don't pay for public services or infrastructure. it pays the interest on the loan from the fed. boom?

Wow, uk, satoshi?
@_date: 2018-05-04 04:05:46
Electrum rocks, it’s a lite client - if u want the full blockchain use core itself or run a node with core if u wanna help support but electrum is great for PC/Mac - coinomi for phone
@_date: 2018-05-04 03:52:49
do not use Armory \- it is depreciated and the devs no longer support it or newer protocol side upgrades. electrum is the way to go

This guys got like 4000 coins he doesn’t need more lol
@_date: 2018-05-19 07:15:44
Can u explain?
@_date: 2018-10-31 17:36:43
Not buying it, chances are it will rally in the fall, like every other time in history.. not sure why... seems to follow that timeframe of year...
@_date: 2018-10-24 05:07:22
Yes, no, maybe.
Get some exposure if it interests you. 
@_date: 2018-10-22 02:14:01
If you can’t handle the dips you don’t deserve the gains, all the best I suppose.

Yea, being the top performer basically since it’s inception almost  10 years ago isn’t standing the test of time...

Alternate accounts bro, got a bunch of em gotta keep em on recycle in regards to privacy these days
@_date: 2018-10-24 05:03:22
Yea, can confirm, no.
@_date: 2018-10-29 21:40:57
This is a great fuckin post. Crazy or not it was a great post!
@_date: 2018-10-29 21:39:20
I like this comment
@_date: 2018-10-23 15:57:37
I’m not bagholding, I sold 19k and started buying in last week again, if the investment serves you, why not exploit it?
Seems like you’re upset to be honest

Make a variant of the Bitcoin towel that has a smaller logo - it seems unbalanced even though its cents red. Make it considerably smaller and centred, or even a small corner logo would be fun.
Otherwise great idea!
@_date: 2018-06-29 03:34:17
I wonder if it means something like 21m coins.. error 800,000 lost 
It kinda looks like an error a calculator would throw if too many digits
21 error 8 digits remain to be shownkinda thing
@_date: 2018-11-08 00:46:35
Ya toyake don’t get it. It’s okay
@_date: 2018-03-03 19:17:52
I am looking for this as a collectors item! Do you know perhaps how to determine who has one and where I can buy it?
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:05:33
Actually the security of the blockchain comes from standard encryption methods, e.g. elliptic curve cryptography and SHA-256, which uses a conglomerated hash rate from computers which have sunk costs in hardware as well as electricity. 
Because using hardware to render transactions “complete” costs money, the issuance of an asset class which can be sold to pay for these variables gives it sovereignty.
Yes me and my friends can create a block chain and encrypt it, but without a million computers enforcing the network, it’s useless. Why do miners want to enforce the network? Because the network issues fungible tokens.
It’s economics man. Don’t think for a second that “it’s not bitcoin, it’s the blockchain” because that’s a fallacy, and the reason no currency has unseated bitcoin.
Sorry to break it to you, you seem like a new user here, you still have more to learn about the economic model that sustains blockchains; 
In simple terms, if the hash rate of the network grows too high and the attached token does not? It is not economically viable to continue hashing, and miners jump off. This reduces the strength of the encryption on said blockchain, making it vulnerable or slowing its settlement time, as well as other vectors.
If the hash rate is low comparatively speaking to the attached token’s value, economics dictates that miners will enforce the network, and the value of the token may perhaps increase.
You know what a blockchain is without a token attached? A ledger. That’s it. And if you know the internals from a computer science perspective the real invention here from Satoshi is the pairing of the two things, token and ledger. (More specifically when I say token, I mean the cryptographic key that allows you to modify the ledger in real time, there are no bitcoins after all, just a ledger and keys to modify their values.)
You really think that if miners didn’t have a remuneration policy for their sunk hardware costs and electricity usage they would just willy nilly mine themselves into financial ruin? Come on. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:09:55
Maybe wasting our time, but I like to come back with the actual answer, so some poor new guy doesn’t come in here and see the fud and opt out... but yea. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:40:26
It’s all good, though you have come up with a response, I would argue that you are naive in your understanding. I don’t care to debate you, and you’re new here, so it’s forgivable to misunderstand some elements of this radically different tech. However I will elucidate why the blockchain security is diminished with less users. You see, there is a moving average difficulty adjustment that uses the global hashrate as a benchmark to determine just how difficult it should be to mine blocks.
In other words, if the network has 10 miners, the block will be encrypted with the required level of encryption that it should be solveAble in approximately 10 minutes. If there were 100 miners, the difficulty would readjust so that the encryption again takes approximately 10 minutes to solve. This difficulty adjustment takes place after a set amount of blocks, and has widely been criticized as a potential attack vector. But the idea that the encryption difficulty is uniform is untrue. 
You can make a blockchain without an attached token, and rather than using cryptographic keys you can just use a centralized party to change the ledger. Congrats, you’ve invented the same system we’ve been using for about 30 years in the traditional banking system.
Anyways peace bro

Jesus... 250k. I don’t even know how I would feel if it ever hit that. Like straight up prophecy from Satoshi.
