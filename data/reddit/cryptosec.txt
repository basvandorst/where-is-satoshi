Then maybe buying bitcoin isn't the best for you. Maybe using that money to start a business might be better.

How is that a bad thing though?

OP is referring to a computer science professor though.

Yes. We're talking about safe havens here though, price is a big factor but I never said it was the only factor.

You can put the paper/s on a fire-proof safe or purchase a CryptoSteel if you're concerned about your paper potentially being burned through a fire accident.

That's a very creative way of storing your recovery seed, but that's not safe in the slightest. Make it simple. Pen and paper.

The "plunge" in stocks is nothing if you compare it to bitcoin's drops in price. For now, gold and silver is probably still your best bet for a stable asset.

Though it may be unlikely, if Coinbase gets hacked, you're screwed.

You either get a hardware wallet(Ledger/Trezor), or you keep your funds on a reputable [non-custodial]( software wallet like Electrum if you're currently not willing to purchase a hardware wallet(probably if you hold more BTC in the future).

Not 100% directly bitcoin related, but this security flaw can be taken advantage of to steal your crypto.
@_date: 2019-06-25 08:27:38
Safe or not, it isn't worth risking. Hackers aren't your only concern, too. They can simply lock up your account if they wanted too.

When the time comes, you won't even need to sell.

You should be able to see your balance on the Coinbase site/app..

The password manager encryption helps a lot. But then again, that itself won't make you secure.

Glad to help. Best of luck.

Exchange, escrow or whatever, people shouldn't be leaving large number of coins in any website at all.

No it won't. The tails operating system will be installed on your flash drive. You're just going to use this operating system temporarily, for you to create the paper wallet on a clean operating system.
And no I really don't suggest going the tablet route. Quite unnecessary and a waste of money.
By the way. Why not purchase a hardware wallet instead? Is there any reason that you're not going with the hardware wallet route?
Just some material about wallets as you might need it: 
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:21:56
If you're planning to get one, trust me; it's worth it. Quite easy to use, while being secure at the same time. From the official Ledger website of course. Please refrain from buying from 3rd parties. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 14:47:44
I heavily suggest you use tails instead. Install it on a USB drive, then boot up the operating system on your computer. Now use the tails OS to create your paper wallet.

Looks like we're going to see this meme a lot this year.
