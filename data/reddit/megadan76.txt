You and me both friend, but I doubt they take kindly to begging around here. 
There are some free bitcoin faucets online, if you read the FAQ.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:44:18
Yeah we did this already.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:43:29
How do I make sure I don't accidentally post a private key  or reveal other information online?

I guess it's time to suck it up and just buy in now before it goes mainstream. I've been putting it off, but I'm slowly becoming convinced of stability. Note that no arguement will ever convince me of this - like sobering up, the only thing that works is time.

Am I reading that right? ~$4 in electricity for ~$400 in bitcoin? 
I'm guessing there's a waiting list for these mining rigs.
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:17:04
Maybe I'll just buy one... worst case scenario, I'll lose all the money I would have spent on a PS4.

Interested to see how this will work in the real world. Will I end up replaceing my debit card with MintChip? I would love to have a secure, one tap transacation with no fees, like cash, but I don't know if that will be the case or not.

I'm a big fan of DDD (Direct Digital Democracy). I think it could solve a lot of issues present in current democratic systems (especially the American model) but unfortunately it requires a few significant changes to be in place outside of the technical issues.   
*Note that  in my Hybrid DDD model we still empower legislators to draft laws and handle day to day business, and citizens cast their vote on a  given  law the same way their representives do now.* 
1. An informed electorate. This is by far  the most difficult componant. In order to reasonably allow everyone to vote directly on a given decision they need to understand the implications of that decision from both sides. That is, understanding that voting to approve $20 billion dollars in new roads means $20b less for something else, or voting for $20b in tax reductions means no money for roads... etc. In order to enact this change we would literally need to change the entire thought process and structure of our society, from the way information is collected, disseminated, and analyzed to the way people process information and make decisions in their personal lives . Very difficult to do when information is currently commoditized and large organizations with very specific interests currently hold the majority of power over the majority  of information.   
2. If you somehow managed to over come that issue, then you still face all the normal issues faced by legislatures, compounded by the fact that you now have x million people who all want to have  a say in exactly what a given law says or does. If per item 1 all those people are informed, the problem is actually made exponentially more difficult as there is exponentially more information  being presented, digested, and debated. Grid lock is a real possibility here, so you need some system of feedback that reduces reliance on our current system of written/verbal language in order to steamline the process. Yikes!
3. If you managed to over come the previous two hurtles, you are looking good. Now of course you face the actual technical problems you pose in your post. In my mind they are easy to overcome compared to the first two. My suggestion would to start with a 'mock' vote where by the system is enabled for all voters but the results are not binding; politicians would still technically be holding the reins though as testing progresses they would be strongly encouraged to remain in line with the votes as directed by the people.
4. One final problem: what do you do when the people are wrong? No matter how informed people are, at some point there is going to come a time when a descision must be made that is to the benifit of the country but to the deficit of 51%+. This is going to be your true test of DDD. I will leave the specific scenario up to the reader to imagine, but  this test would no doubt occur at some point. And then you start the whole cycle over again, proposing that we elect a few representives to safe gaurd the positions of minorities or to protect the country from mob rule. In theory, this comes back to point one - you need an informed electorate that does not contain significant racial, sexual, etc. based biases. You would need a rational population, one that didn't believe in god or supernatural forces; a humanist society seems to be almost a requirement for DDD.   
tl;dr, society needs to undergo massive change before DDD is a viable system.

Right, but I think the value of the dollar going up and the value of gov't stocks going up are basically the same thing. I dunno, I'm not an economist. But it still seems to me that bitcoins and stocks/bonds serve fundamentally different purposes.

I love how in the video at the end of the article they show them flushing the gram of weed they bought down the toilet. I wonder what they did with the other two grams?
@_date: 2013-04-15 18:30:39
This could be tricky. 
1. Need to find  a site that you can access. 
2. Need to find a way for you to transfer money out of the country. 
The first I'm sure we can get around. The second, I'm not so sure.   
 
Or this is just  a troll, it doesn't really matter because I'm a newbie as well so I can't help, but someone can!
@_date: 2013-07-18 21:10:06
It's a little late for that. 
In theory, rational people should realize that bitcoin does not equal drugs, for the same reason that cash does not equal drugs and google does not equal piracy. Of course, some people are stupid.

This is crazy, it's going up faster than I can get home to my computer. And yet I still can't shake this horrible feeling of buying at the top of the bubble...
(I know the rational, long term arguements... it's just an emotional fear).

Good article; the CBC generally at least tries to present both sides of any story and this seems to strike a good balance between  unappologetic bitcoin believers and the unconvinced masses who dismiss it as a fad.  
I think the real truth is somewhere in between, but as others have said, if it continues to be treated only as a commedity and not a currency, it may turn out to be a fad. Personally I hope it takes off, not because it's an investment but because digital cash is a good idea in theory, despite what the FBI wants you to think.

I saw this going down but sadly missed out on the action.
I wonder if this was related to the drop in value in the last couple hours...
@_date: 2013-08-12 16:58:23
This sounds tempting, does anyone else have any experiance with that site?
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:57:10
Easy to say, but hard to predict what shape they will actually take, don't you think? A $200 to $100 bubble is a lot different than a $1000 to $834 bubble.
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:02:17


Ah, that is perfect... thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:10:57
Wouldn't that be nice!

Well, I'm not sure you're looking at the long term here. The reason people invest in gov't bonds is because they have steady, long term gains. Bitcoin is anything but steady. And it's non-inflationary, which means in theory, once we reach the full distribution of bitcoins and no new coins are being mined, the relative price  will stabilize. 
Bitcoin is great for making a lot of money in 5 years. But when you look at a 20, 30, 40, 60 year picture, it's not so clear. Bitcoin is supposed to be a currency, a way for people all over the world to pay in digital cash. It's not here to make money. Rapid gains are here at the start of the process in order to bring people on board and reward early adapters. Once the market has settled, investing in Bitcoin won't be a profit maker any more than investing in cash.

Very interesting discussion, I can't image seeing this on an American network. I don't just mean talking about Bitcoin, but all the commentators spoke slowly and at length about relevant topics, very interesting!
