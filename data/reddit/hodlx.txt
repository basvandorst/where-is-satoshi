Winners pop champagne in crisis because every crisis is an opportunity and a chance for something great.

It can always go lower. If everyone thinks it cant go lower, it probably will. Thats how markets work and shorters make BILLIONS. The question you need to ask, whats the value of bitcoin in the world? Where is the future of economy, crypto going. Based on that and if you are honest to yourself you will probably conclude 1 Bitcoin is worth over $20k in REAL value short term. Much more than McDonalds and Gold combined.

Everyone got a smartphone tho, why walk into a bank or need to log into some external bank website, when you can have your own bank in your phone?

You know nothing, sir. The biggest fortunes were made in the world from people investing into stuff that was 85% down. Not buying at $20k a coin. The winners in life go AGAINST the market. Only the SHEEP get scared.

It also shows its not really that bad, since its only 1% of bitcoins still left there now. That is a lot of money, but its really not a lot of money if you see the bigger picture, and potential positive outcomes being possible too.

Many germans remember inflation times, when you had to pay sacks of papermoney for a bread. The trust in banks is much smaller than you may think. And having secure crypto is an opportunity, not a problem.

Damn was hitbtc not paying the blackmail money again?

No one rests in this market. And still nobody can predict. Yes it can fall to $2k on monday. Or it can go to $10k on monday wiping out all short-sellers and traders.

Sorry they don't let you access your $5.

You shouldnt do alcohol and cigarettes but otherwise you are right. However you should also party NOW like its 1999 because you cant change the market anyways, so you better ENJOY IT or get out! I love it!

Crowdfunded? From banks in the blockchain? There is also a lot of crypto projects like ETHlend too. And bitcoin is much cheaper than bank transfers, except for a couple of months ago when transactions went up to like $20 now you can transfer for cents again.

There is few journalism left. Most are biased and/or opinion-pieces, especially political journalism. Even the current campaign against Facebook. Newssites figured they are better off without facebook, getting the traffic directly... And I dont even like Facebook. So thats why there is constant hit pieces against Facebook now (not just since the privacy/data issues, which arent exactly new). 
  
Anyway, in this case? I dont see that much wrong with the headline. It sums it up nicely. On the subject? I fully agree. Why would I need a bank account still? In europes its even gone so far that governments can view your bank accounts easily, I mean, its become a concern instead of a benefit for the bank customer, to have a bank account for various reasons.

nope since pp is easily reversable, bitcoin isnt

Bitcoin is just like Trump. Despite deep state, banks, media (99% endorsed crooked Hillary) the truth still won.

What safety measures? If you give your relatives the private key they own the bitcoin now. Same for if you give it to your lawyer. Its very risky.
