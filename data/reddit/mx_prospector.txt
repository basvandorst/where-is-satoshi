He will get President, you will see...(maybe with this alaskan chick as secretary).

I can help you opening up a business in Switzerland, if that helps.
@_date: 2018-05-14 10:52:36
...me ��   empty now.
@_date: 2018-05-15 11:40:38
...don't know how much a domain is worth today...
Guys, what  do you think a bitcoin domain is worth?
(Make me an offer)
@_date: 2018-05-13 08:30:15
How would you pay.
@_date: 2014-11-29 11:48:14
Realy, did you ever have been somewhere outside of the US ?
You know, it's not simple to tell a frog in a pond what "ocean" means ;-)
@_date: 2014-08-04 14:46:07
Do your own math first. CEX.io charges just 0.18 $/month per GHS maintenance.
It even doesnt matter what it is, after such a drop, every tradeable commodity goes up. So you can sell them after mining for a while for the same price you got them.
@_date: 2014-12-14 14:41:43
come on ...
@_date: 2018-05-15 10:37:15
...for instance.
@_date: 2014-11-29 07:08:20
You are out of the game if you made the restriction, that YOU have to be older then 18yr, and have been out of your own country once in your past.
Some iceblock in the Antarctic will be a good place for you to start. I can give you the bitcoin address where you can buy one. (Approximately one bitcoin per cubic meter)
@_date: 2014-08-04 14:41:36
You cant trade BTC/GHS at peta mine the same easy way. That is very important. You can jump out whenever you want to !!!
@_date: 2014-10-29 10:18:33
FIRST. A hint what the costs are for the customer. (How much more I pay here).
A short description on the mainpage who you are would not hurt. Just 2-3 lines.
The page itself looks quit professional, nice work.
@_date: 2014-11-28 10:38:31
One of the british islands is on that way, forgot which one. Keep going...
@_date: 2018-05-13 13:13:23
...so you only donate to well educated ones? ��
@_date: 2014-12-17 10:44:30
CRAP !!!
@_date: 2014-12-15 14:57:25
They did already.
@_date: 2014-01-05 16:28:17
...if I tell you exactly where we are at 31.Dec 2014. How much would you pay me for that ? Now !?
@_date: 2014-11-29 10:07:31
 is a very serious one.
@_date: 2018-05-17 03:55:27
ELECTRONEUM is the solution, because it uses next to nothing in energy!
I call that the real SECOND GENERATION coin. We will see, but I'm mostly right ��
(...can be mined with your smartphone)
@_date: 2014-07-19 07:57:03
...no worries, I wear "your" blue jeans :-)
@_date: 2014-07-19 08:43:05

@_date: 2014-07-20 23:00:10
Did you get that:
Is this coming from the same wuss ?
@_date: 2014-11-26 13:58:59
That all still does not resolve the problem, that if I do not have the old wallet.dat, all bitcoins I got later to that key are gone...
Right ..?
@_date: 2014-07-19 11:06:44
LOL, and both are useless. If you use your bombs you destroy your own planet, cutting the branch you're sitting on. And about "unlimited money", it is unlimited because it has no real value, as we all know...
That's why one bitcoin has more value than one US-dollar.
@_date: 2014-12-01 08:12:53
I would not recommend, to tell the audience here where you have your BTCs.
@_date: 2014-11-29 11:53:45
By the way, your "pinnacle of evolution" is destroying his own planet right now. Not one animal in the fucking whole world is that stupid. Think about that...
Every bloody worm is more clever!
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:32:47
What does that Gold thingy mean ?
@_date: 2014-11-23 12:54:16
Can't find it there...
I'm looking for a list.
@_date: 2014-07-20 22:46:14
Like this:
....what does it matter if the New Yorkers are not allowed to mine anymore ?!?!
@_date: 2014-12-01 15:15:49
100 bits
@_date: 2014-12-03 07:32:40
Because with a normal bank account, you have a bank as a "useless" middleman. We don't need them.
@_date: 2014-11-26 12:28:09
If you like to open a bitcoin business in Switzerland, let me know. I'm living there ;-)
@_date: 2014-01-05 16:14:38
...use half of your money now.....i would.

When EVERY porn site asks for a Bitcoin micropayment for every pic/video. No more free porn, that's the day ..!
@_date: 2014-12-14 08:31:36
lol, sorry ;-)
I bought my first bitcoins, and later I started mining them. Same as with Gold, first I bought some nuggets,later I bought a Gold mine. Both are very exciting, and both make sense, at the right time.
@_date: 2014-06-05 06:33:26
In Namibia they covered a large strip of the beach with 3m thik concrete to protect the Diamonds underneath. To prevent a market collaps.
@_date: 2014-01-05 15:32:11
For example bitcoin.de has a limit of 20 BTC per year. The new year begins for ALL users on 1 January. Many user have been waiting for weeks and months to be able to act again.
@_date: 2014-12-14 10:06:18
A bit more then I payed for equipment and power.
@_date: 2014-07-19 11:11:52
I get my McDonalds and my Coke everywhere in the world. That's what I mean. There is no reason anymore to go to the US. And as long as I stay away, I do not have to concern about their rules. But still can deal with them...
@_date: 2014-11-27 07:21:14
Is this guy not asking, how to get his paper privt key back into a wallet ?
By the way, that's my question...
@_date: 2014-05-12 17:05:09
Would be nice to make all the stolen BTC's worthless.
(By the way, I never lost a bitcoin.)
@_date: 2014-07-08 06:34:31
....even then...lol
@_date: 2014-11-29 10:02:58
You can't be serious with that rassist statement.
@_date: 2014-12-03 07:18:12
... I understand your situation very well ;-)
Let me know what's in your mind.
@_date: 2014-12-23 10:49:03
...testing. 1$ ;-) see ?
@_date: 2014-11-27 15:17:31
So the american police is doing "money laundering" !!!???
@_date: 2014-11-29 12:20:28
People with your attitude are seldom rich, same as you. They don't have enough money to do serious things, and that's for a reason.
If you where more open minded, you would realize, that Hawaii would be a bit too expensive. So try to get an agreement with a third world country, to rent one of their islands to you and pay them taxes. But, you had to rely on colored people... (too bad for you)
@_date: 2014-07-08 06:36:58
.....easy, ask for Mark Karpeles.
@_date: 2014-11-24 14:52:07
Yep, thanks.
(If I ever start using this "tip-thingy" stuff, I will remember about you.)
It's not the first time I see your name with a helpful response :-)
@_date: 2014-07-23 15:01:34
...please let me know what happens in 6 minutes.
@_date: 2015-01-19 15:21:41
...come on, he can :-(
Even if it does not pay.
Search for a coin you like, then look for a pool where you can mine them. Create account and worker. Download the recommended miner software, config and start mining. It still can be done, good luck.
@_date: 2014-12-23 10:42:04
@_date: 2014-07-23 15:14:21
That government or whatever you call it, is not relevant outside  the US. So, don't mind ;-)
They BRIC's will have the saying in this case. Period.
@_date: 2015-01-03 09:40:25
I'm in bitcoin too !!! If it does not work with that guy, let me know. Have a cookie for this perfect picture. Nice how nature works.
@_date: 2015-01-06 12:15:10
Did you get anywhere with your idea ? If not, let me know what's up. I'm in a very similar situation like you.
@_date: 2015-01-09 14:24:43
Can we have coordinates of the places, please ?
@_date: 2014-11-24 13:44:45
Exactly !
I remember the time in the 90's, when our IT crack offered me, to open any  for free in my name. (Like 
It did not make any sense, why such companys would use the internet anytime in the future. Because you could not send a drink over the internet.
Then came Netscape, and the whole thing changed dramaticly.
And if I remember the same time, where nearly all the big IT companys where laughing at these computer freaks, who saw a big time coming for the I'net.
Every effort in the direction what Valhalla is trying to do IS OUR FUTURE !!!
Don't complain about there logo and keys ...blabla.
Instead help them as much as you can, or do it better.
Stay tuned guys, keep going. Thank you very much for your effort.
@_date: 2015-01-06 10:24:57
You may have just missed the big thing by a fraction. The big value lies in the technology. And bitcoin is it's first child, maybe not that perfect. But the technology will make a huge success. Ripple will be one of the winners and is the place you should be invested. By the way, bitcoin will make his way up, sooner or later...
@_date: 2015-01-25 12:33:37
You can. What amount of money you are talking about and where are you? In what currency is the check? How much you are willing to pay for the deal?
@_date: 2015-01-08 08:44:49
The nuggets he finds, are usually more expensive then gold, because of the natural origin. Even they are just between 70-99% pure. These nuggets will give a value which does not fully rely on the actual gold price. And this price will go up too, because every year less nuggets where found.
@_date: 2015-01-08 08:40:27
If someone is a gold searcher/finder with a  gold bar, who is finding more gold every year, and puts all the gold in the new currency. How will that work out ? He can create and sell new coins, with every new finding, and can use the money to find more gold... And like real currencies, it can be baked just partially with gold...
@_date: 2015-01-06 12:04:36
We are not all idiots ;-). I got into bitcoin at $85, added some at $250. I cant really see a problem from my point of view. If you bought at $600, like friends of mine, buy some more now, to lower your buy price, and get rid of some at $450. That should work...
@_date: 2016-01-20 09:41:31
... for this we have beta releases, to test before release.
@_date: 2016-01-13 08:37:49
I see the value of bitcoin like the one of art, like a picture made by Picasso or Andy Warhol. Unique, rare, can't be copied, does not rotten and so on ...
@_date: 2016-01-13 07:57:35
I may know someone from Switzerland, who may help you..
@_date: 2016-01-10 12:29:09
...aha, that makes sense. thx
@_date: 2018-06-10 07:23:47
...have a beer, mate ��
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:26:21
I do have ETH and BTC, but for trading only.
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:33:00
When I said that ETH will go up to 35 cents or even 50 cents, I'm talking about cents, everyone made jokes about it. 
Because we where at 9 cents then.
You should have heard me laughing at the end ... sold some at 90.-$.
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:42:08
...ever heard of consequences! Responsibility ?!
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:09:22
Mainly PIVX, EOS, TRON, NEO, ONT, ADA, BAT, EMC2. Some ONT, WAX, GAS, DASH and for sure Unobtanium!
And some crappy dust, just to make sure ��
@_date: 2015-04-17 19:29:37
@_date: 2018-04-02 06:10:28
.. nope buddy. Or was that the rise from 2000$ to 20000$ because of bitcoin got used more? na
@_date: 2018-04-01 12:29:12
!!! I'm all in !!!   
Yeah, I'm first !! ;-)

@_date: 2015-03-30 04:22:03
The difference between bitcoin and others is like Rolls Royce and the other crap ;-)
@_date: 2015-03-03 11:39:26
Got back my UNO's from him just days ago !!!
Is he on reddit ?
@_date: 2015-03-07 13:51:19
Nice writing ;-) thx
@_date: 2015-03-07 14:35:17
The US Gov. will pay back the dept with bitcoins they mined in the early days, when they invented bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-23 07:13:26
..do you hope to get in contact with someone like Alex Green or Mark Karpeles?
@_date: 2015-11-03 06:21:52
600.- USD.
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:36:52
It does not matter, how much you earn. How much is left over, that's the point ��
@_date: 2015-03-06 11:31:41
As far as I know, he did not take the 10% I offered him, so I would like to use these tip thingy here...
@_date: 2017-07-11 06:19:26
The ruling is stopping whoever to do that.
@_date: 2015-03-20 10:18:20
Is the current value of bitcoin not made by the Darknet ? I think so.
Without that Silkroad stuff bitcoin would never be where it is today. I think.
@_date: 2015-03-23 11:11:30
sarcasm ;-)
@_date: 2017-07-11 06:24:28
This is not a question. You are asking others to do read thru manuals for you ;-)
...lazy dog
@_date: 2016-05-24 18:33:52
-open the page 
-click on +music
-wait about 30sec
@_date: 2017-07-11 06:21:40
...read the fucking manual first !!!
It took me 1.6 sec to find it on Google.
@_date: 2015-02-28 17:36:54
I got my MintPal UNO's back from Ferdous Ahmed !!!!!!!
@_date: 2015-02-28 17:44:20
Sorry, I'm so excited. Could not believe it. And it is a great proof for these honest guy.
@_date: 2019-05-20 09:24:10
What about ETH and the other top 50?
BTC will go up, but already at 8000.-, doubling and doubling is getting harder....
@_date: 2015-02-28 17:52:15
Noooo nooo, no pump. Unobtanium is a serious coin und does not need these things...
@_date: 2019-05-20 12:40:54
Yep, your biased investments is what I like to read.  thx
@_date: 2019-05-20 12:45:03
...but that garbage got hyped too, last time BTC went up. And even more then BTC ... adding fomo and greed should do the job for some this time.
Or not ?
