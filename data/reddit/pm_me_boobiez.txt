Posting in this thread just to see what the mentally ill PM me.  Unfortunately, they probably won't read my username.

He isn't a lawyer because if he were, he would know fraud requires scienter, which Google doesn't have in this case.  Negligence maybe, but that's a tough argument especially with a defense of comparative fault or contributory negligence.

It's how rich people get taxed.
In other words, at a much lower rate than on money you earn as income.  I want to say at 15%.  And this is only on actual realized profit.  If you just hold the asset and dont sell it, you don't owe anything.

Sorry but I don't see it.  Wishful thinking.

And I was around to hear the sky is falling at $.50 and $2 and $54 and $260.  Just because you missed the get rich boat, doesn't mean I'm wrong.

I got this email as well.  Several red flags, but overall a decent phishing attempt.  One dead giveaway in all of these phishing emails is "Kind regards,".  No American signs an email/letter with "Kind regards".

I keep a paper wallet in a bank deposit box along with a digital copy on a flash drive in the same vault.  (Both were made with Armory.)  Then I have a "watch only" wallet that I use when I need to receive coins.  I'm a hoarder, and don't spend them very often though.
