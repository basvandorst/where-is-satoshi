So long as they are friendly and informative (you did both), I see no issue with such posts.  They are intrinsically helpful to the community as well.

Suit yourself.  My current mycelium suit (lol, what an image here) may look bad (not really imo), but I prize reliability and backup features over a pretty interface any day.

I love both Jans.  Is this okay?  Thank you both!  I still think the one you work on has a better name (and almost, as a result, seems more trustworthy - strange but true, maybe I'm just crazy).

Just buy your SDRs early, like right now!  Oh wait, mere mortals such as our petty selves cannot even find them, my bad.

Sorry for the downvotes.  You should probably also be over at with us, but honestly, it gets depressing fast and most can't handle it.

I understand.  I get some sort of sick pleasure out of not spending money and making ends meet on peanuts because it's a muscle that may need flexing in the future. Suit yourself!  It does matter to the extent which you allow yourself to care, but this is a decision too...

Another old hat coming out of the woodwork.  Glorious post, and I couldn't agree more.
Don't worry, our economy will get the proper correction eventually.  I'm not sure we'll be celebrating it at all, though, as revolution/collapse sucks horribly and is not pretty at all.

There is a noteworthy financial difference between a *liability* like a car compared to *assets*, such as housing, stocks, coins, gold, etc.  "Nothing wrong" implies that you see no issue, but there is indeed opportunity cost for that money tied up in a more expensive car, which is what seems implied here by the others.
Buying the cheapest car you can afford, so long as you're handy and can repair the car for reasonably cheap as well, is not bad advice whatsoever imho.  It would traditionally be one method of pocketing money where the common wisdom doesn't go because the common wisepeople usually aren't mechanics/engineer-minded folk.
I will say there is "turning point" when money-based decisions start to level off/change gears (joke not intended) and this might be what you're referring to.  For example, my reasonably frugal and wealthy grandfather saving his white cotton socks from the 70's that had holes in them "just in case" is clear evidence that he was affected by the depression in a fairly negative way.  He had no business worrying about stupid garbage socks, honestly, and it would've saved him money/time/stress to just get rid of them and live in a cleaner house.
It's just tough to gauge this because we're speaking in generalities.  I think it's different for everyone.
I drive a 2003 Honda Civic Si that's basically an old, fast piece of shit.  It's just starting to get rusty so I'm going to sell it soon, but it's kind of like wifing a whore because this thing was abused and raced when I got it.  I repaired everything and now I'm selling it.  Top be clear, this is an example of what *not* to do on this side of the car spectrum, but this is like the fifth time I've done this and it's what I get for dipping into sports cars.

Absolutely understood.  It does 0-60 in about 7.5 seconds or so (every time, at least this, conservative estimate), it was a teeny bit faster until I finally replaced the cat from the stupid hole that the last owner put in it.  It's a sporty economy car.  Insurance kicks up for this, but not for a 1992 Acura Integra which was about 8 or 9 seconds for 0-60... idk man I don't even care what this shit is called honestly, but if insurance is up for it then there must be a reason.
I have also gotten compliments on it from many young lads so I think I don't mind that you don't think it's sporty, I have other people telling me otherwise.  Besides, I'm selling it, I am not my car or any of my possessions so it doesn't really matter what we call it and my ego won't suffer, lol. I'm about to spend a year touring USA on a crappy bike, so... Rofl. 
What I meant was dipping into cars that get raced. This one was, the kid got three speeding tickets going over 100mph, so the dad had to sell it and teach the kid a lesson.  It would be wise not to buy old cars that get raced, and that was all my advice was to folks who wanted to do this.

This is a well written passage, especially towards the end.  I do agree with all, but even if I hadn't, thanks for contributing such meaningful prose.

As I understand it, people who prefer putting this data in sidechains.  I feel like that's dangerous for future bitcoin adoption, but trying to understand this whole debate seems a bit like doing dating philosophy with an alien pickle.

This comes off sounding a bit lazy.  I believe Uncle Sanonymous wants YOU to do these things, and to externalize them and remove yourself from the party of responsible individuals is indeed part of the problem (I share in parts of the problem myself, no doubt, with my own technology and senseless gadgetry addictions, my insistence at furthering my own convenience and comfort over learning to live without something that is ultimately contributing to the excessive, "blowing at the seams" sorts of international concerns you brought up).  
Just existing as we do, we are part of the problem, and that's all I'm trying to say to provide context.  You may as well not worry about the things that you can't have any success changing.  Once we accept this, we stop pointing, asking, and pretending, and instead remember how to keep looking at how to change ourselves (which, I find, makes me happier in the long run anyways, but this is just my take on it).
On the other hand, I agree with you...?  Corruption is seemingly a massive problem that works to further compound the global issues.

Yep. Sadly I'm kind of an IT dork and that's it.
