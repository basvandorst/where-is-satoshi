In my case it's the only hardware wallet that supports the crypto currencies I own, trezor, keep key or other lesser known ones don't.

I tried explaining the reasons why I tend to defend this device here, not sure whether it makes things clearer or worse, but I tried!

If it's not too late consider taking apart the nano which is only held by plastic clips, putting all parts in distilled water, rinse them with it, and **then** let it dry on a piece of kitchen paper.
The washer mix of soaps and detergents will leave traces over the circuit which regardless of it being dry to the touch might short circuit the device. Distilled water is not conductive which makes it the only liquid you can use for this purpose that I know of. Putting it on dry rice might reduce the moisture to some extent but if there if the liquid made its way inside and touched the board, you are better of doing what I suggest.
As you can see in the attached image which is one of my ledgers disassembled just for this, water can and will enter the ledger both through the micro usb connector and around the display, none of them are water proof.
It could easily be made water resistant (I don't dare to say proof) with some hot glue and a steady pulse, covering the inside of the connector and sealing the display in place.
There's a super handy article on ifixit that talks about [water damage in electronics]( I quote:
