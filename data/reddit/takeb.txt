If someone finds your paper wallet they can sweep it of all your bitcoin in an instant. If you use a ledger and someone finds your 24words they will be useless if you have applied a 25th word. Also if they find your ledger device it will erase itself if they try and guess your pin code. 
It sounds like a lot to grasp but this is the price you pay for being your own bank. 
You need to learn how to make use of the most secure practices. This is not something to be taken lightly young buck. 
Plenty of tutorials on YouTube for ledger and the 25th word.

Nice work or reusing a meme template a wording it slightly different than the original artist did.
Are you seriously that desperate for karma?

Nah man. Trust me. Just get a hardware wallet. Learn to use the 25th word function. Simulate a scenario where you forget your ledger password and restore the device from your 25 words. Just get comfortable using the device and restoring it so you understand the process then move your bitcoin to it. I’ve seen way too many horror stories in my time in this space to suggest anything but the use of a ledger nano. 
There are other precautions you can take too. I’ve written another post about it. I’ll see if I can find it.

No. Never. Ever. 
Get a ledger nano man. Learn how to use hardware wallets use a 25th word that is only stored in your head so if someone steals your keys (24 words) they’re useless to them. Stay away from mobile wallets. Do not enter your private keys into any electronic device.

Have you considered one of these? [
Save yourself a whole lot of hassle.

Maybe in the future but for now just get use to using one hardware option and then as you build your stack you can keep very small amounts on mobile wallets. 
Here’s my reply to another person on a different thread:
Its very dangerous to store your recovery phrase on a device thats connected to the internet especially if other people like to mess with your stuff. You should think about using cryptosteel ( to physically back up your recovery phrase and also adding a 25th word to your phrase that is only stored in your head. That way if someone steals your 24 words they cant access your crypto.
Another method is to source a cheap laptop and reinstall the OS and never connect it to the internet (air-gapped) and use a secure USB device with a physical pin keypad ( or a thumbprint (biometric) access and use that to store  your recovery phrase.

No scripted answers available. These people aren’t able to develop original thoughts they’re unconscious.

Also never had a Ponzi scam sell $3 billion worth of bitcoin, 100 bitcoin at a time for over 2days. So there’s that too.

It’s as easy as downloading bitcoin core wallet, assigning a static local ip to your computer and forwarding port 8333 in your router. After you’re synced up you’re good to go.
