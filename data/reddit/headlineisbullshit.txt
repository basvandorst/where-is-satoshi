Wouldn’t you only owe tax if you converted it to dollars? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:19:56
Just everything to do with the fact that they no longer held positions of power. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:42:31
What are you high? Our economy and stock market are growing at an unprecedented rate. The current leadership is perfect for economic growth and worldwide leverage. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:54:36
Yes I believe you do. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:28:01
I will. I have held through these crashes for years. It is quite exhilarating actually. Go back to your socialist reddit hole. HUR DURR THIS IS CERTAINLY THE END OF DRUMPFFFF!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:57:42
If you want any real advice you have to name the country. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:44:16
That’s exactly what bitcoin is. It has literally nothing to do with your liberal wealth redistribution bullshit. Bitcoin is freedom. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:28:56


That is not a fact. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:02:30
Well they all seem to be going down for sexual assault. So that's nice. Not to mention the fact that they shut down the Clinton Foundation and the Podesta group. Why would they shut down the Clinton foundation if it was a top rated charity that did good all over the world? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:55:05
You can also store money in your brain. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:29:44
Yes because Hillary Clinton and her criminal cabal are the people having he whistle blown on them. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:44:07
Sorry. The Clinton Global Initiative is shut down. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:01:08
Amazing that people on of all places would be on board with that rotten bitch. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:01:18
I think you should probably do some more reading on the subject to be honest. Is the 2k expendable because if you use it to buy bitcoin there is a very good chance that you won't see any gains for a while. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:42:09


Yea, you're right. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:32:08


Are you sure about that? Putin seems to be a good friend of Bill Clinton. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:05:07
Remember when they claimed it was 17 for like 2 years and then the NYT had to amend their official statement to only 3. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:04:23
Lol. Seriously it has been almost 3 years and you still have ZERO dirt on Trump. Do you really think there is something yet to come out? Also, if you leak something to wikileaks and they don't release it, guess what, you release it somewhere else. We need wikileaks to leak information on the democrats and the Washington Post and New York Times to leak information on the Republicans. Painfully obvious. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:45:46
 RICH
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:56:46
I bought my first bitcoin in April 2013 for $157. I was so proud and happy. Promptly crashed that same night. My best advice for you is to be patient and never panic. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:32:32


@_date: 2017-12-15 16:30:40
He said anything in the 2 pages of RNC hacks were already publicly available information. Also, Trump doesn't use email so good luck with that. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 04:43:00
Welcome back!

Is this the new doge!?
@_date: 2017-02-07 03:13:56
Pretty sure Trump's budget chief is the Bitcoin congressman. The first congressman to accept and advocate Bitcoin I believe. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 03:30:38
Don't worry about these people. I'm not tired of winning yet! They'll see the light soon. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 05:34:30
I bought my first Bitcoin in the first 2013 bubble for $150. It promptly crashed and everyone laughed at me and the media said the dream was over. News flash: Bitcoin will always exist so long as people want private money. The price is irrelevant. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 03:25:32
You're an asshole. Who cares if he didn't use the appropriate than. You are deflecting any real discussion because you are being a brat about Trump. 
Do you think Elon Musk is stupid because he happens to like trump quite a bit. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 03:09:03
You mean the anti free speech riot?
@_date: 2017-02-07 03:21:27
Most are probably just as indifferent as anyone else. If anything, they support it because it's disruptive to the status quo and global elites. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 04:26:08
Sure 
@_date: 2017-02-20 06:10:18
Ahh. Yea that's retarded. Basically a knock off paypal
@_date: 2017-02-20 05:37:30
God damnit. We used to have the Bitcoin tip bot here. You coulda sent him $4 instead of Reddit. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 19:05:14
@_date: 2017-01-11 21:31:59
first Bitcoin I bought was for $150 dollars in 2013. It promptly crashed down to $100 or something like that the next day haha. Doesn't matter it's worth 800 today.

@_date: 2017-01-05 00:33:34
Nooo. Just wait. Too many people got burned last time around. Get $20 worth and watch for a bit to take the ride if you want but do not put anything substantial. Whales will take advantage of this rally and pump and dump. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 05:07:09
And a bunch of people who have continuously called it dead for the last 5 years.

@_date: 2016-12-21 19:32:21
No sorry. I thought you from another thread. I was on mobile when I replied to that. I stick by my story. As long as we allow companies to use China for cheap labor, our environment will continue to deteriorate. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 22:25:10
Check out this map. I wish it would show vote totals though.
@_date: 2016-12-20 22:22:19
Yea but what exactly are the counties that flipped and what are the vote totals in those counties. That is on me to investigate though. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 02:19:18
I mean there really isn't much more the government can do. They make all bitcoin sellers follow KYC and AML laws just like banks. Bitcoin is still the decentralized, global network it's always been. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:42:52
Trump won the popular vote in 30 out of the 50 states. Trump and every single other president played by the rules as they were agreed upon before the election started. Get 270 electoral votes. This means campaigning everwhere. If it were a popular vote contest, Trump would have campaigned solely in California, New York and Illinios. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 23:09:30
798.98 on coinbase!
@_date: 2016-12-20 22:11:03
Those vote totals are inaccurate though. They are outdated. More have since been added.
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:45:10
If california didn't exist, Trump would have won the popular vote by 1.5 million or so. So does the popular vote of the individual state not matter to you? Because Trump won 30 of those. We are the United **STATES** of America. Not The United America. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 01:33:08
And it does seem that China, India and Brazil are not cooperating with the Montreal protocol. We allow China to send us cheap goods with no or barely any tariffs or VATS. This encourages them to produce more and more and care less and less about the environment. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 22:05:13
Either way, the electoral college was set up so all states are equally represented. What you are asking for goes against one of the center pieces of our constitution and our values. Like I said, we are the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Emphasis on states, states rights and equal representation.
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:55:54
I understand that it is useless because California does in fact exist. But, US presidental elections are the road to 270, not the road to the California popular vote. Need I not even mention that California does not require a SS number or even a drivers license number to register to vote. Literally anyone can register and vote in California. You just need to write down an address. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:38:58
You're an idiot. Trump will not stop China and India from destorying the environment just Obama didn't stop them. There is little we can do about it. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 15:26:18
I'm just curious what made you think or say that? 
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:52:23
That is whole heartedly not true. Look at wikipedia. I wonder why exactly you would say something like that.
Trump: 62,979,636
Romney: 60,933,504
McCain: 59,948,323
George Bush 2004: 62,040,610

@_date: 2016-12-21 01:25:48
Yes we can come together to fix climate change but we won't. Hillary Clinton would absolutely not do a god damn thing for the environment aside from pass bogus regulations that only benefit her donors. Sorry for insulting you. I am watching your video now. Thanks
@_date: 2016-12-21 00:58:43
Wyoming gets 3 votes only because of the 2 senators. They get 1 based on population. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 15:42:54
Just seems like something that would be thrown around a lot on @_date: 2016-12-21 00:40:25
They get a different number of votes based on the amount of representatives they have which is based on population. That is equal. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 02:57:26
We are talking about the environment. China is not following the Montreal Protocol that you posted because they are the worlds profucer due to shit trade deals that only benefit the upper 1% who could give two fucks about climate change. You think Jeff Bezos and the Walmart give a damn about the environment? They stand to lose the most through trumps trade policies and they are the ones responsible for much of China's pollution. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 02:20:50
Yea, Trump was to put fair tariffs on Chinese goods that equal the playing field. The reason people make their crap in China is because they have no choice. 


WE VOTED FOR TRUMP FOR LITERALLY THIS EXACT REASON!!!
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:40:57
No. The white rust belt voters that voted Obama last time, voted Trump. Trump flipped 200 counties from blue to red. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:37:33
What other laws could they possibly make that aren't in place already? 
@_date: 2016-12-21 15:26:04
There is something called the Montreal Protocol. Basically a worldwide agreement to reduce greenhouse gases. Increasingly, China, India and Brazil are refusing to follow the accord of the protocol. As long as we continue to allow China to send us their cheap goods with no vat or tariff, they will continue to ignore the standard. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:15:10
I mean, they’re trying to expose Trump but they have nothing on him. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:30:53
2 years ago Julian Assange was reddits favorite hero.  Then he exposed the corrupt democrats and they turned on him. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:04:47
How’s that?
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:12:47
Yea. Hot fucking chance of that ever happening. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:03:43
Bitcoins could be worth 5¢ and people would still be using it without government interference. That’s the whole point of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:49:09
He endorsed Trump! 
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:15:22
I love guns and I think religion is what holds much of society in place. I believe in freedom and privacy. Bitcoin is freedom and privacy. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:13:20
It is not under the radar though!  
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:35:04
They loved him when he was exposing republicans but not when he exposes democrats
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:57:16
He literally showed collusion between the DNC and Hillary Clinton to knock Bernie Sanders out of the race...
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:56:41
Dude the guy has been having meetings everyday for decades. You are nitpicking and sound absolutely desperate. Trump won because he had a remarkable campaign. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:17:10
Yea because for every Russiagate believer there is a pizzagate believer. /s 
Pizzagate is fringe and the average conservative don’t even know what it is. Meanwhile, every single person on the left believes in the nothingburger Russia conspiracy. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:08:26
Stay under the radar? Wtf are you talking about. Bitcoin and blockchain tech is in the finanacial News every single day this year. The lid has been blown off. Assange pointing out the freedom that bitcoin gave to Wikileaks is widely known already. Have you ever even been on their website? 
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:11:49
Lol. I bet two years ago, you’d be sucking Assanges cock if he asked you too. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:40:06
Oh wait. I thought you meant Donald Trump not Jr. He is a dumbass for taking that meeting, I agree but it had absolutely zero affect on the campaign. Trump won because he campaigned harder than his opponent and spoke to the American people. Plain and simple. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:12:37
Have you read the emails? The DNC was actively pushing Bernie out. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:46:33
I always think about how rich those morons at could be right now.
