Standard Bank is one of the most innovative financial institutions in the WORLD and are miles ahead of 80% of American and European counterparts from a technology perspective. Switchless provide FIAT platforms for multiple banks globally. I think here we have a situation where too many assumptions are made without a clear understanding of the software product development life cycle, business development process and project management methodologies.
Whilst I think the initial news could have benefited from more accurate reporting and a deeper understanding of the actual project goals and objectives, we should not lose sight of the fact that Standard Bank are wide awake in respect to the crypto-currency space. 
I would put my bet on Standard bank being one of the first Banks in the world to recognize and explore the benefits that the bitcoin protocol brings, placing them on pole position as the crypto-currency matures and the way we bank, and think about money evolves.

we invested in the software company that developed the platform. BTCMarkets.net is a customer. We do not share any liquidity with any other brand and do not plan to, but we may include AU$ when we introduce international customers to iceCUBE. Gareth G

We are registered in South Africa at CIPC (the old CIPRO) as "internet currency evolution cubed pty ltd". We also have an about us page ( and have disclosed our lawyers and accountants with whom I have personal relationships. Our office in South Africa is not rented, I own it out right (and have done for 10years), so packing and running is not an option. My personal contact info is freely available and I already have a solid reputation within the International Bitcoin Community. I am happy to alleviate any fears any one might have. Regards Gareth Grobler

my personal view is, why wouldn't you use both ? from the little I know they have provided a good service and are honest so if you only dipping a toe or not trading much, you should keep your custom with them. If there are however arbitrage opportunities or you would like to explore Litecoin trading, you are welcome to try ICE3X. Regards Gareth G

imo the whole point is that no-one can "corner the market?" I think it is fairly straight forward. Good service + honesty = respect &amp; reputation = market leader. voila

1. Bitx the is only one other exchange as far as I know, and we both charge 1%? We do have the facility to provide trader accounts, you are welcome to contact us via our site to discuss further
2. We use electronic id verification which we have to pay for, so unfortunately we need to recoup the expense.  
3. Yes we do have an api which we will be making available over the next few days
