At least he spelled crypto with a C instead of trying to be super kool.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:06:14
I will third that.
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:18:14
It got pumped'n'dumped like a dirty Tinder sloot. They'll never see 3K again.
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:20:17
Nobody knows. Yes, I'm in. Friends and family have followed suit, but I've allowed them to make their own decision. This is what I've done and this is what I'm doing sort of thing. If it tanks, well, it was their choice. I don't want to be on the hook for what could end up being bad advice. The first thing I tell them is that just because I've done this, it doesn't mean that they should too.
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:06:19
Do you get muny for doing this? You have to pay for your internet and electricity, plus time put in for configuration and maintenance, etc.
@_date: 2018-01-25 06:32:12
Sounds like you should not be investing. It's gambling. Only invest what you can afford to lose. It's like rule number one.
@_date: 2018-01-27 09:44:52
I'm genuinely surprised and in a good way. Apparently I hang out on too much.
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:13:41
You just reminded me of climate change.
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:01:10
Ruthless! LOL
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:19:27


That's why.
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:23:56
Hmmm... Doesn't say "HODL" on it. I like it.
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:53:06
CME, not Cboe.
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:53:39
Real men trade.
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:11:03
Think about how shitty you will feel if it does crash and she is out that money.
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:32:59
If you put it in your optical drive you will get Bitcoin. Trust me, I'm IT.
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:36:21
See, this is why I usually just shitpost.
@_date: 2018-01-24 09:32:32
Take their money and run.
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:56:24
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:18:37
That's great. People pay for their electricity and can use it as they see fit.
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:59:33
[Get out while you still can!](
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:33:28
GOVERNMENT CRACKDOWN INCOMING! SELL NOW!
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:37:34
Hmmm... Nope. We're going to see 8K very soon, possibly lower. A double head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, plus a wedge told me so.
@_date: 2018-01-24 06:47:08
Guess we know who wears the pants. Hint: It's not you.
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:10:31
You should be a weather man.
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:52:40
I was surprised they took the award over CNN. Not that I thought they were anything but.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:50:21
It'll be even cheaper in two weeks. Don't worry.
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:46:43
Everybody masturbates, don't even worry about it.
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:03:59
Still a shithole.
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:13:23
YOU'RE SHITCOIN CASH!
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:46:47
It's okay, I'm already back at it.
@_date: 2018-01-25 05:07:29
Don't tell me what I can and can't use.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:15:15
Anything for some clicks.
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:49:57
By that logic you should all love Trump, because he hates him.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:07:02
The lack of responsible journalism in all fields is so rampant. It's no longer about the journalism. It's about making money. Maybe it always was that way.
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:53:51
I read as antimatter and raised an eyebrow.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:37:13
Banking on that. Let's see!
@_date: 2018-01-25 06:51:56
You'll need balls of steel and an above average brain.
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:01:11
Annnd he went there. LOL
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:37:11
This guy will have put in countless hours of effort to make this happen.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:08:22
Epic heist. I say he earned them, albeit illegally.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:52:46
LOL @ OP so triggered. Got weak hands, bruh?
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:28:43
Fuck right off is what I'd say to that.
@_date: 2018-01-25 06:48:34
You can't just go assuming genders like that.
@_date: 2018-02-10 05:51:37
I feel like I've seen this exact story posted on here before.
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:48:44
About as much as anything in astrology.
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:21:30
What what?
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:23:41
I rike it. I rike it a rot.
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:20:19
Laptops don't have that capability out of the box. You are troll?
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:28:21
The further I zoom out, the more it looks like the dotcom bubble.
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:12:51
Own it and don't be a bitch.
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:43:02
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:50:00
Twitter twit with imaginary graph magic. Nothing to see here.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:09:51
Even if you buy back in for even cheaper?
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:50:05
I think Bitcoin is a pretty cool guy. Eh kills fiat and doesnt afraid of anything
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:56:37
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:49:59
It's just a fad, like gluten free.
@_date: 2018-02-11 01:21:11
Celebrities promote a lot of ridiculous things, [like blowing up the White House](
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:51:12
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:11:00
If you're dense enough to fall for something like that, you deserve it.
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:56:46
