Give whales even more opportunity to manipulate the market when they want.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:17:23
I've had BTC since $30 and still don't pretend to know what's going on. Though I admit I don't try to follow as much as other guys. I had people asking me about BTC since $1000 and never once told them one way or the other. I didn't/don't want to be responsible for people losing money if it happens to crash, and no one knows if and/or when it will.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:47:32
There's a big group of people behind BCC and they try to manipulate the market. They did it before with a huge pump and dump and it's happening again. But I think the end goal is to flip BTC with BCC. Now Coinbase owner added BCC to Coinbase and publicly said he sold his BTC, so he's obviously a part of that group.  
That's my thinking anyways. Someone else can probably give more details.

Cryptocurrencies worth more than my local bank with one branch!!!! It's happening!!!
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:53:44
I sold around $10k thinking it was gonna correct and had to buy back in later. Definitely kicking myself for that. Who knows what's going to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:37:06
No one knows. Half the people here are new to crypto and pretend to know the answer and the other half hold crypto for a while and say what they want to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:41:18


Thanks for your unbiased and experienced opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:42:08

What a dumb fucking question. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:38:09
So you knew what bitcoin was five years ago but haven't heard anything about it until this week?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:45:07
That doesn't even make sense since you had a bot that tipped people it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:32:08
How long do transactions take right now from Binance?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:08:14
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:40:20
Yeah that's pretty funny actually.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:13:46
Was definitely planned.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:09:46
Yeah, I don't even care anymore. Funny how that works.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:15:25
I haven't followed the whole mtgox thing. Can someone tell me why can't people get their btc from mtgox? Are they just going to steal them?
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:40:46
First ones I bought were at $10!
I don't really have the cash, I have some in investments, and I'm debating taking out enough to buy ten more bitcoin. I can't imagine it not going back up to the $900-$1000 in the very near future. That being said nothing is guaranteed, and a lot of times things don't work out like we want them to!
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:31:25
Thanks a lot.
I'm tempted to buy some right now at this price. can't imagine it going down below $500.
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:14:18
Oh shit,d iddn't even see the link, thought this was self post lol. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:51:35

@_date: 2017-08-15 04:01:44
Thanks for the downvote, exactly what a 14 year old would do lol. You showed me! lol. Not poor or angry. Just tired of fucking morons spewing bullshit they know nothing about.
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:08:04
So if I'm on my pc, I transfer my btc to a new wallet.
Then on my laptop should I install electron cash, import my now-empy wallet seed. Will that work?
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:49:30
No, you're a fucking loser. Losers say loser things are cool.

I don't follow litecoin but see people often mention this. But I'm curious, Litecoin is pretty old in its own. With all these new coins out you'd assume one of them is even better than Litecoin?
I remember when Litecoin first came out. I was in Bitcoin forum, people were selling them like 10,000 of them for something ridiculous like $100. I went off on how stupid they were because there would never be multiple successful cryptos. Boy I wish I would have dumped a few hundred into it at the time. Mind you Bitcoin was $30, so wish I bought more of that too!
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:14:52
Yeah, someone else is refreshing waiting for me to reply so they can downvote. You're just proving what a fucking idiot you are over and over again.
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:03:08
Where's the updated guide?
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:49:49
You don't, but just say you don't know anything, why pretend you do then ask if it's good to buy when it's low lol.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:06:23
bro. You can't call anyone cool or not cool. lmao
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:32:12
Yeah I bet you are. You sound like a 14 year old fucking loser.
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:35:27
14 year old.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:07:07
Just wondering, you still downvoting my posts to show me?
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:00:55
Thanks. Is there somewhere I can read about Bitcoin Cash? I just stepped away the past couple days to let whatever happen happen. Now I can't seem to find any info on the split. I have my BTC, should I worry about bitcoin cash at all?
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:52:57
Some of you morons make me cringe. You have no fucking idea where it will be in a month, nevermind four years.
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:55:53
Okay bro. Don't forget to downvote. Really shows me!

@_date: 2017-09-01 18:26:50
I think it has to pop eventually but at the same time, I'm just not sure when it's going to go. It seemed like last week it was going to happen, but I think there are too many people buying when it drops down even a bit, that it stopped it from dropping more.
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:55:15
Bull Market, any time CNBC says anything we laugh at them. Bear market, CNBC says something about bull market, all the sudden we take it seriously.

Do you sell machines?

Checked out about 6 of them and seems they all want to have their own machines but not sell them.
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:59:54
I remember when LTC first came out. I publically said how stupid it was and only one currency will survive, if that. They were selling for under 5 cents each. Man I'm kicking myself for not even investing $100 in it.

Onc eon electrum do I need to do anything? What should I be backing up other than passphrase?

Is passphrase same as seed? :(
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:33:49
Was told elctrum was okay because you hold the keys. No one seems to want to help but just say it's been asked a ton of times already.
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:44:32
lol missed that! Thanks. Other than the phrase, do I need to save or download anything else?
@_date: 2017-05-16 17:26:02
I looked at a bunch on that site and no where on any of the sites do they offer them for sale. Seems like they just want to get their own products out there.
I'll check out generalbytes. Just curious why you're biased?

I moved them to Electrum fyi. But now I'm trying to find out if I need to do anything more to make sure they're safe there!

Still over my head. As someone with bitcoin should I be concerned? Thanks for the reply 
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:16:33
Thanks. Helps a bit, still confusing though as I don't really follow mining or how it works. I have a few bitcoins, should I be worried? If it splits should I be selling as fast as I can?
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:36:13
Oh wow, thanks. So their short term greed could fuck everything up for the long term.

@_date: 2013-11-20 05:14:07
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:00:08
Yeah I'd definitely sell a nice chunk of them, just in case.
I sold 15 at $200-$300 over the past two weeks and I'm kicking myself lol.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:12:24
Alright I'm going to keep these for a while. Honestly I probably would have sold these long ago but I totally got away from bitcoins. I probably would have been overjoyed at $50 and sold them lol.
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:01:46
That's what's scary about the whole thing.
What if someone who has thousands of coins does this at $900. Cashes out, rebuys at $600. It's scray one person with a lot of coins can impact the market like this.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:32:12
Fuck off. upvote if you agree
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:59:59

Thanks. That seems like it makes sense.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:57:40
Pretty new. Holding onto my bitcoins that I bought for $13 each.
Just seemed like it was gaining momentum like crazy, good news on the hearings, didn't think this would be the time for it to pop.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:09:39
I'm kicking myself for selling 15BTC over the last two weeks for $200-$300 each.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:06:33
I could always use some extra cash. I'm wanting to enroll in a course right now and a couple coins would cover it, which would be nice. But at the same time, I'm now regretting selling the ones I just did, and thinking I should have held on to all 25BTC and just forget about it for a while, like I did this time.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:22:39
Cash out, crash the market, rebuy at lowest price.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:08:18
Damn I can't believe it went up to $900 today. Unbelievable.
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:35:03
I actually lucked out, I just totally walked away from it for a year. Then I couldn't find my password. Saw they were at $200 and sold a bunch. Wish I didn't find my password for a couple more weeks lol. If I actually watched it I'm sure i would have cashed out long ago lol
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:22:43
I had 25, and I sold about 15 over the last two weeks for $200-$300 each. Obviously regret it now, but I just don't trust that it's this easy to cash in on it. I still have 10 left. It's hard not to sell themf or $500 each when I paid $12 each for them.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:49:22
Wht happened? Was there news of anything or just declining?
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:45:08
Holy fuck. How many did he cash out?
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:14:42
So... the guy is a genius.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:03:06
You hang out with the wrong people.
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:32:20
I don't know.
When they were worth $12, I knew it was going to go up and up, didn't think this high, but with there being 21M, it just made sense it would go up. My concern was and still is, that the government wants their cut. They want their hands in there. My initial thought was that it could get shut down. It's too big for that now, but it just seems like a too easy of an investment for it to keep skyrocketing up.
I had 55 bitcoins last year, wish I still had those too :(
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:36:28
I regret selling them, but I honestly wasnt' following when I sold them. I just saw they were worth $200, and started selling them. Didn't do any research on it to see if people felt they were going to keep going up.
To me it just seems to easy to buy now and sell at $1000+. Just scares me.
@_date: 2013-10-22 05:18:54
Kicking myself, I was really about to get into it and start hoarding them, but I got lazy.
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:07:52
After reading that exact thing in another post, I found that interesting.
What happens if people just buy to invest and hold on to, and no one uses them to actually buy stuff? If the value keeps gonig up and up, why would someone want to use it to buy things?
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:41:46
Trying to buy 10+ :/
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:09:45
I'm kinda thinking that too. I can't see it going up much higher without falling back. That being said I'm sure people have been saying that since $300. I have some RRSPs invested that I'm thinking about cashing in and buying BTC if it drops down to $200-$3000 range. Maybe 25% of my RRSPs.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:18:21


Was replying to this. Saying I could use the money. My coins, not yours lol
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:41:53
15%, that's brutal.
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:53:15
Yeah I just read about the hearings. I should have looked into it more before I started selling it off.
The way I see it is if I sold 25BTC for $5000, for what originally cost me $250, it's not the end of the world. Sure it could have end up being sold for $50,000, but hey a 50x return is not bad.
I have about 10 left and I'm thinking I should hang on to them. Though I wouldn't mind the extra $5,000 right now either.
You're right, my experience is with stocks not money, but it still scares me. It just seems way too easy.
@_date: 2013-10-22 04:37:21
I bought about 20 at $12.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:58:26
I'm debating buying 10 coins.
Which is stupid since I sold 15 coins for $200-$300 last week.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:48:26
Fuck me. Lucky guy. Good for him. If I had money to throw around back then I would have bought more. I guess this will be a common theme as there are quite a few people with large numbers.
