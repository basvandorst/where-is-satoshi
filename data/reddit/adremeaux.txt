Clearly your friend isn't actually Russian because a Russian never would have sent something like this. The Russian system is far worse and far more corrupt than the American system.

People are delusional if they think many of the current replacements for Gox aren't going to turn out to be just as bad.

If you are so low on money that a single overcharge of $150 is going to put you into the negative, *why the hell are you buying bitcoins?*

Reddit split from Conde Nast last year. You can restructure your sentence as "Reddit is a subsidiary of the parent company of the company that owns Wired."
To put it another way, they almost zero relation anymore. They are operated under the same massive international media conglomerate, nothing more.

Gold and silver and no longer currencies, cigarettes in prisons are an extremely specialized case with no bearing on the free market, and bank notes are not private.

What is there to learn? It's a standard speculative bubble that's been repeated god knows how many times throughout history. The only difference here is the technological basis, opening the bubble up to a much larger audience than ever before—and also an audience that for the most part has little to no experience investing.

Sports betting is easily one of the worst long term gambling strategies to take. Have you ever actually tried to bet money lines or spreads over a long period of time? It's fucking impossible, even for the absolute most knowledgeable people in the world. Virtually no one can stay more than a few points above 50/50 when betting Vegas odds, as they have their odds down to a science. And with typical sports betting payouts, you need to be at 55-60% just to break even. Good fucking luck. By the odds, you'd legitimately be better off just putting it all on black.

Well, no, the difference in the stock market is that, when you play long and you play safe, pretty much everyone wins. If you are day trading or playing with risky stocks, it's not so simple, but in the long term, the market consistently goes up up up outpacing inflation, even after taking crashes into account.
Bitcoin is not the stock market though, and behaves most similarly to a penny stock. With Bitcoin (as an investment), in the end, almost everyone will lose, except the select few people who were smart enough to both get in early, and get out before it was too late.

It's only up a shit ton for the people that got in a few months ago. I bet if mods shared traffic stats for the sub, you'd see that the majority of current subscribers came since the price was over 500.
