If you sold.

Well. If I saw the sky without any light pollution etc, and saw storms without any knowledge of why. I'd pray to something too��.

Is that what kids are calling bongs these days, "jewelry"?.

Futures opened almost on the day that it dropped.  Why is that not apart of these tulip conversations.
@_date: 2018-09-15 16:54:12
I thought the government is the biggest holder. They should just regulate it let cboe pump the guts out of it.. and good bye trillions of debt. Haha. That simple right?!
@_date: 2018-10-13 03:28:25
Never hear people talk at all about how shorting Bitcoin started around the same time as the pop.

I'm moving to the woods.

Man down by the river. Not sure if David spade not keeping composure makes me laugh.  Or when you see that excitement in Chris Farley's face when he knows hes breaking David spades composure.

That's three poops in one. Impressive

Call them ibits and pay off satoshi
@_date: 2018-10-13 05:02:29
Big money is planning the scheduled manipulation.. planning an unbeatable strategy to make everyone money.  And then China destroys it. Silk road before and just the thought of institutions looking at Bitcoin says hold to me.
@_date: 2018-10-26 19:00:43
Kinda like how blockbuster laughed at the idea of Netflix?
@_date: 2018-10-19 02:20:19
Cocaine for adults, Bitcoin= Adderall for kids, bakkt?
@_date: 2018-10-20 17:48:28
That was great. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 22:32:12
Nyse with it's 9-5 hours still unpredictable but, checking morning lunchtime and right before the bell is enough on a basic level.  Crypto anything can happen.  I just check when China wakes up and not sure why. Algo machines rule markets.
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:15:56
Get yourself some nice derivatives from Goldman Sachs
@_date: 2018-11-16 20:05:57
Yeah. That's a strong buy indicator.
@_date: 2018-11-18 01:32:49
I would check out your window for crown vics.

It's better than t.v.

Pretty sure the real Satoshi is smart enough that stepping up would lead to death within a year or sent to jail for who knows. Or the real Satoshi is the c.i.a. and we are following the plan to a "t".
@_date: 2018-11-21 22:13:42
Using the word "bro"..makes me shiver.
@_date: 2018-11-16 20:05:13
That's kinda awesome. You gotta love billionaires on their own agenda

Good sign
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:11:53
Algo machines, shorting. Using news as a scapegoat. The timeframe Bitcoin could be shorted was about the same time as the drop from 19k. But folks still say tulips. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:54:51
Pretty sure they can have bots to portray trends with searches. And then brings on fake news.  And pointless spikes. It's all speculation now. New world order is coming. One coin to rule them all. ��
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:07:32
All I hear is joker saying.... It's all apart of the plan
@_date: 2018-11-03 22:55:40
And just stared at the cooked shrimp with cocktail sauce
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:06:18
New world order.
@_date: 2018-11-24 04:36:06
I think they are..just slowing it down till they have the story prepared for the years to come. Keep the mob in the fog.
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:26:52
Buying at all time high and holding to nothing... I think sounds better than buying at all time high and selling at all time low. Just when it goes past last time all time high
@_date: 2018-11-05 02:52:55
Las Vegas should just go all crypto to stick with the times.

I thought iota was skynet

Social security numbers. Don't worry your credit companies will gladly mishandle them.

Isn't Venezuela the country with crazy amount of oil reserves. I could only guess why their country is getting all messed up.. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 02:18:28
The energy and those words were awesome
@_date: 2018-11-28 13:15:43
Literally days from the "crash" date from 20k l, shorting became available. Huge catalyst.
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:40:55
Oh. You said analyst.. phew.. now let's listen. No one knows. Say it with me ...no one.. except...

You hand over money you work for and they invest it for themselves. And you get a number on a screen at the atm.

Favorite comment on Reddit ..someone asked how to make ten grand in crypto.. someone said you start off with 100k and wait a couple months.

Vw is implementing iota in vehicles this year.. and the coordinator is going away

Reading the electronic gaming monthlies and seeing neo-geo gold for sale in the back for 500+. That's when imaginations were great.
@_date: 2018-12-16 04:06:13
Don't worry our taxes will take care of it.
@_date: 2018-12-13 19:45:41
How many?

All about the tangle!

Satoshi is like Jesus now. Not everyone will believe if someone comes forward. "You are not apart of the story I believe"!

I agree .. both parties are getting money stuffed in their pockets.. they vote for their own raises and have all the benefits that the "people" fight for. Welcome to the show
@_date: 2018-12-05 20:20:20
Sooo. If I have never changed my crypto back into Fiat. Then I never acquired capital gains? So no taxes right?
@_date: 2018-12-25 01:41:17
No iota tangle.

It's a flare word. Any fool can enter the conversation and say that. Price is great but,  It's sad knowing there's a chance of a decentralized technology for a global economy from the doorway of Bitcoin. But all these suckers can muster is bubble. This bubble is a phoenix of the ashes of 2008. Keep giving your money to the bank sheep.
@_date: 2018-12-13 19:39:44
One reason. The day it started plunging futures opened. The end. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:36:02
And where iota!? Second graph?

2020. Is literally a year and some change away. I just don't see the catalyst. Iot as well. I'm not on the sidelines .. I just don't see the change

So at 19000... He put a short position till now!... I get shorting is saying something will cost lower and you hedge a bet with a lender... But how the hell ... Can a bet this strong push the price ? Does the size of your short push the market down? 
@_date: 2018-12-21 12:19:18
Late to the party.
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:28:15
I'm very thankful for this. I'm no baller. Just wanted to plan for the bull market. Institutions have scared the sheep enough and taken a nice chunk of the market. Up we go .
