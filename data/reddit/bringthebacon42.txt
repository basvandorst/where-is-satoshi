I guess my question is, when someone sees (1 of 6 confirmations) when sending Bitcoin or something, who is actually doing the verifying. 
From the answers here, it seems like both miners and regular nodes actually verify transactions. And that they do it automatically. 
I have heard that sometime people can charge a small fee to verify transactions, how is is done?

What do you mean exactly when you say "the verification done by the miners is more important because only what ends up in the block chain counts in the end."  
Do you mean that if you run the QT but do not mine, the verifications are never really seen by the network?   
If i am running the QT, how do know if I am verifying transactions or not, helping or not? 
I appreciate all your guy's help.

So is mining for Bitcoin the same process as (or happens along with) verifying a transaction or are they different? 
I thought mining was solving tough equations to receive Bitcoin, basically just a means of distribution based on computer power/effort.
And I though verification was simply checking the block chain to make sure everything adds up. 
Is this correct? how does verification and mining intersect? 
I think, if mining generates new blocks, and blocks are records of transactions, then mining is essentially verifying transactions. 
But something seems off, I think I am wrong. Blocks are created every 10 minutes right?
if Bitcoin is created with every block, then why would the program need to increase difficulty to offset increases in computing power?    
I am missing a link or a few links.
