[37coins.com]( enables anyone to send bitcoin2sms or become a gateway and earn coin..   
I have a 2 domains Id like to sell if anyone is interested.
[bitcoin2sms.com]( just add your gateway number. (25 year  hosting)
[bitcoins2sms.com]( just the domain ..

Thanks for your honesty..  I saw their site and decided to become a gateway for my state..  I went as far as buying 2 domains bitcoin2sms.com and bitcoins2sms.com and put together a website now I have my doubts.. and offering up my projects /domains for sale..

I put together such a site but got discuraged with the lack of marketing / traction ..   I own the dev version of the software used to create the site. Sadly I sold it "tassker.com.. and picked up some bitcoin related domains in hopes of finding someone to partner with .. if anyone is intrested I would sell the domain with software jobs4bitcoins.com  Also have other decent bitcoin names im looking to dump .. if there is any intrest.
Edit:seems the website above got suspended go figure.
