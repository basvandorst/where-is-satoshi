Of course, that's what they do.
1. you need to acquire bitcoin from somewhere. Mt.Gox is a popular choise. After acquiring them, you'll send them to recipient.
2. Recipient sells the coins for local fiat (or USD). Again, Mt.Gox is a popular option for this. After the sale is done, the recipient would initiate a intl. bank transfer from Mt.Gox.

Worst. Idea. Ever.

That was bad performance. Amir didn't get his talking points across effectively, mainly because rapid talking speed and arrogant demeanor. Ed asked just the right questions, and had those questions been answered in properly constructed arguments (like daniel did) this would have been much more informative debate.
Now it was just crosstalk.

If you're just going to post the interior of tardis, at least have decency to aknowledge the Doctor!

Pics or it didn't happen. Renders are not accepted.
so you have this fancy cryonic shit and stirling (not sterling) engines and supercooled chips. And you claim to get comparable W/Ghs to butterfly labs? BULLSHIT!
Not to mention the fact that there is no information about your "company" anywhere on the site.
Scammers are gonna scam, don't fall to the hype.

I assume you're talking about Casascius coin. I would strongly advice against any cleaning, simply because the coin would lose it's patina (and possible numismatic value).

Considering the effect ASIC miners have on network hash rate, BTC value can only go up. Bigger hash rate = more secure network.

At least they seem trustworthy. Particularly their FAQ is very clear on the important questions on my mind :














@_date: 2013-05-28 04:34:36
They just mined a block and didn't include any transactions. Simple as that.
**Edit.** Compare it to the first block :

Dude, I hope you checked the Gold Pressed Latinum bars for fakes. There has been a lot of bars on sale (seems mostly by ferengi) and they're latinum from the outside; however the insides are replaced with berylliumoxide isotope 274b. While it's allmost the same atomical weight that latinum, it's highly dangerous to any human or klingon!
**edit.** I didn't even notice that you didn't include miners fee. Bad form! Remember the 2018 tribble invasion - just because some r'tard didn't include the fee. It took 9 years to confirm until we got rid of them.

Why could you not have private key on your (non smart) phone. Sign the tx on your phone, then sms it to the network.
You could not store blockchain on your device, but private keys - no problem.

I don't see how you would be able to achieve this with P2P currency.
I would imagine you'd need a central issuer.
Fiat pegged to BTC would be easier, but totally different beast.

Ooh! A genuine real life phone number!
No scammer could ever get a hold of one!

I had a similar problem some time back (I'm using armory). I then issued a double spend, and the problem was solved in next block (the original transaction went trough, the double spend did not).

And we have a winner!

I much rather assume that they're founded by a group of former East Anglian Monty Python re-enactors, or such. MtGox was an MtG card exchange after all...

Well, you could pay your heating bills by mining bitcoin at least. GPU rigs especially put out a lot of heat (if you take 1000W out of the socket, you get 1000W worth of heat).

Brasso is an abrasive cleaning product (silica powder 15-20%).
It will make your coins shiny. I will also quarantee it will destroy any patina the coin has.

No it doesn't. It might eliminate central banks, but not commercial banks. You can even do fractional reserve with it.
