That's like.. your opinion.. man
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:34:38
So it isn't the time to buy right now, is it?
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:09:35
People have been buying the dips since it started falling.
People bought the dip at 19000, 
People bought the dip at 18000, 
People bought the dip at 17000, 
You get the picture. 
Every single time, those who are HODLing kept saying that this is the time. How is this time any different?
@_date: 2018-06-14 16:37:12
Yes, but you are forgetting a crucial disclaimer used by Finance Companies all the time:
Past performance does not guarantee future Returns.
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:26:40
Great. Has Bitcoin been holding at any heavy support consistently? 
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:02:27
I am fully onboard with that logic.
It's the speculators who I dislike.
To me, Bitcoin is worth zero. I never bought it, I never will.
@_date: 2018-06-14 00:52:14
Please don't pull numbers out of nowhere. Bitcoin is worth 0. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:38:17
Since the day it crossed 10k, I have been telling all my friends interested in Bitcoin NOT to buy it. Many did buy. Some cashed out around 17k. Most didn't. 
They are still stuck to this day with dreams of another 20k rally.
I highly doubt this rally will come. If it does, it won't sustain. Bitcoin is not lucrative for the normal individual except as a source of speculation.

Cost price is relevant if the supply is heavily dependent on the miners. I am sure a huge chunk of Bitcoin is already with speculators. 
To them, cost price means nothing. It's their buying price and their ability to take losses that actually matters to them.

@_date: 2018-11-21 01:01:51
If you want hope, yes, it will recover.
If you want truth, there's no guarantee. Investments are meant to be made sensibly. Any investment source that's as volatile as the Bitcoin is a strict no no unless you are trading options.
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:35:43
That's not how store of value is defined though. That's how investments are defined.
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:13:34
If there was a why to Bitcoin, I would have invested. There's no why to the price of Bitcoin. There's no inherent value, no base price, no true value. I cannot give reason for it being at 0 or for it being at 1 million. Hence, it's a very bad investment 
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:19:42
Of course it can.
But will it? There's no guarantee that it will. Will I get against it going up? Hell no. Will I bet that it will go up? Hell no.
If there was an option I could buy to sell it at current price when it will end up at 0, I would buy that option. But other than that, I don't want anything to do with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:17:05
From Wikipedia,
A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved.[citation needed]More generally, a store of value is anything that retains purchasing power into the future.
I really don't think Bitcoin has succeeded in being a predicably useful store of value. Someone who purchased it last year at 20k has lost over 75% of his value.
So, no, Bitcoin is not a (good?) store of value. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:50:21
Exactly. Once the price stabilizes, if you need to send money anywhere in the world, buy Bitcoin and send it. 
There's no other common use of Bitcoin I can see for now.
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:45:19


As I said


Not really, if it can't store value and keeps either falling quickly or rising quickly. It lacks stability and hence, it's not a store of value for anyone.
Again, currency needs stability and mass usage. It lacks both.


Gold has value if the modern civilization falls. Bitcoin doesn't. Call it internet gold and many will agree. Gold 2.0 - Nope.


Till governments allow it to be so. 


Ummm.. no.


Yes, as is any new technology


Only for those who want to think of it as so.
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:47:42
Also remember, for every Bitcoin bought for holding, there's a smart seller with a different attitude. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 04:58:19
He has two pairs of Bitcoin. Dunno how that is relevant though.
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:07:27
Holding isn't a great strategy for something like Bitcoin imo. It's a gamble. You throw the money you didn't need at it and wait. It either grows in size a lot or it gets halved. 
If you want your money back, get out. It's still your money, just a bit or a lot lesser. You can invest it smartly in real stocks or invest it in you by gaining some financial/trading knowledge. 
Remember that one bird in hand is better than two in the bush.
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:51:26
When it is backed by something, it will not be valueless anymore. And then, it's price will stabilize just as that of nearly all other currencies.
Otherwise it's another speculative asset.
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:29:30
I seriously doubt this survey.
I may be biased but in India, most people I know would not take Bitcoin over Indian rupee or USD. 
If it said, 10-20%, I would have agreed. But 60% is overshooting it by miles.
@_date: 2018-11-16 17:13:30
It's less than 2 Bitcoins. And in Bitcoin terms, it's not that much.
@_date: 2018-11-27 16:47:46
What pessimism? I just stated a fact.
@_date: 2018-03-26 09:32:57
Even Nothing is valuable with government backing. For example, US treasury bonds. The government is a stable entity. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:49:46
Because there's no bottom or ceiling to Bitcoin, it can fall as much as needed or rise a lot of enough people are greedy. As there's no intrinsic value, the price will never make sense.
@_date: 2018-03-26 02:50:52
Ummm... And what's the value of Bitcoin?
Why is it$20000 one day and$10000 within a few days? Did the US dollar have that big a fall so quickly? Or did it have the big rise so quickly?
Bitcoin is as valuable as you and others believe it is.
@_date: 2018-03-30 07:37:11
No. Not at all. 
No one purchases anything based on amount of computing power spent. 
No seller prices items in Bitcoins. 
As Bitcoin has to always be converted in other currency before a general purchase, it's value will always be considered in terms of other currencies. 
And as Bitcoin's value keeps falling or increasing a lot suddenly, it is not a good store of value. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:05:08
And a drop of 70% is worse than most financial assets you could have invested in.
Selectively looking at only one side assuming you will choose the correct time to invest is your bias.
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:38:07
Yes. Yet I don't need to exchange my currency inside my country to buy stuff. 
I can buy something that cost Indian rupees 10 at Indian rupees 10.. 2 months later.
Worst case scenario, it's now 11 rupees. 
It won't be 20 rupees or 2 rupees suddenly, for most items. And I don't need to buy it in USD or Pakistani rupee. 
Hope you get my point as a common man wanting to use a normal currency, not a speculative asset for daily purchases. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:47:15
Where did I mention selling or buying Bitcoin?
I trade derivatives in equity markets to grow my investments.
I personally find Bitcoin worthless, yet am interested in it to understand how bubbles work and what logic people use to stay invested in these bubbles. That's why I am on this group.
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:14:55
Never short a crazy item. If there a long term option though, I would jump in like crazy.
@_date: 2018-03-30 06:40:47


Yeah, my post would give that meaning. My bad. 
I meant that if someone could really predict the markets, they would be billionaires.
@_date: 2018-03-28 05:56:22


No, that's one of the main criterias of anything that is considered as a store of value. You using it as such doesn't make it a universal store of value.


Yes. It's basically meant to be a currency. Yet, today, it's a speculative asset. Those who enter it enter it for Gains and those who believe in it are HODLing, in their own terms. Neither are what you use currency for.


Neither is likely. Yet, when you compare with gold, you have to compare in that way. And if the financial system falls, Bitcoin can't be converted with anything. Mass adoption of it won't happen. Countries would simply use their legal power to restart a new currency, even if virtual.


Governments have enough measures to track crypto. In fact, hard currency is much less trackable. Which was my point.


Yeah. Okay.
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:14:49
Effectively keeping the value the same.


@_date: 2018-02-06 09:48:18
So, the adults are bickering and yelling at each other for a loss of 10% while the kids (HODLers) are seeing a beautiful thing even after losing nearly 70%?
Damn lucky to be an adult.

Past performance is not indicative of future returns.

Bitcoin may zoom up. Bitcoin may crash. If anyone could predict it, they would be self made billionaires in a matter of a few weeks.

TIL there was no gold before 1953.
@_date: 2018-03-28 06:28:51


Lots of people believe in flat earth too. Doesn't make it right. 
I agree that many people use it as a store of value but due to its instability, it is not a store of value by definition.


No. Most people speculate to gain when the prices increase. They will sell and convert back from Bitcoin to USD or their home currency. Hence, they are not entering it as a currency. Yes, it's meant to be a currency. Yet, to most people, it isn't. 


True. Yet the government can trace it. In the end, it's money. Has to be taken out from somewhere and deposited. Plus, the records of the transaction are everywhere. 


When did I dispute that? It's the first. It's not unique anymore.

@_date: 2018-02-06 03:13:19
Sorry that it happened to you. 
In the future, please invest carefully. 
Learn the difference between intrinsic value and market value. Don't listen to hype. NEVER go for get rich quick schemes no matter how great they sound.
If something's growing at 20% a week, you better believe it will fall even faster. 
You just learnt a life lesson. Take it positively.
@_date: 2018-03-30 07:28:45
Value is value. 
A dollar is valuable as it can buy certain amount of a certain item. 
So is the Indian rupee. So is the Euro or the yen.
Bitcoin, if stable, would be the same. 
If I spend 8 hours of my day every day for a month, I receive some value from my employer. I would never want that value to be given to me in Bitcoin. Because that value may drop or rise suddenly. And I can't risk that amount. If I had to gamble, I would certainly go for Bitcoin and speculate that it may increase. 
Hence, Bitcoin is not a good store of value.

And did electrify costs drop by half in a matter of months? Or rise by hundreds of percentage in few months before that? Sunk cost is not backing. It's simply sunk cost.
Admit it, the price is arbitrary. Like any speculative asset, it's price is determined by what others are willing to pay for it. UNLIKE national currencies.
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:11:52
Gold is an item people buy for use or as store of value.
Most Bitcoin purchases recently were done for speculative gain. There's no use of Bitcoin but as a currency (if even that).
Even if there's no more mining, there's only 21 million Bitcoin as people keep pointing out. Either people will sell or they will not sell what they hold.
I am willing to bet many people will sell their Bitcoin to avoid further loss even if the price falls below 5000 just as many who purchased above 15k are selling it for lower prices, at a loss 
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:25:50
The one above me who pointed out only about the increase, who I then showed the second side.
As one side was already highlighted, I didn't need to highlight it again. 
Plus, you are again assuming you would be able to time your purchase and sale perfectly.

Sure. But market value is not the reason why.

Why does he need to do that? The market value of the coin doesn't matter. How commonly it's accepted by the masses will determine which coin wins.

There are literally hundreds of shares you could trade in.

In most cases, monetary inflation follows price inflation. No matter what the OP is talking about, the end result is that the consumer gets stability in the short to medium term. This is something that Bitcoin doesn't have as of now.
@_date: 2018-04-06 05:40:33
Hasn't happened yet, won't happen anytime in the future as per my understanding.
However, assuming this does happen, the answer is to invest your money instead of saving it. This is something I actively do. My money is invested in share market earning me good returns. 
Bitcoin is too unstable to invest in. If I did have to invest in something other than shares, it would be gold and land. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:56:11
So, inflation is BAD!!!
But Bitcoin losing its purchase power from 20000 dollars to 7000 dollars or lower is nothing to think about. Even when this happened in a matter of few weeks.
@_date: 2018-04-02 17:24:18
Sure. Time will prove me wrong then. Chill out.
@_date: 2018-04-06 05:12:39




The OP is the one starting the comparison by pointing out that the dollar lost it's purchasing power.




If it happens.
Speaking for myself, I have no use for Bitcoin. I am perfectly happy with the Indian rupee. It has served me well for 27 years and it is stable enough that I don't need to worry about it. Bitcoin serves no purpose to me.
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:04:57
If I could predict the future, I would. To me and many others like me (including Warren Buffett), the value of Bitcoin is zero. To others, it has value. Let's see which side finds out they were wrong. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 16:04:03
That's your bias.
As long as he says what you think to be true, you agree with him.
As soon as he says something you think to be false, you disagree.
To be honest, Bitcoin doesn't have any value and it's far too overvalued even at current price imo. Before you downvote, it's my opinion. You are free to disagree.
@_date: 2018-04-02 17:47:55
Some bubbles last longer than others. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:59:22
The end goal of any currency is to purchase something of value from the market.
Saying that inflation reduced purchasing power is implying that you can buy less stuff using same amount of dollars. So, something you used to buy for 10 dollars now costs 11. That's inflation. You lost purchasing power.
Bitcoin could purchase 20000 dollars worth of value at ita peak. It cannot do so now. It can only purchase worth 6-7000 dollars. You lost purchasing power.
