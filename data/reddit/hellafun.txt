So what is the point of this? To attempt to destroy the market and ecosystem of a company because they don't want to be involved with bitcoin? Is that what the bitcoin community is about... abusive bullying behavior toward anything that doesn't embrace bitcoin? What a lovely attitude.
Personally I think it's better to simply no longer give them our business.

Lol, who told you Macintosh was his baby? He only got on board with it after it was clear LISA was going to be dead in the water.
What about your argument am I misrepresenting? Perhaps I simply didn't understand your phrasing? I'll admit the snide "And people liked that." you ended with set me off a bit. If you were not trying to say that Jobs deserved credit for Macintosh, a project Raskin started and named and spearheaded until Jobs squeezed him out, what were you trying to say? Also, out of interest, where do you get your information from?

Ah, yeah, that's a bit over a pound, I don't usually have nearly that much on hand. Still, I think it's best if I stay where I can buy it at a store and not have to fear going to the pokey. :)
Thanks for providing some detail!

From what I understand, Singapore is a pretty cool place to do business and to live, as long as you can abide by their restrictive laws. Unfortunately my lifestyle is such that I would break at least a few laws a day there, so for now it's just a dream.

So what you're saying is MS did not have an enormous head start, but was founded by some very clever business people and Apple just screwed themselves during the time MS was first building an empire? I agree. But that is not at all the same thing as having an enormous head start. As I mentioned before, the home computer market is one that Apple invented, and then lost. Twice, really, since they were also first to market with a graphical user interface. And that second loss? You can't blame that on the marketing. The original Mac has one of the most loved and respected ad campaigns of all time.

Yeah, not like the normal banking industry at all. :/
And as for scams on the internet in the early 1990s? Yes. So. Much. As others have mentioned scams are as old as gullible human beings, and early 1990s (pre-www) internet was no exception. Back then people mostly used bbs-like services (also bbs, but the only shenanigans going on on bbs' was piracy/file-trading) like CompuServe, Prodigy, and the most popular of them all, especially with barely computer literate people AOL.
AOL had public and private chatrooms that were quite popular (chat was the killer app of the early 1990s internet) there was a whole community of traders that used private rooms to trade and collect warez (is that term still in use? if not, it just means pirated stuff) and sometimes phished credit card numbers. Speaking of which, that was the most common version of fraud that would occur on AOL, phishing. It worked like this: the phisher would go into a public chatroom and send a private message to everyone in the room. It would be something shamefully bad/fake like "Hi, I am Joe Blow with AOL Account Services. There has been an attempt to breach your account. To keep your account secure we've changed your password to: HUNTER2 If you would prefer to use your old password just reply with it here." And... that would work. 
Not with everyone of course, most would call the person on their bullshit, sometimes people would report them to TOS (what everyone referred to AOL admins as) to get the account banned, but it didn't matter because the phisher would have gotten at least a few legit passwords that they could then use later to log on as the people they'd phished. If the phisher got lucky, they would get access to a master account which would allow the phisher to create a new sub-account that the account holder wouldn't know about until a month later when their absurdly high AOL bill arrived (AOL charged by the hour[minute? I don't recall exactly] for connectivity back then). It also gave up billing details (until phishing got so common AOL was forced to take measures to protect their customers' data), so lots of phished credit card numbers were easily had.
People would buy/sell/trade these credit card numbers and sometimes use them to buy things they would have shipped to addresses they didn't actually live at so if anyone was tracking the package they wouldn't get busted. And actually, that hasn't changed at all... it's just become more difficult to secure the numbers... unless you have underpaid retail/food service employees with access to a credit-card machine that can print the days' receipts, then it's still super easy... but then that is not internet fraud so not really germane I suppose.

No, brilliant people working for NeXT and Apple did.
In the case of bringing the GUI to the mainstream, he specifically did not do that. His baby was LISA. Remember LISA? Yeah, no one else does either. What you probably remember is the Macintosh. That's the internal project that was competing with LISA. It was the one that DIDN'T have Jobs' approval (although he glommed on once it was clear LISA was a failure and Mac was going to be something quite epic). It's the project he tried to kill at first; but when LISA was a colossal failure, it was Macintosh that saved the company. Let's please give credit where credit is due OverlordXenu; it's Jeff Raskin, Bill Atkinson, and  Andy Hertzfeld we need to thank for bringing GUI to the mainstream.
As for NeXT? No, ripping off an OS that had existed since the 70s by no means made computers pretty radically different than what had existed before. On the other hand, using his business acumen to sell the good bits of that failure of a company to Apple as part of the condition of his return was truly inspired.
But thank you for proving what a brilliant marketer Jobs really was; there are so many folks like yourself willing to give him credit that far exceeds what he's actually accomplished.

That was all immediately to the right of the question. I know he spent more words on Bitcoin than he did fiat currency... but still, he did answer.

I dunno man. I didn't write comment so I can't explain nor will I defend the dramatic flair in it. I suspect he was talking about the wikileaks controversy, where goverment DID "ask" these payment providers to suspend payments to wikileaks, which is why I provided the link. I thought your question was a genuine one, not an attempt at a nitpicky argument over someone's flair for the dramatic. I was just trying to help. If you want to have the nitpicky argument, I am afraid you're barking up the wrong tree, I have no interest in defending someone else's comment. Apologies for trying to be helpful. :/

Oh, agreed, no judgements... well, maybe I think people who bought the maverick line are a bit foolish. But certainly none about Jobs being top-notch at marketing or capitalism; I can only hope to be so good myself.
@_date: 2014-02-06 02:54:00
I don't know why you got downvoted for this; your statement was true even when that ad campaign was first around. Apple lost its' maverick spirit in the 80s around the time the board kicked Jobs out. Although he came back to spearhead the company in the late 90s, what he came back to was a publicly traded company, and the reality of the situation was, as a publicly traded company they have a responsibility first and foremost to be profitable in order to please their investors. 
Jobs is one of the best minds in the history of marketing though, and so when he returned he worked hard to make the multi-billion dollar (and yes, they had a fraction of the value in 1997 that they do now, but they still were worth billions), then already 20 year old company seem like the fresh outsider upstart that prized maverick thinking. That was all marketing, not a genuine position of the company; the board would have kicked Jobs out for a second time if he had been seriously trying to pull some maverick shit. By the time he returned in 1997 he was a truly skilled marketer and a consummate capitalist.

Putting names on those fucking bottles has been the best viral marketing campaign for them ever. I cringe every time I see one posted, since the posters are just playing into the hands of coke's marketing team. The whole point of putting names on the bottles was to get folks to advertise coke for free, and it's working tremendously well.

There won't always be free sites if the methods of monitizing free content don't work. The best you'll find if/when that comes to pass are skilled amateurs and semi-pros working to build their portfolio, and the ocassional personal piece dashed off by a pro out of pure passion.
You may be forgetting that almost all the content you read online these (well, perhaps not you personally, but the general internet user) days is written by people who are compensated to do so. They wouldn't be researching or writing the posts and articles if there wasn't a paycheck attached. Lots of very well written content already exists only behind paywalls, so it's not a stretch to believe that as users on the internet actively work to ensure that free content can't be effectivly monitized that more and more content will go this way.
Out of interest, do you do you job without pay? If you do not, why would you expect journalists and bloggers to pursue their career path without pay (which is effectively what you are asking for in an ad-free but content is still free world)?

Sure, simple fix: "no co-ops". That most likely won't affect the vast preponderance of their business but will shut these guys out overnight.
Why are people trying so hard to fight Apple on this? Just take your business elsewhere, Apple CLEARLY does not want bitcoin users as customers. Why try to force the issue?

Paypal regularly steals money from its' users, I can see how it's an incredible service for the stockholders and principals of eBay, but you'll have to explain how a company that regularly suspends accounts and holds money for no discernible reason and with little chance for restitution is good for thier users.

People can't respect that because reporters are assholes who care about making themselves famous. I suspect it was different decades ago, but nowadays it's about making headlines to get the reporter's name out there; if potentially ruining someones life or even getting them killed is a consequence of what they write, who cares? They got the headline, right?

Ah, I assumed it would have something there. [Here's a wired article from 2010 that discusses some of what was referring to]( If you're curious about greater specifics, just search for "wikileaks paypal". To my knowledge, this is the only time that Paypal has been the US government's bitch so directly and publicly.

Wait, how did Microsoft have an enormous head-start? Apple and Microsoft were both founded within a year of each other. Apple more or less invented the home user personal computer. Xerox invented the graphical operating system, which both Apple and MS swiped. Windows 1.0 was released more than a year after the first Mac and Lisa computers hit the market. That was in 1985/1986 by the way, a decade after both companies were first founded.
How exactly was it that Microsoft had such an enormous head start? The personal computer market was created by Apple, it was theirs to lose and guess what? They did exactly that. Apple computers are a niche product and they always have been. Their mp3 players dominated that market for about the last half of its existence, and their phones were mainstream for a few years, but they are becoming niche too.

He said he was let go, not fired. My guess is he got some kind of severance and didn't leave on bad terms (based on that wording and his follow-up tweets). Chances are since he has such a rare/specialized skillset that he would be overpaid for any other role in the company, and more than likely wouldn't want to go from cutting-edge cryptocurrency work to something comparatively dull/easy.
