And this is why you make payouts often, backup your wallet.dat, and store it in multiple locations.  It's like keeping your cash under your mattress.

Ahhhh I don't know what this does!

Yeah I ditched for deepbit. Kinda sad this is how they run their pool. No respect for their users.

I think even the sight of 100 duck sized horses would be worth paying my bitcoins

Yeah same here.  I just have some money and well I guess I could buy a new GPU.

GPU mining is far from dead.

Your wallet.dat only holds the unique identifier that tells the client, as it reads the block chain, which transactions pertain to you.  Therefore, any backup, made at anytime of the wallet.dat will work as a backup to the wallet, as that is all you need.

Because you have added Bitcoin as a payment method I can guarantee you I will buy reddit gold at least once.

That's awesome.

What's your hash rate?

When I first read the title I thought 'no way' but after reading it I now couldn't agree more. I think of my using of coins as my 'donation' to Bitcoin because I want to see it succeed. 
Keep up the spending!
