Like you're five?
It's all real complex stuff man, with loads of confusing jargon and men who think they have bigger balls than others. Essentially, trying to make fast bucks from little or no creative input to humanity, however, I've seen some funny shit here over the past day.

The picture is framed in the moment before the whalebear bites the head off the bitcoiner. Or maybe bitcoiner tempers the beast by throwing fiat into it's mouth. It'll be back.
does have a talent, however.

Well, it was a long shot, Tony.


It gets worse here everyday, 
Ya learn ta live like an animal, 
In the jungle where we play, 
If you got a hunger for what you see, 
You'll take it eventually, 
You can have anything you want, 
But you better not take it from me
