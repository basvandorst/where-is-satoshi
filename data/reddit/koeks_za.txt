I did that! The company I work for didn't take to my idea "CryptoMobi". Basically we do once off mobile payment (we deal with subscription normally) and we send bitcoins. The issue is in the mobile industry the network operator takes half, then business costs which only leaves you with 40% of original value to convert. My idea was for this situation of funds building up on contracts that expire.

What advantage is it for the government if it can't control it. They want complete control.

While I can see it up for abuse I wouldn't mind something for the 500Gb of traffic used monthly.

The gold was bought and paid for with money where the individual payed income tax or whatever. Why do they get 45% of something that should be passed down like the other stuff. Government is mafia. At most they should only pay and VAT tax if converting gold to cash.

Good, we need a real fork to revive BTC.

Yea, idiot.

Pity, LTC should be the real BTC. It works, is cheap and instant unlike BTC
