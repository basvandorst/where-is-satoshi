A sensible prediction would be anywhere in the range of $28,000 - $37,000.

I'm from India and unfortunately, Bitcoin isn't exactly a topic of conversation here. About 1 in 10 people that you expect will know actually know about it. That said, we believers, while small, are a a passionate bunch. This news hasn't caused any outrage yet, I don't think it will. Our Govt. knows us too well to make sure to distract us first with BS. That said, Bitcoin is growing here, albeit only as a security &amp; might even become a trend by Q2 2018 if it continues to surprise everyone like this.

Invest all in altcoins that are down rn. Stay away from BTC at all this weekend. Hodl any you may have &amp; be sure to diversify. Monitor BCH &amp; dump 20% of your available funds into it when it dips.

This is bad. If RBI declines then I guess now is a good time to sell. If they accept then they're definitely gonna fuck it up. Looks like we've got no option but to sell, either today or later. Unfortunate.

u/ur8moms the time has come my friend
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:34:07
That's perfect. And by BCH I meant Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:34:28
$6.5K &amp; $7K here. Though in my country it trades at a ~$500 premium over int'l price so it has been at $8K+ for a while now :)

You own a bit of bitcoin. It loses value so does your share. Except if you sell you make that loss permanent. If you don't there's still a chance things could turn around. Best to hodl &amp; diversify investments so as to not keep all your eggs in one basket.

Wednesday. It'll be pretty bad till Christmas. January 2018 will be the grand finale b/w BTC &amp; BCH &amp; BTC will likely come out on top. General advice rn: Hodl what you have, don't invest more. Diversify your portfolio by putting in on the discounted altcoins and put some that you can afford to lose into BCH for when it hits $2K tomorrow hopefully.

Just saw a collective 1,200 BTC in back-to-back buy orders on Bitfinex.
Whales buying in, you should too.

[Here]( it is.
So, either Amazon will start accepting payments in Bitcoin, or they're opening an exchange of their own. I'm guessing the former. Either way, this is a big deal.
[Here's]( a backup in case the tweet gets deleted.

Right on. Based on this, can you also explain what's in the future of Bitcoin, if it has one at all.

*Something weird is happening.*
Why has Bitcoin become impervious to major news such as Lightening surpassing 1,000 open channels on the mainnet.
Normally this should've had a disrupting effect on the price, yet the price continues to follow a downtrend.

Better, use [CoinPaper]( it displays a live wallpaper with BTC/USD price chart for set time periods. Available on Android, can't confirm availability on iOS. There's Coin Tick for macOS which does what you were asking for.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:31:28
And what do you do when there's blood in the streets?
You buy more.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:37:20
Could be, it's within the realm of possibilities.
Requesting other Amazon Sellers reading this to confirm.

Perhaps he's just trying to artificially inflate the price a bit so he can cash out?
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:27:50
I'll take a number 4

Just caught [a glimpse of whale activity on Bitfinex]( how do you explain this?

Is Segwit cheaper because it downsizes the size of the transaction on the network thus attracting a lower fee?
