I’m not even going to ask for 1, can I please have .1?

SoCal in the Oc area

Bitcoin checks both of those things...

I think many people will be amazed about where bitcoin is going imo. We are at the early early start of a bull run, when you take into account past bitcoin cycles and the block reward size getting cut in half around the summer of 2020. Factor in US elections, trade war, looming recession, and the possibility of maybe a war in the Middle East, and it starts to look as if this might be one of the better bull runs bitcoin will experience. Also institutional investors are already buying but the media won’t really talk about that. I would be taking advantage of all these dips to buy more.

Yes definitely, I’ve been stacking sats for a while now!
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:47:17
Yeah fiat is trash

Couldn’t agree more, although I do live rent free and have very little expenses since I’m still in school and live with parents. I’ve been in the space for quite a while as well now and have withstood the high fluctuations. I do still put aside cash from my paychecks to save as well so that I am able to cope with the volatility.

Lol all I had to do was look up the definition of currency to change my mind. Maybe you should as well.

The network has 8X since 2017, my evidence is from the trend that has been going on for the past decade.
@_date: 2019-09-08 20:20:05
not necessarily, one day the U.S. dollar will eventually die like every fiat currency has. Not anytime soon imo, but there will come a point where pricing bitcoin/precious metals/essentials to living in fiat wont even make sense, because it will literally be worthless.
@_date: 2019-09-08 23:57:22
Your being very ignorant. Yeah of course past performance doesn’t indicate future performance. The higher the demand, factored in with the scarcity, does mean a higher price. I’ve been in the community for a very long time, I’m just gonna leave it at that.
@_date: 2019-09-08 22:59:25
Lmao as new as I am...you don’t even know who your talking to.
@_date: 2019-09-08 22:42:50
^^^ I already listed some events above. Are you bullish or bearish bitcoin just curious? I don’t think the government will be able to fix the mess we’re in but it’s ok to disagree. I respect your argument, I guess time will tell who’s right. Should we set up a reminder?
@_date: 2019-09-09 19:17:54
I’m talking about assuming someone online who you don’t know is new to a subject. I never said the demand would increase “just because”. I gave my reasons why. If you wanna continue this convo just dm me.
@_date: 2019-09-08 21:32:29
Yeah anyone who buys bitcoin is speculating. I’m just predicting based off future events what the price maybe can achieve
@_date: 2019-09-08 20:13:06
Next year imo will be absolutely insane fundamentally speaking. We got the block reward size halving, US presidential elections, instability around the world growing (Iran, Argentina, Venezuela, and China trade war), and negative interest rates are starting to pop up in more countries. This is the perfect storm, and you will be very happy that you bought bitcoin so early.
@_date: 2019-09-08 22:37:53
Yeah it’s gonna increase
@_date: 2019-09-08 21:35:26
You mean does* only shrink the inflation rate. The stock to flow ratio will be increased. The supply of bitcoin coming into circulation will be decreased, which can and will have an effect on the price if demand stays the same.
@_date: 2019-09-08 20:22:42
excellent way to explain it!
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:32:26
Wouldn’t be surprised at all
@_date: 2019-05-12 04:42:13
Well if the internet goes down we’re screwed anyways because we already live in an almost cashless society.
@_date: 2019-05-21 20:27:53
Coinbase already makes it really easy
