What is bch/bcc value proposition?
I can buy things with ether with several second confirmation OR, if i want, I can move larger sums using bitcoin and get 6 confirms in an hour (albeit, using larger fees). 
Whether it costs me 1c on bch or 10c on ethereum makes almost no difference, besides, using larger and larger blocks seems to be a third grader logic, but I digress.
@_date: 2019-07-03 20:45:51
Decided to buy...they are sold out for a while already.

If bitcoin will be around 15-30K for the next 6 mo, i can easily foresee ETF starting at 1:1000 to btc (at $15-30), therefore for simplicity of a comparison making mbtc a default on exchanges, etc.
@_date: 2018-09-09 23:10:52
What confusion?
I can see only one pertinent thing-it costs $50 to settle.
It is probably disclosed somewhere, but I did not look it up.
So, if you are buying a small number of shares, it would affect your average price.
Other than that, I don't see any confusion whatsoever.
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:33:23
I was curios enough to calculate:
average 3 mo T-bills rate since 1928: 4.24%
plugging in years and inflation rates from here ( ), here is an answer:
If you invested $20 in 3mo T-bills in 1928 and kept re-investing with zero fees, you would have $57 in 1928 buying power equivalent in 2018. A small positive return.

This actually shows a sad state of affairs in US in the last 20 years. 
~~Why? Because average family earned about the same $$ in 1998 vs 2016/17 while inflation resulted in $100 1998 $ being equal to $154.6  in 2018. In order to stay still, you would have needed 90K family income in 2018 to just have the same value. It did not happen, indicating that average family got much poorer.~~

I specifically signed up on reddit to comment on this.
Gemini is ridiculous.
I am waiting almost two weeks already for them to process my documents (instead of 1-3 days).
I contacted their support and all I got was that they got a lot of applicant..blah blah. You cannot speak to anyone there as well. 
I feel totally unwelcomed, but maybe this is their idea of customer service.
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:53:29
Go with GDAX/Coinbase if you have an account already, otherwise more or less the same.
However, I am waiting for two weeks on Gemini after I sent them my full documents. Bizarro.
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:53:20
Don't use Gemini.
They would make you feel totally unwelcomed.
I sent my documents almost two weeks ago and got no response so far. Customer service says (after taking a few days to respond) that they have many applicants.
They suppose to respond in up to 3 days, but i have NO response in four times longer and counting.

Your bitcoin will be rehypothecated (aka sold and lent multiple times by blockfi).
They reserve a right to give you back the bitcoin (not yours of course, but same amounts) within 7 days on request.

Why do people care so much about ETFs?
Didn't futures fiasco teach you anything?
I prefer to think about bitcoin and crypto as lifeforms with a different molecular chirality (incompatible with fiat world in principle). We should exist by ourselves and fiat by themselves. 
Some interchange (on the virtual border) is enough. That's all.

Disagree. From what I have seen with futures, ETFs would just bring more bitcoin oppression. I am 100% against it. 
Fiat world will crash, it is inevitable, proven by math. I don't want this crash to be affecting crypto in the future. We are dinosaurs and mammals, respectively, or Neanderthals and Homo sapiens. No need to interbreed.

Liquidate one or two bitcoins.
After you did, tell your wife that you had it/them (one or two) since 2013.
See what the reaction will be.
it would be either:
1. GREAT!  we now have cash to do [whatever]
2. Why did you do that? Bitcoin was going up [unlikely since she is not tech savvy].
3. Bitcoin what? [in this case, just say that you had an investment long time ago, but now cashed it in]. Forget about telling about the other 198-199 for a while.
A couple things to consider:
1. just noticed that you got this before getting married, so you could just keep it ~~is this a communal property a.k.a did you buy them before or after you got married?~~
2. largish cap gains (if you sell a couple) might bump you up in tax bracket-check the brackets before doing this.
EDIT: To people who suggest to buy a house in outright cash (350K)-bad idea. Why do you want to sell an asset that gave so much growth and buy an asset that gives low growth and you have to pay taxes on yearly? Get a nice mortgage, maybe sell enough btc to make a downpayment+first year or two tax.
TL;DR do a trial with one-two, see how it will be perceived. Remember one thing though: she most likely will tell EVERYONE she knows (family, friends, etc.). That said, I tell my SO everything, but she is very smart and tech savvy.

The peak at $259 was a part of a secular bull from $2 bottom to $1160 peak. 
Therefore, no need to make it a separate crash. 
We are now in the tail end of the third epoch of bitcoin (each roughly coinciding with halvings):
Epoch 1: bitcoin up from zero to $32, down to $2 
Epoch 2: bitcoin up from $2 to $1160, down to $150
Epoch 3: bitcoin up from $150 to $19873, down to ???

He is a reincarnation of Henry Blodget (albeit Henry is still with us), who was absolutely right (even very modest) about the future value of Amazon in 1998. 
The only question is when. 
He proposes (and I agree) that it would be when millennials will reach their thirties, so in 10-15 years. His final target is 10mil!. Wow.

Yes, for the time being, but it was also less than $1k and more than $15K in the last 12 mo. 
Heck, bch was 9k for a millisecond and now it is about 900 something; eth was 1400, now 600.
These things are volatile.

I certainly don't expect it, however who knows what will be the size of that debt in 15 years. I would rather focus on wealth instead, though.
Total wealth was 280tril in 2017. At 6.5% growth a year, it could reach $720 trillion by 2033.
The trouble is that debt was increasing faster than wealth in the last 20 years. 
I hope that btc/crypto would reverse the trend.

Well, prior experience tells me that I better listen to him.
When bitcoin was at $500-600 in 2014, he said that it will be 10K by 2018 and IT IS.
His current prediction does sound "funny", but so was a prediction of 20X fold appreciation in four years.

if you don't know, then you don't know fiat finance.
BM is very sharp despite his granddaddy appearance.
Stellar record, examples:
1. Beat S&amp;P500 for  record time in a row (something like 15 years).
It's unheard of in fiat where 80-90% don't beat S&amp;P in ONE year.
2. Invested early in AMZN and stuck with it during 2000-2002 down turn, predicting great things to come. It happened, but was not obvious at all in early 2000s when many people expected AMZN to fail.

I suggest to remove April 2013 peak/trough as it was clearly a part of the bull from $2 low to 1147 high (even your numbers indicate it).
This way, the data would be much easier to comprehend.
