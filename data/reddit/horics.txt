**(update : They have not sent the money yet.)**
I wrote a comment on facebook, but they deleted it and prohibited writing a comment. 57K SGD has been missing for 2 months. Support ticket is not working and the founder Rick is not replying as well.
I reported to Singaporean police, Aussie police and Aussie fair trading org. Now I am searching a lawyer for a complaint.

The followings are your mail.

I'm sorry you withdrawal is taking so long. We are having issues with some banks holding up our payments, so if support said your payment has been sent, then that will be the case. I will ask the team to see why it is taking so long.
Kind regards,

I am checking with support. I don't have access to those systems as I work in social media.
You will get a reply later today. Sorry I can't give you more info right now.

Thank you for your email.
We’re experiencing some banking delays due to very big fraudulent transaction.
The banks are investigating this along with us.
As a result, they’ve put a hold on funds until this is resolved.
We expect this to be completely resolved in the next 2 to 3 days.
The banks have assured us that the service will return to normal within days.
Please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience this may have caused to you.
We will offer a fair compensation as soon as you receive the payments.

But the withdrawal has been completed yet. 
I think only police can move your site.

My withdrawal has been confirmed on 18th April. But I am still waiting for. 
I think I need to report to the police.
@_date: 2015-05-31 08:09:53
Yes, I will contact to both of them and use SNS aggressively. 
Sorry, I don't have contact to Rick. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 12:29:48
Thank you very much for your advice. 
I will try to report both. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 08:20:47
I ve got a response after 3 days of waiting as well. 
The message I received is same with you and same with last week. I will request them to provide exact date officially. If they cannot, I should commence an action at law.

I am considering to report to Singaporean police first. Then they can give me some advice about this. 
If I need to report to Australian police, I will do as well. 
I have filed transaction &amp; withdrawal history screenshots and email history already.
I have collected bank statement from the date I withdrew.

My case was worse than you. 
I requested the withdrawal on 16th April 2015, but I could receive the money on 14th July. 57K SGD has been stuck for 3 months. 
Their service is SUPER slow. I will not use them anymore.
