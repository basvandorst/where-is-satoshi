You could buy fractional shares in a beanie baby and have it held by someone else.
Bitcoin has big issues with that as well:

If all social security money went into investment markets, investment returns would necessarily go down (or we'd necessarily have inflation).  This guy is looking at it only as if he could invest his and everyone else wouldn't do the same.
Also it pays for disability, orphans, periods of unemployment (macro-economic factors can be outside of an individual's control; recessions don't happen because everyone gets lazy at the same time) and other stuff that he isn't considering, or is and considers theft but doesn't seem to consider things like collecting rent on unimproved land, backed by government force, theft.

I didn't say any of that.

Yeah, I thought you meant you bought the laptop with coins that were valued over market.
With that extra bit of information I don't see why you'd be happy paying high fees.  You'd still be better doing large transfers to cash so a fee applies to a bigger block, and then having lower fees for things like purchases.  Though two laptops probably are a big enough expense that the fees on the transaction aren't that big of a deal.

Sounds like you either bought stolen laptops or you are offering evidence that Bitcoin is bad for sellers.  Two sides to every transaction. Or 3, if you include the high fees paying to turn grid power into waste heat.

But a Rolex bought with 2010 Bitcoin is has lost over 100,000x its value in Bitcoin.

Minesweeper is NP-Complete, a (likely) harder class of problem than cryptographic hash stuff:

Plus the treasury offers things like Treasury Inflation Protected Securities to guard against inflation: 
Very few people hold significant amounts of raw cash long term.
Bitcoin can also change in the future to become inflationary.  The rules have changed in the past by broad consensus.

Also unfair because Gold has industrial and commercial uses other than currency/store of value.
