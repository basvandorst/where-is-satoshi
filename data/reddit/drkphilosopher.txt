You don't realize the magnitude of what future citadels are or could be...
Imagine floating cities above the earth. Safe havens for the elite that float across the world. 
Millions of people existing in these massive hubs. Dozens of them with different ideals and cultures. 
Not cheap.
Relates to an older conspiracy (2000's) from an accidental time traveler who visited after the great war. 
--&gt; Not saying any of that is true, just saying.
Fun to think about.

Given property taxes... One never truly escapes paying rent.
I prefer the mobility and freedom of renting. If an opportunity comes up, I can be packed and gone in a weekend. New neighbour's dog driving me nuts? Etc.
Something broke? Call the guy for free.
Change of scenery/accommodation or cost? Simple notice needed.
Investing in Real Estate is a fine vehicle. Preferably if you can wait for a downturn and buy at a discount or in a stable region. Commercial Real Estate is risky, moving forward.
Primary Residence real estate is, Imo, circumstantial and optional. Thinking the price of real estate must ever go upwards is speculation. The underlying factors must support the price (healthy buyers, credit, etc).
In the end... If you aren't passionate about real estate, want more freedom and mobility, don't buy real estate.
All land is finite... But not all land is in demand

Cause I'm still waiting to meet someone IRL who even knows what a bitcoin is without me having to explain it.
One day I hope someone will try to convert me to BTC...
Hell, I'll even sit down and hold their bags while they rant about some shitcoin just for the pleasure of the conversation.

Just ask 50 Cent...

Short Reply:
I find it both funny and disturbing that people, when discussing a breakthrough technology with little wider adoption, can so easily assume maximalism of any value or technology. 
If I went back in time... It would be like being a,'telephone line' maximalist. 
Obviously you need telephone lines, and will need them forever... Can't transmit waves through the air... �� 
Longer Answer:
Billions around the world don't share your sentiment though.
Take that list of items that makes bitcoin valuable and ask yourself how much value it holds to the billions around the world. Who cares? 
We do. 
Who doesn't care? 
Consumers. 
Who do we need more of? 
Consumers. 
Brand Name is nearly irrelevant to the masses. What difference does a BTC Token have when compared to a ETH Token to the masses, aside from price. If I wrote 10 random wallet addresses, how many people know the difference? 
The masses are not rational. 
Security is measured by the unwillingness of miners and prospective miners/hackers to attack the network. Consider the vulnerabilities in security. The entire fundamental behind this security is the idea that these people don't want to nuclear their own holdings or dominance. 
A competing chain(s) can provide that nuclear ammo given that the stakes are high and the rewards are higher. 
The speed of development is slow and pathetic. 10 years and BTC is stuck in a block size, multiple forks birthed that also take users and naming rights, everyone claims they are the true king. 
It's Game of Thrones for Crypto. 
Existing features... Like the promised smart contracts and other such additions? 
ETH never should have got off the ground if BTC Foundation was actually funded from the start and cohesive.
Consumers don't care about decentralization. They care about the benefits but hate the drawbacks. 
And they won't like transaction fees. 
What honestly makes me most bearish towards BTC and why I sold out years ago is simply this idea that BTC is King and that can't change. It's not logical when discussing breakthrough technologies. 
It is even less logical when one considers that other chains have innovated on the BTC idea while BTC lumber on with a side-chain to make up for its lack of adaptability and the complete dominance over the network by miners. 
That 'logic' will burn more than tokens. 
If one is speculating - BTC is primed for growth. 
If one is investing - BTC is outdated technology that moves too slow. 
Bitcoin is not the greatest token in the world anymore. 
It still could be! But it isn't.
Also.. Your logic fails to address socio-economic differences in various countries. What if China broke off a fork of BTC and utilizing their 'Social Credit System' enforced or encouraged the use of other chains. 
You don't need to ban something outright to limit its use. 
What if most people just want a free transaction secure currency that works every time?
BTC is lost entirely on this market during peak periods and when transaction fees paid are too low and the ledger item is held in purgatory.
Once adoption takes hold... As we are seeing now, BTC and ETH can't take the heat (See the ETH network disaster over that Kitty Collectable Game) 
Whereas a store of value...
Debatable. BTC either has to continually rise or flatline long term for this to be functional. Which makes inflation in the real world will still eat at one's savings.
Regardless... As is right now, I would need multiple currencies to live anyway. BTC to store my 'value' and another to use on the daily.
Since most people don't have wealth, seems the adoption will favor the secondary daily currency.

After some consideration I think I'm going to risk all the karma and write a detailed and cited post for my arguments.
There was a comment in reply before yours which addressed my comment directly and provided the dots I needed to help others see the connection I see.
That comment was deleted soon after, which means he either realized the connection or... I dunno. He obviously spent a lot of time and gave it some thought.
Regardless... Parroting the Narrative of BTC Maximalism at me isn't going to help either of us.
Thanks for your reply regardless. I'll post the thread here once it's up... Might end up buried under FUD karma or Mod deleted but shall see.
Work is hectic suddenly so I'm aiming for something early next week or before.
Thanks again.
