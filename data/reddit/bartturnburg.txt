One last question: which other Crypto currency’s do you recommend to invest in, I’ve got a 2 thousand euro left after my investment in btc

I just discovered recently that al lot of people who invest in crypt-coins are active here on Reddit (i don’t know anyone in my circles who has any knowledge of any of this so i had to figure it out on my own) so i can’t comment on because I’m using Reddit to short to comment.
But i think I’m gonna invest some, thank you for your information and time.
