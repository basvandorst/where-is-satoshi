More relaxed KYC still requires a phone number at minimum, which most government agencies can associate with people, if motivated and authorized to do so.

What's clear to *me* is the subjective aspect. *You* may think a hard fork is *needed* at this time. However, anyone holding such an opinion would be pretending that other, less drastic, solutions are not available.

No, first a hard fork by miners supporting BU would threaten to change Bitcoin forever by giving themselves more power than they had with Bitcoin up to now. Then, in response Core could change the PoW to prevent the widely discussed pre-planned attack by the BU miners on the original chain by mining empty blocks. 


Again, the temporary instability and consequent loss of money would be initiated, "caused" by the fork to BU. 


The longest of two chains using the *same consensus rule* would be regarded as the valid chain. Litecoin has a chain with more than twice the blocks of Bitcoin, but it uses a *different* consensus rule, that's what makes it "not Bitcoin". BU proposes to *change* the consensus rule of Bitcoin to something new (EC). According to the rule we've been using all along the BU branch of the fork would be an "invalid" chain and not control "Bitcoin", no matter how much hash power was behind it. 


This is precisely what BU is attempting.


The core devs *are* working on top layer or second layer products for Bitcoin. Sending BTC to the Moon is the mission they are on. How is having all core devs working for Blockstream necessary or even desirable? 
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:40:01
Yes. 
BU is a step towards centralization. Centralization is a threat to security. We can't compromise on security without compromising security. BU must be and will be rejected and resisted.
Oh fuck, now *I'm* spouting slogans.  
sorry.

The statement clearly says:
"We may, after careful analysis over a sustained period of time, individually or collectively determine that a hard fork proposal is not contentious."
The paper also details a 7 point criteria to establish a reasonably provable industry-wide consensus.
*That's* how.

Unlimited blocksize was an attack vector which had to be fixed. Reverting to "the way it was" would reintroduce several other exploits in the original code.    


... and proven to have some problems, on the LIVE chain.

OK, for the non-technical user that don't want a whole lot of mumbo-jumbo... simply raising the blocksize limit to 2, 10MB, (or something dynamic) would be a step towards the Chinese government going Tienanmen Square on Bitcoin.

Yes, but further centralization = lower security. If you'd like to learn more about how larger blocks contribute to centralization [this wiki page]( is written in simple terms for those allergic to technical mumbo-jumbo.  


Correct, Moore's law does not mitigate those issues with centralization. Segwit can't make electricity cheaper outside of China, or create ASIC chip foundries outside of China, but it does offer solutions without amplifying such advantages, which do contribute to centralization.
Edit: To say nothing about the hazards of a contentious hard fork required to implement a block size increase. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:49:48
On the basis of your justification, would it be right for Core to develop a new PoW and distribute it to selected miners in case of a hard fork?
@_date: 2017-03-30 12:31:37
Moore's law is but one consideration among several other technical  mumbo-jumbo components of the problem which the non-technical user won't understand. My reply was dumbed down to the bottom line for that reason.   
If you'd like to talk about it, what has Moore's law done to avoid or reduce the centralization of mining and the production of mining equipment in China?

I don't think that's what Satoshi said.
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:17:51
I'm very confident that even if Core did put together a reliable 2X hard fork proposal, and set a flag day before the NYA 2X takes place, what would happen is we'd split the chain, and then the NYA would proceed anyway and split the chain again. Then we'd have BCH, and BTC, and BTC2xCore, and BTC2XNYA.
That's the objective of nefarious actors and their useful idiots: Fragment the community with hard forks.
 
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:06:12


"It" being a hardfork to increase the blocksize by 1mb and nothing else? That's a pretty fucked up thing to do to every single member of the ecosystem for such a *technically* insignificant upgrade. That's what's bad about it. That you don't or can't appreciate that suggests a variety of issues with your cognitive abilities. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:48:19


You've almost got it. But there is only one Bitcoin. BCH and 2X are altcoins. Just as Namecoin is another, older, fork of Bitcoin yet it's not a "version of Bitcoin".
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:14:11


Well, if you expect that the average bitcoin user, with minimal technical comprehension needs to react and change/update the software they run in order to mitigate potential negative consequences, then the source and nature of the change should be regarded as an attack. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:47:02
In the case of a hardfork like 2X, do you think it's node, hashrate, developer or user majority that has the potential to "wipeout" the other chain single-handedly if it gets longer, the way UASF did?

There are 2 groups of people who understand how segwit have activated without segwit2x:

2: the miners who blinked when the # of UASF nodes grew on every day of each week for a month. 
You are a member of neither, so I don't expect you to understand.

@_date: 2017-08-17 19:12:45
Well then you must be pretty new around here because for the last 2 years the argument has been between doing a hardfork (big blocks now) OR softfork (optimizations first). The softforkers, who favor SW over big blocks have argued, intelligently, clearly and CONSISTENTLY that contentious hardforks will split the chains which can have very negative consequences. Softforks are safer and preferable for that reason.  Now that we have secured a safe SF as the next step in scaling we have less reason than ever to do a contentious HF.

I'd like to tamp down the interpretation of these forks as producing multiple versions of "Bitcoin". It only helps to confuse people, which I believe is the whole point of these forks, especially the ones with 'bitcoin" in the name. There is Bitcoin and then there are altcoins, even if the blockchains of these altcoins at one time had a common history with the Bitcoin blockchain.

Bitcoin talk forum: Total Voters: 78 of 125 (62.4%) support 2x
 (twitter followers): 1,314 votes (66%) support 2x
Some bitcoin blog in germany: 144 of 560  (26%) support 2x
and hilariously:
an unrelated poll on *bitcoin.com* asking if "I believe that Block size limit should be increased to 8 mb as soon as possible" where 67,858.41805561 BTC agree through some signing mechanism I suppose... what's that 0.001% of the 16 million bitcoins out there?

BTM operators working in the open need to have AML/KYC policies to get a business bank account, as well as avoid entanglements with authorities. Keeping daily limits low is how that works. The limits are aimed at impulsive buys for market opportunities and DCA strategists, or to get a few bucks for your night out.  
@_date: 2018-04-11 12:18:26
No, we do not need ID. If we permitted transactions over $10,000 per day we would be required to collect ID but at 3K per day we are well below that threshold. 
I don't know if the government could trace an individual from a phone number, but I would presume they could. Online exchanges usually require you to provide 2 forms of ID as well as a copy of a utility bill. Beyond being a honey pot to hackers such details will leave no doubt about your exchange activities. 
 
@_date: 2018-04-10 19:20:40
7% may seem high but the average BTM fee is 8.54%, the average **buy** fee is 9.04%, I'll always beat the average fee or go out of business trying.  
Why so high? Well, BTM owners/operators use exchanges themselves (but spare you the risk of putting your balance on the exchange), so we pay the exchange fees and assume the usual risk. We also need to maintain liquidity at the exchange to provide the service, moneys which could be invested elsewhere or at least earning interest. Then, with many manufacturers they collect a percentage of profit as a residual for hardware and software support. We also have banking fees for deposits and moving funds to the exchange. We typically pay the host venue some percentage where the BTM is located, for footprint, data and electricity. There's costs to launching a business, licensing, logo, websites, and so on. Smart operators have insurance. If the operation requires assistants they need to get paid. With all this it's not unreasonable for the people building physical on and off ramps to want to make a profit, it's considerable time, trouble and risk. And it's sustained risk, these machines take time to pay for themselves. Did I mention the cost of buying such things? I'll let you browse:    
In the end I do this to help the world integrate bitcoin in everyday life. I charge below average fees because I want to be a good ambassador, there's no competition from other BTMs in the cities where mine are located. I spend oodles of time with newbies and I like doing that, but I need to make a living.   
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:42:12
I totally understand. 7% is a premium for the convenience of on-the-spot conversion to and from cash, pedestrian access, and it's also a little more incog than uploading a bunch of identity docs to an online exchange (we still require a phone number to send you a PIN number).
     
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:21:07


Some people simply cannot meet the ID requirements at online exchanges. They may not have bank accounts to transfer funds from, or have photo ID(s), or be able to provide recent utility bills to confirm where they live. Some people are just uncomfortable using online exchanges, or meeting strangers to exchange cash. Please don't call folks "stupid, dumb or retards" just because they live with circumstances or concerns which are different from yours.

The fees are about convenience. The price of bitcoins can (and often does) fluctuate by 5% or more per day. If it takes a week or two to get registered on an exchange, or for the legacy system to process your bank wire and fund your account the opportunity cost can be far more than 7%.
