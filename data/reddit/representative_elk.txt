Sometimes I forget I'm on Reddit ��

I don't like this meme for the fact that it doesn't facilitate discussion. Somebody isn't wrong for thinking like Trump and his stance isn't unprecedented. I say lets facilitate discussion around these things, and not turn this into the same polarized paradigm we see in left vs. right politics.

You're still thinking too small. Imagine when Segwit 69 comes into play!

I might actually be dumb because I don't understand your point.

Wouldn't it be remain since 7% is plural?

Here is my best ELI5 version:
So the first thing I'll say is that it's not a disputed fact that ETH is not as secure as Bitcoin. ETH is turing complete, meaning every bit of code written is enabled. BTC is not turing complete, and they locked it down to its most basic functionality. More code == more bugs. This is also why ETH is better for smart contracts, because it has more functionality and therefore better code for doing things like smart contracts.

This is interesting because I feel exactly the same way. In a sense I kind of hope it's a "no news is good news" kind of thing, but I'm going to have to look this up now.

My Bitcoin fell while I was sleeping

Are you purposefully being dense? Google Forex trading.

Well the good news is the price can only go up from there!

So do you keep your life savings (or would you, I'm guessing you don't have any money) in the stock market? Or do you keep it in a bank account?

I'm still hodling from 15k so yeah. I'm an idiot.

At least consider a less scummy place. I'm not sure how controversial Gemini is but it's what I use and I have generally read good things about it.

I like the spirit of this, but you're not helping if you aren't being explicit. This is very cryptic and noobs are going to have no idea what you're talking about.
@_date: 2019-05-21 17:28:34
Fair point.

I was talking about Coinbase.

If we were talking stocks I would agree, but we aren't. I took a screenshot when Bitcoin and alts were all skyrocketing, and literally every altcoin in my screenshot has died since then. For me it's 100% Bitcoin. It's money I can afford to lose anyways.
