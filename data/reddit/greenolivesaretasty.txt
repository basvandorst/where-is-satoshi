I signed up on 3 December 2017 and the feature has not yet been re-enabled. 
I believe their verifications are closed because their platform got overwhelmed. Check out their Twitter for some narrative to this, including news of their imminent new trading engine.
Support told me this when I reported the issue:
Thank you for getting in touch with us and reporting this.
We are aware of issues that are resulting in difficulties for users who are trying to get verified and are seeing a 'feature unavailable' or 'feature disabled' error message.
These are technical issues from our end and not a problem with your account.
Our developers have been notified of this incident and are working to troubleshoot and fix it as soon as possible.
When our developers are finally done, you will be able to get verified.
Sorry for any inconvenience caused by this and thank you for your patience and understanding while we are working to resolve these issues.

Correct. I assume it will be back when their new platform launches
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:41:55
They're having a major system upgrade and I don't know any more than they have already said publicly on this. See:

It works with USB OTG. It's compatible with Mycelium (caveat: Mycelium doesn't yet support segwit)

BitPay is not known for being BTC-friendly so it's hardly a vessel for your suggested use case

Trezor and Ledger (hardware wallets which works with smartphones) have a screen so you can confirm the address on your device is the correct address and has not been changed by malware. Does this have a screen?

Send and receive BTC functionality is limited to obscure methods. I did not express an opinion on whether people should/shouldn't sell BTC for fiat
@_date: 2018-05-31 18:15:53
Mixed feelings. I see what you did there and think it is quite clever.
It would be good for a Bitcoin/crypto trading market subreddit... I think this subreddit is more about the technology, news and memes rather than trading. In the same way that there's no Bitcoin ticker here. 
Introducing this wouldn't be the end of the world though
@_date: 2014-11-25 23:16:56
great trolling!

This is a misquote of Jihan's tweet... he refers to Bitcoin Cash, not Bcash. IMO this nuance could change how what he said is perceived

maybe tell them in The Donald subreddit to write a receiving address? and link them to something that shows them how to create a wallet etc?

More people will join the other side if their message is clearer than ours. Agreed that I should be spreading the message, but I worry I can't compete with BCH's marketing budget

What if they fix the centralisation problem? It's then our scaling solution vs theirs. That's my thinking of why I framed this how I did
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:18:18
I think we should celebrate both! 
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:02:33
Agreed. Pretty accurate. Thankfully what I lost in MtGox wasn't life changing, though for many it was (or has become, due to deflation)

I guess page 2 on Forbes is a good place to store my private key.
Just a heads-up that Forbes' web design makes it not obvious that the article continues!
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:24:46
It's probably not worth the potential SEO benefits if this implies it's even possible to have an "official" bitcoin website

Unless it's Mark Karpeles! ;)

I don't know (am I allowed to say that?) We're in the middle of the upwards channel I spoke about though. Still looking bullish.

What currency pair, exchange and time frame is that please?

Many are confused by behaviour on Twitter because his message seems inconsistent, but this seems disconnected thus far with the good job he is doing with [bitcoin.org]( \- one of the oldest, most established and well maintained A-Z of Bitcoin. Because of what he does on Twitter, I believe there is an underlying fear that his Twitter attitude will make its way to his website.
In addition, there's more to Bitcoin than just Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Core ([ is a great node to run but don't conflate the node with the network, community, apps surrounding it, etc. This website doesn't have the same purpose as [bitcoin.org](
@_date: 2018-02-25 11:03:01
Yes. Park them in your own wallet!
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:15:59
IMO news implying some Bitcoin mining in China was done with support of the state was featured on the front page of this sub, this caused a spike upwards, the market then tested a major diagnal downwards resistance line for the first time in days. On the second attempt it broke though for about 15 minutes showing that people were not selling, then massive bull spike. We now find ourselves rejoining an upwards channel that was established a few days ago.
@_date: 2017-09-24 14:02:35
Good. I've always wanted to pay in ships.
@_date: 2017-09-22 16:23:01
Today, London banned Uber, and taxi drivers licenced by the state rejoiced. Anyone see any ironic parallels?
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:31:44
It's more speculative at the moment, but as time progresses, I believe it will prove how it is superior to the dollar including for purchases
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:27:00
For cheap outgoing SEPA transactions, investigate  .
However, from what I've seen, usually,  has the highest volume in GBP/BTC. Read about how to fund a Coinfloor account here: 
Also, this price comparison always helps me see the bigger picture

Thank you, this detail is important in my opinion. I took the post at face value like many others will as I had not clicked through

How does this dismantle Ver's position? This is getting far more abstract than I believe you need to get to address Ver's claim that BCH is Bitcoin. 
I'm guessing that Ver would respond that BCH is the one global chain and that BTC is the one that veered away from the whitepaper. 
Also, in my opinion, the same criticism you have for Ver can be applied to your analysis too. You have referred to Satoshi as an authority, and Satoshi is inaccessible and interpretation of the intent behind his writings are purely subjective etc.

Hey, how come I only got 4 hours to redeem mine, not fair!
I've never been a btc-e customer. This was sent to the email I signed up with for MtGox. Don't think I used the same email for any other exchange etc. As you know, this db leaked.

I came looking to upvote a comment like this. You didn't disappoint :)

I disagree. Look at some other charts for comparison like gold

You cannot transfer Bitcoin to your bank account, only Dollars from Bitcoin you have sold, therefore your question is confused. I believe you asked the bank the wrong question if you worded it like you are wording it above.
A better question would be: Will I have any issues if I make a withdrawal from Coinbase to my bank account? 
This is specific to the bank you use or country you are in. Probably not, but some banks are anti-Bitcoin and will give notice that they are closing your account because you are, for whatever arbitrary reason, considered high risk. 
I recommend you do a Google search for Bitcoin and your bank because you won't be the first at your bank to try. If you find evidence that people had their account closed following a transfer/withdrawal to a Bitcoin exchange, then yes, expect problems and open a bank account elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-05-20 14:43:14
Or that you have an HD wallet? :)
@_date: 2017-05-14 12:01:39
From my understanding, miners (not "people" or "users" in a general sense) reach consensus in BU depending on the options they use when mining, such as their block size preference. Critics say miners will abuse this, leading to centralisation by using a much larger block size.
Separately, you lost me when you said not running BU is still BU.

USD. Coinbase is an exchange where you can exchange BTC for USD and vice versa.
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:09:38
Consider something like selling them in Kraken for EUR and use Revolut via Sepa for the transfer and conversion to GBP

@_date: 2017-05-27 23:08:59
I will support UASF but not for this reason. It is inadvertent that UASF stops ASICBOOST and alternative solutions exist that do not involve UASF, so you are conflating things. 
In addition, after reading other comments, I think people seem confused... It is not any Segwit that stops ASICBOOST, it is only soft-fork Segwit that, again, inadvertently, stops ASICBOOST.
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:49:37
This communication by Coinbase is very poorly written and has triggered unnecessary panic
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:29:31
No, no one knows what will happen. If you want a safe investment, go for something more traditional that is tried and tested, though note that low level risk would mean a low level return.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:07:58
You are right
@_date: 2017-05-11 16:16:21
"central bank of the internet"? I understand how they need to liken it to something that people in the room understand, but surely this analogy is just wrong
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:48:23
No, not an appropriate analogy. I assume you are trying to refer to chain splits/hard forks.
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:47:03
I doubt it. While the Core vs Unlimited disharmony has no doubt held us back, there has been no new significant set backs within this time frame to correlate 
@_date: 2017-07-14 12:07:46
childcarecenter.us are going to wonder where all this traffic is coming from lol
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:52:11
I worry that it is undermining the case for UASF if it is pitched as the solution to stop ASICBOOST as the argument seems disingenuous, otherwise I would not be so pedantic. Who is "us" and "we" anyway?
@_date: 2017-05-12 11:04:16
That's a relief, thank you. You're right, I only saw the one slide
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:20:47
That's a lot of words you just put into my mouth. Where did I say any of that!? IMO a split will cause problems, but I didn't think your analogy explained what was going on. You asked if it sounded familiar, and to me it doesn't
@_date: 2017-06-06 10:13:33
While looking into this, I came across a discussion on their issue tracker
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:45:10


Not worth it anymore. This will cost significantly more in electricity than the Bitcoins it produces. Nowadays, people use ASICs for mining
@_date: 2017-06-05 00:33:38
Surely the cost of mining Bitcoins with a PC will be greater than the cost of buying the same amount of Bitcoins from a market place?
