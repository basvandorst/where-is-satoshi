I wouldn't of believed it if I hadn't had to wait 861 minutes to transfer between exchanges even after a 720 sat/byte fee.. Bitcoin is broken and it's by greed.

cryptos aren't for you then. no one would consider this to be safe. there is nothing stopping the govt's of the world making it illegal to convert back to fiat tomorrow, then what are you going to do ?
if you want a safe investment, choose govt bonds.  if you want a the return of the stock market average with low fees choose a vanguard ETF.  i doubt you would find anyone advising you to gamble it all on cryptos.

if you can be physically present when theres a mini crash and press the buy button quicker than the bots... good luck.

can't you exchange it for cash at the same exchange you exchanged cash for bitcoin ?

sign up to nicehash.
go buy 6 gtx1080's
mine altcoins
get paid in bitcoins
unless they get hacked again.

everyone is an expert in hindsight. i signed up for a bitcoin exchange in 2014 and didn't pursue it until this year. with the 10k ive invested i would never have to work again if i held true to my gut at the time. you made the right decision based upon the info you had at the time, you're doing better than a lot of penny stock speculators out there which is the equivalent of people that have been hodling since before 2016.

Pack it up boys. It was nice while it lasted.

no doubt they face the same overall issue however much further down the track.  however they don't seem to be stuck with the false inertia that now plagues bitcoin core. i hope like everyone bitcoin gets its shit together. 8 years now to come up with a solution and there is no shortage of good ideas, just a will to do it.
it reminds me of when bill gates said 640kb was more memory than you will ever need.

Litecoin, ripple, bcash, whatever, they're all actually useful today.  Don't let dogma get in the way of reality.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:42:03
wonder how many true believers at r/bcash are starting to waiver..
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:55:17
do you future kids a favour and give them a comfortable life. start now, don't wait.  bitcoin or otherwise, get your money out there to work for you. you'll regret not doing it in 20 years time.

Why will they come down? As the price of Bitcoin inevitably rises the fees rise in tandem.  Be patient.. be real more like it, Bitcoin is fundamentally flawed at the moment, it will never replace anything of the transfers between exchanges completely bottlenecks the network let alone a replacement for the current system of commercial transactions.
8 years to come up with something to make it viable and the big players knowingly sit in the hands.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:52:44
I have moved a majority to alt coins, it took the recent events including the mad rush to exit back to fiat to highlight the need to do so. 2025 when lightning comes around, core believers will wonder why Bitcoin isn't number 1.
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:49:06
and they will be overruled by those until its no longer advantageous to do so.  they're not in it to save the world or ideology, they're in it to make money.  i expect a hard fork by the 'no true scotsman' core developers to create a bitcoin-the_real_satoshi_vision in the future, along with the same bullshit as with bch and btc.

I just tried to send my life savings of $6.73 in Bitcoin to my grandmother who is suffering with cancer to pay for her chemo and I got hit with $82 in fees now I can't afford to feed my family of 7. Wtf Bitcoin you were supposed to make me rich!
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:28:22
We're way past the bear trap stage.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:44:38
The fees weren't always high, they've been engineered through stonewalling easy fixes, over last year to increase exponentially for no reason other than greed.  I've got no sympathy for Bitcoin falling away in popularity compared to what were previously shitcoins.  The fact I paid a reasonable fee the other night and had to wait 14 hours for my transaction to be confirmed all but sealed the deal for me.
And here I was thinking were the greedy ones.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:05:31
i agree with you. so much for bitcoin being decentralised. decentralised geographically, centralised by large corporations who can afford a crazy ASIC farm strategically positioned where power is cheap in the world.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:26:13
possibly the same divergence of the korean exchanges vs everyone else.  access to exchanges for people with money may be an issue, especially today with this crazy spike in price.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:48:10
Block size? Stupid fees? The control vested in the few? Shit on bcash all you want, its actually usable.
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:44:27
bitcoin is the ultimate in free market expression.  there is no regulation involved in it or its competitors as you already know.  if its competitors can do the same as bitcoin but better, quicker, cheaper, more efficient, there's nothing to stop the churn over to that competitor.  
i had complete faith in bitcoin until this latest debacle and the community consensus is hamstrung but ultra rich mega ASIC mining farm owners that pick and choose which part they want to implement for their own reasons.  that alone would mean that bitcoin is in effect now the plaything of those miners and decentralised by geography only.. big deal, they control the lot.
all i'm saying is, the miners knew what would happen.  the dev community knew what would happen for years now.  now that absolute disaster of 300000 unconfirmed transactions and the price skyrocketing happened, the knee jerk reaction to all of a sudden hurry up and implement segwit has seen the bleed off to alt coins which now shows the btc dominance fall to low 40%'s.

welfare was rorted through fake child care government subsidies in australia and directly funnelled to isis. 
hsbc launded money for south american gangs
the cia funded its own covert ops through the sale of cocaine.
if funding/supporting terrorists is the metric by which a government says enough is enough, they'd better look in their own backyard first.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:49:17
It had quite a bit to do with those gaming the system through inaction and overall control of the fees.

your right, it doesn't owe you anything, the world doesn't owe you anything.  and you don't owe anything to bitcoin either.  myspace was the biggest and first social media company as well.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:51:45
you're not creating the fiat money. the value of bitcoin is only what people are willing to pay in fiat at the end of the day.  one day when the bitcoin price point is actually found and it stabilises, bitcoin will be a constant and fiat currencies will revolve around it.
