I remember a couple years ago when they said this.

Censorship means one entity stops another from speaking. Censorship can be done by anyone, not just a government. Additionally, the concept of "free speech" or "free expression" can be separated from your "constitutional right not to be silenced by the government" which is guaranteed by the First Amendment. 
The concept of tolerance is a fundamental liberal Enlightenment value that does not cease to exist beyond the realm of state action.  I like a lot of XKCD comics but Randall is 100% wrong on this point. Embracing censorship simply because the perpetrator is not the state is anathema to a free society.

I don't disagree with everything, but this paragraph doesn't seem logical. 


If you expect a currency to appreciate in value, creditors benefit from the appreciation. So if banks did recognize the long term benefits of cryptocurrencies, they'd try to make all loans in cryptocurrencies. If people paid back the loans with interest, their profits would be loan interest rates + appreciation rate of the currency. They would benefit by owning the cryptocurrency just like everyone else that owns it.
