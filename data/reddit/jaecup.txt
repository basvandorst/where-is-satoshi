well ok 500000, but yea that's just a typical night of strip club money.

lol well if they are averaging in the 300's a day that would be about 10k a month...so I'm not sure what a daily record has to do with it.

Referring to your project as perfect is tooting your own horn and asking to be called out just as much as calling your product the most important product. Maybe something like the perfect money for the digital age or the digital currency for the digital age. Otherwise it sounds like a scam. To me at least.

The bitcoin price has been in a state of decline but can you honestly say the ecosystem has?

I'm going to assume he means 21btc...could be wrong here but If I hold 21 bitcoin( which I don't ) and the price rises 10000% that would be make me about a millionaire....can you just not math or maybe you're just already that wealthy. There's two main types of people in this sub. That guy who wont shut the fuck up about some new thing he's interested in and that ass hole who feels the need to shit on everyone to make themselves feel better. Both are represented here anyway.

Thanks for the feedback way more than I expected. I'll throw a few LTC at that address if it's still useable. Being a developer it's definitely not a task I'd take on for $500! But awesome job nonetheless.

Honest question how much did they raise / did it cost? It's a good looking site. No way someone did it for less than 1k though right?

If they are steadily avg 300 a day, disregarding what anyone says about manipulation, that seems to be a steady progress where as if you saw 5k one day and 50 all the others that seems more weird and fishy.

Yeah I'm not sure I haven't studied it enough to know what the type of savings actually come out to if at all...but I do try and spread out what I want to spend and would definitely say I'm up further than if I had just gone all in...though from OP picture the 11% gain seems pretty significant.

It pretty much highlights Bitcoins main problem...the lack of usability. They really need some core UX developers to create some standards and at least make it appear to not be living in 1995.

You likely know more about the situation than me, so maybe it hasn't moved a whole lot but if it is moving up and it's avg is 300s a day that seems about right is all I'm saying. And I agree I don't think 10k is that much either.

Now with the added $10 shipping Trezor has actually become more expensive lmao.

At least give some anecdotal evidence all I can gather you're saying is bitcoin price is down and my opinion is. Not to be an ass but in all seriousness because this sub just loves touting BS whether it's positive or negative. Also because I understand the price could be seen as being in decline over the past 24 months but even if the profitability of bitcoin services isn't skyrocketing the infrastructure and ecosystem are way more developed...from wallets to exchanges etc. I think Bitcoin is way far from being an easily usable technology but to say the ecosystem is in decline seems pretty far off.
Also briefly browsing that blog it says a lot of good things but the problems it addresses have been there since Bitcoin began. The ecosystem wasn't at peak when BTC cost $1200. Mt Grox wasn't a signifier of a decaying ecosystem it was signifier of a technology with a lot of problems, which I do agree haven't been fixed and still exist. So maybe it's better to say you shouldn't put full trust into the system because the progress of fixing it's issues have actually waned behind the progress of the ecosystem and that could set it up for a more epic failure.

my understanding is that by making many small buys at shorter intervals you can somewhat offset the fluctuation in price. So if  you buy .5 btc right now that would cost you like 145 but if you had done that over the month it might have cost you 130-135 due to the price fluctuation.

I definitely plan on going back to Barbados whether they do or don't accept bitcoin. It's an awesome place. Make sure to hit the fish fry up on the weekends with the locals.
