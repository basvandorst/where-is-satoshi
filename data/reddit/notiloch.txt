The difference would then be that keeping a currency market stable benefits everyone, as opposed to a single company which has singlehandedly fucked millions of people.

Look how fucking wasteful these people are. So pathetic.

Giga Hash would be my guess - but I like Government Hash better. Or Gubernatorial Hash.

This is something I can't concern myself with. When I'm programming, I never ask myself "What if the computer interprets X as greater than Y when really Y is greater than X?" You just can't expect that to be a reality - and you surely shouldn't worry about it. The odds of making money from Bitcoin are much higher than an incredible breakthough in decryption techniques in the near future - at least as far as I can tell, so I'd be willing to bet my money on the current system.

It's anonymous in the sense that your identity isn't shown. How you choose to mask it further is up to you. Why not just distribute funds amongst multiple addresses? Now you can buy all the dirty stuff on one address.

$700 - so yeah, and given the way Adobe is trying to sell Photoshop these days I can't say we're that far off.

Well their Creative Cloud platform is a bit of a joke - and given their recent security breach they're not necessarily selling themselves as the "secure &amp; reliable" choice. I seriously implore you to try to find and purchase Photoshop CS6 on their website - took me probably 10 minutes to find it before I posted my response. They're seriously trying to kill Creative Suite in favour of their Creative Cloud solution - a model which is hated by many. If they keep shoving CC down our throats and continue to cut support for CS then they can expect a steady decline in business, and folks will be looking for alternatives. If enough people come with money to alternatives like GIMP, perhaps they will be able to reach parity with Photoshop.

Love the generosity in this subreddit!
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:22:10
Yeah because there aren't ads like that already!

No problem!

P2P is incredibly slow for widespread networking and isn't anonymous at all. Switching to decentralized networks would be pretty much the worst idea ever. Everyone would have an opportunity to eavesdrop on your conversations, government included and data could not be trusted because no trust can be established with any entity on an open network.
Google got caught in the middle because they weren't encrypting their intranet. For you and I, encrypting our intranet would be the equivalent of encrypting the connection between your laptop and your router. It's just paranoia, which unfortunately proved to be true.

You just need to remember that Bitcoin is still in its infancy. It will become more popular than it is now, just hold on to it.

*..What?* Google wasn't using the data in shady ways, did you read the article? The government is taking the information from Google illegally without Google's knowledge. Blame the government, not Google. It's ignorance like this that keeps the NSA out of the public eye. It's easy to blame huge corporations for this when you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about - clearly someone convinced you without providing you with very much information either.

Earlier this month or late September there was a security breach which, according to Adobe, affects somewhere in the range of 3,000,000 registered Adobe users. Last I heard the attackers had access to all credit cards stored by Adobe (encrypted mind you) and they were unsure whether the private keys for encrypting that data were accessed.  I don't have a link but it should be fairly easy to find with a quick search.
I believe that's the one, yes. It's subscription based SaaS.
I don't think it's wise to imply any of those things, my statement is merely speculation. But it's my opinion that people would look for alternatives if they become unsatisfied with Photoshop, and GIMP would be a good place to start. They take to the forums, "GIMP doesn't have feature X or it sucks", "We don't have the money/time to make that feature work for GIMP", "Where can I donate a heap of cash to get this ball rolling?"
Over dramatized/simplified, but you never know.

Fair enough! I think OP is crazy :)
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:17:20
I'm not necessarily advocating for Google, but they have a pre-existing "legal" agreement with the NSA to hand over information regarding blacklisted search terms (a list which is becoming exceedingly generic, mind you). This APPEARS to extend beyond that agreement, which I can believe. Google doesn't want to lose the trust of it's customers, I doubt they'd knowingly allow such actions to take place - especially when they're only excuse can be "we didn't know!"
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:17:41
You certainly are :) but that's ok these days I think

Damn it, OP is a throwaway. The fastest way to crack this would probably be to use logical guessing - perhaps the passcode reflects something of OP's interest.

These aren't the only characters you can use. It's UTF-8 so there's like what.. over 60,000 characters you can use?

This makes me so mad OP. Good for you for taking the time to learn about the alternate currency. I would love so very much to give your teacher an earful. Get your parents involved, I'm sure they will. Classic school system stifling intelligence and non-conformity. I don't understand this teacher.

All major search engines comply with requests for blacklisted search queries. Please refer to the "NSA blacklisted words" for more information on what the NSA is looking for.
