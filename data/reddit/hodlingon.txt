It should look the same against other stable currencies in the FX markets right (i.e. against USD)? The people of Argentina have a $10k/month conversion limit placed on them by their own govt, it's so fucked up!  They aren't allowed to exchange their fiat shitcoin to other, more stable currencies during this collapse.  Big yikes.  
Does anyone have insight into how crypto transactions are being treated there currently?  Their best bet really is to buy Bitcoin, but I'm guessing only a small fraction of the mass population will have the know how.  The rest will truly and utterly get financially rekt due to the hyperinflation.  It's very sad.

Remember seeing this gif in the first half of 2017, and it spoke to me.  This one, in particular, was quite memorable.  Just seeing it pumped fomo into my veins.
