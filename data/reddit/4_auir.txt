Obviously the potential reward is high, but I'm curious what his risk metric is. (likely he doesn't have one and ignores the high probability that this could just as well go to $0 due to a blissful ignorance inherent to posters of this forum). 
@_date: 2014-05-22 15:52:50
i think people just like saying the buzz word goldbug
@_date: 2014-06-04 19:28:34
Yes, I said it could go to $0. That is possible. You are delusional if you think it can't.
As a disclaimer, I'm invested heavily and do not think it will go to $0.

lol frankenmint has spoken
now i'm confident, thanks buddy
@_date: 2014-05-09 15:28:12
I don't understand your thoughts here. Why wouldn't people buy now? 
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:28:21
Because your opinion determines whether its viable in the future.
@_date: 2014-05-29 21:10:00
No. A massive profit is more exciting to me than the tech itself. But obviously you can't have one without the other, so it's actually a win-win or lose-lose over the long term.
@_date: 2014-04-02 16:46:08
Resistance is futile on I feel your pain
@_date: 2014-05-20 16:35:00
Ok. Personally I'd prefer to get rich quick over night. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 15:19:56
There's nothing to fall for. The money doesn't exist.
@_date: 2014-05-22 21:36:31
Not bad, but definitely not at a 10 year old level. More like slightly above average adult.
@_date: 2014-05-22 15:57:03
what a lame gift. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 19:55:57
What's the source of this? It's so specific that it sounds BS. There are so many unpredictable variables, I can't see how one would come to this conclusion. I think you'd be crazy to take this as a fact.
@_date: 2014-04-10 21:07:20
I hope that clears it up.

Well no shit. Hindsight is always 20/20.
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:46:15
Opposite for me. I learned of bitcoin through reddit.
@_date: 2014-03-21 13:58:38
I heard about these sanctions this morning, but what's this have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-06-04 17:26:00
I wouldn't. Way too risky.
@_date: 2014-04-17 15:32:01
Being an early adopter for Bitcoin really is like navigating a mine field. Only the smart and lucky will come out on the other side.
@_date: 2014-05-29 21:03:18

You think dollars are obsolete in just a few years?! LOL
@_date: 2014-04-04 15:35:22
But not before giving many people an awful first impression of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-09 14:53:10
But something crazy could happen and drop the price. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 15:59:15
ok. this is just as likely as any other "trend" that one could conjure up
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:58:08
You realize your mistake, sell your coins, pay your rent, and learn from your mistake. Don't spend what you can't afford. And in the future all is well :D
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:58:54
But news alerts people not familiar with bitcoin, hence a google search
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:06:42
I see what you did there 
@_date: 2014-05-17 13:07:18
What an awful way to welcome people to bitcoin. People like you give the community a bad name. Just a straight up asshole
@_date: 2014-01-23 21:03:11

Now survey 1000 blue collars from Cleveland and see what they have to say. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 14:00:26
Given the recent news, I'd probably be very skeptical if I were a layman too.
@_date: 2014-04-17 15:27:22
Always buy at tree-fiddy
@_date: 2014-06-04 20:15:24
A healthy dose of skepticism would be greatly beneficial to this community. What you just recommended I do is a large part of the problem that bitcoin is intending to solve, ironically. ie swallowing information that is spoon fed to you because it pleases your personal interest.
Think for yourself and question sources and credentials. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 20:29:01
I agree and I think it further confuses the uninitiated. Wtf is a bit? I thought the new thing was bitcoin? Whats the difference?! Eh this is too convoluted - I'm sticking with my dollars.
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:03:07
This is obviously a fact. No poll necessary IMO
@_date: 2014-05-09 15:06:25
arbitrary trend lines. Even if they weren't, past trends indicate nothing for the future. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 21:25:35
How is it not relevant? 
@_date: 2014-05-20 16:36:03
That's just called greed and is independent of bitcoin
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:32:50
Smart business strategy
@_date: 2014-05-09 15:25:23
I've wondered the same thing.
@_date: 2014-05-14 20:51:12
Yeah I'm a pretty smart guy. I've got a STEM degree and am more technologically inclined than 49/50 people I know. But I'm relatively layman when it comes to the gritty details of this. I don't understand it very well and therefore cannot get excited. It needs an super basic ELI5 splash page somewhere. For that matter, the entire cryptocurrency family could use a concise ELI5 webpage. bitcoin.com for instance
Simple real life demonstration videos would go a long way
@_date: 2014-05-14 21:49:15
Doubt he's the first pipe cleaner to accept BTC
@_date: 2014-05-14 21:33:21
Looks great.
Here to hoping you don't follow NEO&amp;BEE footsteps
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:05:34
It'll look good when the price rises above 480

I was told there would be a Tesla

@_date: 2014-06-04 17:24:24
what're your credentials?
@_date: 2014-05-23 11:52:07
Not a good metric. You're assuming coinmap showed the same proportion of businesses accepting btc in each picture. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 16:21:26
Totally false. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 15:33:00

@_date: 2014-02-13 12:22:12
They sent me a threatening email banning me from selling any cryptocurrencies. You are one lucky SOB.
@_date: 2014-03-12 13:38:57
I have bought 3 or 4 things. The rest I use to buy stocks from havelock.
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:58:40
the party has just begun.
@_date: 2015-05-14 21:48:05
Contractors are a different story. I'm talking most of your hourly jobs.
There's no incentive to finish the project timely and with quality when there is no project. You're paid because you are a body that can put in hours. You can fill a spot on the factory floor or keep shop in retail or serve in the service industry. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:01:32
Neither do I as I'm not from Cleveland nor am I blue collar. Just pointing out that your sample is biased.

@_date: 2015-05-06 17:06:11
@_date: 2015-05-14 19:57:45
This can't work for most blue collar jobs. The old standard must remain for the majority of people.
@_date: 2014-05-09 15:16:07
You should try it, troll. Makes it easier to read.
@_date: 2015-01-03 13:40:34
Why then and why $600? 
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:15:22
Of course, but things happen inevitably and there needs to be a gold standard by which these unfortunate situations are measured. This is raising that standard and hopefully waking the rest of the industry in the process.
@_date: 2015-01-08 22:40:11
The interviewer is an idiot. Patrick should've corrected his first sentence where he refers to BTC as a company.
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:15:09
No. It wasn't inadvertent anyway.
@_date: 2014-05-29 21:01:09
Why not? Because you could lose everything you invest. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:40:25
You can if you do it right. Time will tell if the people choose to trust or distrust them.
@_date: 2015-01-08 22:35:37
Those were the same instructions I got when my mail order bride croaked.
@_date: 2015-01-26 14:57:42
21 BTC will still be equivalent to billions of dollars in today's buying power if dollar value is replaced with BTC value. ie you'll still own 1 millionth of all wealth
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:25:21
That's right. Thanks
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:18:41
I'm just curious if you paid taxes on those gains.
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:59:16
Surprising and impressive recovery. This turned out to be very good for Bitcoin. Hopefully the rest of the industry follows suit, as the bar of professionalism during a crash has been set.
@_date: 2015-01-08 22:47:34
This is quite possibly the dumbest fact that I've ever read. Your choice of unit is arbitrary, thus meaningless.
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:21:27
Excellent idea for an outreach
@_date: 2015-01-07 21:13:55
The point is it's very impractical if not impossible to operate entirely in BTC at this stage. Especially in developing countries.

If you are too poor to continually drop $100 then just sell it. Make account, buy $100, collect $125, sell, make account, buy $100, ...
I'm still not seeing what stops anyone from abusing it.
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:27:02
Noob question, but is the passphrase specific to the wallet? I'm not sure how this all works. For example, if breadwallet ceases to exist and I lose the app, are my coins gone? Or can I recover them some other way? Are we relying on Bread Wallet to stick around?
@_date: 2015-07-10 17:46:09
Gotcha. I'd have hoped for something like that anyway. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:07:12
Thanks, I'll read that.
@_date: 2015-07-09 17:51:10
I too can create sentences.

No. You're not winning.
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:01:06
Honest question. What says Bitcoin won't be replaced by something different? A good answer to this will change a smart investor's mind. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 22:51:06
It works even better if you wipe with a circular motion. Hope this helps.
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:58:31
So? They have the same opportunity to do so as men.

How do you buy bitcoin with cash? Not counting black markets or under the table sales, because that's no solution for the general public.
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:19:14
Yeah, the irony is strong. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:38:16
Seriously? BTC investors are seriously on dat amateur time. Believe in the technology and forget about the damn price. If you don't believe in the technology enough to hold, then you shouldn't have money in it in the first place.
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:03:07
Yeah, I saw that too. I'm skeptical though. 1000 person sample size? Sampled from where? 
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:30:32
Growing pains, ie new infrastructure. Your concerns will be addressed. They will reflect in the price. It's crashing because it has not addressed these fundamental design flaws. Until it has, it'll remain low. 
The core technology is an improvement over how we currently pay for things. Payment freedom, low transaction fees, less risk for merchants, transparency, &amp; neutrality.
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:08:50
Thats all dandy, but how many subways do you know that accept bitcoin. Hell, how many people really know what BTC even is? I think we have more pressing matters. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:14:23
How can you be anti-bitcoin? I don't understand that. Just trolling? You like to see things fail?
Unless you're a banker, I don't see how this could possibly be a bad thing for you.
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:49:34
Yeah, mine is in the 4th guest house - 3rd floor. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:51:08
Obviously really big seeing as the internet is at least as heavy as a blue whale.
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:30:00
That's the way to do it. But I'd make it a supplemental gift in that case. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:33:31
seems legit.
@_date: 2013-12-19 12:33:15
It's not being used as a currency because it's still in its infancy. The infrastructure is not in place yet. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:10:43
Just today?
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:13:25
Therefore, it'll be worth more than the entire global GDP in no time.
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:16:20
Oh god here we go again. Good news guys! The price is tumbling! 
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:05:21
This does not seem like money well spent right now. I'd rather see it go into marketing or polishing current protocols, or maybe hardware wallets, ATMs, &amp; merchant hardware.
The people who are spending BTC at this stage of the game are the same ones who are willing to replenish it themselves anyway. I just think there are bigger fish to fry this early
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:23:55

Mine heats the entire apartment, seriously. Not that that's why I have it, but it is a nice little perk. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:05:52
Then you surely understood the incredible risk you took and should able to accept the consequences. I'd recommend keeping emotions out of it and only thinking objectively.
That said, I think it'll rise again and am continuing to hold as well. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:44:12
Damn right. I knew you'd come around - they always do. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm headed to light this sum'bitch. (in a densely populated public place, you know, so more people can celebrate American exceptional-ism)
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:31:57
Posts like this make this a worthless sub fueled by speculation.
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:19:42
You didn't lose bitcoins, but you lost purchasing power in dollar land.
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:48:36
"my entire life savings"
Bitcoin has introduced many amateurs to the world of investments and they're getting trial by fire. 
One of the highest risk investments out there. Very easy to get into. No counseling, no limits. Biased speculative communities like this sub promise "to da moon" returns and the rookies like this guy drop their life savings.
I think the exchanges need to have disclaimer statements at point of purchase.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:58:55
This is the truth.
But unfortunately right now we're like the 300 Spartans. We really need to strengthen the arguments for bitcoin to grow public acceptance by increasing vendors, making it more secure, easier to use for Joe Schmoe (ATMs &amp; hardware wallets), etc. Then we'll have more ammunition against the big governments and private entities against it. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:58:15
That's not the whole point of a currency. That's a commodity. Bit pay does absolutely everything that pay pal does. 
That said, it will stabilize as it becomes adopted by more people. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:56:49
I'd think you would have more luck with Valve. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:27:17
I don't know how simple it would be, no. I don't work for Coinbase to be able to know what kind of resource allocation they have going on. But something tells me that because of the boom they have enough on their plate and must spend every labor hour and every dollar very wisely.
If it's a ten minute thing, then by all means go for it. I'll use the shit out of it. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:32:46
Jealous of what? I am invested quite heavily in BTC. This post is so horribly incorrect that it actually HURTS BTC. It makes us look like a bunch of uneducated 17 year olds fresh from 4chan. Financial professionals look at sensationalist bs like this and probably laugh because it indicates that the price truly is determined by pure speculation. If we want to be taken seriously, then stopping the delusions will help immensely. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:45:13
All I know is that cryptocurrency is too big of a technological advancement to be ignored in the long term. Whether it's bitcoin or something else, I don't know. 
I'm scared a private or government created currency will be forced down our throats.

@_date: 2013-12-19 00:11:55
No, it's just what we call a high risk investment.

The price will naturally be volatile until it gets near its full adoption. Bitpay is a service that gives you instantaneous trade value in the mean time 
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:16:27
Wait. they're not? How do you explain... 
China making stuff for us, Mexicans giving us taco bell, Canadians being nice to us, France giving us the statue of liberty, The middle east being appreciative of our help, jesus choosing America to build his churches, Santa claus dedicating his life to giving us presents

Haha. The downvotes aren't going to make this true you idiots. Why do I keep returning to this sub. It makes me angry.
