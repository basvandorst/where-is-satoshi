It is an action taken to obtain some of the value of the market for themselves. They are trying to take a part of the market by undercutting the transaction time, and catfishing people into buying something they think is something else.
Deceptive actions with little regards to integrity of another man or groups' project, with the intent to remove or take from them and their project. That is an attack.

The major point of the "attack" doesn't lie in the forks. Please do fork. Concensus determines truth.
Please don't use propaganda methods and reasonably acceptable trademark addresses to forward a confusing and misdirecting message to inexperienced users.
"Bitcoin Cash" as a name doesn't hurt a fly, although it is significantly unoriginal. Registering bitcoin.com and the  twitter! And denouncing the thing most easily associated with the address is like registering the .com address for a bank and claiming it went out of business, with the exception that with banks, the media knows whether or not it has truth to is.
Posting confusing headlines, with the intent to misdirect the uninformed. Hijacking channels that are not relevant to your own project. Claiming ownership to a name you don't have a trademark to!
Those things are qualifiable as an offense. An attack.
If PepsiCo were to register  and linked it to the Pepsi homepage, there would be a media outrage.
Preying on uninformed users is a low blow, which causes the BTC community to have a reasonable reaction of a strong disliking and lessened respect every time an avatar of these  projects acts like this. Be that BCC or BCH.

Due to the halving of the reward once every amount of time, the inflation that happens not only gets cancelled by the value growth, but actual deflation happens because demand is higher than the amount of btc that could possibly exist. Eventually, the halving turns the amount of bitcoins asymptotic to a maximum amount. No more (significant) bitcoins will be created past that point.
While technically, as coins are being added, we have some inflation, it's being compensated for entirely by the growth, and is a temporary effect. While dollars can be printed, due to the nature of bitcoin, at some point no more bitcoins can be made.

It would be a potential example of a "best case scenario." As a real EMP hurt évery bit of technology. PR just needs to reactivate what they have, an EMP victim would require complete rebuilding of all infra.

This will make It out to other people.
Do damage control and make sure nobody talks, or everyone they mention it to will want a piece. You may think your friends and family are reasonable, but when mortgage-sized. Amounts of money are on the line, people start behaving very different.
Make sure your parents get taken care of when they are old. Then use the REST for charitables in the family (including your dad). Make the money "disappear" to where it won't disappear from theft.

Of course, nobody loves pot holes.
Government expenditure includes infrastructure maintenance. This means that your tax dollars go either directly or indirectly into those annoying roadworks that keep the general public from getting to their destination in time, but also keep them from ruining their cars on roads.
Centralizing these costs through taxation actually lowers prices for everyone. Larger purchases (repair 20 roads, get one free) get discounts, while an individual order will incur more costs for "getting them out there" than they will for the actual road repair costs.
My thought process included your statement of "Much smaller government expenditure", which probably points towards government expenses like the orange president's golfing trips (and to a lesser extend, the chocolate ones' as well). But what do you think is going to be cut first? Fuel for air force one, or the re-paving of that school road?
The only way to fix where the money is going, is to get good, trustworthy and reliable people into office. An office which bullies really like to hold. Welcome to politics.

It is exactly proportionally worth the same as buying the same amount of fiat worth in mBtc.

Because you get interest when you loan people money, not when you borrow from them.
On the flipside though, having everyone owe everyone money, makes "more money exist" for the economy to run on. It's kind of a shoddy way to do so, and won't be able to be restarted if it ever grinds to a zero-halt, but as long as it runs, it's "better than not having it."

This is a philosophical point, more than a real one.
If you transferred all your money to yen, and the yen just started to rise in value like crazy. Did you make a profit?
You only make a profit when people who accept money, start accepting the different currency.

I believe that a volantaryist society is an admirable ideology, limited by ease of adoption and by the degree of which people will (ironically) voluntarily give up the comfort and stability of a "guaranteed" currency. With the dollar, euro and yen supported by the authority of their attached governments, it will only fail when they do. As long as the USA exists, the dollar won't unrealistically catastrophically crash, ideally. This has happened only when the situation was extensively dire (german reichsmarks), and has been averted many times by governments (sometimes undeservedly) funding banks to keep the monetary infrastructure of the populace upright.
Agorism would be awesome, but I believe it's only going to be possible once we've reached something close to a robot-fueled utopia. We're not there yet, and maybe we never will, but keeping those systems in mind will help us remain sane in the mind-boggling complexity of the systems that keep humanity functioning in these past few centuries.
Politicians are our hope in the current system. Changing systems is ambitious, and often requires violent revolutions. Maybe the orange president will cause one? Who knows? Anyway, I'm off to get some groceries, being sad they won't take my bitcoins yet.

You get the attention of shareholders, by creating a pool of people who are prepared to do X, which makes them money because of Y.
If there is a slew of people who will buy a Tesla with Bitcoin, but not with dollars, that's a reason for them to accept it.

The euros have no value to the gas station, since they cannot be used with any other stores. It's a catch-22.

If you buy now, you will get the rate of now. If you sell now, you'll get the rate of now. Now being the moment you lock in your trade. This diversion between NOW and NOW allows for the game of "buy low sell high."
