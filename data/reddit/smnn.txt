Most likely OP is behind a carrier grade NAT preventing directly forwarding traffic.

I've had that problem as well after switching internet providers. For me the problem was that it wasn't a "real" IPv6 implementation. What a lot of providers do is they give you an IPv6 address and then route all your outcoming and incoming traffic over their own carrier grade NAT. Basically, a lot of users share only a few IPv4 adresses and the provider routes everything to their end users. That's the reason why port forwarding doesn't work anymore.
The way that I solved the problem was to ask my provider to switch me back to IPv4 with my own IPv4 adress. Sadly there is very few providers that have a real IPv6 implementation.

So I guess you are saying that it's still a good time to invest, right?

That also sounds like a good alternative!

To start with, yes. I'm just a college student, I don't have that much money anyways. I think I'll probably buy some more over a longer peroid of time.

I think a wallet that costs more than 10% of the amount on it is a little bit overkill. The Ledger products both look more suited for my needs although they are a little bit more expensive (HW1 is 27€ where I live).
What exactly do you mean by it "taking more time to spend from it"?
@_date: 2016-09-29 18:37:12
I see. I'm intending to use the wallet as a long time bitcoin storage so I guess I'm gonna be fine with the Ledger.
Thanks for you answer!

Sorry to highjack this comment. I have an old Ledger Nano (not S) which is not supported anymore. Is this going to be a problem for the upcoming chain split?
