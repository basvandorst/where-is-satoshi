Being forced to radio sort of indicates to me a very severe situation.  I would guess that under a situation where free communications were severely restricted, any attempt to carry on data conversations would result in a very quick visit from a drone.

In the long run, I'd like to pay for everything in bitcoin, but for now I need to hodl as many as I possibly can. The more I have when the price booms again, the better. I'm sure we all can relate.

you click on the link, dummy.
no the sound is bad. the girl is meh. the graphics are...there are no graphics. you expect anyone to listen through that?

Bitcoin taxing, they are taxing virtual things. Probably they were facing huge losses in income tax.
@_date: 2014-07-28 10:41:42
Great news, we all need to grow bitcoin usage in one way or another too, like a grocery shop accepting bitcons and more, with this effect we can actually rise the price and create awareness too..

That's pretty old. Not one of his best versions though. Some of the others are  pretty funny.

No one wants to do anything except speculate on price!

That's a good news. Educating general public about cryptos is nice idea to spread awareness.
@_date: 2014-07-14 09:22:27
thanks for that. you should post that in the press-section
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:45:53
Bitcoin atms are useless atm, not many people know about BTC..specially the general public.
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:46:55
Thats really great news for everyone

About ten years ago I got interested enough in all the funny noises on radio bands and got an RX320 radio then ported some software to my operating system of choice.  Someone told me that they were 'computers talking' when I was a kid (70's) and I always wondered what they were saying to one another.  I found that there are a lot of modulation types and it is quite possible to receive data from all over the Pacific at least.  I went back to work about that time and have yet to get back into the hobby.

Seen this one, but always good for a smile.

I use Safari and it's quite ok for me even it's less anonymous! I think if you want to safe your wallet it is better to have cold wallet. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:15:46
I started using it as soon as it had appeared and really enjoy it, hope this number will be much bigger in the near future!

What happens with the assets (btc/usd) for which there will be no "proofs of claims" filled, would they be redistributed to people who (will) fill such claims?
@_date: 2014-08-30 15:57:13
If you want to give me 0.1 BTC I would be happy to receive it in any form. I think papper wallet is the best choice for 0.1
@_date: 2014-07-28 10:38:17
My current belief is that while it might be possible to keep any eye on things like spot prices and such, but again, I imagine that any attempt to actually send would be nothing more than a beacon telling the authorities where to find you.  Or at least your radio gear.
@_date: 2014-08-09 12:52:27
Good to see it's back!
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:26:25
if I be there I'll visit it!
@_date: 2014-03-13 22:41:31
Yep, fuck that! Don't need to pay more additional fees! 
@_date: 2014-08-18 05:18:25
I have a sense New York will eventually find a way to be that
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:58:38
I am also curious what caused this poor end 
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:18:48
the whole thing is not too much complicated, I'm very glad to know that lots of newcomers start using it! just don't be afraid of it
@_date: 2014-02-11 11:17:48
Bitcoins have value because they are useful and because they are scarce
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:20:36
Wow, I haven't read something better that it for a long time, exellent!
@_date: 2014-09-06 12:37:42
Yeah, but why exactly have you posted this? I don't know what the point of discussion is here, though I'm sure it's been posted many times before.
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:44:20
Backdoored how?
@_date: 2014-07-13 18:47:20
t's usable even if it's 0.01$ or even less. You and me can trade even if noone else wants to use it. But yeah...point is...Williams is gonna get his ass raped 31.6 (figuratively speaking ofc) on Internet

I disagree with you, it's pretty good mail though I used to work mostly with gmail  - I like the interface of gmail a lot 
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:43:19
all that would do is crash the price "value" and then Bitcoin would have to compete with all the other "Quality" crypto (i can think of about 10) and that's only what i know of.

1000-for-1 price split! 1 BTC = $0.50

Are there other companies that has spent the last years working on an intelligent vending machine?
@_date: 2014-08-18 05:18:58
It will cause a lot of controversy that's for sure. He's already in hiding since it's so big... By selling his coins he basically throws away all of the credit for his work as it simply says that he would rather a fiat currency. Do you mean exchange or spend as in send his bitcoins to other addresses?
@_date: 2014-02-11 11:20:36
Excellent article. but there is a couple of controversial moments
@_date: 2014-03-13 22:52:25
"Two recent Bitcoin exchange failures and the death of a Bitcoin CEO have thrown a pall over Bitcoin in the minds of many."
Despite this bitcoin is still good financial instrument 
@_date: 2014-09-14 21:41:14
Wow, this is huge and can help stabilize Bitcoin price once and for all.
@_date: 2014-07-21 06:57:20
Would rather not have had the banks being massively greedy and corrupt in the first place to be honest. Everyone has been screwed thanks to the irresponsible actions of banks and governments.
@_date: 2014-07-21 06:57:23
Sure Bitcoin was born partially out of the mistrust of banks and the restrictions they impose on our own money - but this alone tells a story about what is wrong with the world.
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:12:30
“Digital currencies … may have more conceptual similarities to commodities, such as gold, than money” 
I think the same  - BTC is a gold not like fiat money at all! 
@_date: 2014-08-30 15:57:35
100% not going to happen, it is not part of the amazon profit plan and owning blockchain.info won't bring them profits.
