Please donate to the excellent researchers that are researching chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), a relatively common life-destroying illness that strikes young people for which until recently, very little research funding was allocated by funding bodies like the US National Institutes of Health. 
To put it into perspective, until recently the NIH allocated about $5 million per annuum to this illness for the last 20 years, which is peanuts. Compared to CFS, there are about half as many people with multiple sclerosis, and the disease has a similar suffering and disability profile, and gets about $100 million per annuum. In other words, the ratio of dollars spent per patient is shockingly low.
The good news is, there is new awareness about the illness (see the documentary [Unrest]( for example). The [NIH very recently also opened up CFS research centers]( and other countries are also showing signs of wanting to solve this problem.
Unfortunately, the research funding continues to be too low to make any real progress. The current system in place works well for diseases that are somewhat understood (you need funding to make progress, and results to get funding, and it's hard to get results with a poorly understood illness while having too little funding, and researchers tend to go where the funding is, etc.). What we need is to give this research a push with an infusion of money. If you could donate a million or more it would help tremendously. Many patients are already donating but there's only so much sick and disabled people can do.
I can recommend several excellent research teams that will use donations wisely:
The [Open Medicine Foundation](
The [Cornell Center for Enervating NeuroImmune Disease](
The [Columbia Center for Infection and Immunity]( that the donation is for CFS).
The [Unutmaz Lab]( at the Jackson laboratory (specify that the donation is for CFS).
