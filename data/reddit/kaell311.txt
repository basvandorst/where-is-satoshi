You cannot have absolute morality WITH a god. It's the whim of some magic man, relative to his/her feelings at the time. And in the case of the Xian one, pretty shifty feelings at that. My 4yo has better morals. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 16:15:32
Every shitty religion claims theirs are the words of god(s). Yours isn't special. It's plainly crap made up by people of the time it was written. Attributed to Superman so it would carry more weight. 
Basing your morals off this archaic text is ludicrous. And often downright evil.

I hope to see some form rules for tax treatment of Bitcoin in the U.S.  Rather than having to guess. Last I looked it was unclear how it'd be treated.

Hey. I've been viewing the MtGox price this whole time. Imagine my feeling when I saw bitcoin was down to $150. I just realized its actually at about $500 and I'm ecstatic!

For many people itemizing doesn't save money. So saving all that stuff is just wasted time.

That's what I was thinking. Sounds like work though for extremely small chance of gain. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:45:21
I thought it was at like $150. Where you get $500? Or did you mean $50?
Edit: never mind. That's MtGox price on bitcoincharts. Sweet I have like 10x as much money as I thought I did.

@_date: 2014-06-26 16:27:57
As are LLCs. LLC does _not_ stand for limited liability corporation (as many would incorrectly tell you). It stands for limited liability COMPANY. They may elect to be taxed as a corporation (S-corp, or C-corp), or they may elect to be taxed as a disregarded entity.

They have interpretations to handle such things. They consider you still having control of them. It doesn't matter where it is. You may be required to present your friend to substantiate your claim. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:23:53
Then yes, it's taxed. You can't circumvent income tax via barter.
Most such transactions are "under the table" work though. Which is work you illegally do not report to the IRS. They probably wouldn't really care for things like that but if you make a point of bringing it up in an audit they will probably tax you on it and make you pay penalties for not originally reporting it.
It's like speeding. Going 62 in a 60 is illegal.  
@_date: 2014-03-27 05:16:38
If you do it on a regular basis they may conclude you're intentionally doing it for the purpose of avoiding taxes. They do not take kindly to such things and many people have done many similar things before Bitcoin. They've developed ways of bringing the hammer down on you if you get caught. It's up to you if it's worth the risk. I don't want to risk prison over a few thousand dollars.

A company is a business consisting of one or more people. 
These companies can have various legal structures. 
There are sole propietorships, partnerships, LLC/PLLCs (which can elect to be taxed as S-corps, C-corps, or sole/partnerships/disregarded-entities), S-corps, and C-corps. 
"Corporation" in most contexts refers to C-corps. In some cases is also includes S-corps. And in some cases LLCs electing to be taxes as such.
@_date: 2014-05-04 07:17:34
I get paid to accept and use credit cards. They're better than free. I pay no money for them. I get products for cheaper with them. Plus extra features. They don't cost anything. 
I'm aware of how/why all these things are free. Some other people aren't. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 04:51:29
I think the answer is that a gift like that ¿isn't taxed? Up to a certain amount. If you get audited they will decide if it actually a gift or if it were payment and you were trying to avoid taxes by lying, in which case you're pound me in the ass prison fucked.

If they want to do the work to familiarize themselves with Bitcoin, this should work. I doubt they want to due to cost benefit ratio. So they just don't allow it.

If you are happy with the volatility level and you want to bet the price will go up, yes.

I also worked as a waiter there. We had to tip out the bussers but not much. We made min wage plus tips, ended up being about 3x min wage on average. And we have one of the nations highest min wages. 
So I have difficulty sympathizing with the complaints about not tipping and whatnot that others have for WA workers. I've been one in WA and it was great.
