I will write in both English and Portuguese, as it's some sort of feedback to you but also food for thought for the Brazilian people here.
The ATM smells of a publicity stunt which will backfire. Not trying to be a downer here, but I fail to see what good this could possibly bring in the long term.
I also really want to see Bitcoin succeed as a currency and as a global payment system. In order to get there, there is no need for an ATM. In fact it is backwards. The banking industry in Brazil is pretty advanced. Transactions are done in realtime and customers have tons of security features. Big retail banks offer cost-free checking and savings accounts for people that use only internet banking. None of this is true in the US, so it makes sense for them to try to develop a "better ATM". The part where Brazil can benefit from Bitcoin is by being a monetary/banking system for the non-consumers. The "emerging C class". The ones who make all their purchases either in cash or by store-offered installment payments.
You guys were working on this before and offering a payment solution. That was a good start. It is still expensive, but it was a step in the right direction.
Now, the whole model where I disagree with MB and which keeps me away from it is the *outrageous* fees of 2% for deposits. This is absolutely insane. Think about it: **you guys want to be paid to get my money**. This is absolute non-sense. Same thing with this whole "buy BTC on the ATM, and we will make money on the commission". While the speech is "we believe in BTC", the action is screaming "we only care about taking your fiat and going to the bank".
I understand you have costs and that you want to make a profit. But until you don't change your model, I won't be parking my money there. Suggestion: make deposits free for everyone that keeps a minimum balance of R$100,00 in the past 30 days, otherwise charge R$10.
Esse anúncio de colocar o ATM parece um golpe de publicidade que não vai dar em nada. Não estou querendo ser pessimista, mas não vejo qual o benefício que isso vai trazer no futuro. Se você (como eu) quer que o Bitcoin vingue, não precisa de nada como um ATM. Fica sendo até contraditório. Os bancos no Brasil até que funcionam bem. Transações são feitas em tempo-real no país todo. Os bancos investem e oferecem muitos recursos em segurança. QUem tem conta online apenas consegue fazer tudo sem custo nenhum. Isso é muito melhor que nos EUA - por exemplo - que tem bancos de investimento sofisticados mas o mercado de varejo é muito fraco. Pra eles faz sentido ter um ATM. Para nós, não.
Vocês tem que ir atrás de quem não é bancarizado. Classe C, o povão que só consegue fazer compra em dinheiro ou em financiamento de loja, estilo Casas Bahia. Esse pessoal não tem acesso a produtos bancários, mas está começando a ter dinheiro sobrando no bolso e começando a consumir. Se vocês tiverem como atender a eles, aí sim o bitcoin pode realizar o potencial no Brasil.
Vocês começaram bem quando fizeram o sistema de pagamento. Parece caro, mas efetivo. Não consegui encontrar nenhum vendedor no Brasil ainda que use o sistema, mas assim que vcs tiverem fechado o lado de oferta a coisa engrena.
Agora, a parte que realmente me desagrada no MB é o fato de vocês cobrarem para depósitos. Isso é ridículo. Pensa bem: **vocês estão querendo ser pagos para ficar com meu dinheiro**. Todo banco no resto do mundo paga para obter clientes, e vcs querem cobrar pelo privilégio? Isso só faria sentido se o único lugar para se comprar BTC/LTC fosse com vocês, mas felizmente não existe monopólio, não é?
O lance do ATM é a mesma coisa. Vocês falam que "acreditam no bitcoin", mas no fundo só querem ficar com Real. Eu entendo que vocês tem custos e que vocês estão fazendo isso para ter lucro, mas esse modelo proposto por vocês é absurdo, e enquanto isso não mudar eu não vou manter meu dinheiro com vocês. Minha sugestão: faça com que os depósitos sejam de graça para todo mundo que mantiver um saldo mínimo de R$100 na conta por 30 dias. Quem ficar abaixo desse valor paga R$10 no mês.

For the same reason that Brazil has the most expensive Playstation 4 in the world. Import tax.

I might be wrong on this one, but it seems that the Lamassu is a machine where you *buy* BTC.
If you are right and indeed the Lamassu is a machine that *sells* them, then I would be more than happy to see them. I will be able to just camp in front of it and buy whatever people to sell, undercutting their commission.
Edit. From their website:








So no. The machine receives money which needs to be transported/deposited somewhere else.

Yes, there is. What you and OP seem to be missing is that "DNS for Bitcoin" would require either:
 - a central authority and a whole bunch of infrastructure to control address ownership/verification
 - Namecoin
The idea is dangerously stupid, and goes against KISS. No serious developer will take onto it. The reason: what OP needs is simple, it's called "Address Book". Just have a client app that can search through your contacts and copy/paste the address of the recipient. It's personal and does not require changes in the existing infrastructure, much less error-prone and solves the original problem much more efficiently.

Oh, man... have you read what I said about the case with NCR when trying testing their ATMs in Brazil? "6mm steel"? That is nothing! Does the Lamassu contain an internal device that perfurates all bills in case of any attempted breach? Does it contain anti-vandalism sensors that call the police/security if the machine is slightly tilted? Does it contain 3 layers of trussed metal so hard it breaks drills?
The guys here can be much more sophisticated than you can imagine. If you are comparing the Lamassu with the ATM's you see in the US, maybe. But any developed country does not face the amount of violence and crime that people in Brazil see. So the security there has to be infinitely better. Americans are used to complain about TSA measures, let them see how it is to go to a bank in Brazil. In the US, I can go to Walmart and find a branch open without not one security guard. In Brazil, all bank branches contain revolving doors with metal detectors. You can only get in after putting your keys and your belt in a dispenser. Every corner of the branch has a armed guard behind a metal door. Last year there was a law in São Paulo forbidding usage of cell phones while inside 
Also, very few retail business ATMs. ATMs here are not allowed to charge for withdrawals, so there is very little incentive for business to keep an ATM. You can't go to a bar or a deli like in American cities and expect to have an ATM. It just doesn't work like that. Debit cards are largely accepted. "Cash-only" bars do not exist. 
I stand by what I said. ATMs in Brazil are going extinct due to all of the security costs and for being mostly obsolete. It makes no sense to have them there. In large cities, you will usually find them at bank branches and large commerce areas like malls. No convenience stores is willing to pay for insurance. Maybe (maybe!) you can find an ATM at some big 24h gas station, and even then they keep less money and limit withdrawals to R$100 (US$40) from 10PM to 6AM.

Two things:
 - Both models are only "one day's worth of cash", or whatever period T we have for stocking/collection of cash. What you are saying is that thieves can only attack on t(0), where t(0) = {full on cash for normal ATMs, empty for Lamassu}. This makes no sense. Thieves can go attack on t(T), meaning it would be a few moments before money collection by the operator. It would be full just as well.
 - Who pays for the operator who "transports/deposits the money elsewhere"? It is not magic, and it is not included in the cost of Lamassu. If you are a bank these costs are marginal compared to the amount of money they make. In the case of whoever buys one of these, not so much.
Now, if the eventual buyer of this ATM already has another business that requires transportation of values, then maybe it might make sense. If the machine allows both buying/selling of BTC, then you can offload the cash to BTC buyers and the ATM won't have to have lots of cash - eliminating the need for a "operator" or transport service. But as it stands, it still is as much of a target as any cash registers, and one with very weak security compared to normal ATM's.

None of these FX-&gt; BTC ATMs would last a day in any big city in Brazil. Not even Lamassu's. The amount of security and anti-theft measures required by banks when purchasing ATMs* is insane. Keep in mind that is quite common to have news in Brazil about thieves blowing up ATMs and hauling the vaults in trucks.
There is no insurance company that will touch this. And 2.5% percent would require A LOT of volume per machine to justify the cost of hiring a security company that manages the transportation of this money. Basically, the only way this can succeed in Brazil is if the ATM can hand out cash as well, so it won't be so much of a target and it eliminates the need of transport of values.
\* Story time: Just this weekend I was talking with a guy who worked on the development of the application code of the first ATMs coming to Brazil in the 80's. He was telling me that NCR  - one of the largest manufactures in the US - that NCR managed to win a bid with Bradesco (one of the largest retail banks here). One of the requisites from the security people was that the vault should be able to withstand 50 minutes of direct attacks without breaking open.
NCR's got pwned in 2.

I was excited for the news, then I realized (a) it is just for Campus Party and (b) it is from MercadoBitcoin. They need to have some serious competition. 2% + R$1,99 fee for *deposits* is ridiculous. But when the government introduces a fee of 6+% just for using your international credit card for purchases overseas, it makes it understandable why MB can get away with it.
And unlike the US, the banking industry in Brazil is reasonably advanced. When I moved to the US I could not believe that it took 2-3 business days for a bank to complete a transaction on my debit card. All those years having to deal with hyperinflation forced the banks to have immediate, safe transactions. Checks are not so common, but it's very safe due to the many anti-fraud techniques used. Internet Banking has so many security features  (2 factor authentication via token or smart card, no password is ever typed as a measure to avoid keyloggers, etc) it would take much less work to educate people about how to manage bitcoins...
But I digress. What I really want to see is someone to come up and reduce this 10% price difference between Bitstamp and MB, and the amount of fees that MB have make it impossible.

Said pretty much the same thing about it one month ago: 
The only thing I see against it is I stayed at many hostels where they have some informal money exchange as well, allowing guests to get local currency at a price above bank rates but (much) cheaper than the exchanges at airports and such. Adopting bitcoin could be potentially destroy this revenue source.

Not a full phone provider, but [DiamondCard]( offers a decent SIP solution and they accept bitcoin as payment.
In fact, forget the switch provider part and cut them out altogether. I realized that I spend most of my day close to a wi-fi connection, so I just got a prepaid sim card, Google Voice, and a DID number: whenever I'm on wi-fi, GV forwards my calls to my DID number, and I talk on the SIP. If not on wi-fi (rarely) it forwards to the prepaid number. I am averaging less than $10/month this way, including the ~$2/month I pay for the DID.

Hostels. Imagine you are traveling around Latin America, Asia or European countries that haven't adopted the Euro. Instead of having to pay ridiculous exchange fees every time you go to a new country, you just check-in at the hostel and can pay with bitcoins and/or exchange for local currency. Start with hostels.com or hostelworld. Partner with them so they start evangelizing the benefits of bitcoin to hostel managers and owners. You have a younger consumer demographic, reasonably tech-savvy who has a clear pain point.
