Bitcoin is an open, transparent, peer to peer network of "money" that replaces the need of an intermediary like a bank. It is native of the internet, allowing people to send "money" or value nearly instantly at nearly zero cost. Like the internet, it is not owned  by anyone. What BitTorrent did to music and software, Bitcoin does to money.

Have you done your part to prevent ad hominem attacks on reddit today?

Blockchain has given me similar issues when looking up the public ledger, it won't show the balance or history of transactions even though there is one. I don't have an account so I can't speak to that.

This is a valid point. At the moment, there is a lack of most of the financial services that banks provide, mainly fraud protection in Bitcoin . This is not to saythat it is impossible to provide that with crypto currencies, there exist a whole enterprise waiting to be tapped into as soon as banks or entrepreneurs enter that crypto market. Bitcoin provides options, much like Skype is now the greatest resource for long distance calling, because why would i pay for a service that I can download for free? Right now, you are right. Let's see what's up in 5 years.

Maybe you won't. If the network can be built up, providing a different function than the existing, the analogy of MySpace to Facebook is no longer appropriate. It would be more of a Facebook to Twitter analogy. Different, complimentary, and serving their respective purposes.

He did say that there shouldn't be altcoins, something I disagree with. Specially with such a young technology with so much disruptive potential. He does have a point that altcoins don't seem to compete with Bitcoin, only each other. Time will tell if that's how it will be once that pesky 'mainstream adoption' happens.

I think that altcoins is what makes it great. Once adoption becomes the norm, people's skepticism of a completely decentralized digital currency will disappear. Once there, altcoins will provide people with choices. Bitcoin's libertarian philosophical underpinning might be a turn off for someone less idealistic, well you can have an altcoin with inflation and distribution happening throughout the network. The amazing thing that has never happened before is that those two currencies can live in the same economic system in parallel without friction. You can literally put your money where your ideology is and that's exciting to me.

Lol got that wrong i stand corrected thieflar.

My future binoculars can only see so far. But in all seriousness, maybe you are right. That's why i am so interested in ether once they release it. It'll be interesting to see what happens. At any rate, in the parallel universe in which cryptocurrencies are the norm, competing altcoins, though not as big as bitcoin could still have enormous utility.
Look, i agree that focus should be on developing the blockchain technology with the largest network. That's what is happening. I also agree that copy and paste altcoins with no innovation are the result of greed. Those are rapidly fazed out. Where we depart is when you imply that there is nothing good about developing alternatives to Bitcoin, especially when those alternatives can exist simultaneously to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has NOT stood the test of time.

But it's not a very good store of value either, at least not yet.

I say definitely get a mortgage out and sell everything to buy more bitcoin, or do some of your own research instead of asking a forum for investment advice. There's no knowing the price in 60 days.

I mean it's not unreasonable to assume this type of comment is serious looking at this ecosystem lol
