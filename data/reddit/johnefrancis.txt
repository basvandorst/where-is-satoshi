I'm a cavirtex customer. I feel they are solid. That being said, I don't leave BTC or fiat there or anywhere else. It's not insured against theft/fraud. Neither should you. Deposit, trade, withdraw. I maintain a number of hot/cold wallets under my exclusive control (no services!), many eggs, many baskets. If one gets hacked, it's not the end of the world.

no real reason to leave much of a balance in an exchange's account, no interest paid, etc. Why not just keep it in a regular non-online wallet?

I love Bitcoin because it gives me an excuse to run my CPU fan at 105% for months on end.

One consideration: what commitment did you make to keeping confidential the relationship between that address and identifying information when conducting your business? Somewhat like the "data used only for original agreed purposes" principal of many privacy laws. 
However, I think that the privacy considerations are of lower priority to  reporting a theft of 29K BTC magnitude. I wouldn't consider reporting it for 0.29 or 29BTC, but 29K?

I noticed startup time seemed much, much faster in 0.5.2 vs. 0.5.1.

so, the conclusion could be: online transactions, regardless of the medium of exchange, aren't anonymous.
It's interesting to consider - have you ever really participated in real-life anonymous transactions? I think that anonymity is less the issue than maintaining the privacy of the transaction to only the participants.

standard fiat govt. issued "cash" is still more anonymous than generic bitcoin, and much, much more anonymous than trading on well-known exchanges like MtGox. 
Cash has serial  but cash transactions don't record them. 
Better anonymity comes from commodity exchanges - no serial numbers on gallons of oil, hours of labour, etc.

How did you reach bitcoinblackfriday? I'm hoping they can get coinbase to suspend the wallet - payments were being processed via coinbase this morning.

I'm probably not the worst off. 
I ended up there because I wasn't able to get BFL's Black Friday Deal to go through last night for their upcoming 300GH thingy. So, I went off to  to see what else might be available. I can't figure out how to contact the editors of that Wiki or edit its pages to get the Xtreme Miners off the ASIC listing. 
Read that coinbase had suspended their wallet at some point, but I can't get thru to them either.

Order fully refunded. Can show in blockchain if anyone is that interested. 
Still would recommend anyone considering a purchase to get good paperwork for it.

I am increasingly feeling they are a scam, but there is still some doubt. We'll see if they refund my 5.3, or cough up some real German company registration info. &lt;vigorous head slap&gt;

They refunded them directly. Would not trust without proper legal assurances.
