Mychoicecorporate was declined today in the EU. No emails from them or wavecrest. Anyone any further info?

Need new ones asap. Keep me posted please.

I have used tails on a USB in the past that is not connected to the internet. You back up these usbs and put them in various locations.

Sorry for your loss. I feel like that too though. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:21:25
Thinkin the exact same, is there a dump coming

In before somebody says "only invest what you are prepared to lose"
Sorry for loss. Welcome to crypto.

I feel your pain but the mistake here was paypal.

Maybe in murica.

No one ever puts a timezone on these.

If a tree falls in the forest but nobody heard it does the sound exist?

In before don't invest what you cant afford to lose. It could bounce back.

Can u hunt the buyer down. I'll skin him for ya. Just point him out.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:40:38
Care to elaborate?

They could also mean bitcoin or any crypto could just go pop one day and it would be gone. 
There are no guarantees, it will always go back up, (likely at the moment but anything can happen)

You don't need approval of the tribe.

I wouldn't tell her. Or if u did tell her its way less. Bitches be like buy me dem tings and stuff. If she is anything like the women I know, she would have it spent before you have it cashed out. 
PS if you are in USA I would defo not cash it out there.

If it goes up it wouldn't be stupid at all.
If it goes down then that would be stupid. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:29:32
From what i can gather they just have it labelled wrong. mBCC would be like mBTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:09:30
I am not familiar with the wallet you have used but your post is only 17 minutes old so maybe give it a few more minutes.
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:37:44
Addresses, see what you did there ;)

I have respect for anyone who mines, doesn't matter what nationality or race they are. Don't see why you don't like them?
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:08:22
Shapeshift will ride you on fees. 
Id look at another proper exchange. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:18:40
They should yes.
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:16:04
Game over. Move along.
