Coinfloor is safe to use. But I think their minimum deposit is £1000 but might have changed you’d have to have a look

I think what they mean by this term is that the price has gone up so high before the halvening that the price won’t go up any higher than 13k before the halvening. So the price is in for the halvening. Then after it will go up
This is my understanding I might be wrong

The term only relative if you believe in the 4 year cycle that being 2or3year uptrend and 1or2 year downtrend. Which coincidentally coincides the halvening term which is every 4 years in a perfect  world it would be 3 years up and 1 year down but it’s not a perfect world.

Oh so does that mean we are near the top? 
If this is true and the bear market continues how long will it go and is there a good indicator for it?
