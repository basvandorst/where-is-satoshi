Kodak was a marvelous company for a number of years that poured all of its profits back into its workers.
Like the banks there was little reason to innovate because they dominated the market. Unlike the banks every penny of that company was distributed to the employees from low level to high. The common saying in this area back in the 60s was that if you got a job at Kodak out of Highschool you were set for life. The company was very generous with its benefits and the employees did not have to work that hard. Unfortunately the bureaucracy of the organization became akin to that of government and quick innovation and forward thinking ideas were stifled at every level.

Lol my thoughts exactly. It was great while it lasted but shut down because it competed directly with fractional reserve banking. Thanks to a couple nuckle heads in Texas. Lost about $19,000, but life goes on, fun while it lasted. I do wonder what happened to that almost 2 billion dollars ��‍♂️
