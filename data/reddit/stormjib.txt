I've lost about 80 k on sailboats in the last 10 years,  of which I could recoup about 45 k if I sold them.   Makes what I have lost  on Bitcoin seem insignificant by comparison.    I still have the bitcoin,  I believe it will eventually turn around.

I spend about 20k a year annually on boat stuff,  so I've had practice at losing money carelessly.    I'm 2/3 the way through a bow sprit project that's looking like it's going to cost me 9 grand.    So to me this speculation is just that,   maybe it burns, maybe it grows.  I don't know,  I wish we would all care about some of the ideas pertaining to bitcoin.   Decentralization is a powerful concept,   helping spread adoption and usage is more important than large gains.    It's kind of like how I deliberately eat 4 entrees a week from my new Mexican restaurant Tacolicious, on Fischer Boulevard in Toms River, NJ.  The guy has good food,  I genuinely want him to make it,  I purposely bring him more business towards that goal.    I give away my free meal punch cards so others can try etc.      I want to learn to help build bitcoin.    I have only been in since about mid December.

When you factor in removal of armored trucks, physical banks themselves,  bank personal,  I suspect bitcoin could be painted quite green.   Think about how  many low value personal checks are driven around in cars to be deposited in banks or atm.    Bitcoin dramatically lowers need for all of this physical movement.

To be truly challenging, a voyage, like a life, must rest on a firm foundation of financial unrest. Otherwise you are doomed to a routine traverse, the kind known to yachtsmen, who play with their boats at — "cruising," it is called. Voyaging belongs to seamen, and to the wanderers of the world who cannot, or will not, fit in. If you are contemplating a voyage and you have the means, abandon the venture until your fortunes change. Only then will you know what the sea is all about.

I don't think your bet is unreasonable,  I'd take the other side of that bet for a sum of 0.005 BTC settled on 8/4/2019 for fun.   If it hits 15 k USD you win.   Price doesn't hit $15 k,  I win. (More than 0.005 is more than I wish to gamble.) 
(Let me know if you want to, I really don't care about the bet either way, just seemed like something to do)

I'm in the inexperienced group you describe.    There's a few things I might have done differently.    Particularly if I took a loss of a few hundred earlier,  at this point I could have bought in cheaper.    This is all with the benefit of hindsight,   and also as you point out no knowledge of investments, markets,  etc.  There will be some costly lessons to learn.     I'm going to just stay on the ride at this point.

Idolize would imply elevating to a gilded status possibly more than the sum of its parts.   I believe the other comments are referring to the act of doing due diligence and fact checking the things people say.   Nothing's wrong with admiration,  just realize nobody among us is truly an oracle.

2020 self will thank you.  Or not.    Anyway,   I got in at 17,400, 15,600, and 14,000.  If we fall to the 8k mark I think I'll get more.    I'm deep in the red at this moment,  and it is like oh well.  I believe to be speculating you have to be open and comfortable with loss.   Technically you are still well in the positive.     Let's all work to build this thing,  function and adoption is what's important over price.

No pressure, you can cut the amount bet  in half just the same.   I look at it as if I lose, I still win because gains from BTC rise cover the gambling loss.  
I personally think we will see sub 9k at points still, I don't discount the possibility of anything.  You only said hit, not hold or maintain a given level.  
Time will tell.   All I know is compared to mainstream society, we are way out in left field - hopefully that does not hurt the potential of bitcoin in the coming few years.

I'd ideally like to find a partner in my boat.    It's closer to a 40 k boat, and only because that's near top of what the market will bear.   The boat has had 70 k of improvements between 2012 and present.    I'd dump whatever a partner contributed into further improvements and amenities,  then sail abroad with individual that bought in.  Splitting provisioning, watches, everything.   It's basically ocean cruising at a discount as one could not get a more recently upgraded boat of similar displacement for money.   I have put about 15 k of improvements into boat myself this year.    I'm interested in going to far Pacific, and high latitudes.  I'm flexible in regards to destination.   For an individual that has high liquidity and would like to experience sailing passage making and world cruising I offer a scaffolded experience with lower cost point of entry compared to other options.

The means of noncentralized exchange has been created by people that wanted a currency that could not be manipulated by a third party.     It was built and labored over when there was no reward,   just hard work.   They believed in it.   The variety of fiat currencies that exist suffer losses when funds need to reach across borders.     
When people sell during sharp downward events,   they are boot lickers.  They are running back into the arms of the establishment.   The same one that dilutes currency, sets interests rates,  reducing buying power ensuring  your  enslavement.     There will only ever be 21 million units of this Bitcoin,   if you can see that you would want the ability to exchange freely,   others will want that too.  Growth will come.    If you believe,  if you share it,  and spread it,  growth will come.      
Walk or run towards this, is your choice.  Every time we make a purchase,  we cast a vote for what we want the world to be.    Which system do you prefer?   Begin to utilize it,   and work for it.  If you are entering this Bitcoin world with hopes for fiat currency,   you have come for the wrong reasons.

Dave helped me too.  Sometimes I wish there was a role to be played to help new crypto users avoid mistakes.   There is a long learning curve to Bitcoin and opinions of what best practices are is not uniform. 
At least worst practices are quite well known, and the community is generally helpful.  Even still, with this information available, people make poor choices.  I have a friend that has a significant amount of bitcoin sitting on coinbase.  I told him to get a Trezor and secure his funds, not sure if he listened yet.

My primary interest in BTC was not as and investment vehicle.  Just wanted to pay for what I wanted, and be on my way.   I never got the guts to go darknet, hence, never bought bitcoin. Never really understood the currency moderately well until August when I started noticing one of my sailing friends getting into it.  Seeing the increased media attention etc woke me up.    
To all reading,  I would offer a full day of sailing to anyone who gives me 0.009 BTC  I have two sailboats, a Westsail 32 and a Bristol 27.   I have a Captains Lic,   and 30 years experience.    If 50 people take my offer,  I'll quit my hospital RN job.    I will become the Bitcoin sailor in New Orleans.

I feel people should make an effort to use it,   if people work and provide services and put bitcoins in the hands of the many.      This is about separation of government and money I hope,  people should be free to exchange value.

Not everyone is in their right mind.    Being too rational is a limitation and can prevent development.   I would say a person who has what they need, and has much BTC might do such a thing.    I sent a grand to a hurricane victim in BVI from a couch in Nevada.   Never met the guy,  and he doesn't even know I gave it,  fund was set up by his friend from 59° North Sailing, Andy Schnell.       Paul Exner,  of Modern Geographic Sailing lost his home,  and has damage to his sailing vessel Solstice if anyone else wishes to help his family.

Where do you live?   First move is to purchase a second hand copy of David Seidmann,  The Complete Sailor.   Second move is get a copy of Mario Bigon,  Marrow Book of Knots.   Both very digestible.   Any way I can help, let me know.   Buying a sailboat is late stage,  crew with others and learn your preferences,  then get a boat.   If you truly cannot wait,  get a small simple and affordable first boat.    Sorry all for being off subject.

I can promote bitcoin with my sailboat.   I have a 10 ton cutter on Lake Ponchatrain,  I would take people on sails on Lake Ponchatrain,  multiple times a day and assist people with setting up first bitcoin purchase,  wallets etc.  I would gladly enter contact with R/Bitcoin to allow r/bitcoin to schedule bookings for dates/times earning commission so I could be a profit leg for sub.     The sailing would be paid for by the clients educated.    Sails scheduled by R BTC would receive an agreed upon commission paid to R/Bitcoin
I'm positioned in a destination location,   so the effects would be broad.    I believe I can provide lasting value to the sub.  I'm presently novice in regards to Bitcoin, but I'm learning.   My interest is not driving price,  but driving adoption and creating a better system.          I have worked as a registered nurse for six years,   and I would like to see how Bitcoin could revolutionize supply and billing systems in healthcare/insurance for dramatic efficiency improvements.   I hold a 25 Ton USCG Inland Masters Licence and have 30 years sailing experience.     Please group believe in me,  and put me to work.

I have made a purchase,  and have helped 5 people open their first wallets and receive their first transactions.    I don't believe I know everything,  it is actually hard to sort it all out upon arrival.

Consider rolling out your token with Ravencoin,  it will allow unique digital tokens as well as groups of coins,  either fixed issuance,  or able to release more.   It frees you from burden of creating your own token / network,  and allows you to be on a functioning network day 1.  That functionality should roll out end of year.  There is a meet up in NH in October I'm attending in regards to this coin.    My interest is sailing.

The distortion of the fork narrative is a large threat.    I feel most people by a long shot are not in crypto,   and people could feel like they could get a bigger piece of the pie by betting on BCH.    It is not a bet I feel comfortable making.     I fomo in Dec,  and really it was something I should of explored in 2013.   I was interested in DNM,  but I took the tech of Bitcoin for granted,  I just assumed it was like a photo attachment of a file.   I never considered of what great importance the network itself is in willing BTC into creation.
I trust the people who got it so far,  I am actually pleased to have paid the high prices in Dec/Jan as I dreamed of crypto while working my fish counter job years ago.   I remember shooting the shit with Tom and Alex about digitally exchangeable tokens.    I did not have or develop the skills to bring that vision closer to reality,  but "You" all with BTC and the crypto world went and built it,  I just had to buy it.    Honestly,  I would have spent more on travel and conferences over the years getting into Bitcoin than I currently hold.
Rambling I know,  but I feel like I have been dropped into the jungle of this crypto world,  I'm not native, and nothing is certain, so it is easy to have doubts.    I figure the long timers have BCH from the fork,   I question if I should have the other too.  \(even though I hate the idea of it on a level\)

My opinion has shifted somewhat in regards to paying for marine work,  I have another boat in the middle of a bow sprit rebuild that is hitting the 7k mark.   To me it is wildly expensive and does not represent fair value, but truly the skills are limited and scarce, in this case stainless welding/fabrication, so the value is high.   It quite simply is very expensive, I have come to accept that.   In the former situation it was my  second large boat project done by yard and I did not understand how yard billed.   I had a complete mast rebuilt on a previous boat for $3700,  so to see a bill of $11000 was well north of what I expected.     I don't think I treated them poorly,  I just wish they didn't reject me as a person to a peer.    I paid my invoice,  what did I really do wrong as I see it.    I don't believe myself a difficult customer in the slightest.   Sorry for rant, and sorry you deal with people that cannot sum time.

I think if a BTC wallet came with a seed of BTC preloaded to be used in the escrow for Bisq,  it could help pave the way as an onramp for Bitcoin.

You wouldn't even need much RVN.  500 burn to create your unique asset chain, and I suspect another RVN for each token you wish to issue.  Install the local Cryptobridge APP as the Web app is hackable.  Download the RavenQT wallet,  you should encrypt it before sending funds to it.  Don't reuse addresses.  I'll stop by Barker Lounge when I'm up and report back on range of services &amp; prices in case it helps with planning.   I've been working on my sailing dreams since 2004.

It's true,  I simply criticized the total hours billed on work I had done to my sailboat, and it got kind of ugly,  total was way more than I expected \- 11k in total,  I paid them within a month.  3 years later this winter at an industry show,  my friend who I was with was asked by his distributor "Who brought that asshole here."  Me.   Anyway,  they are a bit of a white glove high end boat business, that if it were not for a specific wealthy individual and his love for a particular class of boat, they probably would not be doing quite as well.

Not a frustration, but it would be interesting if an app could take an audio note of what a tx is for, text to speech it and send on a monthly basis, the market value, amount sent, and appended note plus audio to a secure email like Protonmail.  
Sort of a very fluid utxo management program built into a wallet.  I'm personally a bit daunted with doing taxes for this year in sorting out numerous small buys, and a sale in profit earlier in the year.   Keeping it straight what was a payment versus what I'm holding long term is confusing.   
I'm am frustrated that Cash App rounds up the amounts purchased / transferred in confirmation emails.  Sort of messes up the info.

The public just wants their bank to work.   Lane worked with Silvergate to grow lending after 2008 crisis, growing business and lending relationships.   In 2013 Lane began to learn about Bitcoin, out of general intellectual curiosity.   
At a similar time companies (in crypto too) were getting kicked out of banks, Silvergate's Lane and their Compliance officer looked into serving this niche as a source of deposits.   
One such company was founded by Barry Silverman of Second Market,  (handles pre IPO company shares and illiquid securities, sold to NASDAQ and is now Genesis Trading). Second Market began to support Bitcoin being handled and transferred - utilizing Silvergate as their Bank.   Silvergate began to be interested in the on chain aspects of Second Markets business and the Bitcoin being moved.       
To this end Silvergate formed the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) to reduce pain points and friction in asset exchange.   Silvergate built a transactional API that allows member clients to exchange directly with each other.   This allows 24-7 frictionless instant trading for SEN members.   It is essientially bridging legacy banking into the crypto market that never sleeps.    Exchanges, hedge funds, OTC desks, investors are able to efficiently move their capital into a variety of exchanges and markets globally.    This takes place within a setting that meets all regulatory components.
Silvergate is starting to offer collateralized loans using Bitcoin as the backing asset.  Silvergate is also looking into setting up a digital asset settlement services for trades been organizations.   
They are working on building mature market infrastructure similar to what is found in legacy systems.   They are a Bank chartered in California, working on directly solving problems for their customers.   They build relationships in the institutional market with a focus on regulatory compliance.

Bitcoins network aims to produce a block every 10 minutes.  The massive amount of computing power is paid to miners and mining pools in the form of a block reward.  Each block presently has 12.5 BTC + the transaction fees of transactions in block.   Every 210,000 blocks there will be a block reward having.  The next halving will land approximately in mid May 2020.  The block reward will be cut to 6.25 BTC block reward.

Download a wallet.  Even before you buy Bitcoin.  Understand how to write the seed words in a numbered ordered list.  They will serve for recovery of your wallet if device is damaged or lost.  Failure to keep that list secure, could result in your funds being stolen.
Value appreciation is a nice part of holding Bitcoin it's not the reason for it's existence though.   The undeniable right to transact in a permissionless fashion, without approval from a third party is a big part of what makes it significant.
Read about Bitcoin, and learn what it is, how it works, and why you care about it.   Then find a reputable exchange, buy some bitcoin, and send it to the wallet you control.

Block reward gets cut in half every 210000 blocks.  The network aims to average 10 minutes per block.  So after mid May, block reward is being reduced from 12.5 BTC paid to the mining pool that discovers the next block to 6.25. This reduces the amount of new Bitcoin becoming available, the inflation rate of BTC will be lesser than major fiat currencies moving forward.

Presently, 18 million Bitcoins have been mined.   The vast majority of those have been bought, and are being held by individuals for various prices.
Given that even in the next 10 years we will see 3 halvings,  new supply is tightening.   This is all while development is happening in a great number of areas.   
Bitcoin is still very much on the fringe, but as time goes by, and Halvenings occur, it is quite likely that we will see price movement to the upside.  As people who previously held no Bitcoin seek to get some, this in itself will contribute to positive price movement.

A hardware wallet is safer because the private keys are strictly handled in a minimalistic computing environment, eg the hardware wallet, where the only functions are reading transactions, and signing transactions.

Between 20 and 60k depending on condition and how equipped.   I would say 3500 to 7k annually for slip + insurance.  Additional 2500 to 4k (or more a year keeps things maintained and occasional gradual improvements.  Like my new stove cost 2k for me to install,  new bow spirit with windlass about $4500, new main sail $2500.

I like GRIN because the light blockchain with basically next to no data in the blocks has value from a privacy perspective.   I like Ravencoin because I believe there will be application to create digital tokens that can be utilized in a variety of ways.  I'm not sure how I'll utilize my RVN, but it might serve as like a digital wooden nickel to give to sailing charter customers or who knows what.
My main interest is in the aspect that Bitcoin is not controlled by government, I do aknowledge I like the effects of price appreciation and increased buying power, but that's not why I'm here.     
      I see value in random alts in that it is not impossible that growth or adoption could come to any shitty coin, I tend to limit myself to about $40 to $100 for a project that I don't have a strong personal belief in - but given that sum at this point in the market I'd rather hold some than none of these coins.  Like I don't think DRGN chain will succeed, but hell I'll gamble a bit a small sum that I don't mind losing.  The upside is potentially great if some of the garbage takes off.

You should take responsibility for the 7 years plus that you didn't buy Bitcoin.  That was your choice.  Your view of Bitcoin at 1k, while you did miss the gain, you did not see further value at the time.  Which explains why you didn't buy then, which is ok.   Start to buy now or you'll be saying the same thing at higher price points in the future.  You are lucky to be here and know what Bitcoin is.

Mimblewimble is an interesting protocol in that a transaction is drafted, then agreed to by recipient, then published to nodes by a random walk.  This is my impression of how GRIN. Works.  UTXO state is maintained, but transactions that lead to present UTXO set are not recorded in the blockchain.   The data savings in terms of space in block is significant.

In other words not left on the exchange you bought it on.  There are mobile, computer, hardware, and paper wallets.  The first three are what I would consider.    If you want something on mobile, maybe BRD, Greenaddress, Samourai on Android.  You download the wallet app, and write down the seed words it gives you in a neat, numbered, ordered list.   If you break or lose your device, those words can be used to bring your wallet back.   Once you have your wallet installed, you will have to go to withdraw on whatever exchange you bought on.  Copy and check the address letter for letter after you paste it into the withdraw window, and you will have the exchange send the BTC to your wallet.

Gary Duncan has an in-depth expertise on the UK economy, with contacts at the highest levels among top economic policy-makers in Britain and beyond. He has interviewed leading figures including the last three Chancellors of the Exchequer, the present and previous Governors of the Bank of England,  many past and present members of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, as well as senior US policy-makers.
Duncan is highly regarded for his insight into all aspects of monetary, fiscal, and broader economic policy, as well as their impact on UK politics and the business environment.

He is adept at simplifying complex issues and presenting them in a lucid, compelling and entertaining way.

In regards to Proof of Concept,  there are a few angles that sailing / day charters / fishing boats etc. Can be marketed.  These same challenges are similar dynamics to yoga studios, small music venues, craft work shops etc. Basically any small volume niche service wants a flow of clients,  but the ability to scale up volume is extremely limited as there is limited space in all these examples.
   
 I think the would be to find a need that needs addressing within the operations of USSailing, as they are a large organization, they have a budget,  and my cousin is in a position at the second oldest yacht club in US.  He could probably tell you what a	person would want in regards to regeatta / race / junior sailing / community sailing / fleet boat maintenance etc.
         While selfishly I want a calendar/scheduling/ payments/location enabled/live chat booking/blog/hosted video/instagram feed.    ...  It probably isn't the path paved in gold.    I would be willing to pay for such a solution provided it were something I could afford.    
         Not sure what your goals are,   I believe more people could sail if some boats were dedicated to sailing.   I wish I was a sailor for the people.  I would sail my ass off.  And those sailors who would sail with me would not have to buy boats,  just sail.  Like an uber of sailing with advance scheduling capabilities.   Thanks for writing.

Would often make sense,  but my smaller boat has a value of 6k on the best day of its life,  and it has taken 15k for me to get it there.   I have it in front of my mother's house, so the ongoing expense is minimal.   The thing that crushes me is my Westsail 32 and expensive refit, things like new stove, bowspirit, Cape horn wind Vane,  windlass, and more to come.   Keeping boats is like Hodling in that your maintenance and improvement inputs depreciate by 80%  immediately.   Only by keeping, using, and loving the boat do you ever win.   The reason for this is resale value is generally wildly low compared to what you spend over the years.   I'm grateful that this is the type of problem I have in my life,  it is meaningful for me,  and it is what I work for.  I'll reach a boat upgrade cycle plateau eventually.

Bitcoin as sailing charter payment,  Calendar / Booking Tool
Is anyone aware of people working in the calendar booking / btc Payments space? 
I am interested in being able to assign BTC valuation to specific Calendar days,   pricing changes predetermined  in advance pegged how far away date is.    When a person puts down deposit,  day would be booked,   and confirmation payment would be sought closer to sailing date.   Final payment on date of sailing. 
I'm a sailor,  have two sailboats,  25 Ton Inland Master Capt licence,  and a desire to work in the charter field.  (Presently hospital RN)
Anybody near New Jersey or New Orleans interested in this sort of development?

I first became aware of Bitcoin in 2013, as a potential method for me to purchase LSD online.  I didn't have the guts to purchase, as I work in hospital nursing.   At that time I took Bitcoin for granted, I thought it was like attaching a photo to an email.   I was not aware of how it produces unique secure concensus as an immutable network.   As time went by I became aware of it gaining value, but I didn't know why.   I didn't know about halvings and limited supply.  
At this point I'm into it.   I like how a variety of signature technologies are evolving to increase the capability of Bitcoin.   I like the idea of money that is not controlled by a nation state.  I hope that Bitcoin in some way helps increase personal freedoms.  
Most people, nocoiners, are not interested in cryptocurrency.  It is difficult to even introduce the concept.

I believe if you are mining, effectively you are already running a full node, as miners have a full copy of the blockchain.  They are seeking the hash of the next block through mining.   I'm not 100% certain I'm correct, but it seems like this is how it works.

His book actually touchs upon some predetory practices of traditional mortgage lenders and banks along the lines of race. It also discusses a variety of business within the Bitcoin space, such as Bitcoin ATMs and BITT in the Caribbean.  It broadly touches on many subjects within the Bitcoin space, it is a good book.
It gets a bit enthusiastic at points in regards to calling upon the reader to adopt crypto.   In that it leans on some what emotional calls to action rather than very clearly outlining the cause and effect.    I'm not saying I would have done any better, just my impressions.
I'm sure his intent is to improve his circumstances, but I also believe Isaiah cares about Bitcoin.    There are human and systemic issues with race in the world, and I think it is valuable to have a voice from within the black community.
I was showing a black vender at a Farmers market how to set up a Bitcoin and receive a transaction in December 18.   A friend of hers was extremely skeptical of Bitcoin in that she thought it was another tool to be used against her by white America.   Before individuals dismiss that perspective, remember that if you have not lived as a black American, you really don't know what it is like.    Thus, a work covering Bitcoin from within the black community is valuable and good for Bitcoin.

You forge (mine) Bitcoin, by aggregating transactions into a block, validating they meet concensus rules, then hashing with a number that yields a hash of the block that meets the difficulty target.  Success in that endeavor will yield the next block on the chain and a block reward to be divided among the miners that provided the hashing power.

I purchased at 17400,  and I viewed it as placing a flag at an elevated point.  I figured it would fall,  but didn't know how much.   I didn't know what it would do,  if it went higher,  I wanted to go with it.   I never realized the significance of Bitcoin in terms of network, or the implications.  I was aware of bitcoin in 2013,  and I regretted not learning sooner.   I have down cost averaged, since then and my cost basis has improved.   I don't have any plans to exit,  and I'm continuing regular small buys with intent to accumulate.   I have my BTC divided on my Trezor and Samurai wallet.  I have helped 7 people set up their first wallets and send them their first BTC.   I'm not sure which of the frothing estimates for future price will be accurate,  but it seemed like to large of a phenomenon with large social implications to be ignored.
