For starting.....they probably don't go on reddit and advertise themselves as valuable target ?
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:45:18
Probably some people that get confused and were thinking they were buying another token or bought by a cat walking on a keyboard.....only logical explanation.

They were mining BCH for fun and promote their company.

Not sure....
Imagine you invest part of your saving in one altcoin that died... would you buy coins again or just tell your friend that investing in coins is very dangerous and they should think twice about it ?

no need to spam all thread (

one stupid question... I understand the price of food is going crazy. One day you need 10 fiat for your steak and the day after it is 20 fiat. Now I wonder if the use of bitcoin made the price stable ? I mean if they are lot of people waiting to buy their steak why would the situation be different ? One day it is 1 BTC and the next day it is 2 BTC because people are desperate and the price is link to the demand ?

Useless trolling ??

Still he has a point. 
and can we please avoid closing all discussion about alt-coins with "Sell you bitcoins and but XXX if you don t believe me".
I m going to sold some BTC to buy XRP just to try to make quick profit....because all my friend that want to buy some coins are currently telling me they find this perfect coin to buy "ripple" on coinmarket that is the future and still very cheap. They have no idea that is because it is centralized with the owner generating tone of coin to have such market cap.

I have a nano S and pretty happy about it. Never had Trezor so can not compare but in both case I think it is safer than the letting them online.

That's a long trip.... especially if he continue to invest 100$/week and BTC gain 200$/week. I made a quick graph on how much he would make in the next 10 years and he will probably never reach 10BTC
This was excel made but I would be happy to see a mathematical version to see if the suite ever converge to a value ;)

Probably Advance Machine Learning algo (powered by a quantum computer of course).
@_date: 2017-05-16 15:11:35
but intelligent people are a minority...More and more of my friend that want to buy some coins are currently telling me they find this perfect coin to buy "ripple" on coinmarket that seems to be the future and still very cheap. They have no idea that is because it is centralized with the owner generating tone of coin to have such market cap.
at then end....they will participate to the market growth and thus even attract more people

Oh god.....i whish I had similar question
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:49:31
Yes if they come with more than 10 000 $ (exactly like they are doing for BTC). For me they are just updating the law by adding BTC as real currency... good question would be "are they demanding the same for people entering with gold ??"
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:47:07
you know they can search your phone, right ?
and of course even if you think removing your app remove all trace of it....you're wrong
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:13:50
Make sense.... 
Bitcoin situation could be parallel with having money in an institution outside of US authority...like a bank account in EU. Guess what....such law exists for such asset.
you should have a look on FATCA ( which ensure that foreign bank institutions declare all US citizen asset to US government and is match against your FBAR ( declaration every year. 
This is probably a mandatory step if you want bitcoin to be fully accepted by the government. There will probably also have a law that will require all bitcoin transaction to be check against a white list before been accepted by any merchant and maybe a law that force US visitor to give their crypto info if they enter in the US like it is the case for social media info (
At this end it is fine as long as you declare it properly in time and pay taxes on possible benefit made from trading it.

I imagine 80% of them drop but 20% gain....and gain a lot and become the new bitcoin.

It's called Steganography " and to answer your question....yes if someone know it is a passphrase they will probably steal it. BTW... my private key is maybe in this message ;)
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:40:45
I think of a safe solution for you.... I will give you my public address so you can send me some coin so that you don t have to declare so much ;) otherwise I m not sure since it is unclear if you declare only if you have the key with you.
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:42:39
maybe the application on the phone that they can scan ( or maybe if you are a US citizen bu checking the main website that allow to sell/buy coin ( Failure to declare = jail.....would you take the risk ?
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:22:15
interesting POV. What do you think will happen to the Altcoin if an ETF is accepted soon in the future ?
@_date: 2017-06-02 01:27:59


that's a very good question, anybody know ?
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:08:57
Thx for sharing !

I would also mention the failure of traditional banks. See the last one this week:
In some coutry the bank are allowed to use the fund it have to avoid bankrupt... in other word that can just take your own money to save themselves (see  ). Nice no ?
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:35:29
Yes because if later you try to move money from this foreign bank account to the US it can be track. It's just a question of knowledge
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:29:43
still need to be declare to IRS so don t spend the 600$ but rather 300$ and keep 300$ for when you will have to pay the tax.
