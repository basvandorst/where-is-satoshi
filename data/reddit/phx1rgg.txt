I almost bought a million Dinars on Saturday from a friend that I have known at work for over 4 years. He was born in Iraq. Has 22 million Dinar in a SDB. Was going to do a swap for $840 in BTC. He is as curious about BTC as I am the Dinar. He thinks there is a great possibility this will go through. 8 on a scale of 10. Just like I think BTC will be the future of money. Pussed out at the last minute. I hate the Donald with a passion. He has tried to keep his word on many things that I don’t agree with. But, I can see him making this swap happen before he leaves office to make himself and his friends richer. Did I make a mistake or the right move?

I’m guessing this is on either Industrial, Highland, or Westwood Dr’s in Vegas. Im going on a scavenger hut on my day off Thursday to find this place.

I’m sure it will be “down for maintenance” for awhile. Or due to a bug, we have to suspend withdrawals at this time. Exchanges are like casinos. They only do what their supposed to do when it favors them. When things favor the player all of sudden the happy casino turns mean and ruthless.

Great post! Thank you!

Very nice display and great for adoption. We all need to be like you. On the funny/sad side, Please post the photo of the smashed glass and missing BTC when some dumbass thinks they hit the mother load.

I appraise cars every once and a while. It amazes me how Mercedes, BMW, etc. can sell these and their owners keep coming back year after year with the massive depreciation they take. It’s the definition of insanity. If I’m ever lucky enough to get crypto riches, the last thing I would do is waste that money on such a massive depreciating asset. And I sure as heck wouldn’t broadcast those riches either. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 06:44:24
Are you saying they can set up their own exchanges to bypass regulations? Are we going to see every tribe have their own exchange like they currently own casinos? If the US bans BTC could they be the only ones to sell it? How can somebody use their exchange while not living on Indian land? How would this affect a normal Joe crypto trader/investor?

It wasn’t a Senator. It was a congressman and his name is Brad Sherman from California. He is supported by the credit card industry. If you look at the entire hearing, you will find there were just as many that opposes his idea than back him. But, that doesn’t mean there won’t be a future fight. I suggest you call your state reps and senators and see what their stand is on BTC and crypto currencies. I’m getting no where with my reps from Nevada. After almost 4 weeks, I have received nothing back from my six members after being promised I would get some form of communication in 2-3 weeks. I will follow up next week again. This time I will ask when their next town hall is and voice my concerns. We have quite a few members from our local BTC meetups that will join me. If India bans BTC, that will give Sherman and his cronies some ammo to try and do it here. Don’t just sit around and think our wonderful government is going to help you get rich. There are powerful people that know BTC can destroy them. Get active and let your voice be heard!
Here is a link to the hearing over a month ago.

My understanding is Coinbase reports sales over 20K to the IRS. If that gain happened prior to 365 days and you cashed out under 365 it is at the high capital gains tax.

It is just amazing to see this post. This time last year I️ didn’t even know what a Bitcoin was. 
There was one guy at work talking about this who I️ thought was crazy. But, I️ loved his passion and listened. He has changed my life. 
I️ don’t know what the future holds for this year, but I️ hope it’s just as good. 
As we give thanks on Thursday, I️t probably wouldn’t hurt to find the person that got you involved in this craziness and say THANK YOU! 
Good luck to all!

Touch’e. If you spend that much time putting a presentation together, it would help to have as much in place so that folks take you serious. Just a little constructive criticism. No worries!

How he is not in the Trump cabinet amazes me. He would fit in so well. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:30:11
This isn’t the case. But, if you don’t think our friends in congress won’t use this FUD to use against crypto in the coming future, your wrong. Brad Sherman has already used this argument once in the house finance committee. If you hold a penny in crypto and you don’t know what your congressman/woman’s stance is on BTC or crypto, you are doing yourself a disservice. Every crypto holder should be calling their representatives, going to town halls, and voicing their feelings on crypto. There will be future millionaires and new campaign contributors in those T/H’s. They are not stupid enough not to see that. A whole new donor class if they listen. Don’t just sit there and think your safe. The US dollar is pegged to so much for this country. There is much at stake. BTC takes that away. The sky isn’t falling yet. Don’t let it happen. 
You can google your states congressional representatives and get their numbers. Hopefully I will see you at the next Dina Titus, Steve Horsford, Susie Lee town hall.
@_date: 2019-02-12 20:52:38
Not at all. I was so pissed about paying 38% CG that I decided to wait until I hit 365 days. As it turned out, it was stupid to hold. I could have cashed out paid 38% bought the dip and been a happy mofo. Now I’m just a bag holder waiting to strike IF it happens again. The old woulda-coulda-shoulda syndrome is what I deal with daily.

Ugh! You can only shake your head at these decisions. God help if us if there is another financial crises like 08. There isn’t enough room in the clown car to pick these guys up to get to whatever bigtop they need to go to when the dam breaks. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:17:44
Sorry to see this. No matter what country it occurs in. We think this won’t happen in the US. Ask your state congressional delegation what their stance is on crypto currency/BTC and see what happens. Called all six from Nevada twice and didn’t get an answer back from any of them via mail or e-mail. If I asked about the desert tortoises you bet my mailbox would have been full. Just sit back and do nothing and see what happens. Maxine Waters wants to punish Zuckerberg. Brad pig vomit Sherman from So Cal wants a ban all crypto. If you think it won’t happen here. You could be very wrong. Get active! Town halls are next for me my crypto friends!

I’m very surprised that the bank lobbyist aren’t in their ears 24/7 to squash it. Crypto will take down the powerful. I can’t believe how little opposition has occurred so far. Especially with our crooked system of government.

@_date: 2019-01-16 17:23:35
I agree with that thought. Another thought would be that the US could ban BTC if the Russians did that to skip sanctions. I have always wondered how there has been little pushback so far from governments and central banks from a tech that could bring them down. This would make it easy for them in the name of national security. I hope I’m wrong to think this. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 21:14:59
Thanks for posting this. Imagine if thousands of us did the same thing. The speculation piece of crypto is behind us. The only way we are going to see growth instead of up one week down the next, is projects being put out for actual use and getting the other 98% involved. I salute you! 
@_date: 2019-05-02 22:01:29
That would equate to 33,333 bitcoin =$1,000 USD
Now at 179,998,200 ($5400)
Now that is a return. Or, $660,000,000 at the all time high of $20K.

You are correct. He didn’t appear to have many friends today either. But, don’t underestimate our little creepy friend. There are very powerful people with lots of donation money behind him and possibly others.

Wouldn’t that be a hoot that the Winklevoss twins are are in the same arena with him without knowing it and he would stick it to them twice? He would have created 2 of the greatest tech inventions in human history. Very unlikely that this is a possibility. But, the twins would have to say FML if true.

With this market being so easily manipulated, I can’t imagine these WallStreet guys, funds, bankers, etc. not tanking the market one more time to get it as low as they can, shake out the last of the weak hands, and then go all in. We have always seen summer drops of 30-40 percent (usually before a holiday weekend, especially in 2016 &amp; 2017) the last four years. I expect another dump and then Pluto after that.
@_date: 2019-05-24 15:59:53
It didn’t. If it was going to dump, it would have happened by now. I was WRONG! Not enough volume for it to happen over the weekend. Just going off off past experiences.

@_date: 2019-05-10 01:22:50
I posted this in another thread. 
I think this is way bigger than what anybody has posted so far. What he said is correct. To the 2% that knows this space, we laugh and call Sherman an idiot. The other 98% won’t look at it that way. We have to keep a close eye on this. Where is the complete video? What was the outcome of today’s meeting? When is the next hearing? When will this be voted on? 
Everybody in crypto knows this fight will happen sooner or later. It might be at our door right now. We need to educate ourselves and organize quickly. Yes, the genie is out of the bottle. But, it doesn’t mean he can’t get the crap kicked out of him from the worlds biggest bully.
@_date: 2019-05-15 05:00:30
If you believe in what your investing in then go for it. Having a $200 a month payment for having the slice of a dream is well worth it. I sure wish you would have had this same thought 6 months ago. I took a loan out 3 years ago for crypto and have not regretted it once. I’m sure I wouldn’t be posting this if I took the loan out in January of 18. Timing sometimes is very important. Might want to wait a while for a correction than jumping in at highest point in a while. Summer corrections always happen in a upward moving market. You will see.

I suggest everyone that reads this post contact their Senators &amp; Representatives (google congressional representatives and then your state to get their numbers) and ask them what their stance is on BTC &amp; cryptocurrencies and then tell them what your stance is. This fight is only beginning and we have very little lobbying power. Everyone must do their part to fight/protect their investments. I’m sure Mr. Sherman isn’t the only one that feels this way.

PS: I suggest you watch the 2 hour hearing and realize that it isn’t really about crypto. It’s 5 minutes of Brad on his lobby soapbox at minute 58. I wish I would have seen this before freaking out. That is on me. 
@_date: 2019-05-06 01:49:50
You are correct. The more quiet we are. The harder folks work on their projects. The better off we will be. One day it will just happen and by then it’s too late. They wont be able stop it. We strike fear in them now, then they will throw up their powerful walls.
@_date: 2019-05-14 05:21:45
Couldn’t agree more. There is much at stake and there is massive amounts of power that don’t want this to succeed. If you think this will be easy, your kidding yourself. This should be discussed constantly in our forums.  We should know the position of every Senator and representative in Congress. Our lobbying power is minuscule next to the banking lobby.
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:23:45
Only Catherine Masto said currently no stance. The 5 others said they will get back with me via e-mail or regular mail. 4 days later, no e-mail response. Once they do, I will be finding out when they are in their district and showing up at their town halls.
@_date: 2019-05-11 20:50:30
I must say, he was right in what he said. At least he was honest. After I got done calling him a stupid MFer for wanting to ban it, I realized something very important. We are not a joke or Ponzi scheme anymore. The entire crypto space was legitimized by his comments.
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:58:20
In watching that hearing, there are representatives that are pro crypto too. They need to be praised for their efforts. The ones that have their hands in the banks cookie jars need to be voted out. Who is on what side? There are 535 members of Congress, We need to have a list and get busy.
@_date: 2019-05-04 21:22:16

It’s about to be a holiday weekend. Look at how the market reacted during summer holiday weekends in 2016-2017 when the markets were moving. I don’t know squadush about what he is talking about, but I agree some whales are about to take some profit in the next 24 hours.
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:29:04
I agree totally. My first reaction was he is still an asshole. Then I thought, he just legitimized us. Win/Win for now. But it’s not over yet.
@_date: 2019-05-06 00:04:54
If you had major investments and involvements in US banks, I think you would do the same. Everybody says he is just an old man that knows nothing about the tech. I think he is one of the smartest men out there that can clearly see the writing on the wall and is dragging this out as long as he possibly can. I’m very surprised there are not hundreds more in the banking industry yelling gambling/fraud every second of everyday.
@_date: 2019-05-14 05:09:54
I called the offices of two senators and 4 representatives today in Nevada to ask what their stance was on BTC and cryptocurrencies. I will be getting responses back in a week or two. After what Brad Sherman did last week, I need to know what team my representatives are on. I strongly suggest you do the same and tell them how important it is to you and that you have many friends. This fight for adoption is far from over. Get active and be involved.
