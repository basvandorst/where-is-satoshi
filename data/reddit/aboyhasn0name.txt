IMO the fees large US banks charge are dicking people over. High interest rates, monthly fees, overdraft fees, wire fees, ATM fees..this is on top of what they make by investing the money we loan them interest free (money on deposit).

oh yes, it's very nice.

That was great. Reminded me of a Dogecoin video made in a similar theme.

I wish that little touchscreen on the left with the BTC logo on it was more in frame. We all know what a fait cc terminal looks like.

Anyone can fork the bitcoin chain, but without the massive support of miners and their hashing power that secures the network, it doesn't mean anything. The original bitcoin chain will continue on. Without consensus of over half the miners, you can't just fork to a new chain with new rules.


Except this isn't possible with bitcoin. You can't just copy-paste a bitcoin and reproduce it endlessly.

Just click on balances at that point..did the same thing to me.

Exactly. Everything is set up to be extremely difficult to function without using a bank. Those that can't obtain bank accounts for whatever reason live at a severe disadvantage. In the US, checks are still a thing (unfortunately) and you can have your salary paid by check, but then you have to find a place to exchange your check for cash. They'll often have hefty fees for this service, eating into your salary.

I sure thought I had read this all before.


Yes, please cite your source. Otherwise it looks like you're trying to pass off someone else's work as your own.

If you aren't forced to use banks, you aren't forced to answer their questions. Bitcoin provides an opportunity to transact without banks as a middleman.

Recently saw a piece how Bank of America was phasing out their free checking account and charging a $12 monthly fee if you didn't maintain a balance of at least $250 or have direct deposit from your employer.

I feel like this could help take some of the technical complexity out of it: [ but the range isn't there.

Completely decentralized immutable public ledger, a permanent record that can't be altered and will survive much longer than any centralized bank database. I agree, this is one of the most important and amazing inventions of our time.

Exactly. Housing bubble of 2008 wasn't even that long ago.

This has been my experience as well. No more "free money". Also the investment choices are not ones I would ever pick, I don't care for the inflexibility.

The Federal Reserve isn't even a government agency! Learning this blew my mind.

I would get into bitcoin for the technology and what benefits it can bring our society, not the idea of making a lot of money.

Oh, good point. I missed that it was receive-only.

It feels like they tried to simplify the interface too much. I didn't even expect a confirmation popup when buying Bitcoin since there isn't a confirmation for withdrawing cash.

I like Gitea (and Gogs, although slightly less than Gitea..), although git is distributed by design only needing HTTP or SSH to share a repo.
@_date: 2019-11-01 16:26:31


I've seen some interesting work on this front, referred to as Web3 (or Web 3.0) and some interesting projects like IPFS, MaidSafe, Blockstack, Filecoin.
@_date: 2019-11-04 16:57:45


But then we'd need a transparent ledger that couldn't be manipulated, could be publicly accessed by anyone, durable enough to survive so probably decentralized... wait.

If you really absolutely must store your funds in a custodial wallet, look at BitGo. They're multi-signature, been around since 2013, trusted by large crypto companies and insured.
EDIT: Well, they started charging a 0.25% withdraw fee. Consider a Ledger hardware wallet: [
@_date: 2019-11-07 17:04:17
They have some heavy KYC/AML to enable withdraws..they asked for my profession, company name of employer, how I primarily earn income, purpose of buying/selling Bitcoin (investing, trading, mining, etc), copy of drivers license and selfie.

How do you pay your living expenses (housing, food, insurance, other bills) with bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-10-26 18:57:14


Yeah, don't do that.
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:10:37
Wikipedia says they shut down in 2008 and reached their peak in 2006, still makes me feel old though! Haha
@_date: 2019-04-09 17:24:40
I had a bad run-in with the failed e-Gold, so when I first heard about BTC I wasn't interested. By the time I caught up, it was the end of 2013 and $1k per coin seemed outrageous. Nowadays $1k/coin seems cheap.
@_date: 2019-12-06 03:12:50
Log into Coinbase Pro and deposit the Bitcoin you bought. Then withdraw it from Coinbase Pro to your Ledger wallet. That will save you any fees for withdrawing.

Not exactly. If you trade Bitcoin for another crypto, that is a taxable event. If you use Bitcoin to buy something, that is also a taxable event. If you bought Bitcoin and just held it, then you're fine. For now.
