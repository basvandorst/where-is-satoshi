Be sure to let us know when you have Bitpay or Coinbase set up, I'd love to be able to buy Kratom in btc.

Decentralization = lots of talking to each other.  Get used to it.

Good man.  I bought at $6 and held firm when it crashed to $2, then recovered partially and hovered around $5 for almost a year.  Worked out pretty well for me!

Local trades.  As in, you send btc directly to a buyer after receiving cash in hand.  I'm assuming you are referring to internet trades with escrow, different animal.

Regarding your first question, I found a great resource online for keeping tabs on bitcoin.  It's called reddit!  Just go to  and read the links on the first page to get the latest.
Regarding your second question, I'd recommend a slightly less obscure site that you may have used before -

American here, I use campbx and localbitcoins.  Campbx = low prices for buying, localbitcoins = high prices for selling.
If I was buying large quantities or swing trading, I would have registered with bitstamp.

I've found that people who are brand new to Bitcoin will assume that you're using the transaction service with the codes and the fee.  And veterans will assume that you're going to pay them directly.  It's a pain in the ass.  But the btc seller can send coins to localbitcoins in advance, then transfer them directly back out to any external address from the online wallet if the btc buyer wants to be paid directly.  That way the btc seller doesn't have to offer in advance to go outside of escrow, which can seem sketchy to noobs.  It's funny, they have a completely inverted sense of risk because they're so used to having other people protect their money.

It didn't fail.  It demonstrated that encampments are a much more effective form of assembly than marches and demonstrations when it comes to galvanizing public discourse.  It's a very effective tactic, different in kind from bitcoin but not mutually exclusive.  Maybe the two will come together at some point, when people set up a mesh network in a future encampment that can sustain bitcoin commerce.
