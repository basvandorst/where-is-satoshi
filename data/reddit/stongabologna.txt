I agree there might be "better" ways to go about this, but the guy's mom needed a car, and he wants her to be comfortable, safe, and happy.

This is all true through the lens of fiscal responsibility.  It's also important to remember that maybe the guy just wants to be really comfortable on his commute, maybe he believes ethically that he should cut down his emissions.  
That being said, I don't think I would ever buy an expensive brand new car unless I came into $5M USD or more.

Really not the best advice.

I had a friend that had something like $75k in Tiffany lamps in his house, if that counts for anything.  The guy's net worth is probably in the single digit millions.

My friend used to do this when crypto was just getting hot back in maybe 2016.  He set up a "bitcoin" generator where you had to send him a small amount and he would send a large amount back.  The idea was to get enough people to leave comments saying that it worked and then he was going to keep whatever people sent him after that.

While homeless, you will have plenty of time for that.
