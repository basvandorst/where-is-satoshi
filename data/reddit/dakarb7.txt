Capital one 360 has been a bro to me with regards to bitcoin transactions for years.  Even multiple in a day.

Get em hooked and jack the price up

Bitcoin has taught me how to handle Tesla’s stock drop today.

I own 8% of a bitcoin and i'm rooting for it to stay down until i can afford more.  I'm selfish.

Sp500 has three rate cuts already priced in since the worry over the China trade war.  Investors have been riding this pumped up market that expects a rate cut and don’t want to lose their gains.  Politicians currently in office get to say how well the market has been doing under them and all this puts pressure on the fed (who said a week ago that they don’t really think rate cuts are necessary yet) to cut rates.

so just import keys into each one separately and I will have both?

that was it, i knew it was a stupid mistake, thanks.

I was not able to initiate it, i received "insufficient funds".
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:04:14
Yeah, haven’t seen these prices since this morning.  Big crash, Bitcoin is doomed.

The fee for selling on Coinbase is way higher, just sell on GDAX and transfer to your bank.

Meaning an item sold under $750 does not require signature confirmation to prove delivery.  This is a good thing, if you've ever sold on amazon, delivery confirmation proves absolutely nothing and without signature confirmation the buyer can say they never got the item and you will lose every time.
Now, the ambiguous wording about how they can limit funds withdrawals as they deem necessary is a little worrisome.
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:58:45
All they do is send you books and have you take a test.

Whether canned or not it still roughly translates into, "We don't give a fuck, go away."
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:05:16
On the contrary...you should buy more.

Nice, expect my repeated patronage.  You should sell invicta.

I won't hurl expletives like everyone else i just have one thing to say that i hope makes you think:
If you truly believe in the future of bitcoin, you must realize that you need to go away.  You need to fade into obscurity and move on with your life.  If you continue to make an attempt to bring back mt. gox in any capacity, you will only continue to deal blows to the public's confidence in cryptocurrencies altogether.  Whether you had good intentions or not, its over now, you have failed, and your name is mud.  Cut your losses and move on and i assure you no matter how angry anyone is at you now, eventually they will move on as well.  Both parties end up wiser in the long run.

Thanks for the review, ive been eyeing a watch they have for sale and was waiting to hear about how the process went.

What does HODL stand for?  Is it just a silly way of saying hold?
@_date: 2019-06-04 22:47:30
Narrowly missed triggering my limit buy at that level
@_date: 2019-06-04 23:01:47
What’s confusing?  You set how much to buy and at what price you want to pay and if the price hits your limit, you buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-29 23:21:36
Anybody think a strategy like a daily dca buy accompanied with a set amount depending on percentage drop?  So for example if I put $10 a day but also put in $100 on a 10% drop, $200 on a 20% drop, etc.  would this have any benefit over just simply dca?
@_date: 2019-10-25 22:42:16
Then bitcoin will never become mainstream.  If that scenario plays out, the investors will eventually want to cash out, causing the price to crash and al those FOMO buyers will sell at a loss and be forever adverse to anything crypto.  Slow and steady wins the race.

I've lost 3.5 BTC to gambling and i'm done, the first 3 were back when BTC was $100, i had them gambled all the way up to 5 BTC, it hurt and i gave up on bitcoin totally.  The last half was recently when BTC was over $1000, that hurt.  I've given up on gambling and will never deposit the slightest amount into a BTC gambling address because i know i will not be responsible.  Switch to holding BTC it will be far more profitable in the long run.
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:10:24
I'm just hoping for the day that they do, i'll buy them all, wake up on the moon.
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:45:15
They gave me 950 this morning which is exactly what I cashed out at, even though the value is 100$ less today than when I cashed out.  Coinbase usually has good customer service, you should contact them.

Tim Cook is pissed off he didn't get on board sooner.

Its a start, but if you get burnt there is still no recourse.
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:30:35
So basically I'm being charged $40 per BTC at current rate.  What incentive do I have again?
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:09:14
I cashed out earlier in the week and received exactly what was promised in the box I pressed submit, got it exactly when promised as well.
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:32:55
 Payday is tomorrow in the USA so buy now or regret it later.

I laughed for a good 30 seconds.  Funniest part is that BTC-e is really on the screen.

It is possible your wireless carrier blocks the call.  I know my carrier blocks the text, but the call always goes through.

What's funnier is that people believe these altcoins have independent value when in fact their value is directly tied to that of Bitcoin.

You need to verify a credit card for instant buy now.

I'm pissed off for you.  The intelligence level in this country is staggeringly low and for this to happen sends me through the roof.  Your writing is probably head and shoulders above the typical 8th grader anyway.  Also get your parents to have a talk with the principal and contact your local news (they'll eat it up, plus bitcoin gets some publicity).
