Sounds like your not very good at adapting your strategies to changing variables?  This is a very dynamic market, your strategies need to be dynamic.

I'm going to put as much effort as you did into searching past posts on the subject, someone asks this question nearly every day so you obviously didn't try hard.
The answer to your question is: a place that sells Bitcoin

This is easily one of Jay's best one liners.  A+ reference.

Within 99.999% certainty, yes this is a scam.
The way the scam goes is, you sign up on their website, it shows your account having 0.057BTC, but then when you try to withdraw it, an error will pop up and say you need a minimum of 0.075 BTC to transfer out of your account (or some other amount), and that you should send the difference in BTC to your account so you can withdraw.
Once you transfer whatever the difference is into your 'account' on their 'website', you will then either get a different message when trying to withdraw (some other message that tries to get you to send more BTC, usually), or it just repeats the old error message.
You'll never be able to withdraw anything, and you will have lost whatever you sent to try and get to the 'withdraw' limit.
No I have not fallen for this myself, but I've seen a ton of people post about it on here.

I always find it you see some outlandish price claim for the future, if you divide that price by 10, it starts to sounds reasonable/believable.  25k by 2021, 180k by 2024, etc.

That said though, no harm in going to a public computer (library, etc) and try to claim it, so long as you don't send any personal information or bitcoin.
