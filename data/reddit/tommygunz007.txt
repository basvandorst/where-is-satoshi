Just understand that when the market crashes, people get scared and sell off ALL their investments. So, if the market has a massive crash, Bitcoin will also see a huge sell off.
@_date: 2019-07-30 20:50:33
Hrm... so, basically, I would own digital gold, that isn't digital, and stored in a legitimate physical wallet, basically like a gold bar? Not trying to be an ass (well maybe a little) but why doesn't someone just sell hard wallets that are like fiat? Like, buy a wallet with 1k in it, and then buy several wallets, making them basically thousand dollar bills, or basically gold bars.

@_date: 2018-09-24 01:08:07
 I personally believe that bitcoin is dead.  The big spike to 19 K is because it was the hot new buzz on the street. Now its old news and is not interesting like it once was. As usual all the big movers and shakers bought in and now control it like everything else in the world. And if the economy or banks collapse, the first thing that people will sell is Bitcoin and it too, will crash allowing the rich to buy it all up and own it all again. Just like Gold, it too loses value when global economies tank.

Again, I fail to understand how if my rent is $1400 FIAT, and my paycheck is $1400 FIAT, that the 'value' of anything is changing. I get if the currency relative to monies abroad changes, but how would it change on the local level? How would the layperson, say me, be affected by the worsening of the dollar relative to my rent paying? At the end of the day, paying rent is the number one thing I have to do. The value of the dollar drops all the time in America but mostly because of the fact that we are overpopulated and so it's a hirer's market. People that once made $65,000/year now make $35,000 per year because 'everyone' has a masters degree and 'everyone' has loans they are desperate to pay so because people are desperate, businesses can prey on those who need a job and offer them half as much and actually get someone educated to do the job. So in that sense, the value of the dollar is definitely much less as we overpopulate. 
So, (and I am not being a jerk here) can you honestly explain, using past history of the United States, where the value of the dollar relative to say, the GBP or any other worldwide currency, fell very low to where BTC would have helped? Now, I definitely get what would happen if there was a worldwide crash. I would still have to pay rent, but the depression would mean I would get fired/laid off of work, and without a job, I would have to sell my BTC at a loss (which would crash BTC's prices too). However, the physical dollars in my lease remain but my earning potential would vastly drop as there would be millions of unemployed and only those with the FIAT would have power to hire. People with BTC would most likely sell to get FIAT to pay rents. 
So, please, educate me, as I am fascinated by how this is supposed to actually work. I watch a lot of youtube videos that talk about Venezuela or Zimbabwe. I understand what could happen, but if I lived in Venezuela, the money I put into BTC is still based on a US dollar value, or some other FIAT currency. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 23:29:39
Everyone keeps on throwing this 'catastrophic' scenario around in which the dollar crashes. I am not sure why everyone keeps watching the same video, but here is my personal opinion on the subject.
When we have had 'runs' on the banks, and equally 'catastrophic weather and destruction' it leaves people with the same basic problem. No FIAT currency. In Puerto Rico, they had no cash. Banks were closed or couldn't help. In America, banks have to have less than 10% of the cash on hand in their vaults, which means, when the power goes out, so does your money. When there is a run on the banks for FIAT, they run out. 
Now, let's say you are in Puerto Rico, and you have Gold bars, and Bitcoin. You desperately need FIAT Cash for milk for your baby, and the landlord wants his/her money for the mortgage and you haven't been working. So, the first thing you do is try and sell your gold, or sell your bitcoin. It's not the reverse. People don't say 'Hey, I am about to go bankrupt, I better put all my money into Bitcoin'. If there is a massive hurricane coming, you can bet people will run to the banks to get FIAT, not put all their money into BTC. They will sell sell sell their BTC to pay their mortgage, and the currency will crash.
Now let's take a different scenario, one in which there IS power in the USA, and there IS internet, and there IS a way to pay for goods and services with Bitcoin. Given that you are getting paid $40k/year regardless of what is happening, in what scenario would you suddenly have NO money, and a need to pay for things in Bitcoin? This is the scenario that makes no sense to me. I get the 'theory' of what the videos on YouTube propose, a hypothetical in which the dollar becomes useless like Venezuelan currency or Zimbabwae currency. But even in that situation, there becomes a new FIAT standard. Maybe it's the Japanese Yen. Point is, suddenly the entire world won't switch to a digital standard, it will always be a FIAT standard, because that's what the loans are borrowed against, and debt is managed against. And no matter where you are in the world, as long as there is a FIAT standard that converts from FIAT to Digital BTC, you will have to somehow convert back for the majority of vendors at a fee, making it more of a hassle for most people.

The internet is, in fact, dead. I remember when a trillion dollars was just haphazardly thrown at anyone who could write HTML. Anyone who merely mentioned the word 'internet' got paid 90k and a swank office somewhere. Businessmen threw tons of money to gain marketshare of something they didn't even understand.
Now, it's near impossible to get a good internet job unless it's google, apple, or a mere handful of companies. There was a time when like every company in existence purchased domains with no understanding of what a domain was or how it could make money. 
There was a time like this with Bitcoin, in which everyone jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon thinking it would change the world. 
Just like PayPal figured out, it's very hard to give 'free' banking transactions to people and run a business. CashApp has a pretty good model in which you pay a small fee if you have their debit card, but free otherwise. Eventually, Bitcoin transactions will do one of two things. One is to implement a percent transaction fee, just like banks do, and the other is that if the fee is very low, eventually banks will just match it. Banks will never go away, and Bitcoin will never 'crush' banks. 
Bitcoin is NOT like the internet, but rather like gold. Whenever there is economic crisis, the first thing people do is actually SELL their investments, including gold to pay their mortgage. The same will happen with Bitcoin. Ask any low level person on Reddit. There are some who the moment they have a financial situation, cash out their Bitcoin, driving the price down. That's about 60% of the people who own Bitcoin. People with mortgages, and student loans - the two things that would force them to sell Bitcoin at a loss to pay. 
The internet is not what it once was, as Amazon, eBay, Netflix, and a handful of others really dominate. The internet was supposed to be a way for 'everyone' to have a voice. We have found that there are a lot of 'fake' voices out there, and the internet is actually both good and bad. 
So, in many ways, the internet is not the free, open, internet it once was. Just as Bitcoin as a 'free, open, currency' it will not be.
@_date: 2018-05-26 15:25:04
Ask Puerto Rico, who went months without power. Ask New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy. Ask me after I didn't pay my phone bill. In all cases, no power means no buying/spending power for goods. FIAT always has a place, BTC will never replace that. Because of that reason, gold, or the currency of the stable government, will be most important.

Just so I understand this.....
1. Everyone says we NEED an independent currency that is hidden from governments and can have all sorts of nefarious exchanges. Then, when people get scammed, they cry that they NEED some kind of oversight.
2. Then everyone says they want banks and other vendors to handle BTC for said transactions, again without any oversight at least until they get scammed.
3. Then the investors step in, and see a whole bunch of scamming and say that they are not investing unless there is banking rules and oversight applied.
4. Investors say the only way it will get adopted by vendors and banks both is to have it regulated, by banks and financial laws, and thus, we are essentially back to square one, where we should just use FIAT.

well the problem is people will want 'safe transactions' which means that people who help with the transactions need a staff of people who need to get paid, so that means that fees need to be higher, and of course there are constant threats of being hacked, which means there is insurance, and even more security experts which means that even higher fees will be added.

I have to disagree. 
I first heard about Bitcoin 3 or 4 years ago, and I tried to buy from a bitcoin ATM and couldn't figure it out, and so I didn't buy. I now regret it. 
Every single day EVERY business report mentions Bitcoin. Every stock, every money show dealing with trading, mentions bitcoin. Every reasonably educated person with access to the internet who is over 25 has probably at least once heard of the word bitcoin.
I think we are in the 'Latecomers' period. The buzz is over, and now it's like Apple Pay. It's going to be adopted by a select few, but because there are so many alt coins, the value as a payment system is diminished. Also, why not Ethereum? Like, why does Bitcoin HAVE to be the one the world adopts? The reality is there is no reason. It could be Ethereum over BTC. Or Litecoin. 
There was an article yesterday about PayPal. Initially, it was free, but that was an unsustainable business model. That's what will happen with bitcoin. People have to make money. Banks and people attached to it have to make money. 
So I think we are in the late adoption stage and that it's burned fast and bright.

Just so I understand, Starbucks has to pay it's rent and bills in fiat, so it is going to use an intermediary to take payments as an exchange. Exchanges rely on fees, so basically, a $5 latte is (for argument's sake) 5btc PLUS some kind of fee which protects starbucks from an instantaneous crash. Like, I buy a 5 btc latte and a second later, it either booms or busts. Starbucks needs some kind of insurance, or instantaneous exchange. Insurance would be a fee of 3%, or instantaneous exchange to fiat would also be a fee added. 
The hurdle isn't that people won't accept bitcoin, it's that it's not native to how they pay their rent. If their rent is 10,000 a month in fiat, and the cost of bitcoin fluctuates, it could really burn their bottom line if they don't immediately exchange it, so a $5 latte will cost the consumer 5 btc + the fee. (assuming it's 1-1)

The mob and criminals, under the mask of corporations, will own and run governments. It doesn't matter if banks open or close, coins open or close, They will still have the power. The people will NEVER have the power. It's like the MIT Blackjack kids in vegas. They didn't get barred for _cheating_ they got barred for _winning_. That's my point. If suddenly there is a loss of power due to bitcoin, the laws will change and a smear campaign will go against it, making it the coin of drug lords. Remember, bitcoin has no backing, and no money and therefore no ability to promote itself. There is no government to produce pamphlets or anything else. On the other hand, the US could rename it the 'coin of terror' and suddenly laws would spring up because the mob and criminals can't control it. That's my point in all of this. It doesn't matter what you or the people want, it only matters what those in power want.

So, countries need money to function.
They have two options:
1. Tax people

I am a hater of the bullshit believers of fantasy currencies and nonsense that people spew here. The reality is that Bitcoin is a great secure middleman, like basically the ACH, the exchange. We start in fiat, end in fiat, and use Bitcoin/Block Chain to provide a secure way to transfer from one to the other overseas. Regardless of what your fiat starts in or finishes in, Bitcoin is the price we trade at, just as the same as the foreign exchange, except the foreign exchange of bitcoin is rigged by places like Gemini and other exchanges. 
@_date: 2019-03-31 17:03:34
It is the world's first global currency, but really there never was a need for one, and there still isn't. We have exchanges that before went USA Fiat - Yen Fiat. Now, people go USA Fiat - BTC - Yen Fiat. There isn't a real need for the extra step. Plus, it can be shorted, inflated, and scammed just like everything else. There is nothing to prevent the exchanges from having a meeting like the mob used to do (or Barclays) and gently nudge the prices upward. Computers can be manipulated. Barclays rigged the Libor and got caught. Just seems extra and we don't really need it.
@_date: 2019-03-16 15:03:34

Uh telnet was around. I wouldn't necessarily say that telnet was 'the internet', as in my mind, the internet officially happened when it became a graphic based multimedia experience, which would be somewhere in the HoTMetaL days of the 1994 ish time period. It grew in about 4 years to be more or less the web we see today. There is no rush for people to adopt bitcoin because at the start end, and the finish end, it's still fiat, even if it's bitcoin in the middle. Bitcoin only replaces the middleman, but the end to end is still fiat. The reason it's fiat is because governments are still in power. Without fiat, a government can't maintain control of it's people.

Can you explain the difference between 'inflation' and 'business inflation'? In the case of business inflation, bitcoin won't help. If the two are identical, then the bitcoin argument is total bullshit.
For example:
McDonalds accepts Bitcoin. Today, a BigMac is let's say 4 bitcoin. Next year, the price will go up to 5 bitcoin because the cost of burger meat will go up, as will the cost of buns, as will the cost of everything because all the intermediary businesses need more profits. The price of a BigMac will keep going up, wether you pay in Bitcoin or Fiat. Bitcoin will equally inflate as it's part of the global exchange, meaning that whatever is the 'coin of power' will trade (in theory) at the equal fixed rate of the time. Say $1 = $1btc. In theory, the price of a cheeseburger will go up from $4 to $5, and the price of a bitcoin cheeseburger will also go up from $4 to $5. However, what we want to have happen, is that the price of Bitcoin, to go up more, so that 1 Bitcoin equals $2, at a rate where the increase of the price of bitcoin, or 'devaluation' of the USD is such that the costs equal out. However, I have to think because bitcoin trades on the global currency market, that it's unlikely that it will happen in this way.

You might be missing the point. They don't have to _remove_ it per se, they just need to 'contain it'. Nobody cares if you have 0.0001 of the power. It's like Pirate Bay or silk road.

This is a great idea. It's as if there should be some big giant conglomerate with a marketing budget that could advertise this coin... but in order to have such flyers, there needs to be a way to generate money from this. Maybe we add a tiny, 3% fee to all transactions on the vendor side, you know, so we can pay the graphic designer, the printer, and everyone else involved? What? Sounds like Paypal? There you go. That's another reason why Bitcoin will not go far.
@_date: 2019-03-31 16:57:42
First off, thank you for your reply. I have owned and sold bitcoin and basically broke even. It's very hard to sift through what is factual, and what is hypothetical. So, let me try and break down many of the arguments I see.
1. Bitcoin is essentially traded every day through exchanges. It's bought and sold, and it's perceived value changes based on the pyramid scheme desire (get my friend to buy some so I make more money) and it also hypothetically changes when the US prints more money. The issue I have with this, is that exchanges inflate/deflate/alter their perceived values all the time. Barclays got busted rigging the Libor rates. Rich people can buy/sell/short Bitcoin as well, making it (on the surface) no different than a country on the exchange called Bitcoin with it's own gold-backed currency. The value of said currency as it relates to other countries, can be artificially modified. Also, the exchanges can price fix in that they can artificially inflate illegally if they so desire. This means, at it's outset, it's no different than anything else out there currency wise.
2. Countries CAN'T have bitcoin as their sole currency. Countries need fiat to generate a system of wealth and a way to tax people. Bitcoin goes out of it's way to do both of those. We are in an economic crisis right now due to sales taxes not being paid, and if we continue, there could very well be a problem with people buying overseas without paying a VAT. So, if say, Venezuela became a bitcoin country, how would it generate wealth? How would it tax people based on Bitcoin? It needs fiat of some kind, and as long as countries have a fiat, rents will be due in fiat, contracts will be written in fiat, and banks will be in fiat, meaning that Bitcoin becomes an 'extra un-needed step' if the end result is paying the government backed banks their fiat. 
3. overseas payments. I keep hearing how easy it is to buy stuff overseas with Bitcoin because it's legit and can't be stolen. This is by far an amazing thing to have, and is in fact, one of the great things I love about bitcoin. However, they also have to switch back to fiat via an exchange, and, at least in the US, there isn't a big rush to buy viagra or mail order brides from China. It's a very very small market for the consumer end. B2B sure. B2C? Not so much.
4. Transaction fees. Here in the USA, everyone keeps on saying 'oh, but you will save on transaction fees'. What people don't get is there is a reason it's 3%. It could easily be zero, but then merchant card processors would be bankrupt. The 3% covers things like fraud, accidently getting scammed, insurance, and the staff to handle things if something goes wrong. I guarantee that hypothetically, if payment processors all started taking bitcoin around the USA, that over time, that small fee would eventually go up to about 2%, and then MasterCard and Visa would lower theirs to 2%. It would definitely help initially in the competition, but banks always win, so it would go up to 3% shortly thereafter, getting you a net sum of zero.
5. The theory of Global Collapse. This is the one that I keep seeing that is the most frustrating. Everyone here in this sub seems to think that if the global economies collapse tomorrow, that miraculously the electricity and internet will make it through enough for people to buy and sell with bitcoin. I live in a place that was affected by hurricane sandy, and when we had no power for 7 days, it was cash only. No digital, no credit, no nothing. If you aint' got cash, you ain't eating. Some of us had power and cell phones, some didnt. Also, there was so much traffic on the cell towers, that you couldn't even process something over the cell internet anyways. You were dead in the water. Fiat or starve. I think if Puerto Rico. You think after the hurricane they were thinking about bitcoin? Nope. If a country collapses like Venezuela, bitcoin won't really help. It might be a good place to store your value, that is true, like stocks/bonds/investments, but you also could have had US Currency in place of bitcoin to store your wealth in (as opposed to Venezuela dollar). So, this doomsday prophecy, I am not so sure I believe it will work.

I am not so sure.
As long as my 20 year lease for my business is in fiat, that means for the next 20 years, I have to pay in fiat. So, whatever currency I get paid in, I have to convert it (for a fee) back into fiat to pay the note. This creates a real problem for adoption. This means it can never fully replace existing currencies if, say, 50% of your net income has to remain in fiat to pay your mortgage and student loans. If you could concievably get 100% pay in bitcoin, and at least 75% of your bills could be paid in bitcoin, then yes, there is a need for this. Right now, there isn't. There is no need for me to use bitcoin. None. No benefit to me (besides 'sticking it to the man' whatever that means). If I were to buy something right now from china, I can use paypal. I don't need to wait two weeks for my gemini account to go through and learn how to send and have a secure wallet or anything else. I just paypal or use my credit card, which if I pay on time, has zero interest and tons of insurance perks. 
All of the stuff people in this sub talk about are all theories based on white papers. On paper, it's accurate. In reality, it has little or no sticking power. It's like fanny packs. Fanny packs are freaking amazing. Every man and woman should have a fanny pack. They hold just about everything and were great but they had no sticking power. That's the same with bitcoin. After the last boom and bust, it now has no stick. It's the 'thing people use to buy drugs from China'. It's traced in the USA, because everything online is. Every banking transaction, every purchase through Gemini or any other exchange. In fact there was one guy who wrote an article for .. wired? Where he said how hard it is to buy giftcards with cash, then go buy a laptop with gift cards, then go to the library to set up the laptop to the internet, to then open a secure wallet overseas, but even then, the second you transfer any us dollars anywhere, it's tracked. So you can get relatively far at being anon still, but there will come a time where you will slip up and connect to your home wifi, thereby linking that laptop to your geographic location, and based on algorithims, can link that laptop and bitcoin transactions to your home, and possibly you.

Time for my weekly Q&amp;A to help me understand Bitcoin.
If you say 'Clearly you don't understand bitcoin sheesh' and that's your only response, don't waste either of our time. 
So, here it goes. 
Bitcoin is a closed system. That means, that if everyone in the world converts, and ALL FIAT everywhere becomes bitcoin, it's essentially like living on an island. Let's call this Island, Jurassic Park. 
PART I:
Now, on Jurassic Park, people on one side of the island, make $1 per hour, on the other, $5 per hour. I am using $ but assume it's BTC. Now, people making $1 are mad, so they get a little pissy, and want more. People making $5 say that the cost of living where they live means they NEED $5 per hour. What happens over time in this situation? Does it eventually all even out, where a labor hour is a labor hour, and so the richest paid countries will fall into the sea, and the poorest countries will suddenly make a lot more money? Or, on Jurassic Park, over time, everyone gets paid $2.50 per hour for their labor? This is awful for places like the UK but great for people in Mexico, China, etc. It spreads the wealth. 
PART II:
Now, the thing the rich Bitcoin owners want, is cheap labor. So, they want to pay the least per hour, and make the most, so they keep on inching up the prices at their McDonalds. As McDonalds increases their prices, so does the  landlord, so does the super market. The pay actually flat-lines, but the overall cost of living goes up. This actually makes it much worse for the people. The business owners keep on raising and raising. The workers keep making less and less. It's a system that is intentionally rigged in the favor of businesses. Bitcoin doesn't change that fact. The game is rigged. 
Part III:
Can you explain to me, the devaluation of say, American currency, and how would that be any different on Jurassic Park? Like say we swapped dollars for Bitcoin. The people in charge are still in charge (Business Owners) and they can charge whatever they want, and pay whatever they want (minimum wage). How does 'devaluation' work exactly?
Part IV:
Transitioning from a fiat to a bitcoin, if you are rich, you can just buy up almost all the bitcoin. Then what happens? How is that any different from what is happening now? 
For instance, let's say, that you could take a snapshot of the globe right now. One USD = .75 GBP = One Euro (hypothetically). In this scenario, in this snap shot, let's say we replace ALL currencies with Bitcoin. Like this: One USD = X Bitcoin = .75 GBP = One Euro. In this scenario we basically have swapped out all currency for Bitcoin in this snapshot of time. Now, let's move the clock forward one year, and I bet that the prices of everything go up thanks to business owners, people's pay goes down, and that the currency swap is probably the same relatively. My point is, if you took all the global currency, and matched it to bitcoin, what do you expect to see happen in the future? Is it that the world market will shift, and say, the USD falls but the Yen goes up? The theory is that in the case of Hodlers, if you are in the US you make money, in the case of China you lose money. In the end however, those with the most money, whether it's bitcoin or gold or fiat, will still have the power to enslave everyone else. 
The question I really have, is that so many people here shout all these benefits. And yet, the rich still get richer, whether they buy 50% of the Bitcoin or not. The Winklevoss Brothers will always have more than me, weather it's fiat, gold, or BTC. The only difference is that on the world scale, the Winklevoss Twins would be king if they cornered the market on bitcoins no?

It's dead, but I still will buy.
I think most of the people in this sub, believe that Bitcoin was a 'revolution' and will 'end the banks'. It's all bullshit. What is dead is the experiment of what Bitcoin was supposed to be. On paper, it's a success. IN reality, it's a failure. Well, in reality, it's also a success, but not like people thought it would be. 
What happened? Well I think Bitcoin failed to address the coin of the realm issue. And the exchange issue. Any purchase of say, a house, a mortgage, or any other bank-backed transaction will be processed in the coin of the realm. When I say bank-backed, I also mean government-backed and law-backed. All three are interconnected. I wonder if you can legally buy a house, say in the USA, and pay for it with Bitcoin? In the end, the taxes have to be paid in USD, and that's where this all falls apart. Taxes have to be paid in USD. No matter where you live, taxes have to be paid in the coin of the realm. 
This means that Bitcoin will _always_ be an accessory currency in the realm you are standing (unless you are in a Bitcoin only Country). Whether I get Yen, Yuan, or Bitcoin, it has to have tax paid in USD and you get caught up with exchange fees and taxes again. 
So if I were to TLDR, it's like electric cars. People love electric cars, people know electric cars are better, but the adoption of electric cars is so slow because 99% of the world uses oil backed cars, and the oil industry runs the planet, just as government and government backed banks, run their respective countries. Bitcoin is an amazing idea, but respective to governments, it will have slow penetration as it removes power from banks, and therefore Governments, and will be labeled as traitorous, or supporting terrorism, or drugs, or whatever as it's a threat.

1) Create something deregulated that could topple governments.
2) Governments ban it, realize they can't.
3) Rich people secretly love it because they can launder money, SO
4) They pass regulations 
5) Banks take over as places to exchange your currency
6) And the status quo is maintained. 3% merchant processing fee, global exchange rates, banks make money, and still are predatory.
7) We are back to square one.
It is like watching the Wire where the bad guy at the end is killed and a new bad guy steps up to take his place. It's all a big cycle, and nobody understands that the 'House' always wins. Always.

@_date: 2019-03-31 17:05:14
As long as the Winklevoss Brothers can have a sit down with the heads of other exchanges and write algorithims to rig the prices of Bitcoin, it's really no different than me owning Yen, USD, or other currencies. It is a great idea, but when the electricity is out, you can bet the grocery store only takes cash.

Same with communism. It sounds great in a book, but it doesn't take into account how people are, and how in order for bitcoin to succeed, the entire 'how countries make wealth' must change. Taxes must change, and that's not going to happen. It's a giant pipe dream, and while bitcoin could easily be digital gold, and we don't trade in digital gold and never will. We trade in artificial fiats on a global exchange, the same way we trade gold and bitcoin. It's just another currency that must move from fiat to btc and back to fiat. In order for countries to survive, they can either print their own money, or tax everyone; something bitcoin tries at all costs to avoid. In order for bitcoin to actually succeed, a 'global internet tax' has to be implemented where all transactions globally are taxed, and that tax goes back to the issuing country or countries. Taxes go up and up and up, no matter what currency you use. If you were to dump all fiats and only use bitcoin, the entire world would collapse with no way to tax people (and we are seeing this now with online purchases not paying tax). We need taxes, or fiat. Bitcoin will cause the planet to implode.

Nah. That's like saying the Fanny Pack, which STILL has a place in today's society, will one day come back because it was famous once before. There is not a big enough need for Bitcoin. There is a need, just not a big enough need. I don't see any of the world's global powers collapsing any time soon. Greece, Italy, sure. But the UK, Germany, Russia, and the USA will more than likely stay around, and your trades, wether bitcoin or fiat, will still be based empirically on one of those currencies.

Naturally you will be down voted for reminding people that as of today, they wasted 2 years of their live investing in a potential failure. They could have made more money investing in apple. But it's ok, because bitcoin will hit 12k after Christmas, and settle back around 9k in Feb.
@_date: 2019-11-09 22:51:20
Absolutely not. You fail to see the issue in your argument. Bitcoin _makes_ no money. What I mean, is that in order for Bitcoin to have a giant marketing campaign, it needs to either 1) have a 3% transaction fee, 2) be able to have loans, like a bank, where they loan you bitcoin at a high interest rate and make profits, and 3) Have a high exchange fee. 
Right now, my bank offers me:
1) Cash Back on purchases. Something Bitcoin can't do.
2) Offer Credit Products that offer points and cash back.
So, banks rely on profits to pay their marketing campaign. As long as bitcoin can't generate the same profits as banks, banks can just plain outspend bitcoin. As long as that keeps on happening, they will always win. Remember, the bitcoin strategy is the LONG HAUL strategy to minimize against the devalue of the dollar. 90% of the USA, heck, even the world, lives paycheck to paycheck and so the long haul strategy doesn't apply to them, it only applies to those (with money already) who can invest into bitcoin, keeping the rich as rich and keeping the poor even poorer.
@_date: 2019-11-10 18:06:25
Yes, cash back is a scam for the vendor, but not for me. 
Point was, from a marketing standpoint, banks can outspend over and over and over and because people are so stupid to vote a republican president, it's quite clear that banks can outsmart the layperson with marketing marketing marketing. 
Betamax was higher quality and a better product than VHS, but VHS outspent Betamax when it came to marketing and advertising, so everyone purchased Betamax. It's the same with Atari and other game systems. Others were often better, but the spend and marketing generally out performs.

@_date: 2019-03-16 04:10:47
world money is the same thing. Why do you not get that?
Ok.. think of it like this. Let's say, the US uses USD, and the Chinese use their currency, and the Japanese use the YEN. They all trade on an exchange web, where the value of one against the other changes every day. 
Now, you add in another currency. It's literally like adding another country to the web of currencies. Your countries currency, bitcoin, also ebs and flows based on the world currencies and how they ebb and flow. Whether you are there or not, the currencies will still be there and exist. If tomorrow you decide to never use fiat ever again, you will still have to take your BTC and convert it into fiat to buy a plane ticket to China, or to the USA in their respective fiat, which means, you have to exchange it on the exchange web, which means that your currency is zero sum different than any other currency. Having a 'global' currency is no different than having, say, Cuban Dollars in that they have a percieved value against all the other currencies on the open market. Even if the Yen tanks, you are still on the open market with the US, Chinese, and others. That's why it's a zero sum game, because as long as one fiat still stands and you trade against that currency, so will the rest of the world.

Remember, the Federal Government went and raided Bitcoin, sorry, Full Tilt Poker which was a company located over seas. The first thing they did was to take control of all pointers through the .com and additional web addresses. The USA still maintains all dominance over al major pointer systems in the world, and because of this, can 'shut down' the internet if they really need to.
I am going to make an assumption, that President Obama felt this was too much government power, and so put forth a resolution to make a change. Only problem was he turned it over to humans, and because all humans are scheisters, we now have a potential crisis.

Is there ANY difference between having solid gold and bitcoin in that instance? Like, putting your money in gold vs digital gold, it's still price dependant on whatever CocaCola wants to charge in 10 years. If inflation goes up and a coke is $6, and you have gold, you still have to convert at whatever the price is, and if you are buying Coke in Bitcoin, they will also have a fiat based price, of $6 converted from Bitcoin. So I don't really understand the Bitcoin argument because inflation is global isn't it? Like, global inflation happens regardless of the price of gold or digital gold? Maybe someone can explain how while the devaluation of currency happens, and prices go up, there is also not a relation to gold/digital gold?

Can anyone point to anything like 20 years ago that they said was going to revolutionize things? Like, remember when people said Betamax would be the new standard? Or HD Video Discs? The world is changing so fast, that I can reasonably guarantee that Bitcoin will be replaced with something else that governments can own that uses block chain. That's what people don't seem to really get. That's why Bitcoin is going to be regulated by governments, and there will be a fee or tax to pay for those regulations and enforcement, and that tax will cause the usage fee to quietly creep up to 3% and we are back where we started. Now, this sub can certainly promote whatever conspiracy theories about the end of the world all they want, but I still have to pay my rent in FIAT. I have to pay my car payment for the next 7 years in FIAT. My paycheck is in FIAT. So, just like a zombie apocolaypse, the belief that all of the governments are suddenly going to crash and dissolve their respective fiats is nonsense. If anything, bitcoin is very dangerous, because what will happen is that it if we have a global currency, then all the rich people can buy it all up, effectively becoming king of the world. We have different fiats for this exact reason. Could you imagine if Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos purchased 99.9% of all available Bitcoin, and then Bitcoin became the only currency? The first thing governments would do is make BTC worthless in their local economies and create a new block-chain regional currency. 
@_date: 2019-11-14 02:21:37
That's why this thing is dumb. All the predatory stuff will be in place, and inflation will still happen. It doesn't matter if you own bitcoin or not, if the conversion to fiat is structured in a way out of your control. For instance, if you had to buy a $3 diet coke in 10 years at $6, you will have to convert your bitcoin to USD and that rate will also change due to inflation.

It will never come to mass adoption. 
Let's say hypothetically transactions were free. The system or software you use to track and trade, while now cheap, eventually would charge a 3% transaction fee or something similar. PayPal did it, and they said if you have any sort of vending software, the fee model is the best, and you can provide insurance against any sort of issue, like buying a package and never getting it, etc. 
Plus, credit cards are stupid cheap, and the fees merchants have are a part of doing business. It will be like Apple Pay or google pay, in that you expect to educate large quantities of people that this other thing is better. It's a lot like Betamax or HD Dvd's. It's great technology but it's time has come and gone. The fact that my money goes into a virtual account from my boss, and then I can spend that virtual money on amazon, is no different for me, and as Amazon probably pays less than 1% for each transaction because of the sheer volume, I have to think that if BTC ever really became a big player, MasterCard and Visa would just lower fees, and really BTC would still not be adopted. Really, BTC isn't even on the radar of the VISA/Mastercard vending and purchasing world. I know, you will show articles that say the opposite, but BTC's adoption is less than 1% by vendors globally. It's not going to happen.

Before, we went USD -to- clearing house -to- Yen. Now, we go USD - BTC - YEN. Nothing has changed because the start and end is still specific country's fiat. Bitcoin didn't change anything, other than give a title to the technology in between the USD and the YEN. It's basically the exact same as a clearing house. You created a stable clearing house for money to move around the world in real time. We already have a clearing house, but now at least, it's more secure, so thank you for that.

I am doubtful of a bull run because anyone in the world who has a descent size bankroll knows about bitcoin, so the likelihood that suddenly millions of new people will start buying it is near zero. 
Plus, there is no incentive. Like, I can buy an apple from the grocery store for $1 US, or the similar amount in Bitcoin, but if I pay in bitcoin, I have to convert first, which takes (time) and (fee) to do so. So then the grocer decides to discount the bitcoin price to offset the fee to go from FIAT to BTC, and then back to FIAT so the super market can pay the rent. All of this takes a good bit of time, and time is money. If there is a 1% conversion fee on the front, and a 1% conversion on the back, and a 1% additional labor to oversee and train all register clerks, you are back at the 3% they charge now to use a VISA, and the whole thing is a big waste of time.

At this point in time, there is zero incentive for me to convert my fiat to bitcoin so I can purchase something from a vendor that I already pay no fees. The vendor pays the fees. Even if Bitcoin was adopted moreso than Apple Pay, people would STILL prefer to use their debit cards because it's one less step. Now, I COULD see a system whereby when I use my CitiBank® DoubleCash® 2% Back rewards credit card, I get to check a 'bitcoin box' where it auto converts to bitcoin for the vendor, so that I get a 1% discount, and the vendor gets a 1% discount, because there is (hypothetically) less or zero fraud when moving bitcoins. but unless I get some kind of bitcoin discount that is enough for me to pay to convert my digital fiat, it's really just like Apple Pay, a waste of my life and time to pay for shit I already pay for with my debit card. Until Bitcoin is both CHEAPER for the consumer, and EASIER for the consumer, nobody will switch. Right now it is more expensive, more complicated, and has little fraud protection against getting your money stolen.

The second part (The US dollar weakens sufficiently). This only applies to people outside the US right? I mean, if the dollar to say, the EURO rapidly changes, I still have to pay my rent in FIAT USD. My salary (if I am not fired for cutbacks) will be the same FIAT in USD. 
It's very unlikely that the USD would weaken sufficiently because every global economy is tied to it. I am not saying it won't happen, but I am saying is that if the USD crashes many many other economies will also crash. Gold will also crash, as will Bitcoin. the only thing that will remain is physical cash.

Everything goes through it's IPO or 'fad' or 'buzz' or whatever you want to call it. It's dead now. There are too many currencies and it's muddied the waters. Just as there is VISA, MC, and AMEX, and DISCOVER, so will be Bitcoin, LiteCoin, Ethereum, and all the other coins. It will be essentially the same thing, in that it will be a point of purchase, and because every one needs to 'own' their own variation, Bitcoin as a solo, will be in a market of others. I would not be surprised if Chase has the 'ChaseCoin' to rival Bitcoin. Just because. 
I assure you the banking industry, which rules the entire world, will not go quietly into the night, and because of that, Bitcoin will take years and years and it will eventually be overrun by something better, something else, or something different. The New World Order is coming, and a single currency could very well come, but it makes no sense for individual countries to NOT print currency FIAT.

Thank you for your response. 
I have yet to hear any single good reason for the world to give up power and switch to something more complicated. I hear a lot of hypothetical situations, like 'if the world became Venezuela' but I think everyone seems to miss one big fact. If currency or value of fiat tanked, the first thing 99% of bitcoin owners would do is sell their investments. The holders would cash out, and the price would crash just like the stock market, just like everything else. It's like the price of gold. When stuff hits the fan, gold doesn't go up (like you would think). It actually goes down because the majority sells to cover bills. Then, the rich buy everything up because it's so cheap. It's like, if tomorrow I woke up and there was worldwide panic in the stock market because of Trump and China, and people's stocks were suddenly worth much less, people would quickly rush to sell all of their investments in a panic, and then Warren Buffet would buy it all. The same could potentially happen with Bitcoin. 
Now the real issue is that if Venezuela had a government in which they had no currency, only bitcoin, then Warren Buffet could in theory buy the entire country. So, governments can't have that. There must be a way for them to hold onto wealth. Imagine if your taxes went to a Bitcoin account that the government used, and then a rich person shorted Bitcoin, they could crash your entire country's value also through a mass sell or short sell. 
Fiat has a more stable platform than something that is an investment like Bitcoin. Bitcoin is less a currency and more an investment, and because of that fact, it will be sold for less if the economy tanks.

Can you elaborate?
1. We still have paper tickets and boarding passes, when we could certainly use cell phones with QR codes, but as it's not 100%, we have paper tickets and paper boarding passes. The same with payments. We have plastic debit cards because it's cheap for banks to produce and send. Plus old people don't even have smart phones to even use a bitcoin based purchase system. 
2. Investments/storage of value. You mentioned a safe haven/store of value. We have seen in the last year, several houses do short sales in an attempt to destroy the value of Bitcoin, with some success. So as long as it's seen as an 'investment' and has price adjusted that can be market manipulated, that means that if Venezuela was backed by bitcoin, and warren buffet sold all his bitcoin for 10 cents on the dollar, he could essentially cause a country to go bankrupt. 
3. Gold is probably the best bet, because it has a relatively finite value but even gold can be manipulated by gold buyers and sellers just like DeBeers and the diamond industry. With gold, similar to bitcoin, you always have gold, and you always have bitcoin. However, the price of gold is less volatile compared with Bitcoin (at the moment). Although in theory, over time, Bitcoin might be more stable than Gold. In this scenario, it's perfect, because then it becomes a real standard, better than gold, but as long as it can be bought an sold or shorted, it really creates an issue.

Your point is moot. I could have 'Tom's Turds' as a thing, and get enough social media buzz for Tom's Turds and within about 5 days time, my stock will soar, even moreso if it's tied to an IPO. Everyone knows that after an IPO happens, the stock generally falls back down to a stable price. It happens all the time. It happened with Betamax and Napster and Circuit City. It also happened with Facebook, Apple, and everyone else. 
In time, people will migrate to other alt coins. Ethereum or LiteCoin or something else. The technology is what is important, not the name of what the coin is. Just as people migrated from MySpace to Facebook because facebook was better, so will people migrate to whatever the next technology is. It's like saying that the Desktop Internet will be around forever. Already, Desktop Internet is rapidly dropping and Mobile Internet is rapidly increasing. Technology changes incredibly fast, and while Bitcoin is cool, it's just not getting the mass adoption it needs to actually survive. It's going to be a fad and die out. 20 Years from now people will be saying 'remember Bitcoin'?   it's not going to go back to 20k anytime soon because all the people who control the market already jumped in, made money, and jumped out. It's time is over, the sharks have swam on to the next project.

After all, you get paid in FIAT that gets deposited into a FIAT bank. Why convert to BTC, make a purchase, have that BTC then converted back to FIAT to pay rent? It makes zero sense. As long as banks hold my money from my employer and I have to pay my rent in FIAT, whatever happens in between is irrelevant to me.

The real money isn't in the coinage, it's the processing. 
Visa and Chase, doesn't matter what the currency in the bank is, only the processing fees and interest.

No no.. they are trying to CONTROL it.
The US government has 'internet dominancy' over all things. They can shut down a website in a second, like they did to the gaming website Full Tilt. They set up a law that allows them to remove the routing information and domain information at will, in the name of justice and security. 
Corporations are on another level. The number of people out to control every second of every day of our lives is incredible. It's about slavery and power. When I worked in Advertising, we had focus groups to determine what words and phrases cause people to spend more, buy more, and react in better ways to control you. Now, amplify this a million times by a million companies.
In the movie 'VICE' there is a scene in which Dick Cheney hires a PR firm and they find out that 'Global Warming' is scary, but 'Climate Change' has little to no effect. Suddenly everyone talked about 'climate change' and the phrase 'global warming' was dropped from speeches. 
I honestly believe the only company to actually create a successful coin would be Amazon, and maybe AliBaba, because these are the dominance of where we spend our monies. If you can create a voucher system or coin system then you have one of the key elements of slavery. To understand what I mean, in the heyday of American Slavery, they would pay people pennies per hour to work for them, and then the only store in town to shop in was ALSO owned by the person who paid them. The shop owner had all sides of the money and merchandise. If you can box a human in, you can control them. Think about your employer, their relation to banks and loans. When you buy a car or a home, you are a slave to the bank. It's a trap designed on purpose to plug you in to their system. When you operate outside the system, from privacy to piracy, you can quickly become _percieved_ as an enemy of the system. If bitcoin becomes popular it would be a threat to democracy and removed. But I am getting off track. 
Corporations are all about getting more power and control, and bitcoin is about removing power and control. At some point, this will come to a head, and it will unfortunately change. Remember, Hong Kong wants democratic elections, and China said 'as long as both are Chinese'. That's the reality of our world, you are given two 'selected' options to think you have power, when really you have none. The person with all the money has the power.

So, educate me, because I am a Debbie Downer.
Hypothetically, let's say using Bitcoin for Purchases is only 1% as opposed to the 3% merchants pay, and that the merchant processing company converts it automatically back to FIAT and deposits it into their bank for that 1%. 
And, hypothetically you the customer would have to pay a small fee to convert your FIAT in America to Bitcoin to buy something in Bitcoin, involving (1) an extra step, and (2) an incurred cost of conversion. 
So, vendors would offer a 1% discount if you pay with Bitcoin, so that you the customer, save a very small amount, and the vendor saves a large amount over the cost of a month. 
The question then is, will someone convert to bitcoin to merely save a few cents and also do the extra step? And what's there to prevent Visa or MasterCard from dropping their prices to small amounts too? After all, if they use blockchain technology, then every transaction becomes guaranteed and secure, and their costs drop as there is less fraud so they can lower the costs to the merchants.
Is this accurate?

nobody is going to use it. 
Some mom and pop deli in Fresno, CA will not start taking Bitcoins. Because it will never be 100%, it will be like Apple Pay in that it is cool technology but it will never catch on. Like Betamax. 
The first Credit card appeared in 1950, and AMEX in 1958. In 1988 people were still writing checks, and many were afraid to have credit because it could ruin you. That was a 30 year span, and even then it was not really 100% penetration but it was very close. The chip cards became popular starting 5 years ago, and even now, chip readers are not 100% penetration. Some places don't take chip cards, and obviously the internet doesn't either. Bitcoin is one of those 'looks great in theory' but let's face it in that people are incredibly slow to adopt anything new. There are still people with flip phones. They can't have bitcoins or Apple Pay. There just isn't a big enough demand for bitcoin right now. Maybe 20 years definitely.

Yes. You are right. I merely look at what has happened and really, it's old news now. The hype is over, the price has settled in at whatever it's supposed to be, and like Apple Pay and Google Pay, it's failed in it's ability to actually do anything that it was supposed to actually do. Both Google and Apple Pay were supposed to revolutionize payments and because they never got 100% penetration, were a failed experiment. The same will be with Bitcoin. It's just _TOO EASY_ to use the credit card swipe thing, and I know everyone will say how much the transactions cost, etc, that even if the transaction was technically FREE, there would still be a 3% 'handler's fee' attached to a bitcoin purchase in the USA. Not at first, but eventually. This would bring us a net zero sum, meaning that it's another technology that will just be like Apple Pay. It's cool but like Betamax or HD Dvd's.

Well, if I invested at 20k, and it's been 16 months so far, and we extrapolate that out 20 years, given it's 10k now, means I should hit the 20k mark at 15 years, meaning that I will appreciate zero at year 15. Hopefully, if I HODL another 15 years, I will be dead.

Problem with this, is
The rich would STILL be rich and there is lies the issue. They can still rig the game. For instance, they could go to an ALL bitcoin economy, and buy the politicans and make internet transactions taxed at 400% or, if not taxed, then make the internet so expensive to use so people would have issues connecting to use bitcoin. Point is, rich 'always find a way' to screw the poor. If not, they buy politicans and make them do it.

They can make any bank to bitcoin transfer cost 3%. 
It's easy for any regulated currency exchange like Gemini, to mandate a price fix in exchange to have their permit, just as Taxi Cabs have to pay a fortune in NYC for their hack plates. The government can do whatever it wants, from illegal spying, to not providing tax returns, or even selling Crack Cocaine to it's own citizens (see Ronald Reagan/Jack Webb). America can do anything that benefits the banking industry especially.

If Adoption were to actually happen, governments would collapse, and the world would descent into chaos. We would have one unified global currency, (which we sort of do now because of ACH) but governments need to raise money and value and wealth, through bonds and or paper currency. Without the ability to do such things, the world economy would collapse. Also, because many many many of us are dumb, the rich would hire all the smart people to find ways to find value. Value is determined by items that are worth more than are paid for them, thereby generating more wealth for them, and more poverty for us. This is what we have now in the USA, a system in which those with the most money, can hire the best psychologists and pay the best politicians, to rig the game in their favor. The same with bitcoin will happen but on a global scale.

Highly unlikely because anyone who is anybody already has at least heard of both Gambling, and Bitcoin. The masses have already bought in. There isn't a large pool of cash sitting in the lowest class of people willing to risk their savings (let alone have a savings) on the bitcoin gamble, which means that the only people to really move and shake will be large buyers who knew all about Bitcoin since 2017 and are actively working to manipulate the market in their own best interests, wether it's up or down. Small money like my $200, even if multiplied by 30,000 new people buying in, would probably not even make a dent in the price. So the math question is, what is the NUMBER of people needed to buy in (new) and how much MONEY would they need to bring to get it to $100,000 price? It has to be something so outrageous that it is near impossible. Also, there is a  principle that people will sell in large quantities once it doubles or triples their expectations of what it should be and get their money out which is why it crashed after 20k last time.
@_date: 2019-10-17 02:26:22

It's essentially unused in like 99% of America because payment processors and banks are not budging. The little 1% won't be affected and so banning it is dumb. Until it becomes a real threat to America, then it will be banned. That's why it's important they control it through the use of regulated exchanges. Anything 'wild west' that could disrupt banks and therefore the USA, is treasonous and would be deemed illegal.

Veggie Cash.
It's like Veggie Burger. Veggie Burger serves to lie about what it really is, masquerading as something it's not. 
A veggie burger is the same as a veggie pattie, the same as a veggie sausage. The ingredients are basically 'anything plant based that is mixed with hot sauce to not taste like shit'. Far from beef, it gives bad parents a way to lie to their kids, and push the marketing that a 'veggie burger' is a viable option to something that is delicious as mouthwatering cooked flesh of something you just killed. 
Bitcoin is anything BUT a coin. It's not paper, you can't hold it like a coin. It has no real value. It's solely based on perceived word of mouth. It's like Cabbage Patch Dolls. If I say a Cabbage Patch is worth 20,000 and a guy in China agrees, then we have an accord, and can change money in cabbage patch dolls. Bitcoin is the same. If the weed man agrees, along with 50,000 other people in the world, that Bitcoin is worth $10,000 then it's worth $10,000. It's basically like Stock from the stock market; literally it goes up when more people believe in it. It's like... a instagram influencer's worth goes up the more likes and views they get. Same with Bitcoin. If it falls from popularity, so does it's value, irrelevant to whatever the real stock market does.  On the other hand, when it dropped to $3,000, it's because a bunch of people thought maybe it wasn't worth $20k but worth $3,000. It's literally a reputation barometer between two people on opposite ends of the globe.

When you buy $10k of Bitcoin, in the USA, I am quite certain that the exchanges have to track and trace it. You can't open an exchange with out valid proof of identity, also tracking you. If you use one of those atm things, you have to have a phone, and in America, you can't have a phone unless you show an id. Now you can certainly go to the corner spot and buy a burner, but I think in 99% of the places, you need to have your ID attached. It's very hard to buy bitcoin in america without being identified.

If the economy continues to boom then investors will continue to diversify and there are mutual funds with crypto as a big chunk and so as the boom happens, there is an expectation that Bitcoin will continue to grow but VERY slowly. I am guessing at the (highly unlikely) top number of $16,000. 
On the downside, if there is an economic crash, a war, or a Democrat gets elected, there will be a potential shift in the economy towards conservatism and if the economy tanks, those investing in Crypto will be skittish and pull back. Contrary to whatever bullshit people spew in this sub, the harsh reality is EVERYONE wants to make money, and when the market falls, people freak and sell sell sell, and when they sell and lose money, they will ALSO sell the crypto. Same with people who lose their jobs due to a crippling economy. You think 90% of the people here, if they lost their jobs, would NOT sell their crypto? Of course they would. Rent's due, they gotta sell. This would cause BTC to sink. It would go back to the $3500-4k level.
Lastly we have the day traders. They manipulate the market to swing $5k up/down on a day to day basis. These can be whales too that are moving to make dollars.
In summary, if the economy continues to boom, I am predicting $16,000 at the end of 2021.

Maybe. 
Bitcoin, or any stock is a gamble. Some people (not me) who purchased at $20k and lost their ass, don't care whatever 'theories', 'white papers' or 'increases in value since 0'. They only care that they lost a boatload of money in the last 1.5 years. 
It's like, blackjack counting does work, over a million or more hands, but it doesn't HAVE to. It could be 5 million for it to work out. Eventually, yes counting does work. But our day to day lives are only in the short term. We live rent day to rent day, short term. 
So, if we are talking about the 'theory' of Bitcoin, it's absolutely incredible!
If we are talking about the Financials of bitcoin, then I poo poo it. 
It is basically a giant financial experiment that hurt a lot of people, helped a lot of people, but had insignificant impact on the majority of the world. It is like Tesla. Electric cars are freaking awesome but they are still like 2% of the global market which, is near zero.

There used to be whole teams of flash designers that were 'interactive' designers that made some amazing stuff that made people want to discover the internet.

So, the only follow up to this ,is your point about assets. FEAR drives the sale, and FOMO drives the buy.
If there is a market crash, you can expect the first tier billionaires to sell off. They will sell off ALL assets pending a crash. This includes bitcoin. They are not thinking 'Everyone won't sell'. In fact, I worked with two investment bankers that have 'altcoins' in their portfolios. Investments are probably a big chunk of the movement in Bitcoin. Investments that would sell. I disagree with your point that people are educated enough to not sell. If that were the case, the price wouldn't have dropped from 20k to 3k. Most People ONLY buy bitcoin to make money, and if there is a giant market crash, sell sell sell. Again, fear drives the Sell, FOMO drives the buy.
When people get fired or laid off due to a recession,  they need to pay rent, and they too will also sell bitcoin. The majority of subscribers here in this sub are nickel and dime people, who sink every extra cent into bitcoin. If the shit really hit the fan, and it went from 8k to 3k again, AND they lost their job, you can bet they would be forced to sell. 
The only people who would then win, is the oligarchs. The oligarchs would just buy as Bitcoin crashes. Eventually, if hypothetically all global currencies vanish and we have one uniform bitcoin currency, then the rich would still have the majority share.

Bitcoin will never replace government currency. It can't because governments need a way to create artificial wealth to build schools, pave roads, etc without having any physical gold on hand to back the paper they print. So if Bitcoin won't replace government currencies, it will be come an intermediary currency. This means if you want to buy and sell with real gold, you can. You can buy and sell with cabbage patch dolls, you can. Buy and sell with matchbox cars, you can, or bitcoin even. But the majority of the world, and ALL active functioning governments, will use their own respective currencies. Yes they will inflate the crap out of them. There will always be fraud of some kind, and scams and Zimbabwe is a real problem. But the real issue here, is that as long as governments NEED their own currencies, bitcoin becomes an 'alternative'. So what does that mean? 
When I buy Euros with American dollars, there is an intermediary exchange that says 5 USD=5 EURO. It goes through a third party exchange or clearing house. Bitcoin sits in the middle. So 5 USD = x bitcoin = 5 Euro. It inserts an unnecessary added step. It's not needed. Yes, you can just take bitcoin and buy other stuff in bitcoin around the globe, but as long as you live in a country with a currency, life will be in that currency regardless of what alternative currency you use. This means that _almost_ nowhere, at no time, can someone live entirely off the global currency grid soley on bitcoin. Somewhere that bitcoin is converting BACK into paper fiat currency into a exchange, a bank, or a country currency. 
For this reason, it will always be an intermediary currency. Bitcoin, is like it's own country, BitcoinWorld. You have to convert USD into Bitcoin to do bitcoin related stuff, but then go and pay your rent in USD. Bitcoin can never overtake a county's ability to have it's own currency with out a country where it already has a lot of paper money or gold. 
So that's why it's fun to own some, and it will go up, but as long as we have governments, we will have banks. As long as we have governments and banks, we will need government backed currencies, and as long as we do that, rents, gas, and most other things will _eventually_ wind up getting paid back in government currency.

Ok, so this is probably the only real argument I have heard. But Cash App is the same point as bitcoin. It's a money mover, from one place to another. I can use my bank, cash app, venmo, paypal, bitcoin, AMEX, or some other way to move money across continents. I don't need Bitcoin, which is why it isn't mandatory it gets adopted. At this point, we could literally trade 'amazon dollars' from country to country, based on the relative value of Ramen in each of the 200 major countries. Heck, we could trade in ramen. The in-between doesn't matter because mortages and banks and governments require that you pay in their coin of their realm. So you will not even need bitcoin when I can cash app or venmo or zellie

There is zero NEED for bitcoin in anyone's life. 
• It costs more to exchange USD into Bitcoin and pay someone. 
• Rents/Mortgages/Car Payments/Credit are based on fiat
• You can argue against inflation, but if someone purchased at 20k they lost their ass, regardless of inflation. It would be different if there was a constant value that increased over time. We have not seen that. 
• Banks make profit, bitcoin doesn't. This means Banks can advertise and insure against fraud, and give you special deals like cash back and incentives Bitcoin can't. And while you can say Bitcoin is secure against fraud, I argue that any electronic device can be hacked. NOT Bitcoin, but the device I buy with can be 'cloned' so someone can steal my keys. Every phone, laptop, and non wallet device could be hacked. Even the exchange could hypothetically steal your coins like MtGox? did.

So far, altcoins have been lucky that every time someone tried to link them to drugs and the silk road or terrorism, there has been some rich person like the winklevosses to lobby politicians to keep this going. And yet it keeps on reading like a novel and we are waiting for some crisis involving money funding terrorism through bitcoin or something. Politicians just won't do something ANTI bitcoin unless there is some reason or money behind it. Winklevossess has many people on their payroll to make sure of that.

Everyone talks about adoption. Adoption occurrs if there is a use for it. As an asset, it's no different than a stock, as it can be manipulated by a market value; it's reputation. Just like stocks, it has a relative value. Wealth on the otherhand, is having diversity in everything, including food, so if the shit were to hit the fan, you have ample everything to still retain some wealth relative to whatever the need is at the moment. Rich have gold, bitcoin, cash, stocks, bonds, food, oil, gas, generators, flashlights, etc. Most of us don't. For most of us, we would only use bitcoin as a means to trasnfer money from the USA to say, China. Given that 99% of our online purchases come via Amazon, the currency is irrelevant. If I were to buy in USD or convert my USD to Bitcoin and then purchase from Amazon, the end result is the same in that I am taking 'coin of the realm' and exchanging it for some physical object from amazon. Unless the coin of the realm is bitcoin, which it can't be if a country is to remain functioning, then individual countries will always have their own currency. If a country always retains it's own, then banks, mortgages, loans, and everything else will ALSO be in the coin of the realm. Because of this, Bitcoin will literally be like trading in digital gold. Nobody trades in real gold dust or ingots. They can, but nobody does it. Bitcoin will be the same. There just won't be a use for it because at this end, I need USD. At the end in China, they need their currency. Just like real gold. Real gold is cool to have, but if nobody takes it, it's just cool to have.

The internet is largely now, a failure. 
I would bet that the majority of people only visit fewer than 5 websites. Youtube, Reddit, Facebook, Netflix, and maybe the occasional one website for that thing they need. Maybe plane tickets, maybe to pay a bill. 99.9% of the time they only stay on those 5 sites. During the flash days, you literally browsed websites becasuse they had cool amazing interactive stuff in flash, making you want to see the Corona website. Developers and coders ruined that. Now it's boring divs on a mobile phone. The internet, once a landscape of rich visual content, has been reduced to whatever a lazy coder can do inside a div.

The point I keep on making is because it's all relative to where you are in the market, you can see Bitcoin as a giant loser, or as a giant winner depending on when and how much you bought in with. Because the sub shills positive (as it should) it's important we keep an open mind. Also, time is nonsense when people say HODL. If you purchased at $8k and holded, a year later and it's still 8k. Or two years later it's still $8k. It could very well be that way 40 years from now. It could go inch by inch to 50k, and crash back to 8k. It's all relative to the individual experience. Some will make lambos, and some will lose their ass.

I have to point to the catastrophe concept, that the easiest and most simple form of life happens during a catastrophe.
So, what does that mean? Well, I lived through Hurricane Sandy. Here is a rundown:
1. CASH ONLY no credit or debit cards.
2. ATM's were out of cash as everyone ran to get cash. 
3. BANKS were closed with no power. As were ATM's.
4. Wifi? There was no wifi. There was limited cell service also, and we had no power in which to charge our phones unless we went to the Dunkin Doughnuts. 
So, this tells me that Bitcoin, or any other electronic coin, fails the most important test, and that's the catastrophe test. Now, for the consumer, there is no fee for me to put my money in a bank, and use a debit card. There is a fee paid by the merchant. Some merchants want cash, but most prefer electronic because it means there is less cash on hand for employees to steal, lowering their insurance risk of loss. So, merchants pay a fee to the CC processor, and also get a lowered risk assessment of theft. The old way was all cash, but you had to pay the manager much more so they didn't steal the cash and run out the door. 
Right now, I would have to pay a fee to buy bitcoin. As long as there is a fee, there is no incentive for me to incur an extra step. Plus, it's extra work. I exchange my FIAT to the bank's digital FIAT, then I take my digital FIAT and purchase digital BITCOIN, to then pay digitally to a merchant, who then takes that digital Bitcoin and converts it to digital FIAT, to then get paper FIAT. It's an awful lot of steps to go through. 
Anyway, I love the concept of bitcoin, but like MySpace, it's still just too new. Plus, there is zero inherent value in swapping my digital FIAT to Digital Bitcoin to pay at stores. Maybe in the future it will, but as Hurricane Sandy proved, CASH is still king.

I don't see it. Bitcoin is old news, and the FOMO's are gone. 
We have reached the point where, like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and PayPal, and CashApp, you hit a maximum saturation and people get bored and go back to banks and cash. 
People didn't get into Bitcoin to actually USE bitcoin, they got into bitcoin because they wanted to be overnight millionaires. It's a lot like the Poker boom 12 years ago. Suddenly everyone rushed into playing poker to make millions like the guys on tv with the lambo's. The reality is it doesn't work like that for the remaining 99% of us. The same is true with Bitcoin. 
At this point in time, people with much much bigger bankrolls than you or I, control the price of Bitcoin every second of every day. Their large massive buys and sells can make them money, not us, and they really don't care about long term. 
At the end of the day, it's a game of chess, and when you are one of the pawns, you still have zero power and such a small piece of the pie that overnight millionaires for the 99% of us is unreachable.

The USPS is dying right now because of the lack of bulk mail/direct mail. Within 20 years, they will have to face a crisis because of the impact of email has. Let's say hypothetically Bitcoin was a real threat to ANY government, they would ban it. Just like China and Hong Kong. It's about power. Bitcoin is going to be over regulated to the point where it's a gamble, a stock. It merely replaces the ACH for about 99% of the users. You see, if I were to open a government, the first thing I would do, is issue a paper currency, and print a bunch of it to pay the police. Then the police issue tickets which also have to be paid in government currency. Over time, the government has currency that is the coin of the realm. Banks use government currency, as do employers. If you buy your home from bank financing, you have to then pay in the local currency. So if this is the case, you will wind up paying more than 50% of your bills in government currency. To then go from gov currency to Bitcoin to buy something in China, in bitcoin which then gets converted in to Yuan, is the same as me paying with something that uses the ACH to transfer the money between banks but without the extra step. 
It's nice to dream about all that revolution stuff, but it's just a dream. The reality is if Amazon made amazon coin, seeing as they are the worlds global retailer, chances are people would use that as a currency. Like, if Amazon made amazon gift cards, you could buy whatever from China and pay them with amazon credits. It would be the same as paying with bitcoin. Revolution dreams aside, it just doesn't really fit a need 99% of us have

In the 1980's, former Senator John McCain was a part of the Keating 5, which caused some banks to suddenly go belly up. Literally savings and loan crashed, and there was a run on money at banks and people lost their life savings. People continue to put money in banks to this day.
On 9/11/01, Terrorists used planes to crash into the Twin Towers in Manhattan as payback for US Involvement in the Middle East.  People responded by building an even BIGGER Tower on the SAME SPOT.
October 22, 2012 hurricane Sandy came through and Decimated the coastline of New Jersey. After, the people rebuilt their houses on the SAME SPOT. Same with New Orleans.
If there is one thing I can say about people, is that with HSBC stealing, Wells Fargo Stealing, Capital One Getting HACKED all the time, TransUnion/Equifax/Target getting hacked, we STILL use all of these services.

I suppose the EU is technically an example, so I am wrong, however the point I am making is there is no viable reason that countries would switch to Bitcoin. It does nothing for them, it gives them no value. The reason why countries print their own currency is to create artificial wealth in order to create a government. It's like, you borrow money, hire a police force, and pay them to go get taxes from the people. If you literally began a country on the Bitcoin standard, it is grossly limited by whatever wealth is inside that country, much like the gold standard. The goal then is to have the subjects be used as slaves to manufacture for as cheap as possible, trading man-hours for worldwide gold. Getting gold from other countries IN to your country builds the wealth of the country. There are lots of pros, and lots of cons to this. 
Now, let's talk the reality. Bitcoin, is part of an exchange. Because it's part of an exchange, it's literally like it's own country in that it's price also changes based on the exchange. Weather I want to change my USD into Euro, GBP, Bitcoin, it's all the same. It travels via an exchange who determines what that is worth. Exchanges can be rigged, and have been in the past. Even right now, there is a consortium of exchange owners that know one another. Now, it is my understanding the Bitcoin's price goes down when people sell it. So, if there is a market crash, and people sell their stocks and bonds, they will ALSO sell Bitcoin causing it to drop also. Now you can argue with banks, inflation, printing money, etc, but right here, right now, I can buy in for $20k and lose $12k in 30 days. That is the reality of what is going on. It doesn't matter if it 'beats' inflation over 100 years. What only matters is today, right now, and paying rent. If Bitcoin only went up, you would have a great argument, but because it went from $20k to $3k in a relatively short period of it's life, indicates it has no more stability than USD, or Zimbabwe dollars. It's controllable, just like slaves, just like banks. It can be altered by whales, Russian Oligarchs, or those with money. The entire point of Bitcoin was to take the power AWAY from those with the money, those in control, and in reality, it just puts more power in the hands of those with the money.

Honestly, I hate to admit it, but most of the world are sheep, and if Amazon or Facebook created a partner coin, that would clearly outperform Bitcoin. They can promote it, something Bitcoin can't. Bitcoin makes no money except for the exchanges. So, unless the Winklevoss brothers start spending big dollars to advertise bitcoin, facebook coin or amazon coin will crush the competition. Remember, Facebook can run ADS for their coin every single day where it would cost bitcoin billions to do it. They have access to billions of people worldwide, and it only makes sense that people will buy/sell via Facebook and/or amazon.

It will never reach 30k because it's not attached to Banks, Crooks, and Politicians. Instead, a new coin, the Amazon Coin, or Chase Bank Coin will come next. Where they will succeed and Bitcoin will fail, is because banks will just have a 3% transaction fee and this will provide identity theft insurance, or some other scam insurance, making it 'better than Bitcoin'. To make matters worse, this 3% fee will cover the MARKETING EXPENSE that Bitcoin lacks, and let's face it, people buy the worse of something all the time because of marketing. Itunes still sucks ass and people download it all the time. Marketing is what makes the world go around, not great products. So, if Chase really wants to corner the AltCoin market, they have deep pockets to advertise the shit out of ChaseCoin™ and structure it in a way that they can still make their 3%. 
I bet the future is actually not having a debit card at all, but a new kind of chip card called the CryptoCard™ that attaches to your bank using secure BlockChain technology to prevent fraud or theft. This will cause Visa to go bankrupt, but banks will make millions.

Hang on, I think you are missing something.
Let's talk about Bitcoin's biggest selling point: that you can buy anything globally with bitcoin. This is of course, utter bullshit. For instance, I can use USD fiat to buy something in Chinese Fiat and it goes through an exchange based on the arbitrary strength of the dollar at the moment of transaction. If I use bitcoin, I have to use my fiat to buy bitcoin to buy the product, which then gets transferred back into Chinese Fiat at the end. So, really, the path from fiat to fiat is identical except there is bitcoin in the middle. Now, as long as we live in a country with it's own Fiat, fiat will never go away, and as long as fiat will never go away, there will always be a need to convert from bitcoin in and out of fiat. The thought is that one day I will get paid in bitcoin, buy groceries in bitcoin, and pay rent in bitcoin. It could happen, but then countries would go bankrupt. 
Now let us talk about whatever facebook does in the financial sector. Let's say, facebook creates 'toilet paper rolls'. So, you buy TPR's with your fiat, and you then can buy stuff from china using TPR's which can then be converted back into chinese fiat. It's no different at this point than bitcoin, so why use bitcoin? Plus if everyone decides that TPR is more popular than Bitcoin, then the price of TPR's goes through the roof and suddenly TPR's hit 20k. 
Now as you politely put it, 'people with a brain will understand this'. Have you seen the people on Facebook? We, as a race, are NOT intelligent. Not even a little bit. People waste their whole lives on Facebook and Reddit because they are addicted and stupid. Therefore, Toilet Paper Rolls, or whatever Facebook calls it, will undoubtedly crush but not kill, whatever other banking thing there is.

100% accurate. So, naturally you will get downvoted to hell.
The real reason for the 20k was the tipping point. It hit that exact spot where the truly rich talked to the less rich and Bitcoin became the 'hot new thing' to talk about over cocaine and lobster. Suddenly every Russian Oligarch was buying bitcoin and it went to 20k. Now, it's just that thing we once did, like fanny packs, Zune, and Walkmans. Even the Internet, which everyone says bitcoin is like, sucks now. The internet of my time was one where people threw millions at websites and experiences, and today people spend $6/hr for a guy from india to code in divs because he is worried about ROI from his website. It's a different internet today. It's a different bitcoin today. It's a 'hobby' for people. Banks are too big to fail.

It will never get adopted. There is no reason. None. For the average US Citizen to adopt it. Through the bank, I get insurance, interest, fraud protection, credit, cash back, and people on a 1800 number to help. With bitcoin, if someone scams me out of money or dies, I get nothing. I know, it's the 'stick it to the man' mentality. But you know what, the house always wins. Always. So Bitcoin is great for sending money to China from America, something nobody does in their life unless they are in import/export. For the rest of us, it's unnecessary.

I am not saying Bitcoin will die because it won't. But I will say that it's VERY easy for someone with money to come along and market something that is built on block chain technology and with enough marketing, cause it to quickly crush the competition. 
For instance, right now, you have to take FIAT and convert to bitcoin, to buy something in bitcoin, and then go back to fiat on the end. Why even have all those steps in the middle? If the start and end is FIAT, why even have bitcoin inbetween? Just to save on the fees? It makes no sense. Chase could simply add 'now with block chain technloogy' to their payment services, run a lie-based ad on tv that says 'The Power of Bitcoin, now with ChasePay' and bitcoin remains a back seat forever.

You have to pay an exchange fee. Why would I buy bitcoin and pay the fee, only to buy the exact same thing I can buy with my credit card which gives me 2% cash back on all purchases and if I pay on time, it's a win win. If I buy bitcoin to buy said item, it's a lose lose. Lose the potential 2% cash back, and I lose 2% exchange fee (or whatever it is). 
Only thing to do with Bitcoin is HODL because we want to make money, not lose money by exchanging to buy things. If anything, the person who is making all the money is the Winklevoss brothers and Gemini. The exchanges are making a gazillion dollars every time someone buys more bitcoin. That's the business to be in.

You are missing the point. If you are open to having a serious discussion, read on. If not, close your laptop.
Bitcoin is the 'popular' coin over all the other coins. Facebook is wildly more popular than bitcoin. Now, I know the science behind bitcoin is great, but the actual intrinsic value and 'want' is determined by popularity. The ONLY reason bitcoin's price goes up is because more people WANT IT. There is zero difference between Cabbage patch dolls, or some other valuable thing, like, say, Picasso Paintings. Bitcoin could literally be Picasso Paintings. In 50 years, Picasso might not be as valued, just as Cabbage patch is today, jus as bitcoin might not be in 50 years. 
So, why did Cabbage Patch go from $35 to $10,000 at Christmas? because it was the popular thing. It was supply and demand, and there was demand. Bitcoin went to 20k because of demand and popularity. 
Now, you should be very afraid because Facebook could essentially launch ANYTHING and make it an instant success because they can literally advertise for free, to EVERYONE. That's trillions in free advertising to everyone on the planet. Bitcoin is ONLY advertised by word of mouth and reddit and by the Winklevoss. Imagine the facebook coin and how it will be so popular, like facebook. They could really upend banks, ruin the credit industry, and become so powerful because they will know how much money each person in the world has by the transactions they make. It's scary. 
So, if there was a TLDR, the reason Bitcoin raises is because more people buy in. People buy in because they not only believe in it's merits, but moreso the FOMO which is the arm of Popularity. When facebook launches a coin the FOMO will be so high it will be trillions. It will out perform anything Bitcoin (as a coin, not the technology) can do. It will take the bitcoin tech further faster than anyone else can. But it will also be a sad day indeed.
Sorry, I made an edit.

The US government has already printed more dollars in secret, and purchased large amounts of Bitcoin. Artificial dollars combined with regulation of exchanges, means it can track/trace purchases for tax reasons, it can increase or decrease the value with their purchase, and for all we know, the exchanges are in cahoots to mathematically price fix. Anything is possible.

Just so we are clear, I am going to play devil's advocate. 
Civil Forfeiture is a terrible law, but there is a reason it came to be. (I personally think it's crap). Civil Forfeiture came about because drug dealers went out and purchased millions in new cars, clothes, diamonds, and more with drug money. The LAW (those in power, aided by Police Opinion) felt that if someone got a mere 1 year for a drug charge but made a zillion dollars, that it wasn't fair. So the first law they passed was if they arrested you in your car with drugs, then the car gets impounded as part of the investigation. If they find drugs in your home, then that too, gets seized as part of the investigation. 
IN this case, Snowden is _under investigation_ for crimes against the government. In fact, Trump is ALSO guilty of 'crimes against the government'. I am not talking about the whistleblowing about surveillance, I am talking about his removal of secret information on laptops. I understand completely that (1) he tried to whistle blow and it went nowhere, and (2) So he acted as a rogue actor, stole information to prove his cause. Now, because Snowden is under an active investigation, then just like drug dealers, his stuff is siezed. Should he return, face trial, found innocent of theft of government property (information), then that money will be given over to him. However, you and I know that beyond a reasonable doubt, he took something that didn't belong to him, and they will convict. 
It's like, if a cop knows a person is dealing, and has seen it, but has no evidence, and plants the evidence, the cop goes to jail. That's what we have with Snowden. Snowden went nowhere with his initial whistleblow, so he escalated it with a crime to prove his whistleblow.

I understand what you are saying, that SOMEWHERE in the world, some currency will be the standard, and some will fail and some won't. But, as far as timelines, wether it's one year or ten years, time is the factor. If I said to you tie up $10,000 for 25 years, and at the 25 year mark, it goes to $50k, chances are you still lost money because of other investments you could have made, or interest. Plus, when I am 80, I won't care as much as I do when I am 40, or 20 about said money. 
So based on this premise, we are back to proving or disproving the theory, (which the theory is true), but the financial reality is completely unstable.

The main issue with Point 4, is that it's traded on the same exchange as all others. If you are sending money from the USD to YEN, there is no point to go USD-Bitcoin-Yen. Because you are living in a place besides Venezuela, I can almost certainly swear that at some point you will need to transfer some back to native currency.
To buy something in another country and assume you go from USD - Bitcoin - to other country then you are paying an extra exchange fee. The receiver also pays a fee if they exchange it also. Unless they are in Venezuela of course. Nobody wants to pay 'extra' or do extra work to buy the same thing on the same exchange that can be purchased via the global exchange from USD-YEN. 
People are just too lazy and don't want to spend extra for the same thing. 
They only want to have some minimal banking protection in case the value of the dollar changes, which ONLY affects you against other countries, not within your home country. This means if you sign a 20 year mortgage, 20 years you are still paying the same regardless of the physical value and loss due to the printing of money. Prices will still go up, pay will go down, and you will still be screwed, but the amount will not change.
@_date: 2019-12-16 23:26:10
Ok... fair argument. My point was that the _House_ always wins. Always. 
I am going off on a tangent here. But, think about Hong Kong, Every single person who protested and had their face scanned will be screwed for life. Why? EVENTUALLY the government will go one way or the other. Most likely they will back off today, and then slip through some hidden legislation like the USA does. When the government backs off and the protestors go away, the government still remains in power, with files on each and every person who protested and they will be marked for life. When they apply for a government job, they could easily be blocked. Flying to China? You are on the no-fly list for China. Point is, the House always wins. 
I can assure you that today, right now, you COULD pay for hookers in gold coins. You can also mail gold coins to other parts of the world. Guess what? The government doesn't really care all that much because it's only a small number and therefore not a substantial enough threat to their power. But, if you suddenly had enough people buying and selling and moving gold, the government would find a way to tax, steal, or trace every ounce to retain power. That's the same with Bitcoin. If it was a threat, it would be dealt with. The easiest way is to print money illegally and then go buy a ton through the exchanges and pump and dump and diddle with the exchanges and the prices. Remember, the 'whales' could be the CIA trying to undermine the power of Bitcoin. As long as it's not big enough to be a threat, it's not.

They won't suddenly ban it because of profits. But they will control it through exchanges and banks. They will tax the exchanges when you buy or sell. It's like sales tax on the internet. They don't have to go after every person selling online, but if they go after Amazon, Ebay, and the top ten, they get about 90% of the sales tax. The same will happen with Bitcoin. They will approve transactions, but for the vendor, instead of the usual 3%, Bitcoin will be 4% making it a poor choice for most vendors to use. You can still use it, but it will cost more. That's how the government will regulate it. They won't ban it. But they will so regulate the crap out of it that it will never gain more than a small marketshare. it's kind of like Apple pay. It just didn't really catch on that much in the USA.

@_date: 2019-12-15 19:54:52
No no, you might be missing the point. 
All governments are ok loosing a little bit of power, but when the amount of power becomes too much, all the criminals both inside the governments and outside the governments step in and make laws and regulations to retain said power. 
Now, let's talk about Bitcoin. If suddenly something crazy happened, and the USA outlawed exchanges using Bitcoin, then you would have to exchange say, Chinese currency into bitcoin, then bitcoin back into Chinese currency and then Chinese currency into American currency if you were in America and needed to be paid. All that exchanging would cost you a fee. The fees is where they get you. Now, let's say they didn't outlaw it but it became very powerful. Governments would force tracking via apps, exchanges, and other means. It's like, say, using TOR for web browsing. There have been stories that the US Govt. has already developed a way to trace through Tor to see what websites and what you are up to. Now, Apple will always back governments, meaning that if you own an Apple device, and governments force only apps with tracking in them for bitcoin exchange, then Apple will comply. You could break your iphone I suppose and find a way to download an illegal app, to trade bitcoin without a trace, and to avoid taxes, but the harder and harder the governments make it, the more and more people will comply out of laziness and easyness. It's like American exchanges. Most bitcoin is held in exchanged because it's easy. Sure it can be hacked, sure it's tracked by the government, but people do it because they are NOT revolutionaries and are just too darn lazy. So, as long as that is the way to go, the governments are not too worried.
@_date: 2019-12-15 22:26:47
I agree with what you are saying in Africa.

I got about halfway through.
KNOW YOUR HISTORY!
America almost went bankrupt twice. It was once bailed out by Warren Buffet, and once by JP Morgan (of now JP Morgan Chase). You have to understand that when the government faces this, they will have to give up power to those individuals. That's how life goes. 
Now, there was a time in US History, in which the government made holding gold bullion in large incriments illegal, and purchased the gold back in paper money, so it could stockpile it in the federal reserve, which they have since sold/stolen it. 
The same will ultimately happen again, if the US Govt comes to a point where it _needs_ bitcoin. They will enact laws to force people to sell it if they have it, just like they did with the gold. 
Does this article shill for Bitcoin? Absolutely. But the real question is not about buying bitcoin, but rather why? You see, the whole 'Bitcoin is a revolution' thing is a sham. Government power will never be freely let go. Now Bitcoin is not a threat at less than 1% of the world's economy, but if suddenly it was 50%, then you can seriously bet the government would take steps to over regulate and control it. It's like the police and drug houses. (Or, Neo and the Matrix). They know that there will always be a Neo, or Drug Houses, and they can never get rid of it. They can however, develop a containment system through regulation, that is incredibly effective at minimizing the power it has.

When Sandy hit, the entire 10 blocks around me lost power. We also lost cable and fiber based internet obviously, because the power and cable run on the same pole, both were wiped out. So, all we had was cell phones, but without power, we had a very limited life before they went dead. There were lines of people at Dunkin Doughnuts (who had a generator) trying to hook their phones up. There were like power strips with chargers in them with 50 people all trying to charge their phones to get online or make calls. The internet cell towers were jammed with traffic (One tower was damaged too, so no service in that area) because of every mom with a kid watching netflix, emergency call, or people paying bills or doing whatever they needed to do. There were no working gas pumps (no power) and it was a giant mess. Was the 'global internet' still up? Absolutely. Could we connect to it? Barely. Not enough to adequately take payments because it was like 1G speed due to traffic. The global internet will never go down, but our connection to it could.

Thank you for presenting a valid argument. I don't want you to think I am trolling, and I appreciate your time replying. I like how you framed it as a 'preference' for sound money. I think there is such a difference between the _theory_ of Bitcoin, and the _reality_.  The theory, is that Bitcoin is this scarce way to store value digitally. Therefore it's great because it is _technically_ out of government control. The _reality_ however, is the total opposite. 
• Able to be manipulated by whales OR government agencies who printed money and then bought and dumped. (i.e. CIA)
• Costs more for purchases due to converting fiat into bitcoin to buy something. (exchange fee)
• Price could change relative to the exchange. This means a $5 USD item might be say, 1 bitcoin, and 5 seconds later, cost more or less. When it costs more, it's frustrating to the user creating a bad experience.
• Transaction fees, while low now, eventually rise to the same 3% merchant providers charge as they move over to taking bitcoin in businesses, negating the advantage of using Bitcoin. Plus, because it's not the 'native' currency and is volatile, Merchants are hesitant to take $7 in Bitcoin for a latte, because seconds later it could only be $5 worth, causing them to go out of business. (hypothetically). 
So, with that being said, we have ruled out the following:
• No advantage for a fiat based customer to convert to buy.
• No advantage for a business to take 'non native' currency as it might change.
• No advantage for a business to take it because merchant swipe services will charge 3% like the others. (besides being cool)

Normally I shit on Bitcoin but honestly I have a gut feeling (usually wrong) that it will go back up to 10k. It seems that 3k swings are typical of market manipulation, and that seems to kind of be what is consistently happening. I would love to buy BTC but I don't want to use an exchange where every snippet of my personal life is attached to it. I think it would be cool to take $1000 USD and have a paper wallet with the equivalent of Bitcoin that I could put in my safe. I was joking that I would 3d print a gold bar, and put it inside the gold bar in my safe, making it essentially gold at that point; an item that will fluctuate based on perceived demand.

@_date: 2019-12-16 01:17:25
Well that depends. 
You see, there was a online gambling company called Full Tilt Poker. It was called 'Black Friday'. The US Government essentially forced ICANN to reroute ALL incoming traffic to the website, effectively freezing operations. Once they stopped all operations, they could then 'negotiate' with those in power. This was the turning point in Internet's History, because it proved what we knew all along: that the US has 'Dominance' in the online space. Think about that for a second. 'Dominance in the online space.' They also have 'Dominance in Air Space (except Israel and Saudi Arabia)' They also have 'Dominance in the water'. 
Now, given that the US has said internet Dominance, the whole concept of a pirate website, like the Pirate Bay, is a difficult one to maintain. Countless times it has been seen as a 'threat' to Hollywood, CP Laws, ID Theft, and more. Pirate Bay, while still up I am assuming, is constantly on the run. 
So, while the Internet Bubble burst, the fact the Government and governments of the world 'own' it per the ICANN agreement, means that they can censor at will. 
The Bitcoin bubble burst, and with ongoing increases in regulation and oversight, it will become like gold, in that you can certainly ship gold bullion across the world to pay for something, but most people don't. The same with bitcoin. They don't care if some gambling websites run, as long as they don't get too big. They don't care if some people ship gold bullion over seas to pay for drugs, as long as it's not too much. They don't care if Bitcoin users experiment with this new technology, until it's deemed a threat to the FED and paper money. Then it's a whole different story. 
I also wanted to mention, that at one point in time the US deemed that all gold in excess of a certain number of ounces, HAD to be sold to the government. They could certainly pass laws like this also. It's sole purpose is to put more paper money out there, and take out of circulation, gold (or digital gold). 
So, my constant point in all of this, is that any time there is any threat of any kind to the democracy of the US, or it's allies, it responds accordingly to maintain dominance and power globally.

Only paper money would be accepted if the governments were still functioning at that point, or gold coins.

Honest talk:
I have been poo pooing on Bitcoin for a bit, even while holding some and buying/selling. I think I have finally realized why I am so negative and wanted to summarize my thoughts. 
I feel as though there are two distinct parts to bitcoin. They are both bitcoin as theory, and bitcoin as fact. Each part is extremely important, but also completely separate. 
Part 1. Theory
Absolutely agree with the theory of Bitcoin, that the value of the dollar is going to hell over time, and there needs to be a way to maintain the value of something as currency handles inflation and also devaluation. The main theory behind bitcoin, based on the users in this subreddit, is that with paper money they can print indefinitely until a crash of global economies, in which then a new standard of finite wealth, such as bitcoin, will be erected in it's place so governments can't keep robbing the people through devaluation. Prices will still go up, salaries will still go down, and people will still become poorer, respective of whatever currency you make and you will still become poorer (most of us anyway). However, this assumes that the price of bitcoin, relative to the dollar, continues to rise. It's like, if one bitcoin is $1,000 today, and then in ten years from now, it's worth $1500 thanks in part to the devaluation of the dollar, then you can say that bitcoin is 'devaluation proof' _against_ printed money. The theory then is proven true.
Part 2.
But what happens if instead of it going to $1500, it instead goes to $800 because some whale or exchange rigged, dumped, or manipulated the market? Now you have a whole different can of worms, because no matter what the theory is above, the _REALITY_ is you lost money. Not only did you lose the value of money caused by inflation and printing money but you also lost money due to the trading and relative price. So really you got hit twice. But there is this fallacy in this argument that 'some point in time' it has to go up. This is a falsehood. There is nothing to stop someone else from developing a better solution. It's highly unlikely, yes, but the point is that currency is fluid, and there might be something different in ten years that is better than Bitcoin that we just don't know yet. But, time is not absolute, so what if Bitcoin remains but instead of 10 years, it's 100 years that bitcoin goes to 20k again. Or maybe 150 years. "Eventually", is a potentially long time for you to wait. It's like playing the 3-way lotto, where you say 'eventually number 123 HAS to come out.' Well, _eventually_ it does. Heck of a gamble. 
Had I purchased on the timeline starting on December 15, 2017, close to two years ago, I would have lost $13,000 plus whatever devaluation also occurred which completely invalidates whatever the theory of bitcoin is supposed to be. 
Had I purchased on December 15, 2018, I would have doubled my money, a HUGE win for me relative to devaluation. How can BOTH of these occur relative to the printing of money in which one person sees this as a sucker bet, and the other a overnight rich windfall. And, what if we spread this out over 10 years, or 100 years. To the person who purchased at 20k, it was a massive mistake. To the person who purchased at $4k, they are out buying lambos. IN this scenario, it didn't beat the devaluation, but rather just caused money to change hands from one person to another, assuming they sold and in this case, it's intended theoritical concept failed because one lost, one won, and depending on 'your point of view' this theory is either fact or fiction. 
TLDR The only way for the 'theory' to be true is if everyone who is still hodling makes profit over their purchase price relative to the coin of their country after you account for devaluation also. This means that for the theory to be accurate, it must become inherently stable and show a continued slow rise. We see neither.

I remember in the 1980s there was a MASSIVE bank failure, caused by the Keating 5 (John McCain) and gambling with banks money. There was a run on the banks, and mom and pop in small towns lost their life savings. 
I bet less than 1% decided to buy gold. (everyone went back to banks) Why? Everything is tied to banks. Loans, cars, mortgages, all tied to how much money you have in the bank and who can touch it, borrow it, loan it. 
Eventually there will be a 'bitcoin bank' with the same predatory loaning, same rates of interest, and fraud. When that happens, there will be little difference for anyone to use bitcoin over paper.

'From a certain point of view' yes, and no.

Governments will argue that as long as it's less than 1% of the global economy it's not a threat and is some odd thing like herpes: It keeps popping up, doesn't do anything, but is quietly in the background amongst people. As long as it's not a threat, it's not a success.

Each government can censor ANY website within it's geographical location. They have that right under the ICANN contract with full censorship ability. If they have the right to censor 'Items that pose a threat to democracy, government, and the rule of law (i.e. Banks)' then it can certainly censor them.

It has to be an INSTANT exchange from BTC to fiat so the value doesn't change. No different than paying in Argentina or some other place where the currency is rapidly changing. Plus, to overcome milisecond changes, they actually charge you a 7% transaction fee, 3% for the exchange, and (3% for the payment processor), and 4% possible loss in the seconds the trade happens. These three things make buying in Bitcoin at a 7% increase (because the 3% payment processor is a fixed absorbed cost) so the cost to the consumer would be a 7% increase in the amount. Seems about fair.
@_date: 2019-12-24 16:50:17
Just to be clear, the protestors are Anti-Government, and the people in power will do whatever it takes to stay in power. Naturally, Bitcoin then ultimately will be a threat to government and if they ban merchants from accepting it, what good does it to have 9 mil in bitcoin if you can't buy food? This gets back to the chicken and the egg thing. If a hurricane comes through and knocks out the Cell Tower or the fios, good luck buying groceries with bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-12-01 23:48:59
I disagree with everything you say. 
Banks are too big to fail. 
There will NEVER be a time where people will be able to go to a closed bank, and buy bitcoin from said bank. There will never be a time when people will convert their physical cash to bitcoin. There WILL be a time when people SELL STOCK to buy bitcoin, another stock. It's literally 'digital gold' and old timers will buy real gold, and young people will buy bitcoin. But here is the thing. There has been zero proof that when people are scared or broke or a run on the banks, that suddenly gold triples in value. It may go up a little, but not as much as the people like you think it will be.
There is this stupid fantasy in which 'suddenly within 3 months the world will end, but the Internet will STILL operate, and we will go to a bitcoin standard.' I can assure you that will never happen. The house always wins, always. Those with the gold makes the rules (golden rule). Remember there was a time in which the USA legally forced people to sell them all their gold, and they made it illegal to have gold. Sure some people had it, but a lot didn't. 
What you are suggesting is a time in which people would take all their cash and buy bitcoin? Governments will either raise the tax on Bitcoin to make it astronomical for anyone to use it in their countries, or outlaw it and make it like Pirate Bay. It exists, but when it's only 1% or 2% of the market, nobody cares.
@_date: 2019-12-13 02:55:45

Um no, you missed the point. The point was, if we hit some kind of massive crash, armageddon, or banks on a global scale failing, I can 100% assure you the internet will be the first thing shut off, like they did in Egypt and sometimes do in China. Governments have internet dominance because they oversee both the DNS system, and the pipes that connect you through Verizon/Comcast/Sprint/ATT. If the world falls apart, the backbone will still be there, but connecting to it will be like being in the first Tron Movie, in which you will have to travel a great distance to get to it. Grocery stores of all places will not accept credit, debit, digital, bitcoin, or food stamps, just like they didn't when Sandy hit. They only accept paper. I assure you in the chaos, people would not be safely at home on the Verizon Fios web router buyin on Amazon with Bitcoin.

Thank you for your comment. I have bought and sold bitcoin, and I love the _concept_ of what it represents, but I personally feel like Apple Pay, it's going to be one of those things that only moderately went anywhere. The biggest reason is when the 'global economy' collapses, people get afraid, and they will also sell bitcoin to eat. When this mass sell off happens, because I am going to bet that most bitcoin is held by fund managers, that fund managers get orders for mass sells when the stock market plummets because people don't understand bitcoin beyond it as a stock/asset.
Now, let's get back to this subreddit. It's ONLY goal is one purpose: to convince others to buy Bitcoin so the price inflates and people can then make more fiat as it relates to the price and value of bitcoin. That's my reference to a pyramid scheme. You know how they always tell you to get your friends to buy in and be involved? That's what this sub is about. Get your friends to buy bitcoin! 
The second part of a pyramid scheme is based on the fact of the direction of how your money travels. For instance, you buy toilet paper at the store right? But what if you could buy your toilet paper from me at a lower price? (typical pyramid argument). In the end you get the same toilet paper, maybe at a lower price, but the DIRECTION of where your money went (through Amway, then Costco) is now different. Bitcoin is like that. Before, I just used Paypal to buy generic viagra from China. Now, I use my fiat to bitcoin to China to get generic viagra. Same end result, but a different direction for my fiat. The difference, is that you, the guy above me, made money just like a pyramid scheme.
By me buying in, and getting my friends to buy in, the guy above me (you) the convincer, makes more money.

You cannot buy bitcoin anywhere in the USA without either a cell phone by a major carrier (who already has your ID) or them scanning your ID. It's designed to track any illegal activity that way. In fact there was an article in WIRED about a guy who literally purchased a laptop with gift cards, and only logged on from a starbucks wifi because the second you connect to your home wifi, they know you. The moment you buy a laptop with your credit/debit card, they can track you. Most libraries even need to see ID in order for you to connect. All of these leave a trace that can be tracked back to you. Plus, unless you are running a node and a wallet, you are almost best off getting a paper wallet, which looks just like a $100 bill but it's a bitcoin bar code. So then you need a home safe for paper bitcoin.

I think perhaps, like most of Reddit, I consider myself to be an educated, intelligent individual and when people make up stories and lies or other promotion to get people to buy bitcoin for their personal gain then I feel as though I should step in and fling poop. I do love the idea and the concept. I do love the thought of a global currency but from a theoritical standpoint it's not good for any country to allow that. I am interested in purchasing BTC and I watch the price daily. 
But at the end of the day, if I can't get my neighbor, my neighbor's kid, and the guy down the street interested in bitcoin, I won't make any money. And you can argue about all the technical benefits all you want, deep down, 99.9% of the people here want more money. You get more money by getting people to buy. You get them to buy by shilling. If the guy with the most bitcoin can get the rest of the world to buy bitcoin, the guy at the top of the bitcoin pyramid can control the world. Imagine if suddenly the world fell and Satoshi Nakamoto was suddenly king of the globe because everything else fell and everyone purchased bitcoin and he had the most? Someone you don't really know, owning 50% of the global wealth? That's not power to the people, it's just wealth transfer.

So, basically, you agreed with most of my points. 
I think what is happening is (without reading the white paper) is that the white paper makes a bunch of claims that real and truthful, however these claims fail to address how countries exist and generate wealth within a country. Also, having TWO currencies is extra work, and people are inherently lazy. I would love to see how people who live sole-bitcoin lives exist. I bet that anyone with a bank-backed mortgage is paying in fiat at some point, even if the people living there are not. It's like people who get paid with a payment card for their job. I got a payment card, and never used cash ever. No bank account, just my pay was deposited on this card, and I spent it off that card. I didn't really like it because a third party had my money. 
I like the idea that my wealth is stored in a digital gold on a day-to-day basis. That part is nice. Like, if there is a run on banks, at least my bitcoin will be safe. Problem is, if the market crashes everyone will be DESPERATE for fiat, not bitcoin, and when people are desperate, the market crashes, including those who invest in bitcoin. Bitcoin would crash if the market crash is severe enough. I am not talking small crashes like we have seen, I am talking about a major sell off. When people get desperate enough, they sell everything to get cash as quickly as possible. That's what will happen with bitcoin as well. Anytime you have FEAR in a market, cash will be king.

Don't think for a millisecond that the people with all the money and power in the world won't find a way to strip the power and the money away from the poor. You are silly to think for a millisecond that anyone rich would ever give power BACK to anyone poor. Never gonna happen. Something new will come. Just like Sony Walkman was absolutely amazing. Now we have MP3's. Same with Bitcoin. I assure you, something better will come. Tech has shown that.

You can argue every way imaginable, and if there is one thing I learned, ALWAYS have a stash of cash somewhere. Maybe not a lot, but you never know what will happen. When Sandy hit, we had no power for 3 - 4 days in my neighborhood. People were trying to buy batteries, and charging their phones in their cars, and there was no gas anywhere either. It was really nuts. Gas stations were cash only. 
My point is that everyone here keeps talking about 'the end of the world' when banks all fold. Banks are too big to fail, and the reality is when it gets to that point, nobody knows what will happen. Nobody. I am guessing that a digital coin and anything digital will come to a halt.

Bitcoin won't be as successful as everyone thinks it will be. It will be just like paypal or apple pay. It will be an addition to all the other things out there, like cash app, etc. I think it's great, but I think this sub in general, acts like it's going to be something it isn't. There are infinite coins out there, and the technology is important. The rest is a pyramid scheme to get people to get the price to go up.

Bitcoin is artificial. In the 90's the hottest toy was Cabbage Patch Dolls. They went from like $75 to $50,000 at Christmas because of supply and demand. Cabbage Patch was like 'Plastic Gold'. Now hrm, where have I heard that before? Oh, Digital gold! Just like Cabbage Patch that fell out of favor, just like owning Magic the Gathering Lotus cards fell out of favor, Bitcoin will fall out of favor. 
I really think something like Apple Pay, Zellie, Zoom, CashAPP, will eventually become the norm, because they essentially provide the same service as bitcoin: a reliable way to buy things overseas. It takes fiat, transfers it to a digital gold, then that digital gold is converted back into Yuan to the app holder in China.

- Banks STILL made money during the financial crisis under BUSH.
- Banks forced Google and facebook to not take crypto as it's considered too easy to scam.
- Banks lobby politicians heavily to shut down crypto, and link it to terror organizations and money laundering.
- Banks commit Libor Rigging, (currency value rigging) and almost nothing happens. Barclays still open.

The problem is ALL of those people make trillions off of banks, fiat, corruption, collusion, and changing the LIBOR. They are not going to roll over quietly because 'the people' want an alt coin. Governments will not be like 'ok, let's use Bitcoin'. At least not big ones.

Lol. 
Argument  Anything really cool will ultimately get beat out by something better. This is with Betamax, HD Dvd, MySpace, LaserDisc. Bitcoin will become Amazon Coin, and that will be the new standard and Bitcoin will fail because Amazon has big dollars to advertise the crap out of it. 
Argument  Old People still don't use smart phones, and if you ever lose electricity (Puerto Rico, New Jersey during Hurricane Sandy) you had better have a mattress full of fiat to buy groceries, because they take zero electronic currency. So out of fear, Bitcoin will be such a slow adoption that by the time it's even _slightly_ adopted, something better will come about (see argument 1).
In America, it's a very tiny amount of people who use Apple Pay. Those who DO use apple pay, ALSO bring their debit card along because they are not stupid. In the case of Bitcoin, I can guarantee you that all those who use their mobile devices would STILL bring their FIAT debit card, and because of that reason it will be a fad.

So, it will never get merchant adoption.
Here is why. The price changes, per your argument. 
If my rent is 1000.00 in FIAT dollars per month, but my bitcoin price changes minute by minute, that does me no good. In fact, it's in my best interest to immediately change it back into FIAT because that 1000 is a fixed number, it won't change. But if I got paid 1000 Bitcoin and 30 minutes later it's 500 bitcoin, (assuming it's a 1:1 price), then I just lost half the value of whatever I sold. Yes, it could go the other way, but anyone who owns a business doesn't want to gamble with the rent.

Last I saw, something like fewer than 40k accepted bitcoin. This means 0.01 percent of the merchants worldwide that accept credit cards accept Bitcoin. You should be ok though because the 40,000 are all big players and not small merchants.
@_date: 2018-11-18 01:11:26
This isn't true about FIAT. It IS true about FIAT on the world market, not the local one. For instance, some idiot said that if the value of the dollar weakens globally, that my rent will change month to month. I have a signed lease for the next 5 years that my lease prices are set in FIAT. So, no matter what happens between the USD and say, EURO, the rent will still be the same $1400 month. That's the whole point of contracts. 
Now, the only caveat to this is the idea of 'utter chaos' in which the dollar collapses like Greece. If the US Dollar suddenly collapses then the entire global economy will go with it because everyone buys each other's debt in a circle because all the countries are interconnected. Because of this, there is little reason to allow a catostrophic FIAT crash on the global scale. All the key players want their FIAT to succeed, so they will come together and halt any weakening or problems. 
In the meantime, my rent will still be $1400 over the next 5 years.
@_date: 2018-11-16 03:57:04
1. Why would I PAY to change my FIAT to BTC, to buy in BTC, to convert back to FIAT so the vendor can pay their bills? It makes no sense. If I was buying something overseas, then maybe.. but there is a fee to convert, so why bother?
2. Why even use Bitcoin when there is things like Apple Pay? Again, why even use something that costs more, unless there is a discount attached, but then there is an extra step, which means it makes paying even more complicated. That's why apple pay failed. It's still too complicated to adopt.
3. The USD will not collapse quick. The moment anything severe happens, the government will quickly tax it or find a way to outlaw it or set up a license like they do now. In the USA, you need a license to broker bitcoin. Nobody will spend in bitcoin. 
4. It seems like one giant pipe dream that makes no sense. It's like communism.. on paper, it sounds amazing but in reality, it never works.

Why I sold today....
Banks don't want us right now. Why? They must be in control. That's why no banker ever went to jail, but a bitcoin early founder/user did. Banks rule the world.
Banks are going to do everything they can to crash Bitcoin, so they can control the narrative that crypto is bad. Barclays and several other banks were found guilty of rigging the LIBOR rate, or exchange rate, for profits. IN the case of Crypto, they can't. 
Banks are inherently dishonest (like politicians) however they all work within the same set of rules, and because of that, actually trust each other's dishonesty.
So, they want this to fail so they can create their own crypto or own blockchain. Imagine if Chase said 'backed by blockchain technology' vs 'backed by Bitcoin'. 
So right now, any competition to banks will be met with swift regulation, fear, justice, and dominating the narrative. They will have their top people create the crash on purpose, and I expect it to sink far below 6k.

Altcoins were NEVER a threat to the global banking system. That's the real story here. That's why all this is utter BS. Bitcoin was never going to replace FIAT because it will always be needed by governments to float loans/bonds to build infrastructure and wealth. What it was is an experiment that succeeded in helping banks move money more securely with a software based exchange system that prevents fraud. Banks will always win. The house always wins. The sooner people realize that, the better their lives will be.

Bitcoin could die if there is a big enough sell off. I guarantee if the world economy tanks, bitcoin will also tank. I know you don't think they are the same, but when the economy tanks, people don't start buying gold. They won't start buying bitcoin. 
What you keep thinking about is a white paper vs reality. On a white paper, the transition to bitcoin to the point when all merchants take it can happen, and all global economies can be united. However, governments still need fiat. Rents have to be paid in fiat. ATMS distribute FIAT. I am not disagreeing wiht the 'theory' of altcoins... but the reality is that we are always the lowest common denominator. Drug dealers want FIAT. Power loss? FIAT. Cell towers/Internet down? FIAT. Puerto Rico? FIAT. Again, I am not disagreeing with the 'theory' but the reality is that the theory is wrong. Take Apple Pay and Google Pay. Both thought they would upend the banking and payment systems and they didn't. Bitcoin is a very very slow adoption, and payment processers in the USA don't offer it enough yet, plus there is a FEE to transfer FIAT to BTC then buy in BTC which then goes back to FIAT so the provider can pay their rent. You are adding a layer of complication to it, which means it won't get adopted. If you are starting in FIAT and ending in FIAT, you should stay in FIAT. But unless countries dump FIAT (which will not happen) altcoins will fail to have a substantial impact in the USA.
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:39:13
99% don't care what bitcoin is, because they get paid in fiat, and the rent is due in fiat, and the 30 year mortgage is to be paid in fiat. Knowing that fiat won't change over the next 30 years, means that to most people, bitcoin is merely gambling just like craps or blackjack.

I want to believe, but I don't.
The US Government which is owned by the banks, will not allow Bitcoin to become a legitimate form of currency. 
Today on the news (1010 Wins) they said 'Bitcoin is a block chain currency racked with scams and cheats'. Stuff like this is why Google has denied ANY block chain currency advertising and payments, because the banks don't support competition. Facebook joined today, in that they are not going to accept bitcoin as payments. 
The real reason for this is because the banks rule the world. The faster people realize that 'freedom' is not going to happen. 
In order for it to be adopted and used across the board, it has to be owned by the banks or governments, and thus be able to be manipulated. As it's something owned by the people, it's destined to fail because it puts power back in the hands of the people. 
The news keeps bashing it until it's heavily regulated. Once it's heavily regulated, then suddenly Google will 'love Bitcoin'. 
Once a power transfer happens, then it will be adopted globally. Until then, news organizations and Facebook and Google will continue to refuse to accept it because of the amount of fraud they have gotten.

Nice post. I am a former graphic designer &amp; marketer with a good understanding of what fads and trends are. Altcoins in general are a fad which is as cold now as 3D printing (another fad). Trends and fads always have a rapid rise peak until 90-95% of the key players/purchasers make their move, and then afterwards things slowly die off until a new, better version of the same fad comes along. Just like medical/legal tv dramas, or yahoo then google, or betamax then blu-ray. Fads keep us cycling over and over but I believe bitcoin as a technology will be used. As a replacement to fiat and a replacement for gold? Probably not

46 year old ex ad guy here.
Bitcoin is a failure because _in theory_ it's sound, but in reality, it isn't because of the BEHAVIOR of people. It's like, Kodak's first digtal camera looked like a pie plate, and not like a SLR camera. Nikon came up with the first digital camera that LOOKED like an SLR, and everyone purchased it. We are a creature of habbit.
1. If I break/lose my phone, how do I pay for dinner?
2. If there is a hurricane, internet outtage, or power failure, I better have FIAT in my mattress. Crypto is useless in places like Puerto Rico. 
3. 9,999,999,999,999 vendors still don't take Apple Pay or Google Pay, or Mobile SpeedPass. Bitcoin is behind all of those. 
4. Old people still have flip phones and AOL accounts. They still like checks, and only recently started using plastic as debit. My mom still leaves hers at home (she is old) and uses cash.
5. I have to pay EXTRA to convert to BTC to buy something, whereas when I use CitiBank™ I get 2% cash back, which basically means I make money when I use my FIAT linked Checking Account, vs losing money by paying the Winklevoss Twins fees to convert through Gemini.com. And, it's an extra step. Every step takes time and effort. I want something really simple.
6. My pay is in FIAT for the next salary year. My mortgage is due in FIAT for the next 30 years. So, there is no reason to even mention BTC. If the dollar weakens globally, I still will get paid in FIAT and still pay rent in FIAT.
7. No, we are NOT Venezuela (I am in the USA). No, our currency will not be worthless in the immediate future. Maybe in 10 or 20 years, _maybe_. 
8. All of the people globally with money know what bitcoin is. They are either in, or out, but are not in and out enough to make the thing move to make it go to the moon.
9. There is like 100 alt coins out there. Why should I buy one and not the others?
10. There was a fake bitcoin website right? Bitcoin.com? Yea, not good for old people when it's linked to a scandal and drugs. 
11. Banks hate it, so naturally, credit card processors (Point of sale processors) will equally against anything that means they will earn less profit. There is so much money being made off of debit/credit cards and the processing, they will not switch to Bitcoin.
12. There was someone who had their account compromised right? Mt Gox was it? Someone got their account hacked somewhere and all their bitcoins were stolen. I read about it here on Reddit. We don't even have secure elections, secure banks, or secure processing, and you want us to put all of our money into something NOT INSURED by banks? At least with banks, you could get some of your money reimbursed if you are hacked. Bitcoin? You get zilch.

I think there HAS to be a low point where the broke people who believe the bitcoin lie can buy in. I have little interest in a $3k single bitcoin, but do have interest in a $1k bitcoin. There is something about owning a single coin. It's very dumb, but so are most Americans. The lower it goes, the more people will buy, and thus it will slowly start to even out. I expect it to be somewhere in the $900-$1600 range: that amount is something most people can afford to lose, but the $3k range is a toughie.

But why do you think that? There is no evidence to support this argument. 
Every country needs FIAT. So banks must use the country FIAT. Buying goods from other countries are also in their local FIAT. Using bitcoin is an intermediary that is not needed. There is no need to convert from FIAT to altcoin and back to FIAT. If anything, all the banking in the world will use Blockchain to remove the ACH.
The only incentive to use an alternative coin is to make a more secure vendor transaction system, and guess what? They would still charge 3% transaction fees. Plus, if anything ever changed where the fees were lile 0.1%, The banks would find a way to match it. Banks will not lose because banks are governments. The moment a bank even things it will lose, they will just bribe politicians to make BTC have a 3% fee attached for 'security' or something making it more expensive than regualar FIAT. Point is, it's a game of cat and mouse, and bitcoin can't win.

I think you proved my point in every instance. 
Everything Changes. MySpace, HD-DVD, LimeWire, Napster, BlockBuster, RedBox, Saturn Cars, CRT TV's, Standard Definition, 4-channel sound, 
And, Bitcoin will also change as a storage of value, especially when there are 2,000 other coins out there. Whenever I hear someone say 'it might take 20 years for Bitcoin to adopt' I laugh because by then, the banks will come together and come up with a currency that HAS a backdoor for the government to trace and see. In fact, all of the ideas about it being free will not remain. It will still be taxed, it will still be regulated. FIAT will never go away, and when you go out to eat, you will STILL need BOTH your cell phone, AND your debit card just in case the bitcoin goes down, and they need to make a carbon copy of your credit card on those old knucklebusters (and yes, they still use those when the internet goes down)

The difference before was nobody knew what it was. Now, all the big money movers and shakers are in the game. There is no new money, no new sheeps. It's not ever going back to $10k. The banking industry is just too big to let Altcoin take over without there being fees and regulation.

It's important to tell all your friends to buy some too so that we can get it up to 20k again. It's a game of popularity just like high school. If we can get enough of the popular kids to talk about bitcoin, then the rest of the world wants to buy some too, making it cool. That's how ToysRUs made millions on Cabbage Patch Kids, becuause a few key people said Cabbage Patch were cool, and there was a run on them, making them sell for like $20,000 each. Same with bitcoin. It's an exercise in popularity to get people to believe that some computer thing that is invisible, has any sort of value. It's a giant game of trust. It's like, say you want to buy drugs on silk road, and the dealer only accepts peanut shells because he can trade peanut shells with his dealer, so it moves peanut shells around as currency. So you go buy peanut shells, give them to the dealer, he buys from his dealer, and everyone is happy. Same with bitcoin. It's completely worthless unless you can convince the dealer to use bitcoin. If he uses LiteCoin and you only have Bitcoin, you are basically wasting your time. This is why this is a bit of some bullshit. The ONLY thing bitcoin OWNERS want is for MORE PEOPLE to buy bitcoin. That's it. That's how they make money. The steps to get more people to buy include things like adoption and so they push adoption because if more people believe it has value then like peanut shells, it has value.

When the stock market sinks, so will crypto. 
It's really dead technology. It's a lot like 3D Printing. When 3D printers came out, everyone went nuts. Makerspaces popped up everywhere, and industrial arts/makerspaces popped up in high schools and middle schools. Suddenly 3D printers got cheap from china (and a little sucky) so the entire market cooled. No new technology kept the maker movement going, and even the maker movement cooled. 3D printer sales now are almost dead and more and more shops are closing. If it's not digital, nobody wants it. If it's not a $2 app, it's of little value. 
Bitcoin has hit a similar parabola. Everyone of consequence with money knows what it is or has heard of it. Either they bought and sold (like me) or bought and hold and got screwed. No new people will suddenly buy, which means the crypto fad is over. Banks won't use it for transactions because they make 3% on those card readers which is a lot of money. The system works and everyone makes money so nobody except the merchant wants it.

Flight attendant here and former cable guy also.
There are multiple levels of security that begin when you purchase a ticket until you take a seat in the plane. At every level you are being tracked and watched and checked. 
Your phones 'allegedly' record things you say when certain apps are open, as does your smart TV. I dare you to open Facebook on your iPhone or Android phone and shout American Express, Home Loans, Real Estate, or Building Credit. If you do this for 10 minutes a day, after about 3 days your facebook feed will have AMEX ads, Realtor loan stuff etc. You are being tracked by google maps whenever you drive anywhere. Your phone's location is being recorded all the time.
All your emails sent through your ISP are recorded for 90 days I think, and every website you visit for 90 days is recorded by your ISP and is attached to your computer's ID. All downloads and uploads are also screened and flagged by your ISP in a 'dark room' or 'black room' where things are scanned or read for key words. Too many key words, and you will get kicked out and investigated.

@_date: 2018-11-15 04:20:44
Not true. Every government needs currency and the ability to print it to generate money to build roads and infrastructure. If suddenly the US Government couldn't print money, it would cause a massive financial crash. FIAT is imperative because it gives governments control. Now, if anything, block chain tech will reduce the amount of fraud between banks and it might disrupt the ACH (clearing house) because transactions will be instant and verifiable. However FIAT will never go away on a country-by-country basis. Say a new power takes over Venezuela. The first thing they need to do is generate cash to stabilize the country and build an infrastructure and army. Using global crypto immediately stops this, causing it to sink into chaos again.
@_date: 2018-03-29 02:23:38
I am still not fully getting it. I watched a bunch of videos you guys sent me, and I understand that having a bank-free currency is great, but what I don't get, is that the currency price is based on the US dollar, and that other currencies globally are also based on the US dollar. If I purchase one US dollar Bitcoin at $8,000, and then sell it into Zimbabwe dollars, you still come out with the same (based on the USD) equivalency. 
The fact that it (price) goes up and down, makes no sense to me, as it's then based on demand? Or value of the dollar? And if it becomes the global standard, how does one Bitcoin labor hour of debt in the USA become 8000x the labor hour of Zimbabwe, when it's a global currency?
Also, how do you go to a bitcoin bank, and borrow for a mortgage? Is there someone who takes US dollars (a bank) and buys bitcoin, to loan you bitcoin to buy a house, and you pay back then at the current price? What happens if it goes way down, do you then pay more or less depending on the value of the dollar, if you are getting paid in dollars? I have so many questions. It just seems so much like a fad to me because it's overly complicated, especially when the US Government can print a trillion in paper and then use that to give to Iran, Israel, and other countries as 'aid'. None of it makes any sense when those currencies have no real value.

How? How will you be able to use your crypto's with a card? Think about that for a second. I used to own a business, and I had to rent the swiper thing (merch processor). It was like $0.50 per transaction or 1-3 percent depending on the amount, BUT I got some limited insurance against fraudulant credit cards, which I never had any. Now, let's say they stupidly decided to GIVE UP PROFIT and start using bitcoin (which they wont). Then, their fraud liability will go down, which is great, (more profit) but they still have to mark up some kind of percent equal to enough to make their business profitable. They won't go to 0.001 percent or anywhere near there because then it's not profitable to run a business. So, they will be somewhere around 1.5 percent, and then guess what? Mastercard and Visa will drop theres to 1.5% as well, and people still won't switch to bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-01-31 00:44:32

Because Bitcoin is just like every other thing in the world: Ruled by the rich. The rich rule the banks, and they rule Bitcoin. During times of economic woes, people are forced to sell their bitcoins to pay for things like Christmas Debt. When they sell them at a low price, the rich, who have billions of cash, just buy them at a low price. When they are ready, and they only, they make a few phone calls to others around the globe and manipulate it to their benefit. 
The 'big lie' about bitcoin is getting everyone to buy into some belief that a world without banks is better. But really, it's still largely controlled by the wealthy elites that run the world. The rest is smoke and mirrors for you and me.

BlockChain is a success. Bitcoin will eventually fail.
It, like all new technology, will be adopted into something better, greater, and cooler. Just like HD-DVD, MySpace, Yahoo, Bing, TelNet, LaserDisc, etc.
It went from a tenth of a penny to $4k in 10 years seems like a success to you. To me, if it had more than 50% of the merchants using Bitcoin on a global basis, that would be a success. How many years will that take? 
According to Coinmap.org, on Jan. 3, 2017,  8,207 brick and mortar businesses accepted Bitcoin as a payment method for their goods and services.
Approximately six million U.S. merchants take American Express cards, which is about 30% fewer than accept Visa, Mastercard and Discover.
So, in 10 years, even if we quadruple the number of merchants to 32,000 merchants, that's still such a tiny number of people that accept it, it's not even worth me doing the math.

Nothing. banks rule the world. banks will bribe politicians to over regulate bitcoin to kill it. Then banks will form a summit and create their own block chain currency that they own and make money on. 
Amazon and Facebook are probably the only ones what might be able to go toe-to-toe with the bank lobby. But it would bankrupt a lot of banks if Bitcoin became the world's currency, and therefore that won't happen. Banks just won't roll over. and vanish.

Litecoin or one of the other 2,000 coins that are out there are equally viable. As of right now, Bitcoin has fewer than .1% of the vendors globally willing to accept Bitcoin for payment. It will take 20 years before it catches up, and by then, there will be a new system that is easier or better than what is being used now. Just as cash went to checks, to credit cards then debit cards and then Apple Pay (which failed), Bitcoin will be unnecessary as long as rich people keep their money in banks.

I read like 1 and half of number 2.
I can show you a bunch of fancy graphs and tout a bunch of theories and talk a good TED talk about the end of the financial world, that doesn't mean it's actually going to happen. I still have to pay rent the next three years in the current currency, and my employer will still pay in the same currency as I pay my rent in, so really, your graphs and charts could be 1000000% true and accurate, and also 100000% not applicable to my daily life. 
It's like, someone saying to me that slaves are farming coffee beans in a third world country, and because of it we should not drink coffee. I feel like it's the same argument with Apple Computers and slave children, Wilsons' leather and slave seamstresses, or Amazon workers and slave working conditions. Most humans just don't care. Maybe we are stupid; too stupid to see the writing on the walls. 
But really everything you said, even if it's all true and over my head, is talking about theories of currency and governments and banking. You can show charts that pinpoint that the world is going to collapse due to the student loan crisis. Fact is you are probably off by a magnitude as to when that will happen. Banks are too big to fail. 
My TLDR is all this charts and fancy facts are all great, but so is Veganism and Recycling, things we SHOULD do but just really don't in practice. Same with Bitcoin.

But why not Ethereum? Litecoin? What if half of the world used LiteCoin? Then what? Suddenly Bitcoin becomes less used and therefore of less value. Regardless of all the benefits, people still have to WANT it and pyramid scheme their friends into getting it also. I am not saying it's bad, but I am saying that an awful lot of people need to buy into it for it to go up, and there are lots of altcoins to use as well.
Bitcoin was born out of a need to buy drugs across borders at lightning speed (well, not really, but that's what it's use was for in the early days). So it's got all of these amazing things built in, but so do other coins. Because there are altcoins, there is no real reason bitcoin is any different than peanut shells. There is a coin of the realm based on trust. If my local grocery store doesn't accept bitcoin, litecoin, peanut shells, or IOU's, then it's of no help when I am hungry and have a fistful of fiat. What I need to to, is to talk up the benefits to the grocer so they learn to trust Litecoin, so when I need food, I can use my litecoin.

I think you are missing the point. Banks own politicians, politicians rule the government. Bitcoin removes power from banks which can't happen. You are asking to create a global currency that is NOT owned by banks, that have no fees? Are you crazy? They have more money and guns and power and will link Bitcoin to Terrorism, Cheats, and Scams. They already linked it to drugs. The only saving grace is that the Winklevoss Twins have a good bit of weight in the financial sector and can persuade some people to not write bad press. Even facebook and google won't accept Bitcoin because they were scammed. They won't run any crypto advertisements because the banks don't want it. It's going to be a hard thing for them. 
Take for instance, 3D printing (something I know a lot of), When I mention 3D printing to those not in the field, the first thing they say is 'Oh, yea I saw on the news people can print guns' and immediately dismiss me. The same is happening with Bitcoin. If I mention bitcoin, people say 'oh you can buy drugs on silkroad!' and laugh. Granted these are people who are uneducated about the benefits of Bitcoin. 
My point in all of this is that there is both a narrative and a power angle, neither of which Bitcoin owns. Banks have the power, and control most of the media and narrative. 
I do think Bitcoin get popular at first... but at some point banks have to close bitcoin and create their own "For safety and to prevent fraud" or some other bullshit.

It's important to tell all your friends to buy some too so that we can get it up to 20k again. It's a game of popularity just like high school. If we can get enough of the popular kids to talk about bitcoin, then the rest of the world wants to buy some too, making it cool. That's how ToysRUs made millions on Cabbage Patch Kids, because a few key people said Cabbage Patch were cool, and there was a run on them, making them sell for like $20,000 each. Same with bitcoin. It's an exercise in popularity to get people to believe that some computer thing that is invisible, has any sort of value. It's a giant game of trust. It's like, say you want to buy drugs on silk road, and the dealer only accepts peanut shells because he can trade peanut shells with his dealer, so it moves peanut shells around as currency. So you go buy peanut shells, give them to the dealer, he buys from his dealer, and everyone is happy. Same with bitcoin. It's completely worthless unless you can convince the dealer to use bitcoin. If he uses LiteCoin or peanut shells, and you only have Bitcoin, you are basically wasting your time. This is why this is a bit of some bullshit. The ONLY thing bitcoin OWNERS want is for MORE PEOPLE to buy bitcoin. That's it. That's how they make money. The steps to get more people to buy include things like adoption and so they push adoption because if more people believe it has value then like peanut shells, it has value. So go out there and buy something you don't understand so my Pyramid Level goes up and I make profit.

The problem is that banks have labeled bitcoin. Google and facebook have said there are too many scam currencies out there, so it won't allow any advertising for block chain currencies. And they won't accept payments in bitcoin. 
Banks have backed an initiative to have politicians heavily regulate it, effectively making it identical to us currency, and they know when this happens, people will just remain with US currency. There will be no benefit to trading with bitcoin. Originally there was the benefit of no oversight, people funded terrorism and bought drugs. Soon, banking regulations will put a stop to that with tracing everything. 
It's really been the hot fad that is dying out.

I bet that about 90% of investors _also_ invest in Bitcoin. After all, if you have investment money, chances are you are investing in lots of diverse stocks and alt-coins.
I recently watched the Bitcoin movie on Netflix. It's just like a casino, the house always wins. IN this case, it's the banks. Big Banks _always_ win because they have bigger power. So, they threw one of the bitcoin guys in jail, and set up all sorts of regulations over the purchase of Bitcoin. 
You can't buy bitcoin anywhere in the USA without some kind of bank verification. I suppose that someone somewhere allows you to set up a digital wallet and give someone cash to get around the FBI and the $10k Cash max issue. 
Bitcoin was about trying to have freedom, but this means you can funnel money to terror organizations, and buy drugs, and give money to Wikileaks. Governments CAN'T have this anywhere on the planet because it takes control away from Governments. Certainly the US, Japan, China, and the EU would never have anything that takes away their power without a fight. That's what the movie proved, that you can never take power from the Government, 'the house always wins'.

They never said the internet wouldn't happen. I never heard that, and I am in my 40's. What I DID hear, was that the moment it gets good, Commercial interests, Porn, and Governments would take it over. That's what we have seen. The same will happen with Bitcoin. 
Now, Banks make money by LOANING our money out to others and charging interest, or packaging those loans and selling them to others. When you have a digital currency, how does that work? Is digital currency sitting somewhere where it can be loaned out? 
Plus, when you open a bank, with small amounts of money, they give you extra. You can withdraw more than you put in the bank, and the bank gives you a tiny bit of credit, but then fines the shit out of you. 
Removing the banking issue radically changes why we go to banks. Loans would then be owned by rich people, and be in effect, loan sharks. Banks would not exist to loan out money, because there are no groups of people with money to loan out. Or, is there? Is Coinbase really buying bitcoin, and having accounts, or are they merely holding it all in one centralized location, like a bank? Could Coinbase loan out the digital currency for interest? And if that is the case, is there ANY difference if I am getting fined by Coinbase, or fined by Chase Bank? Imagine if I had a debit card that was a Bitcoin Debit card. Is Coinbase a new type of bank, with the same rules?

It's basically a giant social experiment.
We need a new form of global currency, and Bitcoin satisfies all the major check boxes for it.
Now, the real magic is the psychology of it. You have to basically convince people to buy bitcoin, to raise it's value. It's inherently valueless, but if you convince people it has value, then it has value. It's like Jack and the Beanstalk. If you convince everyone that Magic Beans have value, then everyone runs out and buys magic beans, and suddenly they have value. But if half the world gets burned (half the worlds cash that rich hold, not half the physical number of people in the world), then the value drops. 
So, there is an ongoing psychological pyramid scheme in which your goal is to convince everyone you meet that Bitcoin has value, and to buy some. If everyone gets everyone they know, to buy, then the people at the top of the pyramid suddenly become major wealthy as it creates an artificial value between as many people as it can convince. So, if I can convince you and 3 friends to buy bitcoin, then my $3600 bitcoin might go to $4k.

Thankyou for taking the time to answer. I think the issue I have with Bitcoin is it's a lot like communism. On paper, it sounds like a good hypothetical, just as Bitcoin does, but in practice, not so much. Imagine if countries couldn't print currencies? They couldn't do shady dealings around the world. They couldn't free hostages, move weapons, bribe whomever, etc. So countries NEED their own printable currency. So, while there may be a bitcoin backbone, or blockchain backbone, what does that really do, if the US dollar is the backbone? While you guess that the US dollar might not be in the far future, currency differences need to be there in order for countries to operate. If we have one global currency, then countries too, cease to exist because power is in the currency, wealth, and army. 
I agree that maybe in 100 years, it could happen, but that would mean banks somehow give up control, and I am not sure how we would get mortgages, borrow for auto finance, and do other things without Banks and interest. 
I am still interested in purchasing it, but I don't understand how it's value can change if it is a global currency. If that is the case, is there a part of the world, where I can exchange Dollars to Zimbabwe and then Zimbabwe to Bitcoin, where the price is different from Zimbabwe to Bitcoin? Or, is all currency, including bitcoin, based on the dollar?

SO, blockchain is like owning a lock to your home. MasterLock is the most notable brand, but you can also buy 1100 other brands of locks that work just as well. 
The only issue is that we live in a place where you don't really need locks, but you buy them anyway because one day the world will be come violent enough you will need a lock. You still might not buy MasterLock even then, because a new-and-improved Beta-Lock will be made, and nobody will buy MasterLock.

It has been proven repeatedly that it can also be manipulated to crash or to drop low. 
Now here is the biggest connundrum I have with Bitcoin at the moment. Say I get paid in fiat, and I want to transfer that fiat to China. I can go to my bank, and have them wire it to China, or use Paypal. They use the going rate to transfer it from the USA into Chinese dollars. Now, I would have to go USD to Bitcoin, to chinese dollars, assuming of course, that fiat will never cease to exist. In this example, there is no need for bitcoin's existance. It's an added wasted step. 
Now, what happens in the case of the devaluing of the dollar? If I buy bitcoin at $3,500 for one bitcoin, and the value of the dollar changes? How does it affect my bitcoin? Do I have more money now, less money now, the same money now, especially if the value of the dollar changing also means the value of chinese currency changes? I know there are currency companies that move currencies back and forth all the time from say USD to GBP and back, depending on the market fluctuation and relative strength, so I can see a case for the change there. But I don't understand how the price of the dollar becomes worth less over time, but that Bitcoin does not also change? If all markets are entangled, I have to think that if the Market Crashes, so will altcoins because so much of the money in AltCoins is investment money which will be pulled because people are scared. 
Lastly, and here is the pyramid scheme scenario. In order for Bitcoin to both grow, and for investors to get rich, we have to get our cousins's cousins to buy some. We need new people at the bottom of the pyramid to not only buy, but also trade, bitcoin. We need to be a pyramid so the people at the top of the pyramid with all the bitcoin can become richer, creating a new 1% in the world (which will be very similar to the 1% currently in power giving us a zet 0 change)
I think it's great that all these theories exist, however Bitcoin seems like a pathway to slavery under one rich ruler, and not a way to have seperate countries and separate fiats. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 06:18:56
Yes Yes Yes Yes.
It will be like this the next 20 years, and when they actually care about it, some new technology will come along that will void this. 
Fiat will never go away, as countries will always need to print their own money for loans and such. Because of this, Bitcoin is not really _needed_

I thought scamming was telling your friends, their friends, and friends of friends, to buy crypto so the price goes up so you can then become a millionaire as if it's a giant pyramid, and the more it goes up, the more the people on the different levels also make money by telling their friends to buy.

I don't think that's how it works.
In the movie Trading Places, they 'sell' stock they actually don't have. Then, the stock crashes, and they buy it all back at a tiny fraction, making all the millions in the difference the stock fell. I believe that's called 'shorting'? It's my understanding that large exchange houses will 'loan' you fake bitcoins to sell, provided you have enough cash to cover said coins in the event it goes up and you have to buy them back. Because of this selling of coins that don't really exist, the idea of hodling is really useless at preventing it from bottoming.
@_date: 2019-01-14 05:10:33
Where does the value come from? Quite simple. It's a psychological game. If I can convince you to give me your fiat for some magic beans, then I have convinced you that bitcoin is real and has value. Now, say I convince you that instead of Bitcoin, Amazon coin is better than Bitcoin, then more people will buy Amazon Coin and Amazon coin will be more 'valued'. 
The reason Bitcoin shot to 20k was because of the promoted gossip on the street. Not because it has any real value at all, but because suddenly more people heard rumors and gossip and bought. It didn't matter what they bought. You could have sold macaroni necklaces. What happend though was that the world heard of this new thing, and wanted some. Suddenly there was a demand, and the price went through the roof. It had zero value just as macaroni necklaces have value. But because the people suddenly wanted it, that's the actual value. The demand is the value. If suddenly nobody wants bitcoin anymore, then it becomes worthless. I absolutely love Bitcoin because it's not actually about money or currency at all. It's about technology, that was then altered to make it profitable. It didn't need to be a currency at all. It could just have been a cool tech, but someone specifically made it about money for a reason. It was marketed for a reason, and it went to 20k because of the wow factor. All of those things are gone now. It's an amazing idea and I will still own some. But if the public never buys into it, or even uses it, then it becomes an exercise in a great idea that didn't catch on.
@_date: 2018-11-15 03:25:04

Paypal transfers money instantly.
But step back from that for a second. In order for that to happen, YOU had to TRUST (magical fairy dust) and the person on the other end ALSO had to trust (magical fairy dust). It doesn't matter what the dust is, (bitcoin, altcoins, poop, sine waves, electron particles, flashes of light, peanut shells) but what did matter was both you and the other person mutually agreed that bitcoin was the currency between you. It could easily be litecoin or some other coin also. 
Now, I am not taking into consideration all the benefits Bitcoin has, like the lightning network, the inability to be hacked, etc. because at it's core it's amazing technology. But rather the thing that is going to make or break it, is that enough people drink the cool aid. It's just like Apple Pay. I bet you could have made the bet via apple pay to some other global country, and get paid back in USD. I can't see any real difference? Other than you have to get more people to trust the coin, in effect, like a pyramid scheme. The more people at the bottom of the pyramid, the more wealth the people at the top accumulate. The same is with Bitcoin.

I think you are missing the point. EVERY stock or investment is a pyramid scheme. How it works is that through advertising (which bitcoin has none) or word of mouth (pyramid scheme), you are trying to get people to buy something with no value, thereby giving it a value. The more people you can swindle to buy, the more your bitcoin goes up. If you are the early person, you are at the top of the pyramid. If you heard about it in the middle, you would buy in the middle causing it to go up, making money for the guy at the top of the pyramid. Now, you and the other guy have to get noobs to buy in becoming the new bottom, raising the pyramid even higher by having the price go up. IE Popularity Contests are basically pyramid schemes.

People still write checks. Sure, there are those that actually use a digital transfer system like cashapp to pay people but those are only a handful. Companies STILL write checks and have a treasurer or owner sign checks for purchases. It's been that way for a hundred years.

@_date: 2019-01-18 02:49:56
It changed the world in the last ten years.
It made a few people millionaires and the rest very poor and showed how easy it is to have people buy into the pyramid scheme to get people to buy so the price goes up. So, you should go buy now. And tell your friends friends friends to buy also... and their friends...
@_date: 2019-01-15 02:19:15
So, you are saying Bitcoin will go to $1?
@_date: 2019-01-15 12:15:40
It's irrelevant.
The only thing that matters is the pyramid of you trying to convince your friends to buy, so that YOUR bitcoin goes up in price. If you don't do that, and instead tell them to buy Ripple, the value of Ripple goes up. It's basically a false created need. It's like, you need to eat right? so you NEED food. But what if I took dirt, and said, look at this nice dirt, and convinced you that dirt is cool. Once you think dirt is cool, you buy some dirt, eventhough it has no use. If you can convince someone else to take dirt for food, you are a brilliant scammer. That's what Bitcoin is right now, in that you have to word-of-mouth it's inherent value to con people into buying it so your bitcoin goes up in price and you make money.
@_date: 2019-01-21 01:26:03
It's important to tell all your friends to buy some too so that we can get it up to 20k again. It's a game of popularity just like high school. If we can get enough of the popular kids to talk about bitcoin, then the rest of the world wants to buy some too, making it cool. That's how ToysRUs made millions on Cabbage Patch Kids, becuause a few key people said Cabbage Patch were cool, and there was a run on them, making them sell for like $20,000 each. Same with bitcoin. It's an exercise in popularity to get people to believe that some computer thing that is invisible, has any sort of value. It's a giant game of trust. It's like, say you want to buy drugs on silk road, and the dealer only accepts peanut shells because he can trade peanut shells with his dealer, so it moves peanut shells around as currency. So you go buy peanut shells, give them to the dealer, he buys from his dealer, and everyone is happy. Same with bitcoin. It's completely worthless unless you can convince the dealer to use bitcoin. If he uses LiteCoin and you only have Bitcoin, you are basically wasting your time. This is why this is a bit of some bullshit. The ONLY thing bitcoin OWNERS want is for MORE PEOPLE to buy bitcoin. That's it. That's how they make money. The steps to get more people to buy include things like adoption and so they push adoption because if more people believe it has value then like peanut shells, it has value.

I got about half way into this, and honestly, it sounds like Communism.
On paper, communism sounds like a good idea however it doesn't work because it doesn't placate the human ego, desire for excess, or greed. 
I think all of this, in THEORY, is fantastic. But you are asking Banks, and global leaders in control, to release their control of money? HA HA it's not going to happen. Don't forget, America prints it's own money, and so the value of things changes. If we were on a global currency, printing money when people want bitcoin, becomes valueless in of itself, and governments can't have that. So, just as with communism, it's great to dream, and hypothesize that banks will turn over the money and power, but in reality it will not happen in my lifetime.

It's done. It's a passing fad because in order for Crypto to succeed, they have to take on the banks, and the banks are way too powerful. Plus, the US Government can print more dollars at will, and give it to Pakistan, or Israel at a moment's notice, and while it devalues it, it contains power central to a government's success. Nobody can print bitcoins and just hand it over, because there shouldn't be any devalue or value of Bitcoin either. If it were to truly become a global standard, then all labor hours would equal Think about that for a second. A 'labor hour' would be the same globally. Countries and rich people FUNCTION on maintaining a labor and fiscal imbalance. Slavery, whether economic, or physical, is still a means of control and wealth building. All global economies would come crashing down if one labor hour in America was equal to one labor hour in China or Zimbabwe. 
It's not going to happen in my life time. It's not going to happen in your life time. This is a pipe dream as big as Communism was in the 60's. It sounded good on paper, but it really wasn't that good. The same will happen with bitcoin. It's just a cool fad like MySpace, AOL DialUP, and Online Poker.

Thank you for these answers. I agree with your points, but I also believe it will take 50 plus years, and by then, banks will find a way to dismiss bitcoin, and create their own. Remember, banks and wealthy elites MUST own everything. If we went to a block-chain system, everyone worldwide would find a way to hack or crack it, even if it meant due to the speed over the internet, much in the way the Stock Exchange got rigged over a 50 nanosecond delay due to one broker being closer to the servers than another, allowing him to essentially rig the price to those outside the delay. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:49:10
Conceptually, I agree.
But the house always wins. Just as Trump (an asshole) just voided Venezuela's Blockchain currency, Bitcoin will get heavily regulated by banks, meaning that all of the hidden protections won't be there anymore, and for most of us, it will be done through the banks or a 'regulated financial institution' (i.e. bank). Coinbase, is essentially bank like in how they verify your account, and everything has to be tracked, and traced, and forwarded to the US Government. So, really, what are you gaining?

America will NEVER allow untraceable currency, ever. It's not about funneling money to terrorists. it's about power and control over said currency. HSBC took in millions in drug money for Mexican cartels and only paid Eric Holder a tiny fine. Why? Because the law wasn't about drugs or gangs, or anything else but power.

No New Money.
Thank you. This is what I keep telling everyone in the SUB. All the big players bought in ages ago and either sold to make money in the short term, or stayed out because it was valued at something like 1k. 
In either case, about 90% of the people who could buy, know about it. They just are more worried about chistmas gifts.

- One Bitcoiner went to jail. Zero bankers went to jail.
- HSBC committed money laundering, stacking, and numerous felonies and only paid a small fine and never went to jail.
- Wells Fargo paid a small fine, and no jail time. 
- During the financial meltdown, all the banks made money still.
- Bitcoin has been linked to buying drugs from the old Silk Road.
- Bitcoin allows for un-regulated transactions over 10k, allowing money to fund terror organizations and CP websites, something banks and the US Govt. will not allow.
- Bitcoin allows for a digital way to pay for cash, avoiding taxes and fees, something that the Government can't allow, as they presently push for a sales tax resolution from Amazon and eBay.

More Doom and Gloom from me!
Today, there is a story about Cambridge Analytica, a company who essentially wrote a bot to mine information and then created an algorithm to determine a profile based on your personal information, and target information to you that would lead you down a rabbit hole of dis-information in an attempt to change your beliefs or narrative.
Why this is a big deal, is because Facebook, and Google, and the Advertising community do this on a daily basis from your browser history, and from your Facebook information. They charge for this, and this is what they sell on a day to day business.
So really, this scandal is really about 'Who is in Control". Facebook is being quiet because they do the exact same thing for their advertisers, and must maintain control, and the fact that a third party did it, means that it can't happen again. 
Now, how does this apply to BitCoin?
Governments around the globe must remain in control. They have to have control over currency, money, and banks. Bitcoin was an attempt to come up with a global unregulated, un-corruptible currency. Banks, and their Governments, don't want this. They want the ability to own everything, and control everything.
Note how one Bitcoiner went to jail, and not a single banker has gone to jail. Why? Control and power.
Google, and many banks and credit institutions, are waging a secret war on Bitcoin, because it's a threat to banks, and moreso a threat to governments. 
So, what do we expect to happen?
1. Something bad will happen, and somehow the American Media will say that Bitcoin payments funded it over the 10K limit, (a banking regulation) so they can link Bitcoin to Terrorism. 
2. Political leaders, pressured by the banks, will come out with heavy regulation on Crypto Currencies.
3. Laws will be created where only 'Recognized, permitted banks' will be allowed to trade, buy, and sell crypto, and all financial transactions must be handled by a regulated banking institution, like BOA, Chase, HSBC'.
4. A false crash will happen to scare everyone off. It will be designed to hurt the reputation of Crypto, and to get everyone to move their money out of it, so banks can frame it as a 'bad thing that supports terrorism'.
It will be very important that as people we band together and stop our political leaders from over regulation from the banks. It's going to be a dark time ahead for crypto indeed.

There is panic because banks rule the world, and until banks CHOOSE to own or adopt block chain technology, this is just bs.

Banks make it so easy to not be bothered with bitcoin, and using a phone is not how people will pay. They will always have a QR code or something plastic or paper.

Can someone ELI5 how a fixed currency has a added value?
And to be Clear, if we want Bitcoin to be a physical currency, like say the dollar, then Bitcoin should be a standard and everything else is relative to that. So, for instance, if 1 US dollar equals 1 Bitcoin, and 1 Bitcoin equals 1 million Zimbabwe, if the US dollar goes up or down a tiny fraction, Bitcoin remains. For Bitcoin to go up to $10k, means that the relative strength of the dollar is in the toilet. But as the world is judged by the cost of the dollar, and not BTC, can we ever adopt BTC as the global currency?

Can anyone ELI5 _WHY_ bitcoin is worth investing in?
• Assume everything is (eventually) tracked and regulated by the banking laws, there is no benefit because whatever you purchase, legal or not (legal in my case) is still traced.
• The coin's value is merely going up or down on reputation, and not on any value. It's strictly buying because it's the hot thing. It has no real intrinsic value or cost.
• If the stock market goes down, people will sell BTC, and thus BTC will ALSO go down and crash, so really, it's no different. The idea it will survive the crash is complete nonsense. 
• If all currencies around the globe are based on the Dollar and Libor and Interest, having another currency also based on the dollar does no real benefit. 
Maybe I am confused, so could someone tell me the point of Bitcoin?

I think Bitcoin is like... electric cars. 
1. Everyone sits back and says 'yea, electric cars make sense'. But when it comes to their pocketbooks, they fall in line with everyone else.
2. No matter what, you have to pay rent in FIAT, and to go from FIAT to BTC to go back to FIAT, and pay an exchange fee, is just stupid. It's an extra step. Plus, with my Citi® DoubleCash® rewards credit card, I get 2% back on all charges, which means, I actually make money from a financial institution for once. Sure the vendor pays the 3% on their end, however that's a part of doing business that will always be there. So the talk about banks being bad (which they are) doesn't affect people who are good with their budgeting, so there is zero incentive for me to ever switch to use bitcoin.
3. The failure of Apple Pay/google pay/walmart pay/ every other pay. Capital one has Zellie, and I also have CashApp, and PayPal. Every fucking company has a pay product now. Bitcoin is just another one of those in my mind, except there is a conversion fee first, then the standard payment fee.
4. Bitcoin technology will succeed, but bitcoin itself will not. It has zero value to any American financial institution. 
5. Everyone says 'but what about the dollar? but what about the eventual collapse?'.  If the US currency collapses, guess what? I still have to pay rent in US Fiat, which means, that EVERYONE in the USA will SELL their bitcoin to get FIAT as fast as they humanly can. This will cause a crash in bitcoin just as the global currencies also crash. As the global currencies crash too, nobody will take bitcoin, just as nobody took any credit/digital transactions here after Hurricane Sandy. If you aint got FIAT, don't come knocking. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 22:56:50
My dad (a former bank/money guy) and I always talk about Greece. When you have a fixed piece of property, surrounded by land or water that can not expand, you severely limit it's growth and earning potential. Couple that with near zero natural resources, and you run into a real problem financially.
As you are educated clearly, you also know then that most of the wealth in the world, and also banks and loans, are only centered around the GROWTH and not the PROFIT of a specific thing. It's like, if a restaurant makes 10% today profit, and 10% profit 20 years from now, nobody will touch it. It must show 10%, then 12%, then 14% then 16% profit growth, so the greedy can make and show growth profits. 
When you have a place like Greece, there is little to no way to have growth profits. Yes, you could demolish and build new buildings and hotels, however the cost to do so over the 20 years of business might not equal out, so much so that by the time you get to 20 years from now, the building might be 'old' or 'inneficiant' to whatever new technology is being built then. This is where it creates a real issue for investments in places like Greece. Haiti, Puerto Rico, and many other areas like it, all have the same exact issue of profit growth, and no way to generate it. Plus, even if they could, 'Big Business' would find a way to suck up the wealth and ship it back to the USA or Russia or somewhere else in the globe, rather than keep it locally to develop the country.
Edit: I didn't really have a point I guess, other than I like your TLDR and wanted to add in my 2 cents.

First of all, it's all an experiment that is nonsense.
In the 80's, Cabbage patch dolls sold for Thousands. If you and I agree that a cabbage patch is worth $10,000 then we have an accord. The doll itself really isn't worth $10k, but we both agreed it is. That's what bitcoin is, but replace the cabbage patch doll with air. It's merely an agreement that it has value. Bitcoin is the same. A bunch of people got together and said "Ethereum, Bitcoin, Altcoin" has a value based on demand only. This sub is about promoting and shilling, based on the sole fact that their profits are based on how many people buy. So, the more lies or truths that get people to buy, the better off they are. 
Digital gold is bullcrap. I can buy bitcoin, transfer it to a treznor? wallet, and then put it into a cardboard box that looks like a gold bar. Guess what? It's JUST like gold. It has a perceieved value with no intrinsic value. The difference between the two, is that intrinsic value is things like food, weapons, and tools in case shit hits the fan. Perceived value is standing in Puerto Rico, post hurricane with gold bars figuring how in the hell you will eat and survive with no food, water, or shelter.
Lastly, let's talk about the smug mutherfuckers in this sub who read a white paper who believe in the nonsense in that paper. Pick ANY country after a hurricane, and there is no wifi or anythign digital at all so Bitcoin is worthless. I lived through Sandy, and you know what? The grocery stores ONLY took hard cash. No credit cards, NO bitcoin.
Lastly, let's talk about the WORLD currency. It's all interconnected, including Bitcoin. That bullshit that Bitcoin is superior to change is nonsense. It dropped 3k in a month. It dropped from $20k to 3k in like 6 months. It's just as volatile as a stock in the stock market. Gold has been much more stable, but it too, has a fluctuating value. 
"Bro, you clearly don't understand currency".
I do. There are two things I know for a fact. In an emergency, the ONLY thing people care about is coin of the realm (fiat). When people are scared, they sell investments, stocks, and bitcoin. This will cause it to crash just like the stock market. Also, there is zero benefit to pay EXTRA to convert fiat to bitcoin, not for employers, not for employees, not for people purchasing. No benefit. 
It's like a giant pyramid scheme based on popularity. I own bitcoin, and I tell people all the time to buy it. The reality is if it's not popular, then I lose money. The more I lie, shill, talk crap, and get people to buy, the more money I make. At the end of the day, I will still have cash on hand in case shit hits the fan.

Bitcoin IS a BETTER CURRENCY. It's cheaper, safer, and better.
But, MC/VISA bank cards is the standard, and unless there is 99% bitcoin acceptance, MC/VISA bank cards will be the easiest way to pay for stuff, even if it's less safe. Just like Apple Pay, which is a failure because they never got enough people to switch. Little old ladies just learned to use debit cards and now you expect them to use bitcoin off of a phone?

@_date: 2018-07-12 23:05:29
The argument against bitcoin is this:
During Hurricane Sandy, in the Tri-State area, the following happened:
1. No electricity, which meant no cell service, and no internet in many areas. No internet meant NO credit card/debit card transactions. None. No bitcoin, no anything. It is fiat or nothing.
2. Banks still want fiat. My landlord wants fiat. My lease, is in fiat. Regardless if the value of the dollar crashes. If it does, my landlord's bank will freak, my landlord will probably freak, and if I can't pay my rent, I will be homeless. Fiat is never going away in the USA. As you stated, some form of currency will always be needed, and it can't be anything digital.

IT DOESN'T MATTER.
Why does nobody get it?
If everything in America went to shit tomorrow, the ONLY thing people will take is AMERICAN CASH. 
Everyone who owns Bitcoin will be clamoring to switch it to CASH. In the event of a financial crisis, nobody will take credit cards, or any electronic fund device, including BTC. 
Banks want to get their mortgages in US dollars. Grocery store? US dollars. Not credit, not electronic. Good hard cash. 
Maybe in 50 years it will be different, but today, it's a CASH economy.
@_date: 2018-04-03 01:38:49
Hang on. The second there is any bank issue, the first thing I will do is cash out my bitcoin, which means, bitcoin will also crash. You think if there was a financial disaster in the USA, that all those investors will leave their bitcoin alone? Nope. Baby needs diapers. Suddenly, Bitcoin will also crash. 
I keep hearing all of this.. ... how do I say it, _apocalypse_ talk in this sub, based on nonsense. If we lose power, there is no bitcoin. You need cash. Cash is always going to be king. 
I don't see banks changing any time soon.
@_date: 2018-04-02 23:18:27
Maybe you could explain to me 
I get paid in USD, I can buy from Amazon in USD. You want me to pay a fee, to transfer to bitcoin, to buy the same thing from Amazon that I could just as easily buy in USD? 
On paper, the coolness of the tech is great. In reality, it's like Apple Pay, a failure.
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:50:49
Yea. If tomorrow the banks all closed and collapsed, the first thing the grocery stores would do is ONLY accept American FRN's. Cash is king. The only way cash wouldn't be king, is if the government collapsed as well, and we fell into chaos, in which case, we wouldn't have internet or electricity to use a cryptocurrency. If we have electricity and internet, the government (the US Govt) is still established, and therefore cash FRN's are the only thing that matters. There is no gray area in between where there is free open internet, free electricity, and no government. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 20:29:17
They have control over the internet, and facebook. Every internet transaction travels over government controlled systems. And when I mean government controlled, I was alive and old enough to see massive protocols put into place to be an ISP, in terms of what you MUST record, and for how long. A lot of dial up ISP's folded or sold out because the costs became very prohibitive to record all traffic for a period of 30 days (or longer now). Plus, there was a system where all emails had to go through a filtering process for NSA related flag words as well as all photos and attachments had to be saved for 30 days. There was even in the 'fine print' that said that any attachment you sent over Microsoft, Microsoft owned, and you waived your right by sending it over their system. 
I assure you either it will be outlawed, or such severe restrictions (devised by banks) that really it won't be adopted. 
It's like, what if America created a 'crypto tax' to generate missing sales tax as a result of internet loss of sales tax? This new 'Crypto tax' would be levied by all regulated exchange companies. The moment you do this, suddenly there is zero benefit to exchange American currency to crypto, even if everyone takes bitcoin and cash and credit. That's how they will destroy crypto, by the banks adding a crypto tax.
@_date: 2018-04-16 16:02:36
Yes, and, the first thing Oligarchs will do is have their countries' internet ban any crypto exchanges, or tax the crap out of them. I think of the United States, where Trump could just make it illegal to buy or sell anything legal with bitcoin as it's seen as a threat to our dollar and sales tax. That's all he has to say, and it is dead in the water.
@_date: 2018-04-03 01:04:52
Yea but that's like less than 0.1% of the people are doing long distance high value bank transfers. 
Assume that 50% of the country accepts bitcoin. Then, 50% won't, and the won'ts will only take cash, VISA/MC BANK CARDS. As long as you have to have a bank card, bitcoin has lost the battle because people won't switch. It's like Apple Pay. You still have to have a State ID, so you mind-as-well have your bank card too, because only 30% takes Apple Pay. So you take your bank card for piece of mind. So why then have a different way to pay, if your bank card is still the easiest? I get business have fees to pay, but that's part of the business. If they want my business, they will also take MC/VISA. They might not take AMEX or Discover but they will take MC/VISA. So why switch?
edit I mean take your state ID in a wallet, so you take your bank card also.

ELI5 time. If I buy at $6k, say $500. Then during a big spike, I buy like $20 at a higher price, does the higher price move the needle, or is it the sheer quantity? How does that work? is it volume or price that moves the averaged price?

So we need to have a plastic card, like a credit card, that has your information on it that is linked to a digital bank like company that isn't called a bank. It will be nicknamed a secure wallet, but essentially you will swipe your blockchain debit card, it will debit your blockchain account, and the money will come out of your blockchain wallet to the vendor. When it is EXACTLY identical to a bank account, it will be successful.
It's a lot like digital cameras. The first digital cameras looked like pie plates. Kodak had this weird funky one that nobody purchased. Then a competitor (Nikon I think) developed the first digital camera that LOOKED like a regular camera, and it took off like a rocket ship.

It's important you buy as much as you can, because the first thing that will happen when the stock market crashes, is that people will sell their investments, including those in bitcoin. Bitcoin itself will crash too, and nobody will have any money. It doesn't help to have a bitcoin to cash atm, because the FIRST thing that goes is USD's in ATM's. What good is bitcoin if almost no grocery store takes it and you gotta feed your kids? You will want to cash it out into dollars, and assuming you can, by that point there won't be any cash in atm's or banks.

what is a paper wallet?
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:30:41
Totally incorrect. 
If I have 10k to spend, I want it to make money. When things are going up, that's where my 10k is going. If things go bad, sell sell sell. 
Now, if you are a small time guy like me, and you have bills, seeing you lose your 10k when you have bills suddenly becomes a big deal. If you got 5k in the market, and 5k in bitcoin, loss is loss and you panic and pull your investments out because it's sinking, regardless of the status of bitcoin.
You are making the assumption that people are buying for HODL and really they are buying to make money today, because bills are due today. 
Does that make any sense? My point is TLDR that investors are investors, and it doesn't matter what the stock or currency is. They invest to make money, and if the market bears, so does the currency. The whole concept of 'if the markets tank currency will not' is complete fallacy. The first thing someone does when they need money is sell crypto to pay rent. If the market crashes, crypto will head right there with it.

@_date: 2018-04-03 01:54:39
yea but for what? Like to what end?
The only way bitcoin will really make major changes to life in America and have it's stock go up is if Businesses who have debit/credit card users, can also automatically take bitcoin (for a fee like now). So how does that work? Pretty straight forward. You buy something in a store, and you have some electronic way to pay, which gets attached to your receipt, and for return purposes, they want your name, which really bypasses the whole point of crypto. I know, businesses shouldn't have to pay a fee, but they will need some computer or electronic way, and for most small businesses they will need to convert back to USD for their weekly payroll etc. 
I think eventually it will come, but it will take such a long time, that MC/VISA bank cards will always be simpler and more popular, that the sheer lack of use will cause nobody to use it (just like Apple Pay)

But governments don't want a currency that can't be created at will. They need a dollar or equivalent. And, then you become 'anti-American' by creating something that is going against the dollar, and you will wind up quickly losing a battle. Remember, bitcoin can't be stopped, but it certainly won't win. I think about Apple Pay. Even if you get 50% of the people to adopt Bitcoin pay, that's 50% of the people who will ALSO have their debit card, and for that reason, people will use their debit card. Just like Apple Pay. 
Apple Pay failed because of two things: All Americans must have a government ID on them at all times or risk being harassed by the police. Because you have to have an ID, you have to have a wallet, and if you have a wallet, you could certainly also bring a debit card. The other part is because 50% don't take Apple Pay (or Amex or discover). But everyone takes MC/VISA. I don't know anyone who ONLY brings AMEX, or ONLY brings Discover for that reason. Same will be with bitcoin, except you are paying a fee to use your own money, just in a different way.

When the stock market crashes, cash will be king, and the first thing everyone will do is sell bitcoin and their stocks for cash as the stock market falls. This will in turn cause bitcoin to plummet also as everyone is afraid, and sells. Stocks like Apple will go from $200 to $20. 
In the end, the government can't go bankrupt, so a billionaire like Warren Buffet will step in and loan the US currency to reopen the banks. (This HAS happened before). 
Nobody will take bitcoin, as cash is all they will take.
The only caveat is if the government itself collapses, and that won't happen.

Taking away payment or control is not something they will let happen.

Apple Pay was a failure because less than like 5% of the business take it, which means, even if YOU use Apple Pay, you need cash or a debit card everywhere else, so really, there is no point unless it gets 99% acceptance which it won't. Debit cards are dirt cheap. Anything phone related is not going to work because phones themselves are not great. If I drop my phone on a night out to the club, then I have no access to money? That's the most ridiculous thing ever. Edit: I mean if you break your phone. Obviously you could lose your wallet or phone.

I agree but you are looking like super super far in the future. It's like electric cars like Tesla. Why has Ford, and other companies not made a really good electric car like Tesla? Because they don't want to. They get Big Oil subsidies and they like the way of doing things because it's much safer than take risks on electric cars. Electric Cars are better for the environment, better for the consumer, better in almost every conceivable way, just like Bitcoin is. 
But as consumers, we are incredibly slow to incorporate new technology. Again, Apple Pay failed because they couldn't get 99% of the market to switch. Bitcoin will be the same. Unless you get 99% of the market to switch from USD to Bitcoin, it's only going to flatline, and the US Dollar will still be the standard. If I have to have some form of bitcoin wallet or key on my person, AND also a debit card, the debit card is still winning. Until I can no longer have a debit card, and only use bitcoin, it's just a _hypothetical_, like communism, MySpace, or Napster. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 22:14:14
I 100% agree. Bitcoin is going to be a failure until two things happen:
1. Banks ALLOW blockchain (not Bitcoin) to succeed, so they still get their fees but now a new security measure (blockchain) makes it less likely to hack. Banks (at least in the USA) have already taken steps to limit exposure to Crypto. It's like Apple Pay. On Paper, Apple Pay sounds great. In reality, like nobody ever uses it. I NEVER see someone use it ever. Just like MySpace, Montgomery Ward, and Circuit City, it WAS the hot new thing, but something BETTER came out. Same with Bitcoin.
2. Walmart just introduced the Walmart Blockchain. I see a time when if you buy a lot of merchandise at Walmart, you can get your paycheck direct deposited in Walmart-Coin, and go shopping, transfer that money worldwide, etc. AND, because Walmart has their own bank, you can also use Walmart-Coin to pay your bills (except your rent).

Right. Traditional investments will be sold fast, as will bitcoin. BOTH will plummet the same. It doesn't matter what you have. There is a great misconception that if the American Market tanks, that the worldwide banks will not, and therefore your Bitcoin Price vs USD will remain a constant. As we have seen, the BTC is very volatile, and if we have a banking crash, it will affect BTC in a similar manner. People need and want cash. Short of putting it in a safe in your house, there is no other real alternative, that's why bitcoin is just an illusion.
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:00:35
uh nope. 
Bitcoin is like MySpace. It's a great start, but it's not owned by Banks. Banks and Governments must own everything, so people will go to jail, and payment processors and credit card companies are going to fight it, and it's not going to hit 20k. It will fade as people short sell it, and force it to tank.
@_date: 2018-04-02 23:26:24
I expect it to crash. For instance, if the Dollar tanks, and the stock market tanks, Bitcoin will also tank. When people need cash, like me, we sell our stocks and currencies back in to cash to buy food. Bitcoin and the stock market are interrelated. 
Plus, if I get paid in USD, and buy in USD, why would I pay a fee, to get bitcoin so I can buy the same thing I was buying before but in bitcoin? That's bad business.
@_date: 2018-04-04 03:43:28

@_date: 2018-04-18 18:25:49
Just so we are clear, Bitcoin Exchanges in the USA are essentially regulated by banking laws, effectively making them LIKE BANKS. You put money in, they old it for you. You can get your own wallet, but the exchange is the most common way. They hold your money like a bank does. Soon, they will issue a debit card called the bitcoin card, and you can then swipe your bitcoin debit card to pay for things just like with your bank debit cards, except you pay with bitcoin. The only rub is that in order to get bitcoin, you have to pay a fee. So really, the same swipe and chip you use now, will be the same with bitcoin, the only difference is that there is an extra little conversion fee from USD to BTC.

When the banks fail, what will happen? People will cash out their bitcoin, and bitcoin will also crash. It's all connected. If I had no bank money, I would instantly cash out my bitcoin, causing it to crash. If anything, if there was a bank scare, the price of the dollar and my salary would not change. The stock market, and therefore bitcoin, would take a huge nosedive. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 03:32:57
At the end of the day, it doesn't matter.
What matters is if you are secure enough to leave your bank card at home. That's what you want. Until that happens, bitcoin is useless. I am talking about 90%-100% penetration. If I have a plastic card, it's easier to use than my phone in almost every instance. To make matters worse, because I have to carry ID wherever I go (like 99% of America) then I will also have a plastic card. 
Now, if Bitcoin came out with a credit card that was a bitcoin card, then it could be accepted wherever MasterCard is taken, and THEN you only need the plastic bitcoin card. 
But I don't think that's the point.

Bitcoin is exactly like Apple Pay, and Communism.
Hear me out.
Everyone said Apple Pay, like MySpace and Communism, will change the world we live in. Communism means we can all work less, and share in the benefits and rewards. Apple Pay means we don't have to carry plastic cards with us, and fumble with making payments. No, you can't leave your wallet at home because you need a license, and if you have your license, you better have a debit card in case someone doesn't have Apple Pay, at which point, you mind-as-well just not use Apple Pay, because you have your debit card, and using Apple Pay when you have your debit card is like people who vape publicly and think that they are somehow cool instead of being addicts. 
But this is about AOL, I mean MySpace, I mean, Bitcoin.
Bitcoin allows you to go to your job, get your paper paycheck, then go to your bank or check cashing place, and deposit it or get cash. Now, with said cash, you can buy anything, anywhere. If you have a bank, you can pay for anything, anywhere. But, to make matters even more difficult, now you have to learn and educate yourself about what a bitcoin wallet is. Imagine all the lonely moms asking their kids to help them with a BlipCoin Wallet? Already I can hear my mom calling my phone. Once you learn, you can then sign up online, giving them all your personal details and banking details, transfer money to ANOTHER account, just to purchase the SAME thing you just were going to buy with your debit card. But, now you can be cool in telling your friends you are a bitcoin owner.
My point in all of this is:
Banks are NOT going to allow Bitcoin to take away profits without a fight. New regulations will be swift, strict, and because politicians are bought with Bank Power, Crypto is headed for a bad place. 
Having an EXTRA STEP to pay for stuff you already pay for, makes zero sense. Why convert your cash to bitcoin and pay a fee? For what? To buy illegal viagra from china? I think 99.9 percent of the people won't care. 
Apple Pay again. This is just one more grab for bank power that will go nowhere. 
Just like communism, Bitcoin sounds good on paper, but really is a mistake. 
Edit: I think you should still buy bitcoin, just don't expect it to take over the banking industry any time soon.

 I have watch that video. It wouldn’t matter if he said it was the most amazing thing ever. You still have to convince 300,000 business owners across the United States to take something other than cash or debit cards. That’s what I’m saying to you. I agree that it is fundamentally better, but so is communism. The question is how fast can we adopt it? Look at Tesla cars. Clearly Tesla cars are  much better, better for the environment, safer, don’t use gas or oil. And yet the technology has been around for quite some time, and yet auto makers are still slow to adapt. I’m not saying that the bitcoin Won’t ever be popular, I am just saying it’s not going to happen in the next 5 to 7 years that there is a 99% adoption rate across the country. You might get 40% or 50% penetration, but that extra step means that my visa MasterCard bank card is still going to be better because it is 100% of the time usable

If you are talking about me, I am not a troll. I am actually someone who invested, but to be quite honest, none of the stuff people say here, makes any sense to me. It's all hypothetical and not real. When people say that it's going to be 100k in 6 months, I am like, it was 6k for the last 6 months, so what is different? That more banks in China said so? 
I agree that the technology is amazing. But you are asking people to give up two things: CASH which they will never do, and PAY EXTRA to convert their paychecks into Bitcoin which it MORE difficult to buy things with. There is zero added bonus, and well, people are lazy. Just as Apple Pay failed to gain enough marketshare, but was a great idea, so too will be bitcoin. 
Everytime I watch the videos with people talking about global currency, one thing strikes me as odd. They keep talking as if the United States and global economies are going to suddenly collapse, and go to war, and dollars will be worthless. Here is the thing. If I am in America, and the thing collapses, Dollars will be very valuable in America because nobody will have any. We will all be on bread lines and looking for spare change. Electronic currency will be of little to no value because the first thing people do when there is a problem is allow "ONLY CASH". Not Credit, Bitcoin, or any other currency. I think the same fo the Euro or Brit Pound. If you are living in those countries and things go bad, having Pounds on hand is where the wealth is, not electronic currencies. 
So while I don't disagree with the premise of Bitcoin, I think it will take a revolution to get it to where it makes millionaires out of the guy who bought $1k worth. By that time, Governments will either outlaw it, or find some way to tax it because the Banks control everyone.

If only there was a way to have a plastic card, like a debit card, that could, you know, debit my crypto wallet account, like a bank could? This way, I could deposit my crypto dollars into an exchange that is regulated by the banking industry, essentially making it a bank, so that my debit card from said bank, ahem, I mean, exchange, could change it into crypto so I can use my wallet, I mean, debit card, to pay for things. /s

Listen, think of it like this. Let's say 50% adopt bitcoin. Then you STILL need a bank, and a MC/VISA Bank Card. Everyone takes MC/Visa, not everyone takes bitcoin. That's all you need to have it fail like Apple Pay. Sure it's awesome, but if it's not at least 99%, it's failed as a satisfactory means of payment.

Banks want it to crash, so they will find ways to crash it. They need to make their own Bank-Flavored Block-chain that will allow them to retain power. 
At this point in time, it's an extra step. 
1. Go do a job for someone, off the books, and get paid in cash USD.
2. Deposit the USD in a BANK then convert to Coinbase and buy bitcoin. 
3. Try to find anyone who even takes bitcoin yet. 
4. Realize its frustrating because you could just whip out your debit card and pay without the extra step. 
5. Realize that Bitcoin is a great idea but too early and the world isn't ready nor do governments want it.

You shouldn't trust Bitcoin as a monetary fund. You should trust it as a math problem with 100% security. 
In the event of a crash, the first thing that will happen is people will panic as they try to get as much PHYSICAL cash as possible. This will cause a run on banks, who just don't have enough cash on hand for that, so banks would close. ATM'S would be looted.
So, when that happens, people will rapidly sell all stocks, bonds, AND bitcoin. The value of Bitcoin will rapidly go from $8k down to $5. I know, everyone thinks it won't but I assure you, when people need cash, they get desperate as F to get it. During Hurricane Sandy, they had stores open with 'cash only', and that's what will happen again if the banks and markets collapse. So, if you think of Bitcoin only as an investment and not as actual currency, you will be fine. If you think of it as currency, you will run into a real problem when the market crashes and banks close. 
Typically, when that happens, and BTC crashes along with it, very wealthy people bail out the US Government and banks. They basically loan out their cash to float everything until it can sort out the crash. While this is happening, they also buy the BTC for pennies on the dollar, which essentially means that the top 1% own even more while everyone else scrambles to get their hands on printed paper money.
The videos on YouTube are laughable, as everyone says 'but Bitcoin will survive all of that and be a global currency'. This is only going to happen if two things occur: 1) Grocery stores AND banks allow the taking of bitcoin like a credit card purchase. You need groceries in a crisis and banks to provide trust/liabilities for those purchases, and 2) There is still internet and electricity and access to banking/bitcoin protocols for trade.

Remember Apple Pay? Yea that didn't really catch on.

So really, you are stuck with VISA/MC Debit Cards or cash. I love the idea of a better currency, but trust me when I tell you it's not going to be any better than what we are using now in the United States. Cash will always rule, because it's untraceable.

I figured it out finally, how the USA is going to cripple bitcoin.
They are going to create a new 'crypto tax' in which every time you convert USD to crypto, they will tax it like a gas tax. So you will have to convert it to Euros first, and then try and go overseas. But if you do any in America, there will be a crypto tax. They will pass a law that ALL regulated conversion companies MUST collect and pass this tax in order to be a recognized banking institution, and all others who fail to comply will be investigated for 'providing money to terrorist organizations' and subsequently shut down.
What this does is pretty crazy. It makes it MORE expensive to purchase the same things at home in the USA than with cash or debit cards, which will immediately stop the adoption of it by vendors.
Banks win, the Government retains control, and people who want to have bitcoin for 'funzies' can still do so. Plus, new banking restrictions are in place and are very hard to get or you have to pay a really high fee for a 'banking permit' to sell and exchange BTC.
Edit: yes, I do own bitcoin, and I fear for this kind of stuff.
@_date: 2018-04-02 23:16:56
I look at Bitcoin like Apple Pay. Everyone touted Apple Pay as how great it would be, no more wallet, no credit cards, one simple electronic system, yadayada. But I still need my ID, and if I have my ID, I mind-as-well have my debit card, and if I have my debit card, I really don't need Apple Pay. Apple Pay is an extra step. 
I am not saying on paper it's a good idea.
I just don't think it has value in the US Payment system when it's an extra step and you have to pay to convert your money. It is like, me taking USD to euro, then back to USD to buy something. Why go through all that?

I 100% agree with your LOGIC.
You are completely CORRECT.
However, by your argument, I am paying the fee, instead of the merchant, to get bitcoin. It's a tax. It's low on some websites, high on others.
But I think more importantly, Banks must retain power, and there is power with government printing money and currency. The US Government would be stupid to ever do away with paper money and US Currency in exchange for a global one. It would potentially cause a massive collapse. 
I think your love of the idea (like Apple Pay and Communism) sound great in theory, but in reality, it's highly unlikely to get the banking industry to change and NOT make money on it somehow.

I don't think so. What is the FIRST thing that people will do during a crash? Sell sell sell. Bitcoin will bottom out within seconds if there is a crash because people don't think straight. They are panicked, and sell all their investments. Suddenly that 40k bitcoin hits like $500. That's what the millionaires want, a crash so they can buy it all for cash and then own everything. The 1% always rig the system because they have enough money to buy everything during the fire sale should the banks crash. Sure the upper middle class take the hit but the big players with huge reserves of cash can buy everything up.
Remember, if you are a giant mall owner, and suddenly ALL of your tenants can't pay rent, and you can't pay the bank, you are in big freaking trouble. I would love to know what Simon Malls would do in that situation? File bankruptcy to the builders and sit in trouble, or sell for 1/10 of a dollar to Warren Buffet?

SO, if suddenly the market crashes, or as you think, the government will take your money, the first thing is that everyone will rush to cash out their bitcoin for cash, and a MASS SELL will happen, bankrupting bitcoin. 
I have bitcoin also, because I believe the intrinsic value will go up, but let's be honest, it will be like Apple Pay in which only 50% of the country will take it, forcing you to always have your MC/VISA Bank Card. The difference then between the two, is with bitcoin you have to pay a fee to convert to bitcoin, for only 50% of the US to take it.
@_date: 2018-04-03 01:56:59

Think about this for a second. Let's say I have 10k in stocks, and 10k in bitcoin. Rent's due. Stocks crash, so I panic and pull my money. I will also pull out of Bitcoin. A crash is a crash. 
the concept of 'no one will accept anything else' means that banks are failing to the point that nobody uses MC/VISA Bank Cards, which means that the entire United States has collapsed. As long as the US is still a functional government, banks, and the MC/VISA Bank Cards, will still rule our money and payments.

You are asking me to pay a fee to use bitcoin for the same purchase that I will use with my debit card. It's a hard sell.

@_date: 2018-12-13 00:09:06
Have you ever been to the midwest? People there use checks, and go to the internet at the library and carry flip-phones. 40 million businesses take Mastercard globally. The last report I read said that there are 12,000 businesses that take bitcoin by December 2017. Let's say it has quadrupled to 60,000 businesses. That's still a very small fractional number of the businesses to actually make a substantial dent in who takes it. 
Now, there are obviously, top vendors like Amazon. But for most americans, you have to pay to convert from fiat to bitcoin, to buy the same thing on Amazon you were going to buy anyways, and you get 2% cash back when you use your Citi™ Mastercard which if you pay n time with fiat, you don't get charged any interest. So, really, until it's competitive with banks, there is no reason (yet). 
@_date: 2018-12-19 00:16:14
HAHAHAHAA really? Boy I don't know what white paper you read, but that is a bunch of nonsense.
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:43:26
Yea, what you are saying is all 'theory'... it's like, communism in which everyone works for each other. It sounds nice, but it just doesn't work. Bitcoin is exactly the same. Giving power from governments to the people is the absolute worst thing that can happen globally. No bank or country would give up their ability to print fiat ever. So bitcoin will be just like gold, in that it's a cool concept but not really functional.
@_date: 2018-12-06 02:45:23
So, let's take the bulk of your paragraph. 
You are 'investing', just as if it were gold, or stocks. You are not 'spending it' through vendors. If you were, then your $8.00 purchase would now be $8.08 because you had to buy bitcoin first before spending it. 
I am open to investing, and will invest in Bitcoin because I want it to succeed, but all of the reasons people giving are completely stupid. 
Governments need fiat AND banks to write loans and borrow money, and do all the things it needs like build infrastructures. Your pay will be in fiat, and you will pay rent in fiat. It won't ever end if you are a citizen of whatever country you are in, because they need fiat to keep their government solvent. 
So, what bitcoin does, is allows a go between between other countries, which we already have, called the exchange. Every day the price of dollars to pounds changes. If bitcoin were in the mix, it would just be dollars to bitcoin to pounds, with bitcoin in the middle. But we don't really need that. We can just use usd to pounds via the exchange rate. We are merely adding another step that is not needed.

@_date: 2018-12-09 01:09:04
You have not presented a counter argument.
Banks and the Government always win. The house always wins.
If they were about to lose, they would just tack on a 5% fee on all Bitcoin transactions. It will be the 'internet sales tax' and the government will require all purchases made via all online stores pay it. Those that don't will be shut down. 
Remember, at one point in time, 90% of all domain names were made in the USA, and because of that fact, the government could raid websites like Full Tilt Poker and there was another one linked to Pirate Bay or KimDotCom or one of those where they used legal wrangling to force the domain to be blocked. 
Everyone thinks they can take on governments. That's called Treason. That's why Bitcoin can never overtake banks.

I don't need to do any research if it's not being widely adopted (which it's not). Remember, the banks, ahem, I mean, the 'house' always wins. Banks and Countries are one and the same. One can't exist without the other. The mere fact you are creating something that is designed to intentionally undermine a country is in itself, traitorous. 
Now, I do want to invest in bitcoin just because I am a FOMO, but everything I have read is mere speculation and 'THEORY'. On paper, it looks amazing, In reality, it doesn't work. 
I strongly encourage you to close all your banks and credit cards. Use only Bitcoin and then go buy a house. What? You have no credit? But why? What? You can't get a bitcoin loan because it's untraceable? 
Yea, you need credit and you need banks. They go hand in hand. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 02:33:57
Thank you for your reasonable, well thought out argument.
I completely agree with your points.
Folks learned how to use a HD-DVD, only for it to be replaced by Blu-Ray. Folks learned how to use checks, only to have them be replaced by credit cards and then debit cards. And only within the last year, chip-cards. 
Progress on the use of Bitcoin is so slow that it will die before it's used as it's intended, only to have the technology stripped and banks create something better, just as Blu-ray beat out HD-DVD. 
I definitely think SOME form of block-chain currency will happen but it will really ONLY benefit the ACH (clearing house) between banks. 
Govrnments need to print money, have mortgages, banks, and loans. They all need fiat to continue to operate. Sometimes governments like Venezuela and Greece will fall. For those that do not, the people in the country will still get paid in fiat, which means there is a FEE to switch to bitcoin to buy something in bitcoin, making it instantly worse for the customer to use.

Amazon is NOT massively successful in part of their 1-click ordering system. Let's roll back that statement. They are massively successful due to multiple business practices including their PRIME shipping, the way they qualify vendors, and their no-hassle refund policy. 
I think most of America is still not sold on mobile payments because the VENDORS are not sold on it. It is Chicken and the Egg.
If more vendors have Apple Pay, more people might get apple pay, but vendors won't get apple pay because if people are ALREADY swiping their cards, why would they need it? Ask anyone with apple pay and they ALWAYS bring their bank card also. Same with Bitcoin. There will be a bitcoin swiper card for swiping purchases to your bitcoin wallet.

Lol No BS bro. 
People come here and say things like "When governments fail, where will the people turn to? Bitcoin is the answer". You are smart enough to know that it will never happen. Never. All economies are interconnected. If the US Economy tanks, so will China, So will Tokyo, so will Dubai, so will Europe. We are all interconnected like a giant spider web. Countries NEED their own cash to float their own loans. Hence, Bitcoin is not the answer they will use. If anything, they will come together and create their own. No country would EVER lose power to a global sharing of currency. Are you crazy?  That would cause the world to plunge into chaos. Countries need to retain power in order to have law.

So, Fiat will always be better than bitcoin. Unless you NEVER leave your house, you will always have some kind of swiper card, NOT a phone. If you have Apple pay now, you still always also carry a swipe bank card. Same will happen in the future. Going in public will require you to have some brick-n-mortar payment system that is not a phone. Phones die of battery issues all the time, as does dropping it and breaking the screen. it's just not a good way to pay, and for that reason, paying face to face is not going to be a mobile solution as the dominant system.

Uh, countries NEED taxes to pay for police, roads, infrastructure, water. You have only bitcoin? They eventually will have a tax. They have to, otherwise how will roads be built? That's the thing the people in this sub forget. They say 'f the banks' but have zero understanding on how governments work. Zero understanding on why banks are important to a civilization, and why banks are needed to facilitate loans and credit. I am not discounting the positives associated with Bitcoin, but in the end, banks are an essential necessity for a country to run effectively, as are taxes.

Apple Pay started 4 years ago, and still has not cracked 50% of the vendors globally. Apple pay is a FREE service, meaning you don't pay extra to buy tokens or coins first. Given that Apple pay still hasn't cracked the majority of vendors after 4 years, Bitcoin certainly won't do it after 10. Now, it might be like a stock or gold as an inherent value storage system, but in the end, it's merely an experiment. A great experiment. But as far as a purchase system, I just don't see it.

Look, the reality is human corruption. Americans desperately fail to realize that the people in charge are a mix of rich billionaires and the Mob. Commoners like us have little power. Sure we can vote 'the lesser of two evils' but at the end of the day, both are on the payroll of the real people in power. Hong Kong is in the same spot in that they want 'Democratic' elections. China said 'we don't care who you pick as long as they are both in the tank for China'. 
So, there is little incentive to get people out of banks and into anything else for adoption. People care about graft, bribes, money, kickbacks. I have a credit card because I get 2% cash back on all purchases. With Bitcoin I have to spend 1% to transfer to fiat and then buy something. Plus, banks have got so much money and power that they can easily launch a secret smear campaign against crypto and have the bankroll to pay for it. Bitcoin has zero marketing budget. Bitcoin has little in terms of ways to advertise itself. 
Remember, we don't have 'free' healthcare not because of the people, we don't have free healthcare because the people in power don't want it.

That's why Bitcoin is useless because you have to pay 1% to the exchange, and the payment processors want their cut, so they will still have a 2%-3% cut to handle it because 'money'.

Lol no. But I keep hearing these 'sky is falling' people talking about the end of the world. 
If there is one thing I DO know about all of this, is that it won't be bitcoin. Here is why:
Humans, typically have big egos, and like to control every.little.thing. So if the currency of the USA suddenly had a massive global falling, which will happen one day, the top minds in the banking and financial sectors will join forces to come up with a new plan to fix the problem. Nobody will say 'let's use bitcoin'. If anything, they will create their own coin. Could you imagine if the US Government suddenly decided to abandon all banks? Countries around the globe would go into mass chaos and rebellion. You and I know that it will not happen like that. At no point will banking regulators and the US Government decided to convert their cash into an electronic form of currency that is global.

Tell me, what is bitcoin's purpose? AND, how do you suppose an electronic currency, with zero advertising budget, is going to get people to switch when Apple Pay and Google Pay can't even do it? It's not going to be adopted by the masses. Ever. That's why it keeps falling. It's a red herring, a rouse. It's a great idea ahead of it's time.
@_date: 2018-12-12 19:28:58
First of all, I love your passion. I too, would love to own one bitcoin. However, There still has been zero evidence to support it's use or going up.
1. People have shitty phones. Even with all the money Apple and Google has spent on advertising Apple Pay and GooglePay, most people still intentionally don't use it, especially when it gives one more level of potential hacking. I would completely agree that bitcoin use will be adopted if Google/Apple pay actually made any kind of dent in electronic payments. Vendors rarely take it, which means, you STILL need a piece of plastic to pay for stuff. Hell there are still little old ladies that write checks. CHECKS! WTF. Heck, businesses write checks all the time still, as does the Government. So, adopting Bitcoin as a payment system, at least in the USA, is not likely any time soon. Oops, my phone battery just died.. brb I have to go plug it in so I can pay for something.... 
2. Just like Religion, there is little reason why one coin is better than any other. Does the fact there are more muslims in the world than Christians mean people should switch? Because Bitcoin is popular, should people dump altcoins and only buy Bitcoin? It's a tough argument.
3. In order for Bitcoin to be worth something, my neighbor has to want it enough for me to sell mine to him. it's not like gold, where globally we all agree in gold's value. We would all have to agree that something 'digital' can hold a value. 
4. The Chinese are printing American $100 bills and counterfitting them all the time. They could just go to casinos, cash it for real 100's and then buy as much bitcoin as they want. The USA-CIA could equally print money in secret, and fluctuate the market as wildly as they want. Because it's open to manipulation because currencies are open to manipulation, there is a hard sell for most of us. It's different with gold, because you can buy gold with fake money, and you STILL have gold. With bitcoin, you don't really have anything but a promise of worth. 
5. Banks are 'too big to fail'. We have seen this already in the USA. Too Big to fail. 
So, as I hope Bitcoin gets to the $1500 price so I can own one as a novelty in case pigs fly, but in the meantime I will sit quietly on the side and root for guys like you because you deserve to make millions. If there is anything a guy likes is to see a change of power from one group of wealthy people in control, to another group of wealthy people in control.
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:19:37
The difference is that INSIDE the USA, I pay rent in USD. No matter what the value differential is overseas, my employer still pays me in USD and I forward that money onto my landlord who forwards it on to the banks. That's not going to change. Ever. 
Outside the USA, the money can certainly get weaker/stronger against foreign markets. If the US Dollar tanks, all those countries who purchased our debt (China) will also tank too. All level 1 economies have some US Debt and will also be affected. Global economies will all suffer, which is why I am not immediately worried. Long term, sure, it could very well happen. If it did the USA would print money, or get bailed out by George Sauros and Warren Buffet. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 15:14:25
Yes, people are allowed differing opinions. Let's take home automation. Two years ago, you could argue that home automation was the way of the future with NEST™ and that in the future everyone would just use their phones to turn on and off lights. Clearly, that's not going to happen because people live in 100 year old houses and aren't about to spend all kinds of money to rewire anything. They also said in 1985 we would have flying cars by 2018. We can't even get self driving cars approved, let alone flying cars. 
Now, about Bitcoin, I like your concept of a borderless currency like gold. Basically, this is a digital form of gold as gold is borderless and we theoretically use gold as the standard globally. So we are converting from USD to Gold to Yen. Instead we convert from USD to bitcoin to Yen. In your argument, why don't we just have Bitcoin at both ends also, so there is no conversion? Sounds great right? Well we can't do that. Countries NEED fiat to exist. They need the ability to generate money for infrastructure and defense, and in order to do that they print fiat. If suddenly everyone hid their fiat, they would just print more. If everyone hid their bitcoin, countries, and the global economy, would collapse. This is what is really scary. 
Now, let's say you have both. This is what we have now, and it doesn't really work. Contracts are written 30 years out with banks, that they are to be paid in fiat for the mortgages. So, no matter what happens with bitcoin, people still need to use fiat for 30 years. So, knowing we will have fiat for 30 years, also means that there will need to also be government backed banks. Therefore people's payroll will most likely also need to be in fiat. Now, I don't know if you have any loans like student loans or car payments, but if 50% of your net income has to be paid in fiat, chances are you won't want to get paid in bitcoin and then pay a conversion fee to switch it over to USD to pay your loans. It will be a pain in the ass to do the extra step. 
Anyways, i am open to debate this further but I honestly feel that 'Bitcoiners' (those people with no concept of the real world) are waiving their magic harry potter wands thinking that little old ladies who still write checks are suddenly going to give up their fiat and pay with their iPhone 10s. There are so many layers to payments in the US at least, that fiat will never go away, and as long as fiat is the dominant coin of the realm for day to day stuff, that even if Bitcoin was dominant on the internet, and you can use either fiat or bitcoin, why take the extra step? Just use fiat because it's easier. 
Remember, no matter how amazing or great a system is you build, you always have to assume that it will be ruled or used by the lowest common denominator of people in terms of adoption and use.

I was told they can sell 'ghost' coins for, say $3,000, to drive the price down, hoping it falls to say, $2000 and then buy back the same coins. Especially if let's say, it's over a weekend or something.. they can sell ghost coins.

Given that apple pay and google pay failed, Bitcoin pay is also doomed to fail. 
You have to remember, that in order for Bitcoin to really succeed, it needs to be adopted by 80 year old ladies in places like Milwaukee. They are the bottom of the list, and the ones most important. Knowing that they still write checks, leads me to believe that we are in for a very long wait on adoption. Because of this fact, by the time Bitcoin actually gets any legs and steam, something new and better will come along. The blockchain backbone will stay but in a different magnitude than we see now. I can see the ACH (clearing house for banks) coming up with a banking blockchain (which they already sort-of have now) in which there is no more ACH and payments inbetween banks are more instant instead of the 24-48 hours things take to clear, but honestly it's gotten much better with things like Cash App in which I can transfer money instantly for free. There is little incentive when there is tech that is very close to bitcoin already out there. I am not saying bitcoin isn't better, because it is. But it's like, if I said to you you have to drive an extra 10 minutes to save $2 per gas tank when you fill it up, most people won't go the 10 minutes. Same with bitcoin. Sure it might cost 1% more to convert, and an extra step, but what are you really getting in return over fiat? Not much.

Yea, banks lose a lot in chargebacks, but they also get interest from loaning money to people, and make money on fees from vendors. Everyone keeps talking about banks folding, but banks will always be needed to keep governments running. Checks are obsolete, and debit cards could be obsolete if everyone had apple pay (which they won't)
This boils down to having a PHONE on you at all times that works, or some kind of swiper credit card with a qr code on it for bitcoin. 
It's just too complicated.
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:55:49
Yea, think about 'adoption' basically means you expect me to pay with my phone. Yea, not a good strategy. My phone battery dies, screen cracks, and has problems, and you want me to tie my bank account or bitcoin account to it? People lose phones all the time. That's a bad idea. That's why Apple pay hasn't really made any headway. Bitcoin is not going to make any headway either.

I agree phones are attached to us, but also, phones break very easy. Phone batteries die. I just can't see anyone solely relying on their phone.

Just remember one thing:
Under President Reagan, he ordered Oliver North to sell crack cocaine to US Citizens to raise money to fund the Iran Contra Affair. 
Don't think for a minute that agents can raise money to short bitcoin, pump/dump or manipulate in any multitude of ways. Especially if, given that USD and the banking industry, are tied hand in hand, that any 'threat' to banks is also a 'threat' to national security. Everyone talks about taking control away from governments, and that is treasonous. So, if banks don't want bitcoin, they will use everything in their power to short it out of existence.

Thank you for this well written argument. You are like one out of 100 that post in the sub. Most people write gibberish. 
Plastic credit cards is easy. Relying on cell phones is a bad idea for now. If cell phone batteries and screens get better, then electronic currency like Apple Pay and Bitcoin Pay MIGHT become good. However, I really think it will take 20 years for this to be a real thing, and by that time, something new is bound to come along. "Retina Pay" in which you just look into a scanner with your eye to pay. It will still link your bank account to another bank account.
Bitcoin's biggest thing is being able to buy something from another country at whatever rate it's trading at. But it's not stable. So, if I buy for .40 bitcoin right now, by 5pm I could have lost half my money. The lack of stability makes it a terrible thing to use as a coin. For inside the country, fiat will still be king, as I will get paid in fiat, and pay rent in fiat because banks and the government will want fiat also. So there is no incentive to really switch. There really isn't. There is not enough of a benefit to the day to day person to pay extra to use bitcoin. Maybe in 20 years, but again, by then there will be some altcoin (based on bitcoin like BluRay is based on LaserDisc) that will advance the technology further. 
I love the romanticism of bitcoin and have owned some, but I just don't think we are really ready yet. I still feel like we are the same place 5 years ago.. a lot of people talking about it and how cool it is, but no real use for the day to day person.

I believe that the rise to 20k was it was the 'fad' and the 'buzz' on the street. It hit it's tipping point with the rich elite. "Did you hear about this new thing called cryptocurrency?" Suddenly everyone buys in. Just like the early internet days when people spent millions for a .com address. It was stupid money, and that's what last December was. 
Now people know what crypto is, and that it merely is an experiment in technology. Technology changes month to month. Tech investments rise and fall lightning fast. Apple has a new iPhone every year otherwise it's stock sinks because there is no buzz on the street. 
Believing in Bitcoin is like Believing in Jesus. You want to believe, but suddenly you learn about all these other religions (coins) and you start to wonder why this one over all the others. Then you do more research and find out that in order to actually BUY anything with bitcoin you have to pay MORE money to convert your cash into bitcoin. This extra step, for a lazy person, is too much work. Plus you have to have your phone on you. Screens break, batteries die. It's unreliable. Nothing about Bitcoin makes any sense in the day to day world. It's like socialism looking good on paper, but in reality is just awful.

Just to argue your point, I can go to China, and own printing presses, and print US Fiat, pay HSBC to fly to China and load the plane full of money (as they did with Drug Cartels) and fly back to the USA and launder that money into the bank, and then buy and dump bitcoin over and over and over. The cash is fake; printed fiat; used to alter the currency price. 
Now, let's remove me from the Equation. Let's say there is a duplicate press the CIA is operating in secret. Let's say the CIA is also partnering with the Winklevoss Brothers to sell faux currency to drive it lower, only to buy it back, creating a net sum of zero btc but also shorting the price and making money. It's being manipulated all.the.time. by governments and private investors. It's no different. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 01:44:23
Let's be real here. Until bitcoin is "better" than the system we have now, it won't be used.
1. Does bitcoin offer 2% cash back?
2. Does bitcoin cost the same as fiat for purchases? (no, I have to pay a fee to buy bitcoin and then go buy the exact same thing).
3. If my bitcoin is hacked, is it insured by the bank? No. 
And yet all of Reddit says I am stupid because I am saving money by using fiat and Bitcoin can't compete - YET. One day, maybe, but not anytime soon. Remember, it's 10 years old, and the price is only $3700 and it's adoption as a currency is minimal at best. Not even 1% of the worldwide vendors adopt it.

So basically you are saying it's like a million to one odds of it succeeding as a currency, especially since nobody is using it as a currency now, but rather only HODLing it. 99% of the buyers bought it for the idea that they could make money off of it. Lambo dreamers. They are not going to spend or use it. There is no case to pay a fee to transfer to bitcoin from dollars solely for the purpose of using bitcoin. If anything it's an annoyance and there is a fee. I just love the concept, but it is based on the notion that 'too big to fail' banks will actually fail. I just don't know how that can happen on a global scale.

OK. 
So, fiat is the coin of the realm. This means, that no matter what happens outside the USA, my pay, and rent, are due in fiat. That will never change. 
We can't 'wean ourselves' off of government money because that, in itself, is treason. 
MtGox was hacked/stolen, so I am not so sure how good fiat-btc exchanges really are. 
If you google the amount of people who accept apple pay and google pay, it's very very small out of the global marketplace of those who accept plastic of some sort. In fact, I think it's much less than 10%. Bitcoin is less than 0.1 %. I think if google pay or apple pay reached a 70% market dominance amongst VENDORS then I would tend to agree that _maybe_ bitcoin has a shot at gaining support for payment processors. But remember, payment processors are really banks, and the price of bitcoin is changing by the second, so it makes it even harder for a vendor to accept btc. 
I have followed all of the arguments relating to Bitcoin. It's like Socialism or Communism. On paper, it sounds amazing, but in practice, it doesn't work. I think Bitcoin _may_ eventually become more adopted, but honestly the fact we still have little old ladies writing checks makes me think it will be 50 years before the end of plastic swipers, if it even comes to an end. 
Banks and governments are often one and the same, and everyone reads the white papers and talks about 'during the end of the world, only bitcoin will still be around'. Now, I was here during Sandy, and guess what? There was no debit/credit/electronic nothing. It was fiat or trade. Bitcoin, in a place like Puerto Rico, is worthless. Fiat is worth everything. So, let's talk about this 'end of the world'. 
Everyone says 'when countries like Venezuela collapse'. Ok, so, how's their internet and cell service when countries collapse? Do businesses still have infrastructure? Do they still have high speed internet, or does that collapse as people begin to revolt? I have to think it's like Puerto Rico, that when things fall apart, the internet is the first thing to go. That rules out things like credit/debit/Bitcoin.

As someone who is NOT a troll, but a hater of lies and stupid people, whenever people honestly believe that banks and governments will collapse and appoint bitcoin as their savior I have to step in and point out how the ACH, the bank clearing house, could easily come up with their own global bank sponsored coin that would charge 3% transaction fees, but ALSO come with hack protection, 2% cash back on purchases, and benefits and it would crust the alt-coins and possibly bitcoin too. Bitocoin is only doing as well as it is because banks are _Allowing_ it. They are just slowly watching... the moment it gets too powerful, governments will step in globally, and change it.

If Bitcoin never gets above $6,000 is it a success or failure? 
And what I mean by this, is that many of you look it as a way to make money. Some of you see it as an experiment. Some of you see it as a currency. 
What is the definition of failure _for you_? This means, if you buy in at $3700, and it goes to $30,000 and then back to $3700 a year later, you are net sum zero. If your money makes you no money as compared to what a stock market investment would give you (like a fund, CD, IRA, or something with a low return), is it a failure for you? And if so, how long would you hold it if you have a net sum of zero? A year? 5 years? How long would you HODL before you consider it a loss of your profit potential?

Nah. Still unlikely. What you are asking is for Bitcoin to replace gold, not fiat or currency. 
Think about this.
The United States needs a way to fund itself. So, it prints money. Debt Dollars that are not backed by anything other than people who share a belief in making America great. (no pun intended). So, they build infrastructure with debt dollars; they build weapons for debt dollars; they build homes and jails for debt dollars that can be traded for food. 
Now, if the country absolved fiat, how would it generate wealth to do things? They would have to print bonds backed by bitcoin; essentially a promise to pay. I can't see that happening. 
Plus, based on some algorithim, eventually ALL of bitcoin would get lost by paper wallets, glitches, or solar flares.

They already have raised the bar, when if I buy something online at Amazon with my Citi™Bank Mastercard I get 2% cash back and no interest if I pay on time. If I pay with Bitcoin, not only is it an extra step in my online purchase process, but I have ZERO protection because once my money is transferred, it's gone, AND it costs me more because I have to pay the exchange 1% to convert. So, really, there is zero point for me to ever use Bitcoin, no matter how many Geniuses tell me to.

Ok. There is zero incentive for anyone to stockpile Bitcoins. If the USA bans it, and labels it 'terroristic' or something, nobody anywhere will use it if the USA 'spins/brands' it as such. Imagine if Starbucks took that 'terror currency Bitcoin'. Yea that will just go over really well. 
I could see Amazon creating their own shitcoin called the A-Coin that you can essentially only buy stuff on Amazon with. Because of the massive size of Amazon, there is value as it then has some sense of merchandise value to it. We could be trading in A-coins right now. But even with that, fiat will never go away. banks are too big to fail, which means that if banks even felt threatened a little, they will respond by over-regulating bitcoin for tax reasons, and then the entire point of having a non-bank currency will be moot.

Bitcoin is complicated.
You have to pay a FEE to buy something to you already can buy for the non-fee price. Plus, I get 2% cash back when I use my Citi™ DoubleCash card. So why would I choose to not get 2% cash back, and pay the conversion fee? It makes absolutely zero sense to 99% of the people I talk to. Plus, once I DID convert to BTC AND pay a FEE, I then have to SEARCH to see if the vendor even takes it, which they usually don't. 
It's just not worth it. It's like Apple Pay... too much work, not enough reward. 
Make all Bitcoin purchases 25% off list price, and then I will put the time into owning bitcoin. But businesses often run on razor thin margins, so 25% off is a lot of profits lost.

I absolutely hope it becomes as great as people say, however the whole concept of stripping power from governments is inherently a bad idea in that countries need fiat. Could you imagine what would happen if there was a global currency? There would be even more rich at the top owning it all. Plus, what if, hypothetically, there is a massive solar flare event, effectively destroying 99% of electronic stuff. It would render it useless as coins would be 'lost'. It's just not as reliable as gold, and then the fiat of a particular country. Could you imagine if tomorrow you woke up and the trillions of wealth Warren Buffet has ran on equal ground with the people of Venezuela? They would be poor forever. You generate wealth in a country with debt-dollars: printed fiat to create essentially loans and wealth to build infrastructure.

I have yet to meet anyone who ONLY uses GooglePay and doesn't bring their debit/credit card. What happens if you have to pay a toll, or tip someone? What fantasy world do you live in? It's like Tesla drivers being able to drive across the USA. Sure, you can but only if you are willing to take THEIR ROUTE via charging stations across the country. Same with Google Pay. You are still very limited (in the US, but maybe not Europe) to where you can go.

Point is that you do all of that because you need to.
The whole idea of Bitcoin is to be bank free and do everything from your phone, and yet you can't get a mortgage with bitcoin, or get a car loan with bitcoin. You need banks and the banking industry to determine your wealth. You need credit and credit cards to determine your 'worthyness'. Those things will never go away. For those reasons alone, Bitcoin will never 'dominate' but merely be 'an accessory'.

Yea, so it's basically worthless? Unlike, say gold, which still has a value

According to Reddit, it was 0.001 like ten years ago, so they are still rich.

All of the stuff you mention are 'bank' stuff, not 'people stuff' 
Until it's 'people stuff', people won't care to use bitcoin or buy bitcoin. 
Remember, there is massive amounts of advertising dollars spent by banks to get you to deposit your fiat into their accounts. Also, this money is insured by the FDIC, unlike Mt Gox. Also, I get 2% cash back when I use my Citi™ Mastercard. SO, really, banking is better than bitcoin.
With bitcoin, I have to take time to use the interwebs to get an account. It took three weeks to get a gemini account. Then, I had to pay a fee to buy, and a fee to sell. If I was buying bitcoin to spend it, I would essentially be paying extra for the same things I am buying now. I would be paying MORE for things with bitcoin, and there is no cash back, no insurance against hacking. 
Bitcoin is like communism. It looks good in theory, and on paper, but in reality, it's not that great for the masses to adopt it.

I will be getting paid in fiat for the next ten years and pay rent in fiat the next ten years

Part 1: Bernie Sanders Effect. 
You see, during the presidential election, pro Sanders Trolls (probably Russian Bots) said things like "Bernie speaks my language and I love his platform so much that I would have his offspring". The comments like this were so crazy that most of us educated people got turned off by moronic comments like this. 
People came here and said the most bizarre stuff they read in some paper or youtube video, with ZERO understanding of how human beings think or work. Apple pay is still a failure, as is google pay. Bitcoin pay will not suddenly come along and outpace both of them as a payment means or payment system. Why? Banks give cash back, banks often take the hit when accounts are hacked. Banks provide insurance and offer services and peace of mind. People got turned off by the lies and nonsense many bitcoiners shouted from within these digital walls.
Part 2.
Let's say that MOST people are actually smart (they aren't). But let's say they are. Let's say that bitcoin pay is a technically better way to pay - in theory. But let's look at the reality. Do phones break? Yup. So bitcoin pay is not reliable. Do internets drop out? Yup. Bitcoin is not reliable. Do credit cards go down when the internet is out? Yup, and if credit cards go down, so does Bitcoin Pay. So, really, credit cards is still the preferred method of payment. Debit too. And, here is the real kicker. People are SO incredibly LAZY that honestly, nobody in Milwaukee Wisconson with a high school education is going to pay EXTRA to buy bitcoin to pay for the same purchase they could pay for with a credit card (2% back) or debit card. I know, 'but what about buying stuff from China' is the counter argument. Well, that's like 1% of 1% actually buy stuff from those type websites. Most of the people in Milwaukee don't. There is zero incentive for them to use Bitcoin Pay, Apple Pay, or Google Pay. There is zero reason for Bitcoin to be adopted other than some revolutionary concept. But mind you, people know that shopping at WalMart hurts american jobs, but they still go there. Same with banks and debit cards. 
Part 3.
Now if you are still reading, Kudos. Blockchain is amazing technology, and Blockchain technology will never die. It will be reborn like a phoenix into the banking sector and become something amazing. Just as LaserDisc got reborn into Blu-Ray, so will BlockChain Technology. Humans are just not ready for a global currency. We are still believing in fictional dieties from the sky. 
Part 4.
Is Christianity correct over, say Buddhist? Is Muslim beliefs correct over Christianity? So many teachings of different things and so many teachings that are similar. Same with Alt-Coins. Why use Bitcoin over Litecoin? Why not use Amazon-Coin? If there was ever a global currency, Amazon should be the one to name it. There is _only_ market domination and that's it. 
Part 5.
Where does the FIAT go?  Seriously. When you buy Bitcoin, what are you actually buying? I think the fiat actually goes to bitcoin, sort of. It really goes from your hand, right over to the gas and electric company of the person who mined that bitcoin. You are essentially handing money right to the power company, and a few people along the way are going to give you a receipt called 'bitcoin' that has no value unless you can convince your neighbors it does. You don't have to convince your neighbors to use fiat, because fiat is used everywhere globally. Bitcoin is used almost nowhere, and only has value when people believe in it. Fiat is used everywhere not because people believe in it, but because it's the accepted coin of the realm.

Why would anyone adopt it? Governments don't want, and banks don't want it. Really, they are the ones who control the taxes and business licenses globally, and really, they can just levy a tax against it if it ever becomes a threat. 
I personally would love it if BTC became the 'internet currency', and then the US Government can pass an 'Internet Tax' where if anything is paid with BTC on the internet, an 8% sales tax is levied. It's honestly where it will eventually have to go, and that money distributed to the states.

Well, it did go to 2999 on Gemini.com.. so it technically did drop to 3k.

It's been 4 years since Apple pay began. People, including old ladies and businesses, still cut checks. 
Now, assuming Amazon accepts bitcoin, that's probably at least 70% of online sales (guessing) and I bet if they accept bitcoin, it STILL wouldn't be 1% of their gross online sales. 
There is zero reason for someone who is middle class or higher, to make the switch.

It's only less expensive right now. Eventually there needs to be some kind of scam insurance against buyers and sellers. This scam insurance costs money, and therefore there needs to be a 3% fee. The bank processing fee isn't only for fraud. In fact, I bet that fraud is only a tiny fraction of where that money goes. It goes to administrative costs, advertising, marketing, and some kind of protection incase of broken items, lost items, or other issues. With American Express, they can actually take the money back from a vendor if the vendor does something considered shady. With bitcoin, they can't. All of that costs money, and hence the 3%. Everyone is merely focusing on what they want to see, and not the big picture. It's like, when 3D Printing suddenly became popular, every internet kid in a garage said "I can build and sell 3D printers for less than others" and they rushed out to make websites. Suddenly they realized that they had to charge what everyone else charges because purchasers lie, vendors give broken parts sometimes, there is insurance you need, advertising costs, rent, etc.   I feel Bitcoin is a lot like that in that people say 'it will be less than 3%' and that may be true, but not by much. And if you get it to 2.5%, that might be millions for the WalMarts but for the mom n pop, that's not enough for them to really make the switch.

Not trying to shit post, but I still haven't heard a good reason for WHY, right now, instead of paying for things with my Citibank™ DoubleCash card, I should instead convert my fiat to bitcoin to buy the exact same thing. 
Now, when I say good reason, I am not talking about 'freeing our society from the clutches of evil banks or governments'. Instead, I am looking for a solid reason why the average unintelligent human being would actively setting up a bitcoin account to buy the same thing they are already buying? And no, that one guy who buys 3D printers from AliBaba who can't use paypal doesn't count. I am talking about the masses. There just doesn't seem to be a solid reason to buy things with bitcoin when you can buy the same things with fiat. (Again I am not talking about the white papers, long term benefits against inflation; I am talking about the average mom and pop in Milwaukee: what's in it for them?

Exactly it is an experiment in stupidity in which Warren Buffet can own all the bitcoin and the world.

Exactly. Bitcoin is just like MySpace. It will revolutionize social media!
