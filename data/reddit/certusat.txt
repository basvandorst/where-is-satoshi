That is fucked.
Instead of paying 3$ now to get my coffee now, I pay 30$ NOW to get a 3$ coffee 10 times spread over however many days.
If you did that with a lot of businesses you'd have a shit ton of upfront cost. So I need a cosigned wallet with my starbucks, the 3 different chains I go to for groceries. The snack shop I sometimes eat at, the restaurants I sometimes eat at the clothing store I sometimes use and the list goes on. This solution is fucked.
If the whole point of bitcoin is to replace or be an alternative to normal money, it needs to do what normal money does even better, or there is no reason to adopt it.

Got any information on a technical level how that's suppose to work? If all lightning networks are based on co-signed wallets how would that even work.
So I open one with starbucks, and starbucks has one with MacDs. So now I can pay at MacDs because I pay starbucks 2$ in our co-signed wallet and starbucks will pay MacDs 2$ in their co-signed wallet.
Is that how it's supposed to work? Why would starbucks do that for me? Why would any company do that for their customers without expecting something in return.
More likely a big company will crop up, let's call them knab. So Knab lets me open a co-signed wallet with them and will handle all the transactions with other businesses because they also have co-signed wallets with them in exchange for some monthly fees. Kind of like a bank. And because they are so good at what they do and necessary everyone will have their money with Knab or a similar firm. You are just literally re-inventing money, only that your's is super energy inefficient and fucking slow.
Because let's not forget just because you can offload a bunch of transactions onto the lightning network, to settle and actually transfer money you still need to do it on the slow as fuck blockchain. So every time somebody cashes out our re-loads their lightning wallet you need to do it on the blockchain and 7 transactions, 14, 28, 100 or 1000 per second will not be enough to handle that for a whole country.

But it does create centralization. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:26:41
So what, There is one big co-signed wallet between 100000 costumers and 200 businesses? How again is that different or better than what visa does right now?
Literally love the idea of a de-centralized non-goverment controlled currency, but it just seems like every step bitcoin makes towards mainstream viability turns it into a shittier version of what we already have.

No. I got interested, looked into it and didn't find anything great about it.

I've never in my adult life had the issue that I couldn't buy what I wanted to buy. (besides Illegal material)
I have the feeling if that's the line you use to sell bitcoin, it's a pretty poor pitch. I yet to see anyone explain to me why the average European should use bitcoin instead of the euro.
@_date: 2018-04-08 13:03:41
Can you elaborate what the value is? I don't see why a normal European should switch to bitcoin instead of using the euro.
@_date: 2018-04-07 22:30:46
No, I don't see any value in them.
@_date: 2018-04-08 00:00:02
Yeah, so like I said. Moving "large" amounts of money between accounts that normally can't do that. Hopefully for them there isnÄt a lot of time between turning it into bitcoin and back into fiat again or they could lose a lot of money, which would be devastating for people that need it.
Good for the people that need it, shame on the people that abuse it. However, that still makes it completely useless for most people that actually have money to spend freely.

A tank is a very powerful tool as well, but owning one has absolutely no utility to the average person. As long as bitcoin doesn't actually do something for the average person, I don't see the value in it.
@_date: 2018-04-07 21:00:40
What problems does bitcoin actually solve right now besides maybe moving large amounts of money between accounts that normally aren't able to do that?
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:16:55
What does that have to do with anything? Can't you answer a simple question?
@_date: 2018-04-07 23:34:03
I understand how bitcoin works and how the blockchain works, I just don't see any value specifically in bitcoin or any of the altcoins at the moment.
@_date: 2018-04-08 22:27:31
I hope one day you realize what fucking nonsense you are saying right now. Cause it makes no fucking sense to start babbling about supply and demand when I simply asked why Europeans should switch from using the euro to using bitcoin.

I enjoy browsing reddit and sometimes I pop into the crypto subreddits to see if there's something new.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:34:53
I agree completely.
I tried to understand what a bitcoin is, who makes it, who ownes it, who guarantees its value how to access it, but after 30 min of reading I got bored. 
I don't think I want to use a technology so niche and so complicated if I can just use real money o_O
€: Oh and for some perspective, I've been using computers basically all my live and I'm currently employed as a programmer. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:23:12
You are right. I didn't think of that while writing my previous reply. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:19:55
If it was a commodity with real value like food, or metal, yes.
But since it's a currency it's only useful if it can be used, if it is so expensive to buy in to the market less people will do it, which means less companies have a incentive to include bitcoin as a option which means bitcoin will lose value.
