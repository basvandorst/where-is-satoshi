Could you have sent it to the wrong address?
For example, did you send your BTC to your Ledger’s Legacy or Segwit address? People make mistakes, so I would not be too concerned, as you can usually resolve the issue. I once accidentally sent my ETH to my ETC address, but was able to recover it quite easily with a quick Google search.

It usually takes about 10-15 minutes.

I think the real question is how much the price has already been manipulated by institutional investors, as well as folks who have no idea what BTC represents/is (and have a quick trigger to sell).

The wild crashes are exactly what I am talking about... I was curious about getting the opinions of others in our community, with full knowledge that no one knows...

Absolutes are not helpful. The only crash may not be to the moon... at least not yet.

I want some BTC Black Friday prices!

To me, a crash will be 20-40% correction, which includes a drop from $13.5 to $9k.

Nope - I am hodling until mainstream adoption or bust. No FUD. I would just like an opportunity for people to share their opinions on a (short-term - e.g. less than a year) potential crash before BTC inevitably goes up again. In other words, see history.

All of the above, but it starts somewhere. Whether it's Amazon support, Wal-Mart support, ability to pay taxes, et cetera...
Mainstream adoption would be an ability to use BTC as a means of exchange for something that millions of people do on a daily basis.

You're right. I have no idea. No one does... BUT you can assign probabilities to potential outcomes based on the information available... Having said that, do you think it is more likely for BTC to hit $100K, then drop to $1K, or for BTC to hit $13.5K, then drop to $9K, then go back up, et cetera... just chalk talk.

Are we getting them in January?
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:22:49
Fingers crossed!

Not really. Just want to start a realistic discussion. No one knows what the future holds, but it does no harm discussing it.

I agree with you wholeheartedly. 
I think BTC right now is susceptible to price manipulation from institutional investors and noobs. Consequently, I expect a 35 to 50% correction at some point in the next 18 months. 
Big whale investors are likely driving the price up (i.e. buying BTC) to eventually time a sell-off to make big money on their short positions. Double-dip profits. 
Nevertheless, I believe BTC will recover, although the process could wash, rinse, repeat, as it has in the pass (e.g. 2013). At the end of the day though, various governments' regulation and mainstream adoption will determine BTC's future. I am hopeful due to South Korea and Japan, among some other countries, but no one knows...

Gauging expectations: Anyone expect BTC to dip below $2,000 again?
