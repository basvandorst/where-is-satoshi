Phew, at least nothing will change!

Yes, the bot  was turned off for roughly a month, unfortunately I do not have a screen shot of it.  I do on the other hand have a screen shot of when the bot was turned back on for a short period of time after that:
As you can see despite falling traffic, subscribers per day just randomly increases drastically.  The bot you are talking about ran for a very long period of time.  Likely half of the subscribers to are completely fake.  Even the mods admit this.

So calling this article's author out on his lies makes me emotional and implies I have lost money?  Ok then....

Uhh stocks have IPOs and property has previous value.  They don't start at 0 and are concentrated in the hands of a few thousand people.  Wealth distribution for bitcoin is absolutely terrible, worse than anything in the world.
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:54:10


Sounds exactly like most of the people that follow bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-05 21:21:01
In what world is this a valid response?  
@_date: 2015-12-24 23:29:26
Visa does that every day.  Twice a day.

I think what OP meant to say is: "How can this non-existent software operate successfully on this other non-existent software which requires soft forks to the bitcoin protocol which are also currently non-existent?"

Isn't evading bans against the Reddit TOS?  If you were banned for vote manipulation, why are you back here?  Why should we believe a word you say, seeing as how you were already banned for trying to sway public opinion? 
@_date: 2015-12-27 22:56:18
How can OB have support for something that doesn't even exist?

Purse.io comes to mind in context of active scams commonly upvoted.
@_date: 2015-12-08 15:21:21
So outside of needing over $500 after 5pm, all of your other reasons are illegal activities?  Can you see why mass adoption isn't happening yet?
@_date: 2015-12-08 04:54:04
No it has not.  
@_date: 2015-12-08 14:39:18
That is exactly how top comments work, you are completely wrong.  What you are describing is how "best" comments are ranked.  Top = most upvotes.  Best = algorithm.

Yup.  They had to stop offering gift cards through their service because Amazon kept cancelling the gift card because it was purchased with a stolen credit card.  Amazon can not cancel physical purchases once shipped, so purse.io can keep scamming Amazon until they figure out a way to ban them.

Realistically if Coinbase released MAU figures their user count would be measured in thousands not millions.  And since they are the biggest bitcoin company out there by far, any MAU numbers they release would reflect very poorly across the entire ecosystem.  It would pretty much prove what most skeptics already think:  almost nobody actually uses bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-08 14:52:15
Which is why it has attracted so little people around the world.  There's absolutely no reason to use it outside of an obscure political ideology (libertarianism). 
@_date: 2015-12-24 21:17:33
You can make believe whatever you want, but the fact is bitcoin is unlike any stock, currency or commodity.  Bitcoin is just a cheap pump and dump scheme which is manipulated and thrown around by clever/shady people to transfer wealth from gullible ideological libertarians like yourself.  It's revolutionary in the sense that prior to bitcoin, get rich quick schemes, pyramid schemes, and pump and dump schemes were limited to geographical areas and centralized/open to prosecution.  Bitcoin is a decentralized community driven scam that's hard to shut down.  The predatory community took a cool tech experiment that was supposed to be digital cash and turned it into a blended version of age old scams.
@_date: 2015-12-28 05:32:26
You're right they don't.  But the very fact that not a single bitcoin company has done this is very telling by itself.  Look at how much bitcoin companies like to brag using useless metrics like user count and percentage of growth.  However, they never actually give real solid numbers.

That's just blatantly misleading, but luckily someone keeps track of these things for times like this.  The only two months prior to January 2015 where traffic here dropped into the 600s range was 690,000 and 680,000.  A far cry from your statement.
Face it, traffic to this sub has been dropping like a rock.
@_date: 2015-12-05 19:43:13
That's because they haven't.  The entire article is a one giant lie:
@_date: 2015-12-30 13:32:27
There are 160k transactions per day average.  50% of those transactions are $1 or less.  Which leaves us at 80k transactions that aren't just pennies being slung around.  Which puts it at 2.4 million transactions per month.  If you figure a user consists of someone who sends a transaction per month, then there are 2.4 million at best.  I'd look at that as a generous number, the actual amount is likely less.
@_date: 2015-11-30 19:15:07


No, genius.  As I said, they sold all of their crypto after realizing how dumb it was to hold it in the first place.
@_date: 2015-11-25 17:30:05
And all you have to do is subject yourself to credit card fraud!

Even if that were true, all that means is bitcoin is unnecessary to allow Google to pay to index sites.
@_date: 2015-11-28 14:09:38
Nope, even sites that are currently pay walled today have specific code in their website to allow Google in for free.  Like I said, there will literally be 0 people willing to do away with the free advertising that Google is providing.
@_date: 2015-11-30 19:43:27
Even worse:  in 2038 when these 8 gig blocks would roll around, it would allow bitcoin to have 30,000 TPS. 
Visa can do 56,000.  Right now.  Visa also improves their network to the tune of roughly 10,000 per year as well, so by 2038 Visa will be well over 100,000 TPS.

At first I was giving him the benefit of the doubt at just being excited about his product.  But after this statement I have to wonder if he's just flat out scamming venture capitalists at this point.
As a webmaster, I completely rely on Google for my traffic.  Nearly all of it comes from Google, and without them I would close down immediately.  It's a symbiotic relationship, and I would never in a million years even consider charging Google to index my site.  I design my site to be Google friendly based on their recommendations.  I consult Matt Cutt's blog for the latest industry standards to appease Google.  I am Google's bitch, not the other way around.
This guy's "vision" of bitcoin must have occurred after some serious experiments on Silk Road 3 because there are 0 webmasters who would have the balls to charge Google to index their site.

That also ignores the fact that Coinbase takes a 1% fee.  It's definitely a great example of how bitcoin is not cheaper for remittances like everyone touted.  The owner of one of the biggest bitcoin remittance companies rebit.ph [stated that bitcoin was simply not cheaper]( a couple months ago, but of course that link was downvoted on this sub.  No bad news allowed of course.
The only way bitcoin will ever be cheaper than traditional remittance methods is if everyone in the world used bitcoin, which is simply not reality.
