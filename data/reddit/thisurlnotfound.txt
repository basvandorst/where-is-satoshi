So if you're BTC rich and not ISK/USD rich you can get game time.

True, I did not realize Amazon sold PLEX.

Well, in all fairness, BFL hopes it will produce little heat.  As far as any of us know, there's not an actual working unit and therefore no real numbers.
That said, assuming the unit lives up to what has been promised by BFL, then it should get no warmer than a cell phone.

Break 50?  Sure, but I think it'll dance around it today.  If it does hit 50, it will not go much higher (today at least).

While I am on the pre-order list for the Jalapeno, I am actually not holding my breath for 4.5GH/s.  It would be amazing if they hit it (or came close), but that hash rate at that price point seems too good to be true.  I ordered a Jalapeno because $150 is within my comfort zone of risk.  If BFL packs up shop and I'm out my cash, I'll be pretty ticked, but it will not ruin me or even hurt me.
I bought because the tech is exciting to me and the form-factor and power consumption put it well within the "I want to buy this to check it out" zone for me.

Isn't half of BTC Guild's hashing rate just a few miners?  Even if everyone left but them, BTC Guild will still one of the biggest pools.
That said, my 1,000 MH/s miners run on BTC Guild simply because BTC Guild was the pool I discovered first.  I have Slush's pool as my backup.  Any suggestions for other pools to check out?

My miner can do 1GH/s.  I am currently mining in a pool, but every now and then I think it might be better to mine solo.  At current difficulty, how long with 1GH/s will it take to hit a block?  Currently in the pools I do about 0.11 BTC a day which feels low.
Sorry for the noob question.

I believe this is what's needed for the transaction: 
Even though I'm set at normal for fees, it looks like there isn't one attached to this.  Possible to cancel this and resend or do I just need to wait it out?
Thanks for your help &amp; insight!

I have actually never tried mining solo.  Maybe I'll switch over my miner for a week when I'm out of town for work and see how lucky or unlucky I get.
Thanks for the info!

It's coming from Blockchain.info so unfortunately I am unable to resend as it's no longer in my balance there.  So I'm at the mercy of the network at the moment.  Currently have 1.4BTC in limbo and that's making me very uncomfortable.

I got a refund (paid with PayPal) a couple weeks ago.  I sent an email and 1 day later, I got my money back.  No delays, no questions.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:32:45
Still unconfirmed.  Been 26 hours.  Beginning to get worried about those funds.  Going to try and find a contact with Blockchain to see if I can get them to cancel or something.
Thanks again for your assistance.

But if you're not a developer, you're not the market he wants to sell to right now.  As the current product has limited production, they do not want to sell to consumers mainly, they're looking for devs.  More devs with devkits mean more support when consumer model launches.  Then, bitcoin support will be much more likely/useful/probable.

I'm pretty new to Bitcoins but so far I've had good luck with BitMit.

I have one on order as well.  "Wise purchase" depends on why you bought.  If you're looking to make a profit, then you're probably out of luck.  You're looking at mid-summer at the earliest for delivery, and even that's optimistic.  By then the difficulty will be off the charts.  We're already seeing the effect of ASIC, just look at the pool speeds (especially BTC Guild).
I bought because $150 is well within my margin of risk and I think the tech (if it lives up to 4.5GH/s) is pretty cool.  Honestly, at this point, I think there's a 25% chance BFL will never ship, 25% chance they'll ship before June 2013 and 50% chance they ship before end of the year.  Either way, by mid/late 2013, the difficulty will be so high that the Jalapeno will be a neat toy, but nothing you'll be "raking in the cash" with.

5BTC is 5BTC.  Independent of the exchange rate.

I believe it was right around 1.10 BTC or $50.  Packing slip does not say how much I paid for it exactly.  Shipping was very inexpensive (I live in Boston, MA USA).

I bought a Raspberry Pi via Bitcoinin and it came with a case and a personal note saying: "Thanks for the Raspberry Pi order (we've included a free case too)! -Neil @ Botcoinin"  I think the name is Neil.  Either way, I am a very happy Bitcoinin customer.
Also, ordering was easy, payment verification was quick and shipping was fast.  Overall very good and again, I'm a happy customer.

If the price really dropped to $20/BTC or less, I think I am not alone in wanting to buy in as much as possible at the 'bottom'.  There would be a lot of panic selling for people who are in it for a quick buck, but others who are in it long term would see a significant drop as an investment opportunity.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:45:23
Actually, it's already set at normal.  Hummm...
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:29:02
Yea, that's probably it.  I used the Blockchain.info quick send field and I think that sends without fee.  It looks like if I did a Custom Send then I could include a fee.  I'll wait it out and see if it goes through.

I don't smoke...  so thanks, I guess?
