I understand that's been around a while. I am guessing that the difference between this and the new Cboe offerings is backing by financial regulations/bodies? Or am I missing something?

Yeah, no. Very quiet day if that's the biggest swing.

Yeah, that was a dumb move. We've all made them. Buy back and hodl

Very good point. Bitcoin price might be deflated right now because it actually represents typical increase minus the panic selling. Looking forward to that subtraction vanishing from the equation.

Well FWIW, my parents are not positive. When I talk about it, I hear either "but it's not real!" or "the thing criminals use?". *sigh*

This isn't reassuring. Saying "we are talking about US based finance companies" is like talking about the car you are considering and saying "this is a used car salesman who has been operating for 20 years".

Because people see that and think "I need to sell now before it hits $1k like everyone thinks" which brings the price down.
Edit: Or there is price manipulation. Whales short it, and then sell off a ton, to make their short come true

Yep. You can see this in the constant (and tiring) reports from the major financial news outlets - "OMG bitcoin just dropped/increased by 20%!!!!". That is NOTHING to us, but still freaks the dinosaurs out.

Buying and selling a future never involves buying or selling an actual bitcoin

How is the duration calculated? The coins can be moved between multiple exchanges and hardware wallets, so is it just based on your word?

Smaller fees, maybe?

Dinosaur institutions getting jealous of all the gains by bitcoin hodlers. So trying to grab some cash using one of their old methods (future trading)
