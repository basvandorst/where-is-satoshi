Oh one more thing.. You are asking the wrong question.
You should ask btc-e support, "WHY did you unlock my 2FA, can I get a record of that request".
Maybe then you'll get the email-text the attacker sent -- if that's how they did it.
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:28:47
Oh.. then you're fucked... I don't think I have ever transferred coins out of BTC-E without first having to approve it via email. So they probably have access to your email...
Maybe check your email's SPAM or TRASH folder?

Why would the hacker unlock 2FA and wait 2 weeks.
Unless disabling 2FA is part of some sort of btc-e vulnerability.
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:25:02
So basically, there are two possibilities.
1) There is a bug in btc-e which allows 2FA unlocking by a third party
2) The OP's computer is compromised and the attacker used it to unlock 2FA without his knowledge...
But  wouldn't make sense. If he has the OP's account and email under control, then he would just transfer the coins right then and there... Why even bother disabling 2FA so he can log in himself.

Funny people always say that. But btc-e has always been completely reliable for me as an exchange for my mined coins.
Yes their grammar and english is bad but, from my experience, they run a pretty solid operation.
That being said, I do not use them to store my coins. But that's a given.
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:20:25
OP, please answer question's. Is your btc-e email address changed?
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:43:00
Yikes... you just let everyone know your IP address.. I hope you don't have one of them backdoor routers....
Also, you are probably going to piss a lot of people off invoking the "reddit personal army" in your support emails.

What exactly in this email am I supposed to be upset about?


So you're mad because people want to try different cryptos, or are you mad because they are calling you names?
Are you guys going to be mad at me because I use litecoin? And sometime I refer to this sub as a bunch of libtards?
Come on dudes, I like Bitcoin and all, but you guys are getting all pissy for nothing.
We should be happy they are entertaining the idea of using cryptocurrency. Or don't be happy. Who gives a shit. You act like this is proof Clinton is trying to bring down the blockchain or some shit.

This is the first time I've seen this question get upvoted here on this subreddit, but it has always been something that made no sense to me about bitcoins.
Why would I give all my identification to a site, just so I can buy bitcoin... Doesn't that ruin the whole point?
Yet some how people have been doing this year after year. I don't know how you guys justify it. It's like... "oh bitcoin is awesome freedom money... but in order to get my hands on it, I had to fax my driver license to some random website... o_O
I lost a couple of bitcoins to MtGox because I refused to ID myself when they implemented the ID policy. I would have gotten my coins out before their demise if it wasn't for that.
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:35:51
I know this is not the place to say this, but why are you guys so hung up on bitcoins? Is this a gambler's high or something? 
It's a just a tool we're using to do make our lives a bit easier. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 06:42:40
why cant you just transfer your coins to another address and cash out with another service?
@_date: 2013-05-01 06:48:10
I agree with you. It's fun to get back into building rigs. Ever since I started using macs, I never touched a PC component again.
But it's fun to get back into it and I feel like its part of the learning process.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:13:45
I am new to bitcoin, so can you help answer this question for me. 
With this code (bitaddress.org from github), can I safely store all of my bitcoins as just text strings on my computer, without having to ever sign up for a bitcoin wallet?
@_date: 2013-05-14 13:28:13
From my limited understanding, yes. That's actually what a vulnerability is, a way to break out of any imposed security limits. But to relieve any unreasonable fears, if you run a java app on a domain like cisco, or google, you're probably safe.
You're most likely most vulnerable when you don't even realize the website is loading Java and using an exploit. But anyways, lets not single out Java. It's not the only access point. Even the browser is vulnerable to exploits.
Yea I know, it's a scary cyber world...
@_date: 2013-04-27 04:52:59
care to give us a breakdown of how much your rig cost and what it's making for you?
@_date: 2013-05-01 16:13:26
Does anyone know if there is a place that keeps track of the total computational power of the bitcoin mining network? maybe even break it down by pools.
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:06:25
Can someone explain to me what people mean when they say Bitpay "eliminated your risk". 
Does this mean that bitcoins you accept with bitpay are immediately and automatically converted to USD?
Or does Bitpay provides some sort of guarantee against volatility?
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:38:49
I feel like this convo thread needs to be BestOf. This is probably one of more the amazing thing I've witnessed on reddit. I am not doing it though. I don't want to get yelled at.
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:51:10
Really great forensics work and thinking out of the box!
I am still curious why you did not find the headers that you said exists in all wallet.dat files?
Did the fragmentation screw it up?
@_date: 2013-08-29 18:03:12
Is gmaxwell just assuming it's a CoinJoin test because of the high input and output in that transaction?
@_date: 2013-04-14 07:33:24
In the paper detailing bitcoin, they refer to "the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services".
Is this something that is really that big of a deal? Are we talking about things like paypal reversing a payment when a customer complain? Or something much more devious?
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:57:07
So what happens when I pay you 5 bitcoins (~$500usd) worth of rent today , and tomorrow the value goes down to like $50 per coin?
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:47:57
 or craigslist. But be smart. Like you would be when buying anything else from craigslist people.
@_date: 2013-05-14 05:07:24
All of these stories about stolen bitcoins makes me think of someone who puts 10 deadbolt on their door, but left their windows open (no pun intended).
All these tutorials teaching people to encrypt their wallet data, use two-factor-auth etc... are creating a false sense of security. (like the guy on here who triple winzipped his file...)
None of that shit matters if your computer is running outdated Java or a thousand of other vulnerabilities...
I also find it really interesting that now cyber criminals have a reason for hacking into personal computers for things other than creating a botnet.
Bitcoin stealing is probably the easiest way to steal money and make a profit.
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:50:49
Technically speaking, can't you just get lucky and solve for a hash in your first try? (earning you 25 coins)
It's very unlikely, but it is possible right? Or am I not understanding this.
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:59:10
Zoe, you really should accept them. Then write a story (oops I meant radio show) about how it went and how it could be spent.
In the end you can donate it if you want. But you should not just throw it away. It all part of the experience. I would love to hear about it on Planet Money.
@_date: 2013-08-30 03:47:17
I don't get this at all. Does dreamhost normally release pointless newsletters like this?
@_date: 2013-05-01 16:33:39
None of the answers here make any business sense to me really. If at current rates I can mine more coins than I get paid to rent, I would mine. I would trade the coins immediately for cash if I had any doubts about bitcoin's future.
Unless they are collecting money for a "reservation" to rent mining rigs in the near future. Then the purpose would be to raise capital to buy rigs, which makes more sense.
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:21:21
LOL. I am daydreaming about hacking into your network and running a miner on it while you guys are not using it...
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:47:27
I think what adds to the security problem is that a lot of bitcoin aficionados are also security nuts.
So when they talk about how to secure bitcoins, they put in a lot of elaborate steps. For example, telling people to bootup a usb-linux install just to generate a private key etc...
This is all great and dandy if you understand what it means, but when you don't understand security very well, these extra steps obscure what is really important -- which from what I understand --- is making sure no third party internet services has a copy of your private key in their database since they can be hacked at any moment.

You mean by the bank's security camera?
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:20:13
Please write a guide. I still don't see a good option that does not require me leaving my house, or providing too much identification to a random website I don't trust.

How do you make the deposit at BofA? Do you just walk in and deposit to a certain account number? Do you have to show ID? have a BofA account etc??
I am looking for a way to deposit and buy bitcoins without having to give my ID. I find it strange so many bitcoin services require ID.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:27:39
Really? I would think storing my bitcoin (which I imagine is like an RSA key or something) in text format would be easiest and most secure. 
I've seen multiple of instances of people being robbed because they trusted the wrong wallet software.
@_date: 2013-04-20 03:09:00
The other day I asked a simliar question, and apparently you can mine a block with NO transactions. In order words, no auditing. 
I don't understand why this is allowed. If auditing is not actively being done, the system cannot continue because new transactions won't be recorded.
@_date: 2013-04-17 03:19:08
So my understanding is: a new "block" is formed by grouping a bunch of new transactions together, and then people mine for the hash to that block.
My question is, how does the system decide which transactions to include? And when other people verify the hash, how do they know which transactions were included to generate that hash?
@_date: 2013-04-14 09:26:58
Thanks for writing this Daniel, this is probably THE MOST helpful bitcoin post I've read all week. If I had any bitcoins I would tip you.
@_date: 2013-08-13 21:18:05
FUCK. This happened to me today. Now my BTC are trapped in MTGOX and I refuse to verify my account.
Like the OP I am not transferring to USD. I am transferring to another bitcoin address.
OP did you ever get this resolved? 
@_date: 2013-05-14 05:18:30
I am not a security expert, but the answer should be yes. If you have a computer that NEVER connects to the internet, you can put one of those address generator code on it and generate an address.
Then you can transfer your bitcoin to that address and it should be safe, because no one can get your private key. Blah blah blah.. cold storage... whatever... unless your roommate steals your computer.. haha..
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:26:22
How the fuck did you manage to say something like that and get 300+ upvotes on this subreddit. Are you a wizard???
