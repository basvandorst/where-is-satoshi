Are you saying they need to take a shower

There was a lot of legal stuff on the silk road. It wasn't a black market, just a free market

I've seen no evidence

Sounds like theft evasion to me

I disagree, the content was neither posted nor owned by DPR or the admins and they have no responsibility to be the police.

I pay for things I want all the time, while not under duress. I would happily defend myself and my friends, or pay for defense services voluntarily. 
You'd never have said "well I guess you're okay with starving" to someone who received food rations but wanted a food market in a communist state, even though it logically follows from your argument. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:49:29
You're mistaken, he was never tried for that, nor was the defense allowed to enter facts about that into evidence, and a significant portion of the prosecution's information was withheld from the defense. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:22:46
It wasn't a criminal market it was a free market, and he didn't sell any drugs. Illegal shit happens all the time on Craigslist and they don't arrest the whole Craigslist team.

He was sentenced, but never got a fair trial. The judge was clearly biased and used him to set an example, whether he was guilty or not. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:47:57
"The Law" is simply the men with guns that have the power to enforce their viewpoints. Obviously they went and kidnapped him and failed to give him a fair trial, so the fact that "the law disagrees" is a bit of a truism isn't it? 
 According to natural law Ross did nothing wrong.

Okay "puffingreen" -- all I can say is I'd stick up for you too if you got double life in prison for puffin green.

Unfortunately logic is not your strong suit, but I'll spell it out for you. 




Implies 


Even though you could voluntarily pay for groceries instead of paying for them under the threat of violence.


Even though private sewer systems do exist and decentralized solutions like septic tanks work well too, and are paid for voluntarily without the threat of violence. 
So, in the same light, I can be opposed to theft and murder and be in favor of defense of innocents, because there are ways to defend yourself and others that don't involve stealing from everyone on a prolific scale (such as learning martial arts, being risk averse, putting better locks on your door, hiring a body guard, visiting establishments that have private armed security over those with rampant muggings, etc, all of which are voluntary decisions).

This is a long shot but, freeross.org ... We owe him a lot for the advancement of Bitcoin !

That's exactly what the phrase means jackass. The implication of the parent comment is that if something  is illegal in first world countries then it's wrong. Smoking weed is illegal in first world countries, but the Reddit hive mind doesn't see it as wrong. So, our initial premise has absurd conclusions, and is fallacious.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:17:22
No sarcasm. I've explained it previously, here:
Of course the answer is already all over Reddit and the internet, you don't have to venture far to find it. But if you spend all your time here then, well, you might have a limited perspective.

Nothing, if you want everyone to know you have an anti BCH agenda.

Is there a built in, non altruistic incentive to use segwit? 
If segwit cures the fee problem, then why don't they make it so a segwit transaction will complete at say 1/10 the cost, or as if if 10x the amount was submitted as fee? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:30:37
Why doesn't segwit have a built in use incentive? Segwit transactions should take priority over non-segwit transactions without regard to fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:24:20
They are used for all kinds of things, including sending money across borders to poor family members, a hedge against inflation in places like Venezuela, grey and anonymous marketplaces.

It's called a reductio ad absurdum. He was pointing out that "being illegal in developed countries" doesn't necessitate whether something should be a crime or not
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:56:59
Not if you have to beg people daily to use it and convert, it's not incentive enough, no. If you make segwit transaction take priority people will switch without you begging them or trying to sell the idea.

"Regular fiats" aka government fiats are inflationary because it's another way to tax the general public surreptitiously, not for any Keynesian bullshit excuse of a reason 
@_date: 2016-06-26 10:12:00
It's called framing

Patents are completely counter to the idea of decentralized money, open source, DAOs, and everything crypto stands for. But then again so are banks so color me unsurprised I guess. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:57:08
That may be so, but I stand by my point. The patents aren't encouraging innovation, they are stifling it.

This doesn't address what I said at all. My comment was regarding the fairness of his trial, not his sentencing.

Seriously. The next official tweet is gonna be, "well we were gonna add support until we heard ur attitude now u guys can suck it!!"
@_date: 2016-10-08 14:24:30
They'll never know. Need some dead man's switch to show them a video of your wallet with price tag and conversion to USD being securely wiped. Then a little gif guy at the bottom going "eat my ass, eat my ass" just like the old "under construction" guys from web 1.0 except this one is doing a goatse 
@_date: 2016-07-22 15:11:42
Of course it matters. If someone puts a gun to your head and forces you to kill someone or lose your own life, the responsible party is the one forcing you, not you. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 17:36:28
Hey whoa whoa, what happened to the passive-aggressiveness? You're like full blown aggressive now, which you were lecturing other people about earlier. 
I'm talking about flipping the bits on my hard drive and then having my DAC convert the bits into analogue sound thru my speakers. Don't tell me how to flip my bits and I won't tell you how to make money off your bit patterns. 
And fwiw I am a musician and no I'm not full time. But if I did go full time, it'd be because I'm as creative a businessperson as I am a musician. I wouldn't get all caught up trying to sell CDs or mp3s (although physical media is making a comeback so maybe thinking about pressing vinyl would be worthwhile? My point remains). 
@_date: 2016-07-22 17:38:30
Yeah and the one "forcing" the guy to hold a gun to someone's head so they'll shoot the bank teller is really the rich people who keep their money in the bank right 
@_date: 2016-07-30 22:07:22
I think they were trying to say bitcoin will never steal your bitcoin
