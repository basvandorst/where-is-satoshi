First explain to me why I need to purchase subscriptions for 10 different online streaming services to get all the content I want to watch? Netflix, Stan, ABC, Nat Geo, Presto, iTunes, Foxtel would total over $1,000/month. To watch an average of 1.5 individual things from each provider. Absurd.
Oh that's right... because every content creator and distributor doesn't want to negotiate a deal with the one service bending over backwards to get their content Netflix.com and instead make their own service to fuck me in the arse with.

What a complete and utter waste of space, power and clock cycles. 
If only this was doing something useful like helping fold proteins or anything else science related.

Whoop de-fucking do. Your chainstate folder should already be excluded, just like any service's datastore folder that user content can add to.

Yep! A great example of a capitalist that says so proudly but also fights for the rights of the better future we are all capable of having. One does not exclude the other!

Why the fuck are so many morons up voting this post? Simple is not a fucking bank, they hold their funds in other third party banks. They could be closed down at any moment for this - get this post off the top.

And how exactly does he plan to cash out that $200,000 ?

Yes, they now live off $1.26/day

I hope you mean gold/silver and not bitcoin, as it will be worthless in a society without power or free flowing internet.

Looks like it's about time you bitcoin guys stopped using GigaHashes (GH) and started using TerraHashes (TH). Those numbers are getting huge.
