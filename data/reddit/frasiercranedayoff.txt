The bond market pricing 30 year US bonds at like 2.4%. I assume they have a good understanding of future value of money.

Nobody says that this a meaningless thing, just the title is clearly wrong.

When you've got Paul Krugman calling it "basically a ponzi", and Warren Buffet calling it rat poison, I'm not going to fault anyone for not getting it.

It depends really. Everyone always says not your keys not your bitcoin implying you should have control of your bitcoin. But for the average user just buying &lt;1k it's probably safer to buy it and leave it on a reputable exchange like coinbase.

In theory they can provide more cashback than the credit card swipe fees if they make it up on the backend with interest .

People buying

I would buy at coinbase or pro.coinbase.com depending on how you plan on funding the transaction. Coinbase takes credit cards and is a little simpler to understand imo, but has higher fees.

You can refuse cash in the US. You just can't refuse cash for a debt. Typically nobody does because it's stupid to potentially turn away business.

Yeah, but the debt doesn't occur until after I give you the coffee. Businesses can refuse to sell for whatever reason as long as the reason is not a protected class (like race). So at like a Starbucks, they wouldn't agree to sell you the coffee until you've already paid, meaning there's no debt, as you don't have possession of the coffee before paying. 
I'm not sure how it works at a sit-down restaurant if you've already drank the coffee, but I havent heard of any sit-down restaurant that refuses cash.

More germs than a toilet (assuming you clean it as often as most people do).

Europe caps their fees at like 0.5% iirc, as opposed to the US which is often like 2.5-3%. It works out to about the same for the consumer if you get a good cashback card. They typically don't have rewards cards, but I get like 2-2.5% back.

Not everyone in a market needs to understand how to value a security. Smart money can move the market to the correct price. Just because I dca into the s&amp;p500 doesn't mean big players aren't using all available knowledge to make money and move the price of amzn to a fair value.
Whether or not bitcoin has enough smart people able to value it is certainly up for debate. I'd guess it's not being priced correctly as every other halvening has shot up the price.
