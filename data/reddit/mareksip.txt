If I recall correctly, the reason was that vitcoin was not ready for mass adoption at that time.

Most stories with houses on r/bitcoin are other way around, people selling houses in order to buy BTC.
It sucks that people have to change back to fiat in order to buy a house. Looking forward to times it would be possible to buy a house with BTC directly.
Anyway, I still think Bitcoin will cros your path soon.

Yea. I send there some euros and the balance was updated only about 10% of the anount I sent. I also suggest to consider that money gone. Nevertheless the most important thing to do is mention it in Bankcrupcy claim.

Please, do not try to monetize this kinda "lets educate each other/open knowledge" community. Nevertheless, you are free to put your bitcoin tipping address into your account comment same as I do. I am not saying that mentioning in question title "hey iam paying ten bucks for answer to my issue" is a good idea. Probably, if nobody answers your question, no one would either for 10 bucks. Maybe you should know how to structure your question to get an appropriate answer. Honestly, if you want to pay someone try freelancers for bitcoins. People do SO because they have a free time and enjoy that. Your idea to implement bitcoin should move somewhere else.

* Q 1. What will happen to non-US creditors then? / or eventually non-Japanese creditors.
* Q 2. What is the amount of assets held by Mt.Gox in US?

Mark Karpeles sold his blue ball and is all-in into bitcoin now.

Yes. I am currently working on multi-purpose WP App that includes Wallet feature for send/receive bitcoins. It is Blockchain API dependant. 
You can download here:

It is still in development phase (BETA). App currently supports send and receive feature. Fixes for scanning key pair will be out available soon. I do recommend to use with smaller amounts.

2 days ago I made SEPA deposit to Bitstamp. Yesterday bought and withdraw btcs. I know its not instant but considering bank transfers to Paypal or Skrill makes it faster.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:42:04
Hmm, actually good news, right? Thank Gox for protecting me to access my own BTCs !
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:36:20
 Brace yourselves ;)
@_date: 2014-11-25 14:46:31
It is available in every country I guess. Are you having troubles downloading?
@_date: 2014-12-28 12:07:12
This is wong assumption. People with deep understanding of some topic are tend to publish their knowledge. Who do you think created majority of Wikipedia's content? 
Stackexchange is research levelplatform,not freelancer.
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:41:26
Anyone knows the amount that was sold? :D
@_date: 2014-12-28 11:54:31
There is no need for that, everyone is allowed to put BTC address to account description. Implicit button for tipping would attract people that are looking to make money instead of enthusiasts providing high quality Qs and As
The content would probably change from research-like to exact-code solving post for programmers that are stucked with their work 3 hours before submitting deadline.
Stackoverflow is trying to stay on research level more like wiki. Is it possible to tip people who create content on Wikipedia?

c'mon put that wallpaper on your laptop and some stickers too, let others know there is wallet.dat file to steal or keylogger to deploy! Nice pics btw.

What do Mt.Gox and Silk Road have in common? - They both were shut down!

1. Why is it limited to 5 accounts, do you have a memory limit?
2. Will it support multisig?

To be honest, I am not really fan of conspiracies and I would rather wait how the trial turns out. But it reminded me of one article from Guardian:


Source: 
The amount of 600 000 BTC is almost the same amount as is considered "lost" from Mt.Gox.
Concidering Karpeles bought SR from Ulbrich that might imply why FBI failed to get the rest of 600k as they were in the hands of MK.

Times changing pretty fast, though.
