I thought its something serious inside ... and what he showed... in similar way we could say "dont eat because it will eventually become just shit" or "dont work because eventually you will anyway change your work...someday"... -.- .... ehhhh hehe

China playing fool again ... and all markets following... world simply follow as another idiot under this .... Few days later we will hear this was just fed and we begin again ... wouldnt be simpler to remove all china markets from visibility? (yeah hehe I know its irrealistic but just have enough seeing China this and that and btc rolling like stone becuase of their shits - as its nothing more then shits from their fail news!). Wasnt China gov or central bank clear lately there? They wont ban bitcoin etc? Its like seeing that markets DO NOT LEARN on mistakes :/ ehhhhh

Well this is one of some examples what I am getting from paypal.... This one was from 2 days ago for amount of 100 usd.  
I sold stuff to client via my website. After 2 months he simply went to his own bank claiming he didnt make the payment and started dispute under paypal. Paypal open dispute and put on hold money asking from me for details. OK I provided all (full history of contact, IP, even gave SCANNED PAPER FROM bank of this person showing it was him who did this (yes this person sent me this) and I informed paypal that I am in contact with person who do the whole payment and problem). Results - Paypal took additional 20 usd to "conduct" this case and after some days simply sent me this message I posted here removing full 120 amount from me like nothing happened...  
I AM ASKING - WHY THE F**** I need to be doomed on this service?  
BITCOIN - PLEASE GET ALREADY as TOP MAIN way of payments... I am sick and starting to get bankrupt :(  
For me I have swarm of reasons to avoid paypal, skrill and similar services - Be sure its not service for YOU its service for scammers, cheaters and robbers! And these services simply helping, or more like doing all to work for them :/  
SAD!

Hmm I rea it and came with few possible future solutions that will happen:
* 1) It's too slow for retail transactions =&gt; it might be possible that other coin will take over place of bitcoin with super fast confirmation speeds... and transaction system will be limited to basic (but enough secured) steps...
* 2) Digital security is WAY behind digital currency = This part is nothing news honestly - you just probably never had similar situations and feeling lost in world of owning important info... Well Civilzation is heading into future, and in my future everyone should own and take care of OWN money/assets/valuable stuff... So this point I pretty like as I feel like I am the one who control whats with my goodies ;)
* 3) The recent MtGox implosion -- and the subsequent reaction =&gt; I will not discuss this one as there were more topics and posts about this and I will not say anything unusual :(
* 4) Consumer protection ==&gt; In short version: I believe soon or later some kind of regulated protection (maybe specialized under controlled way exchanges will take part here with still unregulated coins :P) will appear as necessity is the mother of invention... 
    So its all just matter of time...
    Yes your points are pretty correct and unfortunatelly or fortunatelly many thinks similar ;) but all of this doesnt need to mean bad things - it could be exactly opposite... Maybe this is the time where Bitcoin will be upgraded on surrounding sides...
   Cheers

0.0 ... this s.... make me stunned...

what I believe... and think... its just matter of time.. they had huge dossing at 10-11 and they announced this... they announced that btc withrawal problems are because of this... So I am sure its just matter of time they will settle everyone in this issue in time - they just doing this step by step - with own hands as no other way for them.....
So no stress- just hold on - maybe even it will be on your plus as you wont sell this btc at low price ;)
