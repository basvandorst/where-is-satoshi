I saw that. What a sore loser. How could anyone be so heartless towards Andreas? I mean the dude couldn't be more amazing! And Roger Ver couldn't be more of a dick.

Keep 1 BTC in, just in case. You won't miss that 16k when it's gone to 1 mill in 3-5 years time.

I’ve been watching too much Gary Vee  �� (he bangs in about how undervalued FB shares are.)

Yes I know. But as a full lump sum investment of my all savings, not diversifying. Just purely bitcoin- is that what you would do?

Oh god I thought you meant by alt  an alertnative - like silver or gold. But you mean alt coins- I don’t even know what that is. Lol. So you think a 100% bitcoin investment too risky?

Thank you so much for this! No way I'm even considering any shares now after the research into bitcoin and alt I've done today. Thanks for the feedback. Much appreciated!

Yes sorry, I know what's happening with Bitcoin, hence my wanting to buy it. However, they say it's best not to put all your eggs in one basket. Hence my thinking of stocks such as Facebook. Let's just forget I mentioned bloody Facebook! As an investment- what do you guys think of Bitcoin for someone to invest their entire lump sum of savings into for the next 3-5 years? That's the question I should have asked.

No I’m not.

Thank you so much for this! Amazing. Lots to think about, but needless to say, going all in on Bitcoin or bitcoin and some other alt coins I'm looking at is where my head is now. Much appreciated!
