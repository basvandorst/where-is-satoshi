Nothing is clear here, let alone OPs age. How the heck should we judge age based on the little information given? I'm just cherry picking that piece of your comment because I know thats not your point but it's an easy argument to make. Ill admit Op is clearly under armed for this but maybe we should be helping people learn in this space instead of beating them up and telling them they cant play here. Just my 2 cents. Feel free to pick this apart. I'm going to sleep so you've got about 15 hours if you wish to rebuttal. Cheers!

Slipped on the sidewalk and lost his memory. Lost his loot. Thats what I see happening to you relying on memory and free services that may close. Aside from that, good luck!

You lost for calling him a libtard. Is that how you sway someone to your side? Insults? Even if you gave him a better idea hes not going to take it. Step up your game. You make us all look dumb by association. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 06:50:25
Not helpful. He should stop everything, learn what hes trying to do, and then resume activity. Selling and getting out is the last thing he should do, unless hes not willing or able to lose that $20.

Why the medical shaming? We dont criticize your webbed toes.
@_date: 2018-05-22 08:01:59
I don't stock shelves. That's the task of my associates. Secondly, its Walmart, with one L. Haven't you seen our signs? We've got stores pretty much everywhere.  It really tickles me that you think insulting someone for having a job is effective. That's ok though, I'm not offended. Someone has to work there and I have no shame in it being me. You seem angry about something. Are you OK?

Edit: my bad, thought you were a wanderer talking smack on the fly.
You want a real reason? Your big stupid brain is fragile and you dont own Google or Microsoft servers. Not your keys not your bitcoin. I dont care that you encrypted them. Its not the kind of private data you put out there. Extrapolate from there. If you cant see the risks, you shouldnt be your own banker.
Glacier protocol if you want to secure your bits.

I had written out a longer, different response that was then edited when it occurred to me that you were OP. The quoted text was a direct response to the passive aggressive response you gave when you asked for feedback , got that feedback, but didn't like the answer you received. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 16:16:04
Thats too bad he didnt respond with no, its not illegal. That would have been nice.
@_date: 2018-05-18 14:31:18
Np. All sideways humor aside, I'd honestly think your better off burying those 2/3 keys in the ground than putting them online. Just my opinion. Hope you find an ideal solution to your problem.

Bingo. Thats how i roll. Btw cash app may not be cheapest but by golly its quick. I can spend fiat and have btc in hand within minutes. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:01:09
Thank you kindly.
@_date: 2018-06-06 19:27:46
Not sensitive at all. You replied with a change of topic so I'm merely redirecting back to what was being discussed. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 17:03:15
I'm in the same boat. Look at btcpayserver and the woocommerce plugins. You should be able to accomplish this with a vps or two and a good linux admin.

Monero. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 15:01:49
If we're abandoning this ship I'm swimming to Monero.
@_date: 2018-06-09 03:14:59
Too bad zcash is a shitcoin. Should have went with something like Monero. You know, a coin with actual privacy instead of this opt in farce zcash supports.
@_date: 2018-06-02 15:42:52
I hodl monero with my bitcoin.

Well considering that dude was busted while trying to commit a murder-for-hire felony, probably nothing. And before you go foaming at the mouth about whatever conspiracy bullshit you're getting ready to spew, save it. I don't care. He broke the law and got caught. That's the gamble and he lost. It wasnt an accident and it wasn't altruistic. He was in it for the money. Period. Pick a better cause.

I'm a soon to be customer. My better half has printed (weird, right?) half your catalog while she bracket decides which one to try first. Now if only she would make a decision...
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:45:55
Drug addled zombies take offense to that. He's on a whole 'nother level
@_date: 2018-06-06 19:13:07
Cash app is good. Very quick conversion from fiat to btc. Move your btc to a wallet in which you and you alone control the private keys. Dont leave your btc on the cash app.

Walmart will pay you to go to college for biz management or supply chain management

Its not practical by any means but you can receive blocks via satelite on battery power as well as transmit via vhf using a ham radio. Just saying.

Fuck him and his patents.

Accept Monero please. I hodl btc but I transact in Monero;)

We arent talking about Aaron, this is about Ross. If the only crime Ross committed was to facilitate trade id be all for it. Its not. He wasnt the paragon of freedom people try to make him out to be.
@_date: 2018-06-05 22:19:11
Bitcoin and monero for me please.
@_date: 2018-06-17 19:13:23
Unfortunate choice of name. Very confusing. Cant wait to use it tho!
@_date: 2018-06-09 03:58:39
Doing it wrong. Find item, buy the btc to cover cost, spend btc. Done. Same objective, better execution. Just my opinion and how I do it.
@_date: 2018-07-20 04:24:49
Nailed it.

BCH isnt bitcoin. If you sent BCH you sent bitcoin cash. Bitcoin.com supports bitcoin cash and not actual real bitcoin.
