Oh of course we can't have it peeling up and looking classless
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:50:21
Naar de maan! ��
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:32:38
Nah, I'm just kidding. It will crash today (so I can buy cheap) and then go to the moooooooon!
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:26:53
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:18:45
It's not over yet.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:32:50
This is only the bulltrap. Real crash coming up soon.
@_date: 2018-09-25 09:41:36
We’re going to the moooooooooon �� 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:06:25
I have literally no idea, but a huge discount on Bitcoins would be great since I cashed out two days ago. :-)
@_date: 2018-08-26 15:29:56
Guys! If this won't make Bitcoin BLOW UP right now, I don't know what will.
@_date: 2017-02-04 11:54:47
$2000 in the near future, because that's all that matters apparently

Why the hell would you? Bitcoins are the greatest thing since the invention of the wheel.
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:55:19
I hope they are paying Musk in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-17 10:57:02
Bad people are very happy!

Because he had sexual intercourse with her.
@_date: 2017-02-08 14:40:45
Price will be $2k in no time now.

Don't quote me on that.
@_date: 2017-02-07 15:58:25
Hakuna matata.
@_date: 2017-03-10 11:16:25


Eh, nope.
@_date: 2017-03-08 15:54:05
What are you talking about? The ETF will be approved.
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:19:19
It's quite simple. Once approved, the price will go to the moon and beyond.
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:38:27
What's going on? Anyway, buy the dip.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:23:27


It will go to $10k.
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:44:24
Regardless of what will happen.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:44:22
Doesn't give a shit.

@_date: 2017-03-09 18:42:21
$10k, that's what's going to happen.
@_date: 2017-01-18 12:55:47
Cool idea. However, the arrows are too small for intricate graphics. I think it will look a bit messy.
@_date: 2017-01-19 18:25:29
We'll see. Interesting times ahead.
@_date: 2017-01-12 20:53:55
You are DAMN RIGHT! I cannot understand why folks still have fiat money when they could have BTC. This world is on fire, the entire fiat financial system will collapse sooner or later without a doubt. BTC will take over all existing currencies and commodities for sure. We, the folks of are the only people that understand the undeniable fate of the economy as we know it. Long live BTC!
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:12:06
It could be $1000 tomorrow. Who knows.
@_date: 2017-01-12 18:40:56
hey its me ur friend
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:28:10
This will last maybe two weeks or so.
@_date: 2017-01-17 12:55:37
Yeah, indeed.
@_date: 2017-01-12 19:26:26
Spam. Check his posting history.
@_date: 2017-01-20 00:17:58
It'll go up to 10k tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:01:02
Shit is going down
@_date: 2017-01-18 12:57:56


Why exactly?
@_date: 2017-01-12 20:18:54
This guy is a genius.
@_date: 2017-01-20 17:20:53
It'll reach $1045 in 36 minutes.
@_date: 2017-01-21 13:19:24
No. It's a cryptocurrency, not a precious metal.
@_date: 2017-01-19 17:48:13
It wouldn't be as much fun without the comments. :-)
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:47:55
Bitcoin is life. All energy should go towards (mining) Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:03:27


I think a large deal of people are better off leaving such a responsibility in the hand of experienced security experts. I trust the people at Coinbase (or any other established exchange for that matter) more than I trust myself.
