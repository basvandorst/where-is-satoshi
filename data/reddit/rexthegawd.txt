they'll find a way to stifle bitcoin via legislation and push this, I'm personally very wary of this tbh

Good on you!
I remember in 2012 discussing with my investment banker uncle and I will never forget his words "why don't you invest in something proper this is just a flash in the pan". Put me off until I just went and invested much less myself a year later. Even in feburary this year when I broached the topic with him again he laughed and dismissed me "you're still messing around with that rubbish?!". Very glad I believed in what I believed in and stood my ground :)

how come more people don't use LBTC to sell? it seems you can sell for more or am I missing something?

another 5 figure investment is calling
price plummeted the last two times this happened and recovered pretty sharpish

when silk road and the sheep shut down; cannot remember the exact figures for the sheep but when SR shut down the price fell by more than 30 dollars and then a couple months later the rest was history :)
not suggesting that will happen this time but I think it will head back towards the 300 dollar mark quite soon

lol i got scammed by someone despite having their bank card, ID and proof of payment which matched their verification. Verified by myself AND LBTC. Didn't stop them ringing the bank and getting the funds reversed anyway. Sent the evidence to the bank and my account was unlocked 12 hours later but my 5000 dollars is still "in dispute". Should have been in Marseille to watch the Euros QF but hard to do when your holiday fund has been stolen by some cunt :(

Started to
Saved more in 8 months than in the last 8 years by putting what I would usually put in an ISA into BTC instead (obviously the 150% increase or whatever it is has helped a long way). Way too easy for me to move money from an ISA to my current account whereas changing BTC to fiat is slightly more long wondered.
