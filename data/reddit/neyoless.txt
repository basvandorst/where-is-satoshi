Reference 10/10: A scene in The Matrix (1999) where Neo asks Morpheus if he can dodge bullets. The iconic sci-fi action film is about freedom fighters rebelling against huge machines that create a false reality.
Compatibility 10/10:  Like Neo in The Matrix, the investor is likely to get hurt if they try to dodge bullets (sell for fiat). Instead they will triumph if they realize bitcoin's eventual dominance as global currency.
Text 7/10: Morpheus' punchline is separated from the rest of text effectively. Meme uses white font color and black outlines, but deters from the meme standard Impact font.
Repost value 10/10: Appropriately timed as many are worried by a minor correction without zooming out to 3 months on their chart. Time to lose the weak hands :)

Nobody can "realistically" predict what it will be in a few months. Anyone who claims they can is lying.

Forget about your purchase. Come back to it when you're 18 and it will be worth a hell of a lot more.

Hey there. I'll try to explain concisely so you can understand as a newcomer to the crypto space, but also in a way that won't upset any larger community. The debate of BTC and BCH can be a sensitive and controversial topic so I suggest you do your own research for a deeper dive.


BCH is Bitcoin Cash. It was created when the original Bitcoin community disagreed on how to move forward. There are lots of videos on Youtube explaining the specific differences and how BCH came to be. Again this is a highly controversial topic.
What most people refer to Bitcoin is Bitcoin Core (BTC). This is the most well known cryptocurrency, the digital gold, the one you probably wanted to buy. You can get it on any cryptocurrency exchange.
BCH is currently priced at about 425 USD while BTC is about 8,505 USD.


It is extremely easy. Both are very popular currencies and are found on most exchanges. You can sell BCH for fiat (USD, EURO, JPY etc;) and then buy BTC or, alternatively, you can also trade your BCH for BTC straightaway.
I'll list some exchanges: Coinbase, Kraken, Huobi. Look into exchanges - what fees they charge for withdrawals and trade - and pick one that makes sense for you.
