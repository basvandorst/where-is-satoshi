Well, it's sort of a mind fuck... but there are no banks. You wouldn't have a 1000 mortgage for a house valued at 1,500BTC. Someone would ask you for 1000BTC to lend out to buy a house in exchange for a promise to pay $1500 sometime in the future.

The fallacy here is assuming that in 2024 Bitcoin will have become 100% of the worlds wealth. That's not how "wealth" works. Bitcoin is a currency/commodity, and an incredibly efficient one. But it will compete with all of the other currency/commodities too. There will still be wealth in corn, oil, soybeans, gold, etc.

Seriously, though, my experience with the HB community at that time would make me think that it would be prime for accepting Bitcoin payments. We chose it after seeing all of the horrible statistics about US infant death rates during child birth at Hospitals vs. those born at home in other countries. But then we ran into the nightmare of the US health insurance industry. We paid cash to our midwife to avoid all that. Bitcoin would have been perfect. Good Luck!

I'm confused about what your saying. Wallet's don't really mean anything. They are just folders where private/public keys are held. You can send me or post the public addresses and the we/theblockchain can tell you where the BTC ended up. As long as you dont lose control of the private keys (which are stored in the walets) you're fine.

Bitcoin has intrinsic value. It is an elegant solution to the Byzantine Generals problem. The problem is no one can say right now how valuable that is. But it is most certainly intrinsically valuable.

The analogy isn't perfect. As far as we know an atom cannot be broken down infinitely, so removing 99% of matter based atoms might be noticeable. A Bitcoin can be divided infinitely, so removing 99% of them will have no effect on their function.

Cryptocurrency directly monetizes a mathematical abstraction, whereas Calculus only does so indirectly. The concept of monetizing an abstraction is unique today, but it is sound and provable. The value I place in that comes from knowing that other rational people will see the same value I that as I do.  Yes, I drank the koolaid.

It doesn't create a disincentive to spend. It creates an incentive to save. But humans need to buy things to live, so eventually you're going to want a loaf of bread, or some shoes, or a nice car. Instead of every year products getting crappier and crappier because your money is worth less and less, products must get better and better to justify you spending money on them. It's what drove human innovation for thousands of years until the 1930's.

@_date: 2013-04-14 20:27:29
If bitcoin is a currency, then it will compete on the global currency market, so, for example, there are 2-3 trillion USDs in circulation, the market value of Bitcoin should stabalize around that level.
The second part of that... Yes, that's why this is so revolutionary. The value of pi is almost incalculable, but it certainly has 'intrinsic' value.

You're partially right. Fiat currency isn't "becomming" obsolete. It is now obsolete. It is no longer necessary. People may still use it by choice, just as people still ride horses even though as a means of transportation they are mostly obsolete.

Technically it already is illegal, because the blockchain contains illegal numbers (certain prime numbers used to encrypt DVD's and such). The question then, is will they enforce that or any new laws, and how? It appears now that it would be more costly than the War On Drugs has been, and less likely to succeed.
@_date: 2013-04-01 04:20:28
The "limit" is arbitrary and doesn't really mean anything. If all 21m BTCs were "mined" tomorrow it wouldn't change the fundamentals of the protocol. Mostly, that just gives early adopters incentive to invest in the protocol. Yes miners are are key part of the protocol and will always be needed (they may not always be profitable).

cryptocurrency is an abstraction, a mathematical concept. Do those things have a fundamental value? Absolutely. Does Calculus have value? Does the theory of Relativity have value? Whatabout cryptography? They have so much value it's almost incalculable.
If your cryptocurrency is better than Bitcoin, then yes, it too will have value.

During those 24 hours the price will spike even higher. It will mean the government is collapsing and loosing control of their fiat system. They won't have any guns because the currency they pay people in will have no value.
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:39:31
That's circular reasoning. The Federal government prints money and gives it to me so that they can take it back? That's a system with no fundamental value.
Also, if all of my currency transactions are done in Bitcoin, then I don't need to pay the federal government any taxes that I don't choose to. If Bitcoin only offered that then it would have fundamental value greater than zero.
I think your dollar is loosing value as we speak, btw.

Just trying to help you understand... the "price" you see posted on any site is historical; it happened in the past. It is not the price that you can sell X number of bitcoins for. It's was just the last trade that Y number of bitcoins happened at. X and Y are not related at all, so there is no point in averaging them.

I thought the interesting thing about his opinion was that gold holds no intrinsic value. I mostly agree with that. I think bitcoin does hold intrinsic value. It solves the Byzantine Generals problem; quite elegantly. That has far more value than trinkets and jewelry,imho.

Yes, you can choose whatever medium of exchange you want as longs as it's not coerced, or fradulant. The government will only accept USD as payment. Funny how they print the stuff so they can take it back? I wonder how long that system's going to last.

And now that we have Bitcoin we no longer need "legal tender for all debts public and private". Fiat currency is now obsolete. We don't need a currency backed by any government, or gold, or any other physical entity. We have one who's fundamental value is based on mathematics. It is purely abstract, perfect, and infallible.

Bitcoin does carry intrinsic value. It's a common mistake to think that it doesn't, and you caught on to one part of it with it's 'utility'. Even better, though is the bitcoin protocol is an elegant and actually quite brilliant solution to the Byzantine Generals problem in computer science. It has broad applications everywhere you look. Every system that suffers from 'corruption' can be eliminated. Every. Single. One.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:34:36

@_date: 2013-04-03 18:19:05
Irrelevant. How exactly can you ban bitcoin? Ban the internet? Ban communication? Ban mathematics?
bitcoin (lowercase b) is an abstraction. It cannot be banned, just as it wasn't ever 'created'.
Bitcoin (uppercase B) is an implementation. I suppose the government could try to curtail it's use. I'm still not sure how that's even possible, but this is just a thought exercise, right? As bitcoin's wealth accumulates, though, we can simply install politicians that understand it's true value.
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:12:33

My apologies. You are correct about that. The rest of your argument is still nonsense, though. A legal ban on bitcoin will not drop the price. A legal ban on alcohol did not drop the price, it increased it. A legal ban on marijuana has not dropped the price, it has increased it.

The intrinsic value of bitcoin is in the elegant solution it provides for the Bysantine Generals problem. The price will stabalize in the short term (5-10 years)  around whatever the largest market for that solution is. I think it's probably the foreign exchange market right now. Long, long, term, though, that market is Democracy itself.
