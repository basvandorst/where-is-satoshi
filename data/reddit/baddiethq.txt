I sold .5 at 2600 and bought back at 2250. I should have waited till it went under 2100! Why wouldn't you sell short and add those extra coins to ur wallet?

It definitely could have! But I'd never go in on more than 25% of my coins.

Every time BTC hits a new high, it bounces below that high, before going back up. If it looks like it's going to surge, you can buy back at a short loss and still enjoy the gains. If you're only using a percentage of your wallet, there's not much risk, eh?

That analyst was probably right in the fact that the market will correct to around 1800. But I doubt that correction will last more than a couple weeks. The people that bought at 2300+ will likely panic sell. There's no Mt. Gox event, so the analysts basing corrections off that are pretty much comparing the Enron era dot com bubble to BTC, when that already happened.

I invested 30K at 2700, thinking it was going to rally. Then I sold at 2100 and can no longer afford my mortgage!!!!! What should I do??

I seriously doubt he really put bounties on anybody. It was most likely hearsay that was used to put the nail in his coffin
