Yes that is an issue and this sub needs to help out with it by providing easy ways to accept it and places that accept it. This sub also needs to convince the core developers to help as well.

Use them at participating subways or online retailers that accept bitcoin like Steam, Newegg, or Mega.

Yea I was trying to communicate that people are not treating it like a currency, but more an investment
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:56:59
Bitcoin has issues which the core developers need to fix(and fix soon). But the idea of Bitcoin needs to remain that it is a currency is what im trying to say.

I just got that through NiceHash and spent it while it was still worth $750. I was just trying to show how I could have made a lot of money, but didn't even though I felt it was going to rise. I don't have any regret was what I was trying to say.

Yes they do, but this sub needs to change that idea.

How is it a humble brag?

No but Bitcoin was supposed to be better and be an alternative to the banking systems of today. It should be cheap to move BTC. If you are arguing for more expensive fees the only person you are helping is bitmain and other major asic companies who control most of the hashrate.

Yes I largely use btc to pay for stuff. I've bought steam games with it and used the bitpay payment portal so many times. In the past year that's became almost impossible due to services either not accepting it or fees getting to high. But I guess it may not matter for everyone.

I thought you were since you replied to a comment arguing for lower fees with the comment it shouldn't be a charity. Sorry if I misunderstood. But I still think that no it shouldn't be a charity, but it should be available to everyone for cheap costs. What's the point of btc if I can't spend it for cheaper then it costs to do a transaction through my credit card?
