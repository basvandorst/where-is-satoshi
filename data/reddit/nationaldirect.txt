Many people would confuse the Internet as a global network being introduced before E-Mail - However this was not the case. 
Intranets were by-and-large used by governments, academic institutions and other niche industries that needed to transmit communication much like a fax machine - albeit faster and more convenient: messages would be displayed on your computer terminal. This was initially implemented by instrumentation departments - for which Honeywell primarily sold products to at the time (now, they're more into everything like Siemens).
So as it would first operate - it would send data - thru existing **TCP** data network systems - which were already equipped with the now security-obsolete **Telnet** (port 23) service. For reasons primarily at the time being cost of implementing a global network; the intranets largely transmitted data within the organization, where information was also more secure - evidently this was shown to be a factor of less concern until vulnerabilities showed up along the way.
And so back to the ad - It's so much like a Macintosh Computer ad or even *Ativan*^TM (*lorazepam* - a benzodiazepine; a shorter acting valium) ads that were common for the time. This actually was what reminded me of the timeline of the intranet to internet transition. [external - drug ads!](
This - to the best of my knowledge is a direct advertisement of new **SMTP** (port 25) protocol advancements (which were used to receive and send e-mail messages across servers and systems). Today, we still use SMTP for most e-mail's sent out of a domain via an e-mail client.
Cool Post!
