So, where should I put my coins then?

Look at that off-white coloring...

I think bitcoin will top out at $4,000 a piece, another exponential growth session doesn't seem likely

1400 x 450 = $630,000. Here I am wrestling with the idea of buying only 1

Well Iran and Russia are being a bunch of assholes lately so I wouldn't say they're being excluded, but that they're causing their exclusions. Cuba is just Cuba'ing

i feel like all this will be dumped soon and it will fall in price once again

This is the first time I've seen people downvoting out of fear

If there's ever bad news, post that in there too

I was going to buy another whole BTC last night at around $445 and now I am regretting on waiting.
@_date: 2014-07-24 02:35:17
Is it safer?
@_date: 2014-04-08 17:20:04
I'll sell at the ISS

You said the exact same thing in another thread about ghash
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:13:50
thanks bro
@_date: 2015-01-01 05:16:05
I want to believe this

Baby steps man, baby steps.

This scared the shit out of me, hadn't seen the price in a month and thought it was collapsing again.
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:16:03
Yeah I still made a good amount back, and im not really that upset about everything. Still, though, at one point I hovered over a purchase of 33 btc back when it got down to $170ish (that would've been $132k as of today). 
Hindsight is a cunt, but I'm happy that y'all are doing well.

Sold at $1k back in March, I want to die.
@_date: 2016-12-21 00:26:59
Remember a couple years ago when it was floating around $200-250, kept making shitty trades and losing money, so I just decided to not pay any attention to bitcoin and look at where we are now.
@_date: 2015-04-13 04:51:20
If you vote for a politician because he accepts bitcoin, you shouldnt be voting at all.
@_date: 2015-04-06 12:30:43
They stopped that like 3 years ago, this isn't new.
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:37:44
I mean, If I could give you parting advice for bitcoins (after 4 years of doing it)
1. Don't watch the price constantly
2. Don't listen to this sub or r/bitcoinmarkets or any other forum
3. HODL
@_date: 2017-05-21 03:36:58
Kinda want to kill myself because I sold it at $1000 a couple months ago. 
Oh well, nothing I can do, still made some money.
@_date: 2015-10-23 00:42:52
dammit, an extra $2000 would be nice right now.

Is him ordering the murder of that one dude a separate case?
