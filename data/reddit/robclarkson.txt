Bought around 7k, sold right as it tipped under 10k the first time two days ago. Waiting on ACH from coinbase so I can reenter market abouts Friday if its all cooled down.
Got scared, but at working seeing that drop to 10k between calls was worrisome. Wish my state had full gdax so I didn't have to wait around for normal slow coinbase ach turnaround time.

Sucks someone was rude to you. Crummy way to start the day. You are great : )

He's offhandly mentioned it a few times to Purge during height of the Bitcoin hype. He was laughing and dismissive. But he has other stuff to worry about and is great human in almost every way, so prob can give him a pass for not being bonkers about our thing :).

not wanting to put money in what you don't understand is understandable to me. But I just found it funny the title of the post didn't take into account the articles main point is all.

"The mistake
Yes, I think buying Bitcoin would be a big mistake, though it is a relatively easy one to avoid. "
Quote from the end of the guys article. He gave a simpled rounded explanation of Bitcoin then says hes against it personally.

He got to host The International 7 for Dota, I hope that turns keeps being fruitful for him. I LOVE dota as well as traditional blizz products.

The Oatmeal made a [good comic]( about this reaction we all have to new ideas that challenge us. I try and think about this now when something sounds downright wrong/different.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:54:14
Good on you for taking time to explain something to someone who doesn't know so they can make a more informed decision :). Think it's been linked before, but [this xkcd comic]( is how we should all try to react I think.

Ya, hope they included her in some way, explaining it in a non condescending way.

Now he spreads happy positivity out through unique music vidoes as "World Order". Give em a watch ( this gif is from one!)

I literally was just on steam 20 minutes ago buying my stuff, and had to enter a new debit card cause old one expired. Saw bitcoin and did a double take. So ya, spread the word is good!

Think he's Korean, but ya similair stuff!
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:41:10
To be fair, he's giving his honest opinion trying to be helpful. I appreciated that, input from earnest different viewpoints is always good. Helps us to make up our minds and what to look into more.

Ok these is exactly what I was looking for, trying to "visualize" how to play this fee saving game. Put it a tiny bit above what ever is the top posted sell price, to create a new sell line item. Then adjust it if the market drops out from under your sell order waiting for the ticket to bump up and you to get fee selling!
I imagine its the exact same but in reverse for buying, buy JUST below what everyone else is offering. Thank you!
At the moment Gdax won't let me make an account cause my states laws, but I love learning this kinda thing, and maybe can apply it somewhere else! (gdax rocks for info hope my state gets on board someday)
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:24:13
I heard of it in the most basic sense of the term. Saw some silly response gif with subtitling talking about Bitcoin reaching $5800 and I did a serious double take. Stopped looking up what "Protectga" did for FF12 remake and next 8 hours were bitcoin learning.
Wish someone had mentioned it to me a year or two ago, I had some spare money then then as well... Second best time is now I guess!
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:54:48
This is great! Gdax isn't allowed in my state, but I still use it for information purposes.

I looked into learning this when reading that if your order is created an no instant match is found you pay nothing!! Could you explain how to properly do this please?

To add on my second hand knowledge to this. That website was bought by a guy trying to make his own bitcoin business, with some very conflicting viewpoints on bitcoin. He is very disliked by many bitcoin users for confusing "bitcoin" and his "bitcoin cash".
@_date: 2019-01-11 08:30:03
I honestly don't know much about him, other then he is much hated bad hombre to this subreddit. Was trying to stay semi unbiased on a matter I don't really know. :)
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:02:06
haven't heard that one before, negative comments aside. Heh.
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:04:04
Bitcoin.org (NOT .com) is the official website for the group of independent people that work on maintaining bitcoin. Lots of indepth reliable info there with links to other companies to use at your own risk to take the plunge of buying. 
Many starter users like me find using an optional "exchange" (like Coinbase) to do most of the work for us for a modest fee is an easy way to start.
It's not government backed so if something bad happens can lose the money, so be very careful.
