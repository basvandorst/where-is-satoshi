"To those human beings who are of any concern to me I wish suffering, desolation, sickness, ill-treatment, indignities — I wish that they should not remain unfamiliar with profound self-contempt, the torture of self-mistrust, the wretchedness of the vanquished: I have no pity for them, because I wish them the only thing that can prove today whether one is worth anything or not — that one endures." - F. Nietzsche
That's exactly how I feel about the current mess we're in - Bitcoin has to prove it can endure.

ELI5: What exacty did BCH change in the protocol rules and how is it different (apart from being an USG shitcoin)?
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:05:21
Yeah, I think I'll just increment it and have the gap limit set at 500 or something.
As for the timeout and emails, it's all implemented - check it out :)
Edit: and no it is not WooCommerce, it's custom built.

Donation addy?

I'd prefer not to touch any shitcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-29 11:23:03
Needless to say, my Bitcoin is already on an exchange (bought the dip), I just want to shuffle it before moving it to cold storage.

I think you can deposit/withdraw BTC without submitting any KYC.
@_date: 2017-05-29 13:18:20
Now that's an interesting approach. Any chance of seeing the source code?
@_date: 2017-07-15 12:54:44
You sir, are correct.
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:08:52
The fools over at Kraken will list it.
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:09:45
It ain't doubling, but Electrum would've done the job.
@_date: 2017-07-15 09:27:46
You'd effectively be buying Bitcoin + a shitcoin (Segwit2x) you can dump, so yeah why not.
@_date: 2017-07-15 09:23:47
Not sure what's all the fuss about. SegWit2x will simply be an another shitcoin, and I'm dumping the whole lot the moment it becomes possible. Bitcoin is the honey badger, it don't care.

Nope, they can't.


That's something that we, who value Bitcoin for its immutability and safety, would really love to avoid.

Re-read what you've just written and try harder.


Seriously, this derphereum drama is getting rather boring. Haven't you sold your BTC for the high-tech coin that 'fixes' everything what's wrong with Bitcoin and will soon beat BTC at 'market cap' already? The name of this game is 'put your money where you mouth is' and I suggest you play it.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:29:22
Give [this]( a long, careful read. Only weak hands are stressing over "market cap" and it's ok, frankly.
