I actually came here to mention the same thing. Selling GHS doesn't seem to stop the miners, it just means you won't get a percentage of the cut. The only thing that will slow it down are people with their own miners in the pool.

I'm not exactly sure I know what I am looking at here. I use Coinbase and have used it several times with no problems, and according to the website, my Email hasn't been leeched out. I'm sorry if you are having the issues though.

I've actually wanted to do something like this, but I just don't have the money to buy Bitcoins to do this. My video card has been chugging away, but as it stands, it costs me more in electricity than it does to actually mine. Old video cards tend to be less effective. I don't suppose someone has an old ASIC miner they'd be willing to part with? Anyways, I am sure they will be happy!

Thank you, kind sir! Let's just hope I can someone in my family to actually use them!

The wallet.dat file is legit though, password protected and everything. Can you break into the house of a known thief and take their stuff? No? Oh well, looks like I won't be cracking this one. Shame to, 51 some-odd coins in here. (So, at least the scammer wasn't kidding!) The renamed txt file's original file name is NPE.EXE. Also, I've seen people try to hide files like this before, but I am not sure why. I opened it and it came up with Notepad. Surely, no one is going to rename it to exe and run it? How is this type of virus delivery supposed to work? Or, is just 7zip awesome and XP actually renamed it upon extract? Oh, and Virtual PC for the win.
