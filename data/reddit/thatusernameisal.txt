Thank God for all the bitcoin atms everywhere that charge no fees because they run on pixie dust and children's wishes.

Apple will not change the policy no matter how many dozens of phones you smash. And you do resize that by not selling your phones you help apple make more money on new ones?

I would love a system where I can pay a few cent to access a site without getting mind-raped by advertising. Too bad Bitcoin is not anonymous enough for that.

If you can't buy them anonymously it's game over, set up all the wallets you want it's still obvious where they came from.

Not at all, if I don't reveal my identity online nobody can find out who I am unless they can subpoena my ISP (not talking about NSA or the government here) and at some point even that data gets deleted. For bitcoin I would have to use a different wallet for every site so my usage can't be combined into a single profile and I would have to fill every wallet "anonymously". At that point a paysafe card is already a better albeit not perfect option. Maybe if you make an anarchist currency to free the people you should have made it anonymous by design.

Bitcoin is dead anyway, the world doesn't need cryptocurrency that is not anonymous by design.

Essentially Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme. People who created it mined a large amount of coins for themselves before going public with their "currency" and now they get rich promoting it to others, all while the coins themselves are actually backed up by nothing and have no real value. If anything, bitcoins are virtual goods no different than for example possessions of a virtual character in an online video game. People may be trading video game gold among each other, people may be buying virtual items with video game gold, people may even be paying real world money for video game gold, but it doesn't make video game gold a real currency in the real world. Bitcoin is the same, it's just a virtual item that is worth only what people are willing to pay for it and it only has value as long as people are playing the Bitcoin "game".

Yo Satoshi I'm really happy for you and I will let you finish, but Ramses had the best pyramid of all time.
