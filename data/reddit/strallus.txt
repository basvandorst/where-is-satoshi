I agree with increasing the block size, but OP's title is not a good reason. It's a fallacy.

Aren't many of the people on YouTube content creators?
Without YouTube and other video services, the barrier for entry to be a video content creator would be much higher.
Without ads, YouTube wouldn't have a dependable revenue stream, and probably wouldn't exist.
Tada. The reason for ads.

While I don't agree with the parent comments conclusion, I do think that things like this are an example of addressing the symptoms and not the cause, which sometimes is counterproductive.

Source on that? I was under the impression he was captured by the US and released... didn't think the coalition killed him (we're both talking about Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, right?).

Apple mice have either two buttons or zero buttons, depending on how you look at it. But never 1.

No sure that different branches of government having different priorities and goals and methods should be called "dysfunctional"...

So then people start programming viruses to live in the chainstate folder?
EDIT: Might still be some confusion as to what I'm saying- I'm not talking about a Bitcoin virus. I'm saying people could put totally unrelated viruses into that folder in order to hide them from virus scanners.

If someone bought the market cap worth of bitcoins, that means they bought all currently mined bitcoins. This is impossible because many bitcoins which have been mined are not available for sale.
Additionally, a single person would now have a monopoly on all currently mined Bitcoin. Thus, the market crashes, BTC lose almost all value, and nobody wants to mine more coins because they wouldn't get transaction fees (because nobody is transacting)

Wat. It does matter what the equivalent is in dollars as long as people use it.

The contact link isn't really dead. The contact link takes you to the main page, which has a "contact us" button on it.

That is literally what it stands for.

EDIT: I don't know who he is banking with, but I just realized that I've paid for a bunch of things online in the U.S. with my British debit card (Barclays if anyone cares).
As an expat living in Britain, this is actually pretty simple if the pizza place accepts payment through PayPal (which a lot do).
You just link your British card to your PayPal and PayPal does the conversion.
Not trying to promote PayPal or rain on BTC's parade, but this isn't necessarily one of the problems that's  best solved by Bitcoin.

There is a risk, yes. With Greece it was a higher than normal risk. But they didn't "know" Greece would default, partially because Greece was lying about their financials.
And whose fault is it if they default?? Is that actually a question? It's *always* the debtors fault. Always. Greece borrowed money and couldn't pay it back. That is not the fault of the lenders. Did the French and German banks make poor financial/lending decisions? Yes. Is it their fault that Greece wants things they can't afford? Nope.
If Greece didn't want to be beholden to the EU, they shouldn't have elected the piss poor money managers that they did.
The important takeaway here is that Greece is a democracy, and in such a form of government, the people are responsible for the actions of their government. Not much more to say really.
If you don't like what your government is doing, stage a coup. But Greece needs to stop blaming everyone else for a problem that ultimately falls on them.

If Greece had managed their money properly, bailing out the French and German banks would not have been a necessity...

Unless end to end encryption is a factor (where the user has the encryption key), open source is irrelevant.
You're putting data on their servers.
They open source their syncing program, showing you that it is clean.
However, this means nothing. They could use code different from the source code they published, as well as just having an entirely different program running in their servers which scrapes your data.
