1000 bits

I guess digital currency, like Bitcoin.

Thanks! It seems like a very convinient client.

A sad day for norwegian bitcoin users.

Hardware.no have been in contact with the norwegian bank that had justcoin as a customers (DNB). They say they still accept customers dealing with bitcoins. Something is not quite right about justcoin's story.

If you are having problem accessing their website, use justcoin.no instead of justcoin.com. At least that worked for me.

I don't know if you remember the first time you payed a bill in your online bank, but for me that was also hard to figure out. Now I find it very easy. Same applied for bitcoins. Now I have full control of them also, and their easy to use.

What bitcoin client should I as a regular, medium technical user, with a small-medium sized wallet use?

Does a Bitcoin (core) backup contains all change adresses, or will I loose bitcoins by restoring a old backup?
@_date: 2014-11-18 16:08:05
Any news if they will still be operating from Norway?

Seems like they take a nice profit when the difference between buy and sell price is 20 £

Realy like the additional currency. I still miss one feature for this to be a super wallet: Request a certain amout of bitcoin through QR code.

Maby this can help you to understand how banking works, at least in the US:

Thanks.  I guess I would not be missing any of my BTC then :)

Thanks for the heads up:) Best wallet !

I think he's comment need to be gilded before the price crashes

I think using a up to date mobile device with a secure valet is secure enough to store up to 10 Btc, if the seed is stored on paper in a secure place

Does not need to transfer back in USD. Wait for rush to slow down and exchange prices normalise then rebuy bitcoins and send to your wallet.

Its not that bad. A lottery in my country have a chance of 1 to 5,6 million to win first price. So I just have to win 7 of these in a row to be as lucky as finding this specific key.

The target altitude for the fist phase is 550 km according to [wiki]( I read somewhere that the latency should be low enough for online gameplay but I don’t have a source on this.
