Open a Coinbase account and then transfer to gdax (maybe it’s Coinbase pro now) to make a limit buy in order to avoid fees. It’ll take a couple weeks to verify and transfer your money to Coinbase. If you want other cryptos, transfer btc or ether to binance.

It’s my old paper wallet. Still good!

The magic money tree exists... it provides packaging for loans that are sold over and over and over again. A dollar isn't just a dollar anymore.

I found it incredibly eye-opening. And I'm a Chomsky fan. He's an world reknown intellectual at MIT.

FUD fan much? Are you working out of a Russian internet farm? Lol.

I agree. It's very cyclical long term, although the bottoms are generally higher. It's even cyclical daily, where day trading can be fun (not at this moment though!) Just ride out the bottoms, crypto is in its infancy... it has a long way to go!!

Due diligence. How long in business? What's track record? How easy to divest and what transaction rate.

Obviously, this Very Bad Future Prediction will show up for what it is like all the other predictions by noteworthy people in the strip.

Although one yearly pattern is not a trend, the amount of general visibility (mainstream investment news including BTC), relationships like Coinbase and Barclays increasing, and general conversation will create plenty of opportunity for huge increases in BTC price to happen.

As far as hacking goes, Coinbase claims to keep 75% or so of funds offline in cold storage as a response to the Mt. Gox hack. Personally I keep most offline off exchanges, but leave enough to play around with

Dumb dumbs, this is obviously not a sincere post. And has weird interpretation of a female by an immature boy all over it.

What a great way to get publicity. Publish as Satoshi. Who’s gonna verify??

I agree. I liked Assange years ago, saw an impressive interview with Amy from DemNow! and Zizek, interesting exchange among them. But. He's lost in his own denial and blind to self reflection.

I agree it's true, most "fair-minded liberals" (cambridge analytica target criteria) probably FEEL differently now than then, but when you look at the big picture, I think there was a larger intention to sow discord between libs and cons with wikileaks, and the leaks before the 2016 US presidential election points to more discord. I wouldn't be surprised if Assange from the beginning was aligned with Russian intentions. Snowden is in Moscow. Just an observation.

You can make a transaction at market price which is almost immediate but you’ll pay something like 3% of that total transaction. But if you make a calculated prediction on movement of price, you can set a limit price and the transaction will occur if/when the price is reached.

The exchange gets a transaction fee for selling the BTC (unless a limit sell) for USD. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 01:12:10
Make limit buys/sells so you don’t pay a ton in transaction fees
