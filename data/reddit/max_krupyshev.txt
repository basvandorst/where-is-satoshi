ATM is one-way only to buy BTC. But there are plenty services in Ukraine where people can sell BTC for UAH (local currency).
Like: [kuna]( or [utbs]( - design is shitty, but service is ok :)

Interest is growing all the time. Year ago it was a dozen of freaks who was curios. After 5 month conference in Kiev collected 100 people. I'm holding the conference 24th sept in Kiev, will be able to see the progress. :)
Revenue is coming from buy/sell operations. Consultations are free due to educational activities from Bitcoin Foundation Ukraine.
What people need is trustworthy guy in a city who can always sell and buy Bitcoins for local currency with fee &lt;5%.

Could you please see explanation here 
under "OUR HOT WALLET" section.
Simply saying all user funds are in Cold storage, when all withdrawals  (as well as all automated operations) happen from hot wallet. Which is funded only with company own funds.

I can confirm that we have few large mining farms in Ukraine. Their locations are kept in secret. I'm speaking about ~5Phs. Cannot confirm rebel controlled locations.

You can only send wire (swift) bank transfers from Canada. That will take few days for them to arrive.

Hi all.
I'm the founder of Bitcoin Foundation Ukraine.
My name is Max i currently live in Berlin and work for [Cubits]( .
My good friend [Mike]( (co-founder of Bitcoin Foundation Ukraine) opened this Bitcoin Embassy about a year ago. He helps people to understand Bitcoin, advices wallets and has Lamassu Bitcoin ATM which allows visitors to Buy BTC for local currency UAH.
If you have any questions about Bitcoin in Ukraine - just let me know.
UPDATE: Mike is not running the Embassy any more. His former partner does.

Adoption is very low. Ukrainian Bitcoin FB community is only 700 people, I believe 50% of bitcoin users are in this community, so the amount is really small, but fast growing.
Some big players like banks and whale-traders complain that the market is not liquid enough to trade there. So they mostly watch.
Bitcoin late adopters are interested to buy few coins for long term investments. Small traders also switched to BTC/USD due to its volatility.
Government is not restricting you to work with Bitcoin, but "strongly warn about its possible crash". They are interested in technology but don't know how to behave yet. Lawyers are communicating with Government to create legal base for crypto-related assets, but no concrete laws appeared so far.
Typical user is the IT related guy who value financial privacy and interested in technology. + people who want to trade with amounts &lt;$5k + people who send money abroad occasionally.
Hope that helps to understand the market.

Dear itogo.
Its Max from Cubits.
We are working on such a solution. Creating Euro denominated vouchers includes a lot of legal and licensing questions. As soon as we solve them, we will contact you. Unfortunately I can't give you exact estimation on this solution yet.
Best regards.
