More about your private keys .
If a coin forks double make sure you are safe to use your private keys for the airdrop : replay protecion is a must for the forked coin AND THE WALLET/SERVICE YOU USE IS REPUTABLE. 
Remember without replay protection a forked coin will have the same private keys and gives an opportunity to an attacker to reuse the transaction details done on one blockchain on the other blockchain.
The transaction will be valid on both chains

A NEM community member very quickly began sending mosaics to the addresses which stole the XEM. He used these mosaics to tag accounts with the stolen funds, they have since contacted all exchanges which trade XEM so they will not accept deposits from an account with the mosaic used to tag stolen funds.
They are now creating a bot to auto-tag any account that receives the stolen funds and working on a few diffetent solutions should a innocent person receive stolen funds.
Within a few hours they prevented the hackers from ever benefitting from the stolen money.....really interesting I thought.
You can see the hacker account and mosaic used to tag it here:
If the coins are returned to the original account then they can be used again as normal. It is kind of like a burn in limbo, they can't be used by anyone except for the original owners.

Alpine Mining is not interested in bitcoin because the hardware needed to mine it cannot be put to any other use. 
The ‘rigs’ that mine ethereum can easily be adapted to zcash, monero and a range of other digital tokens. Deciding which token to mine each day is a delicate balancing act between the level of difficulty of cracking the algorithms, the current and potential value of the token and how many other mines are competing.

Bad experience on this website. It calls Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core for some reason and presents its fake version of the coin, Bitcoin Cash, as the solution to this invented Bitcoin Core idea. Asked a friend and he told me there is only one Bitcoin and that was very lucky of me because I almost got fooled by this website - I mean, it's the Bitcoin.com website afterall... Such a shame. The .org website is the official neutral website for the real Bitcoin.

*It is a natural human inclination not only to appeal to authority but to see the absence of a leader as an invitation, a "job opening." Bitcoin has resisted this for nine years, but it is still immature and trying to find its potential. What the failure of SegWit2x demonstrated was not that this group won and that group lost, but that consensus is an overwhelming majority system. Without it, you are unlikely to succeed. The question is not whether we will scale, but how. The battles we've faced so far are tiny compared to what lies ahead. The choice you all make between convenience and liberty, between safety and freedom, will open up opportunities for billions tomorrow.*

With paper wallets when the time comes that you want to use it, you need to spend (or import/swipe key into a hot wallet) **all of the value**, always clear the entire balance witha single transaction , never use it again. 
But you can keep adding funds to it over time until you want to use the balance , entirely .
Better still avoid reusing the same paper wallet address for loads of transactions, create another one, that's unless you don't mind leaving a trail.


Rare but possible, do check that the private key work if imported etc.

Yes on principale, but as far as I could tell it was impossible to get anything moving, 1.2 cents lasted for a short moment and shot up to 70 cents basically  &gt;&gt; at once . The platform was ever so sluggish, I could not detect how the buying was going on,  but at the same time the price kept falling fast.
 I could not buy, kind of jammed on controls, did not intend to buy anyway, but tried to see what happens,  nothing worked at my end  just shocked with disbelief, kind of frozen. It looked like an orchestrated crash/transfer to ... fill up this space . 
I personally could not cash out of the exchange, transfers were first delayed then blocked.  Now this doesn't fit with the hacking narrative, or was it  partof its cover up?

Transferring/sending to the  ledger bitcoin  address it s the only step you need to do, but you have an efty fee if you move it from coinbase, you better move it to gdax ( free) then send to the ledger from there, no  fee, fee free.

With the Bitcoin Core client, you can create a transaction to several addresses, transaction fees are on a per-kilobyte basis, multiple outputs in a single transaction are always smaller than in separate single transactions, I believe that Electrum can do that also.
Lighting network will enable to transact for tiny fees and split second validation.

Trends do vary in length and strenght but will at one point eventually self correct up or down, self balancing act. 
As for now, we NOW  need a retracement downwards to form the base for a further uptrend move. then the cycle will repeat itself. So no, it won't keep on rising at this ratio for much longer.

Gold and silver have been suppressed "Tamed" for years and Bitcoin looks like will follow this path too.
The dollar failing may be a way out of this, but it may never happen or take many years to implode and let Bitcoin free to find its real market value.

 *Change addresses are not handled which leads to screw ups.*
*Users have been known to import the private key into software wallet and then spend part of the funds. They mistakenly believe the remaining funds are still on the paper wallet when in reality they are in a change address*.

Hi diydude2, that's possible as I don't know your life history,  I had my 1st hand experience with MtGox in 2014, not much of an inspiring one I must say, does that count ?.
However humble it was, what I have learnt since then is that in crypto the past has been a great place for learning but not a place to base and foresee the future of Bitcoin.
 Never confuse belief with the ego illusion of knowledge, Bitcoin bulls and bears have an uncanny way of arriving unannounced when the least you are expecting them. We are just spectators of this exciting game nothing more.

IMHO, chain splits by diverging proposals are the biggest future threats, loss of confidence in the immutable issuance of coins could hurt BTC dominance.
BTC does not have a 'Leader' or a unique central team like other coins, that's its strength for now, at the same time it could become its weakness if the community disagree on the path it needs to follow.

*The pump and dump over the past weekend is a great example that bitcoin cash is a centralized coin. When it crashed from 2500 to 1100 within minutes, the pumpers were profiting greedily from average joes. If a centralized coin controlled by a group of corporate miners can succeed in destroying bitcoin, then the whole crypto space will be in jeopardy!!!﻿* Ian c

18 months in crypto is a very long time, I understand that LN needs smart flawless coding + testing layers, I am sure that takes loads of effort, Core can't just run it before it can walk it.
But if we want BTC to keep its dominant role, LN need to be fast tracked to a much, much shorter time frame. However, If that's not possible, lets be prepared for a slow but unavoidable decline.

How I wish you were correct on this. LN needs Segwit full acceptance to be successfully implemented + wallets developed, exchanges and businesses readiness, realistically a sizable adoption won't happen in 3 months or even 18 months. 
LT Testnet is not a working space for normal usage.If it was going to be ready in 3 months BTC would be AT LEAST already over $10.000, and that's being conservative.

If you click on the three dots icon in the top right of the screen, in any coin's Overview tab in Coinomi, you see an option to "Sweep Wallet". This is a very different process from "Importing" a private key.
*When you're importing a private key, the coins are visible and accessible from both the source and the destination wallet (the wallet the key was exported from, and the wallet the key was imported into), and can be spent from either wallet.*

*I am invested in LTC and NMC, but I wouldn't necessarily consider that a prediction or stock pick  ;-)  I expect that some of the off-blockchain transactions will involve bitcoin holders ("bitcoin banks") who have fractional reserves only.

Thanks, I agree on the exchanges shit privacy issue, it is a double edged sword.
Atm's have cams and most require IDs. Mycelium requires you to know how to back up your keys etc, trust an unknown local trader and only recently introduced segwit.
Bisq has very limited trade right now, especially for GBP andit is not easy for a newbie to handle. 
For a small purchase, $100s  I still think Coinbase is fine &gt;&gt; to start with, if you are talking of buying $1000s+ then decentralized exchanges and p2p are ideal, but again, not a beginner choice IMHO.

Solutions will be found, but if we look at your calculation:
You are missing that within this time frame there would be births and deaths, but births will add more users without removing dead people  values.
So even if population does not increase we need to proportionally increase the numbers of years from 68. By how much ? I guess at least double.

$25.25 Withdrawal you get $15, the  fee stays the same for a $Mil, how fucking stupid and they batch it in large pools making a huge profit, with segwit even bigger profits for THEM.

Segwit yes. but **bech32** please. But none available Apps, only desktop is Electrum, so what the fck are we going to use?
There are zero Apps with segwit Bech32 (Starting bc1) out yet. Samourai wallet uses the Segwit P2SH addresses,(Starting 3). Bech32 addresses are natively SegWit compatible. This means the transaction does not need extra space to put SegWit in the P2SH address.
Bech32 addresses have several advantages over the old Base58 addresses: the QR code is smaller, the protection against typing error is stronger, it enables auto completion, and due to only consisting of lower cases it should be easier to type and to be understood when read aloud.
An address that starts with 1 is a "regular" Bitcoin address that is used by P2PKH transactions
An address that starts with 3 is a P2SH address that is commonly used for multi-signature transactions
So far bech32 is only available for Electrum wallet. It takes time and loads of testing to roll out something bugs free.
Trezor and Ledger hardware wallets are bech32 enabled.
The upcoming desktop Core 0.16 wallet will be the release with full UI bech32 Segwit, and then we will see more wallets adding the bech32 implementation.

Mostly, (With reasonable exceptions):
Whales are the fuckers
Traders (Whales category) make big money when it goes up and down, 
but hodlers ONLY when it goes up. 
Traders can manipulate the market and will do it all the time, 
hodlers sit and watch praying and hoping. 
Traders don't give a fuck about BTC technology, 
hodlers do give a fuck because they see the price increase.
Predictions or fud don't count shit and good news are not as paramount as they used to be.
So if you are not a Whale, get used to bending over and rejoice when times are on your side, there is nothing you can do about it, so relax and go with the flow or get out.

Thanks, the video shows coinbase, I assumed gdax, my Italian/Spanish is basic.
Essentially we know whales spread a large sell across platforms to keep the price as high as possible. 
Whales in their interest do talk to each other (telegram group with signals etc) and do plan together how to manipulate the market. 
The downtrend was planned and started right at 9.8k, wash, rinse and repeat has been going on for quite a while now. 
So the  trading software this guy uses groups sells together over the exchanges, that is quite valuable as to define the coming trend, will be looking in to it. 
Then again unless you are a whale in the group you cannot be sure if a major wall is fake or real.
How the fuck do you acces that?

@_date: 2018-02-22 12:36:28
Segwit come in different flavor.
Segwit wallets that support "native SegWit addresses," also called bech32 
Why use base32 at all? The lack of mixed case makes it more efficient to read out loud or to put into QR codes. It does come with a 15% length increase, but that does not matter when copy-pasting addresses. These are the future.
SegWit addresses, specified in BIP173 using a format called Bech32. They begin with 'bc1'.
Addresses that begin with a 3 are P2SH addresses, an address format that has been around for over 5 years now. They were originally used by multisig wallets like CoPay and GreenAddress, which only saw limited usage. However, SegWit can also be used in compatibility mode, using the existing P2SH format, so that old clients can send to it. This gave rise to the myth that '3' addresses are specifically for SegWit.

Maybe you went into Bitcoin for the wrong reasons and possibly bought at the top. Bitcoin it's not a quick get rich scheme. Trading is a secondary part of it that will balance itself out once it really goes mainstream. 
I can't complain, (this is my third user name),  but have been in this space for 6 + years. I have seen dreamers coming and going from this forum and others too, the one month Lambo guys have gone silent for now. 
Reality always gets you at the end. Bitcoin will win, only matter of time. Try a casino roulette for a faster disappointment. FWIW turn anything about BTC off for a couple of months, stop chasing the price and enjoy life, you'll be fine.

This is why it can't work  :*Sorry buddy but that's not how exchanges work. I guess you don't buy on exchanges only on coinbase or you would know this. You can put in an order for twice the price but it will get filled at the current price because exchanges fill most beneficial order first not what you desire. If you try and put in a triggered order at a higher price it won't really matter much because all that will do is create a hidden order that no one will see other than the exchange and it won't get filled until the price actually goes that high. The manipulators will still just keep the price low until after their options expire.﻿*
