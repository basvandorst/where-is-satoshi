Thanks daleb, you got it. 
Also, how and why is your points/score hidden?
@_date: 2018-08-26 20:03:22
Didn't say they didn't have experience. At least the man have some experience using it. 
Also, I didn't ask if it was a good gift to give or not. I asked how I should give it.

Yeah, you're kinda right. It's not money, it's more like gold. And who gives gold on a wedding. Now wait a minute... ah never mind explaining for some.

Wow! I'm astonished by the lack of competence in this thread. 
Did I ask for advice about *what* to give as a gift or *how* to best package a Bitcoin gift? Hmm.. Maybe not incompetence here, maybe just lack of reading skills.

Thanks

You never thought about the virtue of elaborate your standpoint?
@_date: 2018-08-26 20:08:12
As I wrote, I have no experience in multisig.

How's your experience with Bitwala going? How would your rate the different cards now when I few months have passed?
@_date: 2019-02-13 20:45:43
Would you have more info on this?
@_date: 2019-02-22 11:46:47
Thanks! Will look into it.

I wonder how safe we are in Germany, Sweden, and Denmark. Before this KYC enforcement I thought LocalBitcoin was a semi anonymous service on the net without authority connections.

You really think that people can't store their private keys privately? ��‍♂️
