The rise in demand for bitcoin in Korea is obvious as well. This week, all stocks and assets with the exception of one bitcoin investment firm and a few biotech firms have declined due to Brexit. Korean exchanges have also been experiencing spikes in daily volumes. With Yuan devaluating and demand rising in neighboring Asian countries, outlook on bitcoin is definitely positive.

The Australian government seized these bitcoin a long time ago. They held it because of "regulatory process" but the truth is, the government kept their bitcoin until it increased in value. The seized bitcoin was only worth hundred thousands when they first got their hands on it

I'm doubtful that news.bitcoin.com will be able to offer objective coverage with journalistic integrity on bitcoin with this philosophy. You shouldn't take anyone's side if you an actual journalist or a news company. Offer objective coverage and facts only. If you're completely disregarding Core and others, you're not a bitcoin news company but a Bitcoin Unliminted marketing firm.

This is what's wrong with the whole financial crisis = everyone will use bitcoin equation. If people are smart enough, they'd be using bitcoin already. The people that suffer from financial crisis refuse to hold bitcoin because they don't believe in financial innovation &amp; change. They know Bitcoin is an alternative, they just don't want to admit it.
