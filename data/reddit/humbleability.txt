Still so optimistic. Try three to six years.

Good points. The bubbles were probably built up by scammers. But also wouldn't you agree that that FOMO and those bubbles have grown the space? Young millennials aren't conditioned to believe the same lies that their parents believe. TARP happened. The economy was on the brink. Read the Genesis block. The rich were bailed out. Bitcoin is how millennials will take back power from their corrupt overlords enslaving them with student debt.

Agree. Isn't losing all their money to scammers the best financial education, though? Nobody is getting burned by this market again. How many suckers are left? Everyone has heard of Bitcoin. How many years (if ever) is it going to take to see 20k again? Let alone 10k. Wasn't Amazon's bear market something like 10 years?

Stop trying to shill your shitphones, shill.  
If some new blockchain cryptocurrency threatens Bitcoin would Bitcoin be able to change to become more like its competitor? I suppose it depends on how fundamentally different the new implementation is? I mean the Bitcoin of today is quite different than the Bitcoin of 5 years ago, no?

Hey, can't profit until these weak hands capitulate at the bottom
@_date: 2018-11-26 03:22:13
That's a factor in its value. Can you explain to me why that's not true? If a coin is known as that fad all the kids lost their money on it will result in low price. If it's that thing that everyone is gonna get rich of off the price will go up. Isn't Bitcoin a bit like a multi level marketing scheme in that respect?
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:59:46
Smart. Strong hand here forcing capitulation.
@_date: 2019-01-02 23:32:05
Yeah, I agree. I've read about some malware that detects Bitcoin addresses and replaces it with an attacker address while I copy paste, so my Bitcoin gets sent to the attacker instead of me. And seen screenshots of guys who mistakenly flipped the fees and transaction and gave all their Bitcoin to miners. Tbh I trust coinbase/binance security more than myself. Plus if I lose my hardware wallet I lose my coins, right? I understand mtgox happened, but isn't there any risk with taking coins off exchange?
@_date: 2019-01-02 23:48:59
So what could happen if I don't do this tomorrow? Coinbase doesn't have the Bitcoin and turns out I can't actually withdraw my Bitcoin and the exchange fails and I lose all my holdings? That seems less likely than me screwing up and losing all my crypto savings through some silly user error like uploading to some scam hardware wallet or getting screwed by some malware that I don't understand. Is there anything special about the date besides the 10 year anniversary? Is there some sort of forking or halvening event I need to be worried about?
@_date: 2019-01-02 23:40:12
Yeah, agreed. This whole proof of keys thing really highlights how nascent this technology really is. I understand that many Bitcoiners are distrustful of banks, but does this mean I need to go buy a fireproof safe/safe deposit box and multiple hardware wallets so I can store my hardware wallets in multiple locations?

Lol better to keep 20 percent than lose it all.
@_date: 2018-11-26 06:33:59
The housing market slowing down in a lot of these insane markets just means the rate of increase slows. Compare that to Bitcoin where people are losing 80%.

Crypto currency branding is hugely important. The value of the network is the number of others on the network. Those coins were probably just copies of Bitcoin that provided no new innovation and as such were unable to survive. Just like the value proposition for switching to self driving will have to be many orders better than manual driving, for another coin to supplant Bitcoin with its network effect and first mover advantage it'll require far better tech.
Sounds like the market has reached deep into your psyche with all this lashing out. Indicator that we've hit bottom? Doubtful.
@_date: 2018-11-26 04:35:49
I'm not invested in this market to the point where I'm in over my head, but why shouldn't I sell now? The bottom keeps dropping. How long before (if ever) it goes back up? I mean Amazon took 10 years to match the dot com bubble price.
I could be putting my money into a down payment on a house instead of watching it wither away to nothing.
