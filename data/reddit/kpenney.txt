I'm down,  but can someone help my issues out with eclair and the LN node I'm trying to set up? I guess what I'm getting at and even admit to partially myself, is since I've been in this ecosystem since 2017 it seems most people are just riding off the coat tails of the progress and products made in this space, and mostly just the overall progress of bitcoins decentralized growth. Anyways, someone help me with my issue? Running recent version of eclair and bitcoin core, can't open a channel, just keeps failing and saying 
"Channel creation cancelled, took too long". Can't find anything about the error online :(
I'm sure this isn't meant to be a tech support post but help a brother decentralize this bitch a bit more. Let's start doing instead of talking.

Peter thinks retailers are more likely to start measuring, cutting and authenticating gold in their stores before they accept bitcoin- which is fucking ludacris thinking.

the recent IRS outline iirc they've designed the rules to essentially double tax you. So as soon as you sell, that's taxable, when you buy, pretty sure that's taxable too. Oh yeah if you get an airdrop of any coin even if you don't want it, selling those airdropped coins is another taxable event.

What I'm getting at is I thought there was a general consensus on what seemed good for bitcoin and what was probably shitting where you drink, but I'm not that butt hurt if people disagree here, I think I'm just trying to remind myself and others that r/bitcoin isnt the pinnacle of probably about 90% of the other sentiments not shared openly.

I think the price sways now have less to do with overall manipulation and more around the presumption more people are margin trading then ever before, which makes the price easier to swing one way or another based on less people buying and selling now, essentially tanking the price or making a big green dildo with less money now then before.

At least dont talk about it 24/7. Its fine to have a small conversation like youd have around speculation of gold, but if you talk about it too much it makes people think it's more for you and less for them. A coworker a few months ago asked me questions about use cases for bitcoin, his concerns had already been addressed and he was just ignorant to the news and facts, now hes a little bit more on the boat. In 2017 he was not at all on the boat, figured bitcoin could be shut down.
@_date: 2019-11-12 19:09:43
Yeah if the bank wants to convert my btc to fiat or vice versa and send me on my way with my own property in hand- well this would be revolutionary for banking. But crypto bank accounts with the RBC is a massive nono in my books. The RBC has done horrible things to myself, my family, and friends of my family threw borderline illegal actions such as changing policies without any prior notification or agreements from the customer. I don't see this being a good end result for true adoption of crypto.

It's not that their treating it the same as gold, it's that some people are feeling that they'd rather hold something that isnt going to hyper inflate. OP is bold, but I feel the same way. The world markets are on threads right now, but to be frank it may not happen the way some of us are thinking it will.
I'd certainly rather hold bitcoin this upcoming recession then fiat holdings, stocks, anything. Also it will be the first global recession or possibly depression that bitcoin will ever see.

So you close your Santander account out yet and switch banks? 
I personally find credit unions more willing to let their customers choose their own destinies. The most my local credit union has ever done to block me from buying coin was pause on one wire transfer because SWIFT accounts had changed since my last wire, so they called me and there wasn't really any problem and it simply delayed my transfer by a few hours. But I don't buy using credit cards, just wires or in person.

Yeah reality is a real volatile market right now. Honestly I just hope my bitcoin goes a lot longer of way then my fiat holdings ever have. Total shitcoin, devs just keep inflating the price by fucking with the supply, and they suck at keeping anything stable from build to build. Every time they make a press release about an upcoming patch people panic sell their smart contracts, just look at DJi and SPx recently, they should have deployed on a proper blockchain. What a mess of a network, and people keep thinking "it's fine! Itll always work out!", totally ignoring the fact the devs own each other with trillions in debt, and they just keep borrowing more while minting more coins, its ludicrous.

@_date: 2019-08-02 22:38:03
Tldr warning: after the first paragraph I'm just speculating and throwing out my beliefs in the future. 
Markets always contract and expand, I'm not trying to speculate how many threads are left but I'm saying it's starting to run its contraction cycle globally. It's been like this for almost 100 years, and every time it contracts it's for a different reason that onsets a fall. Markets have not been too excited globally for these new us china terrafs  that all got spun up recently, and the aggressive economic behavior being displayed by many leaders globally is worrying a lot of folk including average consumers I know in my community. I'm simply speculating a similar scenario occurring as OP, but surely it couldn't play out as were both picturing it. That would just be catastrophic. 
I still stand by my point of IF theres a recession coming up soon, I'd personally rather be as involved in this 'experiment' as it finally would establish if bitcoin has become ready to achieve what satoshi envisioned, something of a recession proof means of value that people especially in lesser situations could use as a means to get by.
 I don't think whoever satoshi was when he started conceiving bitcoin was a person who particularly set out for greed, for personal benefit or to design another tool of greed for others. No one can 'print more bitcoin', and as people have sold more and more over the years, well they dont reap the price benefits of later but it spreads it out more and more. I heard a rumor once that satoshi died in the Japanese tsunami, and therefore his wallet keys are gone. Another rumor that he simply parted with his wallet keys by throwing it over a bridge, thus separating any ability to pervert the concept of his invention. Then I heard there was this crazy australian doctor who claimed to be satoshi, but he wasn't a doctor at all, and he was rich and arrogent as could be- and I figured the first two theories were a lot more plausible. 
Satoshi to me is a saint- and I imagine a lot of you reading this feel the same. I was lucky enough to be taught about the dirty fiat and banking systems when I was in highschool, had a brother who felt the same but thought gold was the actual answer. To me theres no other option in life thinking forward, I mean of course right now until any market contraction really sets in, I'm going to keep using my dirty fiat that I'm paid with to buy my cheese and crackers, but if shit hits the fan I'm glad my cold wallet is ready to go, cuz daddy loves his cheese and crackers and I'll be damned if they stop showing up on my store shelves.

Your concept that money needs to be inflationary  and if not will have an infinite supply is hurting my head. It's too early in the morning to be reading that lol.
I think everyone else probably pointed you straight but no, money doesn't need to be inflationary to work, and also if something can inflate then it can run on forever with an unlimited supply. Besides bitcoins divisable by 10 millionths,  dollars are divisable into 100 cent, this is why it primarily doesn't need to be inflationary to work in scale at least from what I gather.

People dislike btc because usually its inciting a heavy change in their financial lives that they dont want to have to take on.
 The thing I find that spreads adoption the most like it or not, is mentioning bitcoin even to people who dont like it. Your confirming it's a real thing, theres rules and information to learn. I had a friend who when I first got into crypto, a) was reciting false facts about cryptocurrencies back to me, especially bitcoin and I had to fight to correct him on. And b) absolutely thought it would be near 0 in 24 months from then.
 It's been 24 months roughly since that discussion, around Christmas last year we spoke again and his tune had changed, he said he had done more reading and admitted he was wrong, blockchain technologies at least were in this for the long run and could really be the future of money. The guys been a charter accountant for a few years now with a business major.
 When I first heard of bitcoin myself, it sounded like trouble to me mostly because at that time in my life I had a lot more faith in the systems of the world, I was not much if any of a risk taker. I could have mined initially around 2011 with a helluva computer I built with my own student loans, I was in animation college when i heard about two seniors to me getting expelled for mining bitcoin one night with the animation computers. In Hindsight I wish that was me, then I preferred slaving away with a private college that essentially robbed me and tried to steal my work as part of the contract with the school. I kick myself every morning now for not taking those risks years ago. Since its inception I had heard off and on about bitcoin, in the beginning I thought it wouldn't be more then a fad, my room mate at the time even told me about this cryptographer email list he was part of hahahaha, him nor I thought much of it other then I remember on a Sunday morning smoking a joint with him while he was telling me about this 'bitcoin thingie, software, whatever it 8s'.
Regret is what eventually drives haters to appriciate bitcoin, it took me about 8 years to turn to the almighty orange savior, but I couldn't accept reality in any other way now and I'm thankful every day for satoshi

I figure a properly set up coinomi wallet on a phone is enough, just make sure she understands that the more so important backup key is in the wallet seed phrases. After she gets familiar with one wallet I'd just recommend buying her a hardware wallet. I really cant see any safer and still mostly idiot proof ways then hardware wallets for long term storage of btc. Get her a hardware wallet as an early Christmas gift and write on the label "you'll thank me pretty soon, hodl up!". 
I'm partly joking but not really on that last part but I'm in the camp that were absolutely heading into a recession or depression that could last quite some time, and you should shake out crypto related xmas gifts real early this year.

Yeah there was a couple people who I had to clarify that too, I told them options to buy fractions of a btc. The same people are now aware how to sink a few hundred dollars (these are literal retail workers, they're not in positions to risk lots) anyways the thought ball is rolling with them all now.
One thing I considered but I'm a bit lazy was writting up a small guide and printing it off on a single sheet of paper, like who they can trust and what to expect when purchasing. A lot of them are simply nervous and lacking confidence with working with cryptocurrencies. Using them, storing them, buying them. I relate it to the very first time any one of them ever used an ATM in their lives, it was awkward, you weren't positive if you were using it right, and it probably was a very nerve racking experiance, after a couple times using an atm it becomes pretty simple, you become more confident and courageous with what your doing. Buying crypto is really no different.

Yeah just a friendly reminder to take alt coin profit whenever possible and not sit on it too long, alt coins simply dont pave the way and usually their communities die out and capitulate to btc and sats. In 2017 I wasted so much time beating around the bush with alts it burnt me so hard, in hindsight even if I put the majority of my funds in to btc I'd still be up more now then I am. Very few alts do much in the long run, and you can usually buy them to speculate off of later at a lower price then you would have paid and to kept hodling them. Basically lesson learned sometimes the hard way, but btc paves ground and everything else follows suit long after. To be honest it was xrp that brought me into this market, and I was so blind to ride that train as long as I did. Dont hate me, I'm just being honest but especially when Brad garlichouse as hes referred to sided with trump and the treasury secretary saying bitcoin was bad and shilling his own company saying bitcoin did bla bla bla, I sort of threw up in my mouth. Alt coins are like a poison, fine if you use them for gains like almost like an assasin- but very bad for you if you end up even accidentally ingesting then, or even simply *drinking the cool aid.*

Well having a small convo with merchants about accepting bitcoin and what you can do with it I don't think is too bad, but if they seem disinterested then don't at all continue talking about it. Generally if I bring it up the person asks what can they do with it and seem generally surprised that it has x function or can perform in a certain way after we get threw the semantics of joking around. That said don't start conversation with complete strangers, the merchants I speak with I have a bit of previous history with and they know me well.

Look up a chart on the value of gold since the dark ages in usd, it's practically impossible as the measurement of value has changed repeatedly since that time, catastrophic events like famine, plaque, war have changed peoples perception of value since that time.
And this has me thinking, imagine 140 years from now when bitcoins about 150 years old, what will be the perception of value then of probably sats to usd? I don't think people will have an easy time coming up with an answer, I'm sure if you found enough data and thought long enough you could come up with a chart of Usd to gold from before christ to now, but it's only going to be a estimation anyways and not proven easily. 
But everything has a beginning in comparison of valuation based on whatever the medium of exchange happens to be at the time of its inception.

When those lines last crossed though, oh boy, didn't matter what the recent trend was, broke the fuck right out. 2k dip in 2 or 3 days means nothing in the long run. In the future I'm predicting btc to go up and down in thousands per day/week.

Short sighted returns is what I've come to gather as a strong possibility. I'd say I'm in it for the tech but people would probably call me a pussy.
I like bitcoin dont get me wrong but the social media behind it these days is starting to feel like it's doing it overall more harm then good, again in the short term. I think bitcoin will be worth moon lambos some day; that is when we have moon colonies and moon charging or service stations to accommodate. I just think moon lamboers need to be way more realistic and come back to earth before they plan on shipping cargo they dont own to a destination they can only ever dream to afford, then maybe we'll start seeing more rational adoption for a better lack of words.

Was talking with a whale friend I havent seen since two christmases ago. He's very much betting on another step down to around low 6k high 5k, maybe even a point where we see low 5k for a brief time. We agreed that when bitcoin starts its next climb past 20k the price is going to take a lot of folks by surprise. An almost seamless jump in a short time between 8 or 9k to somewhere well over 20k in a matter of days. But at the end of the day we just agree we'd rather hold bitcoin when the next global recession hits rather then fiat.

This guy doesn't understand consensus. Blockchains work and people put faith in them because the majority of participants that are forming consensus are not trying to maliciously hurt the chain they're trying to work with, if 51% of miners are good then you don't need to worry about bad actors manipulating the chain for their own selfish reasons. It's sort of similar to society,  if the majority of people want a certain rule, the rule is made and its expected that the other 49% will follow it if they wish to still partake in the society.

I guess what I mean is in the age of hyper information it's getting really hard to keep up with things. I love btc, but I cant be researching it 24/7 and tracking down good examples of how to properly integrate it and how it works. What I'm getting at I guess is that it's more riskier to businesses especially small businesses to try and start working with these things without some well laid out examples of how to set them up. Your totally right that figuring out btc core wallets and full nodes is pretty easy, I did leave that out, but overhead with small business is sometimes sparse, and without the owner having an almost surefire visualised how-to setup with a lot of these layers, I find that's a very specific issue with adoption. I hate to say it but it's almost like there needs to be a form of Btc-stable for merchants---- I dont even know how that would work, perhaps even just a better version of btc to fiat conversion for merchants for the time being. But when merchants work with btc, they are playing a little bit with fire by the time they can convert it for payments to regular bills, or taxes.

That's kinda steep but in the world of hedge funds it doesnt actually sound too bad for buying into a entirely new asset class, that in such a realm is backed up with assloads of insurance and custodians. You pay for quality in the world of digital gold, at least these guys cant just up and exit scam. This is just more reason to trust into bakkt, while its certainly not designed for retail buyers of bitcoin, it suits parties of investors quite well and shows that they need fiat to properly accommodate their own overhead.

No my dear friend, youd be surprised to know how many people I've met who don't understand this. I mean some think it's all still backed by gold or some other precious metal.
 Iirc central banks back their money now with a 2 to 1 ration, where they reserve double printed and uncirculated money parallel to what they're calculating is legal tender in circulation now. Someone correct me if I'm wrong by all means.

I understand that but what I'm getting at is the idea of futures aren't a very progressive concept in speculative thinking, it's like after hours lotto essentially except with things like bitcoin, there's no after hours. So really bitcoin futures make no lick of a sense.

I'm just too cautious to be risking position on an asset like bitcoin by swing trading it. Also I have patience and  do not use the capital I put into btc in my day to day, month to month, or even year to year life. But were two different people with different strategies. I'm only writing this to show others there's all sorts of ways to play and speculate on this market, and I think no ones wrong if you're at least perceivably accomplishing your long term goals.

You could use the core wallet too just by itself. It is a hot wallet but it's something to start with and learn around on your PC. You can also use apps on your phone like coinimi. I don't suggest holding vast amounts of coin on either but of your starting with 20 usd worth of bitcoin it's like learning how to use an atm for the first time. You need to build up your own confidence with using this stuff and certainly you'll probably make a couple mistakes, maybe even get scammed potentially where you'll learn even bigger lessons after the fact about how to be your own custodian. 
Tldr: get yourself a hardware wallet in the not too distant future, perhaps once you've got about 100 usd worth of bitcoin, then save up and buy something. Trezor, ledger whatever- then learn how that works and you should be alright in terms of knowing what the hell your doing to some degree to keep your coin safe.

That all the layers are still confusing, I mean things are getting better, but lighting is still a bit tricky to get set up, it's not really idiot proof. But most importantly theres no user friendly and open source collection of all btc layer tech, how you can use certain layers in certain use cases, like a centralized but somehow open source repository of all the relative information about bitcoin. For example I learned about lightning network last year, accidentally bumped into eclair, so I finally figured out eclair, but then theres btcpayserver and that looks good too, but honestly what's available and what's publically known is getting a bit out over the heads of some people.
I just want some sort of site or community of sites that all propagate education to users who want to essentially start jamming all about the world of bitcoin into their brains.

My local gym accepts bitcoin. Since the overheads mostly already covered when a gym opens, it's easier for them to work with it. They've been accepting it since summer 2017. Seriously it makes sense for gyms to take crypto if the owners also in the speculative crypto game themselves, which is why my local gym did it mostly. 
I could certainly use the gym time rather then holding bags of shitcoins, certainly more beneficial of an investment. That seems like an almost inarguable fact.

I didnt know that, now that's steep! Futures are so dumb though, especially on this trump tweet futures. And even knowing about the weathers futures.

Like 95% of crypto related articles. Most crypto writers are just racing to create clickbait and fill them with opinion. It's not just crypto writers either but when your dealing with a speculative asset as fresh as bitcoin, you can practically write whatever you want someone's going to end up reading the whole thing or at least giving the ad revenue to the site, and perpetuate the nature of shitty opinion journalism.

Honestly, I don't mean to just rag on binance alone but as a westerner I'm not at all a fan of their practices. I remember when they launched everyone thought they were the be all end all of exchanges, but all I've ever seen is copied models from other exchanges, dressed up and with their own house rules that are more akin to a casino then the 'terrible bank like practices' of the competitor and older exchanges--- except poloniex doesnt try to incentivize you to stock up on in house centralized own brand shitcoins, for all these great reasons like steaking them for ICOs/IEOs/whatever you want to call them, or so you can get discounts on buying and selling other shitcoins, transfering coins from their exchange to 'wave EXTRA fees' that when you calculate it out, no other exchanges dare charge.
So this article aside, some of us westerners have already been scrutinizing them from their own actions in the past, that when mentioned amongst other parts of the crypto community were downplayed as our own issues, and that the exchange was perfect, especially charging abnormal fees with coupling of incentivizing binance coin. Perhaps the fees have changed but I could give a flying fuck now to risk even my time researching, let alone any coin to find out.
And just to mention it again; CZ wasnt initially joking when he wanted to roll back BTC to fix binances own security issues, he was sleep deprived obviously but that whole "he was joking thing" didn't come until the next day. Seriously CZ in my eyes is nothing but a man already ruined by greed. Perhaps in the future him and his company can rework themselves and earn people like myself's trust again, but with continued bad behavior in this community hes starting to piss me off more then the obvious pyramid/ponzie scheme of bitconnect did.
