In the LTC community. He sold at different prices during different times, he even made public all the data. And he never abandoned the project but quite the opposite, he even bought a German bank just to give extra support to Litecoin.
So yeah, I think I have been more IN than you troll, now go back to your corner.

IPO= Initial Public Offering. Think about ICOs but for the traditional market where a company sells it's shares in order to raise cash but accepting shareholders in return.
And Bitmain was one of the head players against Bitcoin, Litecoin and Vertcoin getting Segwit. They were ready to take down the ship if Segwit was activated. They are one of the main promoters or Bitcoin Cash. They sold most of their Bitcoins for Bcash and now they are in trouble since pretty much nobody is buying Bcash.

the safe move is to hold, the risk move is to sell. More risk means more gains or more loses. It is up to you to decide. You do not lose anything if you hold, only when you sell you will either win or lose.

VTC Is decentralized, has segwit, and has the fairest mining distribution because ASIC does not work on it. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 01:03:06
And so it is Bitcoin and all coins that charge a fee since Nano exist, with your same logic
@_date: 2018-10-05 18:11:00
Would you like to develop your idea? How is it dead? It is moving millions and it is getting added to Gemini in less than a week. What is your criteria to call a coin "dead"?
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:42:04
Segwit will not allow 84 million litecoins being added, the atomic swapping does not work like that. Its purpose is to unite the hash power, and decentralize it, it is convenient for all three coins (btc/ltc/vtc) because it will lower fees for everyone and will take power out of the chinese miners.
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:47:21
dont be a fool, this decentralizes the network on all three coins, it takes power from the Chinese and it makes the networks even more secured. It is a win-win for everyone
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:19:42
I made more with litecoin than Bitcoin, but I was not an early early adopter so meh I'm still happy

I am a huge crypto fan, and love bitcoin the most, but honestly for small purchases it sucks. Litecoin, dash, ripple are better for that. Hopefully once the lightning network and atomic swap is enabled, we can enjoy sending money around for close to nothing.
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:45:55
other coins took it! look at Vertcoin's price almost 100% up
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:21:54
Yes and to Vertcoin as well. It will decentralized all networks, and take power out of the Chinese miners, making all networks more secured.
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:01:09
Bitcoin and litecoin will get anonymity. No need for monero in the long term

Not a professional advise here. Legally, you are responsible for paying taxes, although it is very hard for IRS to follow your income in Bitcoin unless you tell them. From my personal experience, I have never paid taxes from my crypto gains, and I have never gotten in trouble and I know plenty of people doing the same. But again this is by far not a professional advise.
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:58:51
Bitcoin is expensive to move. This is a great thing because it allows it to store wealth.
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:15:47
the new cryptocurrency era just started btc/ltc/vtc will rule over all other coins FUCK YES! :D
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:06:06
Yes it is possible, they require something else to work in atomic swapping, can't remember the name of that property but it is not the algorithm to mine it. Vertcoin is getting atomic swapping as well with Bitcoin and litecoin
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:45:09
Despite what has been told, Litecoin has a better security against 51% attacks in its network. I think atomic swapping will make all three coins' networks more secured and more decentralized, and I am all about that.
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:22:55
The price is wrong though 
@_date: 2017-01-18 03:09:11

so all of these exchanges do not look at the background of every coin they list, even the exchanges that serve US people like poloniex or kraken, they just say "oh lets add this token that is backed up 1:1 with USD because we are cool". You dont think that any of those companies can get into liability for doing something as stupid as that? I am just asking because I want to have a rational discussion, not because I am calling you wrong, but I want to understand this from all point of views.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:46:39
I'm pretty sure litecoin and Vertcoin will get it first to test the waters, once everything looks safe Bitcoin will do it as well. I believe litecoin should be getting the lightning network before the years end. But I can be completely wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:45:04
but do you think they would investigate or ask bitfiniex for audit reports before allowing customers to trade with USDT? You do not want to speculate if other exchanges scam people but only Bitfiniex? I am trying to get an unbiased answer here. I am by far not trying to defend Bitfiniex but before I can believe in this conspiracy theory, I need answers.

Fork it! Say it's because you are tired of core and made the blocks bigger! You are a guaranteed millionaire just make sure you have a company that makes miners with ASIC boost and it is compatible with your coin, or even better say you are creating an ASIC resistance coin, copy paste Vertcoin and say it was yours from the beginning, premine 200,000 coins and sell them to the noobs who believe they are buying gold.

Atomic swapping with coins like ltc it's the best way being developed and you can do this in some exchanges, otherwise use segwit transactions. Segwit transactions are cheaper.

I'm so tired with all these conspiracy bullshit, people don't stop to think. Ok so if Bitfiniex if issuing more tethers than they should, and tether is a scam, why do other high quality exchanges like binance, poloniex, hitbtc, kraken are using tether! Nobody stops to think about that shit. Yezzzz
@_date: 2019-02-24 19:22:30

so do you think that poloniex, bitfiniex, bittrex, huobi, binance, hitBTC among others are all scamming people through tether or only Bitfiniex, and all the other companies have not audit or talked to bitfiniex before giving USDT support on their platform?
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:02:02
What a dumbass thing to do
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:50:14
That will not be profitable, if you MacBook has nvidia try mining Vertcoin, or try mining through nicehash or prohashing. Mining btc requires ASIC equipment.

Because it works!
Their strategy works, it scams people, very noob people or stupid people.
The only reason why BcH is in so many exchanges is because Roger Ver bribe their admins. Usually he asks them to enlist BcH and to delist litecoin. Like if somehow BcH was better than LTC or BTC.
Freaking scam.

Just be careful, it will correct. It raised this much because alts when down in anticipation of the upcoming forks, people want their free coins. After this alts will probably raise while Bitcoin will see a correction.

@_date: 2017-05-31 02:24:28
Come to the litecoin side.... We have segwit cookies 
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:08:55
@_date: 2017-05-09 23:53:26
You really wont make a million here in BTC, invest in an alt coin that can have the potential to rise, thats about your only hope. My advice are either Litecoin or Vertcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:14:55
Add this to the coins that went offline all of the sudden..... Maybe it's just all a coincidence but a very scary one
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:06:16
That's a job for a faster coin like litecoin, Bitcoin should be the bank's reserve 
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:38:19
This is what I was talking about: 
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:02:10
the only problem with this, is that people will not have as many coins as they used to have. Depending on how quickly you get to the party, you might cut your coins by half or less.

Macs are not fine... They are the most vulnerable to attacks even more than windows 
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:24:24
Exactly, they complement each other. Check this article: 
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:02:46
There will be Five:
Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin BIP148, Bitcoin bitman
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:35:50
litecoin is cheap, move through it
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:04:15
Right, nobody, not me, not the 2.7k members in telegram, not the Chinese who buy more litecoin than Bitcoin money wise in a daily basis, not the people who makes litecoin the fourth largest coin. No one cares about litecojn
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:27:50
if segwit gets activated in bitcoin, and atomic swapping comes in, then Litecoin and Vertcoin will be able to take care of that
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:56:22
Its smart to diversify and have both coins. It is just the safest option here.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:13:12
I can see Bitcoin being the parking spot, and litecoin being the freeway.
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:18:45
I agree, but explain to me, how you a regular jones who just bought some bitcoins, will be able to upgrade to the new segwit bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:54:33
It is a coin that it is ACIIS resistant, or whatever the name of it is. The coin has surged from costing .03 cents to .60 cents. It has segwit, and it will be interchangeable with litecoin through atomic swapping. Why would I not recommend it to a new commer lol? It is a great coin, great team of development behind it. With the potential to reach at least $10 each.
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:42:36
Whatever dude, you make this community toxic
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:26:49
Litecoin being litecoin
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:04:34
Mind to explain your logic without insulting? Please explain why is litecoin a scamcoin compared to Bitcoin? Give me facts not just your opinion
@_date: 2019-05-31 22:17:43
I wouldn't sell my Bitcoin for gold but it is good to know.
@_date: 2017-06-09 13:55:15
The lightning network that Litecoin is getting? or which lightning network are you talking about? lmao
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:18:31
This is why Litecoin is so undervalued and so many people are starting to realize this.
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:15:06
Yes do it, keep your account safe. I dont know where you live, but there are phones that cost $20 USD with android that you can use for this purpose. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:29:26
I do not recommend having your coins in Electrum if you run Windows or Mac, always use Linux to storage your coins
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:11:58
Or you know, you could just buy some litecoins and enjoy segwit. But yeah it's years apart....
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:44:55
I wish I had the money to buy 1.
Congratulations man
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:46:15
Could be, but then it's not different than Fiat. Who knows
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:54:35
exactly, think like if you are writing an email to someone else, the process goes like this
1. You purchase in bitstamp then you transfer to &gt; Poloniex using a deposit address there
2. Once you receive your money in Poloniex then you can buy other cryptos with it, and if you want your investment to grow, start lending it through their funding option, but thats another whole conversation.
I recommend you that if you want to transfer money do it through litecoin, with litecoin you pay less than a a cent of a few cents to transfer thousands of dollars, with bitcoin you will end up paying dollars, and the same is truth with ethereum. Bitstamp should be adding litecoin this week, so verify your identity in the meanwhile. Add me on telegram if you would like more help, I will PM you my number.
@_date: 2017-06-01 10:38:36
diversify, buy litecoin, they already have segwit, so if after august 1 if it fails, you will be in the winning side already enjoying segwit, if it doesnt fail you will be in the winning side enjoying segwit
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:47:30
Where will you get the UASF coins? 
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:10:50
I will create a video on how to secure storage your litecoins, but it is applicable to Bitcoin as well. But first STOP USING WINDOWS OR MAC these are not secured. I don't care what antivirus you have or what the genius guy told you. These two systems have backdoors, only use LINUX
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:29:21
Lol, I do agree with you :) bitcoin will be the best if it gets lightning and atomic swap, I own both BTCs and LTCs because i believe in them both confidently, we will have to wait and see what happens
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:26:33
I don't really know what exchanges are out there for europe, but I have heard of bitstamp and positive things about it, I will still however buy there and then send it to either poloniex or bitfinex.
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:13:42
That's fine with me
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:29:34
you should not post this in reddit. You are now a bee nest calling for honey badgers. Delete this post, change your passwords and turn your house in fire.... well maybe not the last one.
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:46:38
Up to you, I don't like ethereum but if you do then don't listen to me. I rather trust a decentralized coin
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:48:31
They come from the same code, Litecoin can be considered a Hard Fork from Bitcoin. They are so similar that Yours changed from Bitcoin to Litecoin because precisely, they only had to change a few variables for things to work. Lightning network works on litecoin, because they are almost identical to Bitcoin.
I will invite you to join us at our telegram group 
talk to the people there as well, join the community, make friends, and if it convinces you, buy some litecoins. You do not have to get rid of your bitcoins lol, but understand that litecoin and bitcoin share the same philosophy.
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:57:46
Diversify, buy more crypto, get some Litecoins, Ethereum Classic, Monero, Dash and Vertcoin
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:06:54
Mining on the right side
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:27:16
What makes litecoin a shitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:56:15
if you want something that it is not volatile, you will not find it in the crypto world. USDT could be one of the most stable coins. But again Litecoin is pretty stable and its cheaper way cheaper to send LTCs than BTCs.
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:20:28
Litecoin is like bitcoin, but more handsome.
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:46:49
Users fault for not wanting to use an alternative coin to transfer money. Like litecoin
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:40:03
It all goes depending on how much are people willing to pay for a coin. If you are new, buy a some of the three most majors. Bitcoin, ethereum​ and litecoin. They are all sold in coinbase
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:18:52

I'm not selling anything dude, I'm telling the common person to don't trust Mac or windows, and if they decide to do so, to not come here crying because they got hacked.
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:39:44
Yes encrypt the phone, lock screen, keep it on airplane mode and buy extra battery (make sure your phone has removable battery). For your key, I suggest you to print it into a QR, make copies of this and hide them securely. Think of places where no one would ever bother to look, (IRS paperwork, religious stuff, etc). Thats what i would do for extra security, and make sure that the password is made randomly, not by you.
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:58:36
Sure they are, the fact that you don't like them doesn't mean they are useless don't be stupid
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:14:03
Bitcoin is the original. That is it. It is great way to park your wealth, but not so much to move it around. Ethereum is better for that but Litecoin is even better than Eth to move money cheaply.
If you would like to try segwit, i suggest you to try Litecoin or Vertcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-02 23:12:51
Like litecoin? Extremely low fee (only cents) and 2.5 min per transaction what else do you want?!!!! 
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:29:47
True but I was only saying that it is better for moving, now wallets and exchanges giving it support is a whole different story. I do not like ripple but I have to recognize that taking less than a minute to move it's quiet stunning 
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:01:35
They are ACIIS resistant or however it is spelled. Meaning that you can only mine them with a GPU. It is a fork from Bitcoin so you get the security from it, there is a fixed supply and they got segwit before even litecoin did. Vertcoin and litecoin will soon get lightning network and then after they will both get atomic swapping.
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:30:59
who said anything about growing 32x times lol? I said the compliment each other, never said one is better that the other one
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:20:24
Ethereum? Lol no thanks it's centralized and they have been hacking it lately
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:38:01
1000% agree
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:33:23
BU is a centralized fork from Bitcoin, it is hackable and that's pretty much it, it doesn't bring anything good to the table.
@_date: 2018-12-31 19:46:53
I don't care what the media and haters say.
Bitcoin changes lives for good.
Congratulations to you and your wife man!
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:50:26
Pretty much, unless we get exchanges on board, and they start offering this new segwit bitcoin, and the people move from the old bitcoin to the new bitcoin, unless that happens, we are fucked. Can you just imagine, we are going to have four forks: Segwit Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited. Now go an explain a noob that although he just purchased a bitcoin core for $3k, he bought the wrong bitcoin, explain him that he should have bought Segwit Bitcoin which can be found in another exchange. This is why it gets scary. I really hope we successfully activate segwit but i wish it was through another way.
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:51:46
You will be ok, the IRS does not have your social security number. Stop being paranoid
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:46:34
By being a fixed supplies makes it comparable to gold. It is an analogy. And currently it has not yet being hacked, not like ethereum cough cough 
@_date: 2017-06-01 23:31:58
Lol to be honest I do not know much of it
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:42:04
I m heavily invested in both LTCs and btcs because they compliment each other rather that threat each other. But either I wish you good luck my friend!
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:23:19
Bitcoin core, Bitcoin unlimited, Bitcoin classic and Bitcoin segwit. There will be four
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:54:36
Nope, it has more capacity than BTC and with lightning network coming up, we will never have this issue.
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:44:17
Bitcoin unlimited has a president, it has an organization, they change the way updates come and go, users will not longer vote them in
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:05:17
I feel sorry if you dont like to hear that your beloved macs are less safe than windows. Sheep

@_date: 2017-06-01 03:14:56
Use gdax for that, it's an exchange from the same company as coinbase so you will log in with the same username and password.
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:58:11
transfer your funds to litecoin, then move it out, buy bitcoin once it reaches your destination
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:44:41
True just a worthless clone of litecoin that is the number 4 in market cap lol. Man dont commit the same mistake I made, do not fall in love with only 1 coin. Stop seeing the small picture and step back and look at the whole thing. If you dont want to invest heavily in LTC dont do it. But I will strongly suggest you to at least drop in a few hundreds and then think you lost them. Check back next year and enjoy your thousands
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:06:26
It is a currency backed up by its community, there is no bank or government behind it, and there is a limited number of coins available, which creates deflation compared to Fiat currencies (USD, EUR,etc).
There are multiple kind of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin was the first one to come out and it is still the king. But my favorites are Ethereum Classic, Litecoin and Vertcoin, and of course Bitcoin.
I hope this helps you.
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:33:40
I agree, speculation on a coin only hurts it mid term
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:44:43
Noooo it would cost you a lot to move those bitcoins. Sell your bitcoins for litecoins, then move the litecoins to polo, once there sell your litecoins for Bitcoin and then buy stellar. Seriously I'm saving you some big dollars so buy me a beer
@_date: 2017-06-09 23:11:16
It is not a direct fork, it is a copy of it with changes to the code
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:26:47
And you are very welcome :) 
@_date: 2017-06-09 03:31:56
That's the million dollar question indeed
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:28:22
sorry man, you should storage your wealth in bitcoin and move money around with litecoin. It fees are almost nonexistence in LTC
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:17:35
I always suggest to diversify into Litecoin, its the same as bitcoin, but it already has segwit, and transaction fees are almost zero. Do not jump all in into one currency, but diversify instead.
@_date: 2017-06-06 23:04:18
Not according to the hacking convention where hackers try to gain root access into every OS and mac has been staying in last place under windows, and Ubuntu up on top. Yeah 100% false
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:48:37
Okay please explain then, join the conversation
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:12:32
Dont do that, my advice is that you should diversify, buy litecoin which already has segwit activated, so if in August Bitcoin fails to activate segwit, you are in the winning side, but if bitcoin succeed you are also in the winning side. Diversification is the key my friend. See you at the moon
@_date: 2017-06-04 05:44:58
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:52:10
Get some vertcoins now
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:45:52
Go to bitfinex and buy all of their coins, or save your coins in litecoin. It already has segwit, so you are safe there and potentially you will be in the winning side at the end of this 
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:27:48
Are they in an exchange? Or in your private wallet? If the second option is your answer, sorry there is no way. I recommend you to always keep some litecoins to move money around, also they are good as investment, keep BTC to park your wealth
@_date: 2017-06-08 04:04:55
this would be huge
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:13:46
So the lightning network, or the low fees, or the rsk feature coming up or msk ability aren't interesting enough for you? 
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:44:16
Why should I feel sorry about my self? lol I use Linux haha and it is great!
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:16:59
the true problem will happen at the moment of the split, waiting times will be enormous, so a very very very powerful machine you will need. After the first 2 weeks, we should see the difficulty decrease 
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:16:02
No problem :)
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:55:06
Yeah yeah yeah :) whatever you say sheep. Ubuntu is the most friendly version of linux. Even a person who has only used windows, can use ubuntu easily. 
And yes I use all three OSes in a daily basis.
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:17:43
Coinbase paid .06 cents to transfer $200 with litecoin. Crazy why people still use Bitcoin to transfer money.
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:43:32
Nope, the maker doesn't pay shit in gdax, stop misinforming newcomers. loving a coin is so pathetic.
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:00:04
BTC &amp; LTC for Life &lt;3
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:31:13
What I am saying is that unless you mine the blocks and process the transactions will you not make a difference. Imagine that the second chain that will be created BP148 has less than 30% of the current mining power. What will happen to the transactions and what will their fees be? They would multiply by 3x correct? How are you going to explain to non tech savvy people that now there are two bitcoins, and that they need to move to an exchange (which currently no exchange has announced their support) where he or she can buy this segwit Bitcoin. As much as I care and love for Bitcoin I see this UASF being counter productive at this current state. It will harm more than it will help. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:53:32
All OSes are hackeable, just ones are more easier than others. Linux is the hardest, just saying that.
@_date: 2017-06-08 23:25:17
Problem is that it's not a $2 fee it's usually around $7 
@_date: 2017-06-01 03:22:30
You can buy litecoin in coinbase, then transfer it to whatever exchange you want and there buy Bitcoin back or keep the litecoins, makes sense?
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:28:44
we would all be fucked lol
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:33:51
Not really, I'm resting up but, long story short they hacked ethereum-wallet.net, earlier in Reddit someone posted a link to a blockchain where a hacker was trying to crack one code, the 25 coins that went offline yesterday, the guy who cracked a private key by "accident". I am too paranoid and this might be all FUD but too many hacking stuff has been happening lately, too many to be considered a merely coincidence
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:09:14
Do not have electrum in Windows nor Mac. Only in Linux.
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:49:23
Support vertcoin, it's a Bitcoin fork that disables ASCIIs booster or however it's called. Even if you don't plan to use the coin, I bought it because I believe strongly in this philosophy
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:43:05
Research a lot. Bitcoin is about to witness it biggest achievement or it's biggest fail this coming August 1. I would recommend you to buy as much of you can of Bitcoin, Ethereum and litecoin and then just hold them
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:26:50
I agree with you, there will be only one with the majority of the money behind, but I am talking about all the version of bitcoin that will exist. 
I will also move to Bitcoin with Segwit once it happens.
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:36:32
Where did you get those numbers?
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:19:28
I am a firm believer that if bitcoin doesn't activate segwit, its only purpose will be to hold wealth, and litecoin will be the general day to day currency. So I dont recommend you to just dump your coins but diversify them. Anyways good luck to you my good friend, hope to see you at the moon.
@_date: 2017-06-06 23:09:51
Just nevermind man, enjoy your Mac.
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:53:04
Maybe, I don't like it neither but who knows. Buy litecoin and vertcoin then
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:42:28
I have done my own research, and I came to the conclusion that Bitcoin is an awesome coin, but so are litecoin and vertcoins. I did not blind myself thinking that all altcoins are the same and therefore they are all scams, which you indeed did and will be missing amazing opportunities by being stubborn. But maybe you know something I do not, maybe you have inside information that I dont, and thats why you previously stated that litecoin was a scamcoin compared to bitcoin. So since I have money invested in bitcoin and litecoin, I would like to know what you know and decide if I should keep my coins in there or not, so please explain your statement (with facts, not opinions)
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:46:19
Yes, thats the best way
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:34:33
Right but good luck if they already have access to your computer or a keylogger. Linux is just the safest OS to handle your coins. That's all about it
@_date: 2018-12-30 06:11:56
There is a exchange that recently out of the blue decided to delist litecoin and list guess which one..... You got it! Bcash. I'm sure they took the money.
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:54:46
did you try sending it from your private wallet? if so you just need to synchronize it and it should appear in your wallet once again.
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:05:34
Litecoin has been here longer, why not just use it?
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:31:09
Yes sir!
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:15:24
Litecoin does have a block size limit, it is currently at 8mb. I read people say litecoin is safer than bitcoin, i hear people saying that bitcoin is safer (hack wise). At the end they both compliment each other from my perspective. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:57:28
I do agree, it is a shitcoin, but is great to move money around lol. I dont like it, but we have to recognize its positive points too.
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:06:35
I don't know where you live but coinbase work great for me (US), then I transfer mine to other sites like bitfinex or poloniex, these two are both great, then once you buy your coins, download them to a wallet and forget they even exist, come back in a year or two and enjoy your Lamborghini
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:21:22
The best coin so far I have seen for decentralize coins are vertcoins. By removing the Chinese miners, they give mining back to the users.
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:29:55
Bitcoin has become a good parking slot for money, litecoin is becoming the freeway
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:31:58
Do not take my advise? He will pay dollars to transfer, while with litecoin he will pay cents. Please explain your irrational logic.
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:24:50
That's a no brainer statement lol
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:33:08
how does it work then?
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:15:51
It will depend if it can activate segwit successfully or not, otherwise we might see Litecoin being worth over $100
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:20:47
Litecoin transfer fees are just a few cents, meanwhile you know the whole deal with bitcoin. Why use litecoin? because its a better bitcoin? it has segwit, higher capacity, lightning network is coming, rsk is coming, msk is coming, atomic swapping is coming. Now why use bitcoin?. Dont get me wrong, I love bitcoin, but it does not work to transfer wealth at this point. I see Bitcoin being the parking lot and Litecoin being the freeway. They complement each other. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:57:02
Fuck that guy so much
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:16:58
Are they still only accepting bitcoin? I want to give it a try but no with the current fees, I would like to use litecoin if possible. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:12:15
put some money in LTC, that way if Segwit fails in BTC, you will be in the winning side enjoying Segwit, but if it does activate, then you will also be in the winning side enjoying Segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:41:55
Buy the three major coins out there, BTC, LTc and ETH. Then just hold them for years, come back and you will be rich
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:17:02
It is faster because it process blocks every 2.5 mins, while bitcoins does it every 10. Please explain how is that not faster? I want to understand your logic
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:56:32
Why not LTC?

yeah tell that to noobies, now we will have 4 coins, BTC unlimited, BTC classic, BTC core and now BTC segwit. Easy isnt?
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:24:56
Transfer them to litecoin, move them to your desire destiny and then buy BTC back, litecoins fees are almost null, less then 1 cent
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:56:45
Maybe you are right, maybe it is simpler. Who knows.
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:13:16
No, it is to show support at this price so Bitcoin does not crash.
If you want to have an alternative however, this guy made a tutorial on how to convert bitcoins to litecoins, a coin that already has segwit, it is drama-free, gluten-free and tomorrow might get the lightning network activated.
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:53:54
LTC and ETC for sure, but not ETH
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:33:30
lol no, bitcoin is gold, its a way to storage your wealth. For currency i would think ripple more or dash. Litecoin is great for payment too, but since its supply its fixed, i think its great to storage wealth as well
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:00:39
democrats? lol you are bringing politics here when republicans are the snowflakes 
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:05:51
Use litecoin to transfer money out, dont do it through bitcoin. This is how it works, you buy litecoins with your bitcoins, you transfer them out to your exchange paying $0.00, once in your preferred exchange your buy bitcoins back.
Although I suggest you to keep some litecoins, they already have segwit, and with the current dilemma going on, you might want to stay in that side as well.
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:33:11
Buy litecoins, they charge less than a cent to transfer, then after moving them, buy your bitcoins back or keep litecoins, up to you
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:32:21
Not on August 1st, but if it succeeds then yes we should see Bitcoin segwit being worth a couple of thousands more
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:13:26
bitcoin will split into two chains, one that will have segwit activated, the other one will now. So there you go, there will be a version with segwit live on August 1. You just have to make sure that your exchange, or your wallet supports segwit before the transition and your coins will be bitcoin with segwit. Make sure you are on the right side when this come because one coin will die. Also I suggest you to diversity your investment and buy litecoin, it already has segwit, so if bitcoin activates segwit succesfully you win, and if not litecoin already has segwit you will win there as well.
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:39:56
Litecoin Is a cheap way to move coins, but yes sorry for suggesting things you didn't want to hear
@_date: 2017-06-01 02:56:36
Litecoin already has segwit and lightning has not been fully developed. I dont see how they would develop for bitcoin if it doesnt even have segwit in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 04:00:54
Yes I do think so, it has segwit and soon to come the lighting network, rsk, msk and other features that were developed for Bitcoin. Litecoin at this stage is better than Bitcoin but it's way undervalued and it might reach $100 by the end of this year
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:01:41
Yeah man it does suck, I do not support splitting the chain, i rather keep Bitcoin the same and using Litecoin to move money around or Doge. Although dont get me wrong I do support segwit, but not this way.
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:40:44
I still recommend you invest some in litecoin and vertcoin, they will both have RSK which will enable smart contracts. Anyway good luck to you in whichever coin you invest. I will see you at the moon
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:19:07
Another great new about ETH fucking up 
Again, too many coincidences lately.......
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:56:52
You are the cause why this community becomes toxic. You GTFO we don't need your negativity here.
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:52:06
wait 3 days, if it has not been processed, then it will be sent back to your wallet. Next time use Litecoin to send your money, it is cheap.
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:30:39
I love this!, I wonder if regular people can buy a atm to help spread the good stuff
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:36:23
Diversify your portfolio, invest in Litecoin which already has Segwit, so if bitcoin fails to activate it, you are in the winning side, but if bitcoin activates it successfully you are also in the winning side.
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:08:36
this guy made a good video tutorial, check it out
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:03:13
Ah there you go, this is why, lol this is a new generation of bagholders, 2013 was different than now, and you have to agree with me on this. Bitcoin had the same effect, someone tried killing cryptocurrencies. Now a question, if you could travel to the past, and buy bitcoins at $30 each, would you do it? (do not respond this, it is more rhetorical) 
Either way, have a good day man. Hopefully you can join us in telegram, at least for a nice chat. Take care
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:25:32
I am being serious, lets have a real debate here please respond, I want to know how your logic works when you say litecoin is a scam coin compared to bitcoin, please please lets make this happen. Please tell me why and give facts with references. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 13:13:31
So you what you are saying is that if I send bitcoins, they will get there faster than litecoins? because it really does sound like that right now and I want to make sure I am understanding correctly.
@_date: 2017-06-09 01:20:55
How will you garante that? Do you have any kind of special information? Or is it just speculation from your part?
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:48:54
It's a common term to refer to a group of people who own a large amount of a coin and who can manipulate or affect the market
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:14:23
Dont jump ships! just diversity, Bitcoin is very good at keeping value, just place some money in litecoin for transfering. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:30:44
Exactly, I think Litecoin and Bitcoin complement each other and make the overall experience smoother for anyone using them both. Very interesting things are coming this summer! 
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:20:05
With american you mean person from the US? I am not from the USA neither but I am american lol anyways lets not bring USA politics here, we have enough drama
@_date: 2017-06-05 00:22:40
Mac has backdoors. just like a centralized coin is bad, closed software is bad as well
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:42:52
just hold and diversify your portfolio, place at least 70% of your coins in BTC, 25% in LTC and the rest in another cheap but promising coin like Namecoin or Vertcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:13:56
they put big sell orders, which creates less people to buy, and other people might speculate that the prices are falling so they would sell, making the price drop. makes sense?
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:17:50
Hackethereum you meant? lol now I dont think ethereum will surpass bitcoin. But who knows maybe it does maybe it doesnt, only time will tell. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:22:06
I am not saying it's bad, I am saying litecoin is better for transferring coins. But Ripple is even better for that
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:42:04
My most sincere apologies I will delete my post, I just get tired of people​ bashing on Bitcoin so I immediately thought your post was another post of those
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:28:31
Yes, hacking it.
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:47:59
Tell your friend that next time he should sell his bitcoins for litecoins, send them and then buy the bitcoins back
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:17:41
I reposted it. Hopefully it doesnt get deleted
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:58:56
these are good news, we need more companies to come forward announcing which chain they will support
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:20:51
Buy 50% of bitcoin then a 30% of litecoin, then 10% on vertcoin, and the other 10% divided it into monero, ethereum, ethereum classic, dash and ripple. Thats a safe strategy to make big money.
@_date: 2017-06-03 18:23:05
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:39:31
Ok but again why is litecoin a scam compared to bitcoin? by the argument above you did not say why? and it sounds more like you have no idea what Litecoin is.
Litecoin does have a fixed supply, it was not pre-mined (like ETH), the founders do not hold most of the coins (again like ETH and arguably BTC), most of the devs that work on Litecoin come directly from BTC so thank you for all the cheers to them. 
So again my question why is litecoin a scamcoin compared to Bitcoin? From my point of view Litecoin already has segwit, it is faster, it is cheaper to send, lightning network is coming, smart contracts are coming, anonymity is coming, it is as secured as bitcoin because they both come from the same coding. 
Please read litecoin's roadmap for this year: 
After having done that, please come back here and tell me it is a scamcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-04 16:19:54
Also it's centralized and the supply cap is extremely stupid high...
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:19:17
No it doesnt, if most users want bigger blocks, then it is users who decide on it. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:29:56
Oh they are my friend, they are look at the charts, people are accumulating but whales keep the prices low to accumulate more as much as possible. They know Litecoin will explode
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:22:30
So in your logic if you don't like it then it is a scam? Give me a solid argument on why it is a scam otherwise you are not better than a child arguing with an adult 
@_date: 2017-06-09 13:56:19
What? give some of whatever you just smoked please, I wanna get highhhhhhhhhhhhh
@_date: 2017-06-01 02:36:40
did you know you can send litecoin through with zero fees? I love bitcoin but it sucks for transfering money nowadays 
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:36:38
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:49:09
Use Linux to be more safe
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:49:39
Diversify, buy litecoins they already have segwit. If Bitcoin succeeds to activate segwit you will be in the winning side and if not you will also be in the winning side
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:04:54
I did :)
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:21:53
you can buy bitcoins through localbitcoin.net, that is anonymous but you will pay a premium.
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:10:44
Litecoin is already a Bitcoin 2.0, its becoming the safe heave of bitcoin's storms
