Buttcoin is a community synergy strategy. Something similar was employed against Ron Paul, subreddits were created to keep paid shill accounts on the same page as far as strategy and messaging. But the subreddit is also designed to recruit organically.
We'll see how that works out for ya ;)

Whenever I hear "libertarian" used as a pejorative on Reddit, I think the person on the other end must be the spineless, proud owner of a micro-penis.

You mistake trolling for intentional opinion influencing. One is kinda fun, the other is tedious and occurring 24/7/365.

The Squadron is aware of many psychological manipulation and group dynamic techniques, including some you have used from this account in the past. (Some of us used to do what you currently do for a living; takes a fisherman to spot another fisherman.)
As we are decentralized and motivated by a desire for a better world, we will have to decline your sarcastic offer. OTOH, if you are seriously unhappy with your current employment, we can help secure you a job that isn't detrimental to your fellow men and women. Believe me, deceiving others will eat you alive.

I am sure you are aware, but several of the people who visit this subreddit can provide you a substantial amount of money, as well as legal and physical protection, to bring this story to the public.
The narrative bears a similarity to a story told about opinion influencing for the Israeli military, and thus I have concerns about the validity of your claims. However, we don't take chances, and this would be useful if actually real.
The NSA and GCHQ are engaged in opinion influencing of exactly this nature. This was covered by Glenn Greenwald, a journalist formerly at The Guardian.
But lower down the food chain, corporations and special interests use crude versions of the same strategy constantly.
"Social" media is fitting indeed.

When Twitter is blocking a high traffic web site, it is in the public interest to draw attention. And it benefits individual users to resolve this situation.
Attempts to paint us as anything other than a peaceful, 100% law-abiding group of Bitcoin users who are not stupid will backfire.
Enjoy the rest of your weekend mate.
**Edit:** And calling ourselves the "Squadron" is an obvious joke, way to miss that my shilly little fwend. The Ottoman Empire employed eunuchs to train and guard the Sultan's concubines. I see today's anti Bitcoin shills, paid by the banks and some of the less advanced governments (cough, cough Russian Federation), as the modern equivalent of that. How low the shills have made themselves, compared to their fellow men.

ad hominem. The messenger should not matter when the message is self evidently true.

The Squadron thanks you for your vigilance.

The Squadron is decentralized and has no formal leadership structure. Anyone may participate.
This is our first public statement, as at this point we feel it necessary to enlist the public's help. We've been doing our best over the past year, but it has simply gotten out of control. It is disappointing to think of where Bitcoin might be today if it weren't for the hundreds of FUD accounts hammering sites constantly with straw man arguments and intentionally divisive topics, or the disingenuous public personalities such as Mark Williams.

^ The above account has been identified by the Squadron as a likely shill/FUD account.
Comment history is *entirely* negative, appears active only in Bitcoin discussions. Why would a rational actor spend all day online doing this? Is there an economic benefit? Personal benefit? If not, why?
27 days ago: "It's not my fault everyone around here is so poor that they are starting to find Bitcoin uneconomical for transactions."
21 days ago: "So what would you plan to do here without the state?"
And countless other straw man arguments. 
You will lose this battle. ;)
