Sounds like a tough one. QR codes are visual information, so you're asking for something a human can't see, but cameras can. While human vision is pretty good compared to standard phone and laptop cameras, I can think of a couple ideas:
* Use [uv ink](
* Or hide it in the noise [like so](
Good luck!

Haha, yeah. Just trying to show how far you have to reach for reasons.

I can imagine accidentally sending 30 BTC instead of 3 BTC and wanting to retract it, but you're right that it's hard to think of an example like that. Bitcoin addresses contain a checksum that's specifically designed to make it difficult to mistype an address.

I must have missed an announcement. Where did you hear about their plans?

[Be the Match]( is a part of the National Marrow Donation Program and is focused on registering donors (approximately 70% of patients won't have a match within their own family).
It's a great organization and I'd encourage anyone reading this to consider signing up. The website has plenty of information to help determine if it's the right choice for you.
I think the most frequent concern is that the hip surgery for donation is painful, but only 30% of donations are still done that way. The remainder are done using apheresis -- the medical word for being hooked up to a machine that draws, filters, and returns your blood a bunch of times over a few hour period. Having done apheresis a bunch of times (5-10?) for blood platelet donation, I can honestly say the experience is odd but not much worse than donating blood.
Anyway, very inspiring thread @_date: 2015-01-04 15:51:56
Nice catch! Did this happen during the drop or before?
Seems like a handful of long-term speculators might have jumped ship, but it would be interesting to know whether they were just transferred or actually sold on an exchange. Depending on the timing, it's possible that a selloff triggered a large number of bots to short the stock.
Then again, it's hard to resist the panic button when you see your investments dive so quickly.

Is there a better proposal for a consensus block size limit than BU's 'emergent consensus'? I haven't seen anyone propose an alternative method for decentralized agreement-based block size caps (limited to agreement by miners in the case of BU).

Good question, but presumably Core would reject any EC pull request since it's not in their road map/vision of Bitcoin. In that case, providing the branched core+EC repository to let the nodes and miners consider is pretty standard practice.

I don't see how their blockchain is mined. If it's only mined internally, it loses a lot of the typical reasons for using a blockchain. Perhaps there are some custom features of their  blockchain that aren't listed in the article?
Any info on that @_date: 2017-03-22 13:09:57
I've heard this claim a number of times, but haven't seen evidence or a well-argued analysis.
Is there a write-up somewhere that shows decent evidence that the backlogs and high fees are due to a spam attack? 
@_date: 2019-11-21 07:49:18
This seems needlessly simple. 
What if we chop up the IOU derivatives, mash a bunch of randomly selected pieces together, and allow people to invest in the resulting Frankenvestment?
@_date: 2015-08-24 04:34:25
Is that a fair comparison? The *transfer* of bitcoins is what makes these companies potentially profitable, not the value or market cap.
@_date: 2015-08-25 20:42:35
Agreed. OP's interpretation wouldn't make sense for Bitcoin, so there must be an alternative.
My guess is that "most common floor" means "Votes will be rounded down to the nearest MB before being tallied." Maybe it's nearest power of 2 in MB, maybe it's something else. 
Why do it this way? I assume some miners will hand-pick limits they think are good while others would like to compute them. This allows votes to be more specific without getting discarded.

Dude, come on. Posts like this without proof come off as tinfoil hat conspiracy theories. The community can do better.
@_date: 2017-04-03 05:37:02
Yeah, it would be great to see a list of account names and any evidence (timestamps?). Not sure how this could reallybe verified.

This type of post is exactly the problem. Undermine bad ideas and ignore the figureheads, they are a constant distraction in the bitcoin world.

Step 2 - Lightning Networks.
Step 3 - Run profitable LN's or act as a consulting firm. Big banks and payment hubs will want to run their own LN's and Blockstream will be able to provide the software and know-how to anyone who isn't tech-savvy enough to build their own LN (for a fee).

What is emergency trading and why does it have to be done on Kraken? Hard to imagine any scenario where your trade needs to go through ASAP and you couldn't just do it on another exchange.

This is the crux of it, isn't it? If I wanted to read every post by a bitcoin celebrity, I would follow them on Twitter.
I'm here for long-form discussion.

Not sure what you mean. One of the reasons the anti-Bitmain sentiment grew so large was because of AsicBoost itself.
Are you happy that there's competition in the AsicBoost space? Or just the mining space, even though the competitor is also implementing AsicBoost?
Edit: Cool, thanks for the downvotes everyone. I'm just asking for clarification on someone's opinion without taking a stance myself, so I don't understand the hate here.

Both sides are showing how many people answered a Gallup poll question a certain way. The right side shows how many people answered high/very high trust for a progression (green) and the left side shows how many people answered very low/low (red). OP added a claim about income level, but that isn't in either chart at all.
Here is the original chart from Gallup:

The nature of bitcoin puts financial security of users into their own hands, so I think vulnerability coverage does have a place in this community. It just seems like weekly digests are more appropriate for than many individual posts.
