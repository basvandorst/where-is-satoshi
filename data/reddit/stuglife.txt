I'm on my mobi so I can't dig out the link but there have been multiple cases of people being paid in btc, just saying

That wouldn't be the problem for me, but.. sinking 20+ bucks into something without the chance of trying it? Meh.

German here: Actually I wouldn't. It's much harder to keep track of your expenses and save money for bigger things if it becomes a steady flow in your account.
I prefer getting a ton of money at the beginning of a month and be able to plan on spending it.

Why does your store show USD prices when you're Bitcoin only?
How about displaying btc and then USD as a side note? I have to convert to Euros anyway ;)

As you already covered cellphone infrastructure depends on the target area but I heard it's pretty good, even in most developing countries. Cryptocurrencies would require a smartphone of some kind (the stuff thrown away nowadays is just fine) or a trusted exchange which can be used via short message. (Not too bad)
The main question for me would be: is there any established solution which you would be going against?

Nice concise writeup so far but riddle me this, Batman: what would take Apple so long to create their own currency? Premining? I didn't try to but it feels like minting a new altcoin can be done via web-form judging from their numbers..

Germany once made a test run for hyper-inflation. Shortly thereafter they voted for Hitler. You don't want hyper-inflation.

I rarely hear the word Euros though.. but yes, I spent lots of time changing the plurals in an essay

Which background does your presentation have? What are your goals?
You'd bore a non-technical audience to death trying to explain the technology behind Bitcoin. 
How about pointing out advantages and limitations without going into too much detail in any part and debunk common myths on the way?

I appreciate the move but it should say US-students. The rest of the world doesn't get those fancy .edu-addresses :(

Please explain to me how "money loses buying power per unit and is therefore worth less" helps those who have more of it.
Hyperinflation hits those who rely on money, those people become poor. If you're a farmer producing goods, own a house or art you'll become rich. Happened in Germany between the wars.


Oh don't listen to me I'm an evil socialist European!
@_date: 2014-07-17 06:36:38
True but do the math:
1,000,000 : 50 = 20,000
Each week 200 blocks are mined (rough estimate via difficulty adaption) which would result in 100 weeks or about two years of mining alone.
I haven't looked at the blockchain, but that sounds wrong to me.
Also excuse any errors in the calculation, I'm just having breakfast.

I think 130 Years of tradition will let the name stick. Together with myths from glorious times
@_date: 2014-07-07 07:34:02
Interesting indeed but the headline is finest linkbait.
They didn't attempt it they just calculated cost and roi. Also they learned a lot about Bitcoin and lost nothing. No mistake.
@_date: 2014-08-26 06:25:42
Side note: more blocks per hour also creates a bigger blockchain since you add more headers to the same number of transactions.
This may not be much for a single block but it adds up rapidly

What exactly do you want to know? History? Technology? How to use and how not?
@_date: 2014-06-03 07:26:53
It's called wishful thinking.
Also to add to the topic: I think it was some sort of PR stunt. Just see the sheer number of posts here..
@_date: 2014-09-04 22:49:57
Sounds like a manageable problem since AC-adapters are not too hard to get. 
I pulled some strings at my university and maybe I can get the project some use there.
So~ inevitable question: what's the price tag? (preferably including shipping to Germany)
@_date: 2014-07-03 14:50:15
While I can't answer your question from a monetary perspective it sure is a nice way to get some coin, encourage the seller to keep those in stock and stay anonymous
@_date: 2014-07-12 15:47:47
It would really help if you included the country (state?) you want to set it up in.
I'm of no further help but just saying

Well ask your common sense: If Thorium is so awesome and the idea of a Thorium car is really old, why has nobody built a Thorium reactor yet?

Why is the Norwegian flag on Iceland?
Edit: there is a pointer to Norway, I just didn't see it on the small screen. The rest still stands tough.
Also the text matches Iceland, which has some foreign currency ban in their legislation since the banking crisis happened.
I don't blame the creator since I may fail as well when working with the US States but that should be fixed.
@_date: 2014-05-27 08:28:52


Depending on the definition of rich. Just accept gold and art instead of worthless paper  (Implying art is not worthless paper) and you have more than the others.


Fun fact: what we do in Europe is far from socialism, but it fits the popular use of the word. It was supposed not to be taken literally here. No offense.


I don't believe that, I just hope it slows it down...

Well if you look at places like Silkroad then there has been a great use of Bitcoin in the early times. I guess any kind of online criminals need a way to exchange funds anonymously: before Bitcoin there was Liberty Reserve and some Euro-themed currency, so Bitcoin is not as disruptive as you hope in that field, it's more like going from Yen to Baht for those people.
Pro tip: do some serious research on those anonymous currencies (eGold was big, too) and their shutdowns, also cracker forums will list the accepted currencies for wares/z.
It's older than you think.
Also there is some ancient system based purely on trust but I forgot the name. Something Arabic sounding..
@_date: 2014-06-04 05:31:49


I made about 6 cents in two days, so I guess that would be a No. 


Solo mining won't get you anywhere. Joining a mining pool without specialized hardware will also result in very low gains (I made more money from the faucets). Also your bill will rise since your hardware won't go into any power saving modes and work full blast instead.


This depends on your needs


Tons of 'em. I used to use Bitcoin.clarkmoody.com but I'm not sure if it's still working. Also the address is written from the top of my head, so it may not work (moodys may be correct)
