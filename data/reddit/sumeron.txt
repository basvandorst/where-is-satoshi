It's actually the mods of this subreddit who have decided to set the default sorting to 'controversial'. You can fix it by clicking 'controversial' and setting it to 'best' on the top of the page after 'Sort comments by:'

Thanks for this, I've been searching ways for getting involved in TOR and combined with a possible BTC reward is even better. Set it up on my tablet that's idle anyway, and went ahead and set up an old Raspberry pi that was just sitting there, all running at 2.5MB/s (MegaBytes, not bits). I feel useful now.

Not a newbie but I'd like to know something about re-using addresses:
I've been told that it is bad practice to re-use an address of which I own the private key. I know the private key isn't broadcast to the network (that's in the protocol) but still it is discouraged. 
**What is the reason that it is discouraged to re-use the same public address?** 
The way I gather it is only about the privacy factor. Say I don't mind people knowing that a certain address is used by me, is it still discouraged to re-use the same public address over and over? 
(I use a TREZOR, so I don't re-use addresses, I'm just curious).

Fair enough. The video creator also gave me a valid explanation and I stand corrected. I just thought it something to point out and I see the difference now. Governments can just make money willy nilly (which doesn't mean they should) and Bitcoin is irreversible, it's software determined. Thanks for clarifying :)

You earn another node in the network for a month, which in turn helps to speed up the network and thus helping to secure the functionality of Bitcoin. Unless I misread something about nodes.

Of course, since the transaction is validated by now with 2 confirmations I feel confident enough, the answer was the slogan of Kryptokit.

Isn't Bitcoin also generated "out of thin air" until the block rewards cease to be? I like Bitcoin and I use it as well, but in your step 2 this seems contradictory.

I'd run  one of these for the sake of contributing to the network.

Ooh I found one, and I didn't expect to find one. That's a very clever way of advertising, I really like this!

Oh so behind the scenes, Electrum uses the Private key to sign the message, while all is needed to verify is the public key?
@_date: 2014-09-23 15:36:51
I felt like this too, until I found one that hasn't been found. If you found a valid phrase that has already been used, it still tells you that you found an invalid result. If only they said 'already found', that would make it much more user friendly.

I think that's (maybe unintentionally) the point here: It's not obvious how it works, and the only party getting better of this are the banks.
 I'm not a bank hater myself, mind, but I do see the advantages of Bitcoin in comparison to the current system.
If I were to send a transaction of say €1000 to a non-european country, that would cost me €3,50 transaction fee. In Bitcoin this would (with current exchange rates) cost me €0,03.  The processing time in fiat would be one or two days, unless it's a weekend. In Bitcoin it would be around 10 minutes, maybe 30 before it can be spent. Clearly you can see why people like it. I sure do.
@_date: 2014-10-22 16:54:47
I sometimes have to send money internationally. With banks it would take a lot of time, not to mention fees. Paypal also uses fees. Bitcoin also uses fees. Bitcoin however has the lowest fees of them all and is instant above all. That's why I support Bitcoin. The fact that more stores start accepting it also helps greatly because I don't have to convert to fiat first to spend money. It's great :)

I used to have my hot wallet on Windows in Electrum, and I printed out paper storage with a Ubuntu machine. Now that I have a Trezor, it's just the Windows machine. (Ubuntu machine's HDD died as well)

I wholeheartedly agree with this. The whole idea of Bitcoin is peer-to-peer, not peer-to-company-to-peer. What we need is a more convenient way of paying rather than manually typing in 15-character addresses (which have a margin for error). Like the Bitcoin app, which can use QR codes or even bluetooth.
@_date: 2014-10-27 16:04:04
I see, so no only a privacy issue, but in the case a vulnerability is found, the funds associated are at risk as well. Glad I followed that advice blindly and never re-used the addresses. Thanks for the explanation!
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:44:06
I'm familiar with Bitcoin, and I hold some myself, but I have a specific question about the sign/verify dialog in the Electrum wallet.
The way I understand it is that you input a message, and a key and out comes a signed (encrypted) message. What I don't understand is what it is for: Since anyone can access your public keys, couldn't anyone input a message to pretend they have your public keys? Or am I missing something on this functionality?

A shame you only ship in the US, I would really like some Drosera binata seeds. I'm going to keep track of your site should you ever manage to ship outside of the US :)

I got mine 3 days ago, it's well worth the purchase. I would love to have some added functionality to the web-wallet though, or I will use it with Electrum when 2.0 hits.

If your goal is to advertise, might as well link to the OFFICIAL trezor website to be safe: 
@_date: 2014-09-13 13:18:37
Ok thanks for the explanation! I knew how to sign transactions but I was oblivious that it used the private keys associated with the public keys, it makes sense now since private keys are very long. Thanks! I don't have changetip but there's something on this address for you, since you were kind enough to verify ownership :)

I don't have a CC (not the culture in my country) so I'll be participating I guess. But then again, I haven't had a CC in like 22 years.

There is, for TREZOR's. I know the TREZOR is for Bitcoin storage so you would have to be in the world to even want to use one, but it is a valid example of a merchant that sells something exclusively for Bitcoin. (No advertising, I'm just trying to respond to your statement)

If you have ING (ergo IDeal) you can use [ . I've used them multiple times and you can simply buy a few bits with no registration required (registration form on the site is for business owners). I'm sure they're not the cheapest around, but they're legit and hassle-free.
@_date: 2015-05-13 20:04:14
Oh in that case I'm sorry, I read ING and just assumed you had the Dutch bank. Please disregard my post.

Looking at the backlog of a few days back, I personally have seen the mempool get as full as over 8mb (This might have been higher). Still, if the maximum block size was 5mb like you say here, 5x more transactions could be taken into a block. Instead of 1mb approximately every 10 minutes, we now have 5mb approximately every 10 minutes. I personally don't see why there's so much fuss about this whole blocksize increase. Just increase it and get it over with, if someone wants to make a lot of transactions, they're going to do that anyway, might as well have the 'legitimate' users suffer as little as possible by quickly clearing backlogs. 
Besides, it's a maximum, not a minimum size. It's not like the nodes will clog with only 8mb blocks as soon as the increase happens, it just allows for bigger blocks.
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:57:39
Funny to read this, as on [bitcoin.org]( they advertise with: "Zero or low processing fees".
I understand that a few satoshi's more won't do much damage to the average person, but if the 1MB limit remains, the fees will eventually get higher and higher. Might as well go to a bank to have your transaction processed.
For now the miners are rewarded by the coinbase and fees, that should be enough for the time being, bigger blocks also mean more transaction fees to colllect.
On [Tradeblock]( there's currently 1.8337 BTC in fees waiting to be collected, the 1MB limit doesn't allow miners to grab all those fees, instead it arbitrarily limits them to do less with their time. If you could create bigger blocks, it frees up the mempool (and takes stress off of nodes) and allows transactions to go through. Spam or not, all transactions should be treated equally, that's my thought for Bitcoin. Transactions will eventually end up on the blockchain anyway, might as well do it quicker and not have the rest of the userbase 'suffer' for it, right?
@_date: 2015-07-12 11:20:24
Isn't the whole point of Bitcoin that all transactions are treated equally? No prioritizing, no "censoring" based on whether a transaction is considered "spam" or not, no paying higher fees if you want to have your transaction hurried up. I keep reading in topics that people just have to up their fee if they want a transaction approved earlier. Well guess what? With the current speed a bank would be faster, the very thing that Bitcoin was designed to bypass/make obsolete. Yesterday I forgot there was a full mempool and I sent a transaction. Took about 6 hours after broadcast to finally be taken into a block. 
I know there's this thing going on, but what about the general public? What if someone has a transaction that needs to be paid within 10 minutes? The network shouldn't care about whether something is spam, and that's why I say that the block capacity should be increased. If someone wants to spam the network they're going to do that anyway, but with bigger blocks the backlog will be smaller (and cleared away faster) which will allow legitimate transactions to pass through earlier. Knowing this sub I'll probably get downvoted but I felt this needed saying.

Sent you a PM, interesting idea, looking forward to see the results. Can't have enough publicity.
@_date: 2015-10-11 12:23:34
Thanks, I'm going to look into that. Maybe I can hook up an old unused 500gb HDD to the Raspberry to load the blockchain on, that should keep me alright for a good time.
@_date: 2015-10-11 02:09:52
I agree, Electrum works excellent with the Trezor. I'd love to run a full node and use the Trezor with it, if anyone knows how to do that it would be even better. (I have access to a Raspberry Pi, though I've read it is discouraged to use one of those to set up a full node)
