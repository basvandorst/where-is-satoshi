 - give money directly to the extremely poor, which has been proven to be more effective than giving to more bureaucratic charities.

Is there anyone working on these things at the moment?

It’s shame the core crew seem to dismiss blocksize increase simply because of the bcash drama.

Half the stories on r/Bitcoin :
“It’s someone else’s fault!”

In the last month, bcash has gone down 30% while bitcoin has gone up 300%. No wonder he’s angry.

It doesn’t really work because you have to hold the money.
If you had enough so you could ‘harvest’ dollars from it every month without its value decreasing, then it would make sense. How many bitcoin would you need for that?
So for $60k a year, that’s 5k a month. I don’t know the math, but maybe in 2020 it would work.

Ok, thanks. So there could be a till at the coffee shop which presents a customer-facing barcode, I scan using an app, confirm with my thumb (or face) and the money is exchanged immediately? What about fees? I don’t pay any with Apple Pay. I don’t know if the coffee shop absorbs that. 
And do the other nodes on the network know about my purchase?

Increase the block size. Even if it’s a ‘temporary fix’, it a tow truck which gets the broken down car to the garage.

Using Apple Pay I can just use my thumbprint to pay for my coffee, in a couple of seconds, securely. Will bitcoin ever be that simple?  Lightning Network seems extremely complicated, and to believe it will replace money requires an enormous amount of delusion. Can someone tell me what the simplest possible payment experience would be, after LN has been in place for a year or two?

Litecoin will also overtake bcash market cap soon.

Wait till your investment is doubled, then cash out half. Then, whatever happens, you won’t have lost money.
HODL till DUBL then HALF

If a poor pregnant woman takes 9 months to create a child, does it take 3 rich pregnant women 3 months?

Isn’t there value in being a bank?
I mean, I don’t want to look after thousands of dollars in cash in my house. And I want to be able to use my money to buy things instantly with very low fees. I’m not getting that with bitcoin because the devs are so stubborn.

Bitcoin people seem to blame everyone except themselves.

I have 1 btc in Bitcoin Core, which I’ve used since 2013 (when I think it was called Bitcoin-qt).
What do I need to do to access the 1 segwit2x coin after the split? Is it not possible using Bitcoin Core? Do I have to move my coin to a service which will support both blockchains (coinbase..?)

There has been talk of ASIC-resistant altcoins - like Bitcoin Gold. I’m sure it’s mostly hype, but it has the promise of democratising and decentralising. Is this something BTC would ever move into? It seems to make sense to mine coins on the same kind of computers that have standard wallets - desktops, laptops, tablets, phones.

When does it reach 1 million according to this? 2027?
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:29:03
That’s an official source?

I think this chart from 2014 is coming true:
i.e $10k at the end of 2017. Except that since the BCH fork, the value should be calculated with 1 BTC + 1 BCH. The proportionate  value between these currencies might change, but adding them is the best way to think about it. 
1 BTC + 1 BCH now is approx 1250 + 6250 = $7500.

Is there an objective source for bitcoin news, who can collate all the relevant info and make it understandable?
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:00:47
Visa has 24 thousand transactions per second. BTC can handle around 4. Not 4 thousand, just 4. New kid BCH can do over 30. Even 30 is very far from 24 THOUSAND.
None of the solutions seem to approach Visa’s transactions-per-second.
