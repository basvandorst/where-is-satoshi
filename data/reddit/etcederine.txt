Its "very likely"? Come on man, there is no evidence and its all FUD.  This is why I dislike Monero, and their devs are jerks too.  I did plenty of research on it, and I bought Monero today and the price is way up, so I am not biased in my opinion.

That is the sad thing.  Its the monero devs themselves propagating the lie.  I see absolutely no evidence there in that link that bytecoin was unfairly launched.  Bytecoin and cryptonote white paper were really excellent contributions to the crypto space.  This guy helps rip them off then gets his coin popular by FUDing the competition.  They do it against DASH, shadowcash, and other anonymous coins too.  Its a load of bull.  I was around when bytecoin launched.  It was well known, but they did not have a marketing team like XMR to pump the price.  It just stood on the technical merits.  You could see bytecoin listed on clearnet sites like dustcoin, which was the precursor to coinmarketcap.  Yet they want to claim, it "only existed on the darknet", so then its an unfair launch, give me a break.

Monero is just a ripoff of bytecoin.  We need really true privacy on top of Bitcoin, and not empower these scammer ripoff artist developers like XMR, ETH, and DASH.

Monero is just a scam ripoff of bytecoin, and their devs are bunch of dickheads who lie and say bytecoin was premined.  They just want to pump their coin price so they get rich and nothing else.  They will post a link to a bitcointalk thread by some obvious Monero shill who says bytecoin is premined, and offer that as their proof.  Anybody who researches or has been in the space for years knows bytecoin was around for a long time on the darknet.  They are mad since they never knew about it they call it a premine. Bytecoin was one of the earliest coins. By that logic Bitcoin is also premined by Satoshi.  Don't believe these scammers.
