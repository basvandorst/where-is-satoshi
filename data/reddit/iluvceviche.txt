How can my friend check whether she downloaded the legitimate version of breadwallet?  She downloaded and started using it a few days ago.

Was Bitfinex not insured and therefore the customers' money protected like Coinbase is supposed to be?
@_date: 2016-08-01 15:44:13
Agreed.  This is the video that did it for me.  I think it's much better.  
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:06:56
Why does such a popular exchange like Bitfinex not have insurance?  Why did their customers use them without insurance after Mt.Gox???  Even Coinbase is insured.  Am I missing something here?  
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:15:59
Is Bitfinex not insured like Coinbase/banks are?
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:56:16
yep.  
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:48:38
Agreed, and if you have more than a few bitcoins, get a hardware like  Trezor or Ledger Nano S.
@_date: 2016-08-14 02:14:26
Can you explain what this means?  Even when I look up the definition of fungibility I still don't understand it.
@_date: 2016-04-06 18:48:43
Wait, you mean you can't just send all your BTC from Coinbase to Trezor?  What's Tumbler?  
@_date: 2016-04-03 04:04:27
Okay, please set me straight if I've got this all wrong.  I've watched the entire video and either AA is missing the point or I am.  Scaling of internet is fundamentally different than the problem of scaling bitcoin and so it's not a good example of why bitcoin will scale.  Interent scaling was a matter of bandwidth.  Bitcoin, on the other hand, isn't a matter of bandwidth - that already exists if we want it - but rather a matter of a debate of scaling at the cost of losing decentralization.  So, it's a problem of choice, not of limitation.  Am I missing something here?
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:04:02
Are segwit TXs cheaper? How much are they? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:29:29
Thanks for replying.  Can you elaborate what you mean by achieving greatness?  If and when the developers achieve what they are working on, what will BTC be like?
@_date: 2015-12-19 06:13:12
Non-technical here.  So, what are we supposed to encrypt exactly?  And how is it done?
@_date: 2015-12-03 05:18:20
I guess something like that is only available if you hold your own wallet?  Cause that wasn't available when I sent/received on Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-12-15 00:21:01
Do you mean that you mined a whole bitcoin?  How do you do that?
@_date: 2015-12-15 00:58:44
Where do you buy/sell bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-12-14 07:23:10
Can someone please ELI5?
@_date: 2015-12-14 21:34:34
Does Quadrigacx work differently to Coinbase?  It says "We buy bitcoins at $581.44CAD
We sell bitcoins at $642.64CAD"  ???!!?!  Why such a big discrepancy???  Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:25:01
Unfortunately, I'm not a coder/programmer/developer so I'm not capable of comprehending what's there.  That's also why I don't know what's happening.  I wish I could code and help out.
@_date: 2015-12-19 15:15:30
What do you recommend instead? 
@_date: 2015-12-03 06:27:52
You mean the 1%?  Not so small in my opinion.  But I was talking about sending and receiving BTC.
@_date: 2015-12-03 05:07:51
What's a miner fee?  Pardon me if it's such a basic question.  I'm using Coinbase and it didn't cost me anything to send/receive BTC.
@_date: 2015-12-14 21:13:43
Can I ask why the volume is a factor?  Is it more than just an indication of their popularity?
@_date: 2017-02-17 01:56:36
That's a price chart with a rainbow laid on top of it.  The rainbow trajectory doesn't even match up with the price line.  C'mon.  I love charts and graphs but this is not helpful.

Can you explain to me how the dip and rise is predicted?
@_date: 2017-02-19 07:56:50
"I don't pay any fees."  And to be fair, there are fees in bitcoin, too.  How do you argue that?
@_date: 2017-02-19 08:03:28
I agree with your point.  But it's difficult to convince someone with that logic because it's not explicit or clearly visible.
@_date: 2017-02-05 05:15:07
What's your reasoning for believing it will be bullish?
@_date: 2017-02-19 02:25:42
Sorry, I wrote too quickly and wasn't clear with my question.  I have a HW wallet.  But I don't know my private key - I don't think anyone with a HW does.  So how does one store they private key on a cryptosteele?  That's what I was asking.  As for seeds, others have said that you can save up to 24 words.
@_date: 2017-02-04 19:55:12
Thumbs up! ;)
@_date: 2017-02-22 13:59:17
So you can't recover your wallet even with your 24 word seed if you forget your passphrase?!  That's scary.
So, what is a passphrase like?  Is it a sentence?  or word?  And what do you mean by a "different" wallet?
@_date: 2017-02-27 15:39:49
Looks like copper.  Doesn't copper corrode in wet conditions?
@_date: 2017-02-15 04:10:21
Are we expecting some bad news from China?  Which news is that?  Another redditor posted this graph predicting a dip -   What's happening?

Thanks, @_date: 2017-02-05 01:04:44
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:15:47
Thanks for the explanation.  Just a quick question about the limitations of the passphrase.  Does it count for capital/non-capital letters?  Can it include numbers and symbols like @  For example, "It's 9:15 am in the morning!"?
@_date: 2017-02-28 13:39:28
I don't understand how you mean by "bump" or I'm not too familiar with that term.  Do you mean to say the market will keep rising until 2019/2020?  
@_date: 2017-02-22 13:49:15
What's this passphrase thing?  My trezor said not to install it unless you really know what you're doing. I understand the PIN and recovery seeds, but not the passphrase.  how does it work?
@_date: 2016-03-29 18:10:21
But what if I'm at a shop wanting to make a purchase and only have my phone with me?  How can I buy something with multisig in such a case?
@_date: 2017-02-12 19:46:34
How does one put things on the blockchain?  I keep hearing about this on this forum but I don't see this option anywhere when I send/receive bitcoin.  FYI, I use Mycelium and Trezor. 
@_date: 2017-02-19 07:55:11
So, for a millennial who doesn't care about privacy, it doesn't seem to have a bad side.  And they say that they don't have anything to hide from the government because they aren't doing anything illegal.  How would you argue that?

War will most likely be with one of the Muslim countries he banned, don't you think?  Don't think he'll go to war with China.  Nothing much to gain there (no oil).

We keep hearing about this but my friends in Japan all say they don't know anyone who uses it and that nobody knows what it is. Why the discrepancy? Is it like how people say Amazon accepts bitcoin but they actually don't and only is facilitated via a third party?

LOL!!!!  I really hope people get this.  
@_date: 2017-02-20 13:26:25
If miners must compete to solve mathematical puzzles to create the block does that mean the fastest computer will always win?  Meaning that one can set up a mining operation and never earn a bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-03-30 16:19:08
Might be a stupid question, but how do you encrypt something on your own?  Is it just a matter of compressing it with a password?  Or is there a software that encrypts anything for you?
@_date: 2016-03-30 18:41:42
If you have to exchange twice (1 HKD&gt;BTC, 2 BTC&gt;GBP), the BTC exchange fee might be as costly as the bank's exchange rate and fee for HKD&gt;GBP.  It depends on 1 the amount and 2 the fees of the BTC exchanges and bank.  
Bitcoin's true value comes into play when you make, keep and spend it in bitcoin.  Otherwise, you're partially losing out to the bank or other exchanges' rates and fees.
You should be able to calculate which works out better for you before you proceed.  Call the bank and ask what their rates/fees are.

Can you elaborate on this?  You mean if the seed recovery word is "computer", only "comp" is used and sufficient?
@_date: 2016-03-29 17:37:07
And which wallets allow you to do Multisig?  I thought most wallets, like Mycelium, are either desktop or mobile, but usually not both.
Also, I just a mac for a laptop but an android for mobile.  Will that work, too?
Finally, what if I'm at a coffee shop and want to make a payment with my phone?  
@_date: 2017-02-28 03:49:17
You're right.  I wasn't implying that Bitcoin is correlated with the US economy, though.  Just suggesting that it is a safe hedge against the North American market falling into a recession.
@_date: 2017-02-05 05:39:45
It doesn't mean we don't care about war.  But point taken.
@_date: 2016-03-29 18:29:40
What if I drop and lose my phone.  Is there a way to recover?
@_date: 2016-03-29 15:59:53

Ah... I see.  They're not trying to invent new currencies.  They're applying blockchain's technology to the existing fiat but just allowing instantaneous transfers instead of the normal 3 days transactions that's required like right now.  Is that right?  Yeah, that's not addressing the issues bitcoin is trying to solve at all.

I do the same thing.  But do you think it'll drop below what it is now?  Nevermind.  It's bitcoin.  Anything is possible.
@_date: 2017-01-30 16:08:35
Umm... was hoping this prediction would come true, making it $1M by 2026...  
@_date: 2016-06-16 16:02:04
That's, smart.  Well, depending on when you got in.  But in the run long, smart.
@_date: 2016-06-16 22:14:20
That's smart.  Do you set it to buy automatically?  (Using Coinbase, I'm assuming?)  
@_date: 2017-01-30 17:05:18
Exactly!  Even Early 2016, after the Hearn dip, it was pretty steady for a few months before it shot up again.
@_date: 2017-01-26 22:31:09
Bitcoin won't play as big a role as expected before.  Bitcoin was the answer when Trump threatened to confiscate a percentage of wires going to Mexico, but that doesn't seem to be his plan any longer.   He'll now charge Mexican imports a 20% tax, instead.  So, less effect on bitcoin, unfortunately.  (I mean, besides the whole wall thing being unfortunate.)
@_date: 2017-01-30 03:49:01
I no work. :(
@_date: 2017-01-28 02:44:41
I have the same mindset.  The only thing to worry about is other cryptocurrencies.  As with everything else, in time, something even better than Bitcoin will come along.
@_date: 2017-01-08 21:50:18


What's that?

"in time..."
@_date: 2017-01-24 03:58:33
So, they each valuable sea shell came with a certificate?  Sounds like the real value was in the certificate, then.  Interesting.  Where did you get this information?  I'd like to read into it further.

The rates predicted here are significantly less than what's predicted here:    Which is more accurate, you think?
@_date: 2017-01-30 15:08:52
I agree.
@_date: 2017-01-19 13:48:55
But it's not exactly 1M club because bitcoin isn't evenly distributed, right?  I mean there are a lot less than 1 M people who have 21 or more bitcoins because some people have a lot more, no?  Is there a chart where we can see how many wallets have more than a certain amount?
@_date: 2016-06-19 18:59:05
So, maybe intranet failing is an inaccurate way of saying it.  They serve a different purpose now.  No one outside of that specific organization uses it, does it?  But money has to be used by people outside of the bank.  So, on that sense, an intranet won't serve well and fail.

So, this decrease in hashrate means bitcoin is more decentralized, right?  Does all the hashrate around the world add up to 100%?  This one miner had more than 30% of all the mining power?! 
@_date: 2016-12-29 04:26:45
That's kind of besides the point.  You can gain more bitcoins by selling at $15K and buying back a larger quantity of bitcoins at a lower price (if you believe that will happen) and you'd end up with bitcoins just as well.  This issue is really about maximizing the amount of bitcoin one has.  Not about converting to fiat.
@_date: 2016-12-03 16:56:12
I'm left somewhat confused.  So, then, what is the solution?  How do you "leave it"?

How do they do that exactly?  I hear about people writing messages in the bitcoin transfer but I don't see that capability in Mycelium when I send bitcoins.  If such a thing exists for others who use other wallets somehow, is it a matter of writing something within that message space?  Wouldn't that be very limiting?  And how would they retrieve it?  How would all these new applications such as voting, lease agreements and other things people talk about work?

@_date: 2016-02-22 03:28:31
Circle's fee is included, which is why their rate is higher.  All accounted, Coinbase still offers a better rate even with their 1% fee.  As for the $100 a day limit... I don't know about that.  I don't have such a limit.  I started with both Circle and Coinbase but migrated all to Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-04-02 17:15:35
I'm not sure how accurate these estimates can get because we don't know how many number of wallets belong to an individual.  Pretty sure most of us have more than 1 wallet.

I saw the video of the little Canadian girl explain how fiat money is created from debt, but it didn't completely make sense to me.  She said that the Bank of Canada borrows money from the big banks who lend them money they don't have.  How does this work? If this is true, surely Bank of Canada knows this so why don't they just create money out of thin air the way that the big banks do?  Can you explain what "fiat money is created from debt" means?

@_date: 2016-07-23 01:45:59

There's so much debate over who actually controls the Federal Reserve:  is it a private corporation?  Or is it operated by the government.  People say contrary things.  Videos like this one says a private corporation and they use the white pages as evidence - a rather weak one, while Wikipedia says "Thus, the Federal Reserve System has both private and public components to serve the interests of the public and private banks."  
How can there be so much confusion over who actually runs the god damn thing?  What does that say about the institution?
@_date: 2016-07-06 13:55:23
Yeah, I guess, that's true.  But the bank does tell me that I can't withdraw my more than 10% of my money at once.  Does this still make it $190?  It's becoming abstract at this point.  I mean, even if bitcoin even becomes a universal currency, banks/loan shops would still work this way, wouldn't it?
@_date: 2016-07-07 03:16:40
Or $0 or $1000000.
@_date: 2016-07-04 16:42:28
Kraken's fee structure is DIFFERENT, not better or cheaper.  It can be more or less, depending on the way you take advantage of it.  They do charge 1% for deposits, but with a $50 maximum on a $10K deposit, which then equals to 0.5%.  Then they add a fee for trading.  And on top of that, you are buying at a limited rate so that can be significantly higher or lower than the market rate.  So, Kraken can end up being more costly or less.  I use both Kraken and Coinbase depending on which rate works out best for the time being.  
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:00:29

I guess new lending systems will arise.  Banks don't just store money and there will always be people who need to borrow money for whatever reason.  You're right that we won't be storing our bitcoin with banks.  Perhaps we will all become lenders through a 3rd party app?

Yes, but how is it that the big banks from which they borrow can lend imaginary money they don't have?  (which is what they do, at least according to that video?)  They obviously can't print money.  So where does it come from and how can they get away with it?
@_date: 2016-07-28 15:31:25
The question comes before "why not the people...?".  That question makes debatable presumptions like that the government doesn't represent the people and that it is NOT run by the people - I'm not saying it isn't or that it is.  Many say FR is a public agency.   Can you tell me who runs it first?  And then we'll start judging whether it's right or not.
@_date: 2016-07-18 22:34:53
How do you even determine gain?  Let's say I bought $10 worth of bitcoin everyday for the past year.  Today I sell 0.03 BTC or $20 USD.  Which buy do you compare it against?  It is a gain comparing to the first $20 that I bought, but a loss compared to the $20 that I bough a month ago when it was at a higher rate.  
This applies to stocks as well, not just bitcoin.  I've always wondered.
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:00:36

I think by today's laws, no, it's not a capital gain.  Think of it this way, you buy a Picasso painting for $1000 and then it appreciates to $1,000,000.  You then find a person who wants to trade you their Lambo for your Picasso.  Nothing to report.  This is because the current taxation laws haven't figured out how to categorize bitcoin or how to control it.  Laws will probably change at some point to attempt to address bitcoin.  How effective will it be?  That's another question all together.

I have a question about banks lending out money.  I understand that they use our money for loans and that they hold only about 10% of the money in the system/bank on any given day.  What I want to understand is what is actually meant but "creating money".  Say, for example, a bank's entire deposit from all its customers amounts to $100.  Then they lend up to $90 for loans to group A and have only $10 on reserve.  Okay, fine.  That's not creating money, right?  That's smart business.   Or, are you saying banks will lend $90 to group A AND another $90 to group B?  Which then is just wrong and means they are creating money.  Thanks for the clarification.
@_date: 2016-07-25 04:20:13
