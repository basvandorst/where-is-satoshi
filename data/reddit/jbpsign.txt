Ain't that the truth.  I set aside a small portion to day trade and now own less than half of the original BTC.  I give up.
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:52:11
Good point.

If we did this Coinbase would probably stop paying the fee and pass it onto us.
@_date: 2019-07-19 01:07:04
Well that was dumb.  Should have used Western Union.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:20:13
Could they charge for running full nodes or mining?  That could impact Bitcoin.

Bought mine from them in July...finally got it in October.  They had a huge backlog back then and clearly stated it would take awhile.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:52:07
My opinion is that it siphons money away from BTC.  True, it ligitimizes bitcoin as an over-the-counter investment...but every dollar that goes into futures is a dollar that isn't going into BTC itself.

Truly one of the best books I've ever read.  It's really eye opening if you're into anthropology.
@_date: 2018-06-26 20:37:20
Agreed, another great book.  On that same vein "The Singularity is Near" by Ray Kurzweil is good too.
@_date: 2019-10-16 15:58:28
Sheesh why this person do this?  It's like putting your big cash bank balance on display.

Yeah don't day trade.  Tried it.  Sucks.  If you do, do it with teeny tiny fractions for fun.

All human 'rights' are imagined beliefs most of us happen to share.  Safety is a human 'right'.  So we collect taxes to assure it to the extent possible.  These are spent on roads, military, healthcare, education, etc.  If you don't share these beliefs then don't pay taxes.  Your children will eat the food others pay to make safe, drive the roads others pay to maintain, and freeload off the many other imagined beliefs you claim to share but don't choose to support.
"Untaxed bitcoin is a human right" is akin to saying none of us share common beliefs.  I just don't think this is well thought through.

This isn't quite that straightforward but it's close.  Get a cash advance on your CC.  Then buy BTC from a  BTC ATM using cash.
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:23:36
Couldn't imagine this sub agreeing with any other alternative.  What else could be bitcoin but bitcoin?

I wonder how many 'lost' coins are out there.  Like 5%?  I guess we'll never truly know.
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:58:42
True anyone on this sub is in the 1%.

Ex-Perts are guys like me that no longer wash with that anti-dandruff shampo.
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:26:04
I think it's fine.  Leave some on the exchange so you can trade if you want to.  You can pull it off anytime (like if you get a hardware wallet).

Try Intuit's Paytrust if you really need to send checks.  I don't fool with online bill pay.
With Paytrust you just give whatever biller you have their address and Paytrust handles the rest.
Depending on the rules you set up for a particular biller they will either pay the bill on the due date automatically, send you an email that a bill is due so you can decide what to do with it, or pay the bill if it's less than x amount.  At any time you can see the scanned bills.
You can set your Mom or a friend up as a payee and have them send an ad hoc check when you need to settle a random debt.  For $11 a month I consider it indispensable.

There's nothing bad about them.  Just a business, nothing more or less.  Many people on this sub tend to subscribe ulterior motivations or anti-purist sentiments to CB.  Whatever...I just think they're in business to make money.
I for one found them easy to deal with.  Fees were reasonable and the mobile app is clean and reliable.  If you want to trade without fees, they have too (or at least they did last time I traded at the end of 2017) with GDAX.
