Blockchain based currency will give more power to every individuals. It will change the world. Internet is borderless; crypto is also. Its time to live in a world where we stop judging and acting toward borders. Its time to all look at the same objectives and move forward. One planet one vision same objectives

If I was on tv to talk about bitcoin I would say how bitcoin cash contributors scammed the whole network with insider trading and how coinbase is all about making money without supporting the network
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:19:00
Yeah but there is still a problem about fee and transaction delay.

They are not fucused on improving the bitcoin blockchain by not using the segwit update plus they added a new coin: bitcoin cash, that is very controversial and ran by drama queens.

I would take out 15~25% profit and invest 5-7% of btc in 5 to 25 other currency

Fuck coinbase, you should delete the app and try another one that is supporting bitcoin, not one that is only there to get rich and mess up the whole system.

If we want bitcoin to be the future main currency used all over the world and bank, as we know them, to DIE,  it has to be taxed.

Blockchain based currency are the future and this plus other blockchain based tech will change the way democracy works to give more power to the people.

Illegal stuff like the silk road; a platform on the dark web used to sell drugs that was using btc as a value transfer method.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:26:07
Great move, I really admire this. The blockchain based community is great and has a real desire to change the world.
Blockchain will change how the world will work: more equality beteeen people: real democracy and many other great changes are coming.

Samething happened to me, I had sent a wire to quadrigacx from my bank to a bank in germany and I hadnt had news for weeks... It took 1 month to transfer the funds... I missed the 3.8k dip in september because of it..
**YOU CAN GO TO YOUR BANK AND CANCEL THE WIRE**

I hope, all those are individuals, bitcoin aims to regroup all the individuals.

Bitcoins success has nothing to do with price bounce or whatever. Its about how easy it is to use it  fiat for casual transactions. The more people and business use it, the more btc has success.

I think a smart contract that realeases your access id on a date that you know you ll be dead would work.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:25:00
Guys, stop seeing bitcoin as short term. Yeah, all of us want 10000% asap but its just not rational to think its not risky if it happens. 
SEE bitcoin as long term, I truly believe blockchain based currency are the future and on the long term it will be worth WAY MUCH MORE THAN 12K.

Is it possible for the government to monitor or transaction and know how much we buy &amp; sell with it?
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:11:15
They have problems with the inflation and corruption, so btc ia a very good alternative... its the same case in occident but problem here is that most people are too ignorant!
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:09:48
Future is here!!

I just sold my last pair of boxer for btc. All my assets are in BTC and I plan living in my car untill it reaches 500k.. To the moon $$$$$
