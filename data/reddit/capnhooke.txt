Also if enough people accept it then there is no need to convert to local currency!

Have you considered using the i2p network instead of tor? Tor is really not designed for securely running hidden sites -- that's why they keep getting busted. Tor is intended to be used to hide your ip address on the clear internet. 
I2p is a self contained intranet, and does not connect to the outside internet. It consists entirely of hidden sites and services and is much more secure and efficient for that kind of thing.
Just a thought...

Wow my first ever tip! Cool, cheers man!!

Open source projects are usually more responsive to community input and if someone is capable of adding a feature themselves they are free to do so.

Wow cool, do you have any tips for how to find it in memory with olly? I'm still a pretty big noob with olly.
@_date: 2014-03-17 15:05:50
Thanks, that put me in the right direction.

It would be a lot less expensive for an adversary of Bitcoin to buy them out than to purchase enough mining hardware to cause a 51% attack...
@_date: 2014-06-08 15:43:44
Maybe the protocol should be changed to support nothing but p2p pools? That would prevent anything like this from happening.

As someone brand new to malware analysis, how would I "give it a go" in ollydbg? I've done some crackmes with olly but have never tried something this big. 
I can run it from olly, but was wondering how to trace? Sorry for the noob question...

Does anyone know how he unpacked the encrypted portion of the binary? 
@_date: 2014-02-20 15:01:49
Sounds like ButterflyLabs "shipping in two weeks"...

Seems just like another security risk to me. Why intentionally leave that weak link in your sites security?
@_date: 2013-02-20 14:31:24
Yeah this has happened to a lot of us. Just email support and they'll fix you up. 
@_date: 2013-02-09 17:28:20
I would if I knew how! Here's my address...

Right but the very nature of the tor protocol is not condusive to secure hidden services. I2p was literally designed for that while tor was not. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 19:56:31
Just wanted to remind everyone about the I2P network. It is designed for hidden services (like the silk road). Tor was designed to attempt to make you anonymous on the clear internet.

A decentralized exchange would be really cool! No fees perhaps? Someone should start working on it...
@_date: 2013-02-19 16:15:10
They've been pretty helpful (although a bit slow) for me via email..
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:41:55
Ahh cool thanks. Bitcoin is awesome!
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:10:37
Why is this much lag acceptable? Especially when it happens on a weekly basis? Can our community do anything about this?
@_date: 2013-05-21 21:08:02
This would be huge!

Post your wallet address. If you look in the blockchain you can see exactly where they went and when. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:18:11
Could be a perfect time for them to join in! Cheap coins!
@_date: 2013-04-19 15:46:01
Unfortunately not.
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:31:46
I know but they are more of a bonus for that network. It's main purpose is to utilize exit nodes. I2P is designed for efficient and secure hidden services making it better for a site like SR.
@_date: 2013-03-14 17:58:20
Every experience I have had with them has been "not so instant".
@_date: 2013-10-03 01:52:13
I thought it was something like that. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-21 07:24:20
Everyone needs a reminder that the I2P network is designed for hidden services like the silk road. Tor is NOT designed for them. Tor was made to improve anonymity on regular websites. I2P does not use exit nodes and is a self contained intranet. 
If there is a silk road 3, it has to be on I2P.
In the meantime... Check out the subreddit @_date: 2013-02-26 06:13:30
